<text>Risk management is the identification, evaluation, and prioritization of risks, followed by the minimization, monitoring, and control of the impact or probability of those risks occurring. Risks can come from various sources (i.e, threats) including uncertainty in international markets, political instability, dangers of project failures (at any phase in design, development, production, or sustaining of life-cycles), legal liabilities, credit risk, accidents, natural causes and disasters, deliberate attack from an adversary, or events of uncertain or unpredictable root-cause.

There are two types of events viz. Risks and Opportunities. Negative events can be classified as risks while positive events are classified as opportunities. Risk management standards have been developed by various institutions, including the Project Management Institute, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, actuarial societies, and International Organization for Standardization. Methods, definitions and goals vary widely according to whether the risk management method is in the context of project management, security, engineering, industrial processes, financial portfolios, actuarial assessments, or public health and safety. Certain risk management standards have been criticized for having no measurable improvement on risk, whereas the confidence in estimates and decisions seems to increase.

Strategies to manage threats (uncertainties with negative consequences) typically include avoiding the threat, reducing the negative effect or probability of the threat, transferring all or part of the threat to another party, and even retaining some or all of the potential or actual consequences of a particular threat. The opposite of these strategies can be used to respond to opportunities (uncertain future states with benefits).

As a professional role, a risk manager will &quot;oversee the organization&#x27;s comprehensive insurance and risk management program, assessing and identifying risks that could impede the reputation, safety, security, or financial success of the organization&quot;, and then develop plans to minimize and / or mitigate any negative (financial) outcomes. Risk Analysts support the technical side of the organization&#x27;s risk management approach: once risk data has been compiled and evaluated, analysts share their findings with their managers, who use those insights to decide among possible solutions.

==Introduction==
Risk is defined as the possibility that an event will occur that adversely affects the achievement of an objective. Uncertainty, therefore, is a key aspect of risk. Risk management appears in scientific and management literature since the 1920s. It became a formal science in the 1950s, when articles and books with &quot;risk management&quot; in the title also appear in library searches. Most of research was initially related to finance and insurance. One popular standard clarifying vocabulary used in risk management is &quot;ISO Guide 31073:2022&quot;, &quot;Risk management — Vocabulary&quot;.

Ideally in risk management, a prioritization process is followed. Whereby the risks with the greatest loss (or impact) and the greatest probability of occurring are handled first. Risks with lower probability of occurrence and lower loss are handled in descending order. In practice the process of assessing overall risk can be tricky, and organisation has to balance resources used to mitigate between risks with a higher probability but lower loss, versus a risk with higher loss but lower probability. Opportunity cost represents a unique challenge for risk managers. It can be difficult to determine when to put resources toward risk management and when to use those resources elsewhere. Again, ideal risk management optimises resource usage (spending, manpower etc), and also minimizes the negative effects of risks.

===Risks vs. opportunities===
Opportunities first appear in academic research or management books in the 1990s. The first PMBoK Project Management Body of Knowledge draft of 1987 doesn&#x27;t mention opportunities at all.

Modern project management school recognize the importance of opportunities. Opportunities have been included in project management literature since the 1990s, e.g. in PMBoK, and became a significant part of project risk management in the years 2000s, when articles titled &quot;opportunity management&quot; also begin to appear in library searches. Opportunity management thus became an important part of risk management.

Modern risk management theory deals with any type of external events, positive and negative. Positive risks are called &quot;opportunities&quot;. Similarly to risks, opportunities have specific mitigation strategies: exploit, share, enhance, ignore.

In practice, risks are considered &quot;usually negative&quot;. Risk-related research and practice focus significantly more on threats than on opportunities. This can lead to negative phenomena such as target fixation.

===Method===
For the most part, these methods consist of the following elements, performed, more or less, in the following order:

# Identify the threats.
# Assess the vulnerability of critical assets to specific threats.
# Determine the risk (i.e. the expected likelihood and consequences of specific attacks on specific assets).
# Identify ways to reduce those risks.
# Prioritize risk reduction measures.
The Risk management knowledge area, as defined by the Project Management Body of Knowledge PMBoK, consists of the following processes:

# Plan Risk Management – defining how to conduct risk management activities.
# Identify Risks – identifying individual project risks as well as sources.
# Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis – prioritizing individual project risks by assessing probability and impact.
# Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis – numerical analysis of the effects.
# Plan Risk Responses – developing options, selecting strategies and actions.
# Implement Risk Responses – implementing agreed-upon risk response plans. In the 4th Ed. of PMBoK, this process was included as an activity in the Monitor and Control process, but was later separated as a distinct process in PMBoK 6th Ed.
# Monitor Risks – monitoring the implementation. This process was known as Monitor and Control in the previous PMBoK 4th Ed., when it also included the &quot;Implement Risk Responses&quot; process.

===Principles===
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) identifies the following principles for risk management:

* Create value – resources expended to mitigate risk should be less than the consequence of inaction.
* Be an integral part of organizational processes.
* Be part of the decision-making process.
* Explicitly address uncertainty and assumptions.
* Use a systematic and structured process.
* Use the best available information.
* Be flexible.
* Take human factors into account.
* Be transparent and inclusive.
* Be dynamic, iterative and responsive to change.
* Be capable of continual improvement and enhancement.
* Continual reassessment.

===Mild versus wild risk===
Benoit Mandelbrot distinguished between &quot;mild&quot; and &quot;wild&quot; risk and argued that risk assessment and management must be fundamentally different for the two types of risk. Mild risk follows normal or near-normal probability distributions, is subject to regression to the mean and the law of large numbers, and is therefore relatively predictable. Wild risk follows fat-tailed distributions, e.g., Pareto or power-law distributions, is subject to regression to the tail (infinite mean or variance, rendering the law of large numbers invalid or ineffective), and is therefore difficult or impossible to predict. A common error in risk assessment and management is to underestimate the wildness of risk, assuming risk to be mild when in fact it is wild, which must be avoided if risk assessment and management are to be valid and reliable, according to Mandelbrot.

==Process==
According to the standard &quot;ISO 31000&quot;, &quot;Risk management – Guidelines&quot;, the process of risk management consists of several steps as follows:

===Establishing the context===
This involves:

# observing the context (the environment of the organization)
#* the social scope of risk management
#* the identity and objectives of stakeholders
#* the basis upon which risks will be evaluated, constraints.
# defining a framework for the activity and an agenda for identification
# developing an analysis of risks involved in the process
# mitigation or solution of risks using available technological, human and organizational resources

===Identification===
After establishing the context, the next step in the process of managing risk is to identify potential risks. Risks are about events that, when triggered, cause problems or benefits. Hence, risk identification can start with the source of problems and those of competitors (benefit), or with the problem&#x27;s consequences.
* Source analysis – Risk sources may be internal or external to the system that is the target of risk management (use mitigation instead of management since by its own definition risk deals with factors of decision-making that cannot be managed).
Some examples of risk sources are: stakeholders of a project, employees of a company or the weather over an airport.
* Problem analysis – Risks are related to identified threats. For example: the threat of losing money, the threat of abuse of confidential information or the threat of human errors, accidents and casualties. The threats may exist with various entities, most important with shareholders, customers and legislative bodies such as the government.
When either source or problem is known, the events that a source may trigger or the events that can lead to a problem can be investigated. For example: stakeholders withdrawing during a project may endanger funding of the project; confidential information may be stolen by employees even within a closed network; lightning striking an aircraft during takeoff may make all people on board immediate casualties.

The chosen method of identifying risks may depend on culture, industry practice and compliance. The identification methods are formed by templates or the development of templates for identifying source, problem or event. Common risk identification methods are:
* Objectives-based risk identification – Organizations and project teams have objectives. Any event that may prevent an objective from being achieved is identified as risk.
* Scenario-based risk identification – In scenario analysis different scenarios are created. The scenarios may be the alternative ways to achieve an objective, or an analysis of the interaction of forces in, for example, a market or battle. Any event that triggers an undesired scenario alternative is identified as risk – see Futures Studies for methodology used by Futurists.
* Taxonomy-based risk identification – The taxonomy in taxonomy-based risk identification is a breakdown of possible risk sources. Based on the taxonomy and knowledge of best practices, a questionnaire is compiled. The answers to the questions reveal risks.
* Common-risk checking – In several industries, lists with known risks are available. Each risk in the list can be checked for application to a particular situation.
* Risk charting – This method combines the above approaches by listing resources at risk, threats to those resources, modifying factors which may increase or decrease the risk and consequences it is wished to avoid. Creating a matrix under these headings enables a variety of approaches. One can begin with resources and consider the threats they are exposed to and the consequences of each. Alternatively one can start with the threats and examine which resources they would affect, or one can begin with the consequences and determine which combination of threats and resources would be involved to bring them about.

===Assessment===

Once risks have been identified, they must then be assessed as to their potential severity of impact (generally a negative impact, such as damage or loss) and to the probability of occurrence. 

These quantities can be either simple to measure, in the case of the value of a lost building, or impossible to know for sure in the case of an unlikely event, the probability of occurrence of which is unknown. Therefore, in the assessment process it is critical to make the best educated decisions in order to properly prioritize the implementation of the risk management plan.

Even a short-term positive improvement can have long-term negative impacts. Take the &quot;turnpike&quot; example. A highway is widened to allow more traffic. More traffic capacity leads to greater development in the areas surrounding the improved traffic capacity. Over time, traffic thereby increases to fill available capacity. Turnpikes thereby need to be expanded in a seemingly endless cycles. There are many other engineering examples where expanded capacity (to do any function) is soon filled by increased demand. Since expansion comes at a cost, the resulting growth could become unsustainable without forecasting and management.

The fundamental difficulty in risk assessment is determining the rate of occurrence since statistical information is not available on all kinds of past incidents and is particularly scanty in the case of catastrophic events, simply because of their infrequency. Furthermore, evaluating the severity of the consequences (impact) is often quite difficult for intangible assets. Asset valuation is another question that needs to be addressed. Thus, best educated opinions and available statistics are the primary sources of information. Nevertheless, risk assessment should produce such information for senior executives of the organization that the primary risks are easy to understand and that the risk management decisions may be prioritized within overall company goals. Thus, there have been several theories and attempts to quantify risks. Numerous different risk formulae exist, but perhaps the most widely accepted formula for risk quantification is: &quot;Rate (or probability) of occurrence multiplied by the impact of the event equals risk magnitude.&quot;

==Risk options==
Risk mitigation measures are usually formulated according to one or more of the following major risk options, which are:

# Design a new business process with adequate built-in risk control and containment measures from the start.
# Periodically re-assess risks that are accepted in ongoing processes as a normal feature of business operations and modify mitigation measures.
# Transfer risks to an external agency (e.g. an insurance company)
# Avoid risks altogether (e.g. by closing down a particular high-risk business area)

Later research has shown that the financial benefits of risk management are less dependent on the formula used but are more dependent on the frequency and how risk assessment is performed.

In business it is imperative to be able to present the findings of risk assessments in financial, market, or schedule terms. Robert Courtney Jr. (IBM, 1970) proposed a formula for presenting risks in financial terms. The Courtney formula was accepted as the official risk analysis method for the US governmental agencies. The formula proposes calculation of ALE (annualized loss expectancy) and compares the expected loss value to the security control implementation costs (cost–benefit analysis).

===Potential risk treatments===
Planning for risk management uses four essential techniques. Under the acceptance technique, the business intentionally assumes risks without financial protections in the hopes that possible gains will exceed prospective losses. The transfer approach shields the business from losses by shifting risks to a third party, frequently in exchange for a fee, while the third-party benefits from the project. By choosing not to participate in high-risk ventures, the avoidance strategy avoids losses but also loses out on possibilities. Last but not least, the reduction approach lowers risks by implementing strategies like insurance, which provides protection for a variety of asset classes and guarantees reimbursement in the event of losses.

Once risks have been identified and assessed, all techniques to manage the risk fall into one or more of these four major categories:

* Avoidance (eliminate, withdraw from or not become involved)
* Reduction (optimize – mitigate)
* Sharing (transfer – outsource or insure)
* Retention (accept and budget)

Ideal use of these risk control strategies may not be possible. Some of them may involve trade-offs that are not acceptable to the organization or person making the risk management decisions. Another source, from the US Department of Defense (see link), Defense Acquisition University, calls these categories ACAT, for Avoid, Control, Accept, or Transfer. This use of the ACAT acronym is reminiscent of another ACAT (for Acquisition Category) used in US Defense industry procurements, in which Risk Management figures prominently in decision making and planning.

Similarly to risks, opportunities have specific mitigation strategies: exploit, share, enhance, ignore.

====Risk avoidance====
This includes not performing an activity that could present risk. Refusing to purchase a property or business to avoid legal liability is one such example. Avoiding airplane flights for fear of hijacking. Avoidance may seem like the answer to all risks, but avoiding risks also means losing out on the potential gain that accepting (retaining) the risk may have allowed. Not entering a business to avoid the risk of loss also avoids the possibility of earning profits. Increasing risk regulation in hospitals has led to avoidance of treating higher risk conditions, in favor of patients presenting with lower risk.

====Risk reduction====
Risk reduction or &quot;optimization&quot; involves reducing the severity of the loss or the likelihood of the loss from occurring. For example, sprinklers are designed to put out a fire to reduce the risk of loss by fire. This method may cause a greater loss by water damage and therefore may not be suitable. Halon fire suppression systems may mitigate that risk, but the cost may be prohibitive as a strategy.

Acknowledging that risks can be positive or negative, optimizing risks means finding a balance between negative risk and the benefit of the operation or activity; and between risk reduction and effort applied. By effectively applying Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) management standards, organizations can achieve tolerable levels of residual risk.

Modern software development methodologies reduce risk by developing and delivering software incrementally. Early methodologies suffered from the fact that they only delivered software in the final phase of development; any problems encountered in earlier phases meant costly rework and often jeopardized the whole project. By developing in iterations, software projects can limit effort wasted to a single iteration.

Outsourcing could be an example of risk sharing strategy if the outsourcer can demonstrate higher capability at managing or reducing risks. For example, a company may outsource only its software development, the manufacturing of hard goods, or customer support needs to another company, while handling the business management itself. This way, the company can concentrate more on business development without having to worry as much about the manufacturing process, managing the development team, or finding a physical location for a center. Also, implanting controls can also be an option in reducing risk. Controls that either detect causes of unwanted events prior to the consequences occurring during use of the product, or detection of the root causes of unwanted failures that the team can then avoid. Controls may focus on management or decision-making processes. All these may help to make better decisions concerning risk.

====Risk sharing====
Briefly defined as &quot;sharing with another party the burden of loss or the benefit of gain, from a risk, and the measures to reduce a risk.&quot;

The term &#x27;risk transfer&#x27; is often used in place of risk-sharing in the mistaken belief that you can transfer a risk to a third party through insurance or outsourcing. In practice, if the insurance company or contractor go bankrupt or end up in court, the original risk is likely to still revert to the first party. As such, in the terminology of practitioners and scholars alike, the purchase of an insurance contract is often described as a &quot;transfer of risk.&quot; However, technically speaking, the buyer of the contract generally retains legal responsibility for the losses &quot;transferred&quot;, meaning that insurance may be described more accurately as a post-event compensatory mechanism. For example, a personal injuries insurance policy does not transfer the risk of a car accident to the insurance company. The risk still lies with the policyholder namely the person who has been in the accident. The insurance policy simply provides that if an accident (the event) occurs involving the policyholder then some compensation may be payable to the policyholder that is commensurate with the suffering/damage.

Methods of managing risk fall into multiple categories. Risk-retention pools are technically retaining the risk for the group, but spreading it over the whole group involves transfer among individual members of the group. This is different from traditional insurance, in that no premium is exchanged between members of the group upfront, but instead, losses are assessed to all members of the group.

====Risk retention====
Risk retention involves accepting the loss, or benefit of gain, from a risk when the incident occurs. True self-insurance falls in this category. Risk retention is a viable strategy for small risks where the cost of insuring against the risk would be greater over time than the total losses sustained. All risks that are not avoided or transferred are retained by default. This includes risks that are so large or catastrophic that either they cannot be insured against or the premiums would be infeasible. War is an example since most property and risks are not insured against war, so the loss attributed to war is retained by the insured. Also any amounts of potential loss (risk) over the amount insured is retained risk. This may also be acceptable if the chance of a very large loss is small or if the cost to insure for greater coverage amounts is so great that it would hinder the goals of the organization too much.

===Risk management plan===
Select appropriate controls or countermeasures to mitigate each risk. Risk mitigation needs to be approved by the appropriate level of management. For instance, a risk concerning the image of the organization should have top management decision behind it whereas IT management would have the authority to decide on computer virus risks.

The risk management plan should propose applicable and effective security controls for managing the risks. For example, an observed high risk of computer viruses could be mitigated by acquiring and implementing antivirus software. A good risk management plan should contain a schedule for control implementation and responsible persons for those actions. There are four basic steps of risk management plan, which are threat assessment, vulnerability assessment, impact assessment and risk mitigation strategy development.

According to ISO/IEC 27001, the stage immediately after completion of the risk assessment phase consists of preparing a Risk Treatment Plan, which should document the decisions about how each of the identified risks should be handled. Mitigation of risks often means selection of security controls, which should be documented in a Statement of Applicability, which identifies which particular control objectives and controls from the 
standard have been selected, and why.

===Implementation===
Implementation follows all of the planned methods for mitigating the effect of the risks. Purchase insurance policies for the risks that it has been decided to transferred to an insurer, avoid all risks that can be avoided without sacrificing the entity&#x27;s goals, reduce others, and retain the rest.

===Review and evaluation of the plan===
Initial risk management plans will never be perfect. Practice, experience, and actual loss results will necessitate changes in the plan and contribute information to allow possible different decisions to be made in dealing with the risks being faced.

Risk analysis results and management plans should be updated periodically. There are two primary reasons for this: 
# to evaluate whether the previously selected security controls are still applicable and effective
# to evaluate the possible risk level changes in the business environment. For example, information risks are a good example of rapidly changing business environment.

==Areas==

===Enterprise===
Enterprise risk management (ERM) defines risk as those possible events or circumstances that can have negative influences on the enterprise in question, 
where the impact can be on the very existence, the resources (human and capital), the products and services, or the customers of the enterprise, as well as external impacts on society, markets, or the environment. 
There are various defined frameworks here, where every probable risk can have a pre-formulated plan to deal with its possible consequences (to ensure &quot;contingency&quot; if the risk becomes a &quot;liability&quot;).
Managers thus analyze and monitor both the internal and external environment facing the enterprise, addressing business risk generally, and any impact on the enterprise achieving its strategic goals.
ERM thus overlaps various other disciplines - operational risk management, financial risk management etc. - but is differentiated by its strategic and long-term focus. ERM systems usually focus on safeguarding reputation, acknowledging its significant role in comprehensive risk management strategies.

===Finance===
As applied to finance, risk management concerns the techniques and practices for measuring, monitoring and controlling the market- and credit risk (and operational risk) on a firm&#x27;s balance sheet, due to a bank&#x27;s credit and trading exposure, or re a fund manager&#x27;s portfolio value; for an overview see .
* A traditional measure in banking is value at risk (VaR) – the possible loss due to adverse credit and market events. Banks seek to hedge these risks, and will hold risk capital on the net position. The Basel III framework governs the parallel regulatory capital requirements, including for operational risk.
* Fund managers employ various strategies to protect their fund value; these given their mandate and benchmark.
* Non-financial firms focus on business risk more generally, overlapping enterprise risk management: i.e. those events and occurrences which could negatively impact cash flow or profitability, and hence result in a loss of business value or a decline in share price.

===Contractual risk management===
The concept of &quot;contractual risk management&quot; emphasises the use of risk management techniques in contract deployment, i.e. managing the risks which are accepted through entry into a contract. Norwegian academic Petri Keskitalo defines &quot;contractual risk management&quot; as &quot;a practical, proactive and systematical contracting method that uses contract planning and governance to manage risks connected to business activities&quot;. In an article by Samuel Greengard published in 2010, two US legal cases are mentioned which emphasise the importance of having a strategy for dealing with risk:
*UDC v. CH2M Hill, which deals with the risk to a professional advisor who signs an indemnification provision including acceptance of a duty to defend, who may thereby pick up the legal costs of defending a client subject to a claim from a third party,
*Witt v. La Gorce Country Club, which deals with the effectiveness of a limitation of liability clause, which may, in certain jurisdictions, be found to be ineffective.

Greengard recommends using industry-standard contract language as much as possible to reduce risk as much as possible and rely on clauses which have been in use and subject to established court interpretation over a number of years.

===Customs===
Customs risk management is concerned with the risks which arise within the context of international trade and have a bearing on safety and security, including the risk that illicit drugs and counterfeit goods can pass across borders and the risk that shipments and their contents are incorrectly declared. The European Union has adopted a Customs Risk Management Framework (CRMF) applicable across the union and throughout its member states, whose aims include establishing a common level of customs control protection and a balance between the objectives of safe customs control and the facilitation of legitimate trade. Two events which prompted the European Commission to review customs risk management policy in 2012-13 were the September 11 attacks of 2001 and the 2010 transatlantic aircraft bomb plot involving packages being sent from Yemen to the United States, referred to by the Commission as &quot;the October 2010 (Yemen) incident&quot;.

===Memory institutions (museums, libraries and archives)===
===Enterprise security===
ESRM is a security program management approach that links security activities to an enterprise&#x27;s mission and business goals through risk management methods. The security leader&#x27;s role in ESRM is to manage risks of harm to enterprise assets in partnership with the business leaders whose assets are exposed to those risks. ESRM involves educating business leaders on the realistic impacts of identified risks, presenting potential strategies to mitigate those impacts, then enacting the option chosen by the business in line with accepted levels of business risk tolerance

===Medical devices===
For medical devices, risk management is a process for identifying, evaluating and mitigating risks associated with harm to people and damage to property or the environment. Risk management is an integral part of medical device design and development, production processes and evaluation of field experience, and is applicable to all types of medical devices. The evidence of its application is required by most regulatory bodies such as the US FDA. The management of risks for medical devices is described by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in ISO 14971:2019, Medical Devices—The application of risk management to medical devices, a product safety standard. The standard provides a process framework and associated requirements for management responsibilities, risk analysis and evaluation, risk controls and lifecycle risk management. Guidance on the application of the standard is available via ISO/TR 24971:2020.

The European version of the risk management standard was updated in 2009 and again in 2012 to refer to the Medical Devices Directive (MDD) and Active Implantable Medical Device Directive (AIMDD) revision in 2007, as well as the In Vitro Medical Device Directive (IVDD). The requirements of EN 14971:2012 are nearly identical to ISO 14971:2007. The differences include three &quot;(informative)&quot; Z Annexes that refer to the new MDD, AIMDD, and IVDD. These annexes indicate content deviations that include the requirement for risks to be reduced &quot;as far as possible&quot;, and the requirement that risks be mitigated by design and not by labeling on the medical device (i.e., labeling can no longer be used to mitigate risk).

Typical risk analysis and evaluation techniques adopted by the medical device industry include hazard analysis, fault tree analysis (FTA), failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), hazard and operability study (HAZOP), and risk traceability analysis for ensuring risk controls are implemented and effective (i.e. tracking risks identified to product requirements, design specifications, verification and validation results etc.). FTA analysis requires diagramming software. FMEA analysis can be done using a spreadsheet program. There are also integrated medical device risk management solutions.

Through a draft guidance, the FDA has introduced another method named &quot;Safety Assurance Case&quot; for medical device safety assurance analysis. The safety assurance case is structured argument reasoning about systems appropriate for scientists and engineers, supported by a body of evidence, that provides a compelling, comprehensible and valid case that a system is safe for a given application in a given environment. With the guidance, a safety assurance case is expected for safety critical devices (e.g. infusion devices) as part of the pre-market clearance submission, e.g. 510(k). In 2013, the FDA introduced another draft guidance expecting medical device manufacturers to submit cybersecurity risk analysis information.

===Project management===

Project risk management must be considered at the different phases of acquisition. At the beginning of a project, the advancement of technical developments, or threats presented by a competitor&#x27;s projects, may cause a risk or threat assessment and subsequent evaluation of alternatives (see Analysis of Alternatives). Once a decision is made, and the project begun, more familiar project management applications can be used:

* Planning how risk will be managed in the particular project. Plans should include risk management tasks, responsibilities, activities and budget.
* Assigning a risk officer – a team member other than a project manager who is responsible for foreseeing potential project problems. Typical characteristic of risk officer is a healthy skepticism.
* Maintaining live project risk database. Each risk should have the following attributes: opening date, title, short description, probability and importance. Optionally a risk may have an assigned person responsible for its resolution and a date by which the risk must be resolved.
* Creating anonymous risk reporting channel. Each team member should have the possibility to report risks that he/she foresees in the project.
* Preparing mitigation plans for risks that are chosen to be mitigated. The purpose of the mitigation plan is to describe how this particular risk will be handled – what, when, by whom and how will it be done to avoid it or minimize consequences if it becomes a liability.
* Summarizing planned and faced risks, effectiveness of mitigation activities, and effort spent for the risk management.

===Megaprojects (infrastructure)===
Megaprojects (sometimes also called &quot;major programs&quot;) are large-scale investment projects, typically costing more than $1 billion per project. Megaprojects include major bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, airports, seaports, power plants, dams, wastewater projects, coastal flood protection schemes, oil and natural gas extraction projects, public buildings, information technology systems, aerospace projects, and defense systems. Megaprojects have been shown to be particularly risky in terms of finance, safety, and social and environmental impacts. Risk management is therefore particularly pertinent for megaprojects and special methods and special education have been developed for such risk management.

===Natural disasters===
It is important to assess risk in regard to natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, and so on. Outcomes of natural disaster risk assessment are valuable when considering future repair costs, business interruption losses and other downtime, effects on the environment, insurance costs, and the proposed costs of reducing the risk. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction is a 2015 international accord that has set goals and targets for disaster risk reduction in response to natural disasters. There are regular International Disaster and Risk Conferences in Davos to deal with integral risk management.

Several tools can be used to assess risk and risk management of natural disasters and other climate events, including geospatial modeling, a key component of land change science. This modeling requires an understanding of geographic distributions of people as well as an ability to calculate the likelihood of a natural disaster occurring.

===Wilderness===
The management of risks to persons and property in wilderness and remote natural areas has developed with increases in outdoor recreation participation and decreased social tolerance for loss. Organizations providing commercial wilderness experiences can now align with national and international consensus standards for training and equipment such as ANSI/NASBLA 101-2017 (boating), UIAA 152 (ice climbing tools), and European Norm 13089:2015 + A1:2015 (mountaineering equipment). The Association for Experiential Education offers accreditation for wilderness adventure programs. The Wilderness Risk Management Conference provides access to best practices, and specialist organizations provide wilderness risk management consulting and training.

The text Outdoor Safety – Risk Management for Outdoor Leaders, published by the New Zealand Mountain Safety Council, provides a view of wilderness risk management from the New Zealand perspective, recognizing the value of national outdoor safety legislation and devoting considerable attention to the roles of judgment and decision-making processes in wilderness risk management.

One popular models for risk assessment is the Risk Assessment and Safety Management (RASM) Model developed by Rick Curtis, author of The Backpacker&#x27;s Field Manual. The formula for the RASM Model is: Risk = Probability of Accident × Severity of Consequences. The RASM Model weighs negative risk—the potential for loss, against positive risk—the potential for growth.

===Information technology===

IT risk is a risk related to information technology. This is a relatively new term due to an increasing awareness that information security is simply one facet of a multitude of risks that are relevant to IT and the real world processes it supports. &quot;Cybersecurity is tied closely to the advancement of technology. It lags only long enough for incentives like black markets to evolve and new exploits to be discovered. There is no end in sight for the advancement of technology, so we can expect the same from cybersecurity.&quot;

ISACA&#x27;s &quot;Risk IT&quot; framework ties IT risk to enterprise risk management. Duty of Care Risk Analysis (DoCRA) evaluates risks and their safeguards and considers the interests of all parties potentially affected by those risks. The Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) features how organizations can leverage the Veris Community Database (VCDB) to estimate risk. Using HALOCK methodology within CIS RAM and data from VCDB, professionals can determine threat likelihood for their industries.

IT risk management includes &quot;incident handling&quot;, an action plan for dealing with intrusions, cyber-theft, denial of service, fire, floods, and other security-related events. According to the SANS Institute, it is a six step process: Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned.

===Operations===

Operational risk management (ORM) is the oversight of operational risk, including the risk of loss resulting from: inadequate or failed internal processes and systems; human factors; or external events. Given the nature of operations, ORM is typically a &quot;continual&quot; process, and will include ongoing risk assessment, risk decision making, and the implementation of risk controls.

===Petroleum and natural gas===
For the offshore oil and gas industry, operational risk management is regulated by the safety case regime in many countries. Hazard identification and risk assessment tools and techniques are described in the international standard ISO 17776:2000, and organisations such as the IADC (International Association of Drilling Contractors) publish guidelines for Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Case development which are based on the ISO standard. Further, diagrammatic representations of hazardous events are often expected by governmental regulators as part of risk management in safety case submissions; these are known as bow-tie diagrams (see Network theory in risk assessment). The technique is also used by organisations and regulators in mining, aviation, health, defence, industrial and finance.

===Pharmaceutical sector===
The principles and tools for quality risk management are increasingly being applied to different aspects of pharmaceutical quality systems. These aspects include development, manufacturing, distribution, inspection, and submission/review processes throughout the lifecycle of drug substances, drug products, biological and biotechnological products (including the use of raw materials, solvents, excipients, packaging and labeling materials in drug products, biological and biotechnological products). Risk management is also applied to the assessment of microbiological contamination in relation to pharmaceutical products and cleanroom manufacturing environments.

===Supply chain ===

Supply chain risk management (SCRM) aims at maintaining supply chain continuity in the event of scenarios or incidents which could interrupt normal business and hence profitability. Risks to the supply chain range from everyday to exceptional, including unpredictable natural events (such as tsunamis and pandemics) to counterfeit products, and reach across quality, security, to resiliency and product integrity. Mitigation of these risks can involve various elements of the business including logistics and cybersecurity, as well as the areas of finance and operations.

===Travel===
Travel risk management is concerned with how organisations assess the risks to their staff when travelling, especially when travelling overseas. In the field of international standards, ISO 31030:2021 addresses good practice in travel risk management.

The Global Business Travel Association&#x27;s education and research arm, the GBTA Foundation. found in 2015 that most businesses covered by their research employed travel risk management protocols aimed at ensuring the safety and well-being of their business travelers. Six key principles of travel risk awareness put forward by the association are preparation, awareness of surroundings and people, keeping a low profile, adopting an unpredictable routine, communications and layers of protection. Traveler tracking using mobile tracking and messaging technologies had by 2015 become a widely used aspect of travel risk management.

<text>René Karl Wilhelm Johann Josef Maria Rilke (4 December 1875 – 29 December 1926), known as Rainer Maria Rilke (), was an Austrian poet and novelist. Acclaimed as an idiosyncratic and expressive poet, he is widely recognized as a significant writer in the German language. His work is viewed by critics and scholars as possessing undertones of mysticism, exploring themes of subjective experience and disbelief. His writings include one novel, several collections of poetry and several volumes of correspondence.

Rilke traveled extensively throughout Europe, finally settling in Switzerland, which provided the inspiration for many of his poems. While Rilke is best known for his contributions to German literature, he also wrote in French. Among English-language readers, his best-known works include two poetry collections: &quot;Duino Elegies&quot; (&#x27;) and &quot;[[Sonnets to Orpheus]]&quot; (&#x27;), a semi-autobiographical novel &quot;The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge&quot; (&#x27;), and a collection of ten letters published posthumously &quot;[[Letters to a Young Poet]]&quot; (&#x27;). In the later 20th century, his work found new audiences in citations by self-help authors and frequent quotations in television shows, books and motion pictures.

==Biography==
===Early life (1875–1896)===

He was born René Karl Wilhelm Johann Josef Maria Rilke in Prague, capital of Kingdom of Bohemia (then part of Austria-Hungary, now capital of the Czech Republic). His childhood and youth in Prague were not always happy. His father, Josef Rilke (1838–1906), found employment as a railway official after an unsuccessful military career. His mother, Sophie (&quot;Phia&quot;) Entz (1851–1931), was from a well-to-do family in Prague, the Entz-Kinzelbergers, who lived at Herrengasse (Panská) 8, where René spent many of his early years. The relationship between Phia and her only son was coloured by her mourning for an earlier infant daughter who died within one week. During Rilke&#x27;s early years, Phia acted as if she sought to recover the lost daughter by treating Rilke as if he were a girl. According to Rilke, he had to wear &quot;fine clothes&quot; and &quot;was a plaything [for his mother], like a big doll&quot;. His parents&#x27; marriage ended in 1884. 

His parents enrolled the poetically and artistically talented youth in a military academy in Sankt Pölten, Lower Austria. He attended classes from 1886 until 1891, but left due to illness. He then moved to Linz, and entered a trade school. During this time he lived with Hans Drouot (publisher and owner of the printing and publishing company Jos. Feichtingers Erben) at Graben 19 on the 3rd floor.

Expelled in May 1892, the 16-year-old returned to Prague, where, for three years, he was tutored for the university entrance exam, which he passed in 1895. He took classes in literature, art history, and philosophy in Prague, until 1896 when he left school and moved to Munich.

===Munich and Saint Petersburg===
Rilke met and fell in love with the widely travelled and intellectual woman of letters Lou Andreas-Salomé in 1897 in Munich. He changed his first name from &quot;René&quot; to &quot;Rainer&quot; at Salomé&#x27;s urging because she thought that name to be more masculine, forceful and Germanic. His relationship with this married woman, with whom he undertook two extensive trips to Russia, lasted until 1900. Even after their separation, Salomé continued to be Rilke&#x27;s most important confidante until the end of his life. Having trained from 1912 to 1913 as a psychoanalyst with Sigmund Freud, she shared her knowledge of psychoanalysis with Rilke.

In 1898, Rilke undertook a journey of several weeks to Italy. The following year he travelled with Lou and her husband, Friedrich Carl Andreas, to Moscow where he met the novelist Leo Tolstoy. Between May and August 1900, a second journey to Russia, accompanied only by Lou, again took him to Moscow and Saint Petersburg, where he met the family of Boris Pasternak and Spiridon Drozhzhin, a peasant poet. Author Anna A. Tavis cites the cultures of Bohemia and Russia as the key influences on Rilke&#x27;s poetry and consciousness.

In 1900, Rilke stayed at the artists&#x27; colony at Worpswede. (Later, his portrait would be painted by the proto-expressionist Paula Modersohn-Becker, whom he got to know at Worpswede.) It was here that he got to know the sculptor Clara Westhoff, whom he married the following year. Their daughter Ruth (1901–1972) was born in December 1901.

===Paris (1902–1910)===

In the summer of 1902, Rilke left home and travelled to Paris to write a monograph on the sculptor Auguste Rodin. Before long his wife left their daughter with her parents and joined Rilke there. The relationship between Rilke and Clara Westhoff continued for the rest of his life; a mutually-agreed-upon effort towards a divorce was bureaucratically hindered by the fact that Rilke was a Catholic, albeit a non-practising one.

At first, Rilke had a difficult time in Paris, an experience that he called upon in the first part of his only novel, &quot;The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge&quot;. At the same time his encounter with modernism was very stimulating: Rilke became deeply involved with the sculpture of Rodin and then the work of Paul Cézanne. For a time, he acted as Rodin&#x27;s secretary, also lecturing and writing a long essay on Rodin and his work. Rodin taught him the value of objective observation and, under this influence, Rilke dramatically transformed his poetic style from the subjective and sometimes incantatory language of his earlier work into something quite new in European literature. The result was the &quot;New Poems&quot;, famous for the &quot;thing-poems&quot; expressing Rilke&#x27;s rejuvenated artistic vision. During these years, Paris increasingly became the writer&#x27;s main residence.

The most important works of the Paris period were &quot;Neue Gedichte&quot; (&quot;New Poems&quot;) (1907), &quot;Der Neuen Gedichte Anderer Teil&quot; (&quot;Another Part of the New Poems&quot;) (1908), the two &quot;Requiem&quot; poems (1909), and the novel &quot;The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge&quot;, started in 1904 and completed in January 1910.

During the later part of this decade, Rilke spent extended periods in Ronda, the famous bullfighting centre in southern Spain, where he kept a permanent room at the Hotel Reina Victoria from December 1912 to February 1913.

===Duino and the First World War (1911–1919)===

Between October 1911 and May 1912, Rilke stayed at the Castle Duino, near Trieste, home of Princess Marie of Thurn und Taxis. There, in 1912, he began the poem cycle called the &quot;Duino Elegies&quot;, which would remain unfinished for a decade because of a long-lasting creativity crisis. Rilke had developed an admiration for El Greco as early as 1908, so he visited Toledo during the winter of 1912/13 to see his paintings. It has been suggested that El Greco&#x27;s manner of depicting angels influenced the conception of the angel in the &quot;Duino Elegies&quot;. The outbreak of World War I surprised Rilke during a stay in Germany. He was unable to return to Paris, where his property was confiscated and auctioned. He spent the greater part of the war in Munich. From 1914 to 1916 he had a turbulent affair with the painter Lou Albert-Lasard. Rilke was called up at the beginning of 1916 and had to undertake basic training in Vienna. Influential friends interceded on his behalf – he was transferred to the War Records Office and discharged from the military on 9 June 1916. He returned to Munich, interrupted by a stay at manor in Westphalia. The traumatic experience of military service, a reminder of the horrors of the military academy, almost completely silenced him as a poet.

===Switzerland and Muzot (1919–1926)===
On 11 June 1919, Rilke travelled from Munich to Switzerland. He met Polish-German painter Baladine Klossowska, with whom he was in relationship to his death in 1926. The outward motive was an invitation to lecture in Zurich, but the real reason was the wish to escape the post-war chaos and take up his work on the &quot;Duino Elegies&quot; once again. The search for a suitable and affordable place to live proved to be very difficult. Among other places, Rilke lived in Soglio, Locarno and Berg am Irchel. It was only in mid-1921 that he was able to find a permanent residence in the Château de Muzot in the commune of Veyras, close to Sierre in Valais. In an intense creative period, Rilke completed the &quot;Duino Elegies&quot; in several weeks in February 1922. Before and after this period, Rilke rapidly wrote both parts of the poem cycle &quot;Sonnets to Orpheus&quot; containing 55 entire sonnets. Together, these two have often been taken as constituting the high points of Rilke&#x27;s work. In May 1922, Rilke&#x27;s patron Werner Reinhart bought and renovated Muzot so that Rilke could live there rent-free.

During this time, Reinhart introduced Rilke to his protégée, the Australian violinist Alma Moodie. Rilke was so impressed with her playing that he wrote in a letter: &quot;What a sound, what richness, what determination. That and the &quot;Sonnets to Orpheus&quot;, those were two strings of the same voice. And she plays mostly Bach! Muzot has received its musical christening...&quot;

From 1923 on, Rilke increasingly struggled with health problems that necessitated many long stays at a sanatorium in Territet near Montreux on Lake Geneva. His long stay in Paris between January and August 1925 was an attempt to escape his illness through a change in location and living conditions. Despite this, numerous important individual poems appeared in the years 1923–1926 (including &quot;Gong&quot; and &quot;Mausoleum&quot;), as well as his abundant lyrical work in French. His book of French poems &quot;Vergers&quot; was published in 1926.

In 1924, began writing poems to Rilke, who wrote back with approximately 50 poems of his own and called her verse a &quot;Herzlandschaft&quot; (landscape of the heart). This was the only time Rilke had a productive poetic collaboration throughout all his work. Mitterer visited Rilke in November 1925. In 1950 her &quot;Correspondence in Verse&quot; with Rilke was published and received much praise.

Rilke supported the Russian Revolution in 1917 as well as the Bavarian Soviet Republic in 1919. He became friends with Ernst Toller and mourned the deaths of Rosa Luxemburg, Kurt Eisner, and Karl Liebknecht. He confided that of the five or six newspapers he read daily, those on the far left came closest to his own opinions. He developed a reputation for supporting left-wing causes and thus, out of fear for his own safety, became more reticent about politics after the Bavarian Republic was crushed by the right-wing Freikorps. In January and February 1926, Rilke wrote three letters to the Mussolini-adversary Aurelia Gallarati Scotti in which he praised Benito Mussolini and described fascism as a healing agent.

===Death and burial===

Shortly before his death, Rilke&#x27;s illness was diagnosed as leukemia. He suffered ulcerous sores in his mouth, pain troubled his stomach and intestines, and he struggled with increasingly low spirits. Open-eyed, he died in the arms of his doctor on 29 December 1926, in the Valmont Sanatorium in Switzerland. He was buried on 2 January 1927, in the Raron cemetery to the west of Visp.

Rilke had chosen as his own epitaph this poem:
&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:2em; float:left;&quot;&gt;Rose, oh reiner Widerspruch, Lust,
Niemandes Schlaf zu sein unter soviel
Lidern.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;Rose, o pure contradiction, desire
to be no one&#x27;s sleep beneath so many
lids.&lt;/poem&gt;

A myth developed surrounding his death and roses. It was said: &quot;To honour a visitor, the Egyptian beauty Nimet Eloui Bey, Rilke gathered some roses from his garden. While doing so, he pricked his hand on a thorn. This small wound failed to heal, grew rapidly worse, soon his entire arm was swollen, and his other arm became affected as well&quot;, and so he died.

==Writings==

===&quot;The Panther&quot;===

The motion of the bars has made his gaze
so tired that it can hold no more.
For him there are a thousand bars
and behind those bars no world.

In soft and silken steps he paces,
softly in an ever smaller round,
like a dance of power circling a place
at whose center a deadened will is found.

Only rarely does the curtain of the eye
lift up without a sound. Then an image enters,
goes through the clenched and silent limbs,
to enter the heart and die.

&quot;The Panther&quot; was an influential poem describing life from the perspective of an animal in a zoo, which focused more on its cage than on humans, one of the first to do so, part of an early counter-movement against anthropomorphic views of animals and nature along with individuals such as Jakob von Uexküll, a writer of perspectives of creatures such as jellyfish and ticks, a man who he corresponded with, and poet Hugo von Hofmannsthal who wrote from the perspective of a man who had language become like &#x27;rotten mushrooms&#x27; in his mouth.

===&quot;The Book of Hours&quot;===

Rilke&#x27;s three complete cycles of poems that constitute &quot;The Book of Hours&quot; (&quot;&quot;) were published by Insel Verlag in April 1905. These poems explore the Christian search for God and the nature of Prayer, using symbolism from Saint Francis and Rilke&#x27;s observation of Orthodox Christianity during his travels to Ukraine in the early years of the twentieth century.

===&quot;The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge&quot;===

Rilke wrote his only novel, &quot;&quot; (translated as &quot;The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge&quot;), while living in Paris, completing the work in 1910. The narrative takes the form of a rambling novelette filled with poetic language and contains, among other things, a retelling of the prodigal son tale, a striking description of death by illness, an ode to the joys of roaming free during childhood, a chilling description of how people wear false faces with others, and a snarky comment about the weirdness of neighbors.

This semi-autobiographical novel adopts the style and technique that became associated with Expressionism which entered European fiction and art in the early 20th century. He was inspired by Sigbjørn Obstfelder&#x27;s work &quot;A Priest&#x27;s Diary&quot; and Jens Peter Jacobsen&#x27;s novel &quot;Niels Lyhne&quot; (1880) which traces the fate of an atheist in a merciless world. Rilke addresses existential themes, profoundly probing the quest for individuality and the significance of death and reflecting on the experience of time as death approaches. He draws considerably on the writings of Nietzsche, whose work he came to know through Lou Andreas-Salomé. His work also incorporates impressionistic techniques that were influenced by Cézanne and Rodin (to whom Rilke was secretary in 1905–1906). He combines these techniques and motifs to conjure images of mankind&#x27;s anxiety and alienation in the face of an increasingly scientific, industrial and reified world.

===&quot;Duino Elegies&quot;===

Rilke began writing the elegies in 1912 while a guest of Princess Marie von Thurn und Taxis (1855–1934) at Duino Castle, near Trieste on the Adriatic Sea. During this ten-year period, the elegies languished incomplete for long stretches of time as Rilke suffered frequently from severe depression, some of which was caused by the events of World War I and his conscripted military service. Aside from brief episodes of writing in 1913 and 1915, Rilke did not return to the work until a few years after the war ended. With a sudden, renewed inspiration – writing in a frantic pace he described as &quot;a savage creative storm&quot; – he completed the collection in February 1922 while staying at Château de Muzot in Veyras, in Switzerland&#x27;s Rhône Valley. After their publication and his death shortly thereafter, the &quot;Duino Elegies&quot; were quickly recognized by critics and scholars as Rilke&#x27;s most important work.

The &quot;Duino Elegies&quot; are intensely religious, mystical poems that weigh beauty and existential suffering. The poems employ a rich symbolism of angels and salvation but not in keeping with typical Christian interpretations. Rilke begins the first elegy in an invocation of philosophical despair, asking: &quot;Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the hierarchies of angels?&quot; (&quot;Wer, wenn ich schriee, hörte mich denn aus der Engel Ordnungen?&quot;) and later declares that &quot;every angel is terrifying&quot; (&quot;Jeder Engel ist schrecklich&quot;). While labelling of these poems as &quot;elegies&quot; would typically imply melancholy and lamentation, many passages are marked by their positive energy and &quot;unrestrained enthusiasm&quot;. Together, the &quot;Duino Elegies&quot; are described as a metamorphosis of Rilke&#x27;s &quot;ontological torment&quot; and an &quot;impassioned monologue about coming to terms with human existence&quot; discussing themes of &quot;the limitations and insufficiency of the human condition and fractured human consciousness ... man&#x27;s loneliness, the perfection of the angels, life and death, love and lovers, and the task of the poet&quot;.

===&quot;Sonnets to Orpheus&quot;===

With news of the death of Wera Knoop (1900–1919), his daughter&#x27;s friend, Rilke was inspired to create and set to work on &quot;Sonnets to Orpheus&quot;. In 1922, between February 2 and 5, he completed the first section of 26 sonnets. For the next few days, he focused on the &quot;Duino Elegies&quot;, completing them on the evening of February 11. Immediately thereafter, he returned to work on the &quot;Sonnets&quot; and completed the following section of 29 sonnets in less than two weeks. Throughout the &quot;Sonnets&quot;, Wera is frequently referenced, both directly by name and indirectly in allusions to a &quot;dancer&quot; and the mythical Eurydice. Although Rilke claimed that the entire cycle was inspired by Wera, she appears as a character in only one of the poems. He insisted, however, that &quot;Wera&#x27;s own figure ... nevertheless governs and moves the course of the whole.&quot;

The sonnets&#x27; contents are, as is typical of Rilke, highly metaphorical. The character of Orpheus (whom Rilke refers to as the &quot;god with the lyre&quot;) appears several times in the cycle, as do other mythical characters such as Daphne. There are also biblical allusions, including a reference to Esau. Other themes involve animals, peoples of different cultures, and time and death.

===&quot;Letters to a Young Poet&quot;===
In 1929, writer Franz Xaver Kappus (1883–1966) published a collection of ten letters that (then between 27-32 year old) Rilke had written to him over the course of 6 years, beginning when Kappus was a 19-year-old officer cadet studying at the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt, where he had a professor who had taught Rilke at the boarding Military Middleschool (Militär-Unterrealschule) in St.-Pölten over 15 years earlier (from 1886-1891); (before Rilke dropped out of the officer&#x27;s education after a year in Military highschool). Between 1902 and 1908, the young Kappus had written Rilke when he was uncertain about his future as a military officer or as a poet. Initially he sought Rilke&#x27;s advice as to the quality of his poetry and whether he ought to pursue writing as a career. While he declined to comment much on Kappus&#x27;s writings, Rilke advised Kappus on how a poet should feel, love and seek truth in trying to understand and experience the world around him and engage the world of art. These letters offer insight into the ideas and themes that appear in Rilke&#x27;s poetry and his working process and were written during a key period of Rilke&#x27;s early artistic development after his reputation as a poet began to be established with the publication of parts of &quot;Das Stunden-Buch&quot; (&quot;The Book of Hours&quot;) and &quot;Das Buch der Bilder&quot; (&quot;The Book of Images&quot;).

==Style and themes==
Rilke extensively engaged with metaphors, metonymy and contradictions in his poetry and prose to convey disbelief and a crisis of faith. Figures from Greek mythology, such as Apollo, Hermes and Orpheus, recur as motifs in his poems and are depicted in original interpretations that often double as analogies for his experiences. Rilke&#x27;s poems also feature figures of angels, famously described in the &quot;Duino Elegies&quot; as &quot;terrifying&quot; (&quot;&quot;); he also occasionally explored the crisis of his Catholic faith, including in his little-known 1898 poem &quot;Visions of Christ&quot;, where he depicted Mary Magdalene as the mother of Jesus&#x27; child.

===Legacy===

Rilke is one of the best-selling poets in the United States. In popular culture, Rilke is frequently quoted or referenced in television shows, motion pictures, music and other works when these works discuss the subject of love or angels. His work is often described as &quot;mystical&quot; and has been quoted and referenced by self-help authors. Rilke has been reinterpreted &quot;as a master who can lead us to a more fulfilled and less anxious life&quot;.

Rilke&#x27;s work has influenced several poets and writers, including William H. Gass, Galway Kinnell, Sidney Keyes, Stephen Spender, Robert Bly, W. S. Merwin, John Ashbery, novelist Thomas Pynchon and the philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer. British poet W. H. Auden (1907–1973) has been described as &quot;Rilke&#x27;s most influential English disciple&quot; and he frequently &quot;paid homage to him&quot; or used the imagery of angels in his work.

The U.S. rock music band Rainer Maria was named after Rilke.

<doc id="26410" wikidata="Q1538947" url="?curid=26410" title="Conversion therapy">
<text>Conversion therapy is the pseudoscientific practice of attempting to change an individual&#x27;s sexual orientation, romantic orientation, gender identity, or gender expression to align with heterosexual and cisgender norms. Methods that have been used to this end include forms of brain surgery, surgical or chemical (hormonal) castration, aversion therapy treatments such as electric shocks, nausea-inducing drugs, hypnosis, counseling, spiritual interventions, visualization, psychoanalysis, and arousal reconditioning. There is a scientific consensus that conversion therapy is ineffective at changing a person&#x27;s sexual orientation or gender identity and that it frequently causes significant long-term psychological harm. The position of current evidence-based medicine and clinical guidance is that homosexuality, bisexuality, and gender variance are natural and healthy aspects of human sexuality. An increasing number of jurisdictions around the world have passed laws against conversion therapy.

Historically, conversion therapy was the treatment of choice for individuals who disclosed same-sex attractions or exhibited gender nonconformity, which were formerly assumed to be pathologies by the medical establishment. When performed today, conversion therapy may constitute fraud, and when performed on minors, a form of child abuse; it has been described by experts as torture; cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment; and contrary to human rights.

==Terminology ==
Medical professionals and activists consider &quot;conversion therapy&quot; a misnomer, as it does not constitute a legitimate form of therapy. Alternative terms include sexual orientation change efforts (SOCE) and gender identity change efforts (GICE)—together, sexual orientation and gender identity change efforts (SOGICE). According to researcher Douglas C. Haldeman, SOCE and GICE should be considered together because both rest on the assumption &quot;that gender-related behavior consistent with the individual&#x27;s birth sex is normative and anything else is unacceptable and should be changed&quot;. &quot;Reparative therapy&quot; may refer to conversion therapy in general, or to a subset thereof.

Advocates of conversion therapy do not necessarily use the term either, instead using phrases such as &quot;healing from sexual brokenness&quot; and &quot;struggling with same-sex attraction&quot;.

==History==
=== Sexual orientation change efforts (SOCE) ===
The term &quot;homosexual&quot; was coined by German-speaking Hungarian writer Karl Maria Kertbeny and was in circulation by the 1880s. Into the middle of the twentieth century, competing views of homosexuality were advanced by psychoanalysis versus academic sexology. Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, viewed homosexuality as a form of arrested development. Later psychoanalysts followed Sandor Rado, who argued that homosexuality was a &quot;phobic avoidance of heterosexuality caused by inadequate early parenting&quot;. This line of thinking was popular in psychiatric models of homosexuality based on the prison population or homosexuals seeking treatment. In contrast, sexology researchers such as Alfred Kinsey argued that homosexuality was a normal variation in human development. In 1970, gay activists confronted the American Psychiatric Association, persuading the association to reconsider whether homosexuality should be listed as a disorder. The APA delisted homosexuality in 1973, which contributed to shifts in public opinion on homosexuality.

Despite their lack of scientific backing, some socially or religiously conservative activists continued to argue that if one person&#x27;s sexuality could be changed, homosexuality was not a fixed class such as race. Borrowing from discredited psychoanalytic ideas about the cause of homosexuality, some of these individuals offered conversion therapy. In 2001, conversion therapy attracted attention when Robert L. Spitzer published a non-peer-reviewed study asserting that some homosexuals could change their sexual orientation. Many researchers made methodological criticisms of the study, which Spitzer later repudiated.

=== Gender identity change efforts (GICE) ===
Gender Identity Change Efforts (GICE) refer to practices of healthcare providers and religious counselors with the goal of attempting to alter a person&#x27;s gender identity or expression to conform to social norms. Examples include aversion therapy, cognitive restructuring, and psychoanalytic and talk therapies. Western medical-model narratives have historically institutionalized transphobia: systemically favoring a binary gender model and pathologizing gender diversity and non-conformity. This aided the development and proliferation of GICE. 

Early interventions were rooted in psychoanalytic hypotheses. Robert Stoller advanced the theory that gender-nonconforming behavior and expression in children assigned male at birth (AMAB) was caused by being overly close to their mother. Richard Green continued his research; his methods for altering behavior included having the father spend more time with the child and mother less, expecting both to exhibit stereotypical gender roles, and having them praise their child&#x27;s masculine behaviors, and shame their feminine and gender-nonconforming ones. These interventions resulted in depression in the children and feelings of betrayal from parents that the treatments failed.

In the 1970s, UCLA psychologist Richard Green recruited Ole Ivar Lovaas to adapt the techniques of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy to attempt to prevent children from becoming transsexual. Deemed the &quot;Feminine Boy Project&quot;, the treatments used operant conditioning to reward gender-conforming behaviors, and punish gender non-conforming behaviors.
Kenneth Zucker at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health adopted Richard Green&#x27;s methods, but narrowed the scope to attempting to prevent the child from identifying as transgender by modifying gender behavior and presentation to conform to the expectations of the assigned gender at birth, which he dubbed the &quot;living in your own skin&quot; model. His model used the same interventions as Green with the addition of psychodynamic therapy.

==Motivations==
A frequent motivation for adults who pursue conversion therapy is their religious beliefs, especially evangelical Christianity and Orthodox Judaism, that disapprove of same-sex relations. These adults prioritize maintaining a good relationship with their family and religious community. Adolescents who are pressured by their families into undergoing conversion therapy also typically come from a conservative religious background. Youth from families with low socioeconomic status are also more likely to undergo conversion therapy.

==Theories and techniques==
As societal attitudes toward homosexuality have become more tolerant over time, the most harsh conversion therapy methods such as aversion have been reduced. Secular conversion therapy is offered less often due to reduced medical pathologization of homosexuality, and religious practitioners have become more dominant.

===Aversion therapy===
Aversion therapy used on homosexuals included electric shock and nausea-inducing drugs during presentation of same-sex erotic images. Cessation of the aversive stimuli was typically accompanied by the presentation of opposite-sex erotic images, with the objective of strengthening heterosexual feelings. Another method used was the covert sensitization method, which involves instructing patients to imagine vomiting or receiving electric shocks, writing that only single case studies have been conducted, and that their results cannot be generalized. Haldeman writes that behavioral conditioning studies tend to decrease homosexual feelings, but do not increase heterosexual feelings, citing Rangaswami&#x27;s &quot;Difficulties in arousing and increasing heterosexual responsiveness in a homosexual: A case report&quot;, published in 1982, as typical in this respect.

Other methods of aversion therapy in addition to electric shock included ice baths, freezing, burning via metal coils, and hard labor. The intent was for the subject to associate homosexual feelings with pain and thus result in them being reduced. These methods have been concluded to be ineffective.

Aversion therapy was developed in Czechoslovakia between 1950 and 1962 and in the British Commonwealth from 1961 into the mid-1970s. In the context of the Cold War, Western psychologists ignored the poor results of their Czechoslovak counterparts, who had concluded that aversion therapy was not effective by 1961 and recommended decriminalization of homosexuality instead. Some men in the United Kingdom were offered the choice between prison and undergoing aversion therapy. It was also offered to a few British women, but was never the standard treatment for either homosexual men or women.

In the 1970s, behaviorist Hans Eysenck was one of the main advocates of counterconditioning with malaise-inducing drugs and electric shock for homosexuals. He wrote that this type of therapy was successful in nearly 50% of cases. However, his studies were disputed.
Behavior therapists, including Eysenck, used aversive methods. This led to a protest against Eysenck by gay activist Peter Tatchell in a London Medical Group Symposium in 1972. Tatchell said that the therapy promoted by Eysenck was a form of torture.
Tatchell denounced Eysenck&#x27;s form of behavioral therapy as inducing depression and suicide among gay men who were subjected to it.

===Brain surgery===

In the 1940s and 1950s, U.S. neurologist Walter Freeman popularized the ice-pick lobotomy as a treatment for homosexuality. He personally performed as many as 3,439 lobotomy surgeries in 23 states, of which 2,500 used his ice-pick procedure, despite the fact that he had no formal surgical training.

In West Germany, a type of brain surgery usually involving destruction of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus was done to some homosexual men during the 1960s and 1970s. The practice was criticized by sexologist Volkmar Sigusch.

===Castration and transplantation===
In early twentieth century Germany, experiments were carried out in which homosexual men were subjected to unilateral orchiectomy and testicles of heterosexual men were transplanted. These operations were a complete failure.

Surgical castration of homosexual men was widespread in Europe in the first half of the twentieth century. SS leader Heinrich Himmler ordered homosexual men to be sent to concentration camps because he did not consider a time-limited prison sentence was sufficient to eliminate homosexuality. Although theoretically voluntary, some homosexuals were subject to severe pressure and coercion to agree to castration. There was no age limit; some boys as young as 16 were castrated. Those who agreed to castration after a Paragraph 175 conviction were exempted from being transferred to a concentration camp after completing their legal sentence. Some concentration camp prisoners were also subjected to castration. An estimated 400 to 800 men were castrated.

Endocrinologist Carl Vaernet attempted to change homosexual concentration camp prisoners&#x27; sexual orientations by implanting a pellet that released testosterone. Most of the victims, non-consenting prisoners at Buchenwald, died shortly thereafter.

An unknown number of men were castrated in West Germany and chemical castration was used in other Western countries, notably against Alan Turing in the United Kingdom.

===Ex-gay/ex-trans ministries===

Ex-gay ministries are religious groups that attempt to use religion to eliminate or change somebody&#x27;s sexual orientation. The ex-gay umbrella organization Exodus International in the United States ceased activities in June 2013, and the three member board issued a statement which repudiated its aims and apologized for the harm their pursuit has caused to LGBT people. Ex-trans organizations often overlap and portray being trans as inherently sinful or against God&#x27;s design, or pathologize gender variance as due to trauma, social contagion, or &quot;gender ideology.&quot;

=== Hypnosis ===
Hypnosis was used in conversion therapy since the 19th century by Richard von Krafft-Ebing and Albert von Schrenck-Notzing. In 1967, Canadian psychiatrist Peter Roper published a case study of treating 15 homosexual (some of which would probably be considered bisexual by modern standards) people with hypnosis. Allegedly, 8 showed &quot;marked improvement&quot; (they reportedly lost sexual attraction towards the same sex altogether), 4 mild improvements (decrease of &quot;homosexual tendencies&quot;), and 3 no improvement after hypnotic treatment; he concluded that &quot;hypnosis may well produce more satisfactory results than those obtainable by other means&quot;, depending on the hypnotic susceptibility of the subjects.

===Psychoanalysis===
Haldeman writes that psychoanalytic treatment of homosexuality is exemplified by the work of Irving Bieber &quot;et al.&quot; in &quot;Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals&quot;. They advocated long-term therapy aimed at resolving the unconscious childhood conflicts that they considered responsible for homosexuality. Haldeman notes that Bieber&#x27;s methodology has been criticized because it relied upon a clinical sample, the description of the outcomes was based upon subjective therapist impression, and follow-up data were poorly presented. Bieber reported a 27% success rate from long-term therapy, but only 18% of the patients in whom Bieber considered the treatment successful had been exclusively homosexual to begin with, while 50% had been bisexual. In Haldeman&#x27;s view, this makes even Bieber&#x27;s unimpressive claims of success misleading.

Haldeman discusses other psychoanalytic studies of attempts to change homosexuality. Curran and Parr&#x27;s &quot;Homosexuality: An analysis of 100 male cases&quot;, published in 1957, reported no significant increase in heterosexual behavior. Mayerson and Lief&#x27;s &quot;Psychotherapy of homosexuals: A follow-up study of nineteen cases&quot;, published in 1965, reported that half of its 19 subjects were exclusively heterosexual in behavior four and a half years after treatment, but its outcomes were based on patient self-report and had no external validation. In Haldeman&#x27;s view, those participants in the study who reported change were bisexual at the outset, and its authors wrongly interpreted capacity for heterosexual sex as change of sexual orientation.

===Reparative therapy===

The term &quot;reparative therapy&quot; has been used as a synonym for conversion therapy generally, but according to Jack Drescher it properly refers to a specific kind of therapy associated with the psychologists Elizabeth Moberly and Joseph Nicolosi. 
For example, he wrote: 
:. . . the pursuit of fulfillment through same-sex eroticism is spurred by the fearful anticipation that their masculine self-assertion will inevitably fail and result in humiliation.

The term &quot;reparative&quot; refers to Nicolosi&#x27;s postulate that same-sex attraction is a person&#x27;s unconscious attempt to &quot;self-repair&quot; feelings of inferiority.

After California banned conversion practices, Nicolosi argued that &quot;reparative therapy&quot; didn&#x27;t attempt to directly change sexual orientation but instead encourage exploration into its underlying causes, which he believed was often childhood trauma.

===Marriage therapy===

Previous editions of the World Health Organization&#x27;s ICD included &quot;sexual relationship disorder&quot;, in which a person&#x27;s sexual orientation or gender identity makes it difficult to form or maintain a relationship with a sexual partner. The belief that their sexual orientation has caused problems in their relationship may lead some people to turn to a marriage therapist for help to change their sexual orientation. Sexual orientation disorder was removed from the most recent ICD, ICD-11, after the Working Group on Sexual Disorders and Sexual Health determined that its inclusion was unjustified.

=== Gender exploratory therapy ===
Gender exploratory therapy (GET) is a form of conversion therapy characterized by requiring mandatory extended talk therapy attempting to find pathological roots for gender dysphoria while simultaneously delaying social and medical transition and viewing it as a last resort. Practitioners of GET propose their patient&#x27;s dysphoria is caused by factors such as homophobia, social contagion, sexual trauma, and autism. Some practitioners of GET avoid using their patients&#x27; chosen names and pronouns while questioning their identification. Commenting on gender exploratory therapy in 2022, bioethicist Florence Ashley argued that its framing as an undirected exploration of underlying psychological issues bore similarities to gay conversion practices such as &quot;reparative&quot; therapy. States that have banned gender-affirming care for minors in the United States have called expert witnesses to argue that exploratory therapy should be the alternative treatment.

There are no known empirical studies examining psychosocial or medical outcomes following GET. Concerns have been raised that by not providing an estimated length of time for the therapy, the delays in medical interventions may compound mental suffering in trans youth, while gender-affirming model of care already promotes gender identity exploration without favoring any particular identity, and individualized care. GET proponents deny this. 

In 2017, Richard Green published a legal strategy which called for circumventing bans on conversion therapy by labelling the practice &quot;gender identity exploration or development&quot;. Multiple groups now exist worldwide to promote GET and have been successful in influencing legal discussions and clinical guidance in some regions. The Gender Exploratory Therapy Association (GETA) asserts that &quot;psychological approaches should be the first-line treatment for all cases of gender dysphoria&quot;, that medical interventions for transgender youth are &quot;experimental and should be avoided if possible&quot;, and that social transition is &quot;risky&quot;. All of GETA&#x27;s leaders are members of Genspect, a &quot;gender-critical&quot; group that promotes GET and argues that gender-affirming care should not be available to those under 25. In late 2023, GETA changed their name to &quot;Therapy First&quot;.

GETA also shares a large overlap with the Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine (SEGM), which promotes GET as first-line treatment for those under 25. GETA co-founder Lisa Marchiano stated U.S. President Joe Biden&#x27;s executive order safeguarding trans youth from conversion therapy would have a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on GET practices. GETA also opposed Biden&#x27;s Title IX changes protecting trans students from discrimination, stating allowing trans youth in restrooms would harm the mental health of their peers. The American College of Pediatricians, a small group aligned with the Christian Right, has cited numerous studies from SEGM to claim GET is necessary to restore transgender people&#x27;s &quot;biological integrity&quot;. In November 2023, Michelle Cretella, a board member of the pro conversion therapy group Alliance for Therapeutic Choice and Scientific Integrity (ATCSI, formerly NARTH), gave a speech at an ATCSI conference which endorsed GET and argued it &quot;truly is very similar to how the Alliance has always approached unwanted same-sex attraction&quot;.

==Effects==

There is a scientific consensus that conversion therapy is ineffective at changing a person&#x27;s sexual orientation. Advocates of conversion therapy rely heavily on testimonials and retrospective self-reports as evidence of effectiveness. Studies purporting to validate the effectiveness of efforts to change sexual orientation or gender identity have been criticized for methodological flaws. After conversion therapy has failed to change someone&#x27;s sexual orientation or gender identity, participants often feel increased shame that they already felt over their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Conversion therapy can cause significant, long-term psychological harm. This includes significantly higher rates of depression, substance abuse, and other mental health issues in individuals who have undergone conversion therapy than their peers who did not, including a suicide attempt rate nearly twice that of those who did not. Modern-day practitioners of conversion therapy—primarily from a conservative religious viewpoint—disagree with current evidence-based medicine and clinical guidance that does not view homosexuality and gender variance as unnatural or unhealthy.

In 2020, ILGA World published a world survey and report &quot;Curbing Deception&quot; listing consequences and life-threatening effects by associating specific public testimonies with different types of methods used to practice conversion therapies.

A 2022 study estimated that conversion therapy of youth in the United States cost $650.16 million annually with an additional $9.5 billion in associated costs such as increased suicide and substance abuse. Youth who undergo conversion therapy from a religious provider have more negative mental health outcomes than those who had consulted a licensed healthcare provider.

==Public opinion==
A 2020 survey carried out on US adults found majority support for banning conversion therapy for minors.

A 2022 YouGov poll found majority support in England, Scotland, and Wales for a conversion therapy ban for both sexual orientation and gender identity, with opposition ranging from 13 to 15 percent.

==Legal status==
Some jurisdictions have criminal bans on the practice of conversion therapy, including Canada, Ecuador, France, Germany, Malta, Mexico and Spain. In other countries, including Albania, Brazil, Chile, Vietnam and Taiwan, medical professionals are barred from practicing conversion therapy.

In some states, lawsuits against conversion therapy providers for fraud have succeeded, but in other jurisdictions those claiming fraud must prove that the perpetrator was intentionally dishonest. Thus, a provider who genuinely believes conversion therapy is effective could not be convicted.

Conversion therapy on minors may amount to child abuse.

===Human rights===
In 2020, the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims released an official statement that conversion therapy is torture. The same year, UN Independent Expert on sexual orientation and gender identity, Victor Madrigal-Borloz, said that conversion therapy practices are &quot;inherently discriminatory, that they are cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and that depending on the severity or physical or mental pain and suffering inflicted to the victim, they may amount to torture&quot;. He recommended that it should be banned across the world. In 2021, Ilias Trispiotis and Craig Purshouse argue that conversion therapy violates the prohibition against degrading treatment under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, leading to a state obligation to prohibit it. In February 2023 Commissioner for Human Rights, Dunja Mijatović, qualified those practices as “irreconcilable with several guarantees under the European Convention on Human Rights&quot; and having no place in a human rights-based society urging the Member States of the Council of Europe to ban them for both adults and minors, later in July 2023 she advocated for clear actions during a public hearing at the European Parliament studying different approaches to legally ban &quot;conversion therapies&quot; in the European Union. In September 2024 it was reported that the European Union is considering banning &quot;conversion therapies&quot; across its Member States, while a European Citizens&#x27; Initiative that started collecting signatures in May 2024 is also calling on the European Commission to outlaw such practices.

==In media==

Efforts to change sexual orientation have been depicted and discussed in popular culture and various media. More recent examples include: &quot;Boy Erased&quot;, &quot;The Miseducation of Cameron Post&quot;, &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; musical, &quot;Ratched&quot;, and documentary features &quot;Pray Away, Homotherapy: A Religious Sickness.&quot;

==Medical views==
National health organizations around the world have uniformly denounced and criticized sexual orientation and gender identity change efforts. They state that there has been no scientific demonstration of &quot;conversion therapy&#x27;s&quot; efficacy. They find that conversion therapy is ineffective, risky and can be harmful. Anecdotal claims of cures are counterbalanced by assertions of harm, and the American Psychiatric Association, for example, cautions ethical practitioners under the Hippocratic oath to do no harm and to refrain from attempts at conversion therapy. Furthermore, they state that conversion therapy is harmful and that it often exploits individual&#x27;s guilt and anxiety, thereby damaging self-esteem and leading to depression and even suicide. There is also concern in the mental health community that the advancement of conversion therapy can cause social harm by disseminating inaccurate views about gender identity, sexual orientation, and the ability of LGBT people to lead happy, healthy lives. Various medical bodies prohibit their members from practicing conversion therapy.

<doc id="26411" wikidata="Q1194212" url="?curid=26411" title="Ring homomorphism">
<text>In mathematics, a ring homomorphism is a structure-preserving function between two rings. More explicitly, if &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are rings, then a ring homomorphism is a function formula_1 that preserves addition, multiplication and multiplicative identity; that is,
:formula_2
for all formula_3 in formula_4

These conditions imply that additive inverses and the additive identity are preserved too.

If in addition is a bijection, then its inverse −1 is also a ring homomorphism. In this case, is called a ring isomorphism, and the rings &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are called &quot;isomorphic&quot;. From the standpoint of ring theory, isomorphic rings have exactly the same properties.

If &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are rngs, then the corresponding notion is that of a rng homomorphism, defined as above except without the third condition &quot;f&quot;(1&quot;R&quot;) = 1&quot;S&quot;. A rng homomorphism between (unital) rings need not be a ring homomorphism.

The composition of two ring homomorphisms is a ring homomorphism. It follows that the rings forms a category with ring homomorphisms as morphisms (see Category of rings).
In particular, one obtains the notions of ring endomorphism, ring isomorphism, and ring automorphism.

== Properties ==
Let be a ring homomorphism. Then, directly from these definitions, one can deduce:
* &quot;f&quot;(0&quot;R&quot;) = 0&quot;S&quot;.
* &quot;f&quot;(−&quot;a&quot;) = −&quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;R&quot;.
* For any unit &quot;a&quot; in &quot;R&quot;, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) is a unit element such that . In particular, &quot;f&quot; induces a group homomorphism from the (multiplicative) group of units of &quot;R&quot; to the (multiplicative) group of units of &quot;S&quot; (or of im(&quot;f&quot;)).
* The image of &quot;f&quot;, denoted im(&quot;f&quot;), is a subring of &quot;S&quot;.
* The kernel of &quot;f&quot;, defined as , is a two-sided ideal in &quot;R&quot;. Every two-sided ideal in a ring &quot;R&quot; is the kernel of some ring homomorphism.
* A homomorphism is injective if and only if kernel is the zero ideal.
* The characteristic of &quot;S&quot; divides the characteristic of &quot;R&quot;. This can sometimes be used to show that between certain rings &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot;, no ring homomorphism exists.
* If &quot;Rp&quot; is the smallest subring contained in &quot;R&quot; and &quot;Sp&quot; is the smallest subring contained in &quot;S&quot;, then every ring homomorphism induces a ring homomorphism .
* If &quot;R&quot; is a field (or more generally a skew-field) and &quot;S&quot; is not the zero ring, then is injective.
* If both &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are fields, then im(&quot;f&quot;) is a subfield of &quot;S&quot;, so &quot;S&quot; can be viewed as a field extension of &quot;R&quot;.
* If &quot;I&quot; is an ideal of &quot;S&quot; then −1(&quot;I&quot;) is an ideal of &quot;R&quot;.
* If &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are commutative and &quot;P&quot; is a prime ideal of &quot;S&quot; then −1(&quot;P&quot;) is a prime ideal of &quot;R&quot;.
* If &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are commutative, &quot;M&quot; is a maximal ideal of &quot;S&quot;, and is surjective, then −1(&quot;M&quot;) is a maximal ideal of &quot;R&quot;.
* If &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are commutative and &quot;S&quot; is an integral domain, then ker(&quot;f&quot;) is a prime ideal of &quot;R&quot;.
* If &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are commutative, &quot;S&quot; is a field, and is surjective, then ker(&quot;f&quot;) is a maximal ideal of &quot;R&quot;.
* If is surjective, &quot;P&quot; is prime (maximal) ideal in &quot;R&quot; and , then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;P&quot;) is prime (maximal) ideal in &quot;S&quot;.

Moreover,
* The composition of ring homomorphisms and is a ring homomorphism .
* For each ring &quot;R&quot;, the identity map is a ring homomorphism.
* Therefore, the class of all rings together with ring homomorphisms forms a category, the category of rings.
* The zero map that sends every element of &quot;R&quot; to 0 is a ring homomorphism only if &quot;S&quot; is the zero ring (the ring whose only element is zero).
* For every ring &quot;R&quot;, there is a unique ring homomorphism . This says that the ring of integers is an initial object in the category of rings.
* For every ring &quot;R&quot;, there is a unique ring homomorphism from &quot;R&quot; to the zero ring. This says that the zero ring is a terminal object in the category of rings.
* As the initial object is not isomorphic to the terminal object, there is no zero object in the category of rings; in particular, the zero ring is not a zero object in the category of rings.

== Examples ==
* The function , defined by is a surjective ring homomorphism with kernel &quot;n&quot;Z (see modular arithmetic).
* The complex conjugation is a ring homomorphism (this is an example of a ring automorphism).
* For a ring &quot;R&quot; of prime characteristic &quot;p&quot;, is a ring endomorphism called the Frobenius endomorphism.
* If &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are rings, the zero function from &quot;R&quot; to &quot;S&quot; is a ring homomorphism if and only if &quot;S&quot; is the zero ring (otherwise it fails to map 1&quot;R&quot; to 1&quot;S&quot;). On the other hand, the zero function is always a rng homomorphism.
* If R[&quot;X&quot;] denotes the ring of all polynomials in the variable &quot;X&quot; with coefficients in the real numbers R, and C denotes the complex numbers, then the function defined by (substitute the imaginary unit &quot;i&quot; for the variable &quot;X&quot; in the polynomial &quot;p&quot;) is a surjective ring homomorphism. The kernel of &quot;f&quot; consists of all polynomials in R[&quot;X&quot;] that are divisible by .
* If is a ring homomorphism between the rings &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot;, then &quot;f&quot; induces a ring homomorphism between the matrix rings .
* Let &quot;V&quot; be a vector space over a field &quot;k&quot;. Then the map given by is a ring homomorphism. More generally, given an abelian group &quot;M&quot;, a module structure on &quot;M&quot; over a ring &quot;R&quot; is equivalent to giving a ring homomorphism .
* A unital algebra homomorphism between unital associative algebras over a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; is a ring homomorphism that is also &quot;R&quot;-linear.

== Non-examples ==
* The function defined by is a ring homomorphism (and ring endomorphism), with kernel 3Z/6Z and image 2Z/6Z (which is isomorphic to Z/3Z).
* There is no ring homomorphism for any .
* If &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are rings, the inclusion that sends each &quot;r&quot; to (&quot;r&quot;,0) is a rng homomorphism, but not a ring homomorphism (if &quot;S&quot; is not the zero ring), since it does not map the multiplicative identity 1 of &quot;R&quot; to the multiplicative identity (1,1) of .

== Category of rings ==
=== Endomorphisms, isomorphisms, and automorphisms ===
* A ring endomorphism is a ring homomorphism from a ring to itself.
* A ring isomorphism is a ring homomorphism having a 2-sided inverse that is also a ring homomorphism. One can prove that a ring homomorphism is an isomorphism if and only if it is bijective as a function on the underlying sets. If there exists a ring isomorphism between two rings &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot;, then &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are called isomorphic. Isomorphic rings differ only by a relabeling of elements. Example: Up to isomorphism, there are four rings of order 4. (This means that there are four pairwise non-isomorphic rings of order 4 such that every other ring of order 4 is isomorphic to one of them.) On the other hand, up to isomorphism, there are eleven rngs of order 4.
* A ring automorphism is a ring isomorphism from a ring to itself.

=== Monomorphisms and epimorphisms ===
Injective ring homomorphisms are identical to monomorphisms in the category of rings: If is a monomorphism that is not injective, then it sends some &quot;r&quot;1 and &quot;r&quot;2 to the same element of &quot;S&quot;. Consider the two maps &quot;g&quot;1 and &quot;g&quot;2 from Z[&quot;x&quot;] to &quot;R&quot; that map &quot;x&quot; to &quot;r&quot;1 and &quot;r&quot;2, respectively; and are identical, but since is a monomorphism this is impossible.

However, surjective ring homomorphisms are vastly different from epimorphisms in the category of rings. For example, the inclusion is a ring epimorphism, but not a surjection. However, they are exactly the same as the strong epimorphisms.

<doc id="26413" wikidata="Q8682" url="?curid=26413" title="Real Madrid CF">
<text>Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (), commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid. The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football.

Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title &quot;real&quot; is Spanish for &quot;royal&quot; and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 along with the crown in the club crest. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 85,000-capacity Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting clubs, Real Madrid&#x27;s members (&quot;socios&quot;) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the &quot;Hala Madrid y nada más&quot;, written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois. The club is one of the most widely supported in the world and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2024. It was estimated to be worth $6.6 billion in 2024, making it the world&#x27;s most valuable football club. In 2024, Real Madrid became the first football club to make €1 billion ($1.08bn) in revenue according to the club&#x27;s announcement.

Real Madrid are one of the most successful football clubs in the world and most successful in Europe. In domestic football, the club has won 71 trophies; a record 36 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga. In International football, Real Madrid have won a record 35 trophies: a record 15 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a record six UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record nine FIFA Club World championships. Madrid was ranked joint first a record number of times in the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics Club World Ranking for the years 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017, and 2024. In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.

Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid has many long-standing rivalries, most notably &quot;El Clásico&quot; with Barcelona and &quot;El Derbi Madrileño&quot; with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered, by some in the sport, to be the greatest of all time. Real Madrid is known for its &quot;Galácticos&quot; policy, which involves signing the world&#x27;s best players, such as Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team. The term &#x27;Galácticos policy&#x27; generally refers to the two eras of Florentino Pérez&#x27;s presidency of the club (2000–2006 and 2009–2018); however, players brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the &quot;Galácticos&quot; legacy. A notable example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also succeeded under the policy. On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record-breaking £80 million (€94 million); he became both the club&#x27;s and history&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer. Madrid have recently relaxed the Galácticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo, Jude Bellingham and Kylian Mbappé.

Real Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS, while also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004. Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (55), a tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored. Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (&quot;three-peat&quot;) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18 and was the first and the only club to win La Decima (in 2013–14). In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the sixth in eleven seasons), recognised as such by Guinness World Records. Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe&#x27;s top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions. Real Madrid are ranked 1st in the UEFA club rankings as well as first in last 10 years (2013–2023) overall.

==History==

===Early years (1902–1943)===

Real Madrid&#x27;s origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the &quot;Institución Libre de Enseñanza&quot;, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates. They founded &quot;(Sociedad) Sky Football&quot; in 1897, commonly known as &quot;La Sociedad&quot; (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. 

In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, &quot;Nueva Sociedad de Football&quot; (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from &quot;Sky Football&quot;. Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, &quot;Sky&quot; was renamed as &quot;New Foot-Ball Club&quot;. 

On 6 March 1902, after a new board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded. The Padrós brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of &quot;Al Capricho&quot;, the family business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white in honour of a famous English team Corinthian, which Juan Padrós had met on one of his trips.
Three years after its founding, in 1905, &quot;Madrid FC&quot; won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the &quot;Campo de O&#x27;Donnell&quot; in 1912. In 1920, the club&#x27;s name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.

In 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona. Real Madrid won its first league title in the 1931–32 season and retained it the following year.

On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and the royal crown on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943, Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of the Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals, the Spanish Cup having been renamed in honour of General Franco. 

The first leg, played at the Les Corts in Catalonia, had ended with Barcelona winning 3–0. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fernández had allowed for Barcelona, with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. The newspaper &quot;Ya&quot; reported the whistling as a &quot;clear intention to attack the representatives of Spain.&quot; Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel. 

Barcelona&#x27;s striker Mariano Gonzalvo said of the incident, &quot;Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins.&quot; Barcelona goalkeeper Luis Miró rarely approached his line—when he did, he was armed with stones. As Francisco Calvet told the story, &quot;They were shouting: &quot;Reds! Separatists!&quot;... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up.&quot;

Real Madrid went 2–0 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona&#x27;s Benito García after he made what Calvet claimed was a &quot;completely normal tackle&quot;. Madrid&#x27;s José Llopis Corona recalled: &quot;At which point, they got a bit demoralized,&quot; while Ángel Mur countered, &quot;at which point, we thought: &#x27;go on then, score as many as you want&#x27;.&quot; Madrid made it 8–0 by half-time; two goals were also ruled out for offside, and proceeded to score a further three goals in the second half, to which Barcelona replied with a late consolation goal. 

According to football writer Sid Lowe, &quot;There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona&#x27;s history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.&quot; Fernando Argila, Barcelona&#x27;s reserve goalkeeper from the 1943 match, said: &quot;There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game.&quot;

===Santiago Bernabéu and unprecedented success (1943–1978)===

Santiago Bernabéu became president of Real Madrid in 1943. Under his presidency, the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the club&#x27;s current stadium, Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (now known as the Santiago Bernabéu), and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva. Additionally, during the 1950s former &quot;Real Madrid Amateurs&quot; player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid&#x27;s youth academy, or &quot;&quot;cantera&quot;,&quot; known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stéfano.
In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;, Bernabéu, Ernest Bedrignan (deputy chairman of the Ligue de Football Professionnel) and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League. It was under Bernabéu&#x27;s guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960. After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour. Real Madrid&#x27;s achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times.

The club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966, defeating Partizan Belgrade 2–1 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition. This team became known as the Yé-yé. The name &quot;Yé-yé&quot; came from the &quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah&quot; chorus in The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;She Loves You&quot; after four members of the team posed for &quot;Marca&quot; and impersonated the Beatles. The Yé-yé generation was also European Cup runners-up in 1962 and 1964. In the 1970s, Real Madrid won six league championships and three Spanish Cups. The club competed in its first European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1970–71 and progressed all the way to the final, where it lost to English side Chelsea 2–1 in a replay. On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honour him during the tournament. The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu in memory of its former president.

Bernabéu had been Real Madrid&#x27;s president for almost 35 years, during which his club won one Intercontinental Cup, six European Cups, 16 league titles, six Spanish Cups, two Latin Cups and one Copa Eva Duarte.
===Quinta del Buitre and sustained success (1980–2000)===

In the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the La Liga title, until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club. Spanish sports journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name &quot;La Quinta del Buitre&quot; (&quot;Vulture&#x27;s Cohort&quot;), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza. All five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid&#x27;s youth academy. With &quot;La Quinta del Buitre&quot; (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán &quot;Chendo&quot; and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish Cup, and three Spanish Super Cups. In the early 1990s, &quot;La Quinta del Buitre&quot; split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club.

In 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach. Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions, and players like Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker, Clarence Seedorf, Roberto Carlos and keeper Bodo Illgner, arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final with a goal from Mijatović.

In November 1999, Vicente del Bosque took over as coach. For the last season of the century, 1999–2000, the squad was still led by the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro, Fernando Redondo, Roberto Carlos and Raúl. Real added the budding young talents of Guti and Iker Casillas, supported by the arrival of Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents Míchel Salgado and Iván Helguera. In Del Bosque&#x27;s first season in charge, Real won the Champions League for the eighth time, following a 3–0 victory over Valencia in the final, with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl. This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid&#x27;s history.

===Florentino Pérez era (2000–2006)===
In July 2000, Florentino Pérez was elected club president. He vowed in his campaign to erase the club&#x27;s €270 million debt and modernize the club&#x27;s facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona. The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the &quot;Galácticos&quot; team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro. It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons. Off the pitch, the &quot;Zidanes y Pavones&quot; policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club&#x27;s high marketing potential around the world, particularly in Asia.
The few days after the capturing of the 2003 La Liga title were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Pérez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque. Over a dozen players left the club, including Madrid captain Fernando Hierro, while defensive midfielder Claude Makélélé refused to take part in training in protest at being one of the lowest-paid players at the club and subsequently moved to Chelsea. &quot;That&#x27;s a lot [of players leaving] when the normal rule is: never change a winning team,&quot; stated Zidane. Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over Real Betis.

The 2005–06 season began with the promise of several new signings: Júlio Baptista (€24 million), Robinho (€30 million), and Sergio Ramos (€27 million). However, Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005. Madrid&#x27;s coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ramón López Caro. A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after Madrid lost the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals 6–1 to Real Zaragoza, a defeat that was nearly reversed with a 4–0 home victory. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned.

===Ramón Calderón era (2006–2009)===
Ramón Calderón was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the first time in four years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked at the end of the campaign. The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona. However, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003. Real Madrid repeated as league winners in 2007–08, but the following season ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club&#x27;s history: Real was knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to Liverpool 0–5 on aggregate, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu with a humiliating 2–6 loss, which all but confirmed the league title for Barça that went on to win the treble.

===Second Florentino Pérez era (2009–present)===

On 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid&#x27;s presidency amid the outrage over the club&#x27;s decline. Pérez continued with the &quot;Galácticos&quot; policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of £56 million, and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for £80 million. Real Madrid spent in excess of €261 million in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the &quot;Second Galácticos&quot;. The 2009–10 season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club&#x27;s record at the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon. The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo&#x27;s injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks, although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals. Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe&#x27;s top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool&#x27;s 97 points in 2018–19.

José Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010. In the 2010–11 season, the rebuilt Madrid successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a brilliant Barcelona side which some regard as the greatest team in football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the league, with 92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the Copa del Rey final, and lost to Barça in the Champions League semi-finals, where Real progressed to for the first time since 2002–03. Moreover, from 16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four &quot;Clásicos&quot; were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey final (which was won by Madrid 1–0 a.e.t., bringing them their first trophy in the second &quot;Galáctico&quot; era) on 20 April and the third and fourth ones in the controversial two-legged Champions League semi-finals on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2–0 away victory and a 1–1 home draw). Madrid again became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season, with Ronaldo scoring 40 and winning the European Golden Shoe.

In the 2011–12 season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in its history, also finishing the season with numerous league records set, including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins overall. They also competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 15th successive season, losing in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich in a penalty shoot-out after a 3–3 aggregate tie. Madrid entered the Copa del Rey as the defending champions, but lost 3–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Puskás, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.

Real Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the &quot;Blaugrana&quot; six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million. After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by &quot;mutual agreement&quot;.

====&quot;La Décima&quot; and Champions League dominance====
On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants. On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million. In Ancelotti&#x27;s first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals. By that time, &quot;Los Blancos&quot; had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner. The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals. In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as &quot;La Décima&quot; (Spanish: &quot;The Tenth,&quot; ). Real&#x27;s attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals.

After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez. In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club&#x27;s 79th official trophy. During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season&#x27;s successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, &quot;If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,&quot; while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, &quot;We must start again from zero.&quot;

After a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard&#x27;s Barça in the 2005–06 season. In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final. The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins. Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals. Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012. Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals, several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015.

On 3 June 2015, Rafael Benítez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager for the 2015–16 season, signing a three-year contract. Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league until a 3–2 loss at Sevilla on the matchday 11. This was followed by a 0–4 home loss in the first &quot;Clásico&quot; of the season against Barcelona. Perhaps, his reign is best remembered by multiple lopsided wins achieved both in La Liga and the Champions League (6–0 vs Espanyol, 8–0 vs Malmö, 10–2 vs Rayo Vallecano and others). In the Copa del Rey round of 32, Real accidentally fielded an ineligible player in a 3–1 first leg win at Cádiz and was disqualified from the tournament two days later by the competition judge, despite protests from president Pérez. In the meantime, Madrid comfortably topped their UCL group with 16 points and a +16 goal difference. Benítez was relieved of his duties on 4 January 2016 following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to produce good results against top teams. Benítez&#x27;s departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role. Under Zidane, Madrid managed to turn the odds in its favour, ultimately winning the Champions League, something no one expected. The notable results include a 2–1 away victory over reigning treble winners Barcelona, who were on a record-breaking winning streak, a fantastic comeback against Wolfsburg in the Champions League quarter-finals (after losing the away game 0–2, Madrid erased the deficit and won 3–0 at home, courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick), as well as a 12-game winning streak to conclude the league campaign, meaning Real finished second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona, coming agonizingly close to clinching the title and overcoming a 12-point deficit in the process. Finally, on 28 May, Real Madrid&#x27;s eleventh Champions League title was won thanks to a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over rivals Atlético Madrid after a 1–1 draw in the final, with the achievement being termed &quot;La Undécima&quot;.
Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane&#x27;s first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla. On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record. On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup. With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona&#x27;s Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season. Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later. The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process. On 3 June 2017, the club&#x27;s victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup. Real Madrid&#x27;s title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as &quot;La Duodécima&quot;. The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season.

Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United. Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in &quot;El Clásico&quot; matches and winning the second trophy of the season. On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy. In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid&#x27;s fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club&#x27;s &quot;need for change&quot; as his rationale for departing. Zidane&#x27;s and Ronaldo&#x27;s departures marked the end of the &quot;Second Galáctico Era&quot; that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona&#x27;s dominance, despite the &quot;Blaugrana&quot; boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history, and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage. Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners.

====Following Ronaldo&#x27;s departure====

On 12 June 2018, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spanish national team, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them. The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million. Madrid began their 2018–19 campaign by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 a.e.t. in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. After a 1–5 loss to Barcelona in &quot;El Clásico&quot; on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari. On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain 4–1 in the FIFA Club World Cup and became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles. However, they were then knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 1–4 on aggregate. On 5 March 2019, Real was defeated by Ajax 1–4 (3–5 on aggregate) at home, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances. On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club. Madrid finished the season with 68 points and a +17 goal difference, its lowest totals since 2001–02 and 1999–2000 respectively.

In the summer of 2019, Madrid signed Eden Hazard, Luka Jović, Éder Militão, Ferland Mendy, Rodrygo, Reinier and other players for a total of more than €350 million. On 12 January 2020, Madrid beat cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid in a penalty shootout in the Supercopa de España final to win their eleventh title. After a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, La Liga was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team&#x27;s 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total. From the competition&#x27;s resumption in June and until the end of the 2020–21 season, Real temporarily played home fixtures at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, while the Santiago Bernabéu underwent extensive renovations.

====Further domestic success and &quot;La Decimocuarta&quot;====
Zidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless that season, with Carlo Ancelotti returning to coach the team for the 2021–22 season. On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de España. As such, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid. In the Champions League, Madrid produced one of the most memorable runs of all time, defeating pre-tournament favourites Paris Saint-Germain, defending champions and favourites Chelsea, Premier League champions and heavy favourites Manchester City, all in dramatic fashion, and setting up the final against Liverpool, who were once again widely considered as favourites, in a rematch of their 2018 encounter. A lone Vinícius Júnior goal sealed the 14th European Cup for &quot;Los Blancos&quot;, their fifth in nine years, and Ancelotti&#x27;s second in charge. Real also claimed their fourth ever European double (after 1956–57, 1957–58, and 2016–17). Despite Real&#x27;s status as the most decorated team in the history of the Champions League, they were not favoured to win that year&#x27;s edition, and their improbable run was widely considered a surprise.

====Even more success and &quot;La Decimoquinta&quot;====
After a highly successful 2021–22 season, Real Madrid signed German defender Antonio Rüdiger and French midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni, while club legends Marcelo, Isco, Gareth Bale and Casemiro left the club. Real Madrid&#x27;s 2022–23 season began with lifting the UEFA Super Cup and later the FIFA Club World Cup. The season ended with Real Madrid winning the 2022–23 Copa del Rey, but losing the La Liga and Spanish Super Cup to FC Barcelona and the Champions League to Manchester City, being defeated 5–1 on aggregate.

In 2023, Real Madrid signed Jude Bellingham, who was given the number #5 jersey, previously used by Zinedine Zidane. Real also signed Arda Güler and Fran García. Meanwhile, Vinícius Júnior was given the number #7 jersey, previously used by Raúl and Cristiano Ronaldo; while Rodrygo was given the number #11 jersey, previously used by Gareth Bale. Karim Benzema left the club, while Toni Kroos would later announce that he would retire from football after this season.

The 2023–24 season would prove to be another highly successful season for Los Blancos. First, Real Madrid lifted the Spanish Super Cup against Barcelona 4–1, taking revenge of the previous year&#x27;s 3–0 defeat. Then, Real Madrid lifted the La Liga with relative ease, reaching 95 points, the second-best winning campaign by Real Madrid in La Liga history after the 2011–12 100 points season. In the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid knocked out RB Leipzig in the Round of 16, then defending champions Manchester City in penalties.

In the semifinals, Real Madrid faced Bayern Munich again. The first match was a 2–2 draw, while the second match in the Bernabéu was marked by a double by Joselu in the last few minutes of the game, with Bayern Munich suffering a historic comeback after leading 1–0. Real Madrid faced Borussia Dortmund in the final, and won 2–0, with Dani Carvajal being the man of the match and scoring with a header after a Toni Kroos corner, and Vinícius Júnior once again scoring in a UCL final. Real Madrid won their 15th Champions League without losing a single match during the campaign. 

Following the conclusion of the 2023–24 season, Real Madrid announced that striker Kylian Mbappé would be joining the club on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain in July 2024, concluding one of the most highly anticipated transfer sagas in modern history. On 18 December 2024, Real Madrid clinched their second trophy of the season, uplifting the inaugural 2024 FIFA Intercontinental Cup by beating Pachuca 3–0.

==Crests and colours==
===Crests===

The first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, &quot;MCF&quot; for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt.
The first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle. The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title &quot;Real Madrid,&quot; meaning &quot;Royal.&quot; Thus, Alfonso&#x27;s crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself &quot;Real Madrid Club de Fútbol&quot;.

With the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile. In 1941, two years after Nationalist victory in the Civil War, the Francoist regime restored the crest&#x27;s &quot;Real Corona&quot;, or &quot;Royal Crown&quot;, while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well. In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club went back to its honorific name &quot;Real Madrid Club de Fútbol&quot;. The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.

===Colours===

Real Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, one season in 1926 that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Juan Padrós in honour of an English team Corinthian, which he had met on one of his trips, one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship. It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, which had also inspired Madrid&#x27;s original white kit, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the 1926 Copa del Rey by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck. By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club&#x27;s crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts. English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.

Real&#x27;s traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club&#x27;s kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998. Real Madrid&#x27;s first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992. In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club&#x27;s website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club&#x27;s shirt. Real Madrid&#x27;s shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens. Fly Emirates became their shirt sponsor in 2013, and in 2017 the club renewed the sponsorship with the airliner, signing a deal until 2022 worth €70 million per year. In 2022, the agreement was again extended, until 2026. In 2015, Madrid signed a new ten-year contract with Adidas, believed to be worth a total of £850 million (€1 billion), with the club earning £59 million (€64 million) per season. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime, if Real Madrid fails to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.

&quot;Note: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team&#x27;s performance.&quot;

==Grounds==

After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O&#x27;Donnell in 1912, which remained its home stadium for 11 years. After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators. After that, Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the Estadio Chamartín, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United. In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title. Following his election in 1943, president Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and inaugurated on 14 December 1947. Initially knows as &quot;Nuevo Chamartín&quot;, the stadium was renamed in honour of Bernabéu in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day. The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses, with &quot;Los Blancos&quot; winning 3–1 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal.

The capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion. Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing areas were removed in 1998–99 in response to UEFA regulations which had forbidden standing at matches in European competitions), countered to some extent by expansions. The current capacity is 81,044 spectators. Real Madrid has the fourth-highest average attendance in Europe, behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.

The Bernabéu has hosted the 1964 UEFA European Championship final, the 1982 FIFA World Cup final, and the 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 European Cup/Champions League finals. The stadium has its own namesake Madrid Metro station along the 10 line. On 14 November 2007, the Bernabéu was upgraded to Elite Football Stadium status by UEFA.

On 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, named after club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano, was inaugurated in the Real Madrid City, where Real Madrid usually trains. The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and Reims, a rematch of the 1956 European Cup final. Real Madrid 6–1, with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2) and José Manuel Jurado. The venue is now part of the Ciudad Real Madrid, the club&#x27;s training facility located outside Madrid, in Valdebebas. The stadium&#x27;s capacity is 5,000 people, and it is Real Madrid Castilla&#x27;s home ground. For the latter part of the 2019–20 season and throughout the 2020–21 season, the stadium hosted the first team&#x27;s home games due to a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic-triggered restrictions and an extensive renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu.

The latest renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu is set to increase the capacity by approximately 4,000 with the addition of an extra tier, bringing it to nearly 85,000. Furthermore, the height will also be increased by ten metres and a retractable roof, a retractable pitch and a 360-degree screen will be installed. The works have started in 2019, and the renovated stadium was initially planned to be unveiled in 2022; however, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine caused significant disruption to supply chains, prompting the club to postpone the stadium&#x27;s inauguration to 2023.

==Records and statistics==

Raúl holds the record for most appearances with Real Madrid, with 741  appearances from 1994 to 2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis Jr., having played 710 times. The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances. With 63 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored the most international goals while playing for the club. Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos has accumulated the most caps while playing for the club, with 176.
Cristiano Ronaldo (2009–2018) is Real Madrid&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches. Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–1964), Santillana (1971–1988), Ferenc Puskás (1958–1966), Hugo Sánchez (1985–1992), Karim Benzema (2009–2023) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994–2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014–15), alongside being Real&#x27;s top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 311 goals. Di Stéfano&#x27;s 49 goals in 58 matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals for Madrid and 140 overall. The fastest goal in the history of the club (13 seconds) was scored by the Chilean Iván Zamorano on 3 September 1994 during a league match against Sevilla.

Officially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 129,690, which was for a European Cup match in 1956 against Milan. The current official capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu is 80,000. Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (36 as of 2023–24) and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 1960–65 and 1985–90). With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga.
The club also holds the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League fifteen times and for the most semi-finals appearances (33). As of June 2024, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 140 (141 including qualifiers) goals in total, 105 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955–56 to 1969–70. Among the club&#x27;s on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014–15 season, a Spanish record. In September 2017, the club equalled the record of the Brazilian club Santos, starring Pelé, by scoring in their 73rd consecutive game, before Bayern Munich breaks the record in 2021.

In June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history of football after purchasing Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo for €94 million (£80 million). The fee of €77.5 million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane&#x27;s transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pounds sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan for €67 million (£65 million). The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur&#x27;s Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer fee approximated at around €100 million. In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale&#x27;s transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of €100,759,418. Real Madrid equalled their record signing in 2019, when the club signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea for a reported €115 million. The club&#x27;s record sale occurred on 10 July 2018, when Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo for €117 million.

==Support==

During most home matches, the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season-ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000. To become a season ticket holder one must first be a &quot;socio&quot;, or club member. In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800 &quot;peñas&quot; (official, club-affiliated supporters&#x27; groups) in Spain and around the world. Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernabéu. One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017.

Real Madrid&#x27;s hardcore supporters are the so-called &quot;Ultras Sur&quot; supporters, or simply Ultras. They are known for their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona&#x27;s hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio &quot;Irriducibili&quot; fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players, and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so. Florentino Pérez took it upon himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result. The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.

Questioned over Pope Francis&#x27; adherence to 2014 FIFA Club World Cup Final opponents San Lorenzo, Madrid captain Sergio Ramos stated: &quot;In the semi-finals we noticed the love from supporters in Marrakesh and it seemed like we were playing at home. That sums up the greatness of this team. Madrid is God&#x27;s team and the team of the world&quot;. Among the club&#x27;s famous supporters is golfer Sergio García, who was invited to take the honorary kickoff for El Clásico at the Bernabeu wearing his green jacket from winning the 2017 Masters.

==Rivalries==
===El Clásico===
There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as &quot;The Classic&quot; (&quot;El Clásico&quot;). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War. Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 105 victories for Madrid, 101 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws as of December 2024.
As early as the 1930s, Barcelona &quot;had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid&quot;. During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to Franco&#x27;s regime. In that period, Barcelona gained their motto &quot;Més que un club&quot; (&quot;English: More than a club&quot;) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.

There is an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco&#x27;s rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree that Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its &quot;royal&quot; name after the fall of the Republic and again became Real Madrid). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed Barcelona succeed as &quot;Spanish team&quot;, rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco&#x27;s rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid&#x27;s 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid, despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu&#x27;s &quot;revolution&quot; that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco&#x27;s forces, saw Real Madrid on top, not only of Spanish, but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe&#x27;s best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles, but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s. These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco&#x27;s attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime&#x27;s international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as minister of foreign affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that &quot;[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had&quot;. Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, six Copa del Generalísimo titles, one Copa Eva Duarte, six European Cups, two Latin Cups and one Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won eight league titles, nine Copa del Generalísimo titles, three Copa Eva Duarte titles, three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups and two Latin Cups.

The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millonarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players&#x27; strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios&#x27; return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano&#x27;s rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to &quot;Los Blancos&quot;, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.

Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup. The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. Ahead of the 1973–74 season, Johan Cruyff arrived to Barcelona for a world record £920,000 from Ajax. Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son &quot;Jordi&quot;, after the local Catalan Saint George. In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the &quot;Match of The Century&quot; by Spanish media, and Madrid&#x27;s win was watched by more than 500 million people around the world. A fixture known for its intensity and indiscipline, it has also featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, often involving mocking the opposition. In October 1999, Real Madrid forward Raúl silenced 100,000 Barcelona fans at the Camp Nou when he scored before he celebrated by putting a finger to his lips as if telling the crowd to be quiet. In 2009, Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of Madrid fans at the Bernabéu. Cristiano Ronaldo twice gestured to the hostile crowd to &quot;calm down&quot; after scoring against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 2012 and 2016. In April 2017, Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them. Later that year, in August, Ronaldo was subbed on in the first leg of the Supercopa de España, proceeded to score in the 80th minute and took his shirt off before holding it up to Barça&#x27;s fans with his name and number facing them.

===El Derbi madrileño===
The club&#x27;s nearest neighbour is Atlético Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atlético was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of &quot;Madrid FC&quot;. The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the regional championship, with Real Madrid winning 2–1. Their first league meeting came on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first league championship at the former Chamartín. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2–1. After the Civil War, during the early Francoist period, Atlético became associated with the military air force (and thus renamed Atlético Aviación), although the alleged preference of the regime for the club is subject to discussion. In any case, during this period Atlético became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the 1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid&#x27;s multiple European Cup titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, &quot;Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we&#x27;ve ever had.&quot; Thus, Atlético fans regularly chanted that Real were &quot;El equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país&quot; – &quot;The team of the government, the shame of the country&quot; – and allegedly adopted a more left-wing slant (tempered by the rise of ultras culture and Rayo Vallecano&#x27;s presence as the &quot;true&quot; leftist club in Madrid).

The rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the European Cup when the two clubs met in the semi-finals. Real won the first leg 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu, while Atlético won 1–0 at the Metropolitano. The tie went to a replay, which Real won 2–1. Atlético, however, gained some revenge when, led by former Real Madrid coach José Villalonga, it defeated its city rivals in two successive Copa del Generalísimo finals in 1960 and 1961. In the 1970s, Atlético again took the lead as the most successful Spanish club of the decade, which prompted the Real Madrid fanbase to look down on Atlético calling them and their supporters &quot;Indios&quot; (Indians, a reference to the Latin American players signed by the Red-and-whites). By then, Real Madrid did not want to sign non-Caucasian players (president Santiago Bernabéu even stated, when he decided not to sign Portuguese star Eusebio at the end of the 1960s, &quot;Mientras yo viva, aquí no jugará ningún negro ni un blanco con bigote&quot; (&quot;As long as I live, no black or white with a mustache will play here&quot;). Atlético&#x27;s supporters accepted the new &quot;Indian&quot; nickname joyfully and have been using it until today. The Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid&#x27;s stadium, is alongside banks and businesses on the upper class Paseo de la Castellana street, while the Vicente Calderón (the stadium that Atlético Madrid used until the 2016–17 season) could be found near a brewery, alongside the Manzanares River and a motorway. Real draw greater support all across the region because of their historically greater resources and success, while Atlético have a relatively working class fan base mainly from the south of the city, with some fans also scattered throughout the city. In fact, the Atlético crest includes the Coat of arms of Madrid, whereas Real crest has no such a reference to the city (instead, it includes a reference to the broader Castile region).

Between 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atlético offered it any serious challenge, winning league titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years. Real Madrid&#x27;s record against Atlético in more recent times has been favourable. A high point came in the 2002–03 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 4–0 victory at the Vicente Calderón. Atlético&#x27;s first win over its city rivals since 1999 came in the Copa del Rey final in May 2013. In 2013–14, Real and Atlético were finalists of the UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from the same city. Real Madrid triumphed with a 4–1 comeback victory in extra time. On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calderón, a 4–0 loss. On 28 May 2016, Real and Atlético again met for the Champions League title, which resulted in a win for Real after a penalty shootout at San Siro.

===El Viejo Clásico===
A further minor rivalry exists between Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. This is known as El Viejo Clásico (&quot;the old classic&quot;), so named as the two clubs were dominant in the first half of the 20th century, meeting in nine Copa del Rey finals including the first in 1903. Until 10 December 2011, this fixture was the most played in the history of Spanish football, when it was surpassed by &quot;El Clásico&quot;.

Athletic Bilbao, who operate a policy of only using local players, have long since ceased to be a competitive rival to clubs such as Real Madrid who scour the globe for the best talent; the &quot;Lions&quot; won only two of the 26 matches between the teams from 2005–06 to 2016–17. However, the matches remain keenly fought due to their historical and cultural significance, with some parallels to the political aspect of the Barcelona/Catalonia rivalry as Athletic are the largest club in the Basque region.

===European rivalries===
====Bayern Munich====
Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning 15 times and Bayern winning six times. Although they have never met in a final, Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches (twelve wins for Madrid, eleven wins for Bayern, with three draws), with several controversial incidents occurring due to the great importance of most of their meetings. Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the &quot;Bestia negra&quot; (&quot;Black Beast&quot;).

During the 2010s, the two teams met in the 2011–12 Champions League semi-finals, which ended 3–3 on aggregate (Bayern won 3–1 on penalties after extra time, but lost the final at their own stadium by the same method), then at the same stage in the 2013–14 edition with Real Madrid winning 5–0 on aggregate, and again in 2017–18 with the Spanish club progressing 4–3; both times they went on to win the competition.

====Juventus====
Another match that is often played in the European Cup/Champions League is Real Madrid vs Juventus, the most decorated Italian club. They have played each other in 21 matches and have an almost perfectly balanced record (nine wins for Juventus, ten wins for Real Madrid and two draws), as well as nearly the same goal difference (Madrid ahead 26 to 25).
Their first meeting was in the quarter-finals of the 1961–62 European Cup, which Real Madrid won 3–1 in a replay held in Paris. At the quarter-final stage in 1995–96, Juventus prevailed 2–1 over the two legs and went on to lift the trophy. In the 1998 UEFA Champions League Final between the teams in Amsterdam, Real Madrid won 1–0. They met again in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, when both clubs were in their respective &#x27;golden eras&#x27;; Juventus won 4–3 on aggregate. By that time, star midfielder Zinedine Zidane, who played for the &quot;Bianconeri&quot; in the 1998 final, had moved from Turin to Madrid in a world record €77 million deal.

The teams met again in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage, with Madrid winning 2–1 at home and drawing 2–2 away en route to their tenth title. In the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, former Real Madrid player Álvaro Morata scored one goal in each leg to take Juventus to the final, winning 3–2 on aggregate, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored both goals for Madrid. They faced off again in the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final in Cardiff, with Ronaldo scoring twice as Real Madrid won 4–1.

The latest Champions League meeting was in the 2017–18 quarter-finals, which Real Madrid won 4–3 on aggregate; the tie ended in dramatic and controversial fashion, with a debatable penalty awarded to Real Madrid in the last minute of the second leg after Juventus built a 3–0 lead at the Bernabeu to pull level in the tie following a defeat at the Allianz Stadium by the same scoreline. Cristiano Ronaldo scored three goals over the two matches including the decisive penalty and a spectacular overhead kick, and having won the Champions League with Madrid for a fourth time, he transferred to Juventus a few months later for a €117 million fee.

==Finances and ownership==
It was under Florentino Pérez&#x27;s first presidency (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world&#x27;s richest professional football club. The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club&#x27;s debts, paving the way for it to buy the world&#x27;s most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site. The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy.

The sale of the training ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid&#x27;s debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city&#x27;s outskirts. Although Pérez&#x27;s policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club&#x27;s high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.

By September 2007, Real Madrid was considered the most valuable football brand in Europe by BBDO. In 2008, it was ranked the second-most valuable club in world football, at €951 million (£640 million / $1.285 billion), only beaten by Manchester United, which was valued at €1.333 billion (£900 million). In 2010, Real Madrid had the highest turnover in football worldwide. In September 2009, Real Madrid&#x27;s management announced plans to open the club&#x27;s own dedicated theme park by 2013.

A study at Harvard University concluded that Real Madrid &quot;is one of the 20 most important brand names and the only one in which its executives, the players, are well-known. We have some spectacular figures in regard to worldwide support of the club. There are an estimated 287 million people worldwide who follow Real Madrid.&quot; In 2010, &quot;Forbes&quot; evaluated Real Madrid&#x27;s worth to be around €992 million (US$1.323 billion), ranking them second only to Manchester United, based on figures from the 2008–09 season. According to Deloitte, Real Madrid had a recorded revenue of €401 million in the same period, ranking first.

Along with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is organised as a registered association. This means that the club is owned by its supporters, who elect the president. The president cannot invest his own money, and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through sponsorships, commercial partnerships, merchandise sales, television rights, prize money and ticket sales. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only a membership. The members of Real Madrid, called &quot;socios&quot;, form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club. As of 2010, the club had 60,000 &quot;socios&quot;. At the end of the 2009–10 season, the club&#x27;s board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of €244.6 million, €82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of €170 million after the 2010–11 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of €190 million.

During the 2009–10 season, Real Madrid made €150 million through ticket sales, the most of any club in top-flight football. Real Madrid has the highest number of shirt sales per season, around 1.5 million. For the 2010–11 season, Madrid&#x27;s wage bill totalled €169 million, which was second-highest in Europe behind Barcelona; furthermore, its wage bill to turnover ratio was the best in Europe at 43 percent, ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal at 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In 2013, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed the club as the world&#x27;s most valuable sports team, worth $3.3 billion. Real Madrid was valued at €3.47 billion ($4.1 billion) in 2018, and in the 2016–17 season it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €674.6 million. In November 2018, the average first-team pay at Madrid was £8.1m ($10.6m) per year, making it the second-highest paid sports team in the world after Barcelona. In 2022, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed Real Madrid as the most valuable football club in the world, at $5.1 billion.

==Popular culture==
Real Madrid was the featured club in the second installment of the &quot;Goal!&quot; football movie trilogy, &quot;Goal! 2: Living the Dream...&quot; (2007). The film follows former Newcastle United star Santiago Muñez as he is first scouted and then signed by Real Madrid for the 2005–06 season. The film&#x27;s creators wanted to put emphasis on the changes in Muñez&#x27;s life after his move to Madrid. Production was done with the full support of UEFA, allowing the film crew to use many real life players in cameo roles. Real Madrid squad members featured in the film included Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl, Sergio Ramos, Robinho, Michael Owen, Míchel Salgado, Júlio Baptista, Steve McManaman and Iván Helguera. Non-Real Madrid players to make cameo appearances included Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto&#x27;o, Andrés Iniesta, Pablo Aimar, Freddie Ljungberg, Cesc Fàbregas and Santiago Cañizares. In the film, both Florentino Pérez and Alfredo Di Stéfano presented the fictional player Muñez to the club after his signing.

&quot;Real, The Movie&quot; is a 2005 part feature, part documentary film that showcases the worldwide passion for Real Madrid. Produced by the club and directed by Borja Manso, it follows five sub-stories of fans from around the world and their love for the club. Along with the fictional portion of the film, it also contains real footage of the squad, during training at Ciudad Real Madrid, matches, and interviews. Although the film mentions all of the squad, it mainly focuses on &quot;galácticos&quot; such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Raúl, Luís Figo, Ronaldo, Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos, among others. The film was originally produced in Spanish, but has been dubbed for their worldwide fanbase.

The book &quot;White Storm: 100 years of Real Madrid&quot; by Phil Ball was the first English-language history of Real Madrid. Published in 2002, it talks about the most successful moments of the club during its first centenary, having been translated into various languages. In late 2011, Real Madrid released a digital music album, entitled &quot;Legends&quot;, and a remix of the club&#x27;s anthem, &quot;Himno del Real Madrid,&quot; was released as the first single from the album.

===Real Madrid TV===
Real Madrid TV is an encrypted digital television channel, operated by Real Madrid and specialising in the club. The channel is available in Spanish and English. It is located at Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas (Madrid), Real Madrid&#x27;s training centre.

===&quot;Hala Madrid&quot;===

&quot;Hala Madrid&quot; is a magazine published quarterly for the Real Madrid club members and the &quot;Madridistas Fan Club&quot; card holders. The phrase Hala Madrid, meaning &quot;Forward Madrid&quot; or &quot;Go Madrid&quot;, is also the title of the club&#x27;s official anthem, which is often sung by the Madridistas (the club&#x27;s fans). The magazine includes reports on the club&#x27;s matches in the previous month, as well as information about the reserve and youth teams. Features often include interviews with players, both past and present, and the club&#x27;s historic matches.

===Video games===
Real Madrid has appeared in many football-based video games, namely in the FIFA, EA Sports FC, and Pro Evolution Soccer series. A Real Madrid player has appeared on the cover of both titles a combined seven times.

In 2007, Spanish game publisher Virgin Play signed a deal with the club to make officially licensed Real Madrid video games. The only one released under the deal (due to Virgin Play&#x27;s liquidation in September 2009) would end up being &quot;Real Madrid: The Game&quot;, which was developed by Atomic Planet Entertainment and was published under Virgin Play&#x27;s publishing division V.2 Play in May 2009 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Windows, Wii and Nintendo DS exclusively in European territories Virgin Play released their products in. The game featured a career mode with a mixture of role-playing and simulation as well as arcade-styled Football gameplay.

<text>The resurrection of Jesus () is the Christian belief that God raised Jesus from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion, starting – or restoring – his exalted life as Christ and Lord. According to the New Testament writing, Jesus was firstborn from the dead, ushering in the Kingdom of God. He appeared to his disciples, calling the apostles to the Great Commission of forgiving sin and baptizing repenters, and ascended to Heaven.

For the Christian tradition, the bodily resurrection was the restoration to life of a transformed body powered by spirit, as described by Paul and the Gospel authors, that led to the establishment of Christianity. In Christian theology, the resurrection of Jesus is &quot;the central mystery of the Christian faith&quot;. It provides the foundation for that faith, as commemorated by Easter, along with Jesus&#x27;s life, death and sayings. For Christians, his resurrection is the guarantee that all the Christian dead will be resurrected at Christ&#x27;s (second coming).

Secular and liberal Christian scholarship asserts that religious experiences, such as the visionary appearances of Jesus and an inspired reading of the Biblical texts, gave the impetus to the belief in the exaltation of Jesus as a &quot;fulfillment of the scriptures&quot;, and a resumption of the missionary activity of Jesus&#x27;s followers.

Scholars of Jesus as a historical figure tend to generally avoid the topic, since many believe the matter to be about faith, or lack thereof.

== Biblical accounts ==

The conviction that Jesus was raised from the dead is found in the earliest evidence of Christian origins.

===Paul and the first Christians===
The moment of resurrection itself is not described in any of the canonical gospels, but all four contain passages in which Jesus is portrayed as predicting his death and resurrection, or contain allusions that &quot;the reader will understand&quot;. The New Testament writings do not contain any descriptions of a resurrection but rather accounts of an empty tomb and appearances of Jesus.

One of the letters sent by Paul the Apostle to one of the early Greek churches, the First Epistle to the Corinthians, contains one of the earliest Christian creeds referring to post-mortem appearances of Jesus, and expressing the belief that he was raised from the dead, namely 1 Corinthians 15:3–8. It is widely accepted that this creed predates Paul and the writing of First Corinthians. Scholars have contended that in his presentation of the resurrection, Paul refers to this as an earlier authoritative tradition, transmitted in a rabbinic style, that he received and has passed on to the church at Corinth. Geza Vermes writes that the creed is &quot;a tradition he [Paul] has inherited from his seniors in the faith concerning the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus&quot;. The creed&#x27;s ultimate origins are probably within the Jerusalem apostolic community, having been formalised and passed on within a few years of the resurrection. Hans Grass argues for an origin in Damascus, and according to Paul Barnett, this creedal formula, and others, were variants of the &quot;one basic early tradition that Paul &quot;received&quot; in Damascus from Ananias in about 34 [AD]&quot; after his conversion.

In the Jerusalem (Church), from which Paul received this creed, the phrase &quot;died for our sins&quot; probably was an apologetic rationale for the death of Jesus as being part of God&#x27;s plan and purpose, as evidenced in the scriptures. For Paul, it gained a deeper significance, providing &quot;a basis for the salvation of sinful Gentiles apart from the Torah&quot;. The phrase &quot;died for our sins&quot; was derived from Isaiah, especially 53:4–11, and 4 Maccabees, especially 6:28–29. &quot;Raised on the third day&quot; is derived from Hosea 6:1–2:

Paul, writing to the members of the church at Corinth, said that Jesus appeared to him in the same fashion in which he appeared to the earlier witnesses. In 2 Corinthians 12 Paul described &quot;a man in Christ [presumably Paul himself] who ... was caught up to the third heaven&quot;, and while the language is obscure, a plausible interpretation is that the man believed he saw Jesus enthroned at the right hand of God.

The many Pauline references affirming his belief in the resurrection include:

* Romans 1:3–4: &quot;...concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh and designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord&quot;.
* 2 Timothy 2:8: &quot;Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead... this is my gospel for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God’s word is not chained...&quot;
* 1 Corinthians 15:3–7: &quot;...that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures...&quot;

=== Gospels and Acts ===


Jesus is described as the &quot;firstborn from the dead&quot;, , the first to be raised from the dead, thereby acquiring the &quot;special status of the firstborn as the preeminent son and heir&quot;. His resurrection is also the guarantee that all the Christian dead will be resurrected at Christ&#x27;s .

After the resurrection, Jesus is portrayed as calling the apostles to the Great Commission, as described in Matthew 28:16–20, Mark 16:14–18, Luke 24:44–49, Acts 1:4–8, and John 20:19–23, in which the disciples receive the call &quot;to let the world know the good news of a victorious Saviour and the very presence of God in the world by the spirit&quot;. According to these texts, Jesus says that they &quot;will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you&quot;, that &quot;repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in [the Messiah&#x27;s] name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem&quot;, and that &quot;if you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained&quot;. 

The shorter version of the Gospel of Mark ends with the discovery of the empty tomb by Mary Magdalene, Salome, and &quot;Mary the mother of James&quot;. A young man in a white robe at the site of the tomb announced to them that Jesus has risen, and instructed them to &quot;tell Peter and the disciples that he will meet them in Galilee, &#x27;just as he told you (Mark 16). 

In the Gospel of Matthew, an angel appeared to Mary Magdalene at the empty tomb, telling her that Jesus is not there because he has been raised from the dead, and instructing her to tell the other followers to go to Galilee, to meet Jesus. Jesus then appeared to Mary Magdalene and &quot;the other Mary&quot; at the tomb; and next, based on Mark 16:7, Jesus appeared to all the disciples on a mountain in Galilee, where Jesus claimed authority over heaven and earth, and commissioned the disciples to preach the gospel to the whole world. In this message, the end times are delayed &quot;to bring the world to discipleship&quot;.

In the Gospel of Luke, &quot;the women who had come with him from Galilee&quot; come to his tomb, which they find empty. Two angelic beings appeared to announce that Jesus is not there but has been raised. Jesus then appeared to two followers on their way to Emmaus, who notify the eleven remaining Apostles, who respond that Jesus has appeared to Peter. While they were describing this, Jesus appeared again, explaining that he is the messiah who was raised from the dead according to the scriptures &quot;and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem&quot;. In Luke–Acts (two works from the same author) he then ascended into heaven, his rightful home.

In Acts of the Apostles, Jesus appeared to the apostles for forty days and commanded them to stay in Jerusalem, after which Jesus ascended to heaven, followed by the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost and the missionary task of the early church.

==Jewish-Hellenistic background ==
===Jewish===

In Judaism, the idea of resurrection first emerges in the 3rd century BC Book of Watchers and in the 2nd century BC Book of Daniel, the later possibly as a belief in the resurrection of the soul alone, which was then developed by the Pharisees as a belief in bodily resurrection, an idea completely alien to the Greeks. Josephus tells of the three main Jewish sects of the 1st century AD, that the Sadducees held that both soul and body perished at death; the Essenes that the soul was immortal but the flesh was not; and the Pharisees that the soul was immortal and that the body would be resurrected to house it. Of these three positions, Jesus and the early Christians appear to have been closest to that of the Pharisees. Steve Mason notes that for the Pharisees, &quot;the new body is a special, holy body&quot;, which is different from the old body, &quot;a view shared to some extent by the ex-Pharisee Paul (1. Cor. 15:35ff)&quot;.

The evidence from Jewish texts and from tomb inscriptions points to a more complex reality: for example, when the author of the Book of Daniel wrote that &quot;many of those sleeping in the dust shall awaken&quot;, religion scholar Dag Øistein Endsjø believes he probably had in mind a rebirth as angelic beings (metaphorically described as stars in God&#x27;s Heaven, stars having been identified with angels from early times); such a rebirth would rule out a bodily resurrection, as angels were believed to be fleshless. Other scholars hold that Daniel exposes a belief in a bodily resurrection. Other texts range from the traditional Old Testament view that the soul would spend eternity in the underworld, to a metaphorical belief in the raising of the spirit. Most avoided defining what resurrection might imply, but a resurrection of the flesh was a marginal belief. As Outi Lehtipuu states, &quot;belief in resurrection was far from being an established doctrine&quot; of Second Temple Judaism.

===Greco-Roman===
The Greeks traditionally held that a number of men and women gained physical immortality as they were translated to live forever in either Elysium, the Islands of the Blessed, heaven, the ocean, or literally right under the ground. While some scholars have attempted to trace resurrection beliefs in pagan traditions concerning death and bodily disappearances, the attitudes towards resurrection were generally negative among pagans. For example, Asclepius was killed by Zeus for using herbs to resurrect the dead, but by his father Apollo&#x27;s request, was subsequently immortalized as a star. According to Bart Ehrman, most of the alleged parallels between Jesus and pagan deities only exist in the modern imagination, and there are no &quot;accounts of others who were born to virgin mothers and who died as an atonement for sin and then were raised from the dead&quot;.

From Hellenistic times on, some Greeks held that the soul of a meritorious man could be translated into a god in the process of apotheosis (divinization) which then transferred them to a special place of honour. Successors of Alexander the Great made this idea very well known throughout the Middle East through coins bearing his image, a privilege previously reserved for gods. The idea was adopted by the Roman emperors, and in the Imperial Roman concept of apotheosis, the earthly body of the recently deceased emperor was replaced by a new and divine one as he ascended into heaven. These stories proliferated in the middle to late first century.

The apotheosised dead remained recognisable to those who met them, as when Romulus appeared to witnesses after his death, but as the biographer Plutarch () explained of this incident, while something within humans comes from the gods and returns to them after death, this happens &quot;only when it is most completely separated and set free from the body, and becomes altogether pure, fleshless, and undefiled&quot;.

==Burial and empty tomb==
Scholars differ on the historicity of the empty tomb story and the relation between the burial stories and the postmortem appearances. Scholars also differ on whether Jesus received a decent burial. Points of contention are (1) whether Jesus&#x27;s body was taken off the cross before sunset or left on the cross to decay, (2) whether his body was taken off the cross and buried specifically by Joseph of Arimathea, or by the Sanhedrin or a group of Jews in general, and (3) whether he was entombed (and if so, what kind of tomb) or buried in a common grave.

With regard to the question what produced the faith that Jesus was raised from the dead, Schroter and Jacobi state that the assumption of the empty tomb, and the view that the disciples were convinced they saw Jesus risen from the dead, finds widely support in New Testament scholarship. Challenges such as Gerd Ludemanns, who argues that the tomb was not really empty but takes the stories of Jesus&#x27; appearances as describing real events, explaining them as subjective visions, remain a minority. Yet they also note that &quot;The question about the historicity of the empty tomb [..] cannot be answered,&quot; but does not seem to be factor that produces faith in the resurrection, but rather functions as a narrative link between cruxifixion and resurrection.

===Burial===
An often noted argument in favour of a decent burial before sunset is the Jewish custom, based on Deuteronomy 21:22–23, which says the body must not be left exposed overnight, but must be buried that day. This is also attested in the Temple Scroll of the Essenes, and in Josephus&#x27; &quot;Jewish War&quot; 4.5.2§317, describing the burial of crucified Jewish insurgents before sunset. Reference is made to the Digesta, a Roman Law Code from the 6th century AD, which contains material from the 2nd century AD, stating that &quot;the bodies of those who have been punished are only buried when this has been requested and permission granted&quot;. Burial of people who were executed by crucifixion is also attested by archaeological finds from Jehohanan, a body of an apparently crucified man with a nail in the heel which could not be removed who was buried in a tomb.

Contra a decent burial, Martin Hengel has argued that Jesus was buried in disgrace as an executed criminal who died a shameful death, a view which is &quot;now widely accepted and has become entrenched in scholarly literature&quot;. John Dominic Crossan argued that Jesus&#x27;s followers did not know what happened to the body. According to Crossan, Joseph of Arimathea is &quot;a total Markan creation in name, in place, and in function&quot;, arguing that Jesus&#x27;s followers inferred from Deut. 21:22–23 that Jesus was buried by a group of law-abiding Jews, as described in Acts 13:29.

New Testament scholar Dale Allison writes that this story was adapted by Mark, turning the group of Jews into a specific person. Roman practice was often to leave the body on the stake, denying an honourable or family burial, stating that &quot;the dogs were waiting.&quot; Archaeologist Byron McCane argues that it was customary to dispose of the dead immediately, yet concludes that &quot;Jesus was buried in disgrace in a criminal&#x27;s tomb&quot;. British New Testament scholar Maurice Casey also notes that &quot;Jewish criminals were supposed to receive a shameful and dishonourable burial&quot;, and argues that Jesus was indeed buried by Joseph of Arimathea, but in a tomb for criminals owned by the Sanhedrin. He therefore rejects the empty tomb narrative as legendary.

New Testament historian Bart D. Ehrman writes that it cannot be known what happened to Jesus&#x27;s body; he doubts that Jesus had a decent burial, and also thinks that it is doubtful that Jesus was buried by Joseph of Arimathea specifically. According to Ehrman, &quot;what was originally a vague statement that the unnamed Jewish leaders buried Jesus becomes a story of one leader in particular, who is named, doing so&quot;. Ehrman gives three reasons for doubting a decent burial. Referring to Hengel and Crossan, Ehrman argues that crucifixion was meant &quot;to torture and humiliate a person as fully as possible&quot;, and the body was normally left on the stake to be eaten by animals. Ehrman further argues that criminals were usually buried in common graves; and Pilate had no concern for Jewish sensitivities, which makes it unlikely that he would have allowed Jesus to be buried.

A number of Christian authors have rejected the criticisms, taking the Gospel accounts to be historically reliable. John A.T. Robinson states that &quot;the burial of Jesus in the tomb is one of the earliest and best-attested facts about Jesus&quot;. Dale Allison, reviewing the arguments of Crossan and Ehrman, finds their assertions strong, but &quot;find[s] it likely that a man named Joseph, probably a Sanhedrist, from the obscure Arimathea, sought and obtained permission from the Roman authorities to make arrangements for Jesus’s hurried burial&quot;. James Dunn states that &quot;the tradition is firm that Jesus was given a proper burial (Mark 15.42-47 pars.), and there are good reasons why its testimony should be respected&quot;.

Dunn argues that the burial tradition is &quot;one of the oldest pieces of tradition we have&quot;, referring to 1 Cor. 15.4; burial was in line with Jewish custom as prescribed by Deut. 21:22–23 and confirmed by Josephus &quot;War&quot;; cases of burial of crucified persons are known, as attested by the Yehohanan burial; Joseph of Arimathea &quot;is a very plausible historical character&quot;; and &quot;the presence of the women at the cross and their involvement in Jesus&#x27;s burial can be attributed more plausibly to early oral memory than to creative story-telling&quot;. Craig A. Evans refers to Deut. 21:22-23 and Josephus to argue that the entombment of Jesus accords with Jewish sensitivities and historical reality. Evans also notes that &quot;politically, too, it seems unlikely that, on the eve of Passover, a holiday that celebrates Israel&#x27;s liberation from foreign domination, Pilate would have wanted to provoke the Jewish population&quot; by denying Jesus a proper burial. Andrew Loke, after replying to various objections against the historicity of the guards at the tomb, argues that &quot;the presence of guards at the tomb would imply that Jesus was buried in a well-identified place (contrary to unburied hypothesis)&quot;.

According to religion professor John Granger Cook, there are historical texts that mention mass graves, but they contain no indication of those bodies being dug up by animals. There is no mention of an open pit or shallow graves in any Roman text. There are a number of historical texts outside the gospels showing the bodies of the crucified dead were buried by family or friends. Cook writes that &quot;those texts show that the narrative of Joseph of Arimethaea&#x27;s burial of Jesus would be perfectly comprehensible to a Greco-Roman reader of the gospels and historically credible&quot;.

===Empty tomb===
====Skepticism about the empty tomb narrative====
Early on, the stories about the empty tomb were met with skepticism. The Gospel of Matthew already mentions stories that the body was stolen from the grave. Other suggestions, not supported in mainstream scholarship, are that Jesus had not really died on the cross, was lost due to natural causes, or was replaced by an impostor.

The belief that Jesus did not really die on the cross but only appeared to do so is found in a wide variety of early texts, and probably has its historical roots in the earliest stages of Christianity. According to Israeli religion scholar Gedaliahu Stroumsa, this idea came first, and later, docetism broadened to include Jesus was a spirit without flesh. It is probable these were present in the first century, as it is against such doctrines that the author of 1 and 2 John seems to argue.

The absence of any reference to the story of Jesus&#x27;s empty tomb in the Pauline epistles and the Easter kerygma (preaching or proclamation) of the earliest church has led some scholars to suggest that Mark invented it. Allison, however, finds this argument from silence unconvincing. Most scholars believe that the Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of John contain two independent attestations of an empty tomb, which in turn suggests that both used already-existing sources and appealed to a commonly held tradition, though Mark may have added to and adapted that tradition to fit his narrative. Other scholars have argued that instead, Paul presupposes the empty tomb, specifically in the early creed passed down in 1 Cor. 15. Christian biblical scholars have used textual critical methods to support the historicity of the tradition that &quot;Mary of Magdala had indeed been the first to see Jesus&quot;, most notably the Criterion of Embarrassment in recent years. According to Dale Allison, the inclusion of women as the first witnesses to the risen Jesus &quot;once suspect, confirms the truth of the story&quot;.

====Empty tomb and resurrection appearances====
N. T. Wright emphatically and extensively argues for the reality of the empty tomb and the subsequent appearances of Jesus, reasoning that as a matter of &quot;inference&quot; both a bodily resurrection and later bodily appearances of Jesus are far better explanations for the empty tomb and the &#x27;meetings&#x27; and the rise of Christianity than are any other theories, including those of Ehrman. Raymond E. Brown concurred, stating &quot;...in my judgment, the evidence for the bodily resurrection of Jesus is strong...&quot;, and critiqued skeptical objections. James DG Dunn writes that the majority of scholars of the Bible believe that the evidence shows that the Resurrection of Jesus is historical. Dale Allison argues for an empty tomb that was later followed by visions of Jesus by the Apostles and Mary Magdalene, while also accepting the historicity of the resurrection. While he acknowledges contradictions in the Gospels&#x27; narratives, he argues that they agree on the important themes and that the differences are inconsequential when judging the historical event as a whole. Allison has endorsed David Graieg&#x27;s work on the Resurrection appearances, which also argues that early Christians remembered Jesus as having physically risen from the dead. Using a methodology based on memory theory, Graieg argues that Paul in First Corinthians remembered Jesus as having bodily risen from the dead and that the resurrection was of core importance to early Christians. Graieg argues that Jesus physically rose from the dead and that he was remembered by Christians as having risen in a metamorphized form. Religion professor Dag Øistein Endsjø points to how the notion of an empty tomb would fit with the ancient Greek beliefs that any case of immortalization always required absolute physical continuity. A vanished body could consequently be an indication of someone having been made immortal, as seen for instance in the case of Aristaeus, the Trojan prince Ganymede, and princess Orithyia of Athens, whose mysterious disappearances were seen as the result of their being swept away to a physically immortal existence by the gods, Heracles whose lack of bodily remains after his funeral pyre was considered proof of his physical immortalization, and Aristeas of Proconnesus who was held to have reappeared after his body vanished from a locked room, which Endsjø interprets as something like a resurrection.

Smith argues that Mark has integrated two traditions, which were first separate, on the disappearance (from the tomb, interpreted as being taken to heaven) and appearance (post-mortem appearances), into one Easter narrative. According to Géza Vermes, the story of the empty tomb developed independently from the stories of the post-resurrection appearances, as they are never directly coordinated to form a combined argument. While the coherence of the empty tomb narrative is questionable, it is &quot;clearly an early tradition&quot;. Vermes notes that the story of the empty tomb conflicts with notions of a spiritual resurrection. According to Vermes, &quot;[t]he strictly Jewish bond of spirit and body is better served by the idea of the empty tomb and is no doubt responsible for the introduction of the notions of palpability (Thomas in John) and eating (Luke and John)&quot;. Ehrman rejects the story of the empty tomb, and argues that &quot;an empty tomb had nothing to do with it ... an empty tomb would not produce faith&quot;. Ehrman argues that the empty tomb was needed to underscore the physical resurrection of Jesus.

==Resurrection of a transformed body==

Géza Vermes notes that the story of the empty tomb conflicts with notions of a spiritual resurrection. According to Vermes, &quot;[t]he strictly Jewish bond of spirit and body is better served by the idea of the empty tomb and is no doubt responsible for the introduction of the notions of palpability (Thomas in John) and eating (Luke and John)&quot;.

Both Ware and Cook argue, primarily from Paul&#x27;s terminology and the contemporary Jewish, pagan and cultural understanding of the nature of resurrection, that Paul held to a physically resurrected body (&quot;sōma&quot;), restored to life, but animated by spirit (&quot;pneumatikos&quot;) instead of soul (&quot;psuchikos&quot;), just like the later Gospel accounts. The nature of this resurrected body is a matter of debate. In 1 Corinthians 15:44, Paul uses the phrase &quot;spiritual body&quot; (&quot;sōma pneumatikos&quot;), which has been explained as a &quot;Spirit-empowered body&quot;, but also as a &quot;celestial body&quot;, made of a finer material than the flesh. 

In the Epistle to the Philippians Paul describes how the body of the resurrected Christ is utterly different from the one he wore when he had &quot;the appearance of a man&quot;, and holds out a similar glorified state, when Christ &quot;will transform our lowly body&quot;, as the goal of the Christian life – &quot;flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God&quot; (I Corinthians 15:50), and Christians entering the kingdom will be &quot;putting off the body of the flesh&quot; (Colossians 2:11). Paul opposed the notion of a purely spiritual resurrection, as propagated by some Christians in Corinth, which he addresses in 1 Corinthians. The developing Gospel tradition emphasized the material aspects to counter this spiritual interpretation.

Paul&#x27;s views of a bodily resurrection went against the thoughts of the Greek philosophers to whom a bodily resurrection meant a new imprisonment in a corporeal body, which was what they wanted to avoid – given that, for them, the corporeal and the material fettered the spirit.

James Dunn notes that there is a great difference between Paul&#x27;s resurrection appearance, and the appearances described in the Gospels. Where &quot;Paul&#x27;s seeing was visionary ... , &#x27;from heaven&#x27;&quot;, in contrast, the Gospel accounts have a &quot;massive realism&quot; to them, as seen for example in Luke having Jesus insisting that he was of &quot;flesh and bones&quot;, and John having Jesus asking Thomas to touch his wounds. Dunn contends that the &quot;massive realism&#x27; ... of the [Gospel] appearances themselves can only be described as visionary with great difficulty – and Luke would certainly reject the description as inappropriate&quot;. According to Dunn, most scholars explain this as a &quot;legendary materialization&quot; of the visionary experiences, &quot;borrowing the traits of the earthly Jesus&quot;. Yet, according to Dunn, there was both &quot;a tendency away from the physical ... and a reverse tendency towards the physical&quot;. The tendency towards the material is most clear, but there are also signs for the tendency away from the physical, and &quot;there are some indications that a more physical understanding was current in the earliest Jerusalem community&quot;.

According to Wright, there is substantial unanimity among the early Christian writers (1st and 2nd century) that Jesus had been bodily raised from the dead, &quot;with (as the early Christians in their different ways affirmed) a &#x27;transphysical&#x27; body, both the same and yet in some mysterious way transformed&quot;. According to Wright, Paul &quot;believed he had seen the risen Jesus in person, and ... his understanding of who this Jesus was included the firm belief that he possessed a transformed but still physical body&quot;.

== Significance in Christianity ==

===Foundation of Christian faith===
In Christian theology, the death, resurrection, and exaltation of Jesus are the most important events, and the foundation of the Christian faith. The Nicene Creed states: &quot;On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures&quot;. According to Terry Miethe, a Christian philosopher at Oxford University, the question &quot; &#x27;Did Jesus rise from the dead?&#x27; is the most important question regarding the claims of the Christian faith.&quot; According to John R. Rice, a Baptist evangelist, the resurrection of Jesus was part of the plan of salvation and redemption by atonement for man&#x27;s sin. According to the Roman Catechism of the Catholic Church, the resurrection of Jesus causes and is the model of the resurrection of all the dead, as well as the cause and model of repentance, which the catechism calls &quot;spiritual resurrection&quot;. Summarizing its traditional analysis, the Catholic Church states in its Catechism:
For orthodox Christians, including a number of scholars, the resurrection of Jesus is taken to have been a concrete, material resurrection of a transformed body. Scholars such as Craig L. Blomberg and Mike Licona argue there are sufficient arguments for the historicity of the resurrection.

In secular and liberal Christian scholarship, the post-resurrection appearances are often interpreted as being subjective visionary experiences in which Jesus&#x27;s presence was felt, as articulated in the vision theory of Jesus&#x27;s appearances. In the 21st century, modern scholars such as Gerd Lüdemann have proposed that Peter had a vision of Jesus, due to severe grief and mourning. Ehrman notes that &quot;Christian apologists sometimes claim that the most sensible historical explanation for these visions is that Jesus [physically] appeared to the disciples&quot;.

===First &quot;ekklēsia&quot;===
The belief in the resurrection by Jesus&#x27;s early followers formed the proclamation of the first &quot;ekklēsia&quot; (lit. &quot;assembly&quot;). The &quot;visions of the resurrected/exalted Christ&quot; reinforced the impact Jesus and his ministry had on his early followers, and interpreted in a scriptural framework they gave the impetus to Christ-devotion and the belief in the exaltation of Jesus. Jesus&#x27;s death was interpreted in light of the scriptures as a redemptive death, being part of God&#x27;s plan. The subsequent appearances led to the resumption of the missionary activity of Jesus&#x27;s followers, with Peter assuming the leadership role in the first &quot;ekklēsia&quot; (which formed the basis for the Apostolic succession).

In the &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, a 1st-century account of Jewish history by Josephus, believers of the resurrection are discussed. However, this reference to the resurrection is widely believed to have been added by a Christian interpolator. Within the non-canonical literature of Gospel of Peter, there is a retelling of the resurrection of Jesus.

====Ushering in the last days====
Jesus&#x27;s followers expected God&#x27;s Kingdom to come soon, and Jesus&#x27;s resurrection was the first event of the Endtime. As Borg and Crossan note, &quot;For Mark the kingdom of God is already here because the Son of Man is already present&quot;.

====Exaltation and Christology====
=====Christ-devotion=====
The New Testament writings contend that the resurrection was &quot;the beginning of His exalted life&quot; as Christ and Lord. Jesus is the &quot;firstborn of the dead&quot;, &quot;prōtotokos&quot;, the first to be raised from the dead, thereby acquiring the &quot;special status of the firstborn as the preeminent son and heir&quot;. Gregory Beale writes:

Hurtado notes that soon after his death, Jesus was called Lord (&quot;Kyrios&quot;), which &quot;associates him in astonishing ways with God&quot;. The term Lord reflected the belief that God had exalted Jesus to a divine status &quot;at God&#x27;s &#x27;right hand&#x27;&quot;. The worship of God as expressed in the phrase &quot;call upon the name of the Lord [&quot;Yahweh&quot;]&quot; was also applied to Jesus, invocating his name &quot;in corporate worship and in the wider devotional pattern of Christian believers (e.g., baptism, exorcism, healing)&quot;.

According to Hurtado, powerful religious experiences were an indispensable factor in the emergence of Christ-devotion. Those experiences &quot;seem to have included visions of (and/or ascents to) God&#x27;s heaven, in which the glorified Christ was seen in an exalted position&quot;. Those experiences were interpreted in the framework of God&#x27;s redemptive purposes, as reflected in the scriptures, in a &quot;dynamic interaction between devout, prayerful searching for, and pondering over, scriptural texts and continuing powerful religious experiences&quot;. This initiated a &quot;new devotional pattern unprecedented in Jewish monotheism&quot;, that is, the worship of Jesus next to God, giving Jesus a central place because his ministry, and its consequences, had a strong impact on his early followers. Revelations, including those visions, but also inspired and spontaneous utterances, and &quot;charismatic exegesis&quot; of the Jewish scriptures, convinced them that this devotion was commanded by God.

Ehrman notes that both Jesus and his early followers were apocalyptic Jews, who believed in the bodily resurrection, which would start when the coming of God&#x27;s Kingdom was near. According to Ehrman, &quot;the disciples&#x27; belief in the resurrection was based on visionary experiences&quot;, arguing that visions usually have a strong persuasive power, but also noting that the Gospel-accounts record a tradition of doubt about the appearances of Jesus. Ehrman&#x27;s &quot;tentative suggestion&quot; is that only a few followers had visions, including Peter, Paul and Mary. They told others about those visions, convincing most of their close associates that Jesus was raised from the dead, but not all of them. Eventually, these stories were retold and embellished, leading to the story that all disciples had seen the risen Jesus. The belief in Jesus&#x27;s resurrection radically changed their perceptions, concluding from his absence that he must have been exalted to heaven, by God himself, exalting him to an unprecedented status and authority.

While the vision theory has gained support among critical scholars since the last quarter of the 20th century, conservative Christian scholars who believe in a bodily resurrection reject the visionary theories in favor of a literal interpretation of the textual accounts of a physical resurrection.
=====Low and High Christology=====
It has long been argued that the New Testament writings contain two different Christologies, namely a &quot;low&quot; or adoptionist Christology, and a &quot;high&quot; or &quot;incarnation Christology&quot;. The &quot;low Christology&quot; or &quot;adoptionist Christology&quot; is the belief &quot;that God exalted Jesus to be his Son by raising him from the dead&quot;, thereby raising him to &quot;divine status&quot;, as in Romans 1:4. The other early Christology is &quot;high Christology&quot;, which is &quot;the view that Jesus was a pre-existent divine being who became a human, did the Father’s will on earth, and then was taken back up into heaven whence he had originally come&quot;, and from where he appeared on earth. The chronology of the development of these early Christologies is a matter of debate within contemporary scholarship.

According to the &quot;evolutionary model&quot; c.q. &quot;evolutionary theories&quot;, as proposed by Bousset, followed by Brown, the Christological understanding of Christ developed over time, from a low Christology to a high Christology, as witnessed in the Gospels. According to the evolutionary model, the earliest Christians believed that Jesus was a human who was exalted, c.q. adopted as God&#x27;s Son, when he was resurrected, signalling the nearness of the Kingdom of God, when all dead would be resurrected and the righteous exalted. Later beliefs shifted the exaltation to his baptism, birth, and subsequently to the idea of his eternal existence, as witnessed in the Gospel of John. Mark shifted the moment of when Jesus became the son to the baptism of Jesus, and later still Matthew and Luke shifted it to the moment of the divine conception, and finally John declared that Jesus had been with God from the beginning: &quot;In the beginning was the Word&quot;.

Since the 1970s, the late datings for the development of a &quot;high Christology&quot; have been contested, and a majority of scholars argue that this &quot;High Christology&quot; existed already before the writings of Paul. This &quot;incarnation Christology&quot; or &quot;high Christology&quot; did not evolve over a longer time, but was a &quot;big bang&quot; of ideas which were already present at the start of Christianity, and took further shape in the first few decades of the church, as witnessed in the writings of Paul.

According to Ehrman, these two Christologies existed alongside each other, calling the &quot;low Christology&quot; an &quot;adoptionist Christology, and &quot;the &quot;high Christology&quot; an &quot;incarnation Christology.&quot; While adoptionism was declared heresy at the end of the 2nd century, it was adhered to by the Ebionites, who regarded Jesus as the Messiah while rejecting his divinity and his virgin birth, and insisted on the necessity of following Jewish law and rites. They revered James the brother of Jesus (James the Just); and rejected Paul the Apostle as an apostate from the Law. They show strong similarities with the earliest form of Jewish Christianity, and their specific theology may have been a &quot;reaction to the law-free Gentile mission.&quot;

In the &quot;pre-existence&quot; Christology, Christ&#x27;s resurrection and exaltation was a restoration of the exalted status he already had, but had not grasped at, as described in Philippians|2:6-11.

====Redemptive death====
Jesus&#x27;s death was interpreted as a redemptive death &quot;for our sins&quot;, in accordance with God&#x27;s plan as contained in the Jewish scriptures. The significance lay in &quot;the theme of divine necessity and fulfilment of the scriptures&quot;, not in the later Pauline emphasis on &quot;Jesus&#x27;s death as a sacrifice or an expiation for our sins&quot;. For the early Jewish Christians, &quot;the idea that Messiah&#x27;s death was a necessary redemptive event functioned more as an apologetic explanation for Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion&quot; &quot;proving that Jesus&#x27;s death was no surprise to God&quot;.

====Call to missionary activity====
The New Testament accounts describe the resurrected Jesus calling his followers to missionary activity in what has been traditionally labelled as the Great Commission, where he instructs them to &quot;make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and the Holy Spirit&quot;.

According to Dunn, the appearances to the disciples have &quot;a sense of obligation to make the vision known&quot;. Helmut Koester states that the stories of the resurrection were originally epiphanies in which the disciples were called to a ministry by the risen Jesus, and were later used as evidence of the event. Biblical scholar Géza Vermes argues that the resurrection is to be understood as a reviving of the self-confidence of the followers of Jesus, under the influence of the Spirit, &quot;prompting them to resume their apostolic mission&quot;. According to Gerd Lüdemann, Peter convinced the other disciples that the resurrection of Jesus signalled that the end-times were near and God&#x27;s Kingdom was coming, when the dead would rise again, as evidenced by Jesus. This revitalized the disciples, starting off their new mission.

====Leadership of Peter====
Peter claimed forcefully that Jesus appeared to him, and legitimised by Jesus&#x27;s appearance he assumed leadership of the group of early followers, forming the Jerusalem &quot;ekklēsia&quot; mentioned by Paul. He was soon eclipsed in this leadership by James the Just, &quot;the Brother of the Lord&quot;, which may explain why the early texts contain scarce information about Peter. According to Gerd Lüdemann, Peter was the first who saw Jesus, noting that Peter and Mary both had appearance-experiences, but arguing that the tradition of Mary&#x27;s appearance is a later development, and her appearance probably was not the first.

According to Christian proto-orthodoxy, Peter was the first to who Jesus appeared, and therefore the rightful leader of the Church. The resurrection forms the basis of the Apostolic succession and the institutional power of orthodoxy, as the heirs of Peter, to whom Jesus appeared, and is described as &quot;the rock&quot; on which the church will be built. Though the Gospels, and Paul&#x27;s letters, describe appearances to a greater number of people, only the appearances to the Twelve Apostles count as lending authority and Apostolic succession.

===Paul – participation in Christ===
The appearance of Jesus to Paul convinced him that Jesus was the risen Lord and Christ, who commissioned him to be an apostle to the Gentiles. According to Newbigin, &quot;Paul presents himself not as the teacher of a new theology but as the messenger commissioned by the authority of the Lord himself to announce a new fact – namely that in the ministry, death and resurrection of Jesus God has acted decisively to reveal and effect his purpose of redemption for the whole world&quot;. The teachings of the apostle Paul form a key element of the Christian tradition and theology. Fundamental to Pauline theology is the connection between Christ&#x27;s resurrection, and redemption. In 1 Corinthians 15:13–14, 15:17, and 15:20–22, Paul writes:

The &quot;kerygma&quot; of 1 Corinthians 15:3 states that &quot;Christ died for our sins&quot;- The meaning of that &quot;kerygma&quot; is a matter of debate, and open to multiple interpretations. Traditionally, this &quot;kerygma&quot; is interpreted as meaning that Jesus&#x27;s death was an atonement or ransom for, or propitiation or expiation of, God&#x27;s wrath against humanity because of their sins. With Jesus&#x27;s death, humanity was freed from this wrath. In the classical Protestant understanding, which has dominated the understanding of Paul&#x27;s writings, humans partake in this salvation by faith in Jesus Christ; this faith is a grace given by God, and people are justified by God through Jesus Christ and faith in Him.

More recent scholarship has raised several concerns regarding these interpretations. According to E. P. Sanders, who initiated the so-called &quot;New Perspective on Paul&quot;, Paul saw the faithful redeemed by participation in Jesus&#x27;s death and rising. Though &quot;Jesus&#x27;s death substituted for that of others and thereby freed believers from sin and guilt&quot;, a metaphor derived from &quot;ancient sacrificial theology&quot;, the essence of Paul&#x27;s writing is not in the &quot;legal terms&quot; regarding the expiation of sin, but the act of &quot;participation in Christ through dying and rising with him&quot;. According to Sanders, &quot;those who are baptized into Christ are baptized into his death, and thus they escape the power of sin ... he died so that the believers may die with him and consequently live with him&quot;. Just as Christians share in Jesus&#x27;s death in baptism, so they will share in his resurrection. James F. McGrath notes that Paul &quot;prefers to use the language of participation. One died for all, so that all died. This is not only different from substitution, it is the opposite of it&quot;.

Paul insists that salvation is received by the grace of God; according to Sanders, this insistence is in line with Judaism of , which saw God&#x27;s covenant with Israel as an act of grace of God. Observance of the Law is needed to maintain the covenant, but the covenant is not earned by observing the Law, but by the grace of God.

===Church Fathers – atonement===
The Apostolic Fathers, discussed the death and resurrection of Jesus, including Ignatius (50–115), Polycarp (69–155), and Justin Martyr (100–165). The understanding of the Greek Fathers of the death and resurrection of Jesus as an atonement is the &quot;classic paradigm&quot; of the Church Fathers, who developed the themes found in the New Testament.

During the first millennium AD, the ransom theory of atonement was the dominant metaphor, both in eastern and western Christianity, until it was replaced in the west by Anselmus&#x27;s satisfaction theory of atonement. The ransom theory of atonement says that Christ liberated humanity from slavery to sin and Satan, and thus death, by giving his own life as a ransom sacrifice to Satan, swapping the life of the perfect (Jesus), for the lives of the imperfect (humans). It entails the idea that God deceived the devil, and that Satan, or death, had &quot;legitimate rights&quot; over sinful souls in the afterlife, due to the fall of man and inherited sin.

The ransom theory was first clearly enunciated by Irenaeus (c. 130–c. 202), who was an outspoken critic of Gnosticism, but borrowed ideas from their dualistic worldview. In this worldview, humankind is under the power of the Demiurge, a lesser God who has created the world. Yet, humans have a spark of the true divine nature within them, which can be liberated by gnosis (knowledge) of this divine spark. This knowledge is revealed by the Logos, &quot;the very mind of the supreme God&quot;, who entered the world in the person of Jesus. Nevertheless, the Logos could not simply undo the power of the Demiurge, and had to hide his real identity, appearing as a physical form, thereby misleading the Demiurge, and liberating humankind. In Irenaeus&#x27; writings, the Demiurge is replaced by the devil, while Justin Martyr had already equated Jesus and the Logos.

Origen (184–253) introduced the idea that the devil held legitimate rights over humans, who were bought free by the blood of Christ. He also introduced the notion that the devil was deceived in thinking that he could master the human soul.

===Late Antiquity and early Middle Ages===
Following the conversion of Constantine and the Edict of Milan in 313, the ecumenical councils of the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries, that focused on Christology, helped shape the Christian understanding of the redemptive nature of the resurrection, and influenced both the development of its iconography and its use within Liturgy.

Belief in bodily resurrection was a constant note of the Christian church in antiquity. Augustine of Hippo accepted it at the time of his conversion in 386. Augustine defended resurrection, and argued that given that Christ has risen, there is resurrection of the dead. Moreover, he argued that the death and resurrection of Jesus was for the salvation of man, stating: &quot;to achieve each resurrection of ours, the savior paid with his single life, and he pre-enacted and presented his one and only one by way of sacrament and by way of model&quot;.

The 5th-century theology of Theodore of Mopsuestia provides an insight into the development of the Christian understanding of the redemptive nature of resurrection. The crucial role of the sacraments in the mediation of salvation was well accepted at the time. In Theodore&#x27;s representation of the Eucharist, the sacrificial and salvific elements are combined in the &quot;One who saved us and delivered us by the sacrifice of Himself&quot;. Theodore&#x27;s interpretation of the Eucharistic rite is directed towards the triumph over the power of death brought about by the resurrection.

The emphasis on the salvific nature of the resurrection continued in Christian theology in the next centuries, e.g., in the 8th century Saint John of Damascus wrote that: &quot;... When he had freed those who were bound from the beginning of time, Christ returned again from among the dead, having opened for us the way to resurrection&quot; and Christian iconography of the ensuing years represented that concept.

===Present-day===
Thorwald Lorenzen finds &quot;a strange silence about the resurrection in many pulpits&quot;. He writes that among some Christians, ministers and professors, it seems to have become &quot;a cause for embarrassment or the topic of apologetics&quot;. The idea of a bodily resurrection remains controversial.

According to psychiatrist and author Adrian Warnock, many Christians neglect the resurrection because of their understandable preoccupation with the Cross.

===Denominations===
==== Roman Catholic Church ====
The resurrection of Jesus is the good news that the Roman Catholic Church proclaims: &quot;the revelation in Jesus Christ of God&#x27;s mercy to sinners&quot;. The importance of the resurrection is connected to the incarnation of Jesus: by becoming incarnate God has assumed every human unto himself, for his humanity is made of every human (just as a temple is made of stones), and by resurrecting himself God has also resurrected every human. 

By rising from the dead, Jesus is the beginning of the resurrection of the dead on Judgment Day and the beginning of the spiritual resurrection (justification or &quot;new life&quot;) of sinners, since Jesus is the first human resurrected by God, as the head of the human race as God incarnate, whereby in him all people have already been resurrected and justified, since his resurrection is the principle of the resurrection of the dead and justification of sinners. 

The resurrection is a historical yet transcendent event. The historical resurrection transcends spacetime by affecting every human, from Adam and Eve&#x27;s repentance after the fall to the resurrection of Lazarus (who returned to an earthly life) to the conversion of Saint Paul to the resurrection of the dead on Judgment Day.

By rising from the dead, Jesus shows what the risen bodies of the saints (i.e., justified sinners) will be like. From the moment of his incarnation, Jesus&#x27; soul experienced the beatific vision, because he is true God and true man, and from the moment of his resurrection Jesus&#x27; body shared in his soul&#x27;s experience of the beatific vision. At the resurrection, Jesus&#x27; whole humanity was deified, and so, shares in the personal mode of existence of the Second Person of the Trinity. Deification includes four properties: impassibility (freedom from evil, i.e., temptation, sin, suffering, error, inconvenience, boredom, Satan, and death), subtility (freedom from restraint by the laws of science, which includes shapeshifting, teleportation, time travel, control over nature, and superhuman senses and prowess), agility (one&#x27;s body will not act faster than one&#x27;s mind or give in to emotion and impulse, for the body will be as obedient to the soul as the soul is to God), and clarity (resplendent beauty and the five crowns).

== Easter ==
Easter is the preeminent Christian feast that celebrates the resurrection of Jesus, and according to Susan J. White is &quot;clearly the earliest Christian festival&quot;. According to James Dunn, &quot;In Easter we celebrate man become God ... that in the death and resurrection of Christ God has broken the stranglehold of human selfishness, has proved the enduring and conquering strength of divine love&quot;. According to Thorwald Lorenzen, the first Easter led to a shift in emphasis from faith &quot;in God&quot; to faith &quot;in Christ&quot;. According to Raymond Harfgus Taylor, Easter &quot;focuses upon the consummation of the redemptive act of God in the death/resurrection of Jesus Christ&quot;.

Easter is linked to the Passover and Exodus from Egypt recorded in the Old Testament through the Last Supper and crucifixion that preceded the resurrection. According to the New Testament, Jesus gave the Passover meal a new meaning, as he prepared himself and his disciples for his death in the upper room during the Last Supper. He identified the loaf of bread and cup of wine as his body soon to be sacrificed and his blood soon to be shed. 1 Corinthians 5:7 states, &quot;Get rid of the old yeast that you may be a new batch without yeastas you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed&quot;; this refers to the Passover requirement to have no yeast in the house and to the allegory of Jesus as the Paschal lamb. The Jewish feast of First-fruits is regarded by dispensationalists as foreshadowing its fulfilment in the resurrection of Jesus based on 1 Corinthians 15:20 &quot;But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep&quot;.

Whilst the fact that the crucifixion is remembered on Good Friday and Easter celebrated two days later may appear to contradict biblical accounts that Jesus rose on the third day, in Semitic tradition any part of a 24-hour period could be called &quot;a day and a night&quot;.

== In Christian art ==

In the Catacombs of Rome, artists indirectly hinted at the resurrection by using images from the Old Testament such as the fiery furnace and Daniel in the lions&#x27; den. Depictions prior to the 7th century generally showed secondary events such as the Myrrhbearers at the tomb of Jesus to convey the concept of the resurrection. An early symbol of the resurrection was the wreathed Chi Rho (Greek letters representing the word &quot;Khristos&quot; or &quot;Christ&quot;), whose origin traces to the victory of emperor Constantine I at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312, which he attributed to the use of a cross on the shields of his soldiers. Constantine used the Chi Rho on his standard and his coins showed a labarum with the Chi Rho killing a serpent.

The use of a wreath around the Chi Rho symbolizes the victory of the resurrection over death, and is an early visual representation of the connection between the crucifixion of Jesus and his triumphal resurrection, as seen in the 4th-century sarcophagus of Domitilla in Rome. Here, in the wreathed Chi Rho the death and Resurrection of Christ are shown as inseparable, and the Resurrection is not merely a happy ending tucked at the end of the life of Christ on earth. Given the use of similar symbols on the Roman military banner, this depiction also conveyed another victory, namely that of the Christian faith: the Roman soldiers who had once arrested Jesus and marched him to Calvary now walked under the banner of a resurrected Christ.

The cosmic significance of the resurrection in Western theology goes back to Saint Ambrose, who in the 4th century said that &quot;The universe rose again in Him, the heaven rose again in Him, the earth rose again in Him, for there shall be a new heaven and a new earth&quot;. This theme developed gradually in the West, later than in the East where the resurrection had been linked from an earlier date to redemption and the renewal and rebirth of the whole world. In art, this was symbolized by combining the depictions of the resurrection with the Harrowing of Hell in icons and paintings. A good example is from the Chora Church in Istanbul, where John the Baptist, Solomon and other figures are also present, depicting that Christ was not alone in the resurrection. The depiction sequence at the 10th-century Hosios Loukas shows Christ as he pulls Adam from his tomb, followed by Eve, signifying the salvation of humanity after the resurrection.

== Relics ==

The resurrection of Jesus has long been central to the Christian faith and appears within diverse elements of the Christian tradition, from feasts to artistic depictions to religious relics. In Christian teachings, the sacraments derive their saving power from the passion and resurrection of Christ, upon which the salvation of the world entirely depends.

An example of the interweaving of the teachings on the resurrection with Christian relics is the application of the concept of &quot;miraculous image formation&quot; at the moment of resurrection to the Shroud of Turin. Christian authors have stated the belief that the body around whom the shroud was wrapped was not merely human, but divine, and that the image on the shroud was miraculously produced at the moment of resurrection. Quoting Pope Paul VI&#x27;s statement that the shroud is &quot;the wonderful document of His Passion, Death and Resurrection, written for us in letters of blood&quot; author Antonio Cassanelli argues that the shroud is a deliberate divine record of the five stages of the Passion of Christ, created at the moment of resurrection.

== Views of other religions ==
Groups such as Jews, Muslims, Baháʼís, and other non-Christians, as well as some liberal Christians, dispute whether Jesus actually rose from the dead. Arguments over death and resurrection claims occur at many religious debates and interfaith dialogues.

=== Judaism ===
Christianity split from Judaism in the 1st century AD, and the two faiths have differed in their theology since. According to the &quot;Toledot Yeshu&quot;, the body of Jesus was removed on the same night by a gardener named Juda, after hearing the disciples planned to steal the body of Jesus. However, &quot;Toledot Yeshu&quot; is not considered either canonical or normative within rabbinic literature. Van Voorst states that &quot;Toledot Yeshu&quot; is a medieval document set without a fixed form which is &quot;most unlikely&quot; to have reliable information about Jesus. The Blackwell Companion to Jesus states that the &quot;Toledot Yeshu&quot; has no historical facts as such, and was perhaps created as a tool for warding off conversions to Christianity.

=== Gnostics ===
Some Gnostics did not believe in a literal physical resurrection. &quot;For the gnostic any resurrection of the dead was excluded from the outset; the flesh or substance is destined to perish. &#x27;There is no resurrection of the flesh, but only of the soul&#x27;, say the so-called Archontics, a late gnostic group in Palestine&quot;.

=== Islam ===

Muslims believe that ʿĪsā (Jesus) son of Mariam (Mary) was a holy prophet with a divine message. The Islamic perspective is that Jesus was not crucified and will return to the world at the end of times. &quot;But Allāh raised him up to Himself. And Allāh is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise&quot;. The Quran says in Surah An-Nisa [Ch 004: Verse 157] &quot;And because of their saying, &#x27;We killed Messiah ʿĪsā, son of Maryam, the Messenger of Allāh&#x27;,but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared so to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts&quot;.

=== Islam Ahmadiyya ===
Ahmadi Muslims believe that, as Jesus is the Messiah to the Children of Israel his objective was to gather their following. For this reason, Ahmadis believe that Jesus survived the crucifixion, as supported by the Qur&#x27;an, as a death on the cross would be a cursed one, supported by the Bible. This belief is held as Jesus had other &quot;sheep&quot; to tend to.

After surviving the crucifixion, Jesus and his mother migrated to another land where he continued his mission.

<text>Andrew &quot;Rube&quot; Foster (September 17, 1879 – December 9, 1930) was an American baseball player, manager, and executive in the Negro leagues. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1981.

Foster, considered by historians to have been perhaps the best African-American pitcher of the first decade of the 1900s, also founded and managed the Chicago American Giants, one of the most successful black baseball teams of the pre-integration era. Most notably, he organized the Negro National League, the first long-lasting professional league for African-American ballplayers, which operated from 1920 to 1931. He is known as the &quot;father of Black Baseball.&quot;

Foster adopted his longtime nickname, &quot;Rube&quot;, as his official middle name later in life.

==Early years==
Foster was born in Calvert, Texas, on September 17, 1879. His father, also named Andrew, was a minister and elder of the local African Methodist Episcopal Church. Foster started his professional career with the Waco Yellow Jackets, an independent black team, in 1897 and played for the Hot Springs Arlingtons in 1901. Over the next few years he gradually built up a reputation among white and black fans alike, until he was signed by Frank Leland&#x27;s Chicago Union Giants, a team in the top ranks of black baseball, in 1902. He was released after a slump and signed with a white semipro team based in Otsego, Michigan—Bardeen&#x27;s Otsego Independents. According to Phil Dixon&#x27;s American Baseball Chronicles: Great Teams, The 1905 Philadelphia Giants, Volume III: &quot;In completing the summer of 1902 with Otsego&#x27;s multi-ethnic team—the only multi-race team with which he would ever regularly perform—Foster is reported to have pitched twelve games. He finished with a documented record of eight wins and four losses along with eighty-two documented strikeouts. Ironically, strikeout totals for five games in which he appeared were not recorded. If found, the totals would likely show that Foster struck out more than one-hundred batters for Otsego. In the seven games where details exist, Foster averaged eleven strikeouts per outing.&quot; Toward the end of the season, he joined the Cuban X-Giants of Philadelphia, perhaps the best team in black baseball. The 1903 season saw Foster establish himself as the X-Giants&#x27; pitching star. In a postseason series for the eastern black championship, the X-Giants defeated Sol White&#x27;s Philadelphia Giants five games to two, with Foster himself winning four games.

According to various accounts, including his own, Foster acquired the nickname &quot;Rube&quot; after defeating star Philadelphia Athletics left-hander Rube Waddell in a postseason exhibition game played sometime between 1902 and 1905. A newspaper story in the Trenton (NJ) &quot;Times&quot; from July 26, 1904, contains the earliest known example of Foster being referred to as &quot;Rube,&quot; indicating that the supposed meeting with Waddell must have taken place earlier than that. Recent research has uncovered a game played on August 2, 1903, in which Foster met and defeated Waddell while the latter was playing under an assumed name for a semipro team in New York City.

Foster, now a star, jumped to the Philadelphia Giants for the 1904 season. Legend has it that John McGraw, manager of the New York Giants, hired Foster to teach the young Christy Mathewson the &quot;fadeaway&quot;, or screwball, though historians have cast doubt on this story. During the 1904 season, Foster won 20 games against all competition (including two no-hitters) and lost six. In a rematch with Foster&#x27;s old team, the Cuban X-Giants, he won two games and batted .400 in leading the Philadelphia Giants to the black championship.

In 1905, Foster—by his own account several years later—compiled a fantastic record of 51–4 (though recent research has confirmed only a 25–3 record) and led the Giants to another series championship, this time over the Brooklyn Royal Giants. The &quot;Philadelphia Telegraph&quot; wrote that &quot;Foster has never been equalled in a pitcher&#x27;s box.&quot; The following season, the Philadelphia Giants helped form the International League of Independent Professional Ball Players, composed of both all-black and all-white teams in the Philadelphia and Wilmington, Delaware, areas.

==Leland Giants==
In 1907, Foster&#x27;s manager Sol White published his &quot;Official Baseball Guide: History of Colored Baseball&quot;, with Foster contributing an article on &quot;How to Pitch.&quot; However, before the season began, he and several other stars (including, most importantly, the outfielder Pete Hill) left the Philadelphia Giants for the Chicago Leland Giants, with Foster named playing manager. Under his leadership, the Lelands won 110 games (including 48 straight) and lost only ten, and took the Chicago City League pennant. The following season the Lelands tied a national championship series with the Philadelphia Giants, each team winning three games.

Foster suffered a broken leg in July 1909, but rushed himself back into the lineup in time for an October exhibition series against the Chicago Cubs. Foster, pitching the second game, squandered a 5–2 lead in the ninth inning, then lost the game on a controversial play when a Cubs runner stole home while Foster was arguing with the umpire. The Lelands lost the series, three games to nothing. The Lelands also lost the unofficial western black championship to the St. Paul Colored Gophers.

In 1910, Foster wrested legal control of the team from its founder, Frank Leland. He proceeded to put together the team he later considered his finest. He signed John Henry Lloyd away from the Philadelphia Giants; along with Hill, second baseman Grant Johnson, catcher Bruce Petway, and pitchers Frank Wickware and Pat Dougherty, Lloyd sparked the Lelands to a 123–6 record (with Foster himself contributing a 13–2 record on the mound).

==Chicago American Giants==

The following season, Foster established a partnership with white businessman John M. Schorling. The White Sox had just moved into Comiskey Park, and Schorling arranged for Foster&#x27;s team to use the vacated South Side Park, at 39th and Wentworth. Settling into their new home (now called Schorling&#x27;s Park), the Lelands became the Chicago American Giants. For the next four seasons, the American Giants claimed the western black baseball championship, though they lost a 1913 series to the Lincoln Giants for the national championship.

By 1915, Foster&#x27;s first serious rival in the midwest had emerged: C. I. Taylor&#x27;s Indianapolis ABCs, who claimed the western championship after defeating the American Giants four games to none in July. One of the victories was a forfeit called after a brawl between the two teams broke out. After the series, Foster and Taylor engaged in a public dispute about that game and the championship. In 1916, both teams again claimed the western title. The continued wrangling led to calls for a black baseball league to be formed, but Foster, Taylor, and the other major clubs in the midwest were unable to come to any agreement.

By this time, Foster was pitching very little, compiling only a 2–2 record in 1915. His last recorded outing on the mound was in 1917; from this time he became purely a bench manager. As a manager and team owner, Foster was a disciplinarian. He asserted control over every aspect of the game, and set a high standard for personal conduct, appearance, and professionalism among his players. Given Schorling Park&#x27;s huge dimensions, Foster developed a style of play that emphasized speed, bunting, place hitting, power pitching, and defense. He was also considered a great teacher, and many of his players themselves eventually became managers, including Pete Hill, Bruce Petway, Bingo DeMoss, Dave Malarcher, Sam Crawford, Poindexter Williams, and many others.

In 1919, Foster helped Tenny Blount finance a new club in Detroit, the Stars. He also transferred several of his veteran players there, including Hill, who was to manage the new team, and Petway. He may have been preparing the way for the formation, the following year, of the Negro National League (NNL).

==Negro National League==
In 1920, Foster, Taylor, and the owners of six other midwestern clubs met in the spring to form a professional baseball circuit for African-American teams. Foster, as president, controlled league operations, while remaining owner and manager of the American Giants. He was periodically accused of favoring his own team, especially in matters of scheduling (the Giants in the early years tended to have a disproportionate number of home games) and personnel: Foster seemed able to acquire whatever talent he needed from other clubs, such as Jimmie Lyons, the Detroit Stars&#x27; best player in 1920, who was transferred to the American Giants for 1921, or Foster&#x27;s own younger brother, Bill, who joined the American Giants unwillingly when Rube forced the Memphis Red Sox to give him up in 1926. His critics believed he had organized the league primarily for purposes of booking games for the American Giants. With a stable schedule and reasonably solvent opponents, Foster was able to improve receipts at the gate. It is also true that when opposing clubs lost money, he was known to help them meet payroll, sometimes out of his own pocket.

His American Giants won the new league&#x27;s first three pennants before being overtaken by the Kansas City Monarchs in 1923. In the same year the Hilldale Club and Bacharach Giants, the most important eastern clubs, pulled out of an agreement with the NNL and founded their own league, the Eastern Colored League (ECL). The ECL raided the older circuit for players, Foster&#x27;s own ace pitcher Dave Brown among them. Eventually the two leagues reached an agreement to respect one another&#x27;s contracts and to play a world series.

After two years of finishing behind the Monarchs, Foster &quot;cleaned house&quot; in spring 1925, releasing several veterans (including Lyons and pitchers Dick Whitworth and Tom Williams). On May 26, Foster was nearly asphyxiated by a gas leak in Indianapolis. Though he recovered and returned to his team, his behavior grew erratic from then on. Foster had instituted a split-season format, and his American Giants finished third in both halves.

The year 1926 saw him complete his team&#x27;s reshaping, leaving only a handful of veterans from the championship squads of 1920 to 1922. The club finished third in the season&#x27;s first half, but Foster would never finish the second. Over the years, &quot;Foster grew increasingly paranoid. Took to carrying a revolver with him everywhere he went.&quot; Suffering from serious delusions, including one where he believed he was about to receive a call to pitch in the World Series, he was institutionalized midway through the 1926 season at an asylum in Kankakee, Illinois.

The American Giants and the NNL lived on—in fact, led by Dave Malarcher, the Giants won the pennant and World Series in both 1926 and 1927—but the league clearly suffered in the absence of Foster&#x27;s leadership. Foster died in 1930, never having recovered his sanity, and a year later the league he had founded fell apart.

Foster is interred in Lincoln Cemetery in Blue Island, Illinois. Thousands attended his funeral in Bronzeville, Chicago, including &quot;an overflow crowd of 3,000 people who &#x27;stood in the snow and rain.&#x27; At his funeral, his coffin was closed, according to attendees, &quot;at the usual hour a ballgame ends.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 1981, Foster was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. He was the first representative of the Negro leagues elected as a pioneer or executive.

Around 1999, the City of Chicago included Foster in its Chicago Tribute series of historical markers around the city. A marker about Foster was erected at the corner of Pershing Road (39th Street) and Wentworth Avenue, next to the Wentworth Gardens housing complex, at the location of South Side Park, where Foster&#x27;s Giants played until 1941. The marker was still standing but faded and hard to read as of 2023.

On December 30, 2009, the U.S. Postal Service announced that it planned to issue a pair of postage stamps in June honoring Negro leagues Baseball. On July 17, 2010, the Postal Service issued a se-tenant pair of 44-cent, first-class, U.S. commemorative postage stamps, to honor the all-black professional baseball leagues that operated from 1920 to about 1960. One of the stamps depicts Foster, along with his name and the words &quot;NEGRO LEAGUES BASEBALL&quot;. The stamps were formally issued at the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, during the celebration of the museum&#x27;s twentieth anniversary.

The Negro Leagues Baseball Museum hosts the annual Andrew &quot;Rube&quot; Foster Lecture, in September.

In 2021, Rube Foster was posthumously inducted into the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame.

On November 10, 2021, the United States Mint announced the designs for the 2022 Negro Leagues Centennial Commemorative coins, with Foster featured on the $5 gold half eagle.

<text>Ringgold Wilmer Lardner (March 6, 1885 – September 25, 1933) was an American sports columnist and short story writer best known for his satirical writings on sports, marriage, and the theatre. His contemporaries—Ernest Hemingway, Virginia Woolf, and F. Scott Fitzgerald—all professed strong admiration for his writing, and author John O&#x27;Hara directly attributed his understanding of dialogue to him.

==Early life==
Ring Lardner was born in Niles, Michigan, the son of wealthy parents, Henry and Lena Phillips Lardner. He was the youngest of nine children. Lardner&#x27;s name came from a cousin of the same name. The cousin had been named by Lardner&#x27;s uncle, Rear Admiral James L. Lardner, who had decided to name his son after a friend, Rear Admiral Cadwalader Ringgold, who was from a distinguished military family. Lardner never liked his given name and abbreviated it to Ring, although he named one of his sons Ringgold Jr.

In childhood he wore a brace for his deformed foot until he was eleven. He had a passion for baseball, stage, and music. He later attended the Armour Institute in Chicago.

==Career==
=== Syndicated writing ===
Lardner started his writing career as a sports columnist, finding work with the newspaper &quot;South Bend Times&quot; in 1905. In 1907, he relocated to Chicago, where he got a job with the &quot; Inter-Ocean&quot;. Within a year, he quit to work for the &quot;Chicago Examiner&quot;, and then for the &quot;Tribune&quot;. Two years later, Lardner was in St. Louis, writing the humorous baseball column &quot;Pullman Pastimes&quot; for Taylor Spink and the &quot;Sporting News&quot;. Some of this work was the basis for his book &quot;You Know Me Al&quot;. Within three months, he was an employee of the &quot;Boston American&quot;.

In 1913, Lardner returned to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, which became the home newspaper for his syndicated column &quot;In the Wake of the News&quot; (started by Hugh Keough, who had died in 1912). The column appeared in more than 100 newspapers, and is still published in the &quot;Tribune&quot;. Lardner&#x27;s &quot;Tribune&quot; and syndicated writing was not exclusively sports-related: his dispatches from/near the World War One front were collected in the book &quot;My Four Weeks in France&quot;, and his immersive coverage of the 1920 Democratic Convention resulted in Lardner receiving 0.5 votes on the 23rd ballot.

=== Books and stories ===
In 1916, Lardner published his first successful book, &quot;You Know Me Al&quot;, an epistolary novel written in the form of letters by &quot;Jack Keefe&quot;, a bush-league baseball player, to a friend back home. The letters made much use of the fictional author&#x27;s idiosyncratic vernacular. It had initially been published as six separate but interrelated short stories in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, causing some to classify the book as a collection of stories, others as a novel. Like most of Lardner&#x27;s stories, &quot;You Know Me Al&quot; employs satire.

Journalist Andrew Ferguson wrote that &quot;Ring Lardner thought of himself as primarily a sports columnist whose stuff wasn&#x27;t destined to last, and he held to that absurd belief even after his first masterpiece, &quot;You Know Me Al&quot;, was published in 1916 and earned the awed appreciation of Virginia Woolf, among other very serious, unfunny people.&quot; Ferguson termed the book one of the top five pieces of American humor writing.

Sarah Bembrey has written about a singular event in Lardner&#x27;s sportswriting experience: &quot;In 1919 something happened that changed his way of reporting about sports and changed his love for baseball. This was the Black Sox scandal when the Chicago White Sox sold out the World Series to the Cincinnati Reds. Ring was exceptionally close to the White Sox and felt he was betrayed by the team. After the scandal, Ring always wrote about sports as if there were some kink to the outcome.&quot; Lardner&#x27;s last fictional baseball writing was collected in the book &quot;Lose with a Smile&quot; (1933).

Lardner later published such stories as &quot;Haircut&quot;, &quot;Some Like Them Cold&quot;, &quot;The Golden Honeymoon&quot;, &quot;Alibi Ike&quot;, and &quot;A Day with Conrad Green&quot;. He also continued to write follow-up stories to &quot;You Know Me Al&quot;, with the protagonist of that book, the headstrong, egotistical but gullible Jack Keefe, experiencing various ups and downs in his major league career and in his personal life. Private Keefe&#x27;s World War I training camp letters home to his friend Al were collected in the book &quot;Treat &#x27;Em Rough: Letters From Jack the Kaiser Killer&quot;. The sequel, &quot;The Real Dope&quot;, followed Keefe overseas to the trenches in France. He then returned home to pitch for the 1919 Chicago White Sox, but the sequence of stories closed with Keefe being traded to the Philadelphia A&#x27;s before the 1919 World Series -- Jack Keefe, whatever his flaws, would not be involved in the Black Sox scandal. Lardner returned to the character when he wrote the continuity for a daily &quot;You Know Me Al&quot; comic strip that ran from 1922 to 1925.

=== Theatre and music ===
Lardner also had a lifelong fascination with the theatre, although his only Broadway three-act successes were the thrice-filmed &quot;Elmer, the Great&quot;, co-written with George M. Cohan, and &quot;June Moon&quot;, a comedy authored with Broadway veteran George S. Kaufman. Lardner also wrote skits for the Ziegfeld Follies and a series of brief nonsense plays that ridiculed the conventions of the theatre, using zany humor and outrageous, impossible stage directions, such as &quot;The curtain is lowered for seven days to denote the lapse of a week.&quot;

He was a dedicated composer and lyricist: both his first (&quot;Zanzibar&quot; (1903)) and last (&quot;June Moon&quot; (1929)) published stage works included several Lardner tunes. He wrote at least one recorded song for Bert Williams, co-wrote one for Nora Bayes, and provided the lyrics for the song &quot;That Old Quartet&quot; (1913) by Nathaniel D. Mann. Other collaborators of note included Aubrey Stauffer, Jerome Kern on &quot;Very Good Eddie&quot; (1915), and Vincent Youmans—with whom he toiled on the Ziegfeld–Marilyn Miller–Asstores musical &quot;Smiles&quot; (1930).

== Legacy ==
Lardner&#x27;s books were published by Maxwell Perkins, who also edited Lardner&#x27;s most important contemporaries, including Fitzgerald who, unlike Hemingway, also became Lardner&#x27;s friend. Although Lardner held his own short stories in low regard—he did not save copies and had to get them from the magazines that had first published them to compile a book—Lardner influenced several of his more famous peers:

* In some respects, Lardner was the model for the tragic character Abe North in Fitzgerald&#x27;s last completed novel, &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot;.
* Lardner also influenced Ernest Hemingway, who sometimes wrote articles for his high school newspaper using the pseudonym Ring Lardner, Jr.
* Lardner&#x27;s gift for dialogue heavily influenced the writer John O&#x27;Hara, who said he learned from reading Lardner &quot;that if you wrote down speech as it is spoken truly, you produce true characters, and the opposite is also true: if your characters don&#x27;t talk like people they aren&#x27;t good characters&quot; and added, &quot;[I]t&#x27;s the attribute most lacking in American writers and almost totally lacking in the British.&quot;

==Cultural references==

* J. D. Salinger referred to Lardner in two of his works,&quot; The Catcher in the Rye&quot; and &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot;. In the former work, protagonist Holden Caulfield says: &quot;My favorite author is my brother D.B. and my next favorite is Ring Lardner&quot;.
* Wayne C. Booth mentioned Lardner&#x27;s famous short story &quot;Haircut&quot; in his essay &quot;Telling and Showing.&quot;
* In his movie &quot;Eight Men Out&quot; (1988) about the Black Sox scandal, writer-director John Sayles portrayed Lardner as one of the clear-eyed observers who was not taken in by the conspiracy. In one scene, Lardner strolls through the White Sox train, singing a parody of the song &quot;I&#x27;m Forever Blowing Bubbles,&quot; changed to &quot;I&#x27;m Forever Throwing Ballgames.&quot;
* The Chicago Literary Hall of Fame inducted Lardner in 2016.
* Harry Turtledove describes his short story &quot;Batboy&quot; as a Ring Lardner pastiche.
* Neil Simon references Ring Lardner in his play &quot;Brighton Beach Memoirs&quot;.
* In John DeChancie&#x27;s novel &quot;Castle for Rent,&quot; Lord Incarnadine mentions having been friends with Ring Lardner.
* In Sam Halpert&#x27;s semi-autobiographical novel about a navigator in the 91st Bomb Group, &quot;A Real Good War&quot; (1997), the narrator mentions reading Lardner, and specifically refers to &quot;Haircut&quot;.

==Personal life==
Lardner married Ellis Abbott of Goshen, Indiana, in 1911. They had four sons who each became writers. John Lardner, born in 1912, was a newspaperman, sports columnist, and magazine writer. Ring&#x27;s second born, James Lardner, worked as a newspaperman before he was killed in the Spanish Civil War fighting with the International Brigades. In 1939, James was remembered with the book &quot;Somebody Had to Do Something. A Memorial to James Phillips Lardner&quot;, a book that printed 500-copies. It was financed by the James Lardner Memorial Fund and featured contributions by Ernest Hemingway, Ring Lardner, Jr., Jay Allen, Don Jesus Hernandez, El Campesino, Dolores Ibarruri, Vincent Sheean and drawings by Castelao. Ring Lardner&#x27;s third son, Ring Lardner Jr., was an Academy Award-winning screenwriter who was blacklisted after the Second World War as one of the Hollywood Ten, screenwriters who were incarcerated for contempt of Congress after refusing to answer questions posed by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). His book, &quot;The Lardners, My Family Remembered&quot; (), is a source of information on his father. The youngest, David Lardner, worked for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; as a general reporter and war correspondent before he was killed by a landmine near Aachen, Germany on October 19, 1944, less than one month after his arrival in Europe.

Lardner died on September 25, 1933, at the age of 48 in East Hampton, New York, of a heart attack due to complications from tuberculosis.

Lardner&#x27;s grand-nephew is George Lardner Jr., a journalist at &quot;The Washington Post&quot; from 1963 and a 1993 Pulitzer Prize winner.

<doc id="26417" wikidata="Q19721" url="?curid=26417" title="River Clyde">
<text>The River Clyde (, ) is a river that flows into the Firth of Clyde, in the west of Scotland. It is the ninth-longest river in the United Kingdom, and the third longest in Scotland after the River Tay and the River Spey. It runs through the city of Glasgow. The River Clyde estuary has an upper tidal limit located at the tidal weir next to Glasgow Green.

Historically, it was important to the British Empire because of its role in shipbuilding and trade. To the Romans, it was , and in the early medieval Cumbric language, it was known as or . It was central to the Kingdom of Strathclyde ().

== Etymology ==
The exact etymology of the river&#x27;s name is unclear, though it is known that the name is ancient. In 50AD, the Egyptian mathematician, astronomer and geographer Claudius Ptolemy wrote of the river as &quot;Klōta&quot;, It was called or by the Britons and by the Romans. It is therefore likely that the name comes from a Celtic language—most likely Old British. But there is more than one old Celtic word that the river&#x27;s name could plausibly derive from. One possible root is the Common Brittonic , meaning &#x27;loud&#x27; or &#x27;loudly&#x27;. More likely, the river was named after a local Celtic goddess, &quot;Clōta&quot;. The goddess&#x27;s name in turn derives from an older, Proto-Celtic word meaning &#x27;the strongly flowing one&#x27; or &#x27;the holy cleanser&#x27;.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
Humans have settled along the Clyde since the Paleolithic era. Artifacts dating from 12,000 BC have been found near Biggar, a rural town close to the river. Biggar is home to an archeological site at which Britain&#x27;s most ancient artifacts have been unearthed. Prehistoric canoes, used by ancient peoples for transport or trade, have been found in the river. There are a number of Mesolithic sites along the Clyde, especially in the Upper Clyde Valley. Permanent settlements and structures, including what is believed to be a temple to moon gods in Govan, were constructed in the area during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Celtic art, language, and other aspects of culture began spreading to the area from the south during this period, and prehistoric artifacts suggest that, by around 1000 BCE, they had become the dominant cultural influences there.

=== Ancient history ===
Before the legions of the Roman Empire arrived in southern Scotland, the river and the area surrounding it had been settled by the Brythonic-speaking Damnonii tribe. It has been suggested that a Damnonii town called &quot;Cathures&quot; was located there and was the precursor to modern Glasgow. The Damnonii tribe originally likely distributed power among individual chiefdoms, but at some point before 500 AD the political framework was a British culture of Welsh speakers that was politically unified and formed a centralised kingdom known as Alt Clut, representing the power centre at Dunbarton Rock.

None of the documentary or archaeological evidence from the period when the Roman legions arrived suggests that battles took place in the area. Therefore the Roman legions and Damnonii tribespeople are assumed to have been on good terms and to have co-operated by means of trade and the exchange of military information. The Romans did, however, construct several forts () in the area, notably on the banks of the Clyde. These include Castledykes, Bothwellhaugh, and Old Kilpatrick and Bishopton. The Romans also constructed several roads along the river, both small ones and larger ones designed to be used as trade routes and to carry entire legions. The Antonine Wall, which lies only a few miles from the river, was constructed later by the Romans as a means of defending the area against invasion by the Picts. Despite the strategic location and flat terrain of Glasgow and the surrounding Clyde basin, no Roman civilian settlement was ever constructed. Instead, the region may have functioned as a frontier zone between the Roman province known as Britannia Inferior and the Caledonians, an indigenous group that was hostile to the Romans.

=== Kingdom of Strathclyde ===
Strathclyde was founded as an independent unified British kingdom, quite some centuries after the Roman occupation of Britain. The kingdom&#x27;s core territory and much of its arable land was located around the Clyde basin in the area traditionally associated with Alt Clut. The kingdom was ruled from its original capital, the near impenetrable Alt Clut fortress (Dumbarton Rock), which was situated on the river and overlooked much of the estuary. This fortress was noteworthy enough to have been referred to at the time in several letters and poems about Sub-Roman Britain, written by Gildas and others. Strathclyde remained a powerful kingdom during the early medieval period in Britain. It was also a reservoir of native Welsh culture: Its territory expanded along the Clyde Vae Southern Uplands and Ayrshire, and eventually southwards into Cumbria. 

In the 7th century, Saint Mungo established a new Christian community on the banks of the Clyde, potentially replacing Cathures if this is assumed to have occupied the same locus. This community was the beginnings of what would become the city of Glasgow. Several villages along the Clyde that were founded in or before this period have endured to this day, and have grown to become towns, including &quot;Llanerc&quot; (Lanark), &quot;Cadzow&quot; (Hamilton), and &quot;Rhynfrwd&quot; (Renfrew). The fortress of Altclut fell in the Siege of Dumbarton of 870 AD, when a force of Norse-Irish raiders from the Kingdom of Dublin sacked it. After that, the kingdom, now politically weakened, possibly moved its capital to Govan. However, it never fully recovered, and in the 11th century it was annexed by the Kingdom of Alba. It did however retain some autonomy under the Church of Glasgow, which became the secular successors of much of the territory when it was treated as a Principality of the Scottish Crown.

=== Medieval and early modern history ===
In the 13th century, Glasgow, then still a small town, built its first bridge over the river Clyde. This was an important step in its ability to eventually grow into a city. The establishment, in the 15th century, of both the University of Glasgow and the Archdiocese of Glasgow, vastly increased the importance of the town within Scotland. From the early modern period onwards, the Clyde began to be used commercially as a trade route; trade between Glasgow and the rest of Europe became commonplace. In the centuries that followed, the Clyde became increasingly vital to both Scotland and Britain as a major trade route for exporting and importing resources.

===Port authority===

The was initially formed in 1840 by the &#x27; (3 &amp; 4 Vict. c. cxviii), and then reconstituted under the &#x27; (21 &amp; 22 Vict. c. cxlix). The (c. xlv) replaced the Clyde Navigation Trust with the Clyde Port Authority from 1 January 1966, which has since been renamed to &#x27;Clydeport&#x27;, and was privatisated in 1992. In 2003 it was acquired by Peel Holdings.

== Course ==
The Clyde is formed by the confluence of two streams, the Daer Water (the headwaters of which are dammed to form the Daer Reservoir) and the Potrail Water. The Southern Upland Way crosses both streams before they meet at Watermeetings () to form the River Clyde proper. At this point, the Clyde is only from Tweed&#x27;s Well, the source of the River Tweed, and is about the same distance from Annanhead Hill, the source of the River Annan. From there, it meanders northeastward before turning to the west, where its flood plain serve as the site of many major roads in the area, then reaches the town of Lanark, where the late 17th- and early 18th-century industrialists David Dale and Robert Owen built mills and the model settlement of New Lanark on the banks of the Clyde. The mills harnessed the power of the Falls of Clyde, the most spectacular of which is Cora Linn. A hydroelectric power station still generates 11MW of electricity there today, although the mills have now become a museum and World Heritage Site.

The river then makes its way northwest, past the towns of Wishaw to the east of it and Larkhall to the west of it. The river&#x27;s surroundings here become increasingly suburban. Between the towns of Motherwell and Hamilton, the course of the river has been altered to create an artificial loch within Strathclyde Park. Part of the original course can still be seen: It lies between the island and the eastern shore of the loch. The river then flows through Blantyre and Bothwell, where the ruined Bothwell Castle stands on a defensible promontory.

As it flows past Uddingston and into the southeastern part of Glasgow, the river begins to widen, meandering through Cambuslang, Rutherglen, and Dalmarnock, and past Glasgow Green. From the Tidal Weir westwards, the river is tidal: a mix of fresh and salt water.

Over three centuries the river has been engineered and widened where it passes through Glasgow city centre and onwards towards Dumbarton and Greenock and the open sea. Shipping and shipbuilding grow in Glasgow and its neighbouring industrial burghs of Govan and Partick; with the Clyde, including is lower reaches, becoming the centre of world shipbuilding. 

The river then flows west, out of Glasgow, past Renfrew, under the Erskine Bridge, and past Dumbarton on the northern shore and the sandbank at Ardmore Point between Cardross and Helensburgh. Opposite, on the southern shore, is the last remaining Lower Clyde shipyard, at Port Glasgow. The river continues on to Greenock, where it reaches the Tail of the Bank as the river merges into the Firth of Clyde. Here at the mouth of the Clyde, there is currently a significant ecological problem of oxygen depletion in the water column.

== Industrial growth ==

The economic prosperity that the Clyde made possible at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution was due to the location of Glasgow, as a port facing the Americas. Tobacco and cotton trade began to drive this economic engine in the early 18th century. However, an obstacle to further economic growth soon became evident: the Clyde was too shallow for the largest ocean-going ships to navigate into it, so cargo had to be transferred, at Greenock or Port Glasgow, to smaller ships that could sail upstream into Glasgow itself.

=== Deepening the Upper Clyde ===
In 1768, John Golborne advised that the river should be made narrower and the scour increased by constructing rubble jetties and dredging sandbanks and shoals. Another obstacle to navigation that had to be solved was that the river divided into two shallow channels by the Dumbuck shoal near Dumbarton. After James Watt&#x27;s 1769 report describing this problem, a jetty was constructed at Longhaugh Point to block off the southern channel. This turned out to be insufficient to solve the problem, so in 1773, a training wall called the Lang Dyke was built on the Dumbuck shoal to stop water flowing over into the southern channel of the river.

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, hundreds of jetties were built out from the banks of the river between Dumbuck and the Broomielaw quay in Glasgow proper. In some cases, this construction had the effect of deepening the river, because the increased flow of the newly constrained water wore away the river bottom. In other cases, dredging was required to deepen the river.

In the mid-19th century, engineers took on the task of dredging the Clyde much more extensively. They removed millions of cubic feet of silt to deepen and widen the channel. The major stumbling block encountered by that project was a massive geological intrusion known as Elderslie Rock. Because that rock increased the project&#x27;s difficulty, the work was not completed until the 1880s. Around this time, the Clyde became an important source of inspiration for artists, such as John Atkinson Grimshaw and James Kay, who were interested in painting scenes that depicted the new industrial era and the modern world.

=== Shipbuilding and marine engineering ===

The completion of the dredging was well-timed, because the channel finally became navigable all the way from Greenock to Glasgow just when the steelwork industry had begun to grow in the city. Shipbuilding replaced trade as the major activity on the river, and shipbuilding companies started rapidly establishing themselves there. The Clyde soon gained a reputation for being the best location for shipbuilding in the British Empire, and grew to become the world&#x27;s pre-eminent shipbuilding centre. The term &quot;Clydebuilt&quot; became an industry symbol of high quality, and the river&#x27;s shipyards were given contracts to build prestigious ocean-going liners, as well as warships. The &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and, in later years, the &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; were built in the town of Clydebank.

Between 1712, when the Scott family&#x27;s shipyard was built at Greenock, and the present day, over 25,000 ships have been built on the River Clyde, its firth, and its tributaries, the River Kelvin and the River Cart, by many boatyards, including those at Maryhill and Kirkintilloch on the Forth &amp; Clyde Canal, and Blackhill on the Monkland Canal. Over the same time period, it is estimated that more than 300 firms have engaged in shipbuilding on Clydeside, although probably at most 30 to 40 firms were operating at any given time.

The shipbuilding firms became household names on Clydeside, and even around the world to some extent. These included, among many others, John Brown &amp; Company of Clydebank, Denny of Dumbarton, Scott of Greenock, Lithgows of Port Glasgow, Simon and Lobnitz of Renfrew, Alexander Stephen &amp; Sons of Linthouse, Fairfield of Govan, Inglis of Pointhouse, Barclay Curle of Whiteinch, Connell and Yarrow of Scotstoun. Almost as famous were the engineering firms that supplied the machinery needed to drive these vessels, including the boilers, pumps, and steering gear, including Rankin &amp; Blackmore, Hastie&#x27;s and Kincaid&#x27;s of Greenock, Rowan&#x27;s of Finnieston, Weir&#x27;s of Cathcart, Howden&#x27;s of Tradeston, and Babcock &amp; Wilcox of Renfrew.

One shipyard that was known as a &#x27;Clyde&#x27; shipyard was not actually located on any of the Clyde&#x27;s waterways: Alley &amp; MacLellan&#x27;s Sentinel Works in Jessie Street at Polmadie is around half a mile distant from the Clyde. It is said to have constructed over 500 vessels, many of which were assembled and then &#x27;knocked down&#x27; to kit form for despatch to a remote location, such as &quot;Chauncy Maples&quot;. Clyde shipbuilding reached its peak in the years just before World War I: It is estimated that, in the year 1913 alone, over 370 ships were completed.

== Yachting and yachtbuilding ==
The first recorded Clyde racing yacht, a 46-ton cutter, was built by Scotts of Greenock in 1803. The pre-eminent Scottish yacht designer William Fyfe did not start designing yachts until 1807. The first yacht club on the Clyde was the Northern Yacht Club, which was established in 1824 and received its royal charter in 1831. The club was founded to organise and encourage the sport of yacht racing. By 1825, Scottish and Irish clubs were racing against each other on the Clyde. By the mid-19th century, yachting and yacht building had become widely popular.

The Clyde became famous worldwide for its significant contribution to yachting and yachtbuilding, and was the home of many notable designers: William Fife III, Alfred Mylne, G. L. Watson, E. McGruer, and David Boyd. It was also home to many famous yacht yards.

Robertson&#x27;s Yard started repairing boats in a small workshop at Sandbank in 1876, and went on to become one of the foremost wooden boat builders on the Clyde. The &#x27;golden years&#x27; of Robertson&#x27;s yard were in the early 20th century, when they started building classic racing yachts. More than 55 boats were built by Robertson&#x27;s in preparation for World War I, and the yard remained busy even during the Great Depression in the 1930s, as many wealthy businessmen developed a passion for yacht racing on the Clyde. During World War II, the yard was devoted to Admiralty work, producing large, high-speed Fairmile Marine motor boats (motor torpedo boats and motor gun boats). After the war, the yard built the successful one-class Loch Longs and two challengers for the America&#x27;s Cup, designed by David Boyd: &quot;Sceptre&quot; (1958) and &quot;Sovereign&quot; (1964). Because of difficult business conditions in 1965, the yard turned to doing GRP production work (mainly building Pipers and Etchells), and it closed in 1980. During its 104-year history, Robertson&#x27;s Yard built 500 boats, many of which are still sailing today.

Two other notable boatyards on the Clyde were Silvers, which operated from 1910 to 1970, and McGruers, which operated from 1910 to 1973. They were situated on the Rosneath peninsula on the banks of the Gare Loch, within half a mile of each other. McGruers built over 700 boats. Both yards built many widely-known and classic yachts, some of which are still sailing today.

== Glasgow Humane Society ==

The Glasgow Humane Society is responsible for the safety and preservation of life on Glasgow&#x27;s waterways. Founded in 1790, it is the oldest lifesaving organisation in the world.

== Shipbuilding decline ==
During and immediately after World War II, the Clyde&#x27;s importance as a major industrial centre rapidly declined. During the war, the Luftwaffe singled out Clydebank for bombing, and its buildings sustained heavy damage. In the immediate postwar period, the sharp reduction in warship orders was initially balanced by a prolonged boom in merchant shipbuilding. But by the end of the 1950s, other countries had begun to establish well-capitalised and highly productive shipbuilding centres that were able to outcompete many of the European shipbuilding yards. Several Clydeside yards booked a series of loss-making contracts in the hope of weathering the storm, but their unprofitable circumstances continued for too long, and by the mid-1960s they faced potential collapse. Harland and Wolff&#x27;s Linthouse yard went under, and Fairfields of Govan faced bankruptcy. The government tried to limit the decline by creating the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders consortium, but the consortium became mired in controversy and collapsed in 1971. After that, James Callaghan&#x27;s Labour government implemented the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977 (c. 3), which nationalised most of the Clyde&#x27;s shipyards and grouped them with other major British shipyards, such as the firm British Shipbuilders.

Today, two major shipyards on the Upper Clyde remain in operation. They are both owned by a naval defence contractor, BAE Systems Surface Ships, which specialises in the design and construction of technologically advanced warships for the Royal Navy and other navies around the world. The two yards are the former Yarrow yard at Scotstoun, and Fairfields at Govan. In addition, the King George V Dock is operated by the Clyde Port Authority. Ferguson Shipbuilders, at Port Glasgow on the Lower Clyde, is now owned by the Scottish government. It is the last survivor of the many shipyards that once dominated Port Glasgow and Greenock. Its core business is now the construction of car ferries.

== Regeneration ==
Major regeneration schemes include those in the 1970s of forming Strathclyde Country Park, lying between Hamilton and Motherwell, as part of motorway developments; the establishment of the Glasgow Garden Festival 1988 as part of the re-use of city docklands and associated industrial uses led by the Scottish Development Agency in the 1980s and early 90s. 
The Clyde Waterfront Regeneration project from 2008 aims to continue this approach of finding new uses and attracting new investment, from Glasgow Green to Dumbarton. Residents and tourists come back to the riverside, especially in Glasgow, where vast former docklands have given way to housing and amenities on the banks in the city. Examples of public amenities and attractions include the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, the Glasgow Science Centre, and the Riverside Museum. Merchant shipping has largely moved west, closer to deeper water at Greenock, and 20 miles beyond that, south, to Hunterston. The river&#x27;s water is increasingly used for recreation now that industrial uses have diminished.

The Clyde Walkway, originating at Glasgow&#x27;s Custom House Quay in the 1970s, and completed eastward in 2005, is a foot-and mountain-bike path that follows the course of the Clyde between Glasgow and New Lanark. Scottish Natural Heritage has designated it one of Scotland&#x27;s Great Trails.

== Pollution ==
The British Geological Survey has identified and evaluated organic chemical pollutants in the sediment of the Clyde estuary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chemical Signatures of the Anthropocene in the Clyde Estuary, UK: Sediment hosted Pb, 207/206Pb, Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) and Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) Pollution Records.&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Surface sediments from the Glasgow reaches of the Clyde and Cuningar to Milton, were previously found to contain polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) from 630 μg/kg to 23,711 μg/kg and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) in the range of 5 to 130.5 μg/kg, which puts these sediments in the range classified as &quot;non-toxic.&quot; However, a later study showed PCB concentrations as high as 5,797 μg/kg, which is above published threshold levels for such chlorinated compounds. A comparison between individual PAH compounds that have different thermal stabilities shows that the source of PAH pollution in the Clyde is different in different parts of the river. PAH in the inner Clyde (Cuningar to Milton) are from combustion sources (vehicle exhaust, coal burning), whereas PAH in the outer Clyde are from petroleum spills.

The amount and type of sedimentary pollution in the Clyde reflects the area&#x27;s industrial history. In order to assess how the nature of the pollutants has changed over time, from 1750 to 2002, seven sediment cores of one metre&#x27;s depth were collected, and dated using lead concentrations and changing lead isotope ratios. The sediments showed a long but declining history of coal usage and, beginning around the 1950s, an increasing reliance on petroleum fuels. The decline of hydrocarbon pollution was followed by the appearance of PCB concentrations in the 1950s. Total PCB concentration levels peaked in the period 1965 to 1977, and declined beginning in the 1990s. The Polmadie Burn, which flows into the Clyde at Richmond Park, remains heavily contaminated by hexavalent chromium, to the extent it turned bright green in 2019, and yellow in 2021.

Although pollution from heavy industry and power generation has been decreasing, there is evidence that human-made pollution from new synthetic compounds in electrical products and textiles has been increasing. The amounts of 16 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) compounds used as flame retardants in televisions, computers, and furniture upholstery were measured in sediment cores collected from six sites between Princes Dock and Greenock. Comparison of the amounts of PBDE compounds revealed a decline in certain compounds, in line with the European ban on production of mixtures containing environmentally harmful PBDE with eight and nine bromine atoms. At the same time, there was an increase in the amounts of the less harmful mixture, composed of ten bromine atoms.

== Heat pumps ==
The River Clyde, or more accurately the Clyde Estuary, has significant potential as a heat source. The flow rate downstream alone is around 50 m3/s. Reducing this temperature by 3 °C would enable river heat pumps to extract 188.1 MW of heat. Since river heat pumps typically have an efficiency of 3.0, the heat deliverable is 1.5 times the river component. As a result, the estuary could deliver 282 MW of heat. The temperature of industrial heat pump delivery is typically 80 °C. 

In 2020, West Dunbartonshire Council deployed a river source heat pump scheme in the area called Queens Quay. It is the first large heat pump scheme in Britain to deliver at 80 °C. The heat pumps were supplied by Star Refrigeration Ltd, who manufactured them in their Glasgow factory. The project was delivered by Vital Energi.

<text>In algebra, the rational root theorem (or rational root test, rational zero theorem, rational zero test or theorem) states a constraint on rational solutions of a polynomial equation
formula_1
with integer coefficients formula_2 and formula_3. Solutions of the equation are also called roots or zeros of the polynomial on the left side.

The theorem states that each rational solution , written in lowest terms so that and are relatively prime, satisfies:
* is an integer factor of the constant term , and
* is an integer factor of the leading coefficient .

The rational root theorem is a special case (for a single linear factor) of Gauss&#x27;s lemma on the factorization of polynomials. The integral root theorem is the special case of the rational root theorem when the leading coefficient is .

==Application==

The theorem is used to find all rational roots of a polynomial, if any. It gives a finite number of possible fractions which can be checked to see if they are roots. If a rational root is found, a linear polynomial can be factored out of the polynomial using polynomial long division, resulting in a polynomial of lower degree whose roots are also roots of the original polynomial.

===Cubic equation===

The general cubic equation
formula_4
with integer coefficients has three solutions in the complex plane. If the rational root test finds no rational solutions, then the only way to express the solutions algebraically uses cube roots. But if the test finds a rational solution , then factoring out leaves a quadratic polynomial whose two roots, found with the quadratic formula, are the remaining two roots of the cubic, avoiding cube roots.

==Proofs==

===Elementary proof===

Let formula_5 with formula_6 

Suppose for some coprime :
formula_7

To clear denominators, multiply both sides by : 
formula_8

Shifting the term to the right side and factoring out on the left side produces:
formula_9

Thus, divides . But is coprime to and therefore to , so by Euclid&#x27;s lemma must divide the remaining factor .

On the other hand, shifting the term to the right side and factoring out on the left side produces:
formula_10

Reasoning as before, it follows that divides .

=== Proof using Gauss&#x27;s lemma ===

Should there be a nontrivial factor dividing all the coefficients of the polynomial, then one can divide by the greatest common divisor of the coefficients so as to obtain a primitive polynomial in the sense of Gauss&#x27;s lemma; this does not alter the set of rational roots and only strengthens the divisibility conditions. That lemma says that if the polynomial factors in , then it also factors in as a product of primitive polynomials. Now any rational root corresponds to a factor of degree 1 in of the polynomial, and its primitive representative is then , assuming that and are coprime. But any multiple in of has leading term divisible by and constant term divisible by , which proves the statement. This argument shows that more generally, any irreducible factor of can be supposed to have integer coefficients, and leading and constant coefficients dividing the corresponding coefficients of .

==Examples==

===First===

In the polynomial
formula_11
any rational root fully reduced should have a numerator that divides 1 and a denominator that divides 2. Hence the only possible rational roots are ±1/2 and ±1; since neither of these equates the polynomial to zero, it has no rational roots.

===Second===
In the polynomial
formula_12
the only possible rational roots would have a numerator that divides 6 and a denominator that divides 1, limiting the possibilities to ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6. Of these, 1, 2, and –3 equate the polynomial to zero, and hence are its rational roots (in fact these are its only roots since a cubic polynomial has only three roots).

===Third===

Every rational root of the polynomial
formula_13
must be one of the 8 numbers
formula_14
These 8 possible values for can be tested by evaluating the polynomial. It turns out there is exactly one rational root, which is formula_15 

However, these eight computations may be rather tedious, and some tricks allow to avoid some of them.

Firstly, if formula_16 all terms of become negative, and their sum cannot be 0; so, every root is positive, and a rational root must be one of the four values formula_17

One has formula_18 So, is not a root. Moreover, if one sets , one gets without computation that formula_19 is a polynomial in with the same first coefficient and constant term . The rational root theorem implies thus that a rational root of must belong to formula_20 and thus that the rational roots of satisfy formula_21 This shows again that any rational root of is positive, and the only remaining candidates are and .

To show that is not a root, it suffices to remark that if formula_22 then formula_23 and formula_24 are multiples of , while formula_25 is not. So, their sum cannot be zero.

Finally, only formula_26 needs to be computed to verify that it is a root of the polynomial.

<text>The Round Table (; ; ; ) is King Arthur&#x27;s famed table in the Arthurian legend, around which he and his knights congregate. As its name suggests, it has no head, implying that everyone who sits there has equal status, unlike conventional rectangular tables where participants order themselves according to rank. The table was first described in 1155 by Wace, who relied on previous depictions of Arthur&#x27;s fabulous retinue. The symbolism of the Round Table developed over time; by the close of the 12th century, it had come to represent the chivalric order associated with Arthur&#x27;s court, the Knights of the Round Table.

==Origins==
Though the Round Table is not mentioned in the earliest accounts, tales of King Arthur having a marvellous court made up of many prominent warriors are ancient. Geoffrey of Monmouth, in his &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (composed c. 1136) says that, after establishing peace throughout Britain, Arthur &quot;increased his personal entourage by inviting very distinguished men from far-distant kingdoms to join it.&quot; The code of chivalry so important in later medieval romance figures in it as well, as Geoffrey says Arthur established &quot;such a code of courtliness in his household that he inspired peoples living far away to imitate him.&quot; 

Arthur&#x27;s court was well known to Welsh storytellers; in the romance &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, the protagonist Culhwch invokes the names of 225 individuals affiliated with Arthur. The fame of Arthur&#x27;s entourage became so prominent in Welsh tradition that in the later additions to the Welsh Triads, the formula tying named individuals to &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; in the triad titles began to supersede the older &quot;Island of Britain&quot; formula. Though the code of chivalry crucial to later continental romances dealing with the Round Table is mostly absent from the Welsh material, some passages of &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; seem to reference it. For instance, Arthur explains the ethos of his court, saying &quot;[w]e are nobles as long as we are sought out: the greater the bounty we may give, the greater our nobility, fame and honour.&quot;

Though no Round Table appears in the early Welsh texts, Arthur is associated with various items of household furniture. The earliest of these is Saint Carannog&#x27;s mystical floating altar in that saint&#x27;s 12th-century &quot;Vita&quot;. In the story Arthur has found the altar and tries unsuccessfully to use it as a table; he returns it to Carannog in exchange for the saint ridding the land of a meddlesome dragon. Elements of Arthur&#x27;s household figure into local topographical folklore throughout Britain as early as the early 12th century, with various landmarks being named &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Seat&quot;, &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Oven&quot;, and &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Bed-chamber&quot;. 

A henge at Eamont Bridge near Penrith, Cumbria, is known as &quot;King Arthur&#x27;s Round Table&quot;. The still-visible Roman amphitheatre at Caerleon has been associated with the Round Table, and it has been suggested as a possible source for the legend. Following archaeological discoveries at the Roman ruins in Chester, some writers suggested that the Chester Roman Amphitheatre was the true prototype of the Round Table; however, the English Heritage Commission, acting as consultants to a History Channel documentary in which the claim was made, stated that there was no archaeological basis to the story.

==Legend==
The Round Table first appeared in Wace&#x27;s &quot;Roman de Brut&quot;, a Norman language adaptation of Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot; finished in 1155. Wace says Arthur created the Round Table to prevent quarrels among his barons, none of whom would accept a lower place than the others. Layamon added to the story when he adapted Wace&#x27;s work into the Middle English &quot;Brut&quot; in the early 13th century, saying that the quarrel between Arthur&#x27;s vassals led to violence at a Yuletide feast. In response, a Cornish carpenter built an enormous but easily transportable Round Table to prevent further dispute. Wace claims he was not the source of the Round Table; both he and Layamon credited it instead to the Bretons. Some scholars have doubted this claim, while others believe it may be true. There is some similarity between the chroniclers&#x27; description of the Round Table and a custom recorded in Celtic stories, in which warriors sit in a circle around the king or lead warrior, in some cases feuding over the order of precedence as in Layamon. There is a possibility that Wace, contrary to his own claims, derived Arthur&#x27;s round table not from any Breton source, but rather from medieval biographies of Charlemagne—notably Einhard&#x27;s &quot;Vita Caroli&quot; and Notker the Stammerer&#x27;s &quot;De Carolo Magno&quot;—in which the king is said to have possessed a round table decorated with a map of Rome.

The Round Table takes on new dimensions in the romances of the late 12th and early 13th century, where it becomes a symbol of the famed order of chivalry which flourishes under Arthur. In Robert de Boron&#x27;s &quot;Merlin&quot;, written around 1200, the magician Merlin creates the Round Table in imitation of the table of the Last Supper and of Joseph of Arimathea&#x27;s Grail Table. Made of silver, the Grail Table was used by the followers of Arimathea after he created it as directed by a vision of Christ, and was taken by him to Avalon (later identified with Glastonbury Tor, but this connection was not mentioned by Robert). This version of the Round Table, here made for Arthur&#x27;s father Uther Pendragon rather than Arthur himself, has twelve seats and one empty place to mark the betrayal of Judas; this seat, must remain empty until the coming of the knight who will achieve the Grail. The Didot &quot;Perceval&quot;, a prose continuation of Robert&#x27;s work, takes up the story as the knight Perceval sits in the seat and initiates the Grail quest.

The prose cycles of the 13th century, the Lancelot-Grail (Vulgate) Cycle and the Post-Vulgate Cycle, further adapt the chivalric attributes of the Round Table but make it and its fellowship much larger, with many more seats and usually dozens of members at any given time. Here it is the perfect knight Galahad, rather than Percival, who assumes the empty seat, now called the Siege Perilous. Galahad&#x27;s arrival marks the start of the Grail quest as well as the end of the Arthurian era. In these works the Round Table is kept by King Leodegrance of Cameliard after Uther&#x27;s death; Arthur inherits it when he marries Leodegrance&#x27;s daughter Guinevere. Other versions treat the Round Table differently, for instance Arthurian works from Italy like &quot;La Tavola Ritonda&quot; (&quot;The Round Table&quot;) often distinguish between the knights of the &quot;Old Table&quot; of Uther&#x27;s time and those of Arthur&#x27;s &quot;New Table&quot;. In the Post-Vulgate, the Table is eventually destroyed by King Mark during his invasion of Logres after the deaths of Arthur and almost all of the Knights, many of whom in fact had killed each other, especially in internal conflicts at the end of the cycle. 

==Round Table tournaments==
During the Middle Ages, festivals called Round Tables were celebrated throughout Europe in imitation of Arthur&#x27;s court. These events featured jousting, dancing, and feasting, and in some cases attending knights assumed the identities of Arthur&#x27;s entourage.

==Winchester Round Table==
The Winchester Round Table is a large tabletop hanging in Winchester Castle and bearing the names of various knights of Arthur&#x27;s court, was probably created for a Round Table tournament. The table is in diameter and weighs . The current paintwork is late; it was done by order of King Henry VIII of England. The table itself is considerably older; dendrochronology calculates the date of construction to 1250–1280—during the reign of Edward I of England—using timbers that were felled over a period of years. Edward was an Arthurian enthusiast who attended at least five Round Tables and hosted one himself in 1299, which may have been the occasion for the creation of the Winchester Round Table. Martin Biddle, from an examination of Edward&#x27;s financial accounts, links it instead with a tournament King Edward held near Winchester on 20 April 1290, to mark the betrothal of one of his daughters.

==Historical Round Table of Edward III==
On 22 January 1344, after a tournament at Windsor Castle, King Edward III of England (r. 1327–1377) swore an oath to restore the Order of the Round Table to the same as that of King Arthur. Receiving agreement from the earls and knights present, Edward announced that the order&#x27;s first meeting would take place during Pentecost. The plan never came to fruition, but the new Order of the Garter carried connotations from this legend by the circular shape of the garter. Edward&#x27;s wartime experiences during the Crécy campaign (1346–1347) seem to have been a determining factor in his abandonment of the Round Table project. It has been argued that the total warfare tactics employed by the English at Crécy in 1346 were contrary to Arthurian chivalric ideals and made Arthur a problematic paradigm for Edward, especially at the time of the institution of the Garter. There are no formal references to King Arthur and the Round Table in the surviving early 15th-century copies of the Statutes of the Garter. However, the Garter Feast of 1358 did involve a Round Table game in an overlap between the projected Round Table fellowship and the actualized Order of the Garter.

<doc id="26428" wikidata="Q48584" url="?curid=26428" title="Rosetta Stone">
<text>The Rosetta Stone is a stele of granodiorite inscribed with three versions of a decree issued in 196 BC during the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt, on behalf of King Ptolemy V Epiphanes. The top and middle texts are in Ancient Egyptian using hieroglyphic and Demotic scripts, respectively, while the bottom is in Ancient Greek. The decree has only minor differences across the three versions, making the Rosetta Stone key to deciphering the Egyptian scripts.

The stone was carved during the Hellenistic period and is believed to have originally been displayed within a temple, possibly at Sais. It was probably moved in late antiquity or during the Mamluk period, and was eventually used as building material in the construction of Fort Julien near the town of Rashid (Rosetta) in the Nile Delta. It was found there in July 1799 by French officer Pierre-François Bouchard during the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt. It was the first Ancient Egyptian bilingual text recovered in modern times, and it aroused widespread public interest with its potential to decipher this previously untranslated hieroglyphic script. Lithographic copies and plaster casts soon began circulating among European museums and scholars. When the British defeated the French, they took the stone to London under the terms of the Capitulation of Alexandria in 1801. Since 1802, it has been on public display at the British Museum almost continuously and it is the most visited object there.

Study of the decree was already underway when the first complete translation of the Greek text was published in 1803. Jean-François Champollion announced the transliteration of the Egyptian scripts in Paris in 1822; it took longer still before scholars were able to read Ancient Egyptian inscriptions and literature confidently. Major advances in the decoding were recognition that the stone offered three versions of the same text (1799); that the Demotic text used phonetic characters to spell foreign names (1802); that the hieroglyphic text did so as well, and had pervasive similarities to the Demotic (1814); and that phonetic characters were also used to spell native Egyptian words (1822–1824).

Three other fragmentary copies of the same decree were discovered later, and several similar Egyptian bilingual or trilingual inscriptions are now known, including three slightly earlier Ptolemaic decrees: the Decree of Alexandria in 243 BC, the Decree of Canopus in 238 BC, and the Memphis decree of Ptolemy IV, c. 218 BC. Though the Rosetta Stone is now known to not be unique, it was the essential key to the modern understanding of ancient Egyptian literature and civilisation. The term &quot;Rosetta Stone&quot; is now used to refer to the essential clue to a new field of knowledge.

==Description==
The Rosetta Stone is listed as &quot;a stone of black granodiorite, bearing three inscriptions ... found at Rosetta&quot; in a contemporary catalogue of the artefacts discovered by the French expedition and surrendered to British troops in 1801. At some period after its arrival in London, the inscriptions were coloured in white chalk to make them more legible, and the remaining surface was covered with a layer of carnauba wax designed to protect it from visitors&#x27; fingers. This gave a dark colour to the stone that led to its mistaken identification as black basalt. These additions were removed when the stone was cleaned in 1999, revealing the original dark grey tint of the rock, the sparkle of its crystalline structure, and a pink vein running across the top left corner. Comparisons with the Klemm collection of Egyptian rock samples showed a close resemblance to rock from a small granodiorite quarry at Gebel Tingar on the west bank of the Nile, west of Elephantine in the region of Aswan; the pink vein is typical of granodiorite from this region.

The Rosetta Stone is high at its highest point, wide, and thick. It weighs approximately . It bears three inscriptions: the top register in Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, the second in the Egyptian Demotic script, and the third in Ancient Greek. These three scripts are not three different languages, as is commonly misunderstood. The front surface is polished and the inscriptions lightly incised on it; the sides of the stone are smoothed, but the back is only roughly worked, presumably because it would have not been visible when the stele was erected.

===Original stele===
The Rosetta Stone is a fragment of a larger stele. No additional fragments were found in later searches of the Rosetta site. Owing to its damaged state, none of the three texts is complete. The top register, composed of Egyptian hieroglyphs, suffered the most damage. Only the last 14 lines of the hieroglyphic text can be seen; all of them are broken on the right side, and 12 of them on the left. Below it, the middle register of demotic text has survived best; it has 32 lines, of which the first 14 are slightly damaged on the right side. The bottom register of Greek text contains 54 lines, of which the first 27 survive in full; the rest are increasingly fragmentary due to a diagonal break at the bottom right of the stone.

The full length of the hieroglyphic text and the total size of the original stele, of which the Rosetta Stone is a fragment, can be estimated based on comparable steles that have survived, including other copies of the same order. The slightly earlier decree of Canopus, erected in 238 BC during the reign of Ptolemy III, is and wide, and contains 36 lines of hieroglyphic text, 73 of demotic text, and 74 of Greek. The texts are of similar length. From such comparisons, it can be estimated that an additional 14 or 15 lines of hieroglyphic inscription are missing from the top register of the Rosetta Stone, amounting to another . In addition to the inscriptions, there would probably have been a scene depicting the king being presented to the gods, topped with a winged disc, as on the Canopus Stele. These parallels, and a hieroglyphic sign for &quot;stela&quot; on the stone itself (see Gardiner&#x27;s sign list),
:O26
suggest that it originally had a rounded top. The height of the original stele is estimated to have been about .

==Memphis decree and its context==

The stele was erected after the coronation of King Ptolemy V and was inscribed with a decree that established the divine cult of the new ruler. The decree was issued by a congress of priests who gathered at Memphis. The date is given as &quot;4 Xandikos&quot; in the Macedonian calendar and &quot;18 Mekhir&quot; in the Egyptian calendar, which corresponds to . The year is stated as the ninth year of Ptolemy V&#x27;s reign (equated with 197/196 BC), which is confirmed by naming four priests who officiated in that year: Aetos son of Aetos was priest of the divine cults of Alexander the Great and the five Ptolemies down to Ptolemy V himself; the other three priests named in turn in the inscription are those who led the worship of Berenice Euergetis (wife of Ptolemy III), Arsinoe Philadelphos (wife and sister of Ptolemy II), and Arsinoe Philopator, mother of Ptolemy V. However, a second date is also given in the Greek and hieroglyphic texts, corresponding to , the official anniversary of Ptolemy&#x27;s coronation. The demotic text conflicts with this, listing consecutive days in March for the decree and the anniversary. It is uncertain why this discrepancy exists, but it is clear that the decree was issued in 196 BC and that it was designed to re-establish the rule of the Ptolemaic kings over Egypt.

The decree was issued during a turbulent period in Egyptian history. Ptolemy V Epiphanes, the son of Ptolemy IV Philopator and his wife and sister Arsinoe, reigned from 204 to 181 BC. He had become ruler at the age of five after the sudden death of both of his parents, who were murdered in a conspiracy that involved Ptolemy IV&#x27;s mistress Agathoclea, according to contemporary sources. The conspirators effectively ruled Egypt as Ptolemy V&#x27;s guardians until a revolt broke out two years later under general Tlepolemus, when Agathoclea and her family were lynched by a mob in Alexandria. Tlepolemus, in turn, was replaced as guardian in 201 BC by Aristomenes of Alyzia, who was chief minister at the time of the Memphis decree.

Political forces beyond the borders of Egypt exacerbated the internal problems of the Ptolemaic kingdom. Antiochus III the Great and Philip V of Macedon had made a pact to divide Egypt&#x27;s overseas possessions. Philip had seized several islands and cities in Caria and Thrace, while the Battle of Panium (198 BC) had resulted in the transfer of Coele-Syria, including Judaea, from the Ptolemies to the Seleucids. Meanwhile, in the south of Egypt, there was a long-standing revolt that had begun during the reign of Ptolemy IV, led by Horwennefer and by his successor Ankhwennefer. Both the war and the internal revolt were still ongoing when the young Ptolemy V was officially crowned at Memphis at the age of 12 (seven years after the start of his reign) and when, just over a year later, the Memphis decree was issued.

Stelae of this kind, which were established on the initiative of the temples rather than that of the king, are unique to Ptolemaic Egypt. In the preceding Pharaonic period it would have been unheard of for anyone but the divine rulers themselves to make national decisions: by contrast, this way of honouring a king was a feature of Greek cities. Rather than making his eulogy himself, the king had himself glorified and deified by his subjects or representative groups of his subjects. The decree records that Ptolemy V gave a gift of silver and grain to the temples. It also records that there was particularly high flooding of the Nile in the eighth year of his reign, and he had the excess waters dammed for the benefit of the farmers. In return the priesthood pledged that the king&#x27;s birthday and coronation days would be celebrated annually and that all the priests of Egypt would serve him alongside the other gods. The decree concludes with the instruction that a copy was to be placed in every temple, inscribed in the &quot;language of the gods&quot; (Egyptian hieroglyphs), the &quot;language of documents&quot; (Demotic), and the &quot;language of the Greeks&quot; as used by the Ptolemaic government.

Securing the favour of the priesthood was essential for the Ptolemaic kings to retain effective rule over the populace. The High Priests of Memphis—where the king was crowned—were particularly important, as they were the highest religious authorities of the time and had influence throughout the kingdom. Given that the decree was issued at Memphis, the ancient capital of Egypt, rather than Alexandria, the centre of government of the ruling Ptolemies, it is evident that the young king was anxious to gain their active support. Thus, although the government of Egypt had been Greek-speaking ever since the conquests of Alexander the Great, the Memphis decree, like the three similar earlier decrees, included texts in Egyptian to show its connection to the general populace by way of the literate Egyptian priesthood.

There can be no one definitive English translation of the decree, not only because modern understanding of the ancient languages continues to develop, but also because of the minor differences between the three original texts. Older translations by E. A. Wallis Budge (1904, 1913) and Edwyn R. Bevan (1927) are easily available but are now outdated, as can be seen by comparing them with the recent translation by R. S. Simpson, which is based on the demotic text and can be found online, or with the modern translations of all three texts, with introduction and facsimile drawing, that were published by Quirke and Andrews in 1989.

The stele was almost certainly not originally placed at Rashid (Rosetta) where it was found, but more likely came from a temple site farther inland, possibly the royal town of Sais. The temple from which it originally came was probably closed around AD 392 when Roman emperor Theodosius I ordered the closing of all non-Christian temples of worship. The original stele broke at some point, its largest piece becoming what we now know as the Rosetta Stone. Ancient Egyptian temples were later used as quarries for new construction, and the Rosetta Stone probably was re-used in this manner. Later it was incorporated in the foundations of a fortress constructed by the Mameluke Sultan Qaitbay (/18–1496) to defend the Bolbitine branch of the Nile at Rashid. There it lay for at least another three centuries until its rediscovery.

Three other inscriptions relevant to the same Memphis decree have been found since the discovery of the Rosetta Stone: the Nubayrah Stele, a stele found in Elephantine and Noub Taha, and an inscription found at the Temple of Philae (on the Philae obelisk). Unlike the Rosetta Stone, the hieroglyphic texts of these inscriptions were relatively intact. The Rosetta Stone had been deciphered long before they were found, but later Egyptologists have used them to refine the reconstruction of the hieroglyphs that must have been used in the lost portions of the hieroglyphic text on the Rosetta Stone.

==Rediscovery==
French forces under Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt in 1798, accompanied by a corps of 151 technical experts (&quot;savants&quot;), known as the Commission des Sciences et des Arts. On 1799, French soldiers under the command of Colonel d&#x27;Hautpoul were strengthening the defences of Fort Julien, a couple of miles north-east of the Egyptian port city of Rosetta (modern-day Rashid). Lieutenant Pierre-François Bouchard spotted a slab with inscriptions on one side that the soldiers had uncovered when demolishing a wall within the fort. He and d&#x27;Hautpoul saw at once that it might be important and informed General Jacques-François Menou, who happened to be at Rosetta. The find was announced to Napoleon&#x27;s newly founded scientific association in Cairo, the Institut d&#x27;Égypte, in a report by Commission member Michel Ange Lancret noting that it contained three inscriptions, the first in hieroglyphs and the third in Greek, and rightly suggesting that the three inscriptions were versions of the same text. Lancret&#x27;s report, dated 1799, was read to a meeting of the Institute soon after . Bouchard, meanwhile, transported the stone to Cairo for examination by scholars.

The discovery was reported in September in &quot;Courrier de l&#x27;Égypte&quot;, the official newspaper of the French expedition. The anonymous reporter expressed a hope that the stone might one day be the key to deciphering hieroglyphs. In 1800 three of the commission&#x27;s technical experts devised ways to make copies of the texts on the stone. One of these experts was Jean-Joseph Marcel, a printer and gifted linguist, who is credited as the first to recognise that the middle text was written in the Egyptian demotic script, rarely used for stone inscriptions and seldom seen by scholars at that time, rather than Syriac as had originally been thought. It was artist and inventor Nicolas-Jacques Conté who found a way to use the stone itself as a printing block to reproduce the inscription. A slightly different method was adopted by Antoine Galland. The prints that resulted were taken to Paris by General Charles Dugua. Scholars in Europe were now able to see the inscriptions and attempt to read them.

After Napoleon&#x27;s departure, French troops held off British and Ottoman attacks for another 18 months. In March 1801, the British landed at Aboukir Bay. Menou was now in command of the French expedition. His troops, including the commission, marched north towards the Mediterranean coast to meet the enemy, transporting the stone along with many other antiquities. He was defeated in battle, and the remnant of his army retreated to Alexandria where they were surrounded and besieged, with the stone now inside the city. Menou surrendered on 30 August.

==From French to British possession==

After the surrender, a dispute arose over the fate of the French archaeological and scientific discoveries in Egypt, including the artefacts, biological specimens, notes, plans, and drawings collected by the members of the commission. Menou refused to hand them over, claiming that they belonged to the institute. British General John Hely-Hutchinson refused to end the siege until Menou gave in. Scholars Edward Daniel Clarke and William Richard Hamilton, newly arrived from England, agreed to examine the collections in Alexandria and said they had found many artefacts that the French had not revealed. In a letter home, Clarke wrote that &quot;we found much more in their possession than was represented or imagined&quot;.

Hutchinson claimed that all materials were property of the British Crown, but French scholar Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire told Clarke and Hamilton that the French would rather burn all their discoveries than turn them over, referring ominously to the destruction of the Library of Alexandria. Clarke and Hamilton pleaded the French scholars&#x27; case to Hutchinson, who finally agreed that items such as natural history specimens would be considered the scholars&#x27; private property. Menou quickly claimed the stone, too, as his private property. Hutchinson was equally aware of the stone&#x27;s unique value and rejected Menou&#x27;s claim. Eventually an agreement was reached, and the transfer of the objects was incorporated into the Capitulation of Alexandria signed by representatives of the British, French, and Ottoman forces.

It is not clear exactly how the stone was transferred into British hands, as contemporary accounts differ. Colonel Tomkyns Hilgrove Turner, who was to escort it to England, claimed later that he had personally seized it from Menou and carried it away on a gun-carriage. In a much more detailed account, Edward Daniel Clarke stated that a French &quot;officer and member of the Institute&quot; had taken him, his student John Cripps, and Hamilton secretly into the back streets behind Menou&#x27;s residence and revealed the stone hidden under protective carpets among Menou&#x27;s baggage. According to Clarke, their informant feared that the stone might be stolen if French soldiers saw it. Hutchinson was informed at once and the stone was taken away—possibly by Turner and his gun-carriage.

Turner brought the stone to England aboard the captured French frigate HMS &quot;Égyptienne&quot;, landing in Portsmouth in February 1802. His orders were to present it and the other antiquities to King George III. The King, represented by War Secretary Lord Hobart, directed that it should be placed in the British Museum. According to Turner&#x27;s narrative, he and Hobart agreed that the stone should be presented to scholars at the Society of Antiquaries of London, of which Turner was a member, before its final deposit in the museum. It was first seen and discussed there at a meeting on 1802.
In 1802, the Society created four plaster casts of the inscriptions, which were given to the universities of Oxford, Cambridge and Edinburgh and to Trinity College Dublin. Soon afterwards, prints of the inscriptions were made and circulated to European scholars. Before the end of 1802, the stone was transferred to the British Museum, where it is located today. New inscriptions painted in white on the left and right edges of the slab stated that it was &quot;Captured in Egypt by the British Army in 1801&quot; and &quot;Presented by King George III&quot;.

The stone has been exhibited almost continuously in the British Museum since June 1802. During the middle of the 19th century, it was given the inventory number &quot;EA 24&quot;, &quot;EA&quot; standing for &quot;Egyptian Antiquities&quot;. It was part of a collection of ancient Egyptian monuments captured from the French expedition, including a sarcophagus of Nectanebo II (EA 10), the statue of a high priest of Amun (EA 81), and a large granite fist (EA 9). The objects were soon discovered to be too heavy for the floors of Montagu House (the original building of The British Museum), and they were transferred to a new extension that was added to the mansion. The Rosetta Stone was transferred to the sculpture gallery in 1834 shortly after Montagu House was demolished and replaced by the building that now houses the British Museum. According to the museum&#x27;s records, the Rosetta Stone is its most-visited single object, a simple image of it was the museum&#x27;s best selling postcard for several decades, and a wide variety of merchandise bearing the text from the Rosetta Stone (or replicating its distinctive shape) is sold in the museum shops.
The Rosetta Stone was originally displayed at a slight angle from the horizontal, and rested within a metal cradle that was made for it, which involved shaving off very small portions of its sides to ensure that the cradle fitted securely. It originally had no protective covering, and it was found necessary by 1847 to place it in a protective frame, despite the presence of attendants to ensure that it was not touched by visitors. Since 2004 the conserved stone has been on display in a specially built case in the centre of the Egyptian Sculpture Gallery. A replica of the Rosetta Stone is now available in the King&#x27;s Library of the British Museum, without a case and free to touch, as it would have appeared to early 19th-century visitors.

The museum was concerned about heavy bombing in London towards the end of the First World War in 1917, and the Rosetta Stone was moved to safety, along with other portable objects of value. The stone spent the next two years below ground level in a station of the Postal Tube Railway at Mount Pleasant near Holborn. Other than during wartime, the Rosetta Stone has left the British Museum only once: for one month in October 1972, to be displayed alongside Champollion&#x27;s &quot;Lettre&quot; at the Louvre in Paris on the 150th anniversary of the letter&#x27;s publication. Even when the Rosetta Stone was undergoing conservation measures in 1999, the work was done in the gallery so that it could remain visible to the public.

==Reading the Rosetta Stone==
Prior to the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and its eventual decipherment, the ancient Egyptian language and script had not been understood since shortly before the fall of the Roman Empire. The usage of the hieroglyphic script had become increasingly specialised even in the later Pharaonic period; by the 4th century AD, few Egyptians were capable of reading them. Monumental use of hieroglyphs ceased as temple priesthoods died out and Egypt was converted to Christianity; the last known inscription is dated to , found at Philae and known as the Graffito of Esmet-Akhom. The last demotic text, also from Philae, was written in 452.

Hieroglyphs retained their pictorial appearance, and classical authors emphasised this aspect, in sharp contrast to the Greek and Roman alphabets. In the 5th century, the priest Horapollo wrote &quot;Hieroglyphica&quot;, an explanation of almost 200 glyphs. His work was believed to be authoritative, yet it was misleading in many ways, and this and other works were a lasting impediment to the understanding of Egyptian writing. Later attempts at decipherment were made by Arab historians in medieval Egypt during the 9th and 10th centuries. Dhul-Nun al-Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya were the first historians to study hieroglyphs, by comparing them to the contemporary Coptic language used by Coptic priests in their time. The study of hieroglyphs continued with fruitless attempts at decipherment by European scholars, notably Pierius Valerianus in the 16th century and Athanasius Kircher in the 17th. The discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 provided critical missing information, gradually revealed by a succession of scholars, that eventually allowed Jean-François Champollion to solve the puzzle that Kircher had called the riddle of the Sphinx.

===Greek text===
The Greek text on the Rosetta Stone provided the starting point. Ancient Greek was widely known to scholars, but they were not familiar with details of its use in the Hellenistic period as a government language in Ptolemaic Egypt; large-scale discoveries of Greek papyri were a long way in the future. Thus, the earliest translations of the Greek text of the stone show the translators still struggling with the historical context and with administrative and religious jargon. Stephen Weston verbally presented an English translation of the Greek text at a Society of Antiquaries meeting in April 1802.

Meanwhile, two of the lithographic copies made in Egypt had reached the Institut de France in Paris in 1801. There, librarian and antiquarian Gabriel de La Porte du Theil set to work on a translation of the Greek, but he was dispatched elsewhere on Napoleon&#x27;s orders almost immediately, and he left his unfinished work in the hands of colleague Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon. Ameilhon produced the first published translations of the Greek text in 1803, in both Latin and French to ensure that they would circulate widely. At Cambridge, Richard Porson worked on the missing lower right corner of the Greek text. He produced a skilful suggested reconstruction, which was soon being circulated by the Society of Antiquaries alongside its prints of the inscription. At almost the same moment, Christian Gottlob Heyne in Göttingen was making a new Latin translation of the Greek text that was more reliable than Ameilhon&#x27;s and was first published in 1803. It was reprinted by the Society of Antiquaries in a special issue of its journal &quot;Archaeologia&quot; in 1811, alongside Weston&#x27;s previously unpublished English translation, Colonel Turner&#x27;s narrative, and other documents.

===Demotic text===
At the time of the stone&#x27;s discovery, Swedish diplomat and scholar Johan David Åkerblad was working on a little-known script of which some examples had recently been found in Egypt, which came to be known as Demotic. He called it &quot;cursive Coptic&quot; because he was convinced that it was used to record some form of the Coptic language (the direct descendant of Ancient Egyptian), although it had few similarities with the later Coptic script. French Orientalist Antoine-Isaac Silvestre de Sacy had been discussing this work with Åkerblad when, in 1801, he received one of the early lithographic prints of the Rosetta Stone, from Jean-Antoine Chaptal, French minister of the interior. He realised that the middle text was in this same script. He and Åkerblad set to work, both focusing on the middle text and assuming that the script was alphabetical. They attempted to identify the points where Greek names ought to occur within this unknown text, by comparing it with the Greek. In 1802, Silvestre de Sacy reported to Chaptal that he had successfully identified five names (&quot;&quot;Alexandros&quot;, &quot;Alexandreia&quot;, &quot;Ptolemaios&quot;, &quot;Arsinoe&quot;, and Ptolemy&#x27;s title &quot;Epiphanes&quot;&quot;), while Åkerblad published an alphabet of 29 letters (more than half of which were correct) that he had identified from the Greek names in the Demotic text. They could not, however, identify the remaining characters in the Demotic text, which, as is now known, included ideographic and other symbols alongside the phonetic ones.

===Hieroglyphic text===
Silvestre de Sacy eventually gave up work on the stone, but he was to make another contribution. In 1811, prompted by discussions with a Chinese student about Chinese script, Silvestre de Sacy considered a suggestion made by Georg Zoëga in 1797 that the foreign names in Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions might be written phonetically; he also recalled that as early as 1761, Jean-Jacques Barthélemy had suggested that the characters enclosed in cartouches in hieroglyphic inscriptions were proper names. Thus, when Thomas Young, foreign secretary of the Royal Society of London, wrote to him about the stone in 1814, Silvestre de Sacy suggested in reply that in attempting to read the hieroglyphic text, Young might look for cartouches that ought to contain Greek names and try to identify phonetic characters in them.

Young did so, with two results that together paved the way for the final decipherment. In the hieroglyphic text, he discovered the phonetic characters &quot; (in today&#x27;s transliteration &quot;) that were used to write the Greek name &quot;&quot;. He also noticed that these characters resembled the equivalent ones in the demotic script, and went on to note as many as 80 similarities between the hieroglyphic and demotic texts on the stone, an important discovery because the two scripts were previously thought to be entirely different from one another. This led him to deduce correctly that the demotic script was only partly phonetic, also consisting of ideographic characters derived from hieroglyphs. Young&#x27;s new insights were prominent in the long article &quot;Egypt&quot; that he contributed to the in 1819. He could make no further progress, however.

In 1814, Young first exchanged correspondence about the stone with Jean-François Champollion, a teacher at Grenoble who had produced a scholarly work on ancient Egypt. Champollion saw copies of the brief hieroglyphic and Greek inscriptions of the Philae obelisk in 1822, on which William John Bankes had tentatively noted the names &quot; and &quot; in both languages. From this, Champollion identified the phonetic characters (in today&#x27;s transliteration ). On the basis of this and the foreign names on the Rosetta Stone, he quickly constructed an alphabet of phonetic hieroglyphic characters, completing his work on 14 September and announcing it publicly on 27 September in a lecture to the . On the same day he wrote the famous &quot;&quot; to Bon-Joseph Dacier, secretary of the Académie, detailing his discovery. In the postscript Champollion notes that similar phonetic characters seemed to occur in both Greek and Egyptian names, a hypothesis confirmed in 1823, when he identified the names of pharaohs Ramesses and Thutmose written in cartouches at Abu Simbel. These far older hieroglyphic inscriptions had been copied by Bankes and sent to Champollion by Jean-Nicolas Huyot. From this point, the stories of the Rosetta Stone and the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs diverge, as Champollion drew on many other texts to develop an Ancient Egyptian grammar and a hieroglyphic dictionary which were published after his death in 1832.

===Later work===

Work on the stone now focused on fuller understanding of the texts and their contexts by comparing the three versions with one another. In 1824 Classical scholar Antoine-Jean Letronne promised to prepare a new literal translation of the Greek text for Champollion&#x27;s use. Champollion in return promised an analysis of all the points at which the three texts seemed to differ. Following Champollion&#x27;s sudden death in 1832, his draft of this analysis could not be found, and Letronne&#x27;s work stalled. François Salvolini, Champollion&#x27;s former student and assistant, died in 1838, and this analysis and other missing drafts were found among his papers. This discovery incidentally demonstrated that Salvolini&#x27;s own publication on the stone, published in 1837, was plagiarism. Letronne was at last able to complete his commentary on the Greek text and his new French translation of it, which appeared in 1841. During the early 1850s, German Egyptologists Heinrich Brugsch and Max Uhlemann produced revised Latin translations based on the demotic and hieroglyphic texts. The first English translation followed in 1858, the work of three members of the Philomathean Society at the University of Pennsylvania.

Whether one of the three texts was the standard version, from which the other two were originally translated, is a question that has remained controversial. Letronne attempted to show in 1841 that the Greek version, the product of the Egyptian government under the Macedonian Ptolemies, was the original. Among recent authors, John Ray has stated that &quot;the hieroglyphs were the most important of the scripts on the stone: they were there for the gods to read, and the more learned of their priesthood&quot;. Philippe Derchain and Heinz Josef Thissen have argued that all three versions were composed simultaneously, while Stephen Quirke sees in the decree &quot;an intricate coalescence of three vital textual traditions&quot;. Richard Parkinson points out that the hieroglyphic version strays from archaic formalism and occasionally lapses into language closer to that of the demotic register that the priests more commonly used in everyday life. The fact that the three versions cannot be matched word for word helps to explain why the decipherment has been more difficult than originally expected, especially for those original scholars who were expecting an exact bilingual key to Egyptian hieroglyphs.

===Rivalries===
Even before the Salvolini affair, disputes over precedence and plagiarism punctuated the decipherment story. Thomas Young&#x27;s work is acknowledged in Champollion&#x27;s 1822 &quot;Lettre à M. Dacier&quot;, but incompletely, according to early British critics: for example, James Browne, a sub-editor on the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (which had published Young&#x27;s 1819 article), anonymously contributed a series of review articles to the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; in 1823, praising Young&#x27;s work highly and alleging that the &quot;unscrupulous&quot; Champollion plagiarised it. These articles were translated into French by Julius Klaproth and published in book form in 1827. Young&#x27;s own 1823 publication reasserted the contribution that he had made. The early deaths of Young (1829) and Champollion (1832) did not put an end to these disputes. In his work on the stone in 1904 E. A. Wallis Budge gave special emphasis to Young&#x27;s contribution compared with Champollion&#x27;s. In the early 1970s, French visitors complained that the portrait of Champollion was smaller than one of Young on an adjacent information panel; English visitors complained that the opposite was true. The portraits were in fact the same size.

==Requests for repatriation to Egypt==
Calls for the Rosetta Stone to be returned to Egypt were made in July 2003 by Zahi Hawass, then Secretary-General of Egypt&#x27;s Supreme Council of Antiquities. These calls, expressed in the Egyptian and international media, asked that the stele be repatriated to Egypt, commenting that it was the &quot;icon of our Egyptian identity&quot;. He repeated the proposal two years later in Paris, listing the stone as one of several key items belonging to Egypt&#x27;s cultural heritage, a list which also included: the iconic bust of Nefertiti in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin; a statue of the Great Pyramid architect Hemiunu in the Roemer-und-Pelizaeus-Museum in Hildesheim, Germany; the Dendera Temple Zodiac in the Louvre in Paris; and the bust of Ankhhaf in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. In August 2022, Zahi Hawass reiterated his previous demands.

In 2005, the British Museum presented Egypt with a full-sized fibreglass colour-matched replica of the stele. This was initially displayed in the renovated Rashid National Museum, an Ottoman house in the town of Rashid (Rosetta), the closest city to the site where the stone was found. In November 2005, Hawass suggested a three-month loan of the Rosetta Stone, while reiterating the eventual goal of a permanent return. In December 2009, he proposed to drop his claim for the permanent return of the Rosetta Stone if the British Museum lent the stone to Egypt for three months for the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum at Giza in 2013.

As John Ray has observed: &quot;The day may come when the stone has spent longer in the British Museum than it ever did in Rosetta.&quot;

National museums typically express strong opposition to the repatriation of objects of international cultural significance such as the Rosetta Stone. In response to repeated Greek requests for return of the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon and similar requests to other museums around the world, in 2002, over 30 of the world&#x27;s leading museums—including the British Museum, the Louvre, the Pergamon Museum in Berlin, and the Metropolitan Museum in New York City—issued a joint statement:

==Idiomatic use==
Various ancient bilingual or even trilingual epigraphical documents have sometimes been described as &quot;Rosetta stones&quot;, as they permitted the decipherment of ancient written scripts. For example, the bilingual Greek-Brahmi coins of the Greco-Bactrian king Agathocles have been described as &quot;little Rosetta stones&quot;, allowing Christian Lassen&#x27;s initial progress towards deciphering the Brahmi script, thus unlocking ancient Indian epigraphy. The Behistun inscription has also been compared to the Rosetta stone, as it links the translations of three ancient Middle-Eastern languages: Old Persian, Elamite, and Akkadian.

The term &quot;Rosetta stone&quot; has been also used idiomatically to denote the first crucial key in the process of decryption of encoded information, especially when a small but representative sample is recognised as the clue to understanding a larger whole. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the first figurative use of the term appeared in the 1902 edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; relating to an entry on the chemical analysis of glucose. Another use of the phrase is found in H. G. Wells&#x27;s 1933 novel &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot;, where the protagonist finds a manuscript written in shorthand that provides a key to understanding additional scattered material that is sketched out in both longhand and on typewriter.

Since then, the term has been widely used in other contexts. For example, Nobel laureate Theodor W. Hänsch in a 1979 &quot;Scientific American&quot; article on spectroscopy wrote that &quot;the spectrum of the hydrogen atoms has proven to be the Rosetta Stone of modern physics: once this pattern of lines had been deciphered much else could also be understood&quot;. Fully understanding the key set of genes to the human leucocyte antigen has been described as &quot;the Rosetta Stone of immunology&quot;. The flowering plant &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; has been called the &quot;Rosetta Stone of flowering time&quot;. A gamma-ray burst (GRB) found in conjunction with a supernova has been called a Rosetta Stone for understanding the origin of GRBs. The technique of Doppler echocardiography has been called a Rosetta Stone for clinicians trying to understand the complex process by which the left ventricle of the human heart can be filled during various forms of diastolic dysfunction. The European Space Agency&#x27;s &quot;Rosetta&quot; spacecraft, launched to study the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko in the hope that determining its composition will advance understanding of the origins of the Solar System.

The name is used for various forms of translation software and services. &quot;Rosetta Stone&quot; is a brand of language-learning software published by Rosetta Stone Inc., who are headquartered in Arlington County, US. Additionally, &quot;Rosetta&quot;, developed and maintained by Canonical (the Ubuntu Linux company) as part of the Launchpad project, is an online language translation tool to help with localisation of software. One program, billed as a &quot;lightweight dynamic translator&quot; that enables applications compiled for PowerPC processors to run on x86 processor Apple Inc. systems, is named &quot;Rosetta&quot;. The Rosetta@home endeavour is a distributed computing project for predicting protein structures from amino acid sequences (i.e. &quot;translating&quot; sequence into structure). Rosetta Code is a wiki-based chrestomathy website with algorithm implementations in several programming languages. The Rosetta Project brings language specialists and native speakers together to develop a meaningful survey and near-permanent archive of 1,500 languages, in physical and digital form, with the intent of it remaining useful from AD 2000 to 12,000.

<doc id="26429" wikidata="Q1580954" url="?curid=26429" title="Redshirt (stock character)">
<text>In fiction, &quot;redshirt&quot; is an informal term for a stock character who is killed off shortly after being introduced. The term often implies that said character was introduced for the sole purpose of being killed off while adding little else to the story, and is sometimes used pejoratively to point out a redshirt&#x27;s lack of good characterization or the obviousness of their incoming demise. Redshirt deaths are often used to emphasize the potential peril faced by more important characters.

The term originates from the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series (1966–69), in which red-uniformed security officers and engineers often suffered deaths in the episode in which they first appeared, in contrast to most of the show&#x27;s main characters wearing other colors.

==Origin==
In &quot;Star Trek&quot;, red-uniformed security officers and engineers who accompany the main characters on landing parties often suffer quick deaths. The first instance of what now is an established trope can be seen in the 1966 episode &quot;What Are Little Girls Made Of?&quot;

Of the 55 crew members killed in the series, twenty-four were wearing red shirts, compared to fifteen who had unconfirmed shirt colors, nine in gold shirts, and seven in blue shirts.

The &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; book &quot;Legends of the Ferengi&quot; says Starfleet security personnel &quot;rarely survive beyond the second act break&quot;. A 1998 episode of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, &quot;Valiant,&quot; also references red as a sort of bad luck omen, in which the plot centers around a group of cadets calling themselves &quot;Red Squad&quot;, almost all of whom die in the episode. The 2009 cinematic reboot of the franchise features a character named Olson (portrayed by Greg Ellis) who dies early on during a mission; he wears a red uniform in homage to the trope from the original series.

==Usage==
In other media, the term &quot;redshirt&quot; and images of characters wearing red shirts have come to represent disposable characters destined for suffering or death.

The trope, and its particular usage in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, has been parodied and deconstructed in other media. Parodies include the 1999 comedy film &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot;, about actors from a defunct science-fiction television series serving on a real starship, which includes an actor who is terrified that he&#x27;s going to die because his only appearance in the show was as an unnamed character who was killed early in the episode. The novel &quot;Redshirts&quot; by John Scalzi satirizes the trope, as does the video game &quot;Redshirt&quot;.

<text>The &quot;Resolution&quot; class was a class of four nuclear ballistic missile submarines (SSBN) built for the Royal Navy as part of the UK Polaris programme. Each submarine was armed with up to 16 UGM-27 Polaris A-3 nuclear missiles.

The class comprised , , and . They were built by Vickers Armstrong in Barrow-in-Furness and Cammell Laird in Birkenhead between 1964 and 1968. All four boats were based at HM Naval Base Clyde (HMS &quot;Neptune&quot;), west of Glasgow, Scotland.

The &quot;Resolution&quot; class was the launch platform for the United Kingdom&#x27;s strategic nuclear deterrent from the late 1960s until 1996, when it was replaced by the carrying the Trident II.

==Background==

During the 1950s and early 1960s, the United Kingdom&#x27;s nuclear deterrent was based on the RAF&#x27;s V-bombers. But in the early 1960s developments in radar and surface-to-air missiles made it clear that bombers were becoming vulnerable, and would be unlikely to penetrate Soviet airspace. Free-fall nuclear weapons would no longer be a credible deterrent.

To address this problem, in May 1960 the British Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan arranged a deal with US President Eisenhower to equip the V bombers with the US-designed AGM-48 Skybolt. The Skybolt was a range ballistic missile that allowed the launching bombers to remain well away from Soviet defences and launch attacks that would be basically invulnerable. With this range, the V bombers would have to fly only a few hundred miles from their bases before being in range for an attack on Moscow.

Under the agreement the UK&#x27;s contribution to the programme was limited to developing suitable mounting points on the Avro Vulcan bomber, installing the required guidance systems that fed the missiles updated positioning information, and development of a British version of the US W47 warhead to arm it, the RE.179 .

===The Skybolt crisis===
The incoming Kennedy administration expressed serious doubts of both Skybolt and the US deterrent force in general. Robert McNamara was highly critical of the US bomber fleet, which he saw as obsolete in an age of ICBMs. Skybolt was seen simply as a means of continuing the existence of a system he no longer considered credible, and given the rapidly improving capabilities of ICBM inertial guidance systems, a precision strike capability with free-fall bombs would no longer be needed. McNamara was equally concerned about the UK also having its own nuclear force, and worried that the US could be drawn into a war by the UK. He wanted to bring the UK into a dual-key arrangement.

McNamara first broached the idea of cancelling Skybolt with the British in November 1962. When this was reported in the House of Commons, a storm of protest broke out. A meeting was arranged to settle the issue, and Macmillan stated in no uncertain terms that the UK would be retaining their independent deterrent capability, no matter what the cost. With development of their Polaris-derived warheads well along, a suitable launch platform would be developed, if need be.

Faced with a clear failure in policy terms, Kennedy gave up on the idea of strong-arming Britain into accepting a dual-key arrangement. By the end of the series of meetings, the UK had gained the much more impressive Polaris system, and would start development of a new submarine to launch it. The SSBNs would then take over the nuclear deterrent role from the RAF&#x27;s V bombers from 1968 onwards.

==Construction==
Two pairs of the boats were ordered in May 1963 from Vickers Shipbuilding Ltd, Barrow in Furness and from Cammell Laird and Co. Ltd, Birkenhead. The option of buying a fifth unit, planned as , was cancelled in February 1965 as a cost-savings measure by the government of Prime Minister Harold Wilson. Traditional battleship names were used, signifying that they were the capital ships of their time.

Vickers Armstrong in Barrow-in-Furness constructed &quot;Resolution&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; and Cammell Laird in Birkenhead constructed &quot;Renown&quot; and &quot;Revenge&quot;. The construction was unusual in that the bow and stern were constructed separately before being assembled together with the American-designed missile compartment.

The design was a modification of the fleet submarine, but greatly extended to incorporate the missile compartment between the fin and the nuclear reactor. The length was , breadth , height and the displacement submerged and surfaced. A Rolls-Royce pressurised water reactor (PWR1) and English Electric Company turbines gave them a speed of and they could dive to depths of . Sixteen Polaris A3 missiles were carried, in two rows of eight. For emergencies there was a diesel generator and six torpedo tubes located at the bow, firing the Tigerfish wire-guided homing torpedoes. The submarines put to sea with a crew of 143.

According to former head of the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors R.J. Daniel, the &quot;Resolution&quot;-class SSBNs possessed five features that were envied by the United States Navy: the machinery loading hatch, automated hovering system, welded hull valves, standardised valves, and raft-mounted propulsion machinery.

The first to be completed was &quot;Resolution&quot;, laid down in February 1964 and launched in September 1966. After commissioning in 1967 she underwent a long period of sea trials, culminating in the test firing of a Polaris missile from the USAF Eastern Test Range off Cape Kennedy at 11:15 on 15 February 1968. &quot;Resolution&quot; commenced her first operational patrol on 15 June 1968, beginning 28 years of Polaris patrols. The class were part of the 10th Submarine Squadron, all based at Faslane Naval Base, Scotland.

All four of the class underwent conversion during the 1980s so that they could be fitted with the Polaris A3TK missile which was fitted with the British-developed Chevaline MRV system.

As the newer &quot;Vanguard&quot;-class submarines entered service, the &quot;Resolution&quot; class was eventually retired and all boats laid up at Rosyth dockyard with their used nuclear fuel removed. All four will eventually be disposed of via MOD&#x27;s Submarine Dismantling Project (SDP). This project will begin in 2016 with as the first submarine to prove the technique. The selected method will first remove all Low-level radioactive waste from the vessel, followed by the more radioactive intermediate-level waste. All non-radioactive material in the remainder of the vessel will be recycled for re-use by conventional ship-breaking techniques.

===Refits===

New methods of project management were used in the refits of the &quot;Resolution&quot; class, including:
* &quot;The appointment of a senior officer of two star rank and with the title of Assistant Controller (Polaris), working under the joint superintendence of the Controller of the Navy and Chief of Fleet Support, whose responsibilities will include the oversight of the preparations for refits of Polaris boats, and their completion;&quot;
* &quot;The delegation to a designated officer (Director, Project Technical Submarines) of the responsibility for drawing up the &quot;work package&quot; for each refit, which will include full design information and documentation;&quot;
* &quot;The use of a fully integrated refit management team at Rosyth, and&quot;
* &quot;The full use of available management techniques and aids, including computers.&quot;

<text>Roger Angell (September 19, 1920 – May 20, 2022) was an American essayist known for his writing on sports, especially baseball. He was a regular contributor to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and was its chief fiction editor for many years. He wrote numerous works of fiction, non-fiction, and criticism, and for many years wrote an annual Christmas poem for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Sportswriter Jane Leavy called him &quot;the Babe Ruth of baseball writers.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Born on September 19, 1920, in Manhattan, New York, Angell was the son of Katharine Sergeant Angell White, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s first fiction editor, and the stepson of renowned essayist E. B. White, but he was raised for the most part by his father, Ernest Angell, an attorney who became head of the American Civil Liberties Union. 

After graduating in 1938 from the Pomfret School, he attended Harvard College. He served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II.

==Career==
In 1948, Angell was employed at &quot;Holiday Magazine&quot;, a travel magazine that featured literary writers. His earliest published works were pieces of short fiction and personal narratives, several of which were collected in &quot;The Stone Arbor and Other Stories&quot; (1960) and &quot;A Day in the Life of Roger Angell&quot; (1970).

Angell first contributed to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; while serving in Hawaii as editor of an Air Force magazine; his short story titled &quot;Three Ladies in the Morning&quot; was published in March 1944. He became &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s fiction editor in the 1950s, occupying the same office as his mother, and continued to write for the magazine until 2020. &quot;Longevity was actually quite low on his list of accomplishments&quot;, wrote his colleague David Remnick. &quot;He did as much to distinguish &quot;The New Yorker&quot; as anyone in the magazine&#x27;s nearly century-long history. His prose and his editorial judgment left an imprint that&#x27;s hard to overstate.&quot;

He first wrote professionally about baseball in 1962, when &quot;New Yorker&quot; editor William Shawn had him travel to Florida to write about spring training. His career as a baseball writer coincided with the first season of the New York Mets. His style of baseball writing was inspired, he said, by John Updike&#x27;s article on Ted Williams&#x27;s farewell to fans at Fenway Park, &quot;Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu&quot;. Angell said &quot;John had already supplied my tone, while also seeming to invite me to try for a good sentence now and then, down the line.” His first two baseball collections were &quot;The Summer Game&quot; (1972) and &quot;Five Seasons&quot; (1977). These were followed by &quot;Late Innings&quot; (1982) and &quot;Season Ticket: A Baseball Companion&quot; (1988). 

Angell has been called the &quot;Poet Laureate of baseball&quot; but he disliked the term. In a review of &quot;Once More Around the Park&quot; for the &quot;Journal of Sport History&quot;, Richard C. Crepeau wrote that &quot;Gone for Good&quot;, Angell&#x27;s essay on the career of Steve Blass, &quot;may be the best piece that anyone has ever written on baseball or any other sport&quot;. Another essay of Angell&#x27;s, &quot;The Web of the Game&quot;, about the epic pitchers&#x27; duel between future major-league All-Stars (and eventual teammates) Ron Darling and Frank Viola in the 1981 NCAA baseball tournament, was called &quot;perhaps the greatest baseball essay ever penned&quot; by ESPN journalist Ryan McGee in 2021. Angell contributed commentary to the Ken Burns series &quot;Baseball&quot;, in 1994.

==Personal life and death==
Angell was married three times. He had two daughters, Callie and Alice, with his first wife, Evelyn Baker, to whom he was married for 19 years before divorcing. Angell had a son, John Henry, with his second wife, Carol Rogge. After 48 years of marriage, Carol Angell died on April 10, 2012, at the age of 73 of metastatic breast cancer. In 2014, he married Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Moorman.

His daughter Callie, an authority on the films of Andy Warhol, died by suicide on May 5, 2010, in Manhattan, where she worked as a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art; she was 62. In a 2014 essay, he mentioned her death – &quot;the oceanic force and mystery of that event&quot; – and his struggle to comprehend that &quot;a beautiful daughter of mine, my oldest child, had ended her life&quot;.

Angell died of congestive heart failure at his home in Manhattan on May 20, 2022, at the age of 101.

== Awards and legacy ==
David Remnick said, “I’m not sure there’s ever been a writer so strong, and an editor so important, all at once, at a magazine since the days of H.L. Mencken running &quot;The American Mercury&quot;,” adding “Roger was a vigorous editor, and an intellect with broad tastes.” Per his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary, &quot;Like his mother, Mr. Angell became a New Yorker fiction editor, discovering and nurturing writers, including Ann Beattie, Bobbie Ann Mason and Garrison Keillor. For a while he occupied his mother’s old office — an experience, he told an interviewer, that was &#x27;the weirdest thing in the world.&#x27; He also worked closely with writers like Vladimir Nabokov, John Updike, Donald Barthelme, Ruth Jhabvala and V.S. Pritchett.&quot;

Angell received a number of awards for his writing, including the George Polk Award for Commentary in 1980, the &quot;Kenyon Review&quot; Award for Literary Achievement in 2005 along with Umberto Eco, and the inaugural PEN/ESPN Lifetime Achievement Award for Literary Sports Writing in 2011. He was a long-time ex-officio member of the council of the Authors Guild, and was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2007. His article &quot;This Old Man&quot; in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on his &quot;challenges and joys of being 93&quot; garnered the National Magazine Award for Essays and Criticism in 2015.
He was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary&#x27;s Shrine of the Eternals in 2010, and he was the 2014 recipient of the J. G. Taylor Spink Award, now known as the BBWAA Career Excellence Award, of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America; despite being a &quot;New Yorker&quot; writer, he was nominated by the San Francisco–Oakland chapter. In 2015 he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a unique combination with the Baseball Hall of Fame. 

Ross Douthat named &quot;Late Innings&quot;, &quot;The Summer Game&quot; and &quot;Five Seasons&quot; as influences: &quot;I can’t point to any specific philosophy or perspective on contemporary America that I arrived at from reading, re-reading, and re-re-reading Angell’s luminous accounts of baseball seasons past. But if I were to make a list of writers who taught me how to write, he’d be near the top of it.&quot; Michael Chabon names Angell and Jan Morris as &quot;two of my favorite authors who are primarily writers of non-fiction.&quot; 

Angell has four pieces excerpted in the Library of America volume &quot;Baseball: A Literary Anthology&quot;, more than any other author. Editor Nicholas Dawidoff quotes a letter Angell&#x27;s stepfather, E. B. White, wrote to Angell: &quot;It&#x27;s new and exciting to have someone exploring baseball at the depth you have ventured into.&quot; Dawidoff writes: Angell&#x27;s achievement was to turn quotidian baseball writing into belles lettres. In so doing he became the preeminent baseball writer of our era, a generous, appreciative, meticulous observer whose descriptions of the game are set forth with grace, brio, and wit. (Who else would refer to &quot;the vast pastel conch of Dodger Stadium&quot;?) Angell has Wagnerian range (Honus, that is); he is a master capable of vivid excursions into the profile (see Bob Gibson); he can make games he never saw breathtaking in their excitement (witness the 1986 National League playoffs); and he often reflects on matters philosophical (&quot;The Interior Stadium&quot; is the consummate baseball essay). He can write at length and, what is often more difficult, can write in brief.

<text>Rent (stylized in all caps) is a rock musical with music, lyrics, and book by Jonathan Larson. Loosely based on the 1896 opera &quot;La bohème&quot; by Giacomo Puccini, Luigi Illica, and Giuseppe Giacosa, it tells the story of a group of impoverished young artists struggling to survive and create a life in Lower Manhattan&#x27;s East Village, in the thriving days of the bohemian culture of Alphabet City, under the shadow of HIV/AIDS.

The musical was first seen in 1993 in a workshop production at New York Theatre Workshop, the off-Broadway theatre which was also where the musical began performances on January 26, 1996. The show&#x27;s creator, Jonathan Larson, had died suddenly of an aortic dissection the night before. The musical moved to Broadway&#x27;s larger Nederlander Theatre on April 29, 1996.

On Broadway, &quot;Rent&quot; gained critical acclaim and won several awards, including the Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the Tony Award for Best Musical. The Broadway production closed on September 7, 2008, after 12 years, making it one of the longest-running shows on Broadway. The production grossed over $280 million.

The success of the show led to several national tours and numerous foreign productions. In 2005, it was adapted into a motion picture featuring six of the eight principal cast members from the 1996 stage premiere.

==Concept and genesis==
In 1988, playwright Billy Aronson wanted to create &quot;a musical based on Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La Bohème&quot;, in which the luscious splendor of Puccini&#x27;s world would be replaced with the coarseness and noise of modern New York.&quot; In 1989, Jonathan Larson, a 29-year-old composer, began collaborating with Aronson on this project, and the two composed together &quot;Santa Fe&quot;, &quot;Rent&quot;, and &quot;I Should Tell You&quot;. Larson suggested setting the play &quot;in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan. He suggested making &quot;Rent&quot; the title; Aronson agreed. In 1991, he asked Aronson if he could use Aronson&#x27;s original concept and make &quot;Rent&quot; his own. Larson had ambitious expectations for &quot;Rent&quot;; his ultimate dream was to write a rock opera &quot;to bring musical theater to the MTV generation&quot;. Aronson and Larson made an agreement that if the show went to Broadway, Aronson would share in the proceeds and be given credit for &quot;original concept &amp; additional lyrics&quot;.

Jonathan Larson focused on composing &quot;Rent&quot; in the early 1990s, waiting tables at the Moondance Diner to support himself. Over the course of years, Larson wrote hundreds of songs and made many drastic changes to the show, which in its final incarnation contained 42 songs. In the fall of 1992, Larson approached James Nicola, artistic director of New York Theatre Workshop, with a tape and copy of &quot;Rent&quot;″s script. When &quot;Rent&quot; had its first staged reading at New York Theatre Workshop in March 1993, it became evident that, despite its very promising material and moving musical numbers, many structural problems needed to be addressed, including its cumbersome length and overly complex plot.

As of 1994, the New York Theatre Workshop version of &quot;Rent&quot; featured songs that never made it into the final version, such as:

* &quot;You&#x27;re a Fool&quot;
* &quot;Do a Little Business&quot;, the predecessor of &quot;You&#x27;ll See&quot;, featuring Benny, Mark, Roger, Collins and Angel
* &quot;Female to Female A &amp; B&quot;, featuring Maureen and Joanne
* &quot;He&#x27;s a Fool&quot;
* &quot;He Says&quot;
* &quot;Right Brain, Left Brain&quot;, later rewritten as &quot;One Song Glory&quot;, featuring Roger
* &quot;You&#x27;ll Get Over It&quot;, the predecessor of &quot;Tango: Maureen&quot;, featuring Mark and Maureen
* &quot;Real Estate&quot;, a number wherein Benny tries to convince Mark to become a real estate agent and drop his filmmaking
* &quot;Open Road&quot;, the predecessor of &quot;What You Own&quot;, with a backing track similar to this in &quot;Your Eyes&quot;

This workshop version of &quot;Rent&quot; starred Anthony Rapp as Mark and Daphne Rubin-Vega as Mimi. Larson continued to work on &quot;Rent&quot;, gradually reworking its flaws and staging more workshop productions.

On January 24, 1996, after the musical&#x27;s final dress rehearsal before its off-Broadway opening, Larson had his first (and only) newspaper interview; music critic Anthony Tommasini of &quot;The New York Times&quot;who had been attracted by the coincidence that the show was debuting exactly 100 years after Puccini&#x27;s operarequested the interview. Larson would not live to see &quot;Rent&quot;″s success; he died from an undiagnosed aortic dissection (believed to have resulted from Marfan syndrome) early the next morning, January 25, 1996. Friends and family gathered at the New York Theatre Workshop, and the first preview of &quot;Rent&quot; became a sing-through of the musical in Larson&#x27;s memory.

The show premiered as planned and quickly gained popularity fueled by enthusiastic reviews and the recent death of its composer. It proved extremely successful during its off-Broadway run, selling out all its shows at the 150-seat New York Theatre Workshop. Due to such overwhelming popularity and a need for a larger theater, &quot;Rent&quot; moved to Broadway&#x27;s then-under-renovation Nederlander Theatre on 41st Street and opened on April 29, 1996.

==Sources and inspiration==
Larson&#x27;s inspiration for &quot;Rent&quot;″s content came from several different sources. Many of the characters and plot elements are drawn directly from Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s opera &quot;La Bohème&quot;, the world premiere of which was in 1896, a century before &quot;Rent&quot;″s premiere. &quot;La Bohème&quot; was also about the lives of poor young artists. Tuberculosis, the plague of Puccini&#x27;s opera, is replaced by HIV/AIDS in &quot;Rent&quot;; 1800s Paris is replaced by New York&#x27;s East Village in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The names and identities of &quot;Rent&quot;″s characters also heavily reflect Puccini&#x27;s original characters, though they are not all direct adaptations. For example, Joanne in &quot;Rent&quot; represents the character of Alcindoro in &quot;Bohème&quot;, but is also partially based on Marcello. Also, Joanne is the only &quot;Rent&quot; character whose predecessor in &quot;La Bohème&quot; is a different sex.

Other examples of parallels between Larson&#x27;s and Puccini&#x27;s work include Larson&#x27;s song &quot;Light My Candle&quot;, which draws melodic content directly from &quot;Che gelida manina&quot;; &quot;Quando me&#x27;n vo&#x27;&quot; (&quot;Musetta&#x27;s Waltz&quot;), a melody taken directly from Puccini&#x27;s opera; and &quot;Goodbye Love&quot;, a long, painful piece that reflects a confrontation and parting between characters in both Puccini&#x27;s and Larson&#x27;s work. &quot;Quando me&#x27;n vo&#x27;&quot; is paralleled in the first verse of &quot;Take Me or Leave Me&quot;, when Maureen describes the way people stare when she walks in the street. It is also directly referred to in the scene where the characters are celebrating their bohemian life. Mark says, &quot;Roger will attempt to write a bittersweet, evocative song...&quot; Roger plays a quick piece, and Mark adds, &quot;...that &quot;doesn&#x27;t&quot; remind us of &#x27;Musetta&#x27;s Waltz&#x27;.&quot; This part of &quot;Musetta&#x27;s Waltz&quot; is also later used in &quot;Your Eyes&quot;, a song Roger writes.

&quot;Rent&quot; is also a somewhat autobiographical work, as Larson incorporated many elements of his life into his show. Larson lived in New York for many years as a starving artist with an uncertain future. He sacrificed a life of stability for his art, and shared many of the same hopes and fears as his characters. Like his characters he endured poor living conditions, and some of these conditions (e.g. illegal wood-burning stove, bathtub in the middle of his kitchen, broken buzzer [his guests had to call from the pay phone across the street and he would throw down the keys, as in &quot;Rent&quot;]) made their way into the musical . Part of the motivation behind the storyline in which Maureen leaves Mark for a woman (Joanne) is based on the fact that Larson&#x27;s own girlfriend left him for a woman. The Mark Cohen character is based on Larson&#x27;s friends, cinematographer and producer Jonathan Burkhart and documentary filmmaker Eddie Rosenstein.

Playwright Sarah Schulman alleged that &quot;Rent&quot; bore striking similarities to her novel &quot;People in Trouble&quot;. Schulman&#x27;s 1998 book &quot;Stagestruck: Theater, AIDS, and the Marketing of Gay America&quot; details these similarities and discusses her critiques of the musical.

The line, &quot;I&#x27;m more of a man than you&#x27;ll ever be... and more of a woman than you&#x27;ll ever get!&quot;, attributed to Angel Dumott Schunard at her funeral, was previously used by the character Hollywood Montrose, who appeared in the films &quot;Mannequin&quot; (1987) and &quot;Mannequin Two: On the Move&quot; (1991). Like Angel, Hollywood performs a song and dance number and sometimes wears women&#x27;s clothing. This line was originally in the film &quot;Car Wash&quot; (1976), delivered by Antonio Fargas as a flamboyant homosexual cross dresser named Lindy.

The earliest concepts of the characters differ largely from the finished products. Everyone except Mark had AIDS, including Maureen and Joanne; Maureen was a serious, angry character who played off Oedipus in her performance piece instead of Hey Diddle Diddle; Mark was, at one point, a painter instead of a filmmaker; Roger was named Ralph and wrote musical plays; Angel was a jazz philosopher, while Collins was a street performer; Angel and Collins were both originally described as Caucasian; and Benny had a somewhat enlarged role in the story, taking part in songs like &quot;Real Estate&quot;, which was later cut.

Many actual locations and events are included in, or are the inspiration for, elements of the musical. Life Café, where the &quot;La Vie Bohème&quot; numbers are set, was an actual restaurant (closed 2013) on 10th Street and Avenue B in the East Village of New York City. The riot at the end of the first act is based on the East Village riot in 1988 that arose as a result of the city-imposed curfew in Tompkins Square Park.

&quot;Will I?&quot;, a song which takes place during a Life Support meeting and expresses the pain and fear of living a life with AIDS, was inspired by a real event. Larson attended a meeting of Friends in Deed, an organization that helps people deal with illness and grief, much like Life Support. After that first time, Larson attended the meetings regularly. During one meeting, a man stood up and said that he was not afraid of dying. He did say, however, that there was one thing of which he was afraid: Would he lose his dignity? From this question stemmed the first line of this song. The people present at the Life Support meeting in the show, such as Gordon, Ali and Pam, carry the names of Larson&#x27;s friends who died. In the Broadway show, the names of the characters in that particular scene (they introduce themselves) were changed nightly to honor the friends of the cast members who were living with or had died from AIDS.

The scene and song &quot;Life Support&quot; were also based on Friends in Deed, as well as on Gordon, Pam, and Ali. Originally, the members of Life Support had a solid block of the &quot;forget regret&quot; refrain, and they talked about remembering love. When Jonathan&#x27;s HIV positive friends heard this scene, they told him that having AIDS was not so easy to accept: it made you angry and resentful too, and the song did not match that. Jonathan then added a part where Gordon says that he has a problem with this &quot;credo...my T-cells are low, I regret that news, okay?&quot; Paul, the leader of the meeting, replies, &quot;Okay...but, Gordon, how do you feel today?&quot; Gordon admits that he is feeling the best that he has felt all year. Paul asks, &quot;Then why choose fear?&quot; Gordon says, &quot;I&#x27;m a New Yorker. Fear&#x27;s my life.&quot;

==Lynn Thomson lawsuit==
Lynn Thomson was a dramaturge who was hired by New York Theatre Workshop to help rework &quot;Rent&quot;. She claimed that between early May and the end of October 1995, she and Larson co-wrote a &quot;new version&quot; of the musical, and that she had a verbal agreement with Larson to a percentage of the royalties. She sued Jonathan Larson&#x27;s estate for $40 million and sought 16 percent of the show&#x27;s royalties, ultimately losing that suit. A revised suit claiming she had written a significant portion of the lyrics and the libretto of the &quot;new version&quot; of &quot;Rent&quot; was filed later. The estate settled out of court.

During the trial, according to a partner in the firm representing the Larson estate, Thomson could not recall the lyrics to the songs that she allegedly wrote, nor the structures of the libretto she claimed to have created. The judge ruled against her and gave Larson&#x27;s estate full credit and right to &quot;Rent&quot;. A federal appellate court upheld the original ruling on appeal. In the judgement, the court ruled against Thompson saying &quot;she had brought the wrong suit.&quot; Thompson had sued over a verbal agreement she claimed to have with Larson, which she could not prove. However, the court stated in the judgment that her claim to have written some of the material in RENT, including the lyrics to the song &quot;Glory,&quot; was credible and that she had standing to sue for ownership of some of the material in RENT. She filed suit with revised claims. In August 1998, the case was settled out of court. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===

On Christmas Eve in Manhattan&#x27;s East Village, two roommates—Mark, a filmmaker, and Roger, a rock musician—struggle to stay warm and produce their art (&quot;Tune Up #1&quot;). Mark&#x27;s mother leaves him a voicemail wishing him a Merry Christmas and trying to comfort him since his ex-girlfriend Maureen dumped him (&quot;Voice Mail #1&quot;). Their friend Tom Collins, a gay anarchist professor of computer-age philosophy at New York University, calls and plans to surprise them at their apartment, but is mugged before entering. At the same time, Mark and Roger&#x27;s former roommate and friend Benny, who has since become their harsh new landlord, has reneged on an earlier agreement and now demands last year&#x27;s rent, before shutting down their electrical power (&quot;Tune Up #2&quot;). However, Mark and Roger stubbornly resolve against paying the rent, which they were promised would not be a problem (&quot;Rent&quot;). Meanwhile, Angel, a cross-dressing street drummer (presently out of drag), finds Collins wounded in an alley and tends to him (&quot;You Okay Honey?&quot;) - the two are immediately attracted to each other, each learning that the other is HIV positive. It is revealed that Roger also has HIV, which he contracted from his last girlfriend, who died by suicide after learning of her diagnosis, causing Roger to fall into depression. Mark leaves the loft while Roger stays home (&quot;Tune Up #3&quot;), trying to compose on his guitar without success; he wishes desperately to write one last song to be remembered by before he dies (&quot;One Song Glory&quot;). Their neighbor Mimi, an exotic dancer and drug addict, arrives at their apartment asking for help with lighting her candle, flirting with Roger in the process; however, he is clearly hesitant to return her affections (&quot;Light My Candle&quot;). Meanwhile, Joanne, a lawyer and Maureen&#x27;s girlfriend, receives a voicemail from her parents (&quot;Voice Mail #2&quot;).

At last, the missing Collins enters the apartment, presenting Angel, who is now in full drag; she amusingly shares the money she earned from killing an affluent couple&#x27;s dog by loudly playing nonstop for an hour (&quot;Today 4 U&quot;). Mark comes home, and Benny arrives, speaking of Maureen&#x27;s upcoming protest against his plans to evict the homeless from a lot where he is hoping to build a cyber arts studio. Benny offers that, if they can successfully convince Maureen to cancel the protest, then Mark and Roger can officially remain rent-free tenants. However, the two rebuff Benny&#x27;s offer and he leaves (&quot;You&#x27;ll See&quot;). Mark leaves the loft again to go help Maureen with the sound equipment for the protest, unexpectedly meeting Joanne at the stage. Initially hesitant with each other, the two eventually bond over their shared distrust of Maureen&#x27;s &quot;gaslighting&quot; and promiscuous behavior (&quot;Tango: Maureen&quot;). Mark then joins Collins and Angel to film their HIV support group meeting (&quot;Life Support&quot;), while Mimi attempts to seduce Roger alone in his apartment (&quot;Out Tonight&quot;). Extremely upset by Mimi&#x27;s intrusion, he demands that she leave him alone and resists any romantic feelings he may harbor for her (&quot;Another Day&quot;). After Mimi leaves, Roger reflects on his fear of dying an undignified death from AIDS, while the Life Support group echoes his thoughts (&quot;Will I&quot;).

Collins, Mark, and Angel protect a homeless woman from police harassment using Mark&#x27;s camera, but she chastises them, believing their intent was for Mark to make a name for himself from her situation (&quot;On the Street&quot;). To lighten the mood, Collins talks about his dream of escaping New York City to open a restaurant in Santa Fe (&quot;Santa Fe&quot;). Soon, Mark leaves to check up on Roger; while alone, Collins and Angel confess their love for each other (&quot;I&#x27;ll Cover You&quot;). Joanne hectically prepares for Maureen&#x27;s show, trying to balance the simultaneous multiple calls (&quot;We&#x27;re Okay&quot;). Before the performance, Roger apologizes to Mimi, inviting her to come to the protest and the dinner party his friends are having afterwards. At the same time, police, vendors, and homeless people prepare for the protest (&quot;Christmas Bells&quot;). Maureen performs in an avant-garde, if not over-the-top, manner, basing her piece on &quot;Hey Diddle Diddle&quot; (&quot;Over the Moon&quot;). At the post-show party at the Life Café, Benny arrives, criticizing the protest and the group&#x27;s bohemian lifestyle while also revealing that his wife Alison&#x27;s Akita, Evita, died due to Angel&#x27;s actions; Mark and his group defiantly respond by celebrating their status (&quot;La Vie Bohème&quot;). Mimi and Roger each discover that the other is HIV-positive and hesitantly decide to continue their relationship (&quot;I Should Tell You&quot;). At the end of the Act, Joanne explains that Mark and Roger&#x27;s building has been padlocked and a riot has broken out; Roger and Mimi, unaware of the violence, share their first kiss. The celebration continues (&quot;La Vie Bohème B&quot;).

===Act II===
The cast lines up to sing together before the plot of the second act begins, affirming that one should measure life &quot;in love&quot; (&quot;Seasons of Love&quot;). On New Year&#x27;s Eve, Mark, Mimi, Roger, Maureen, Joanne, Collins and Angel gather to break back into Mark and Roger&#x27;s apartment which they have been locked out of. (&quot;Happy New Year&quot;). Once Mark, Joanne and Maureen break in through the window, a voicemail reveals that Mark&#x27;s footage of the riot has earned him a job offering at a tabloid news company called Buzzline (&quot;Voice Mail #3&quot;). The others finally break through the door just as Benny arrives, saying he wants to call a truce and revealing that Mimi, a former girlfriend of his, convinced him to change his mind. Mimi denies rekindling her relationship with Benny, but Roger is upset, and although they apologize to each other, Mimi goes to her drug dealer for a fix (&quot;Happy New Year B&quot;).

Around Valentine&#x27;s Day, Mark tells the audience that Roger and Mimi have been living together, Collins and Angel are nowhere to be found, and Maureen and Joanne are preparing another protest; during rehearsal, Maureen criticizes Joanne&#x27;s controlling behavior, while Joanne criticizes Maureen&#x27;s promiscuity. They break up dramatically following an ultimatum (&quot;Take Me or Leave Me&quot;). Time progresses to spring (&quot;Seasons of Love B&quot;), where Roger and Mimi&#x27;s relationship is strained by Mimi&#x27;s escalating heroin usage and Roger&#x27;s lasting jealousy and suspicion of Benny. Each alone, Roger and Mimi sing of love and loneliness, telling each other how they feel, as they watch Collins nurse Angel, whose health is declining due to AIDS (&quot;Without You&quot;). By the end of the summer, Mark continues to receive calls offering a corporate job at Buzzline (&quot;Voice Mail #4&quot;). A dance is performed representing all the couples&#x27; sex lives (&quot;Contact&quot;). At the climax of the number, the two former couples break up, and Angel suddenly dies in Collins&#x27; arms. At the funeral, the friends briefly come together to share their memories, with Collins being the last to reminisce (&quot;I&#x27;ll Cover You [Reprise]&quot;). Mark expresses his fear of being the sole survivor when his friends eventually die of AIDS, and he finally accepts the corporate job offer (&quot;Halloween&quot;). Roger reveals that he is leaving for Santa Fe, which sparks an argument about commitment between him and Mimi, while Maureen and Joanne argue. Collins arrives and admonishes the entire group for fighting on the day of Angel&#x27;s funeral, causing Maureen and Joanne to reconcile, but not Mimi and Roger. The group share a sad moment, knowing that between deaths and leaving, their close-knit friendships will become undone. Everyone leaves except Mark and Roger, where Mark tries to convince Roger to stay in New York. Roger, unable to handle Mimi&#x27;s declining health, becomes furious with Mark and leaves. Mimi returns to say goodbye, overhearing everything Roger had said and, terrified, agrees to go to rehab, which Benny pays for (&quot;Goodbye Love&quot;). Collins is forcibly removed from the church for being unable to pay for Angel&#x27;s funeral; Benny shows compassion by paying and offering Mark and Collins drinks. Collins accepts, causing the latter and Benny to rekindle their old friendship, but Mark turns down the offer due to work commitments.

Some time later, both Mark and Roger simultaneously reach an artistic epiphany, as Roger finds his song in Mimi and Mark finds his film in Angel&#x27;s memory; Roger decides to return to New York in time for Christmas, while Mark quits his job to devote his efforts to working on his own film (&quot;What You Own&quot;). The characters&#x27; parents, concerned and confused about their respective situations, leave several worried messages on their answering machines (&quot;Voice Mail #5&quot;). On Christmas Eve, exactly one year having passed, Mark prepares to screen his now-completed film to his friends. Roger has written his song, but apparently, Mimi is missing, and no one has seen her. Benny&#x27;s wife, discovering Benny&#x27;s past relationship with Mimi, has pulled him out of the East Village. The power suddenly blows and Collins enters with handfuls of cash, revealing that he reprogrammed an ATM at a grocery store to provide money to anybody with the code &#x27;ANGEL&#x27;. Maureen and Joanne abruptly enter carrying Mimi, who had been homeless and is now weak and close to death. She begins to fade, telling Roger that she loves him (&quot;Finale&quot;). Roger tells her to hold on as he plays her the song he wrote for her, revealing the depth of his feelings for her (&quot;Your Eyes&quot;). Mimi appears to die, but abruptly awakens, claiming to have been heading into a white light before a vision of Angel appeared, telling her to go back and stay with Roger. The remaining friends gather together in a final moment of shared happiness and resolve to enjoy whatever time they have left with each other, affirming that there is &quot;no day but today&quot; (&quot;Finale B&quot;).

==Roles==

===Main characters===

* Mark Cohen: A struggling Jewish-American documentary filmmaker and the narrator of the show. He is Roger&#x27;s roommate; at the start of the show, he has recently been dumped by Maureen.
* Roger Davis: A once-successful-but-now-struggling musician and ex-lead singer and rock guitarist who is HIV-positive and an ex-junkie. He hopes to write one last meaningful song before he dies. He has difficulty coping with his own mortality as well as that of his friends. His girlfriend, April, killed herself after finding out that she was HIV-positive. He is roommates with Mark.
* Mimi Márquez: A Latina stripper and drug addict. She lives downstairs from Mark and Roger, is Roger&#x27;s love interest, and, like him, is HIV-positive. She is also Benny&#x27;s ex-lover.
* Tom Collins: An anarchist professor with AIDS. He is described by Mark as a &quot;computer genius, teacher, and vagabond anarchist who ran naked through the Parthenon.&quot; Collins dreams of opening a restaurant in Santa Fe, where the problems in New York will not affect him and his friends. He was formerly a roommate of Roger, Mark, Benny, and Maureen, now just Roger and Mark, until he moves out.
* Angel Dumott Schunard: A young drag queen who is addressed as female when in drag and as male when out of drag. Angel, who has AIDS, is a street percussionist with a generous disposition as well as Collins&#x27; love interest.
* : A performance artist who is Mark&#x27;s ex-girlfriend and Joanne&#x27;s current girlfriend. She is very flirtatious and cheated on Mark. Larson considered Maureen a lesbian, despite her previous relationships with men, and he specifically identified her as &quot;lesbian&quot; in the script itself.
* Joanne Jefferson: An Ivy League-educated public interest lawyer and a lesbian. Joanne is the woman for whom Maureen left Mark. Joanne has very politically powerful parents (one is undergoing confirmation to be a judge, the other is a government official).

== Reception ==
&quot;Rent&quot; received several awards including a Pulitzer Prize and four Tony Awards.

Critical reception of &quot;Rent&quot; was positive not only for its acting and musical components, but also for its representation of HIV-positive individuals. Many critics praised the portrayal of characters such as Angel and Collins as being happy, with positive outlooks on life, rather than being resigned to death. While critics and theatre patrons had largely positive reviews of the show, it was criticized for its stereotypically negative portrayal of lesbian characters and the &quot;glamourization&quot; of the East Village in the late 1980s.

Billy Aronson said, &quot;For the record, although I was ambivalent about Jonathan&#x27;s ideas for &quot;Rent&quot; when we were working together on it, I have come to love the show. And as tragic as it is that he didn&#x27;t live to see his work become a huge success, I believe he knew it would be. In our last conversation I asked how the show was going and he said, with complete assurance, that it was incredible.&quot;

==Cultural impact and legacy==
The song &quot;Seasons of Love&quot; became a successful pop song and often is performed on its own. Because of its connection to New Years and looking back at times past, it is sometimes performed at graduations or school holiday programs.

===RENT-heads===
&quot;Rent&quot; gathered a following of fans who refer to themselves as &quot;RENT-heads&quot;. The name originally referred to people who would camp out at the Nederlander Theater for hours in advance for the discounted $20 rush tickets to each show, though it generally refers to anyone who is obsessed with the show. These discounted tickets were for seats in the first two rows of the theater reserved for sale by lottery two hours prior to each show. Other Broadway shows have followed &quot;Rent&quot;″s example and now also offer cheaper tickets in efforts to make Broadway theater accessible to people who would otherwise be unable to afford the ticket prices.

===Popular culture references===
The film &quot;Team America: World Police&quot; includes a character who plays a lead role in &quot;Lease&quot;, a Broadway musical parody of &quot;Rent&quot;. In 2017, the song &quot;Out Tonight&quot; was covered by the characters Josie and the Pussycats in an episode of the television series &quot;Riverdale&quot;. Satirist Randy Rainbow parodied &quot;Seasons of Love&quot; as &quot;Seasons of Trump&quot; for his 2021 look back at the Trump administration, and &quot;Tango: Maureen&quot; as &quot;Tango: Vaccine&quot; to highlight purveyors of COVID-19 misinformation.

&quot;Rent&quot; has also been referenced in other musicals. Yitzhak in &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; wears a &quot;Rent&quot; T-shirt and speaks of his aspiration to play the role of Angel. The off-Broadway musical revue &quot;Forbidden Broadway Strikes Back&quot; includes parodies of &quot;Rent&quot; songs such as &quot;Rant&quot; (&quot;Rent&quot;), &quot;Ouch! They&#x27;re Tight&quot; (&quot;Out Tonight&quot;), &quot;Season of Hype&quot; (&quot;Seasons of Love&quot;), &quot;Too Gay 4 U (Too Het&#x27;ro 4 Me)&quot; (&quot;Today 4 U&quot;), &quot;Pretty Voices Singing&quot; (&quot;Christmas Bells&quot;) and &quot;This Ain&#x27;t Boheme&quot; (&quot;La Vie Bohème&quot;). Lin-Manuel Miranda, the composer and writer of the Broadway show &quot;Hamilton&quot;, has cited &quot;Rent&quot; as a main source of inspiration. He also referenced the show in a verse of the song &quot;Wrote My Way Out&quot; on &quot;The Hamilton Mixtape&quot; in the line &quot;Running out of time like I&#x27;m Jonathan Larson&#x27;s rent check&quot;.

==Productions==

===New York workshops and Off-Broadway production===
&quot;Rent&quot; had its first staged reading at New York Theatre Workshop in March 1993. A further two-week New York Theatre Workshop version was performed in 1994 starring Anthony Rapp as Mark and Daphne Rubin-Vega as Mimi, and more workshops followed. The show opened in 1996, again at New York Theatre Workshop, and quickly gained popularity off-Broadway, receiving enthusiastic reviews. &quot;The New York Times&quot; theater critic Ben Brantley called it an &quot;exhilarating, landmark rock opera&quot; with a &quot;glittering, inventive score&quot; that &quot;shimmers with hope for the future of the American musical.&quot; Another reviewer wrote, &quot;&quot;Rent&quot; speaks to Generation X the way that the musical &quot;Hair&quot; spoke to the baby boomers or those who grew up in the 1960s,&quot; while the &quot;New York Times&quot; similarly called it &quot;a rock opera for our time, a &quot;Hair&quot; for the 90s.&quot; The show proved extremely successful off-Broadway, selling out all of its performances at the 150-seat theatre. 

===Original Broadway production===

Due to its overwhelming popularity and the need for a larger theater, &quot;Rent&quot; moved to Broadway&#x27;s previously derelict Nederlander Theatre on 41st Street on April 29, 1996. On Broadway, the show achieved critical acclaim and word-of-mouth popularity. The production&#x27;s ethnically diverse principal cast originally included Taye Diggs, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, Jesse L. Martin, Idina Menzel, Adam Pascal, Anthony Rapp, Daphne Rubin-Vega and Fredi Walker.

The production&#x27;s controversial topics and innovative pricing, including same day-of-performance $20 tickets, helped to increase the popularity of musical theater amongst the younger generation. The production was nominated for ten Tony Awards in 1996 and won four: Best Musical, Best Book, Best Original Score and Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical (Heredia).

On April 24, 2006, the original Broadway cast reunited for a one-night performance of the musical at the Nederlander Theatre. This performance raised over $2,000,000 for the Jonathan Larson Performing Arts Foundation, Friends In Deed and New York Theatre Workshop. Former cast members were invited, and many from prior tours and former Broadway casts appeared, performing an alternate version of &quot;Seasons of Love&quot; as the finale of the performance.

&quot;Rent&quot; closed on September 7, 2008, after a 12-year run and 5,123 performances, making it the seventh-longest-running Broadway show at that time, and currently the eleventh-longest-running Broadway show. The production grossed over $280 million.

Original cast ensemble members Rodney Hicks and Gwen Stewart returned to the cast at the time of the Broadway closing. Hicks played Benny and Stewart played the role she created, the soloist in the song &quot;Seasons of Love&quot;. In addition, actress Tracie Thoms joined the cast at the end of the run playing Joanne, the role she portrayed in the 2005 film version. The last Broadway performance was filmed and screened in movie theaters as &quot;Rent: Filmed Live on Broadway&quot; in September 2008. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray formats on February 3, 2009.

===North American touring productions===
Successful United States national tours, the &quot;Angel Tour&quot; and the &quot;Benny Tour&quot;, launched in the 1990s. Later, the non-Equity tour started its run. There was also a Canadian tour (often referred to as the &quot;Collins Tour&quot;).

The Angel tour began in November 1996 at the Shubert Theatre in Boston, where it ran for approximately six months. Anthony Rapp joined the cast for the Chicago run, and Daphne Rubin-Vega joined for the Los Angeles run. The tour finished in San Francisco in September 1999. Other members of the Angel cast included Carrie Hamilton, Amy Spanger, Luther Creek, Kristoffer Cusick, Lisa Simone, Queen Esther, and Tony Vincent.

The Benny Tour began in July 1997 in San Diego, California, at the LaJolla Playhouse. Michael Grief, the original director of the Broadway show was also the artistic director of the LaJolla Playhouse and was instrumental in arranging for the Benny tour to begin in the smaller city of San Diego rather than Los Angeles, California. It originally featured Neil Patrick Harris as Mark Cohen in his first musical theatre role. The Benny tour generally played shorter stops and often-smaller markets than the Angel Tour did. Other cast members included Wilson Cruz and d&#x27;Monroe.

Tours ran each season from 2005 to 2008. Cast members throughout the run included Aaron Tveit, Ava Gaudet, Declan Bennett, Rebecca Naomi Jones, Constantine Maroulis, Dan Rosenbaum, Heinz Winckler, Anwar Robinson, Christine Dwyer, Caissie Levy and Karen Olivo. In 2009, a national tour starring Adam Pascal and Anthony Rapp, reprising their original Broadway roles, launched in Cleveland, Ohio. Original Broadway Cast member Gwen Stewart also appeared, alongside Michael McElroy as Collins, The tour ended on February 7, 2010, in Sacramento, California. A 20th anniversary non-Equity touring production began in Bloomington, Indiana on September 12, 2016, and ran through March 1, 2020. A 25th anniversary non-Equity tour kicked off on September 30, 2021, at the Carson Center in Paducah, Kentucky.

===UK productions===
The show made its UK premiere on April 21, 1998, at the West End&#x27;s Shaftesbury Theatre and officially opened on May 12, 1998. The original cast included Krysten Cummings as Mimi Marquez, Wilson Jermaine Heredia as Angel Schunard, Bonny Lockhart as Benny, Jesse L. Martin as Tom Collins, Adam Pascal as Roger Davis, Anthony Rapp as Mark Cohen, and Jessica Tezier as Maureen Johnson. The show closed on October 30, 1999, after one-and-a-half years. Limited revivals took place at the Prince of Wales Theatre from December 4, 2001, to January 6, 2002; December 6, 2002, to March 1, 2003 (featuring Adam Rickett as Mark and Caprice as Maureen). There was also a successful production for a limited run in Manchester in 2006 with an additional &#x27;goodbye&#x27; performance in 2008 from the Manchester cast.

On October 16, 2007, the heavily revised production titled &quot;Rent Remixed&quot; opened at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. Directed by William Baker, it was set in the present day. The cast included Oliver Thornton (Mark), Luke Evans (Roger), Craig Stein (Benny), Leon Lopez (Collins), Francesca Jackson (Joanne), Jay Webb (Angel), Siobhán Donaghy (Mimi), and Denise Van Outen (Maureen). From December 24, 2007, the role of Maureen was played by Jessie Wallace. The production received generally unfavorable reviews. The Guardian gave it only one out of five stars, writing, &quot;They call this &#x27;Rent Remixed&#x27;. I&#x27;d dub it &#x27;Rent Reduced&#x27;, in that the late Jonathan Larson&#x27;s reworking of La Bohème, while never a great musical, has been turned into a grisly, synthetic, pseudo pop concert with no particular roots or identity.&quot; The production closed on February 2, 2008.

The production radically altered elements of the musical including defining the characters of Mimi, Angel and Mark as British. Songs were reordered (including Maureen&#x27;s first appearance as the Act I finale). The rehaul of the score was masterminded by Steve Anderson and featured radically rearranged versions of Out Tonight, Today 4 U, Over the Moon and Happy New Year.

A one-off Rent - The 20th Anniversary Concert was held at the Blackpool Opera house Monday November 11, 2013. A 20th anniversary tour opened at Theatr Clwyd in October 2016 before playing a two-month run at the St James Theatre, London. The cast included Layton Williams as Angel and Lucie Jones as Maureen. The production then continued to tour the UK.

In 2018 an immersive production of RENT premiered at Frogmore Paper Mill in Apsley, Hemel Hempstead. The cast included Aran Macrae (Roger), Connor Dyer (Mark) and Lizzie Emery (Mimi). The show opened on July 10, 2018, and ran until July 28.

In 2020, the musical was revived at Manchester&#x27;s Hope Mill Theatre for a limited run from October 30 to December 6. The production was originally scheduled to begin in late July but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the ongoing pandemic, the audience was socially distanced and measures were in place around the theatre. The cast included Blake Patrick Anderson (Mark), Tom Francis (Roger), Maiya Quansah-Breed (Mimi), Dom Hartley-Harris (Collins), Alex Thomas-Smith (Angel), Millie O&#x27;Connell (Maureen), Jocasta Almgill (Joanne), and Ahmed Hamad (Benny). The production was professionally filmed, which was broadcast from November 27 to December 20 on weekends.

===Off-Broadway revival===
The show was revived off-Broadway at Stage 1 of New World Stages with previews starting July 14, 2011, and a scheduled opening of August 11, 2011. This was the first New York Revival of the show since the original production closed less than three years earlier. The production was directed by &quot;Rent&quot;&#x27;s original director Michael Greif. Almost the entire show was different from the original, yet the reinvention did not please the critics, who complained that the new actors did not have a feel for the characters they were playing and that it made the show feel contrived. The off-Broadway production of &quot;Rent&quot; closed on September 9, 2012.

===Additional productions===
In 1999, an Australian production featured Justin Smith as Mark, Rodger Corser as Roger and Christine Anu as Mimi. The tour began in Sydney and finished in Melbourne.

The Swedish production premiered in January, 2001 at Göta Lejon, Sweden, with an extensive national tour the following year. Sarah Dawn Finer played Joanne. The first Swedish production had an altered ending, later productions has kept the original ending.

&quot;Rent&quot; veteran Neil Patrick Harris directed a production at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, CA. The production played a three night engagement, August 6–8, 2010. The cast included Vanessa Hudgens as Mimi, Aaron Tveit as Roger, Skylar Astin as Mark, Wayne Brady as Collins, Telly Leung as Angel, Tracie Thoms as Joanne, Nicole Scherzinger as Maureen, Collins Pennie as Benny, and Gwen Stewart as Seasons of Love soloist (and additional roles).

In 2017, the first tour for the German speaking countries was mounted by Berlin theatrical producer . The leading German musical theatre magazine &quot;musicals - Das Musicalmagazin&quot; described the production as &quot;in terms of vocal quality, the performance was one of the best that has ever been seen in Germany&quot; (issue 188 of Dec 2017). The show traveled Germany, Austria and Switzerland and was directed by the British opera director Walter Sutcliffe.

===&quot;Rent: School Edition&quot;===
In 2007, an abridged edition of &quot;Rent&quot; was made available to five non-professional acting groups in the United States for production, primarily adapted by Jennifer and Peter Jones of Stuart, Florida&#x27;s StarStruck Theatre. Billed as , this version omits the song &quot;Contact&quot; and eliminates some of the coarse language and tones down some public displays of affection in the original. Shorewood High School in Shorewood, Wisconsin, became the first high school to perform an early version of the adaptation in May 2006. The high school was selected to present a workshop performance as part of Music Theatre International&#x27;s work to adapt the musical for younger actors and potentially more conservative audiences. As of 2008, Music Theatre International began licensing &quot;&quot;Rent&quot; School Edition&quot; for performances by schools and non-professional amateur theaters in the United States and around the world.

<text>A restaurant is an establishment that prepares and serves food and drinks to customers. Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services. Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive fast-food restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced luxury establishments.

==Etymology==
The word derives from the early 19th century, taken from the French word &#x27;provide meat for&#x27;, literally &#x27;restore to a former state&#x27; and, being the present participle of the verb, the term &quot;restaurant&quot; may have been used in 1507 as a &quot;restorative beverage&quot;, and in correspondence in 1521 to mean &#x27;that which restores the strength, a fortifying food or remedy&#x27;.

==History==
A public eating establishment similar to a restaurant is mentioned in a 512 BC record from Ancient Egypt. It served only one dish, a plate of cereal, wildfowl, and onions.

A forerunner for the modern restaurant is the thermopolium, an establishment in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome that sold and served ready-to-eat food and beverages. These establishments were somewhat similar in function to modern fast food restaurants. They were most often frequented by people who lacked private kitchens. In the Roman Empire, they were popular among residents of insulae.

In Pompeii, 158 thermopolia with service counters have been identified throughout the town. They were concentrated along the main axis of the town and the public spaces where they were frequented by the locals. 

The Romans also had the popina, a wine bar which in addition to a variety of wines offered a limited selection of simple foods such as olives, bread, cheese, stews, sausage, and porridge. The popinae were known as places for the plebeians of the lower classes of Roman society to socialize. While some were confined to one standing room only, others had tables and stools and a few even had couches.

Another early forerunner of the restaurant was the inn. Throughout the ancient world, inns were set up alongside roads to cater to people travelling between cities, offering lodging and food. Meals were typically served at a common table to guests. However, there were no menus or options to choose from.

Early eating establishments recognizable as restaurants in the modern sense emerged in Song dynasty China during the 11th and 12th centuries. In large cities, such as Kaifeng and Hangzhou, food catering establishments catered to merchants who travelled between cities. Probably growing out of tea houses and taverns which catered to travellers, Kaifeng&#x27;s restaurants blossomed into an industry that catered to locals as well as people from other regions of China. As travelling merchants were not used to the local cuisine of other cities, these establishments were set up to serve dishes familiar to merchants from other parts of China. Such establishments were located in the entertainment districts of major cities, alongside hotels, bars, and brothels. The larger and more opulent of these establishments offered a dining experience similar to modern restaurant culture. According to a Chinese manuscript from 1126, patrons of one such establishment were greeted with a selection of pre-plated demonstration dishes which represented food options. Customers had their orders taken by a team of waiters who would then sing their orders to the kitchen and distribute the dishes in the exact order in which they had been ordered.

There is a direct correlation between the growth of the restaurant businesses and institutions of theatrical stage drama, gambling and prostitution which served the burgeoning merchant middle class during the Song dynasty. Restaurants catered to different styles of cuisine, price brackets, and religious requirements. Even within a single restaurant choices were available, and people ordered the entrée from written menus. An account from 1275 writes of Hangzhou, the capital city for the last half of the dynasty:
The restaurants in Hangzhou also catered to many northern Chinese who had fled south from Kaifeng during the Jurchen invasion of the 1120s, while it is also known that many restaurants were run by families formerly from Kaifeng.

In Japan, a restaurant culture emerged in the 16th century out of local tea houses. Tea house owner Sen no Rikyū created the &quot;kaiseki&quot; multi-course meal tradition, and his grandsons expanded the tradition to include speciality dishes and cutlery which matched the aesthetic of the food.

In Europe, inns which offered food and lodgings and taverns where food was served alongside alcoholic beverages were common into the Middle Ages and Renaissance. They typically served common fare of the type normally available to peasants. In Spain, such establishments were called &quot;bodegas&quot; and served tapas. In England, they typically served foods such as sausage and shepherd&#x27;s pie. Cookshops were also common in European cities during the Middle Ages. These were establishments which served dishes such as pies, puddings, sauces, fish, and baked meats. Customers could either buy a ready-made meal or bring their own meat to be cooked. As only large private homes had the means for cooking, the inhabitants of European cities were significantly reliant on them.

France in particular has a rich history with the development of various forms of inns and eateries, eventually to form many of the now-ubiquitous elements of the modern restaurant. As far back as the thirteenth century, French inns served a variety of food — bread, cheese, bacon, roasts, soups, and stews - usually eaten at a common table. Parisians could buy what was essentially take-out food from &quot;rôtisseurs&quot;, who prepared roasted meat dishes, and pastry-cooks, who could prepare meat pies and often more elaborate dishes. Municipal statutes stated that the official prices per item were to be posted at the entrance; this was the first official mention of menus.

Taverns also served food, as did cabarets. A cabaret, however, unlike a tavern, served food at tables with tablecloths, provided drinks with the meal, and charged by the customers&#x27; choice of dish, rather than by the pot. Cabarets were reputed to serve better food than taverns and a few, such as the Petit Maure, became well known. A few cabarets had musicians or singing, but most, until the late 19th century, were simply convivial eating places. The first café opened in Paris in 1672 at the Saint-Germain fair. By 1723 there were nearly four hundred cafés in Paris, but their menu was limited to simpler dishes or confectionaries, such as coffee, tea, chocolate (the drink; chocolate in solid state was invented only in the 19th century), ice creams, pastries, and liqueurs.

At the end of the 16th century, the guild of cook-caterers (later known as &quot;traiteurs&quot;) was given its own legal status. The &quot;traiteurs&quot; dominated sophisticated food service, delivering or preparing meals for the wealthy at their residences. Taverns and cabarets were limited to serving little more than roast or grilled meats. Towards the end of the seventeenth century, both inns and then traiteurs began to offer &quot;host&#x27;s tables&quot; (&quot;tables d&#x27;hôte&quot;), where one paid a set price to sit at a large table with other guests and eat a fixed menu meal.

==Modern format==
The earliest modern-format &quot;restaurants&quot; to use that word in Paris were the establishments which served bouillon, a broth made of meat and egg which was said to restore health and vigour. The first restaurant of this kind was opened in 1765 or 1766 by Mathurin Roze de Chantoiseau on rue des Poulies, now part of the Rue de Louvre. The name of the owner is sometimes given as Boulanger. Unlike earlier eating places, it was elegantly decorated, and besides meat broth offered a menu of several other &quot;restorative&quot; dishes, including macaroni. Chantoiseau and other chefs took the title &quot;traiteurs-restaurateurs&quot;. While not the first establishment where one could order food, or even soups, it is thought to be the first to offer a menu of available choices.

In the Western world, the concept of a restaurant as a public venue where waiting staff serve patrons food from a fixed menu is a relatively recent one, dating from the late 18th century. 

In June 1786, the Provost of Paris issued a decree giving the new kind of eating establishment official status, authorising &quot;restaurateurs&quot; to receive clients and to offer them meals until eleven in the evening in winter and midnight in summer. Ambitious cooks from noble households began to open more elaborate eating places. The first luxury restaurant in Paris, the La Grande Taverne de Londres, was opened at the Palais-Royal at the beginning of 1786 by Antoine Beauvilliers, the former chef of the Count of Provence. It had mahogany tables, linen tablecloths, chandeliers, well-dressed and trained waiters, a long wine list and an extensive menu of elaborately prepared and presented dishes. Dishes on its menu included partridge with cabbage, veal chops grilled in buttered paper, and duck with turnips. This is considered to have been the &quot;first real restaurant&quot;. According to Brillat-Savarin, the restaurant was &quot;the first to combine the four essentials of an elegant room, smart waiters, a choice cellar, and superior cooking&quot;.

The aftermath of the French Revolution saw the number of restaurants skyrocket. Due to the mass emigration of nobles from the country, many cooks from aristocratic households who were left unemployed went on to found new restaurants. One restaurant was started in 1791 by Méot, the former chef of the Duke of Orleans, which offered a wine list with twenty-two choices of red wine and twenty-seven of white wine. By the end of the century there were a collection of luxury restaurants at the Grand-Palais: Huré, the Couvert espagnol; Février; the Grotte flamande; Véry, Masse and the Café de Chartres (still open, now Le Grand Véfour).

In 1802 the term was applied to an establishment where restorative foods, such as bouillon, a meat broth, were served (&quot;établissement de restaurateur&quot;). The closure of culinary guilds and societal changes resulting from the Industrial Revolution contributed significantly to the increased prevalence of restaurants in Europe.

== Types of restaurants ==

In the 1980s and 1990s the restaurant industry was revolutionized by entrepreneurs, including Terence Conran, Christopher Bodker, Alan Yau, and Oliver Peyton. Today restaurants are classified or distinguished in many different ways. The primary factor is usually the food itself e.g. vegetarianism, seafood, or steak. The origin of the cuisine may be also used to categorize restaurants e.g. Italian, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, French, Mexican, or Thai. The style of offering has become an important distinguishing factor in the restaurant industry e.g. tapas, sushi, buffet, or yum cha. Beyond this, restaurants may differentiate themselves on factors including speed of service e.g. fast food. Theme restaurants and automated restaurant have become big players in the restaurant industry and may include fine dining, casual dining, contemporary casual, family style, fast casual, coffeehouse, concession stands, food trucks, pop-up restaurants, and ghost restaurants.

Restaurants range from inexpensive and informal lunching or dining places catering to people working nearby, with modest food served in simple settings at low prices, to expensive establishments serving refined food and fine wines in a formal setting. In the former case, customers usually wear casual clothing. In the latter case, depending on culture and local traditions, customers might wear semi-casual, semi-formal or formal wear. Typically, at mid- to high-priced restaurants, customers sit at tables, their orders are taken by a waiter, who brings the food when it is ready. After eating, the customers then pay the bill. In some restaurants, such as those in workplaces, there are usually no waiters; the customers use trays, on which they place cold items that they select from a refrigerated container and hot items which they request from cooks, and then they pay a cashier before they sit down. Another restaurant approach which uses few waiters is the buffet restaurant. Customers serve food onto their own plates and then pay at the end of the meal. Buffet restaurants typically still have waiters to serve drinks and alcoholic beverages. Fast food establishments are also considered to be restaurants. In addition, food trucks are another popular option for people who want quick food service.

Tourists around the world can enjoy dining services on railway dining cars and cruise ship dining rooms, which are essentially travelling restaurants. Many railway dining services also cater to the needs of travellers by providing railway refreshment rooms at railway stations. Many cruise ships provide a variety of dining experiences including a main restaurant, satellite restaurants, room service, speciality restaurants, cafes, bars and buffets to name a few. Some restaurants on these cruise ships require table reservations and operate specific dress codes.

== Restaurant staff ==
A restaurant&#x27;s proprietor is called a &quot;&quot;, this derives from the French verb &quot;restaurer&quot;, meaning &quot;to restore&quot;. Professional cooks are called chefs, with there being various finer distinctions (e.g. sous-chef, chef de partie). Most restaurants (other than fast food restaurants and cafeterias) will have various waiting staff to serve food, beverages and alcoholic drinks, including busboys who remove used dishes and cutlery. In finer restaurants, this may include a host or hostess, a maître d&#x27;hôtel to welcome customers and seat them, and a sommelier or wine waiter to help patrons select wines. A new route to becoming a restaurateur, rather than working one&#x27;s way up through the stages, is to operate a food truck. Once a sufficient following has been obtained, a permanent restaurant site can be opened. This trend has become common in the UK and the US.

===Chef&#x27;s table===
A chef&#x27;s table is a table located in the kitchen of a restaurant, reserved for VIPs and special guests. Patrons may be served a themed tasting menu prepared and served by the head chef. Restaurants can require a minimum party and charge a higher flat fee.

== By country ==

===Europe===
====France====
France has a long tradition with public eateries and modern restaurant culture emerged there. In the early 19th century, traiteurs and restaurateurs became known simply as &quot;restaurateurs&quot;. The use of the term &quot;restaurant&quot; for the establishment itself only became common in the 19th century.

According to the legend, the first mention to a restaurant dates back to 1765 in Paris. It was located on Rue des Poulies, now Rue du Louvre, and use to serve dishes known as &quot;restaurants&quot;. The place was run by a man named Mr. Boulanger. However, according to the Larousse Gastronomique, La Grande Taverne de Londres which opened in 1782 is considered as the first Parisian restaurant. 

The first restaurant guide, called &quot;Almanach des Gourmands&quot;, written by Grimod de La Reyniére, was published in 1804. During the French Restoration period, the most celebrated restaurant was the Rocher de Cancale, frequented by the characters of Balzac. In the middle of the century, Balzac&#x27;s characters moved to the Café Anglais, which in 1867 also hosted the famous Three Emperors Dinner hosted by Napoleon III in honor of Tsar Alexander II, Kaiser Wilhelm I and Otto von Bismarck during the Exposition Universelle in 1867 
Other restaurants that occupy a place in French history and literature include Maxim&#x27;s and Fouquet&#x27;s. The restaurant of Hotel Ritz Paris, opened in 1898, was made famous by its chef, Auguste Escoffier. The 19th century also saw the appearance of new kinds of more modest restaurants, including the bistrot. The brasserie featured beer and was made popular during the 1867 Paris Exposition.

=== North America ===
==== United States ====


In the United States, it was not until the late 18th century that establishments that provided meals without also providing lodging began to appear in major metropolitan areas in the form of coffee and oyster houses. The actual term &quot;restaurant&quot; did not enter into the common parlance until the following century. Prior to being referred to as &quot;restaurants&quot; these eating establishments assumed regional names such as &quot;eating house&quot; in New York City, &quot;restorator&quot; in Boston, or &quot;victualling house&quot; in other areas. Restaurants were typically located in populous urban areas during the 19th century and grew both in number and sophistication in the mid-century due to a more affluent middle class and to urbanization. The highest concentration of these restaurants were in the West, followed by industrial cities on the Eastern Seaboard.

When Prohibition went into effect in 1920, restaurants offering fine dining had a hard time making ends meet because they had depended on profits from selling wine and alcoholic beverages. Replacing them were establishments offering simpler, more casual experiences such as cafeterias, roadside restaurants, and diners. When Prohibition ended in the 1930s, luxury restaurants slowly started to appear again as the economy recovered from the Great Depression.

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed segregation based on race, color, religion, or national origin in all public accommodations engaged in interstate commerce, including restaurants. &quot;Katzenbach v. McClung&quot;, 379 U.S. 294 (1964), was a decision of the US Supreme Court which held that Congress acted within its power under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution in forbidding racial discrimination in restaurants as this was a burden to interstate commerce.

In the 1970s, there was one restaurant for every 7,500 persons. In 2016, there were 1,000,000 restaurants; one for every 310 people. The average person eats out five to six times weekly. 3.3% of the nation&#x27;s workforce is composed of restaurant workers. According to a Gallup Poll in 2016, nearly 61% of Americans across the country eat out at a restaurant once a week or more, and this percent is only predicted to increase in future years. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, The National Restaurant Association estimated restaurant sales of $899 billion in 2020. The association now projects that the pandemic will decrease that to $675 billion, a decline of $274 billion over their previous estimate.

=== South America ===
==== Brazil ====
In Brazil, restaurant varieties mirror the multitude of nationalities that arrived in the country: Japanese, Arab, German, Italian, Portuguese and many more.

==== Colombia ====
The word &quot;piquete&quot; can be used to refer to a common Colombian type of meal that includes meat, yuca and potatoes, which is a type of meal served at a piqueteadero. The verb form of the word piquete, piquetear, means to participate in binging, liquor drinking, and leisure activities in popular areas or open spaces.

==== Peru ====
In Peru, many indigenous, Spanish, and Chinese dishes are frequently found. Because of recent immigration from places such as China, and Japan, there are many Chinese and Japanese restaurants around the country, especially in the capital city of Lima.

== Guides ==
Restaurant guides review restaurants, often ranking them or providing information to guide consumers (type of food, handicap accessibility, facilities, etc.). One of the most famous contemporary guides is the Michelin series of guides which accord one to three stars to restaurants they perceive to be of high culinary merit. Restaurants with stars in the Michelin guide are formal, expensive establishments; in general the more stars awarded, the higher the prices.

The main competitor to the Michelin guide in Europe is the guidebook series published by Gault Millau. Its ratings are on a scale of 1 to 20, with 20 being the highest.

In the United States, the Forbes Travel Guide (previously the Mobil travel guides) and the AAA rate restaurants on a similar 1 to 5 star (Forbes) or diamond (AAA) scale. Three, four, and five star/diamond ratings are roughly equivalent to the Michelin one, two, and three star ratings while one and two star ratings typically indicate more casual places to eat. In 2005, Michelin released a New York City guide, its first for the United States. The popular Zagat Survey compiles individuals&#x27; comments about restaurants but does not pass an &quot;official&quot; critical assessment. 

Nearly all major American newspapers employ food critics and publish online dining guides for the cities they serve. Some news sources provide customary reviews of restaurants, while others may provide more of a general listings service.

More recently Internet sites have started up that publish both food critic reviews and popular reviews by the general public.

== Economics ==

=== Canada ===
There are 86,915 commercial food service units in Canada, or 26.4 units per 10,000 Canadians. By segment, there are:
* 38,797 full-service restaurants
* 34,629 limited-service restaurants
* 741 contract and social caterers
* 6,749 drinking places

Fully 63% of restaurants in Canada are independent brands. Chain restaurants account for the remaining 37%, and many of these are locally owned and operated franchises.

=== European Union ===
The EU-27 has an estimated 1.6m businesses involved in &#x27;accommodation &amp; food services&#x27;, more than 75% of which are small and medium enterprises.

=== India ===
The Indian restaurant industry is highly fragmented with more than 1.5 million outlets of which only around 3000 of them are from the organised segment. The organised segment includes quick service restaurants; casual dining; cafes; fine dining; and pubs, bars, clubs, and lounges.

=== Vietnam ===
The restaurant industry in Vietnam is one of the important economic sectors, making a significant contribution to the national economy. According to the General Statistics Office of Vietnam, the number of restaurants in Vietnam has increased rapidly from 2000 to 2022. In 2000, there were about 20,000 restaurants nationwide, but by 2022, this number had increased to over 400,000 restaurants. The average annual growth rate is about 10%. The restaurant industry in Vietnam has also seen strong growth in recent years. According to a report by SSI Securities Corporation, the revenue of the restaurant industry in Vietnam reached VND610 trillion in 2022, up 16% from 2021. Of that, the out-of-home market accounted for VND333.69 trillion, up 19% from 2021.
=== United States ===
As of 2006, there are approximately 215,000 full-service restaurants in the United States, accounting for $298 billion in sales, and approximately 250,000 limited-service (fast food) restaurants, accounting for $260 billion. Starting in 2016, Americans spent more on restaurants than groceries.
In October 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported there are 620,000 eating and drinking places in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics. They also reported that the number of restaurants are growing almost twice as fast as the population.

One study of new restaurants in Cleveland, Ohio found that 1 in 4 changed ownership or went out of business after one year, and 6 out of 10 did so after three years. (Not all changes in ownership are indicative of financial failure.) The three-year failure rate for franchises was nearly the same.

Restaurants employed 912,100 cooks in 2013, earning an average $9.83 per hour. The waiting staff numbered 4,438,100 in 2012, earning an average $8.84 per hour.

Jiaxi Lu of the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reports in 2014 that, &quot;Americans are spending $683.4 billion a year dining out, and they are also demanding better food quality and greater variety from restaurants to make sure their money is well spent.&quot;

Dining in restaurants has become increasingly popular, with the proportion of meals consumed outside the home in restaurants or institutions rising from 25% in 1950 to 46% in 1990. This is caused by factors such as the growing numbers of older people, who are often unable or unwilling to cook their meals at home and the growing number of single-parent households. It is also caused by the convenience that restaurants can afford people; the growth of restaurant popularity is also correlated with the growing length of the work day in the US, as well as the growing number of single parent households. Eating in restaurants has also become more popular with the growth of higher income households. At the same time, less expensive establishments such as fast food establishments can be quite inexpensive, making restaurant eating accessible to many.

==== Employment ====
The restaurant industry in the United States is large and quickly growing, with 10 million workers. 1 in every 12 U.S. residents work in the business, and during the 2008 recession, the industry was an anomaly in that it continued to grow. Restaurants are known for having low wages, which they claim are due to thin profit margins of 4-5%. For comparison, however, Walmart has a 1% profit margin.
As a result of these low wages, restaurant employees suffer from three times the poverty rate as other U.S. workers, and use food stamps twice as much.
Restaurants are the largest employer of people of color, and rank as the second largest employer of immigrants. These workers statistically are concentrated in the lowest paying positions in the restaurant industry. In the restaurant industry, 39% of workers earn minimum wage or lower.

== Regulations ==
In many countries, restaurants are subject to inspections by health inspectors to maintain standards for public health, such as maintaining proper hygiene and cleanliness. The most common kind of violations of inspection reports are those concerning the storage of cold food at appropriate temperatures, proper sanitation of equipment, regular hand washing and proper disposal of harmful chemicals. Simple steps can be taken to improve sanitation in restaurants. As sickness is easily spread through touch, restaurants are encouraged to regularly wipe down tables, door knobs and menus.

Depending on local customs, legislation and the establishment, restaurants may or may not serve alcoholic beverages. Restaurants are often prohibited from selling alcoholic beverages without a meal by alcohol sale laws; such sale is considered to be an activity for bars, which are meant to have more severe restrictions. Some restaurants are licensed to serve alcohol (&quot;fully licensed&quot;), or permit customers to &quot;bring your own booze&quot; (BYO / BYOB). In some places restaurant licenses may restrict service to beer, or wine and beer.

== Occupational hazards ==
Food service regulations have historically been built around hygiene and protection of the consumer&#x27;s health. However, restaurant workers face many health hazards such as long hours, low wages, minimal benefits, discrimination, high stress, and poor working conditions. Along with the COVID-19 pandemic, much attention has been drawn to the prevention of community transmission in restaurants and other public settings. To reduce airborne disease transmission, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends reduced dining capacity, face masks, adequate ventilation, physical barrier instalments, disinfection, signage, and flexible leave policies for workers.

<text>Rolf Herman Nevanlinna (né Neovius; 22 October 1895 – 28 May 1980) was a Finnish mathematician who made significant contributions to complex analysis.

==Background==
Nevanlinna was born Rolf Herman Neovius, becoming Nevanlinna in 1906 when his father changed the family name.

The Neovius-Nevanlinna family contained many mathematicians: Edvard Engelbert Neovius (Rolf&#x27;s grandfather) taught mathematics and topography at a military academy; Edvard Rudolf Neovius (Rolf&#x27;s uncle) was a professor of mathematics at the University of Helsinki from 1883 to 1900; Lars Theodor Neovius-Nevanlinna (Rolf&#x27;s uncle) was an author of mathematical textbooks; and Otto Wilhelm Neovius-Nevanlinna (Rolf&#x27;s father) was a physicist, astronomer and mathematician.

After Otto obtained his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Helsinki, he studied at the Pulkovo Observatory with the German astronomer Herman Romberg, whose daughter, Margarete Henriette Louise Romberg, he married in 1892. Otto and Margarete then settled in Joensuu, where Otto taught physics, and there their four children were born: Frithiof (born 1894; also a mathematician), Rolf (born 1895), Anna (born 1896) and Erik (born 1901).

==Education==
Nevanlinna began his formal education at the age of 7. Having already been taught to read and write by his parents, he went straight into the second grade but still found the work boring and soon refused to attend the school. He was then homeschooled before being sent to a grammar school in 1903 when the family moved to Helsinki, where his father took up a new post as a teacher at Helsinki High School. At the new school, Nevanlinna studied French and German in addition to the languages he already spoke: Finnish and Swedish. He also attended an orchestra school and had a love of music, which was encouraged by his mother:

Nevanlinna then progressed onto the Helsinki High School, where his main interests were classics and mathematics. He was taught by a number of teachers during this time but the best of them all was his own father, who taught him physics and mathematics. He graduated in 1913 having performed very well, although he was not the top student of his year. He then went beyond the school syllabus in the summer of 1913 when he read Ernst Leonard Lindelöf&#x27;s &quot;Introduction to Higher Analysis&quot;; from that time on, Nevanlinna had an enthusiastic interest in mathematical analysis. (Lindelöf was also a cousin of Nevanlinna&#x27;s father, and so a part of the Neovius-Nevanlinna mathematical family.)

Nevanlinna began his studies at the University of Helsinki in 1913, and received his Master of Philosophy in mathematics in 1917. Lindelöf taught at the university and Nevanlinna was further influenced by him. During his time at the University of Helsinki, World War I was underway and Nevanlinna wanted to join the 27th Jäger Battalion, but his parents convinced him to continue with his studies. He did however join the White Guard in the Finnish Civil War, but did not see active military action. In 1919, Nevanlinna presented his thesis, entitled &quot;Über beschränkte Funktionen die in gegebenen Punkten vorgeschriebene Werte annehmen&quot; (&quot;On limited functions prescribed values at given points&quot;), to Lindelöf, his doctoral advisor. The thesis, which was on complex analysis, was of high quality and Nevanlinna was awarded his Doctor of Philosophy on 2 June 1919.

==Career==
When Nevanlinna earned his doctorate in 1919, there were no university posts available so he became a school teacher. His brother, Frithiof, had received his doctorate in 1918 but likewise was unable to take up a post at a university, and instead began working as a mathematician for an insurance company. Frithiof recruited Rolf to the company, and Nevanlinna worked for the company and as a school teacher until he was appointed a Docent of Mathematics at the University of Helsinki in 1922. During this time, he had been contacted by Edmund Landau and requested to move to Germany to work at the University of Göttingen, but did not accept.

After his appointment as Docent of Mathematics, he gave up his insurance job but did not resign his position as school teacher until he received a newly created full professorship at the university in 1926. Despite this heavy workload, it was between the years of 1922–25 that he developed what would become to be known as Nevanlinna theory.

From 1947 Nevanlinna had a chair in the University of Zurich, which he held on a half-time basis after receiving in 1948 a permanent position as one of the 12 salaried Academicians in the newly created Academy of Finland.

Rolf Nevanlinna&#x27;s most important mathematical achievement is the &quot;value distribution theory&quot; of meromorphic functions. The roots of the theory go back to the result of Émile Picard in 1879, showing that a non-constant complex-valued function which is analytic in the entire complex plane assumes all complex values save at most one. In the early 1920s Rolf Nevanlinna, partly in collaboration with his brother Frithiof, extended the theory to cover meromorphic functions, i.e. functions analytic in the plane except for isolated points in which the Laurent series of the function has a finite number of terms with a negative power of the variable. Nevanlinna&#x27;s value distribution theory or Nevanlinna theory is crystallised in its two &quot;Main Theorems&quot;. Qualitatively, the first one states that if a value is assumed less frequently than average, then the function comes close to that value more often than average. The Second Main Theorem, more difficult than the first one, states roughly that there are relatively few values which the function assumes less often than average.

Rolf Nevanlinna&#x27;s article &quot;Zur Theorie der meromorphen Funktionen&quot; which contains the Main Theorems was published in 1925 in the journal Acta Mathematica. Hermann Weyl has called it &quot;one of the few great mathematical events of the [twentieth] century.&quot; Nevanlinna gave a fuller account of the theory in the monographs &quot;Le théoreme de Picard – Borel et la théorie des fonctions méromorphes&quot; (1929) and &quot;Eindeutige analytische Funktionen&quot; (1936).

Nevanlinna theory touches also on a class of functions called the Nevanlinna class, or functions of &quot;bounded type&quot;.
When the Winter War broke out (1939), Nevanlinna was invited to join the Finnish Army&#x27;s Ballistics Office to assist in improving artillery firing tables. These tables had been based on a calculation technique developed by General Vilho Petter Nenonen, but Nevanlinna now came up with a new method which made them considerably faster to compile. In recognition of his work he was awarded the Order of the Cross of Liberty, Second Class, and throughout his life he held this honour in especial esteem.

Among Rolf Nevanlinna&#x27;s later interests in mathematics were the theory of Riemann surfaces (the monograph &quot;Uniformisierung&quot; in 1953) and functional analysis (&quot;Absolute analysis&quot; in 1959, written in collaboration with his brother Frithiof). Nevanlinna also published in Finnish a book on the foundations of geometry and a semipopular account of the Theory of Relativity. His Finnish textbook on the elements of complex analysis, &quot;Funktioteoria&quot; (1963), written together with Veikko Paatero, has appeared in German, English and Russian translations.

Rolf Nevanlinna supervised at least 28 doctoral theses. His first and most famous doctoral student was Lars Ahlfors, one of the first two Fields Medal recipients. The research for which Ahlfors was awarded the prize (proving the Denjoy Conjecture, now known as the Denjoy–Carleman–Ahlfors theorem) was strongly based on Nevanlinna&#x27;s work.

Nevanlinna&#x27;s work was recognised in the form of honorary degrees which he held from the universities of Heidelberg, the University of Bucharest, the University of Giessen, the Free University of Berlin, the University of Glasgow, the University of Uppsala, the University of Istanbul and the University of Jyväskylä. He was an honorary member of several learned societies, among them the London Mathematical Society and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. — The 1679 Nevanlinna main belt asteroid is named after him.

==Administrative activities==
From 1954, Rolf Nevanlinna chaired the committee which set about the first computer project in Finland. 

Rolf Nevanlinna served as President of the International Mathematical Union (IMU) from 1959 to 1963 and as President of the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 1962.

In 1964, Nevanlinna&#x27;s connections with President Urho Kekkonen were instrumental in bringing about a total reorganization of the Academy of Finland.

From 1965 to 1970 Nevanlinna was Chancellor of the University of Turku.

==Political activities==
Although Nevanlinna did not participate actively in politics, he was known to sympathise with the right-wing Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement and, partly because of his half-German parentage, was also sympathetic towards Nazi Germany; with many mathematics professors fired in the 1930s due to the Nuremberg Laws, mathematicians sympathetic to the Nazi policies were sought as replacements, and Nevanlinna accepted a position as professor at the University of Göttingen in 1936 and 1937. His sympathy towards the Nazis led to his removal from his position as Rector of the University of Helsinki after Finland made peace with the Soviet Union in 1944.

In the spring of 1941, Finland contributed a Volunteer Battalion to the Waffen-SS. In 1942, a committee was established for the Volunteer Battalion to take care of the battalion&#x27;s somewhat strained relations with its German commanders, and Nevanlinna was chosen to be the chairman of the committee, as he was a person respected in Germany but loyal to Finland. He stated in his autobiography that he accepted this role due to a &quot;sense of duty&quot;.

Nevanlinna&#x27;s collaboration with Nazi Germany did not prevent mathematical contacts with Allied countries; after World War II, the Soviet mathematical community was isolated from the Western mathematical community and the International Colloquium on Function Theory in Helsinki in 1957, directed by Nevanlinna, was one of the first post-war occasions when Soviet mathematicians could contact their Western colleagues in person. In 1965, Nevanlinna was an honorary guest at a function theory congress in Soviet Armenia.

== IMU Abacus Medal (formerly Nevanlinna Prize)==

When the IMU in 1981 decided to create a prize, similar to the Fields Medal, in theoretical computer science and the funding for the prize was secured from Finland, the Union decided to give Nevanlinna&#x27;s name to the prize; the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize is awarded every four years at the ICM. In 2018, the General Assembly of the IMU approved a resolution to remove Nevanlinna&#x27;s name from the prize. Starting in 2022 the prize has been called the IMU Abacus Medal.

<text>The red panda (Ailurus fulgens), also known as the lesser panda, is a small mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. It has dense reddish-brown fur with a black belly and legs, white-lined ears, a mostly white muzzle and a ringed tail. Its head-to-body length is with a tail, and it weighs between . It is well adapted to climbing due to its flexible joints and curved semi-retractile claws.

The red panda was formally described in 1825. The two currently recognised subspecies, the Himalayan and the Chinese red panda, genetically diverged about 250,000 years ago. The red panda&#x27;s place on the evolutionary tree has been debated, but modern genetic evidence places it in close affinity with raccoons, weasels, and skunks. It is not closely related to the giant panda, which is a bear, though both possess elongated wrist bones or &quot;false thumbs&quot; used for grasping bamboo. The evolutionary lineage of the red panda (Ailuridae) stretches back around , as indicated by extinct fossil relatives found in Eurasia and North America.

The red panda inhabits coniferous forests as well as temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, favouring steep slopes with dense bamboo cover close to water sources. It is solitary and largely arboreal. It feeds mainly on bamboo shoots and leaves, but also on fruits and blossoms. Red pandas mate in early spring, with the females giving birth to litters of up to four cubs in summer. It is threatened by poaching as well as destruction and fragmentation of habitat due to deforestation. The species has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2015. It is protected in all range countries.

Community-based conservation programmes have been initiated in Nepal, Bhutan and northeastern India; in China, it benefits from nature conservation projects. Regional captive breeding programmes for the red panda have been established in zoos around the world. It is featured in animated movies, video games, comic books and as the namesake of companies and music bands.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name &quot;panda&quot; is uncertain, but one of the most likely theories is that it derived from the Nepali word &quot;ponya&quot;. The word &#x27; or &#x27; means &quot;ball of the foot&quot; and &quot;claws&quot;. The Nepali words &quot;nigalya ponya&quot; has been translated as &quot;bamboo-footed&quot; and is thought to be the red panda&#x27;s Nepali name; in English, it was simply called &quot;panda&quot;, and was the only animal known under this name for more than 40 years; it became known as the &quot;red panda&quot; or &quot;lesser panda&quot; to distinguish it from the giant panda, which was formally described and named in 1869.

The genus name &quot;Ailurus&quot; is adopted from the Ancient Greek word &quot;&quot; meaning &#x27;cat&#x27;. The specific epithet &quot;fulgens&quot; is Latin for &#x27;shining, bright&#x27;.

== Taxonomy ==

The red panda was described and named in 1825 by Frederic Cuvier, who gave it its current scientific name &quot;Ailurus fulgens&quot;. Cuvier&#x27;s description was based on zoological specimens, including skin, paws, jawbones and teeth &quot;from the mountains north of India&quot;, as well as an account by Alfred Duvaucel. The red panda was described earlier by Thomas Hardwicke in 1821, but his paper was only published in 1827. In 1902, Oldfield Thomas described a skull of a male red panda specimen under the name &quot;Ailurus fulgens styani&quot; in honour of Frederick William Styan who had collected this specimen in Sichuan.

===Subspecies and species===
The modern red panda is the only recognised species in the genus &quot;Ailurus&quot;. It is traditionally divided into two subspecies: the Himalayan red panda (&quot;A. f. fulgens&quot;) and the Chinese red panda (&quot;A. f. styani&quot;). The Himalayan subspecies has a straighter profile, a lighter coloured forehead and ochre-tipped hairs on the lower back and rump. The Chinese subspecies has a more curved forehead and sloping snout, a darker coat with a less white face and more contrast between the tail rings.

In 2020, results of a genetic analysis of red panda samples showed that the red panda populations in the Himalayas and China were separated about 250,000 years ago. The researchers suggested that the two subspecies should be treated as distinct species. Red pandas in southeastern Tibet and northern Myanmar were found to be part of &quot;styani&quot;, while those of southern Tibet were of &quot;fulgens&quot; in the strict sense. DNA sequencing of 132 red panda faecal samples collected in Northeast India and China also showed two distinct clusters indicating that the Siang River constitutes the boundary between the Himalayan and Chinese red pandas. They probably diverged due to glaciation events on the southern Tibetan Plateau in the Pleistocene.

===Phylogeny===
The placement of the red panda on the evolutionary tree has been debated. In the early 20th century, various scientists placed it in the family Procyonidae with raccoons and their allies. At the time, most prominent biologists also considered the red panda to be related to the giant panda, which would eventually be found to be a bear. A 1982 study examined the similarities and differences in the skull between the red panda and the giant panda, other bears and procyonids, and placed the species in its own family Ailuridae. The author of the study considered the red panda to be more closely related to bears. A 1995 mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed that the red panda has close affinities with procyonids. Further genetic studies in 2005, 2018 and 2021 have placed the red panda within the clade Musteloidea, which also includes Procyonidae, Mustelidae (weasels and relatives) and Mephitidae (skunks and relatives).


===Fossil record===
The family Ailuridae appears to have evolved in Europe in either the Late Oligocene or Early Miocene, about . The earliest member &quot;Amphictis&quot; is known from its skull and may have been around the same size as the modern species. Its dentition consists of sharp premolars and carnassials (P4 and m1) and molars adapted for grinding (M1, M2 and m2), suggesting that it had a generalised carnivorous diet. Its placement within Ailuridae is based on the grooves on the side of its canine teeth. Other early or basal ailurids include &quot;Alopecocyon&quot; and &quot;Simocyon&quot;, whose fossils have been found throughout Eurasia and North America dating from the Middle Miocene, the latter of which survived into the Early Pliocene. Both have similar teeth to &quot;Amphictis&quot; and thus had a similar diet. The puma-sized &quot;Simocyon&quot; was likely a tree-climber and shared a &quot;false thumb&quot;—an extended wrist bone—with the modern species, suggesting the appendage was an adaptation to arboreal locomotion and not to feed on bamboo.

Later and more advanced ailurids are classified in the subfamily Ailurinae and are known as the &quot;true&quot; red pandas. These animals were smaller and more adapted for an omnivorous or herbivorous diet. The earliest known true panda is &quot;Magerictis&quot; from the Middle Miocene of Spain and known only from one tooth, a lower second molar. The tooth shows both ancestral and new characteristics having a relatively low and simple crown but also a lengthened crushing surface with developed tooth cusps like later species. Later ailurines include &quot;Pristinailurus bristoli&quot; which lived in eastern North America from the late Miocene to the Early Pliocene and species of the genus &quot;Parailurus&quot; which first appear in Early Pliocene Europe, spreading across Eurasia into North America. These animals are classified as a sister taxon to the lineage of the modern red panda. In contrast to the herbivorous modern species, these ancient pandas were likely omnivores, with highly cusped molars and sharp premolars.

The earliest fossil record of the modern genus &quot;Ailurus&quot; dates no earlier than the Pleistocene and appears to have been limited to Asia. The modern red panda&#x27;s lineage became adapted for a specialised bamboo diet, having molar-like premolars and more elevated cusps. The false thumb would secondarily gain a function in feeding.

===Genomics===
Analysis of 53 red panda samples from Sichuan and Yunnan showed a high level of genetic diversity. The full genome of the red panda was sequenced in 2017. Researchers have compared it to the genome of the giant panda to learn the genetics of convergent evolution, as both species have false thumbs and are adapted for a specialised bamboo diet despite having the digestive system of a carnivore. Both pandas show modifications to certain limb development genes (DYNC2H1 and PCNT), which may play roles in the development of the thumbs. In switching from a carnivorous to a herbivorous diet, both species have reactivated taste receptor genes used for detecting bitterness, though the specific genes are different.

==Description==

The red panda&#x27;s coat is mainly red or orange-brown with a black belly and legs. The muzzle, cheeks, brows and inner ear margins are mostly white while the bushy tail has red and buff ring patterns and a dark brown tip. The colouration appears to serve as camouflage in habitat with red moss and white lichen-covered trees. The guard hairs are longer and rougher while the dense undercoat is fluffier with shorter hairs. The guard hairs on the back have a circular cross-section and are long. It has moderately long whiskers around the mouth, lower jaw and chin. The hair on the soles of the paws allows the animal to walk in snow.

The red panda has a relatively small head, though proportionally larger than in similarly sized raccoons, with a reduced snout and triangular ears, and nearly evenly lengthed limbs. It has a head-body length of with a tail. The Himalayan red panda is recorded to weigh , while the Chinese red panda weighs for females and for males. It has five curved digits on each foot, each with curved semi-retractile claws that aid in climbing. The pelvis and hindlimbs have flexible joints, adaptations for an arboreal quadrupedal lifestyle. While not prehensile, the tail helps the animal balance while climbing.

The forepaws possess a &quot;false thumb&quot;, which is an extension of a wrist bone, the radial sesamoid found in many carnivorans. This thumb allows the animal to grip onto bamboo stalks and both the digits and wrist bones are highly flexible. The red panda shares this feature with the giant panda, which has a larger sesamoid that is more compressed at the sides. In addition, the red panda&#x27;s sesamoid has a more sunken tip while the giant panda&#x27;s curves in the middle. These features give the giant panda more developed dexterity.

The red panda&#x27;s skull is wide, and its lower jaw is robust. However, because it eats leaves and stems, which are not as tough, it has smaller chewing muscles than the giant panda. The digestive system of the red panda is only 4.2 times its body length, with a simple stomach, no noticeable divide between the ileum and colon, and no caecum.

Both sexes have paired anal glands that emit a secretion consisting of long-chain fatty acids, cholesterol, squalene and 2-Piperidinone; the latter is the most odoriferous compound and is perceived by humans as having an ammoniacal or pepper-like odour.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The red panda inhabits Nepal, the states of Sikkim, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh in India, Bhutan, southern Tibet, northern Myanmar and China&#x27;s Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. The global potential habitat of the red panda has been estimated to comprise at most; this habitat is located in the temperate climate zone of the Himalayas with a mean annual temperature range of . Throughout this range, it has been recorded at elevations of .

In Nepal, it lives in six protected area complexes within the Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests ecoregion. The westernmost records to date were obtained in three community forests in Kalikot District in 2019. Panchthar and Ilam Districts represent its easternmost range in the country, where its habitat in forest patches is surrounded by villages, livestock pastures and roads. The metapopulation in protected areas and wildlife corridors in the Kangchenjunga landscape of Sikkim and northern West Bengal is partly connected through old-growth forests outside protected areas. Forests in this landscape are dominated by Himalayan oaks (&quot;Quercus lamellosa&quot; and &quot;Q. semecarpifolia&quot;), Himalayan birch, Himalayan fir, Himalayan maple with bamboo, &quot;Rhododendron&quot; and some black juniper shrub growing in the understoreys. Records in Bhutan, Arunachal Pradesh&#x27;s Pangchen Valley, West Kameng and Shi Yomi districts indicate that it frequents habitats with &quot;Yushania&quot; and &quot;Thamnocalamus&quot; bamboo, medium-sized &quot;Rhododendron&quot;, whitebeam and chinquapin trees. In China, it inhabits the Hengduan Mountains subalpine conifer forests and Qionglai-Minshan conifer forests in the Hengduan, Qionglai, Xiaoxiang, Daxiangling and Liangshan Mountains in Sichuan. In the adjacent Yunnan province, it was recorded only in the northwestern montane part.

The red panda prefers microhabitats within of water sources. Fallen logs and tree stumps are important habitat features, as they facilitate access to bamboo leaves. Red pandas have been recorded to use steep slopes of more than 20° and stumps exceeding a diameter of . Red pandas observed in Phrumsengla National Park used foremost easterly and southerly slopes with a mean slope of 34° and a canopy cover of 66 per cent that were overgrown with bamboo about in height. In Dafengding Nature Reserve, it prefers steep south-facing slopes in winter and inhabits forests with bamboo tall. In Gaoligongshan National Nature Reserve, it inhabits mixed coniferous forest with a dense canopy cover of more than 75 per cent, steep slopes and a density of at least . In some parts of China, the red panda coexists with the giant panda. In Fengtongzhai and Yele National Nature Reserves, red panda microhabitat is characterised by steep slopes with lots of bamboo stems, shrubs, fallen logs and stumps, whereas the giant panda prefers gentler slopes with taller but lesser amounts of bamboo and less habitat features overall. Such niche separation lessens competition between the two bamboo-eating species.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The red panda is difficult to observe in the wild, and most studies on its behaviour have taken place in captivity. The red panda appears to be both nocturnal and crepuscular, sleeping in between periods of activity at night. It typically rests or sleeps in trees or other elevated spaces, stretched out prone on a branch with legs dangling when it is hot, and curled up with its hindlimb over the face when it is cold. It is adapted for climbing and descends to the ground head-first with the hindfeet holding on to the middle of the tree trunk. It moves quickly on the ground by trotting or bounding.

===Social spacing===
Adult pandas are generally solitary and territorial. Individuals mark their home range or territorial boundaries with urine, faeces and secretions from the anal and surrounding glands. Scent-marking is usually done on the ground, with males marking more often and for longer periods. In China&#x27;s Wolong National Nature Reserve, the home range of a radio-collared female was , while that of a male was . A one-year-long monitoring study of ten red pandas in eastern Nepal showed that the four males had median home ranges of and the six females of within a forest cover of at least . The females travelled per day and the males . In the mating season from January to March, adults travelled a mean of and subadults a mean of . They all had larger home ranges in areas with low forest cover and reduced their activity in areas that were disturbed by people, livestock and dogs.

===Diet and feeding===
The red panda is largely herbivorous and feeds primarily on bamboo, mainly the genera &quot;Phyllostachys&quot;, &quot;Sinarundinaria&quot;, &quot;Thamnocalamus&quot; and &quot;Chimonobambusa&quot;. It also feeds on fruits, blossoms, acorns, eggs, birds and small mammals. Bamboo leaves may be the most abundant food item year-round and the only food they can access during winter. In Wolong National Nature Reserve, leaves of the bamboo species &quot;Bashania fangiana&quot; were found in nearly 94 per cent of analysed droppings, and its shoots were found in 59 per cent of the droppings found in June.

The diet of red pandas monitored at three sites in Singalila National Park for two years consisted of 40–83 per cent &quot;Yushania maling&quot; and 51–91.2 per cent &quot;Thamnocalamus spathiflorus&quot; bamboos supplemented by bamboo shoots, &quot;Actinidia strigosa&quot; fruits and seasonal berries. In this national park, red panda droppings also contained remains of silky rose and bramble fruit species in the summer season, &quot;Actinidia callosa&quot; in the post-monsoon season, and &quot;Merrilliopanax alpinus&quot;, the whitebeam species &quot;Sorbus cuspidata&quot; and tree rhododendron in both seasons. Droppings were found with 23 plant species including the stone oak species &quot;Lithocarpus pachyphyllus&quot;, Campbell&#x27;s magnolia, the chinquapin species &quot;Castanopsis tribuloides&quot;, Himalayan birch, &quot;Litsea sericea&quot; and the holly species &quot;Ilex fragilis&quot;. In Nepal&#x27;s Rara National Park, &quot;Thamnocalamus&quot; was found in all the droppings sampled, both before and after the monsoon. Its summer diet in Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve also includes some lichens and barberries. In Bhutan&#x27;s Jigme Dorji National Park, red panda faeces found in the fruiting season contained seeds of Himalayan ivy.

The red panda grabs food with one of its front paws and usually eats sitting down or standing. When foraging for bamboo, it grabs the plant by the stem and pulls it down towards its jaws. It bites the leaves with the side of the cheek teeth and then shears, chews and swallows. Smaller food like blossoms, berries and small leaves are eaten differently, being clipped by the incisors. Having the gastrointestinal tract of a carnivore, the red panda cannot properly digest bamboo, which passes through its gut in two to four hours. Hence, it must consume large amounts of the most nutritious plant matter. It eats over of fresh leaves or of fresh shoots in a day with crude proteins and fats being the most easily digested. Digestion is highest in summer and fall but lowest in winter, and is easier for shoots than leaves. The red panda&#x27;s metabolic rate is comparable to other mammals of its size, despite its poor diet. The red panda digests almost a third of dry matter, which is more efficient than the giant panda digesting 17 per cent. Microbes in the gut may aid in its processing of bamboo; the microbiota community in the red panda is less diverse than in other mammals.

===Communication===

At least seven different vocalisations have been recorded from the red panda, comprising growls, barks, squeals, hoots, bleats, grunts and twitters. Growling, barking, grunting and squealing are produced during fights and aggressive chasing. Hooting is made in response to being approached by another individual. Bleating is associated with scent-marking and sniffing. Males may bleat during mating, while females twitter. During both play fighting and aggressive fighting, individuals curve their backs and tails while slowly moving their heads up and down. They then turn their heads while jaw-clapping, move their heads laterally and lift a forepaw to strike. They stand on their hind legs, raise the forelimbs above the head and then pounce. Two red pandas may &quot;stare&quot; at each other from a distance.

===Reproduction and parenting===

Red pandas are long-day breeders, reproducing after the winter solstice as daylight grows longer. Mating thus takes place from January to March, with births occurring from May to August. Reproduction is delayed by six months for captive pandas in the southern hemisphere. Oestrous lasts a day, and females can enter oestrous multiple times a season, but it is not known how long the intervals between each cycle last.

As the reproductive season begins, males and females interact more, and will rest, move, and feed near each other. An oestrous female will spend more time marking and males will inspect her anogenital region. Receptive females make tail-flicks and position themselves in a lordosis pose, with the front lowered to the ground and the spine curved. Copulation involves the male mounting the female from behind and on top, though face-to-face matings as well as belly-to-back matings while lying on the sides also occur. The male will grab the female by the sides with his front paws instead of biting her neck. Intromission is 2–25 minutes long, and the couple groom each other between each bout.

Gestation lasts about 131 days. Prior to giving birth, the female selects a denning site, such as a tree, log or stump hollow or rock crevice, and builds a nest using material from nearby, such as twigs, sticks, branches, bark bits, leaves, grass and moss. Litters typically consist of one to four cubs that are born fully furred but blind. They are entirely dependent on their mother for the first three to four months until they first leave the nest. They nurse for their first five months. The bond between mother and offspring lasts until the next mating season. Cubs are fully grown at around 12 months and at around 18 months they reach sexual maturity. Two radio-collared cubs in eastern Nepal separated from their mothers at the age of 7–8 months and left their birth areas three weeks later. They reached new home ranges within 26–42 days and became residents after exploring them for 42–44 days.

=== Mortality and diseases===
The red panda&#x27;s lifespan in captivity reaches 14 years. They have been recorded falling prey to leopards in the wild. Faecal samples of red panda collected in Nepal contained parasitic protozoa, amoebozoans, roundworms, trematodes and tapeworms. Roundworms, tapeworms and coccidia were also found in red panda scat collected in Rara and Langtang National Parks. Fourteen red pandas at the Knoxville Zoo suffered from severe ringworm, so the tails of two were amputated. Chagas disease was reported as the cause of death of a red panda kept in a Kansas zoo. &quot;Amdoparvovirus&quot; was detected in the scat of six red pandas in the Sacramento Zoo. Eight captive red pandas in a Chinese zoo suffered from shortness of breath and fever shortly before they died of pneumonia; autopsy revealed that they had antibodies to the protozoans &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; and &quot;Sarcocystis&quot; species indicating that they were intermediate hosts. A captive red panda in the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding died of unknown reasons; an autopsy showed that its kidneys, liver and lungs were damaged by a bacterial infection caused by &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;.

== Threats ==
The red panda is primarily threatened by the destruction and fragmentation of its habitat, the causes of which include increasing human population, deforestation, the unlawful taking of non-wood forest material and disturbances by herders and livestock. Trampling by livestock inhibits bamboo growth, and clearcutting decreases the ability of some bamboo species to regenerate. The cut lumber stock in Sichuan alone reached in 1958–1960, and around of red panda habitat were logged between the mid-1970s and late 1990s. Throughout Nepal, the red panda habitat outside protected areas is negatively affected by solid waste, livestock trails and herding stations, and people collecting firewood and medicinal plants. Threats identified in Nepal&#x27;s Lamjung District include grazing by livestock during seasonal transhumance, human-made forest fires and the collection of bamboo as cattle fodder in winter. Vehicular traffic is a significant barrier to red panda movement between habitat patches.

Poaching is also a major threat. In Nepal, 121 red panda skins were confiscated between 2008 and 2018. Traps meant for other wildlife have been recorded killing red pandas. In Myanmar, the red panda is threatened by hunting using guns and traps; since roads to the border with China were built starting in the early 2000s, red panda skins and live animals have been traded and smuggled across the border. In southwestern China, the red panda is hunted for its fur, especially for the highly valued bushy tails, from which hats are produced. The red panda population in China has been reported to have decreased by 40 per cent over the last 50 years, and the population in western Himalayan areas are considered to be smaller. Between 2005 and 2017, 35 live and seven dead red pandas were confiscated in Sichuan, and several traders were sentenced to 3–12 years of imprisonment. A month-long survey of 65 shops in nine Chinese counties in the spring of 2017 revealed only one in Yunnan offered hats made of red panda skins, and red panda tails were offered in an online forum.

== Conservation ==
The red panda is listed in CITES Appendix I and protected in all range countries; hunting is illegal. It has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2008 because the global population is estimated at 10,000 individuals, with a decreasing population trend. A large extent of its habitat is part of protected areas.


A red panda anti-poaching unit and community-based monitoring have been established in Langtang National Park. Members of Community Forest User Groups also protect and monitor red panda habitats in other parts of Nepal. Community outreach programs have been initiated in eastern Nepal using information boards, radio broadcasting and the annual International Red Panda Day in September; several schools endorsed a red panda conservation manual as part of their curricula.

Since 2010, community-based conservation programmes have been initiated in 10 districts in Nepal that aim to help villagers reduce their dependence on natural resources through improved herding and food processing practices and alternative income possibilities. The Nepali government ratified a five-year Red Panda Conservation Action Plan in 2019. From 2016 to 2019, of high-elevation rangeland in Merak, Bhutan, was restored and fenced in cooperation with 120 herder families to protect the red panda forest habitat and improve communal land. Villagers in Arunachal Pradesh established two community conservation areas to protect the red panda habitat from disturbance and exploitation of forest resources. China has initiated several projects to protect its environment and wildlife, including Grain for Green, The Natural Forest Protection Project and the National Wildlife/Natural Reserve Construction Project. For the last project, the red panda is not listed as a key species for protection but may benefit from the protection of the giant panda and golden snub-nosed monkey, with which it overlaps in range.

=== In captivity ===

The London Zoo received two red pandas in 1869 and 1876, the first of which was caught in Darjeeling. The Calcutta Zoo received a live red panda in 1877, the Philadelphia Zoo in 1906, and Artis and Cologne Zoos in 1908. In 1908, the first captive red panda cubs were born in an Indian zoo. In 1940, the San Diego Zoo imported four red pandas from India that had been caught in Nepal; their first litter was born in 1941. Cubs that were born later were sent to other zoos; by 1969, about 250 red pandas had been exhibited in zoos. The Taronga Conservation Society started keeping red pandas in 1977.

In 1978, a breed registry, the &quot;International Red Panda Studbook&quot;, was set up, followed by the Red Panda European Endangered Species Programme in 1985. Members of international zoos ratified a global master plan for the captive breeding of the red panda in 1993. By late 2015, 219 red pandas lived in 42 zoos in Japan. The Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park participates in the Red Panda Species Survival Plan and kept about 25 red pandas by 2016. By the end of 2019, 182 European zoos kept 407 red pandas. Regional captive breeding programmes have also been established in North American, Australasian and South African zoos.

== Cultural significance ==

The red panda&#x27;s role in the culture and folklore of local people is limited. A drawing of a red panda exists on a 13th-century Chinese scroll. In Nepal&#x27;s Taplejung District, red panda claws are used for treating epilepsy; its skin is used in rituals for treating sick people, making hats, scarecrows and decorating houses. In western Nepal, Magar shamans use its skin and fur in their ritual dresses and believe that it protects against evil spirits. People in central Bhutan consider red pandas to be reincarnations of Buddhist monks. Some tribal people in northeast India and the Yi people believe that it brings good luck to wear red panda tails or hats made of its fur. In China, the fur is used for local cultural ceremonies. At weddings, the bridegroom traditionally carries the hide. Hats made of red panda tails are also used by local newlyweds as a &quot;good-luck charm&quot;.

The red panda was recognised as the state animal of Sikkim in the early 1990s and was the mascot of the Darjeeling Tea Festival. It has been featured on stamps and coins issued by several red panda range states. Anthropomorphic red pandas feature in animated movies and TV series such as &quot;The White Snake Enchantress&quot;, &quot;Bamboo Bears&quot;, &quot;Barbie as the Island Princess&quot;, DreamWorks&#x27; &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot; franchise, &quot;Aggretsuko&quot; and Disney/Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Turning Red&quot;, and in several video games and comic books. It is the namesake of the Firefox browser and has been used as the namesake of music bands and of companies. Its appearance has been used for plush toys, t-shirts, postcards and other items.

<text>Roppongi (, , &#x27;six trees&#x27;) is a district of Minato, Tokyo, Japan, famous for the affluent Roppongi Hills development area and popular night club scene. A few foreign embassies are located near Roppongi, and the night life is popular with locals and foreigners alike. It is in the central part of Tokyo, south of Akasaka and north of Azabu.

==History==

The name &quot;Roppongi&quot;, which appears to have been coined around 1660, literally means &quot;six trees&quot;. Six very old and large zelkova trees used to mark the area; the first three were cleared, and the last were destroyed during World War II. Another legend has it that the name comes from the fact that six &quot;daimyōs&quot; lived nearby during the Edo period, each with the kanji character for &quot;tree&quot; or a kind of tree in their names. Roppongi was not extensively populated until after the Meiji Restoration, although the area was trafficked for centuries and served as the site of the cremation of Shōgun Tokugawa Hidetada&#x27;s wife in 1626.

In 1890, the Third Imperial Guard of the Imperial Japanese Army was moved to a site near Roppongi (now home to the Pacific bureau of &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;). The influx of soldiers led to the area&#x27;s rise as a nightlife district, briefly interrupted by the Great Kanto earthquake which flattened the area in 1923. Roppongi was administratively part of Azabu Ward from 1878 to 1947.
After World War II, during which the area was again destroyed, this time by aerial bombing raids, the United States Army and Allied government officials occupied several facilities in the area, beginning Roppongi&#x27;s reputation as a neighborhood with large numbers of non-Japanese. Several large US military installations were located in the nearby area, with Hardy Barracks probably the most significant (the US Embassy Housing Compound and Akasaka Press Center including Hardy Barracks Recreational Lodging, &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; office and heliport are still there). Surrounding the military installations were many Japanese-owned restaurants, pool halls, bars, and brothels which catered to US military personnel but were also often frequented by Japanese customers.

Starting in the late 1960s, Roppongi became popular among Japanese people and foreigners alike for its disco scene, which attracted many of Tokyo&#x27;s entertainment elites. Contributing to the international scene was the location of several foreign embassies and foreign corporate offices in the Roppongi area. However, many dance clubs shut down in the recession following the market crash of 1989.

The Roppongi area received a major economic boost in 2002–2003 when the Izumi Garden Tower and the Roppongi Hills high-rise complexes were completed. These projects brought high-end office and condominium space to Roppongi for the first time. The Tokyo Midtown project in neighbouring Akasaka, which was completed in 2006, and includes the first Tokyo Ritz-Carlton Hotel, continued this trend.
==Nightlife==
The area features numerous bars, nightclubs, strip clubs, restaurants, hostess clubs, cabarets, and other forms of entertainment. Among the expatriate community, the area tends to be favored by business people, students, and off-duty US military personnel. Overall, the neighborhood caters to a younger crowd.

Clubs can range from large, multi-level establishments, to smaller one-room clubs located in upper levels of buildings.
In more recent times some of the larger venues with known yakuza connections have closed.
 Around Roppongi crossing are a number of clubs which feature foreign performers. There are also a number of both foreign- and Japanese-operated bars catering to different crowds. Recently, Roppongi has enjoyed a growing reputation for its organized events such as art festivals, dart and billiard tournaments, pub crawls, robot exhibitions, beauty pageants, and so on.

Restaurants in Roppongi vary from upscale Japanese fare to popular international restaurants.

==Controversies==
In the past, Roppongi had a reputation as an area with high yakuza presence, whether as customers at Roppongi establishments, conducting business, or managing or owning clubs and bars in the area. Although still exerting some influence in Roppongi, in recent times they appear to have shifted much of their presence to other districts in the Tokyo area.

In 2006, Nigerian immigrants to Japan began opening a number of bars and nightclubs in the area, following an earlier group of innovators who had been in business in Roppongi for many years. The Nigerians were noted for using visible, high-pressure tactics to draw customers to their bars. In 2009 and 2010 a series of drink-spiking incidents, in which customers reported being drugged and robbed, were linked to Nigerian-owned bars. The incidents resulted in the United States embassy in Japan warning US citizens to avoid certain bars and clubs in Roppongi. An investigation by &quot;The Japan Times&quot; in July 2011 found that though drink spiking occurred, most of the incidents did not involve criminal activity. Many customers claimed unusually severe hangovers after nights spent in Nigerian-run establishments. Similar complaints are often made about non-Nigerian bars in Roppongi that offer unlimited drink packages and often lace drinks with hard liquor to minimize customer consumption and increase profit.

<doc id="26444" wikidata="Q1512" url="?curid=26444" title="Robert Louis Stevenson">
<text>Robert Louis Stevenson (born Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson; 13 November 1850 – 3 December 1894) was a Scottish novelist, essayist, poet and travel writer. He is best known for works such as &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;, &quot;Kidnapped&quot; and &quot;A Child&#x27;s Garden of Verses&quot;.

Born and educated in Edinburgh, Stevenson suffered from serious bronchial trouble for much of his life but continued to write prolifically and travel widely in defiance of his poor health. As a young man, he mixed in London literary circles, receiving encouragement from Sidney Colvin, Andrew Lang, Edmund Gosse, Leslie Stephen and W. E. Henley, the last of whom may have provided the model for Long John Silver in &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. In 1890, he settled in Samoa where, alarmed at increasing European and American influence in the South Sea islands, his writing turned from romance and adventure fiction toward a darker realism. He died of a stroke in his island home in 1894 at age 44.

A celebrity in his lifetime, Stevenson&#x27;s critical reputation has fluctuated since his death, though today his works are held in general acclaim. In 2018, he was ranked just behind Charles Dickens as the 26th-most-translated author in the world.

==Family and education==
===Childhood and youth===

Stevenson was born at 8 Howard Place, Edinburgh, Scotland, on 13 November 1850 to Thomas Stevenson (1818–1887), a leading lighthouse engineer, and his wife, Margaret Isabella (born Balfour, 1829–1897). He was christened Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson. At about age 18, he changed the spelling of &quot;Lewis&quot; to &quot;Louis&quot;, and he dropped &quot;Balfour&quot; in 1873.

Lighthouse design was the family&#x27;s profession; Thomas&#x27;s father (Robert&#x27;s grandfather) was the civil engineer Robert Stevenson, and Thomas&#x27;s brothers (Robert&#x27;s uncles) Alan and David were in the same field. Thomas&#x27;s maternal grandfather Thomas Smith had been in the same profession. However, Robert&#x27;s mother&#x27;s family were gentry, tracing their lineage back to Alexander Balfour, who had held the lands of Inchrye in Fife in the fifteenth century. His mother&#x27;s father, Lewis Balfour (1777–1860), was a minister of the Church of Scotland at nearby Colinton, and her siblings included physician George William Balfour and marine engineer James Balfour. Stevenson spent the greater part of his boyhood holidays in his maternal grandfather&#x27;s house. &quot;Now I often wonder what I inherited from this old minister,&quot; Stevenson wrote. &quot;I must suppose, indeed, that he was fond of preaching sermons, and so am I, though I never heard it maintained that either of us loved to hear them.&quot;

Lewis Balfour and his daughter both had weak chests, so they often needed to stay in warmer climates for their health. Stevenson inherited a tendency to coughs and fevers, exacerbated when the family moved to a damp, chilly house at 1 Inverleith Terrace in 1851. The family moved again to the sunnier 17 Heriot Row when Stevenson was six years old, but the tendency to extreme sickness in winter remained with him until he was 11. Illness was a recurrent feature of his adult life and left him extraordinarily thin. Contemporaneous views were that he had tuberculosis, but more recent views are that it was bronchiectasis or sarcoidosis. The family also summered in the spa town of Bridge of Allan, in North Berwick, and in Peebles for the sake of Stevenson&#x27;s and his mother&#x27;s health; &quot;Stevenson&#x27;s cave&quot; in Bridge of Allan was reportedly the inspiration for the character Ben Gunn&#x27;s cave dwelling in Stevenson&#x27;s 1883 novel &quot;Treasure Island&quot;.
Stevenson&#x27;s parents were both devout Presbyterians, but the household was not strict in its adherence to Calvinist principles. His nurse Alison Cunningham (known as Cummy) was more fervently religious. Her mix of Calvinism and folk beliefs were an early source of nightmares for the child, and he showed a precocious concern for religion. But she also cared for him tenderly in illness, reading to him from John Bunyan and the Bible as he lay sick in bed and telling tales of the Covenanters. Stevenson recalled this time of sickness in &quot;The Land of Counterpane&quot; in &quot;A Child&#x27;s Garden of Verses&quot; (1885), dedicating the book to his nurse.

Stevenson was an only child, both strange-looking and eccentric, and he found it hard to fit in when he was sent to a nearby school at age 6, a problem repeated at age 11 when he went on to the Edinburgh Academy; but he mixed well in lively games with his cousins in summer holidays at Colinton. His frequent illnesses often kept him away from his first school, so he was taught for long stretches by private tutors. He was a late reader, learning at age 7 or 8, but even before this he dictated stories to his mother and nurse, and he compulsively wrote stories throughout his childhood. His father was proud of this interest; he had also written stories in his spare time until his own father had found them and had told him to &quot;give up such nonsense and mind your business.&quot; He paid for the printing of Robert&#x27;s first publication at 16, entitled &quot;The Pentland Rising: A Page of History, 1666&quot;. It was an account of the Covenanters&#x27; rebellion and was published in 1866, the 200th anniversary of the event.

===Education===

In September 1857, when he was six years old, Stevenson went to &quot;Mr Henderson&#x27;s School&quot; in India Street, Edinburgh, but because of poor health stayed only a few weeks and did not return until October 1859, aged eight. During his many absences, he was taught by private tutors. In October 1861, aged ten, he went to Edinburgh Academy, an independent school for boys, and stayed there sporadically for about fifteen months. In the autumn of 1863, he spent one term at an English boarding school at Spring Grove in Isleworth in Middlesex (now an urban area of West London). In October 1864, following an improvement to his health, the 13-year-old was sent to Robert Thomson&#x27;s private school in Frederick Street, Edinburgh, where he remained until he went to university. In November 1867, Stevenson entered the University of Edinburgh to study engineering. From the start he showed no enthusiasm for his studies and devoted much energy to avoiding lectures. This time was more important for the friendships he made with other students in The Speculative Society (an exclusive debating club), particularly with Charles Baxter, who would become Stevenson&#x27;s financial agent, and with a professor, Fleeming Jenkin, whose house staged amateur drama in which Stevenson took part, and whose biography he would later write. Perhaps most important at this point in his life was a cousin, Robert Alan Mowbray Stevenson (known as &quot;Bob&quot;), a lively and light-hearted young man who, instead of the family profession, had chosen to study art.

===Holidays in Swanston===

In 1867, Stevenson&#x27;s family took a lease on Swanston Cottage, in the village of Swanston at the foot of the Pentland Hills, for use as a summer holiday home. They held the lease until 1880. During their tenancy, the young Robert Louis made frequent use of the cottage, being attracted by the quiet country life and the feeling of remoteness. It is likely that the time he spent there influenced his later writing as well as his wider outlook on life, particularly his love of nature and of wild places. The house and its romantic location are thought to have inspired several of his works.

===Lighthouse inspections===
Each year during his university holidays, Stevenson also travelled to inspect the family&#x27;s engineering works. In 1868, this took him to Anstruther and for a stay of six weeks in Wick, where his family was building a sea wall and had previously built a lighthouse. He was to return to Wick several times over his lifetime and included it in his travel writings. He also accompanied his father on his official tour of Orkney and Shetland islands lighthouses in 1869 and spent three weeks on the island of Erraid in 1870. He enjoyed the travels more for the material they gave for his writing than for any engineering interest. The voyage with his father pleased him because a similar journey of Walter Scott with Robert Stevenson had provided the inspiration for Scott&#x27;s 1822 novel &quot;The Pirate&quot;. In April 1871, Stevenson notified his father of his decision to pursue a life of letters. Though the elder Stevenson was naturally disappointed, the surprise cannot have been great, and Stevenson&#x27;s mother reported that he was &quot;wonderfully resigned&quot; to his son&#x27;s choice. To provide some security, it was agreed that Stevenson should read law (again at Edinburgh University) and be called to the Scottish bar. In his 1887 poetry collection &quot;Underwoods&quot;, Stevenson muses on his having turned from the family profession:

Say not of me that weakly I declined
The labours of my sires, and fled the sea,
The towers we founded and the lamps we lit,
To play at home with paper like a child.
But rather say: &quot;In the afternoon of time&quot;
&quot;A strenuous family dusted from its hands&quot;
&quot;The sand of granite, and beholding far&quot;
&quot;Along the sounding coast its pyramids&quot;
&quot;And tall memorials catch the dying sun,&quot;
&quot;Smiled well content, and to this childish task&quot;
&quot;Around the fire addressed its evening hours.&quot;
===Rejection of church dogma===

In other respects too, Stevenson was moving away from his upbringing. His dress became more Bohemian; he already wore his hair long, but he now took to wearing a velveteen jacket and rarely attended parties in conventional evening dress. Within the limits of a strict allowance, he visited cheap pubs and brothels. More significantly, he had come to reject Christianity and declared himself an atheist. In January 1873, when he was 22, his father came across the constitution of the LJR (Liberty, Justice, Reverence) Club, of which Stevenson and his cousin Bob were members, which began: &quot;Disregard everything our parents have taught us&quot;. Questioning his son about his beliefs, he discovered the truth. Stevenson no longer believed in God and had grown tired of pretending to be something he was not: &quot;am I to live my whole life as one falsehood?&quot; His father professed himself devastated: &quot;You have rendered my whole life a failure.&quot; His mother accounted the revelation &quot;the heaviest affliction&quot; to befall her. &quot;O Lord, what a pleasant thing it is&quot;, Stevenson wrote to his friend Charles Baxter, &quot;to have just damned the happiness of (probably) the only two people who care a damn about you in the world.&quot;

Stevenson&#x27;s rejection of the Presbyterian Church and Christian dogma, however, did not turn into lifelong atheism or agnosticism. On February 15, 1878, the 27-year-old wrote to his father and stated:

Stevenson did not resume attending church in Scotland. However, he did teach Sunday School lessons in Samoa, and prayers he wrote in his final years were published posthumously.

===&quot;An Apology for Idlers&quot;===
Justifying his rejection of an established profession, in 1877 Stevenson offered &quot;An Apology for Idlers&quot;. &quot;A happy man or woman&quot;, he reasoned, &quot;is a better thing to find than a five-pound note. He or she is a radiating focus of goodwill&quot; and a practical demonstration of &quot;the great Theorem of the Liveableness of Life&quot;. So that if they cannot be happy in the &quot;handicap race for sixpenny pieces&quot;, let them take their own &quot;by-road&quot;.

==Early writing and travels==
===Literary and artistic connections===
In late 1873, when he was 23, Stevenson was visiting a cousin in England when he met two people who became very important to him: Fanny (Frances Jane) Sitwell and Sidney Colvin. Sitwell was a 34-year-old woman with a son, who was separated from her husband. She attracted the devotion of many who met her, including Colvin, who married her in 1901. Stevenson was also drawn to her, and they kept up a warm correspondence over several years in which he wavered between the role of a suitor and a son (he addressed her as &quot;Madonna&quot;). Colvin became Stevenson&#x27;s literary adviser and was the first editor of his letters after his death. He placed Stevenson&#x27;s first paid contribution in &quot;The Portfolio&quot;, an essay titled &quot;Roads&quot;.

Stevenson was soon active in London literary life, becoming acquainted with many of the writers of the time, including Andrew Lang, Edmund Gosse and Leslie Stephen, the editor of &quot;The Cornhill Magazine&quot;, who took an interest in Stevenson&#x27;s work. Stephen took Stevenson to visit a patient at the Edinburgh Infirmary named William Ernest Henley, an energetic and talkative poet with a wooden leg. Henley became a close friend and occasional literary collaborator, until a quarrel broke up the friendship in 1888, and he is often considered to be the inspiration for Long John Silver in &quot;Treasure Island&quot;.

Stevenson was sent to Menton on the French Riviera in November 1873 to recuperate after his health failed. He returned in better health in April 1874 and settled down to his studies, but he returned to France several times after that. He made long and frequent trips to the neighbourhood of the Forest of Fontainebleau, staying at Barbizon, Grez-sur-Loing and Nemours and becoming a member of the artists&#x27; colonies there. He also travelled to Paris to visit galleries and the theatres. He qualified for the Scottish bar in July 1875, aged 24, and his father added a brass plate to the Heriot Row house reading &quot;R.L. Stevenson, Advocate&quot;. His law studies did influence his books, but he never practised law; all his energies were spent in travel and writing. One of his journeys was a canoe voyage in Belgium and France with Sir Walter Simpson, a friend from the Speculative Society, a frequent travel companion, and the author of &quot;The Art of Golf&quot; (1887). This trip was the basis of his first travel book &quot;An Inland Voyage&quot; (1878).

Stevenson had a long correspondence with fellow Scot J.M. Barrie. He invited Barrie to visit him in Samoa, but the two never met.

===Marriage===
The canoe voyage with Simpson brought Stevenson to Grez-sur-Loing in September 1876, where he met Fanny Van de Grift Osbourne (1840–1914), born in Indianapolis. She had married at age 17 and moved to Nevada to rejoin husband Samuel after his participation in the American Civil War. Their children were Isobel (or &quot;Belle&quot;), Lloyd and Hervey (who died in 1875). But anger over her husband&#x27;s infidelities led to a number of separations. In 1875, she had taken her children to France where she and Isobel studied art. By the time Stevenson met her, Fanny was herself a magazine short-story writer of recognised ability.

Stevenson returned to Britain shortly after this first meeting, but Fanny apparently remained in his thoughts, and he wrote the essay &quot;On falling in love&quot; for &quot;The Cornhill Magazine&quot;. They met again early in 1877 and became lovers. Stevenson spent much of the following year with her and her children in France. In August 1878, she returned to San Francisco and Stevenson remained in Europe, making the walking trip that formed the basis for &quot;Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes&quot; (1879). But he set off to join her in August 1879, aged 28, against the advice of his friends and without notifying his parents. He took a second-class passage on the steamship &quot;Devonia&quot;, in part to save money but also to learn how others travelled and to increase the adventure of the journey. He then travelled overland by train from New York City to California. He later wrote about the experience in &quot;The Amateur Emigrant&quot;. It was a good experience for his writing, but it broke his health.
He was near death when he arrived in Monterey, California, where some local ranchers nursed him back to health. He stayed for a time at the French Hotel located at 530 Houston Street, now a museum dedicated to his memory called the &quot;Stevenson House&quot;. While there, he often dined &quot;on the cuff,&quot; as he said, at a nearby restaurant run by Frenchman Jules Simoneau, which stood at what is now Simoneau Plaza; several years later, he sent Simoneau an inscribed copy of his novel &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot; (1886), writing that it would be a stranger case still if Robert Louis Stevenson ever forgot Jules Simoneau. While in Monterey, he wrote an evocative article about &quot;the Old Pacific Capital&quot; of Monterey.

By December 1879, aged 29, Stevenson had recovered his health enough to continue to San Francisco where he struggled &quot;all alone on forty-five cents a day, and sometimes less, with quantities of hard work and many heavy thoughts,&quot; in an effort to support himself through his writing. But by the end of the winter, his health was broken again and he found himself at death&#x27;s door. Fanny was now divorced and recovered from her own illness, and she came to his bedside and nursed him to recovery. &quot;After a while,&quot; he wrote, &quot;my spirit got up again in a divine frenzy, and has since kicked and spurred my vile body forward with great emphasis and success.&quot; When his father heard of his 28-year-old son&#x27;s condition, he cabled him money to help him through this period.

Fanny and Robert were married in May 1880. She was 40; he was 29. He said that he was &quot;a mere complication of cough and bones, much fitter for an emblem of mortality than a bridegroom.&quot; He travelled with his new wife and her son Lloyd north of San Francisco to Napa Valley and spent a summer honeymoon at an abandoned mining camp on Mount Saint Helena (today designated Robert Louis Stevenson State Park). He wrote about this experience in &quot;The Silverado Squatters&quot;. He met Charles Warren Stoddard, co-editor of the &quot;Overland Monthly&quot; and author of &quot;South Sea Idylls&quot;, who urged Stevenson to travel to the South Pacific, an idea which returned to him many years later. In August 1880, he sailed with Fanny and Lloyd from New York to Britain and found his parents and his friend Sidney Colvin on the wharf at Liverpool, happy to see him return home. Gradually, his wife was able to patch up differences between father and son and make herself a part of the family through her charm and wit.

===England, and back to the United States===
The Stevensons shuttled back and forth between Scotland and the Continent (twice wintering in Davos) before finally, in 1884, settling in Westbourne in the English south-coast town of Bournemouth. Stevenson had moved there to benefit from its sea air. They lived in a house Stevenson named &#x27;Skerryvore&#x27; after a Scottish lighthouse built by his uncle Alan.

From April 1885, 34-year-old Stevenson had the company of the novelist Henry James. They had met previously in London and had recently exchanged views in journal articles on the &quot;art of fiction&quot; and thereafter in a correspondence in which they expressed their admiration for each other&#x27;s work. After James had moved to Bournemouth to help support his invalid sister, Alice, he took up the invitation to pay daily visits to Skerryvore for conversation at the Stevensons&#x27; dinner table.

Largely bedridden, Stevenson described himself as living &quot;like a weevil in a biscuit.&quot; Yet, despite ill health, during his three years in Westbourne, Stevenson wrote the bulk of his most popular work: &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, &quot;Kidnapped&quot;, &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot; (which established his wider reputation), &quot;A Child&#x27;s Garden of Verses&quot; and &quot;Underwoods&quot;.
Thomas Stevenson died in 1887 leaving his 36-year-old son feeling free to follow the advice of his physician to try a complete change of climate. Stevenson headed for Colorado with his widowed mother and family. But after landing in New York, they decided to spend the winter in the Adirondacks at a cure cottage now known as Stevenson Cottage at Saranac Lake, New York. During the intensely cold winter, Stevenson wrote some of his best essays, including &quot;Pulvis et Umbra&quot;. He also began &quot;The Master of Ballantrae&quot; and lightheartedly planned a cruise to the southern Pacific Ocean for the following summer.
==Reflections on the art of writing==
Stevenson&#x27;s critical essays on literature contain &quot;few sustained analyses of style or content&quot;. In &quot;A Penny Plain and Two-pence Coloured&quot; (1884) he suggests that his own approach owed much to the exaggerated and romantic world that, as a child, he had entered as proud owner of Skelt&#x27;s Juvenile Drama—a toy set of cardboard characters who were actors in melodramatic dramas. &quot;A Gossip on Romance&quot; (1882) and &quot;A Gossip on a Novel of Dumas&#x27;s&quot; (1887) imply that it is better to entertain than to instruct.

Stevenson very much saw himself in the mould of Sir Walter Scott, a storyteller with an ability to transport his readers away from themselves and their circumstances. He took issue with what he saw as the tendency in French realism to dwell on sordidness and ugliness. In &quot;The Lantern-Bearer&quot; (1888) he appears to take Emile Zola to task for failing to seek out nobility in his protagonists.

In &quot;A Humble Remonstrance&quot;, Stevenson answers Henry James&#x27;s claim in &quot;The Art of Fiction&quot; (1884) that the novel competes with life. Stevenson protests that no novel can ever hope to match life&#x27;s complexity; it merely abstracts from life to produce a harmonious pattern of its own.Man&#x27;s one method, whether he reasons or creates, is to half-shut his eyes against the dazzle and confusion of reality...Life is monstrous, infinite, illogical, abrupt and poignant; a work of art, in comparison, is neat, finite, self-contained, rational, flowing, and emasculate...The novel, which is a work of art, exists, not by its resemblances to life, which are forced and material ... but by its immeasurable difference from life, which is designed and significant. It is not clear, however, that in this there was any real basis for disagreement with James. Stevenson had presented James with a copy of &quot;Kidnapped&quot;, but it was &quot;Treasure Island&quot; that James favoured. Written as a story for boys, Stevenson had thought it in &quot;no need of psychology or fine writing&quot;, but its success is credited with liberating children&#x27;s writing from the &quot;chains of Victorian didacticism&quot;.
==Politics: &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;==

During his college years, Stevenson briefly identified himself as a &quot;red-hot socialist&quot;. But already by age 26 he was writing of looking back on this time &quot;with something like regret. ... Now I know that in thus turning Conservative with years, I am going through the normal cycle of change and travelling in the common orbit of men&#x27;s opinions.&quot; His cousin and biographer Sir Graham Balfour claimed that Stevenson &quot;probably throughout life would, if compelled to vote, have always supported the Conservative candidate.&quot; In 1866, then 15-year-old Stevenson did vote for Benjamin Disraeli, the Tory democrat and future Conservative Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, for the Lord Rectorship of the University of Edinburgh. But this was against a markedly illiberal challenger, the historian Thomas Carlyle. Carlyle was notorious for his anti-democratic and pro-slavery views.

In &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;, appearing in &quot;The Contemporary Review&quot; (April 1887), Stevenson suggested: &quot;we are all becoming Socialists without knowing it&quot;. Legislation &quot;grows authoritative, grows philanthropical, bristles with new duties and new penalties, and casts a spawn of inspectors, who now begin, note-book in hand, to darken the face of England&quot;. He is referring to the steady growth in social legislation in Britain since the first of the Conservative-sponsored Factory Acts (which, in 1833, established a professional Factory Inspectorate). Stevenson cautioned that this &quot;new waggon-load of laws&quot; points to a future in which our grandchildren might &quot;taste the pleasures of existence in something far liker an ant-heap that any previous human polity&quot;. Yet in reproducing the essay his latter-day libertarian admirers omit his express understanding for the abandonment of Whiggish, classical-liberal notions of laissez faire. &quot;Liberty&quot;, Stevenson wrote, &quot;has served us a long while&quot; but like all other virtues &quot;she has taken wages&quot;. [Liberty] has dutifully served Mammon; so that many things we were accustomed to admire as the benefits of freedom and common to all, were truly benefits of wealth, and took their value from our neighbour&#x27;s poverty...Freedom to be desirable, involves kindness, wisdom, and all the virtues of the free; but the free man as we have seen him in action has been, as of yore, only the master of many helots; and the slaves are still ill-fed, ill-clad, ill-taught, ill-housed, insolently entreated, and driven to their mines and workshops by the lash of famine.

In January 1888, aged 37, in response to American press coverage of the Land War in Ireland, Stevenson penned a political essay (rejected by &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot; magazine and never published in his lifetime) that advanced a broadly conservative theme: the necessity of &quot;staying internal violence by rigid law&quot;. Notwithstanding his title, &quot;Confessions of a Unionist&quot;, Stevenson defends neither the union with Britain (she had &quot;majestically demonstrated her incapacity to rule Ireland&quot;) nor &quot;landlordism&quot; (scarcely more defensible in Ireland than, as he had witnessed it, in the goldfields of California). Rather he protests the readiness to pass &quot;lightly&quot; over crimes—&quot;unmanly murders and the harshest extremes of boycotting&quot;—where these are deemed &quot;political&quot;. This he argues is to &quot;defeat law&quot; (which is ever a &quot;compromise&quot;) and to invite &quot;anarchy&quot;: it is &quot;the sentimentalist preparing the pathway for the brute&quot;.

==Final years in the Pacific==
===Pacific voyages===


In June 1888, Stevenson chartered the yacht &quot;Casco&quot; from Samuel Merritt and set sail with his family from San Francisco. The vessel &quot;plowed her path of snow across the empty deep, far from all track of commerce, far from any hand of help.&quot; The sea air and thrill of adventure for a time restored his health, and for nearly three years he wandered the eastern and central Pacific, stopping for extended stays at the Hawaiian Islands, where he became a good friend of King Kalākaua. He befriended the king&#x27;s niece Princess Victoria Kaiulani, who also had Scottish heritage. He spent time at the Gilbert Islands, Tahiti, New Zealand and the Samoan Islands. During this period, he completed &quot;The Master of Ballantrae&quot;, composed two ballads based on the legends of the islanders, and wrote &quot;The Bottle Imp&quot;. He preserved the experience of these years in his various letters and in his &quot;In the South Seas&quot; (which was published posthumously). He made a voyage in 1889 with Lloyd on the trading schooner &quot;Equator&quot;, visiting Butaritari, Mariki, Apaiang and Abemama in the Gilbert Islands. They spent several months on Abemama with tyrant-chief Tem Binoka, whom Stevenson described in &quot;In the South Seas&quot;.

Stevenson left Sydney, Australia, on the &quot;Janet Nicoll&quot; in April 1890 for his third and final voyage among the South Seas islands. He intended to produce another book of travel writing to follow his earlier book &quot;In the South Seas&quot;, but it was his wife who eventually published her journal of their third voyage. (Fanny misnames the ship in her account &quot;The Cruise of the Janet Nichol&quot;.) A fellow passenger was Jack Buckland, whose stories of life as an island trader became the inspiration for the character of Tommy Hadden in &quot;The Wrecker&quot; (1892), which Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne wrote together. Buckland visited the Stevensons at Vailima in 1894.

===Political engagement in Samoa===
In December 1889, 39-year-old Stevenson and his extended family arrived at the port of Apia in the Samoan islands and there he and Fanny decided to settle. In January 1890 they purchased at Vailima, some miles inland from Apia the capital, on which they built the islands&#x27; first two-storey house. Fanny&#x27;s sister, Nellie Van de Grift Sanchez, wrote that &quot;it was in Samoa that the word &#x27;home&#x27; first began to have a real meaning for these gypsy wanderers&quot;. In May 1891, they were joined by Stevenson&#x27;s mother, Margaret. While his wife set about managing and working the estate, 40-year-old Stevenson took the native name Tusitala (Samoan for &quot;Teller of Tales&quot;), and began collecting local stories. Often he would exchange these for his own tales. The first work of literature in Samoan was his translation of &quot;The Bottle Imp (1891)&quot;, which presents a Pacific-wide community as the setting for a moral fable.

Immersing himself in the islands&#x27; culture, occasioned a &quot;political awakening&quot;: it placed Stevenson &quot;at an angle&quot; to the rival great powers, Britain, Germany and the United States whose warships were common sights in Samoan harbours. He understood that, as in the Scottish Highlands (comparisons with his homeland &quot;came readily&quot;), an indigenous clan society was unprepared for the arrival of foreigners who played upon its existing rivalries and divisions. As the external pressures upon Samoan society grew, tensions soon descended into several inter-clan wars.

No longer content to be a &quot;romancer&quot;, Stevenson became a reporter and an agitator, firing off letters to &quot;The Times&quot; which &quot;rehearsed with an ironic twist that surely owed something to his Edinburgh legal training&quot;, a tale of European and American misconduct. His concern for the Polynesians is also found in the &quot;South Sea Letters&quot;, published in magazines in 1891 (and then in book form as &quot;In the South Seas&quot; in 1896). In an effort he feared might result in his own deportation, Stevenson helped secure the recall of two European officials. &quot;A Footnote to History: Eight Years of Trouble in Samoa&quot; (1892) was a detailed chronicle of the intersection of rivalries between the great powers and the first Samoan Civil War.

As much as he said he disdained politics—&quot;I used to think meanly of the plumber&quot;, he wrote to his friend Sidney Colvin, &quot;but how he shines beside the politician!&quot;—Stevenson felt himself obliged to take sides. He openly allied himself with chief Mataafa, whose rival Malietoa was backed by the Germans whose firms were beginning to monopolise copra and cocoa bean processing.

Stevenson was alarmed above all by what he perceived as the Samoans&#x27; economic innocence—their failure to secure their claim to proprietorship of the land (in a Lockean sense) through improving management and labour. In 1894 just months before his death, he addressed the island chiefs:There is but one way to defend Samoa. Hear it before it is too late. It is to make roads, and gardens, and care for your trees, and sell their produce wisely, and, in one word, to occupy and use your country... if you do not occupy and use your country, others will. It will not continue to be yours or your children&#x27;s, if you occupy it for nothing. You and your children will, in that case, be cast out into outer darkness&quot;. He had &quot;seen these judgments of God&quot;, not only in Hawaii where abandoned native churches stood like tombstones &quot;over a grave, in the midst of the white men&#x27;s sugar fields&quot;, but also in Ireland and &quot;in the mountains of my own country Scotland&quot;.These were a fine people in the past brave, gay, faithful, and very much like Samoans, except in one particular, that they were much wiser and better at that business of fighting of which you think so much. But the time came to them as it now comes to you, and it did not find them ready...

Five years after Stevenson&#x27;s death, the Samoan Islands were partitioned between Germany and the United States.

==Last works==
Stevenson wrote an estimated 700,000 words during his years on Samoa. He completed &quot;The Beach of Falesá&quot;, the first-person tale of a Scottish copra trader on a South Sea island, a man unheroic in his actions or his own soul. Rather he is a man of limited understanding and imagination, comfortable with his own prejudices: where, he wonders, can he find &quot;whites&quot; for his &quot;half caste&quot; daughters. The villains are white, their behaviour towards the islanders ruthlessly duplicitous.

Stevenson saw &quot;The Beach of Falesá&quot; as the ground-breaking work in his turn away from romance to realism. Stevenson wrote to his friend Sidney Colvin:
&quot;The Ebb-Tide&quot; (1894), the misadventures of three deadbeats marooned in the Tahitian port of Papeete, has been described as presenting &quot;a microcosm of imperialist society, directed by greedy but incompetent whites, the labour supplied by long-suffering natives who fulfil their duties without orders and are true to the missionary faith which the Europeans make no pretence of respecting&quot;. It confirmed the new Realistic turn in Stevenson&#x27;s writing away from romance and adolescent adventure. The first sentence reads: &quot;Throughout the island world of the Pacific, scattered men of many European races and from almost every grade of society carry activity and disseminate disease&quot;. No longer was Stevenson writing about human nature &quot;in terms of a contest between Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;: &quot;the edges of moral responsibility and the margins of moral judgement were too blurred&quot;. As with &quot;The Beach of Falesà&quot;, in &quot;The Ebb Tide&quot; contemporary reviewers find parallels with several of Conrad&#x27;s works: &quot;Almayer&#x27;s Folly&quot;, &quot;An Outcast of the Islands&quot;, &quot;The Nigger of the &#x27;Narcissus&#x27;&quot;&#x27;, &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, and &quot;Lord Jim&quot;.

With his imagination still residing in Scotland and returning to earlier form, Stevenson also wrote &quot;Catriona&quot; (1893), a sequel to his earlier novel &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (1886), continuing the adventures of its hero David Balfour.

Although he felt, as a writer, that &quot;there was never any man had so many irons in the fire&quot;. by the end of 1893 Stevenson feared that he had &quot;overworked&quot; and exhausted his creative vein. His writing was partly driven by the need to meet the expenses of Vailima. But in a last burst of energy he began work on &quot;Weir of Hermiston&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s so good that it frightens me,&quot; he is reported to have exclaimed. He felt that this was the best work he had done. Set in eighteenth century Scotland, it is a story of a society that (however different), like Samoa is witnessing a breakdown of social rules and structures leading to growing moral ambivalence.

==Death==
On 3 December 1894, Stevenson was talking to his wife and straining to open a bottle of wine when he suddenly exclaimed, &quot;What&#x27;s that?&quot;, then asked his wife, &quot;Does my face look strange?&quot;, and collapsed. (Some sources have stated that he was, instead, attempting to make mayonnaise when he collapsed.) He died within a few hours, at the age of 44, possibly as the result of a brain haemorrhage. According to research published in 2000, Stevenson might have suffered from hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Rendu-Weber Syndrome). This would explain his chronic respiratory complaints, recurrent episodes of pulmonary haemorrhage, and his early death. It might also explain his mother&#x27;s hitherto unreported but apparent stroke, at age 38 years.

After his death, the Samoans insisted on surrounding his body with a watch-guard during the night and on bearing him on their shoulders to nearby Mount Vaea, where they buried him on a spot overlooking the sea on land donated by British Acting Vice Consul Thomas Trood. Based on Stevenson&#x27;s poem &quot;Requiem&quot;, the following epitaph is inscribed on his tomb:

Stevenson was loved by the Samoans, and his tombstone epitaph was translated to a Samoan song of grief. The requiem appears on the eastern side of the grave. On the western side the biblical passage of Ruth 1:16–17 is inscribed:

The ensign flag draped over his coffin in Samoa was returned to Edinburgh and now resides in a glass case over the fireplace of rooms in Edinburgh University&#x27;s Old College owned by The Speculative Society, of which he was a member.

==Artistic reception==
Half of Stevenson&#x27;s original manuscripts are lost, including those of &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, &quot;The Black Arrow&quot; and &quot;The Master of Ballantrae&quot;. His heirs sold his papers during World War I, and many Stevenson documents were auctioned off in 1918.

Stevenson was a celebrity in his own time, being admired by many other writers, including Marcel Proust, Arthur Conan Doyle, Henry James, J. M. Barrie, Rudyard Kipling, Emilio Salgari, and later Cesare Pavese, Bertolt Brecht, Ernest Hemingway, Jack London, Vladimir Nabokov, and G. K. Chesterton, who said that Stevenson &quot;seemed to pick the right word up on the point of his pen, like a man playing spillikins.&quot;

Stevenson was seen for much of the 20th century as a second-class writer. He became relegated to children&#x27;s literature and horror genres, condemned by literary figures such as Virginia Woolf (daughter of his early mentor Leslie Stephen) and her husband Leonard Woolf, and he was gradually excluded from the canon of literature taught in schools. His exclusion reached its nadir in the 1973 2,000-page &quot;Oxford Anthology of English Literature&quot; where he was entirely unmentioned, and &quot;The Norton Anthology of English Literature&quot; excluded him from 1968 to 2000 (1st–7th editions), including him only in the eighth edition (2006).
The late 20th century brought a re-evaluation of Stevenson as an artist of great range and insight, a literary theorist, an essayist and social critic, a witness to the colonial history of the Pacific Islands and a humanist. He was praised by Roger Lancelyn Green, one of the Oxford Inklings, as a writer of a consistently high level of &quot;literary skill or sheer imaginative power&quot; and a pioneer of the Age of the Story Tellers along with H. Rider Haggard. He is now evaluated as a peer of authors such as Joseph Conrad (whom Stevenson influenced with his South Seas fiction) and Henry James, with new scholarly studies and organisations devoted to him. Throughout the vicissitudes of his scholarly reception, Stevenson has remained popular worldwide. According to the Index Translationum, Stevenson is ranked the 26th-most-translated author in the world, ahead of Oscar Wilde and Edgar Allan Poe.

On the subject of Stevenson&#x27;s modern reputation, American film critic Roger Ebert wrote in 1996,

==Monuments and commemoration==
===United Kingdom===


The Writers&#x27; Museum near Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal Mile devotes a room to Stevenson, containing some of his personal possessions from childhood through to adulthood.

A bronze relief memorial to Stevenson, designed by the American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens in 1904, is mounted in the Moray Aisle of St Giles&#x27; Cathedral, Edinburgh. Saint-Gaudens&#x27; scaled-down version of this relief is in the collection of the Montclair Art Museum. Another small version depicting Stevenson with a cigarette in his hand rather than the pen he holds in the St. Giles memorial is displayed in the Nichols House Museum in Beacon Hill, Boston.

In the West Princes Street Gardens below Edinburgh Castle a simple upright stone is inscribed: &quot;RLS – A Man of Letters 1850–1894&quot; by sculptor Ian Hamilton Finlay in 1987. In 2013, a statue of Stevenson as a child with his dog was unveiled by the author Ian Rankin outside Colinton Parish Church. The sculptor of the statue was Alan Herriot, and the money to erect it was raised by the Colinton Community Conservation Trust.

Stevenson&#x27;s house Skerryvore, at the head of Alum Chine, was severely damaged by bombs during a destructive and lethal raid in the Bournemouth Blitz. Despite a campaign to save it, the building was demolished. A garden was designed by the Bournemouth Corporation in 1957 as a memorial to Stevenson, on the site of his Westbourne house, &quot;Skerryvore&quot;, which he occupied from 1885 to 1887. A statue of the Skerryvore lighthouse is present on the site. Robert Louis Stevenson Avenue in Westbourne is named after him.

The small hotel in Wick where Stevenson stayed in the summer of 1868 is now called Stevenson House and is marked by a plaque. The house is near the harbour, in the part of Wick known as Pultneytown.

In 1994, to mark the 100th anniversary of Stevenson&#x27;s death, the Royal Bank of Scotland issued a series of commemorative £1 notes which featured a quill pen and Stevenson&#x27;s signature on the obverse, and Stevenson&#x27;s face on the reverse side. Alongside Stevenson&#x27;s portrait are scenes from some of his books and his house in Western Samoa. Two million notes were issued, each with a serial number beginning &quot;RLS&quot;. The first note to be printed was sent to Samoa in time for their centenary celebrations on 3 December 1994.

In 2024, it was announced a Jekyll and Hyde–themed sculpture would be built near where Skerryvore once stood.

===United States===
The Stevenson House at 530 Houston Street in Monterey, California, formerly the French Hotel, memorialises Stevenson&#x27;s 1879 stay in &quot;the Old Pacific Capital&quot;, as he was crossing the United States to join his future wife, Fanny Osbourne. The Stevenson House museum is graced with a bas-relief depicting the sickly author writing in bed.

Spyglass Hill Golf Course, originally called Pebble Beach Pines Golf Club, was renamed &quot;Spyglass Hill&quot; by Samuel F. B. Morse (1885–1969), the founder of Pebble Beach Company, after a place in Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. All the holes at Spyglass Hill are named after characters and places in the novel.

The Robert Louis Stevenson Museum in St. Helena, California, is home to over 11,000 objects and artifacts, the majority of which belonged to Stevenson. Opened in 1969, the museum houses such treasures as his childhood rocking chair, writing desk, toy soldiers and personal writings among many other items. The museum is free to the public and serves as an academic archive for students, writers and Stevenson enthusiasts.

In San Francisco there is an outdoor Robert Louis Stevenson Memorial in Portsmouth Square. In 2024, there was controversy about the San Francisco statue. Jenny Leung, executive director of the Chinese Culture Center, stated &quot;There were a lot of vocal opinions about how ... Robert Louis Stevenson had nothing to do with Chinatown. A lot of those comments.&quot;

At least six US public and private schools are named after Stevenson, in the Upper West Side of New York City, in Fridley, Minnesota, in Burbank, California, in Grandview Heights, Ohio (suburb of Columbus), in San Francisco, California, and in Merritt Island, Florida. There is an R. L. Stevenson middle school in Honolulu, Hawaii and in Saint Helena, California. Stevenson School in Pebble Beach, California, was established in 1952 and still exists as a college preparatory boarding school. Robert Louis Stevenson State Park near Calistoga, California, contains the location where he and Fanny spent their honeymoon in 1880.

A street in Honolulu&#x27;s Waikiki District, where Stevenson lived while in the Hawaiian Islands, was named after his Samoan moniker: Tusitala.

===Samoa===
Stevenson&#x27;s former home in Vailima, Samoa, is now a museum dedicated to the later years of his life. The Robert Louis Stevenson Museum presents the house as it was at the time of his death along with two other buildings added to Stevenson&#x27;s original one, tripling the museum in size. The path to Stevenson&#x27;s grave at the top of Mount Vaea starts at the museum.

===France===
The Chemin de Stevenson (GR 70) is a popular long-distance footpath in France that approximately follows Stevenson&#x27;s route as described in &quot;Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes&quot;. There are numerous monuments and businesses named after him along the route, including a fountain in the town of Saint-Jean-du-Gard where Stevenson sold his donkey Modestine and took a stagecoach to Alès.

<text>Recreational mathematics is mathematics carried out for recreation (entertainment) rather than as a strictly research-and-application-based professional activity or as a part of a student&#x27;s formal education. Although it is not necessarily limited to being an endeavor for amateurs, many topics in this field require no knowledge of advanced mathematics. Recreational mathematics involves mathematical puzzles and games, often appealing to children and untrained adults and inspiring their further study of the subject.

The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) includes recreational mathematics as one of its seventeen Special Interest Groups, commenting:
Mathematical competitions (such as those sponsored by mathematical associations) are also categorized under recreational mathematics.

== Topics ==

Some of the more well-known topics in recreational mathematics are Rubik&#x27;s Cubes, magic squares, fractals, logic puzzles and mathematical chess problems, but this area of mathematics includes the aesthetics and culture of mathematics, peculiar or amusing stories and coincidences about mathematics, and the personal lives of mathematicians.

===Mathematical games===
Mathematical games are multiplayer games whose rules, strategies, and outcomes can be studied and explained using mathematics. The players of the game may not need to use explicit mathematics in order to play mathematical games. For example, Mancala is studied in the mathematical field of combinatorial game theory, but no mathematics is necessary in order to play it.

===Mathematical puzzles===
Mathematical puzzles require mathematics in order to solve them. They have specific rules, as do multiplayer games, but mathematical puzzles do not usually involve competition between two or more players. Instead, in order to solve such a puzzle, the solver must find a solution that satisfies the given conditions.

Logic puzzles and classical ciphers are common examples of mathematical puzzles. Cellular automata and fractals are also considered mathematical puzzles, even though the solver only interacts with them by providing a set of initial conditions.

As they often include or require game-like features or thinking, mathematical puzzles are sometimes also called mathematical games.

=== Mathemagics ===
Magic tricks based on mathematical principles can produce self-working but surprising effects. For instance, a mathemagician might use the combinatorial properties of a deck of playing cards to guess a volunteer&#x27;s selected card, or Hamming codes to identify whether a volunteer is lying.

===Other activities===
Other curiosities and pastimes of non-trivial mathematical interest include:
* patterns in juggling
* the sometimes profound algorithmic and geometrical characteristics of origami
* patterns and process in creating string figures such as Cat&#x27;s cradles, etc.
* fractal-generating software

==Online blogs, podcasts, and YouTube channels==

There are many blogs and audio or video series devoted to recreational mathematics. Among the notable are the following:
* Cut-the-knot by Alexander Bogomolny
* Futility Closet by Greg Ross
* Mathologer by Burkard Polster
* The videos of Vi Hart
* Stand-Up Maths by Matt Parker
* Numberphile by Brady Haran

==Publications==
* The journal &quot;Eureka&quot; published by the mathematical society of the University of Cambridge is one of the oldest publications in recreational mathematics. It has been published 60 times since 1939 and authors have included many famous mathematicians and scientists such as Martin Gardner, John Conway, Roger Penrose, Ian Stewart, Timothy Gowers, Stephen Hawking and Paul Dirac.
* The &quot;Journal of Recreational Mathematics&quot; was the largest publication on this topic from its founding in 1968 until 2014 when it ceased publication.
* &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; (1956 to 1981) was the title of a long-running &quot;Scientific American&quot; column on recreational mathematics by Martin Gardner. He inspired several generations of mathematicians and scientists through his interest in mathematical recreations. &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; was succeeded by 25 &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot; columns (1981-1983), a similarly distinguished, but shorter-running, column by Douglas Hofstadter, then by 78 &quot;Mathematical Recreations&quot; and &quot;Computer Recreations&quot; columns (1984 to 1991) by A. K. Dewdney, then by 96 &quot;Mathematical Recreations&quot; columns (1991 to 2001) by Ian Stewart, and most recently &quot;Puzzling Adventures&quot; by Dennis Shasha.
* The Recreational Mathematics Magazine, published by the Ludus Association, is electronic and semiannual, and focuses on results that provide amusing, witty but nonetheless original and scientifically profound mathematical nuggets. The issues are published in the exact moments of the equinox.

== People ==
Prominent practitioners and advocates of recreational mathematics have included professional and amateur mathematicians:
