<text>The McLaren F1 is a sports car designed and manufactured by British automobile manufacturer McLaren Cars and powered by the BMW S70/2 V12 engine, of which a limited number was produced. The original concept was conceived by Gordon Murray, who successfully convinced Ron Dennis to back the project and hired car designer Peter Stevens to design the exterior and interior of the car. On 31 March 1998, the XP5 prototype with a modified rev limiter set the Guinness World Record for the world&#x27;s fastest production car, reaching , surpassing the Jaguar XJ220&#x27;s record from 1992 achieved with an increased rev limit and catalytic converters removed.

The car features numerous proprietary designs and technologies; it is lighter and has a more streamlined structure than many modern sports cars, despite having one seat more than most similar sports cars, with the driver&#x27;s seat located in the centre (and slightly forward) of two passengers&#x27; seating positions, providing driver visibility superior to that of a conventional seating layout. It was conceived as an exercise in creating what its designers hoped would be considered the ultimate road car. Despite not having been designed for use as a race car, a modified racing version of the vehicle won several races, including the &quot;1995 24 Hours of Le Mans.&quot; Production began in 1992 and ended in 1998. In all, 106 cars were manufactured, with some variations in the design.

In 1994, the British car magazine &quot;Autocar&quot; stated in a road test regarding the F1, &quot;The McLaren F1 is the finest driving machine yet built for the public road.&quot; They further stated, &quot;The F1 will be remembered as one of the great events in the history of the car, and it may possibly be the fastest production road car the world will ever see.&quot; In 2005, Channel 4 placed the car at number one on their list of the 100 greatest cars, calling it &quot;the greatest automotive achievement of all time&quot;. In popular culture, the McLaren F1 has earned its spot as &#x27;The greatest automobile ever created&#x27; and &#x27;The Most Excellent Sports Car of All Time&#x27; amongst a wide variety of car enthusiasts and lovers. Notable past and present McLaren F1 owners include Lewis Hamilton, Elon Musk, Rowan Atkinson, Jay Leno, George Harrison, Ralph Lauren, Nick Mason, and the Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah.
In the April 2017 issue of &quot;Top Gear Magazine&quot;, the McLaren F1 was listed as one of the fastest naturally aspirated cars currently available in the world, and in the same league as more modern vehicles such as the Ferrari Enzo and Aston Martin One-77 despite being produced and engineered 10 years prior to the Ferrari Enzo and 17 years prior to the Aston Martin One-77.

== Design and conception ==

Chief engineer Gordon Murray&#x27;s design concept was a common one among designers of high-performance cars: low weight and high power. This was achieved through the use of high-tech and expensive materials such as carbon fibre, titanium, kevlar, magnesium and gold. The F1 was the first production car to use a carbon-fibre monocoque chassis.

Gordon Murray had been thinking of a three-seat sports car since his youth. When Murray was waiting for a flight home from the Italian Grand Prix in 1988, he drew a sketch of a three-seater sports car and proposed it to Ron Dennis. He pitched the idea of creating &quot;the ultimate road car&quot;, a concept that would be heavily influenced by the company&#x27;s Formula One experience and technology and thus reflect that skill and knowledge through the McLaren F1.

Murray declared that &quot;During this time, we were able to visit Honda&#x27;s Tochigi Research Centre with Ayrton Senna. The visit related to the fact that at the time, Honda powered McLaren&#x27;s F1 Grand Prix chassis. Although it&#x27;s true I had thought it would have been better to put a larger engine, the moment I drove the Honda NSX, all the benchmark cars—Ferrari, Porsche, Lamborghini—I had been using as references in the development of my car vanished from my mind. Of course, the car we would create, the McLaren F1, needed to be faster than the NSX, but the NSX&#x27;s ride quality and handling would become our new design target. Being a fan of Honda engines, I later went to Honda&#x27;s Tochigi Research Centre on two occasions and requested that they consider building for the McLaren F1 a 4.5-litre V10 or V12. I asked, I tried to persuade them, but in the end could not convince them to do it, and the McLaren F1 ended up equipped with a BMW engine.&quot;

A pair of Ultima MK2 kit cars, chassis numbers 12 and 13, &quot;Albert&quot; and &quot;Edward&quot;, the last two MK2s, were used as &quot;mules&quot; to test various components and concepts before the first cars were built. Number 12 was used to test the gearbox with a 454 (7.4l) Chevrolet V8, plus various other components such as the seats and the brakes. Number 13 was the test of the V12, plus the exhaust and cooling system. When McLaren was done with the cars they destroyed both of them to keep away the specialist magazines and because they did not want the car to be associated with &quot;kit cars&quot;.

The car was first unveiled at a launch show, on 28 May 1992, at The Sporting Club in Monaco. The production version remained the same as the original prototype (XP1) except for the wing mirror which, on the XP1, was mounted at the top of the A-pillar. This car was deemed not road legal as it had no indicators at the front; McLaren was forced to make changes to the car as a result (some cars, including Ralph Lauren&#x27;s, were sent back to McLaren and fitted with the prototype mirrors). The original wing mirrors also incorporated a pair of indicators which other car manufacturers would adopt several years later.

The car&#x27;s safety levels were first proved during testing in Namibia in April 1993, when a test driver wearing just shorts and a T-shirt hit a rock and rolled the first prototype car several times, and still managed to escape unscathed. Later in the year, the second prototype (XP2) was specially built for crash testing and passed with the front wheel arch untouched.

=== Engine ===

==== History ====
Gordon Murray insisted that the engine for this car be naturally aspirated to increase reliability and driver control. Turbochargers and superchargers increase power but they increase complexity and can decrease reliability as well as introduce an additional aspect of latency and loss of feedback. The ability of the driver to maintain maximum control of the engine is thus compromised. Murray initially approached Honda for a power plant rated at , with of block length and a total weight of , it was required to be derived from the Formula One power plant in the then-dominating McLaren/Honda cars. When Honda refused, Isuzu, then planning an entry into Formula One, had a 3.5-litre V12 engine being tested in a Lotus chassis. The company was very interested in having the engine fitted into the F1. However, the designers wanted an engine with a proven design and a racing pedigree.

==== Specifications ====
Gordon Murray then approached BMW, which took an interest, and the motorsport division BMW M headed by engine expert Paul Rosche designed and built Murray a 60º V12 engine called the BMW S70/2.
At and the BMW engine ended up 14% more powerful and heavier than Gordon Murray&#x27;s original specifications, with the same block length.

It has an aluminium alloy block and heads, with bore x stroke of DOHC with variable valve timing (a relatively new and unproven technology for the time) for maximum flexibility of control over the 4 valves per cylinder, and a chain drive for the camshafts.

The engine uses a dry sump oil lubrication system. The carbon fibre body panels and monocoque required significant thermal insulation in the engine compartment, so Murray&#x27;s solution was to line the engine bay with a highly efficient heat-reflector: gold foil. Approximately 16 g (0.56 ounce) of gold was used in each car.

The road version of the engine used a compression ratio of 11:1 to produce a maximum power output of at 7,400 rpm and of torque at 5,600 rpm. The engine&#x27;s rev limiter is set at 7,500 rpm. In contrast to raw engine power, a car&#x27;s power-to-weight ratio is a better method of quantifying acceleration performance than the peak output of the vehicle&#x27;s power plant. The standard F1 achieves 550 hp/ton (403 kW/tonne), or just 0.27 hp/lb.

The cam carriers, covers, oil sump, dry sump, and housings for the camshaft control are made of magnesium castings. The intake control features twelve individual butterfly valves, and the exhaust system has four Inconel catalysts with individual Lambda-Sondion controls. The camshafts are continuously variable for increased performance, using a system very closely based on BMW&#x27;s VANOS variable valve timing system for the BMW M3; it is a hydraulically actuated phasing mechanism which retards the inlet cam relative to the exhaust cam at low revs, which reduces the valve overlap and provides for increased idle stability and increased low-speed torque. At higher rpm the valve overlap is increased by computer control to 42 degrees (compare to 25 degrees on the M3) for increased airflow into the cylinders and thus increased performance.

To allow the fuel to atomise fully, the engine uses two Lucas injectors per cylinder, with the first injector located close to the inlet valve – operating at low engine rpm – while the second is located higher up the inlet tract – operating at higher rpm. The dynamic transition between the two devices is controlled by the ECU.
Each cylinder has its own miniature ignition coil. The closed-loop fuel injection is sequential. The engine has no knock sensor as the predicted combustion conditions would not cause this to be a problem. The pistons are forged in aluminium.

Every cylinder bore has a Nikasil coating giving it a high degree of wear resistance.
From 1998 to 2000, the Le Mans–winning BMW V12 LMR sports car used a similar S70/2 engine. The engine was given a short development time, causing the BMW design team to use only trusted technology from prior design and implementation experience. The engine does not use titanium valves or connecting rods. Variable intake geometry was considered but rejected on grounds of unnecessary complication.
As for fuel consumption, the engine achieves on average 15.2 mpg (15 L/100 km), at worst 9.3 mpg (25 L/100 km) and at best 23.4 mpg (10 L/100 km).

It was later revealed that BMW had used an E34 M5 Touring as a test mule in order to test the engine. The existence of such a test mule was revealed when David Clark, the director of McLaren road and race cars from 1994–1998 disclosed this fact to motoring journalist Chris Harris in a podcast. Clark also revealed that the prototype was kept out of the public eye and that BMW is still in possession of the prototype where it has been kept in their top-secret prototype storage facility.

=== Chassis and body ===
The McLaren F1 was an early example of a production road car using a complete carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) monocoque chassis structure. Aluminium and magnesium were used for attachment points for the suspension system, inserted directly into the CFRP.

The car features a central driving position – the driver&#x27;s seat is located in the middle, ahead of the fuel tank and ahead of the engine, with a passenger seat slightly behind and on each side. The vehicle doors move up and out when opened and are thus of the &quot;butterfly&quot; or dihedral type. Gordon Murray&#x27;s design for the doors was inspired by the Toyota Sera.

The engine produces high temperatures under full application and thus causes a high temperature variation in the engine bay from no operation to normal and full operation. CFRP becomes mechanically stressed over time from high heat transfer effects and thus the engine bay was not constructed from CFRP.

=== Aerodynamics ===
The overall drag coefficient on the standard McLaren F1 is , compared with for the faster Bugatti Veyron, and for the SSC Ultimate Aero TT, which was the fastest production car from 2007 to 2010. The vehicle&#x27;s frontal area is and the S·Cd figure is 0.57. Because the McLaren F1 features &quot;active&quot; aerodynamics these are the figures presented in the most streamlined configuration.

The standard McLaren F1 road car features no fixed wing to produce downforce (compare to the LM and GTR editions); however, the overall design of the underbody of the McLaren F1 in addition to a rear diffuser exploits ground effect to improve downforce which is increased through the use of two electric Kevlar fans to further decrease the pressure under the car. A &quot;high downforce mode&quot; can be turned on and off by the driver. At the top of the vehicle, there is an air intake to direct high pressure air to the engine with a low pressure exit point at the top of the very rear. Under each door is a small air intake to provide cooling for the oil tank and some of the electronics. The airflow created by the electric fans not only increases downforce, but the airflow that is created is further exploited through design, by being directed through the engine bay to provide additional cooling for the engine and the ECU. At the front, there are ducts assisted by a Kevlar electric suction fan for cooling the front brakes.

There is a small dynamic rear spoiler on the tail of the vehicle, which will adjust dynamically and automatically attempt to balance the centre of gravity of the car under braking – which will be shifted forward when the brakes are applied. Upon activation of the spoiler, a high pressure zone is created in front of the flap, and this high pressure zone is exploited—two air intakes are revealed upon application that will allow the high pressure airflow to enter ducts that route air to aid in cooling the rear brakes. The spoiler increases the overall drag coefficient from to and is activated at speeds equal to or above by brake line pressure.

=== Suspension ===
Steve Randle, who was the car&#x27;s dynamicist, was appointed responsible for the design of the suspension system of the McLaren F1. It was decided that the ride should be comfortable yet performance-oriented, but not as stiff and low as that of a true &quot;track machine&quot;, as that would imply a reduction in practical use and comfort as well as increasing noise and vibration, which would be a contradictory design choice in relation to the former set premise – the goal of creating the &quot;ultimate road car&quot;.

From inception, the design of the F1 had a strong focus on weight distribution by extensive manipulation of placement of, among other things, the engine, fuel and driver, allowing for a low polar moment of inertia in yaw. The F1 has 42% of its weight at the front and 58% at the rear, this figure changes less than 1% with the fuel load.

The distance between the mass centroid of the car and the suspension roll centre was designed to be the same front and rear to avoid unwanted weight transfer effects. Computer controlled dynamic suspension was considered but not applied due to the inherent increase in weight, complexity and loss of predictability of the vehicle.

Damper and spring specifications: bump, rebound with bounce frequency at 1.41 Hz at the front and 1.75 Hz at the rear. Despite being sports oriented, these figures imply a soft ride and inherently decrease track performance. As can be seen from the McLaren F1 LM and the McLaren F1 GTR track variants, the track performance potential is much higher than that in the standard F1 road car due to the fact that the car should be comfortable and usable in everyday conditions.

The suspension is a double wishbone system with an unusual design. Longitudinal wheel compliance is included without loss of wheel control, which allows the wheel to travel backwards when it hits a bump – increasing the comfort of the ride.

Caster wind-off at the front during braking is handled by McLaren&#x27;s proprietary &quot;Ground Plane Shear Centre&quot; – the wishbones on either side in the subframe are fixed in rigid plane bearings and connected to the body by four independent bushings which are 25 times more stiff radially than axially. This solution provides for a caster wind-off measured to 1.02 degrees per g of braking deceleration. Compare the Honda NSX at 2.91 degrees per g, the Porsche 928 S at 3.60 degrees per g and the Jaguar XJ6 at 4.30 degrees per g respectively. The difference in toe and camber values is also very small under lateral force application. The &quot;Inclined Shear Axis&quot; is used at the rear of the machine and provides measurements of 0.04 degrees per g of change in toe-in under braking and 0.08 degrees per g of toe-out under traction.

When developing the suspension system, the facility of electro-hydraulic kinematics and compliance at AB Dynamics was employed to measure the performance of the suspension on a Jaguar XJR16, a Porsche 928 S and a Honda NSX to use as references.

Steering knuckles and the top wishbone/bell crank are also specially manufactured in an aluminium alloy. The wishbones are machined from a solid aluminium alloy with CNC machines.

=== Tyres ===
The McLaren F1 uses 235/45ZR17 front tyres and 315/45ZR17 rear tyres. These are specially designed and developed solely for the McLaren F1 by Goodyear, Michelin, Avon and Pirelli. The tyres are mounted on front, and rear five-spoke cast magnesium wheels, coated with a protective paint and secured by magnesium retention pins.

The turning circle from kerb to kerb is , allowing the driver 2.8 turns from lock to lock.

=== Brakes ===
The F1 features unassisted, vented and cross-drilled brake discs made by Brembo. The Front size is and the rear . The calipers are all four-pot, opposed piston types, and are made of aluminium. The rear brake calipers do not feature any handbrake functionality, however there is a mechanically actuated, fist-type calipers which is computer controlled and thus serve as a handbrake.

To increase caliper stiffness, the calipers are machined from a single solid piece of metal (in contrast to the more common being bolted together from two halves). Pedal travel is slightly over one inch. Activation of the rear spoiler will allow the air pressure generated at the back of the vehicle to force air into the cooling ducts located at either end of the spoiler which become uncovered upon application of it.

Servo-assisted ABS brakes were ruled out as they would imply increased mass, complexity and reduced brake feel; however, at the cost of increasing the required skill of the driver.

Gordon Murray attempted to utilise carbon brakes for the F1, but found the technology to be not advanced enough at the time; with one of the major culprits being that of a proportional relationship between brake disc temperature and friction—i.e. stopping power—thus resulting in relatively poor brake performance without an initial warm-up of the brakes before use.
Since carbon brakes have a more simplified application envelope in pure racing environments, this allows for the racing edition of the car, the &quot;F1 GTR&quot;, to feature ceramic carbon brakes.

=== Gearbox and powertrain ===
The standard McLaren F1 has a transverse 6-speed manual gearbox with an AP carbon triple-plate clutch contained in an aluminium housing. The gearbox was developed in collaboration with Weismann transmissions in California. The second generation GTR edition has a magnesium housing. Both the standard edition and the &#x27;McLaren F1 LM&#x27; have the following gear ratios: 3.23:1, 2.19:1, 1.71:1, 1.39:1, 1.16:1, 0.93:1, with a final drive of 2.37:1, although the final gear is offset from the side of the clutch. The Torsen Limited Slip Differential has a 40% lock. The sixth gear ratio allows for a longer cruise at per 1000 rpm.

The McLaren F1 has an aluminium flywheel that has only the dimensions and mass absolutely needed to allow the torque from the engine to be transmitted. This is done in order to decrease rotational inertia and increase the responsiveness of the drivetrain, resulting in faster gear changes and better throttle feedback. This is possible due to the F1 engine lacking secondary vibrational couples and featuring a torsional vibration damper by BMW.

=== Interior and equipment ===

Standard equipment for the McLaren F1 includes full cabin air conditioning, a rarity on most sports cars and a system design which Murray again credited to the Honda NSX, a car he had owned and driven himself for 7 years without ever needing to change the AC automatic setting. Further comfort features included SeKurit electric defrost/demist windscreen and side glass, electric window lifts, remote central locking, Kenwood 10-disc CD stereo system, cabin access release for opening panels, cabin storage compartment, four-lamp high performance headlight system, rear fog and reversing lights, courtesy lights in all compartments, map reading lights and a gold-plated Facom titanium tool kit and first aid kit (both stored in the car). In addition, tailored, proprietary luggage bags specially designed to fit the vehicle&#x27;s carpeted storage compartments, including a tailored golf bag, were standard equipment. Airbags are not present in the car. Each customer was given a special edition TAG Heuer 6000 Chronometer wristwatch with its serial number scripted below the centre stem.

All features of the F1 were, according to Gordon Murray, obsessed over, including the interior. The metal plates fitted to improve the aesthetics of the cockpit are claimed to be 20 thousandths of an inch (0.5 mm) thick to save weight.
The driver&#x27;s seat of the McLaren F1 is custom fitted to the specifications desired by the customer for optimal fit and comfort; the seats are handmade from CFRP and covered in light Connolly leather. By design, the F1 steering column cannot be adjusted; however, prior to production each customer specifies the exact preferred position of the steering wheel and thus the steering column is tailored by default to those owner settings. The same holds true for the pedals, which are not adjustable after the car has left the factory but are tailored to each specific customer.

During its pre-production stage, McLaren commissioned Kenwood, the team&#x27;s supplier of radio equipment, to create a lightweight car audio system for the car; Kenwood, between 1992 and 1998 used the F1 to promote its products in print advertisements, calendars and brochure covers. Each car&#x27;s audio system was specially designed to tailor to an individual&#x27;s listening taste; however, radio was omitted because Murray felt it wasn&#x27;t necessary.

=== Purchase and maintenance ===
Only 106 cars were manufactured: 5 prototypes (XP1, XP2, XP3, XP4, XP5), 64 road versions (F1), 1 tuned developmental prototype (XP1 LM), 5 tuned versions (LM), 1 longtail developmental prototype (XPGT), 2 longtail versions (GT), and 28 racecars (GTR). Production began in 1992 and ended in 1998. At the time of production, each car took around three and a half months to make.

Although production stopped in 1998, McLaren still maintains an extensive support and service network for the F1. Every standard F1 has a modem which allows customer care to remotely fetch information from the ECU of the car in order to assist the customer in the event of a mechanical vehicle failure. There are eight authorised service centres throughout the world, and McLaren will on occasion fly a specialised technician to the owner of the car or the service centre. All of the technicians have undergone dedicated training in service of the McLaren F1. In cases where major structural damage has occurred, the car can be returned to McLaren directly for repair.

=== Performance ===
The F1 remains one of the fastest production cars ever made; as of October 2018, it is outmatched by very few cars, including the Bugatti Veyron and the Bugatti Chiron.

However, all of the higher top speed machines use forced induction to reach their respective top speeds, whereas the McLaren F1 is naturally aspirated. To date the F1 holds the record for fastest naturally aspirated production car, a record it has held for almost 30 years.

== Record claims ==

In August 1993, McLaren tested the XP3 prototype – which was limited to – at the Nardò Ring. They calculated a top speed of from the data recording inside the car.

The British magazine &quot;Autocar&quot; was given access and tested the XP5 prototype in May 1994. They wrote: &quot;Had we enough tarmac, we have no doubt that it would finally stop accelerating at its rev-limiter in top which, taking tyre growth into account, would be somewhere the far side of .&quot;

&quot;Car and Driver&quot; wrote in their August 1994 issue (&quot;Courtesy of Autocar &amp; Motor&quot; written in the box with performance numbers):
&quot;Top speed? The F1 runs into the 7,500 rpm redline in sixth at but it&#x27;s still accelerating. Gordon Murray, the F1&#x27;s designer, is convinced that with taller gearing, the car is capable of at least .&quot;

On 31 March 1998, Andy Wallace drove the five-year-old XP5 prototype at Volkswagen&#x27;s test track in Ehra-Lessien, setting a new production car world record. The record consisted of an independently measured two-way average with the peak speed of measured by McLaren with the rev-limiter raised to 8,300 rpm.

As of 2022, the F1 remains the fastest naturally aspirated production car in the world, a record that has been held for 24 years. Although its speed record has been passed, the cars that have surpassed it use forced induction engines.

== Motorsports ==

Following its initial launch as a road car, motorsports teams convinced McLaren to build racing versions of the F1 to compete in international series. Three different versions of the race car were developed from 1995 to 1997.

Some of the F1 GTRs, after the cars were no longer eligible for international racing series, were converted to street use. By adding mufflers, and passenger seats, adjusting the suspension for more ground clearance for public streets, and removing the air-restrictors, the cars were able to be registered for road use.

=== F1 GTR 1995 ===
Built at the request of race teams, such as those owned by Ray Bellm and Thomas Bscher, in order to compete in the BPR Global GT Series, the McLaren F1 GTR was a custom-built race car which introduced a modified engine management system that increased power output – however, air-restrictors mandated by racing regulations reduced the power back to at 7,500 rpm. The car&#x27;s list of modifications included changes to body panels, suspension, aerodynamics and the interior. The F1 GTR would go on to take its greatest achievement with first, third, fourth, fifth, and 13th places in the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans, beating out custom built prototype sports cars. When Mark Blundell – who finished fourth in the race – was asked what the F1 GTR was like to drive during the wet race, he said: &quot;Well it was never designed to be a race car so in many respects it wasn&#x27;t the best-balanced car in the world. The saving grace of the car was the BMW V12 engine. It was incredibly impressive in that you could be in 6th gear at 2,000 rpm and the thing would just pull like a train. And in the wet that is great as you can run a higher gear and it cuts out some of that traction issue. But in terms of balance, overall it was always a bit top heavy, so the centre of gravity wasn’t ideal. And aerodynamically it wasn&#x27;t quite there, but it did the job&quot;.

In total, nine F1 GTRs were built for the 1995 season.

The 1995 F1 GTR created so much downforce that it was claimed to be able to drive upside down along a ceiling at .

=== F1 GTR 1996 ===
To follow up on the success of the F1 GTR in 1996, McLaren further developed the 1995 model, leading to a size increase but a weight decrease. Nine more F1 GTRs were built to 1996 spec, while some 1995 cars were still campaigned by privateers. F1 GTR 1996 chassis #14R is notable as being the first non-Japanese car to win a race in the All-Japan Grand Touring Car Championship (JGTC). The car was driven by David Brabham and John Nielsen. The weight was reduced to around from the 1995 GTR but the engine was kept de-tuned at to comply with racing regulations.

=== F1 GTR 1997 ===
With three F1 GT homologation street versions produced, McLaren could now develop the F1 GTR for the 1997 season. Weight was further reduced and a sequential gearbox was added. The engine was slightly destroked to 6.0 L instead of the previous 6.1 L. Due to the heavily modified bodywork, the F1 GTR 1997 is often referred to as the &quot;Longtail&quot; thanks to the rear bodywork being extended to increase downforce. A total of ten F1 GTRs were built for the 1997 season. The weight was reduced to a total of .

== Variants ==

The McLaren F1 road car, of which 64 were originally sold, saw several different modifications over its production span which were badged as different models. The company maintains a database to match up prospective sellers and buyers of the cars.

=== Prototypes ===
Prior to the sale of the first McLaren F1s, five prototypes were built, carrying the numbers XP1 through XP5. These cars carried minor subtle differences between each other as well as between the production road cars. Contrary to common misunderstanding, XP1, the first ever running prototype, was never publicly unveiled. The XP1 was never painted (with a bare carbon fibre exterior) and was later destroyed in an accident in Namibia. The car unveiled at the Monaco 1992 event was actually a &quot;Clinic Model&quot;, aesthetically convincing but without a powertrain. XP2 was used for crash testing (sporting a blue colour during the test) and also destroyed. As it was a crash test car, it didn&#x27;t have full interior equipment or a powertrain. XP3 did durability testing, XP4 stress tested the gearbox system and XP5 was a publicity car. The XP3 used to be owned by Gordon Murray before being sold to a private buyer. XP4 was seen by viewers of &quot;Top Gear&quot; when reviewed by Tiff Needell in the mid-1990s and later on sold to a private owner, while XP5 went on to be used in McLaren&#x27;s famous top speed run and is still owned by McLaren.

===Ameritech===
Seven McLaren F1s were imported by Ameritech and modified in order to be federalized for road use in the United States. These modifications include the deletion of side seats, the replacement of headlights, a heightened bumper and dampened performance figures including handling and braking compared to the European F1, due to road legality issues. It weighs in at .

====Performance====
Performance figures are lower than a regular F1 in all aspects (apart from ) relating to performance. As Mario Andretti noted in a top speed comparison test after hitting the rev limiter at on Ameritech F1, the Ameritech F1 is fully capable of pulling a seventh gear, thus with a higher gear ratio or a seventh gear the car would probably be able to reach an even greater top speed.

=== F1 LM ===

The McLaren F1 LM (LM for Le Mans) is a series of five special cars which were built in honour of the five McLaren F1 GTRs which finished the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans, including the winning car.

The weight was reduced by approximately to a total of – achieved by having no interior noise suppression, no audio system, a stripped-down base interior, no fan-assisted ground effect and no dynamic rear wing. The car also had a different transaxle, various aerodynamic modifications, specially designed magnesium alloy wheels and an upgraded gearbox. The F1 LM used the same engine as the 1995 F1 GTR, but without race-mandated restrictors, to produce . It had a top speed of , which is less than the standard version because of added aerodynamic drag, despite identical gear ratios. In the place of the small dynamic rear wing there is a considerably larger, fixed CFRP rear wing mounted on the back of the vehicle.

The LM has the following specifications: 
* Peak torque of at 4,500 rpm
* Peak power of at 7,800 rpm
* A redline at 8,500 rpm 
* Total weight of which gives the car an per litre ratio.
While McLaren has never claimed specific acceleration figures for the LM, &quot;Motor Trend&quot; recorded traction-limited times of 0–60 mph in 3.9 seconds and 0–100 mph in 6.7 seconds. The LM was once the holder of the 0–100–0 mph record, which it completed in 11.5 seconds when driven by Andy Wallace at the disused airbase RAF Alconbury in Cambridgeshire.

The F1 LMs can be identified by their Papaya Orange paint. They were painted in this colour in memory of, and tribute to, Bruce McLaren, whose race colour was Papaya Orange. Two of the chassis were painted in Black with Grey trim similar to the Ueno Clinic sponsored Le Mans 24 Hours winning car. These cars were bought by the Sultan of Brunei and, as such, also feature horizontal stripes down the sides in yellow, red and blue.

Although only five F1 LMs were sold, a sixth chassis exists in the form of XP1 LM, the prototype for modifications to the existing F1 to form the new F1 LM. This car is also painted Papaya Orange and is retained by McLaren.

=== F1 High Downforce Kit (HDK) ===
Two standard F1s were upgraded to &quot;LM specification&quot;. These have chassis numbers 073 and 018. The engines were upgraded to unrestricted GTR specification resulting in a power output of and had the High Downforce Kit (HDK) added to them. Their interiors were made more comfortable over the F1 LM. The car having chassis number 018 had upgrades to the air conditioning units, the headlamps changed to a gas discharge type and the steering wheel changed to a 14-inch unit. Moreover, race specification dampers and springs set to the softest settings for comfortable road use were added. 18-inch GTR wheels were used instead of the standard 17-inch and the tyres used are Michelin Pilot Sport units.

=== F1 GT ===

The final and rarest incarnation of the road car, the F1 GT was meant as a homologation special. With increased competition from homologated sports cars from Porsche and Mercedes-Benz in the former BPR Global GT Series and the new FIA GT Championship, McLaren required extensive modification to the F1 GTR in order to remain competitive. These modifications were so vast that McLaren would be required to build a production road-legal car on which the new race cars would be based.

The F1 GT featured the same extended rear bodywork as the GTRs for increased downforce and reduced drag yet lacked the rear wing that had been seen on the F1 LM. The downforce generated by the longer tail was found to be sufficient to not require the wing. The front end was also similar to the racing car, with extra louvers and the wheel arches widened to fit larger wheels. The interior was modified, and a racing steering wheel was included in place of the standard unit.

The F1 GTs were built from standard F1 road car chassis, retaining their production numbers. The developmental prototype GT, known as XPGT, was F1 chassis #056XP, was painted dark green (&quot;Silverstone green&quot;) and is owned by a private collector in Switzerland. The company technically only needed to build one car and did not even have to sell it. However, demand from customers drove McLaren to build two production versions that were sold; the customer F1 GTs were chassis #054 and #058. #054 was painted black and is owned by the Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah, while #058 was painted burgundy and is owned by the ZAZ Museum in Japan. It weighs , lighter than the standard F1 and has a top speed of over , although this was never tested.

<text>Parmjit Singh Dhanda (born 17 September 1971) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Gloucester from 2001 until the 2010 general election, succeeding Tess Kingham as the Labour MP for the seat.

==Background==
Parmjit Singh Dhanda was born on 17 September 1971 in Hillingdon, West London to immigrant Indian Punjabi Sikh parents, and was brought up in Southall. His mother was a cleaner at a local hospital, whilst his father was a lorry driver. He was educated at Mellow Lane School, a state Comprehensive School in Hayes, Middlesex, before attending the University of Nottingham, where he received a Bachelor of Engineering degree in 1993, and an MA in information technology in 1995.

Dhanda is a British-Indian, the first Sikh Government Minister, a British-Punjabi and a British-Sikh.

Dhanda is married with two children. He has been a member of the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (USDAW) since 1999. He speaks Punjabi and French, in addition to English.

==Political career==
Dhanda became a Labour Party organiser in West London, Hampshire and Wiltshire in 1996, then went on to be an assistant national organiser with Connect in 1998 where he remained until he was elected to Westminster. He was elected as a councillor in the London Borough of Hillingdon in 1998 and served on the council until 2002. As a member of Labour&#x27;s list for the 1999 European Parliament election, he became the country&#x27;s youngest European Parliamentary candidate, aged 27.

He was selected to contest the House of Commons constituency of Gloucester at the 2001 general election - the seat Labour required for a parliamentary majority of 1 - following the decision of Tess Kingham to stand down. He made his maiden speech in the Commons on 27 June 2001, in which he made reference to the local newspaper&#x27;s article stating (upon his selection by the Labour Party) that &quot;the people of Gloucester had not reached a sufficiently advanced state of consciousness to accept a &#x27;foreigner&#x27; as the local MP&quot;. In parliament, Dhanda became a member of the Science and Technology Select committee from his election until 2003. He helped set up an all-party group on Telecommunications, of which he was Secretary. In December 2004, he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister for Schools Stephen Twigg.

In November 2003, Dhanda was asked by the Prime Minister Tony Blair to second the Loyal Address to the Monarch from the Houses of Commons.

Dhanda retained his seat in 2005 with an increased majority of 4,280 votes. After the election, Dhanda was appointed to the post of Assistant Government Whip. In May 2006, he was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Young People and Families in the Department for Education and Skills. In this post, he implemented the Green Paper &#x27;Care Matters&#x27;, introducing radical new measures of support for 30,000 children in the care system. On 28 June 2007, he became Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government with responsibility for the fire and rescue service, community cohesion and planning. He was replaced by Sadiq Khan on 6 Oct 2008.

In 2009, he fought a campaign to be Speaker of the House of Commons, obtaining 4.4% of the votes in the first ballot.

At the speaker&#x27;s conference in October 2009, Dhanda criticised the way that all 23 of Gordon Brown&#x27;s cabinet were White, whereas Tony Blair&#x27;s last cabinet had two &quot;ethnic minority&quot; cabinet ministers. Brown pointed out that he had a Black Attorney General (Baroness Scotland) and an Asian Minister of State for Transport (Sadiq Khan) who sat around the Cabinet table (though only when their ministerial responsibilities are on the agenda).
At the 2010 general election, Dhanda lost his seat to Richard Graham of the Conservative Party.
&quot;The Telegraph (Calcutta)&quot; reported that in December 2010, Dhanda decided to retire from politics, moving from Gloucester to London. He did not seek election at the 2015 general election.

==Post-parliamentary career==
After the 2010 general election, he became a non-executive director of Hanover Housing Association - an association specialising in housing and support for the elderly and as Parliamentary and Campaigns Officer for the Prospect Trade Union.

In 2014, he commissioned research which was published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; about the lack of representation of BME communities in the Houses of Parliament. In 2015, Dhanda published his political memoirs, &quot;My Political Race, An Outsider&#x27;s Journey to the Heart of British Politics&quot;.

Since 2010, Dhanda has run for selection in multiple Labour safe and target seats, including Brent Central (UK Parliament constituency) in 2013, Aberavon in 2014, Ealing North in 2019 and Wycombe in 2022.

Dhanda became Executive Director at Back Heathrow from June 2017, a campaign seeking to highlight the benefits of the Heathrow Airport Expansion.

In 2017 Dhanda became the first non-executive Chair of the Allied Health Professionals Federation, the country&#x27;s third largest staff representative organisation in the NHS.

He served as a non-executive director of the Milton Keynes University Foundation Trust Hospital, where he chaired the Trust charity, helping to raise £10 million to build its cancer centre.

He is also a non-executive director of the Longhurst Group, a housing association that builds social housing and provides social care on a not-for-profit basis.

<doc id="420186" wikidata="Q338076" url="?curid=420186" title="Andrew Dismore">
<text>Andrew Hartley Dismore (born 2 September 1954) is a British Labour politician who was the Member of the London Assembly for Barnet and Camden from 2012 to 2021. He previously was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Hendon from 1997 until 2010.

==Early life==
Dismore was born in Bridlington, East Riding of Yorkshire, the son of a hotelier. He was educated at Bridlington Grammar School before attending the University of Warwick, where he received a LLB in 1975, and the London School of Economics, where he was awarded his LLM in 1976. He graduated from The College of Law in 1978.

==Professional life==
Dismore joined the Labour Party in 1974. After a brief time during his studies when he worked as an education officer with the General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trade Union, he began his professional career as a partner with Robin Thompson and Partners Solicitors in 1978. He became a partner in the firm Russell Jones &amp; Walker Solicitors in 1995.

He was elected as a councillor for Westbourne on Westminster City Council in 1982, becoming the Labour group leader in 1990. During his time there, he led the criticism of Shirley Porter and the homes for votes scandal.

==Member of Parliament==
He was elected to the House of Commons at the 1997 general election for the new seat of Hendon, defeating John Gorst, the sitting Conservative MP for the former constituency of Hendon North, by 6,155 votes. He made his maiden speech on 6 June 1997, in which he criticised the government of John Major for closing the Edgware General Hospital A &amp; E department. He became a member of the Social Security select committee in 1998, and after the 2001 general election its replacement, the Work and Pensions Select Committee, on which he remained until 2005. He was a member of the Standards and Privileges Select Committee from 2001 until 2010 and the Human Rights and Liaison committees from 2005 to 2010 (chairing the Joint Committee on Human Rights).

Dismore asked Tony Blair a parliamentary question about Holocaust memorial and education, and received a written answer on 10 June 1999. This led to the establishment of Holocaust Memorial Day in the UK. He set the 21st century record for a filibuster in the House of Commons by talking for 197 minutes during the debate of the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Protection of Property) Bill.

In the 2010 general election Dismore lost his seat by 106 (0.2%) votes to Conservative candidate and former Hendon ward councillor Matthew Offord. In his losing speech Dismore complained that Offord had used his record of expenses against him.

He was a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Tribal Peoples.

In 2015, Dismore stood once again as the Labour Party candidate for Hendon in the General Election but failed to regain his seat, instead losing by a bigger majority as the Conservatives improved their position overall.

In 2009, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that he had claimed expenses equivalent to 487 journeys between Parliament and his constituency home, although the Commons only sat for 145 days.

It was reported by the BBC in March 2010, that Dismore had annual trips to Cyprus, funded by the Cypriot Parliament. Dismore failed to declare this interest on a number of Parliamentary Questions and Early Day Motions, despite providing this information on the register of members’ interests.

==London Assembly==
Following his defeat as MP for Hendon, Andrew Dismore was selected as the Labour Party candidate for the Barnet and Camden constituency in the 2012 London Assembly election, defeating Conservative incumbent Brian Coleman. He was re-elected in 2016 with a reduced majority. Dismore served as Chair of the London Assembly&#x27;s Fire, Resilience and Emergency Planning Committee. During his time on the Assembly, he has campaigned on issues including tube noise and the impact of Brexit on London. He stood down in 2021 and was succeeded by Anne Clarke.

<text>San Férnando, officially the City of San Fernando (; ), is a component city and the capital of the province of La Union, Philippines. It is a coastal city consisting of 59 barangays and covers an area of 105.26 square kilometers. According to the 2020 census, the city has a population of 125,642. San Fernando serves as the gateway to trade and commerce to the North and the culture and heritage of Ilocandia.

The city is the regional and administrative capital of the Ilocos Region, hosting several regional and field offices of national government agencies, regional branches of government financial institutions, and various government-owned and controlled corporations. The city is home to some of the region&#x27;s premier educational and medical institutions, including the Ilocos Training and Regional Medical Center, recognized as the core of public health and medical care in the Ilocos Region.

It is one of the two capital cities named &quot;San Fernando&quot;, the other being San Fernando in Pampanga.

== Etymology ==
The city, formerly known as Pindangan, was renamed on May 6, 1786, by Fr. Fernando Rey, in honor of Ferdinand III of Castile, also known as &quot;Saint Ferdinand III of León&quot; (San Fernando III de León), a 13th-century king who reigned as King of Castile from 1217, King of León from 1230, and King of Galicia from 1231; he is celebrated for his successful Christian conquest of Seville during the Reconquista and was canonized for his piety, military leadership, and promotion of Christian unity.

==History==
=== Early History ===
The early history of the city can be traced back to its initial settlements by the Samtoy (Ilocano) people and a small community of Pangasinan traders who inhabited the coastal shores and riverbanks. In the highland areas, the early inhabitants included the Cordillerans (Igorot), particularly the Kankanaey people. These early communities were animist-pagan believers and were renowned for their farming, hunting and seafaring skills.

According to historian William Henry Scott, the coastal area of the Ilocos region, including the city, served as a significant hub for gold trading with the Cordilleran (Igorot) people from the highlands. The settlers also engaged in trade with neighboring communities, such as the Pangasinan, Sambal and Tagalog peoples, as well as with foreign traders from Maritime Southeast Asia, China (particularly from Fujian during the Ming Dynasty), and Japan. Japanese traders later established a trading port in Aroo (modern-day Agoo), a northern section of Caboloan a pre-colonial polity in Pangasinan.

Commonly traded goods included gold, jewelry, earthen jars (&quot;burnay&quot;), silk, rice, cotton, beeswax, honey, wine (&quot;basi&quot;), metals, and ceramics or porcelain.

=== Spanish Regime ===
In June 1572, Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo arrived in the area now known as San Fernando, following his successful pacification of native and Japanese settlers in &quot;Aroo&quot; or &quot;Agoho&quot; (present-day Agoo). Miguel de Loarca in 1582 describe the settlement as &quot;el puerto de Japon&quot; due to its significance as a Japanese trading post.

Upon reaching San Fernando, he encountered the indigenous inhabitants and demanded tribute on behalf of the Spanish Crown. The locals requested time to gather the tribute from the mountains but never to returned. Salcedo then continued his journey, sailing and exploring northward until he established Vigan as the administrative center of Spanish governance and influence in Northern Luzon. This development marked the beginning of efforts to convert the local population to Christianity.

By 1759, the early settlements of San Fernando consisted of two barrios established by Augustinians friars: &quot;San Guillermo de Dalangdang&quot;, situated at the foothills of the Cordillera mountains, and &quot;San Vicente de Balanac&quot;, a coastal village. San Guillermo often became a target of headhunting by the Igorots during the blooming of flowering trees, as such acts were believed to appease their deities. 
Meanwhile, during the calm summer months, San Vicente de Balanac suffered raids by &quot;Tirongs&quot; and &quot;Moro&quot; pirates, who abducted women and children and left widespread destruction. In response to these relentless attacks, Father Jose Torres, an Augustinian friar, encouraged the remaining populations of San Guillermo de Dalangdang and San Vicente de Balanac to unite for their mutual protection. 

In 1762, they established a new settlement called &quot;Pindangan&quot;, named after the Iloco term &quot;pindang&quot;, meaning &quot;to dry fish or meat.&quot; The name &quot;Pindangan&quot; reflected the area&#x27;s role as a site for fish-drying activities. A large church was constructed in the settlement, serving as its central landmark. However, the church was later destroyed by a devastating earthquake.

In 1764, Don Santiago Olarte was appointed as the first &quot;gobernadorcillo&quot; of Pindangan, a position equivalent to that of a modern-day mayor. Following the destruction of the original church by an earthquake, the Franciscans decided not to rebuild it in its original location. Instead, during the rainy season, they relocated the church to a more suitable site. This structure eventually became known as the Cathedral of St. William the Hermit, now part of the Diocese of San Fernando, La Union.

By 1785, During the administration of Governor-General José Basco in 1785, San Fernando along with its neighboring &quot;pueblos&quot;, was placed under the northern territorial jurisdiction of Pangasinan province as part of broader efforts to improve governance and economic productivity during the Spanish colonial period.

On May 6, 1786, Pindangan was officially renamed and established as the &quot;Ministerio de San Fernando&quot; by Fr. Fernando Rey, in honor of King Ferdinand of Spain. However, between 1792 and 1831, a shortage of priests led to San Fernando becoming a &quot;visita&quot; (mission station) of the nearby towns of Bauang and San Juan. It was only in 1831 that Fr. Juan Sorolla, who had served as the parish priest of Bauang since 1829, was assigned to San Fernando, further cementing its religious and administrative significance.

San Fernando society during this period was divided into two classes: the &quot;babaknang&quot; and the &quot;cailianes&quot;. The &quot;babaknang&quot; or &quot;baknang&quot; referred to the wealthy and the local elite, often landowners and educated individuals, many of whom were part of the &quot;principalia&quot; or &quot;insulares&quot; who spoke Castilian. The &quot;cailianes&quot;, on the other hand, were the &quot;idios&quot; or the common folk, often landless or with limited resources, speaking Iloco, Kankanai, and Ibaloi. The &quot;Mestizos de Sangley&quot; or &quot;Chinos&quot;, tracing their ancestry to Chinese settlers, were also prevalent in the town. Ilocano served as the town’s lingua franca.

By 1850, San Fernando had a population of 4,805, including a single &quot;ranchería&quot; called San Ramon, located in the mountainous areas of the town with 798 population. Don Bagulin served as the &quot;gobernadorcillo&quot; of San Ramon, which was primarily inhabited by the &quot;Vagos&quot; or &quot;Bago&quot; people—Christianized Igorots or &quot;Nuevo Cristianos&quot; of Kankanaey and Ibaloi descent.

==== San Fernando as the Cabecera ====
On October 29, 1849, Governor-General Narciso Zaldua Clavería issued a &quot;promovido&quot; that unified eight northern towns of Pangasinan including San Fernando, three southern towns of Ilocos Sur located south of the Amburayan River, and 40-45 rancherias of the Eastern &quot;País del Igorotes&quot; in the Cordilleras to form the province of La Union. Subsequently, on March 2, 1850, Governor-General Antonio María Blanco signed the &quot;Superior Decreto&quot;, officially establishing La Union and designating San Fernando as its capital, or &quot;cabecera&quot;. Captain Toribio Ruiz de la Escalera was appointed as the first &quot;Gobernador Militar y Político&quot;.

The creation of La Union was officially ratified by a Royal Decree issued by Queen Isabella II of Spain on April 18, 1854. By the late 19th century, the migration of settlers from the Ilocos provinces resulted in San Fernando becoming predominantly inhabited by Ilocanos, alongside Ilocanized Pangasinenses and Bago people. By 1879 San Fernando population had become 10,604 since the formation of La Union province.

=== Philippine Revolution (1896-1998) ===

On September 10, 1896, shortly after the Cry of Pugad Lawin, a significant event unfolded in San Fernando when Spanish authorities uncovered a conspiracy against the colonial government. Leading the crackdown was &quot;Fray Rafael Redondo&quot;, the &quot;Vicar Forane&quot; of San Fernando, who acted swiftly against suspected revolutionaries. Among the first arrested was &quot;Dr. Lucino Almeida&quot;, a respected community figure targeted for his alleged involvement in the revolutionary movement, which had gained momentum following the events of Pugad Lawin and the increasing influence of the Katipunan, led by Andrés Bonifacio.On September 17, 1896, three native coadjutor priests from La Union, including &quot;Padre Mariano Gaerlan&quot; of San Fernando, were tortured for their alleged participation in a conspiracy against the Spanish colonial government, deepening the people&#x27;s resentment toward Spanish rule.

The revolution in San Fernando began on May 22, 1898, after the killing of a priest in Santo Tomas. San Fernando guerrillas stormed and burned houses and killed pro-Spanish sympathizers in the town. Women also became victims of brutal acts, with one storekeeper left mentally deranged.
The Philippine Revolution erupted in 1898, sparking a nationwide movement for independence. On July 22, 1898, Filipino insurgents, led by General Manuel Tinio, General Mauro Ortiz, and Major Joaquin &quot;Alejandrino&quot;, attacked the Spanish garrison in San Fernando with over 600 men. The Spanish, commanded by Colonel Jose Garcia Herrero, fortified key buildings and awaited reinforcements. Despite Tinio&#x27;s attempts at peaceful negotiation, the Spanish forces refused to surrender. After several days of deadlock, Tinio launched an assault on July 31, resulting in a fierce battle that culminated in the Spaniards&#x27; surrender. 

This event marked the signing of the &quot;Actas de Capitulaciones&quot; (Acts of Surrender). San Fernando became the 13th of 29 towns and cities to witness the Spanish capitulation, with 400 soldiers, eight officers, and substantial military resources surrendering. After a century of Spanish colonization, San Fernando was finally liberated, and for the first time since its founding on March 2, 1850, a Filipino assumed authority over the Casa Real.

=== American Regime (1899-1901) ===

After the 1898 Spanish-American War, the Philippines was ceded to the United States under the Treaty of Paris, marking the beginning of American colonization. During the Philippine-American War (1899–1902), San Fernando became a site of intense military conflict, including forced relocations, killings, and property destruction, which fueled local resistance. A key event was the U.S. naval bombardment as General Gregorio del Pilar covered President Emilio Aguinaldo’s retreat.

On August 1, 1899, the U.S. merchant steamer &quot;Saturnus&quot; attempted to dock at San Fernando but was seized by the revolutionary army under international law. Although the ship caught fire, all passengers, crew, and property were saved, and prisoners were handed over to General Arthur MacArthur. In response, U.S. Navy ships bombarded San Fernando on August 7, reducing the town to ruins. Foreign Affairs Secretary Felipe Buencamino filed diplomatic protests against the attacks, but no response was received. The bombardment continued in San Fernando, Bauang, and San Juan, destroying properties and resulting in civilian casualties.

On November 18, 1899, U.S. Expeditionary Forces under General Samuel Baldwin Marks Young entered La Union in pursuit of President Emilio Aguinaldo, leading to several battles across different towns, including the rice fields of San Fernando. Filipino revolutionaries in San Fernando were led by Captain Fortunato Gaerlan of Guerrilla Unit 3, which also operated in San Juan.

By November 20, General Young entered and captured San Fernando by November 21, describing the town as &quot;a series of the most formidable entrenchments.&quot; He took control of the revolutionary headquarters and estimated the presence of around 1,000 Filipino insurgents, several of whom were captured. Despite continued resistance, by January 1900, notable engagements, such as the battle in Malabita, San Fernando, saw Filipino forces ambushing and repelling American troops with support from La Union Insurrect Governor Lucino Almeida.

By April 1900, San Fernando was effectively pacified with the aid of Crispulo Patajo, a native of Bauang who served as a spy, scout, and leader for U.S. forces in suppressing guerrilla resistance. His efforts led to the elimination of a guerrilla company and the capture of 80 rifles. By May 1, 1901, the Tinio Brigade formally surrendered to the Americans in Ilocos Sur.

On August 14, 1901, Governor General William Howard Taft arrived in San Fernando, introducing American civil governance. Shortly after, Don Joaquin Ortega was appointed as La Union’s first Civil Governor. However, resistance persisted, and on November 8, 1901, Colonel Juan M. Gutierrez was publicly executed in the town plaza of San Fernando. Despite these hardships, American rule replaced Spanish governance with democratic institutions and economic reforms.

When the American take over it significant changes in education, agriculture, healthcare, suffrage, and civil rights, fostering Filipino participation in governance. The arrival of American educators, known as Thomasites, led to the establishment of public schools, often utilizing abandoned Spanish convents in San Fernando. Civil government institutions, including a provincial capitol and public health offices, were also established to address health crises such as cholera outbreaks, contributing to broader Americanization efforts in the town.

Infrastructure development was a key aspect of American rule, with the construction of roads, ports, railways, and airports aimed at consolidating colonial administration and promoting economic growth. Notable projects included the establishment of Camp Wallace in 1903 on Poro Islet under Captain Frank Tompkins, which served as a strategic military reservation. Additionally, the San Fernando Wharf, constructed in 1921, played a crucial role in trade and military logistics.

The establishment of the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935 granted San Fernando increased political autonomy while maintaining American influence. This period saw efforts to promote local governance and economic development, though colonial structures remained largely intact. Full independence was achieved on July 4, 1946, with the formal recognition of Philippine sovereignty.

=== World War II ===
In the Second World War, the last battle of San Fernando was fought during the Japanese occupation at Barangay Bacsil. The Bacsil Ridge Monument was built on the site in the city, the north-eastern portion of the town plaza. The victory enabled the establishment of the United States Army Base, Base M at Poro Point (a buildup area for the Japan invasion) and a US Navy Base. The town was liberated in 1945.
==== The Battle of Bacsil Ridge ====
The Battle of Bacsil Ridge which was fought in March 1945 was one of the main battles of the Philippines Campaign of the Second World War between the Filipino soldiers under the 121st Infantry Regiment, Philippine Commonwealth Army, USAFIP-NL, under the command of Russell W. Volckmann, and the Japanese Imperial forces under General Tomoyuki Yamashita.

The Battle of Bacsil Ridge ended the month-long battle for control of San Fernando. The Japanese defenders called the Hayashi Detachment, composed of 3,000 armed troops and 2,000 unarmed support forces, took hold of San Fernando and its surrounding areas and denied entry to the port of the city and a road leading to Baguio. As part of the San Fernando-Bacsil Operations, the 1st Battalion of 121st Infantry were sent to loosen the enemy positions starting late February with the assistance of the Allied Air Force.

The 1st Battalion made a general attack to the ridge on March 16, 1945 and fought the Japanese defenders until the capture of Bacsil on March 19. On the same day, the 3rd battalion captured Reservoir Hill. The Battle of Bacsil Ridge between the Filipino guerrillas and the Japanese Forces resulted in the recapture of the city of San Fernando, La Union. which resulted in the capture of San Fernando, La Union on March 23, 1945, and Bacnotan, La Union and the military offensive throughout the province ended on March 24 after two months of fighting.

=== Martial Law Era ===
Although Ilocanos are perceived to have been largely silent about the authoritarian practices of Ferdinand Marcos&#x27; administration, there were still San Fernando residents willing to express their objections its various abuses. This included San Fernando-raised student activists Romulo and Armando Palabay, UP Students and La Union National High School alumni who were imprisoned for their protest activities in San Fernando, tortured at Camp Olivas in Pampanga, and later separately killed before the end of Martial Law. 

The respective martyrdoms of Romulo (age 22) and Armando (age 21) were later honored when their names were etched on the Wall of Remembrance at the Philippines’ Bantayog ng mga Bayani, which honors the heroes and martyrs who fought the authoritarian regime.

=== Cityhood ===

On May 14, 1996, the Sangguniang Bayan of San Fernando passed &quot;Resolution No. 20&quot;, formally requesting the House of Representatives and Congress of the Philippines to convert the Municipality of San Fernando into a Component City. At that time, San Fernando had fulfilled the fundamental requirements for cityhood in accordance with the provisions of the &quot;Local Government Code of 1991&quot;. According to a certification from the &quot;Bureau of Local Government Finance&quot;, the municipality&#x27;s average annual income for the calendar years 1994 and 1995, based on 1991 constant prices, was P 44,351,821.66. Additionally, the &quot;Land Management Bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources&quot; certified that San Fernando covered a total land area of 10,526 hectares, exceeding the minimum requirement of 10,000 hectares.

Following a thorough review and careful assessment of the Sangguniang Bayan of San Fernando&#x27;s petition, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of La Union adopted Resolution No. 425-96, endorsing the cityhood bid to the House of Representatives and Congress.

House Bill 7594, titled &quot;An Act Converting the Municipality of San Fernando, La Union into a Component City to be Known as the City of San Fernando,&quot; was sponsored by &quot;Congressman Victor F. Ortega&quot; (1st District, La Union) and approved by the House of Representatives. The Senate subsequently approved the bill, sponsored by Senators Vicente Sotto III and Juan Flavier. On February 13, 1998, &quot;Republic Act 8509&quot; was signed into law by President Fidel V. Ramos. Finally, on March 20, 1998, the residents of San Fernando overwhelmingly voted in favor of the law during a plebiscite, fulfilling the long-held aspiration for San Fernando to attain cityhood.

==Annual Community Events==

The City of San Fernando, like many other regions in the Philippines, celebrates its festivities with great enthusiasm. The city&#x27;s annual fiesta takes place from January 28 to February 15, featuring a trade fair near the city hall. Additional celebrations occur in March to commemorate its cityhood.

* Pindangan Festival: Held annually during the cityhood anniversary, this festival features a street dance competition showcasing three significant socio-historical elements of the city&#x27;s identity: the Pindangan Ruins, the merging of two historical settlements that formed the town, and the traditional fish preservation technique known as &quot;pindang.&quot; Participants are categorized into groups from primary, secondary, and tertiary schools, as well as contingents from barangays and districts.
* Commemoration of Bacsil Ridge: This event honors the heroism displayed during the recapture of Bacsil during World War II. On March 19, 1945, the 121st Infantry of USAFIP defeated Japanese forces, leading to the liberation of Bacsil Ridge. Three days later, the town of San Fernando was freed.
* Ma-tzu Festival: A unique religious celebration blending Chinese and Roman Catholic traditions, this festival honors Ma-tzu, the Chinese goddess of the sea, and the Virgin of Caysasay, who is revered by the Filipino-Chinese community as the reincarnation of Ma-tzu. Ma-tzu is believed to provide protection and guidance to fishermen and sailors.
* Rabii ti Pammadyaw: This event recognizes outstanding individuals who have brought honor to the city through excellence in their respective fields.
* Grand People’s Parade: Also known as the Parade of Lights, this parade takes place along the city&#x27;s major thoroughfares. Participants include drum and lyre groups, beauty pageant contestants, and others. Awards are given for the best float, costume, and choreography.

<text>Jonathan Simon Djanogly (born 3 June 1965) is an English politician and solicitor, who was the Conservative Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Huntingdon from 2001 to 2024. Djanogly has been Trade and Industry Spokesman shadowing the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, Shadow Solicitor General for England and Wales and was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of Justice from 2010 to 2012. 

Following a vote by local party members, on 21 April 2023 Djanogly announced his decision not to seek re-election as an MP at the 2024 general election.

==Early life==
Djanogly was born in London to a British Jewish family, the son of multimillionaire textile manufacturer Sir Harry Djanogly and Lady Djanogly.

==Education==
Djanogly was privately educated at University College School, an independent school for boys in Hampstead in North London, followed by Oxford Polytechnic in Oxford, where he was elected chairman of the Conservative Association in 1987, and he earned a Bachelor of Arts in law and politics in 1987. He took his law finals at the College of Law, Guildford, in 1988.

==Professional career==
He joined SJ Berwin, London, in 1988 as a trainee solicitor, was admitted as a solicitor in 1990, and served as corporate finance partner between 1998 and 2009.

==Political career==
Djanogly was elected as a councillor for Regents Park ward in the City of Westminster in 1994 and was re-elected in 1998. He unsuccessfully contested the seat of Oxford East at the 1997 general election. Before the 2001 general election he was selected as the Conservative Party candidate for the safe seat of Huntingdon, following the retirement of former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Sir John Major. Djanogly resigned from his council seat early in 2001, shortly before the general election campaign.

At the 2001 general election, Djanogly held the Huntingdon seat comfortably with a majority of 12,792 votes and has remained as the MP for the constituency ever since. He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 2 July 2001.

He served on the Trade and Industry Select committee from 2001. He also campaigned for better protection against animal rights extremists, who had been targeting employees of Huntingdon Life Sciences in his constituency.

In 2004, he was promoted to the frontbench by Michael Howard as an opposition spokesman on Home Affairs, and served as Solicitor General between May 2004 and May 2010, succeeding Nick Hawkins. In 2005 Djanogly was also appointed a shadow Business Minister in the team shadowing the Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom) (now the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills) where until the 2010 general election he worked on corporate governance and business regulations.

Since leaving Government in 2012, Djanogly has been elected Secretary of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Corporate Governance and Joint Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Corporate Responsibility. Djanogly served eight months as a member of the Public Accounts Committee. until July 2024

Djanogly was opposed to Brexit before the 2016 referendum. In December 2017 Djanogly voted along with ten other Conservative MPs against the government, and in favour of guaranteeing Parliament a &quot;meaningful vote&quot; on any deal Theresa May agreed with Brussels over Brexit.

===Courts and legal aid===
Following the formation of the coalition government Djanogly was named on 14 May 2010 as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of Justice, a post he held until September 2012. His role included the oversight of legal aid and legal services, HM Courts Service, as well as the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

As part of the Ministry of Justice&#x27;s target to reduce its spending by £2 billion, Djanogly was tasked with reducing the legal aid budget by £350 million. In June 2011, he was one of the Ministers that introduced the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill (LASPO) to Parliament. Djanogly led the Bill process and it became law on 1 May 2012.

On 29 March 2011, Djanogly launched a consultation: &quot;Solving disputes in the County Courts&quot;, initiating a general review of civil law procedures, that included; increasing the small claims limit to £10,000, creating a single County Court and extending mediation assessment to all small claims.

In an attempt to counter a perceived &quot;compensation culture&quot; in litigation in September 2011, Djanogly announced the Government&#x27;s intention to ban referral fees in personal injury claims. The ban was included in the LASPO Bill, together with provisions preventing the recovery of claimant solicitors&#x27; success fees from losing defendants, intended to reform &#x27;no win, no fee&#x27; deals.

In October 2011, Djanogly announced non-lawyers would be allowed to invest in and own legal businesses for the first time. In 2017 the impact of these changes was considered to be mixed: they had not delivered the intended reduction in the cost of legal services, but there had been improvements in management arrangements and fee structures.

In February 2012, Djanogly proposed a major legal overhaul of the bailiff industry to clamp down on bad practices. The proposals included a new regulatory body to oversee the industry, a new complaints process for debtors and clear fees so that people know what bailiffs can charge.

In July 2012, Djanogly announced the Government&#x27;s intention to introduce a certificate declaring someone as &#x27;presumed dead&#x27; to help families resolve the affairs of a missing person.

===Employment law===
As a shadow Business Minister Djanogly had proposed changes to employment law and continued this in Government. In January 2011 he launched a consultation: &quot;Resolving Workplace Disputes&quot;, jointly with Ed Davey MP (who at the time was a Business Minister). The consultation led to measures which changed the practice and procedure of employment tribunals and how disputes could be resolved without recourse to tribunals. In July 2012 Djanogly also revealed plans to tailor employment tribunal fees to encourage businesses and workers to mediate or settle a dispute rather than go to a full hearing from summer 2013.

Djanogly said, &quot;It&#x27;s not fair on the taxpayer to foot the entire £84 million bill for people to escalate workplace disputes to a tribunal. We want people, where they can, to pay a fair contribution for the system they are using, which will encourage them to look for alternatives.&quot; Bringing a claim or an appeal to the employment tribunal is currently free of charge with the full cost being met by the taxpayer. By introducing fees, people using employment tribunals will start to contribute a significant proportion of the £84 million cost of running the system. The aim is to reduce the taxpayer subsidy of these tribunals by transferring some of the cost to those who use the service, while protecting access to justice for all. HM Courts &amp; Tribunals Service figures published in September 2014 subsequently showed that tribunals received 71% fewer claims in the quarter April to June than in the same period in 2013 – the smallest figure since records began in 2008/09.

===Court reform===
Djanogly was the Minister responsible for the courts service during the August riots of 2011 when a decision was taken to direct the riot cases to a limited number of magistrates courts sitting 24 hours a day for seven days a week. Djanogly was also responsible for the merger of HM Courts Service with the Tribunals Service to create HMCTS on 1 April 2011. There were also major changes to the court estate, with 93 magistrates courts and 49 county courts being closed (out of a total of 530 courts), alongside proposals to reinvest £22 million of savings into the modernisation of the remaining court estate.

===Family law===
As Minister for Family Law, Djanogly&#x27;s main thrust was preparing the Government&#x27;s response to, and implementation of, the Family Justice Review conducted by David Norgrove, which reported in November 2011. In private family law, Djanogly championed mediation saying, &quot;Mediation for example may well play a larger role in resolving family justice matters in the future. As well as avoiding the expense of court, it has already been shown that in some circumstances, agreements reached through mediation are better adhered to than court judgements.&quot; In public family law, the focus became a need to reduce the length of care cases which, on average, were taking 61 weeks. Djanogly said &quot;In my view there is no time to waste in reforming a system which has in the past years under-delivered for the many families, children, practitioners and staff that it is meant to be there to support.&quot;

===Defamation===
In May 2012 Djanogly was one of the ministers who introduced the Defamation Bill and he led on its progress through the House of Commons until it reached Report stage. The bill satisfied the coalition agreement to reform the law of defamation.

==Controversy==
===2009 expenses scandal===
In the 2009 expenses scandal it was suggested that Djanogly improperly claimed expenses for a &quot;cleaner&quot; who was actually a childminder. In response Djanogly stated that the person in question was employed as a cleaner although &quot;there would clearly have been times during evenings when she would have been there with a child alone, but this was not her job or what she was paid to do&quot; and acknowledged that the person received no other payment for any services provided. In May 2009, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; disclosed that Mr Djanogly claimed almost £5,000 on his parliamentary expenses for the installation of gates at his constituency home. The MP installed the gates following security fears, after he helped constituents threatened by animal rights activists, and he was not required to repay the sum following the Legg audit of MPs&#x27; expenses in 2010.

Djanogly initially repaid £25,000 but denied that his arrangements had been improper. The Legg audit subsequently found that £17,364.76 had been improperly claimed but did not require any further repayment as more than this amount had already been received.

===Private detectives===
In September 2010 it was revealed that Djanology had hired private detectives in 2009 to uncover the source of leaks to media about his parliamentary expenses. Following a complaint to the UK Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office by John Mann MP in connection with Djanogly&#x27;s hiring of private detectives, on 27 July 2011 the Information Commissioner said that he would not be investigating Djanogly for breaches of the Data Protection Act.

===Regulation of claims management firms===
In October 2011 Djanogly was stripped of his role of regulating Claims Management firms after it was revealed he failed to disclose conflicts of interest regarding his family members holding shares in said companies. The Ministry of Justice said &quot;The Cabinet Secretary has concluded that Jonathan Djanogly took the appropriate steps to prevent any conflict between his financial interests and his Ministerial duties. There is no evidence that he acted in any way other than in the public interest.&quot;

In a letter to Labour&#x27;s justice spokesman, Andy Slaughter, who had raised the matter, Gus O&#x27;Donnell said that while there is &quot;no suggestion of any impropriety in relation&quot; to Djanogly&#x27;s brother-in-law&#x27;s firms that &quot;for the avoidance of doubt decisions about the regulation of individual (claims management companies) should henceforth be handled by another minister&quot;. Djanogly requested that the Claims Management Regulation Unit be overseen by a different Justice Minister, to avoid any possible distraction from this important issue after it was suggested that he and his family could personally profit. Djanogly stated that neither he nor his Labour predecessor had ever had to make a decision in relation to the claims management unit, because decisions were delegated to officials, but it seemed prudent to head off any future allegation. Claims management regulation policy however remained within his brief and on 22 August 2012, Djanogly launched a consultation to amend the conduct rules of claims managers and on 28 August 2012 announced that from 2013, the legal ombudsman would handle claims management complaints.

===2022–23 legal claim by housekeeper===
In May 2022, Djanogly&#x27;s wife, Miss Rebecca Silk, lost an employment tribunal to a former employee, Miss H. Settas, which was later commented on in some parts of the press including the Telegraph in February 2023 following an interview given by Miss Settas to the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;.

==Personal life==
Djanogly has been married to Rebecca Jane Silk since 1991 and has two children, a son and a daughter. He is the son-in-law of former Wimbledon champion Angela Buxton.

<doc id="420195" wikidata="Q1154795" url="?curid=420195" title="DOS Protected Mode Interface">
<text>In computing, the DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) is a specification introduced in 1989 which allows a DOS program to run in protected mode, giving access to many features of the new PC processors of the time not available in real mode. It was initially developed by Microsoft for Windows 3.0, although Microsoft later turned control of the specification over to an industry committee with open membership. Almost all modern DOS extenders are based on DPMI and allow DOS programs to address all memory available in the PC and to run in protected mode (mostly in ring 3, least privileged).

== Overview ==
DPMI stands for DOS Protected Mode Interface.
It is an API that allows a program to run in protected mode on 80286 series and later processors, and do the
calls to real mode without having to set up these CPU modes manually. DPMI also provides the functions for managing
various resources, notably memory. This allows the DPMI-enabled programs to work in
multi-tasking OSes,
allowing an OS kernel to distribute such resources between multiple applications. DPMI provides only the functionality that
needs to be implemented in supervisor mode. It can be
thought of as a single-tasking microkernel. The rest of the functionality is available to DPMI-enabled programs
via the calls to real-mode DOS and BIOS services, allowing the DPMI API itself to remain mostly independent of DOS.
Things that make DPMI API DOS-specific, are just 3 functions for managing DOS memory, and the letter &quot;D&quot; in the &quot;DPMI&quot; acronym.

A DPMI service can be 16-bit, 32-bit, or &quot;universal&quot; and is called the &quot;DPMI kernel&quot;, &quot;DPMI host&quot;, or &quot;DPMI server&quot;. It is provided either by the host operating system (&quot;virtual DPMI host&quot;) or by a DOS extender (&quot;real DPMI host&quot;). The DPMI kernel can be a part of a DOS extender such as in DOS/4GW or DOS/32A, or separate, like CWSDPMI or HDPMI.

The primary use of DPMI API is to allow DOS extenders to provide the host-OS-agnostic environment.
DOS extender checks the presence of a DPMI kernel, and installs its own only if the one was not installed already. This allows
DOS-extended programs to run either in a multitasking OS that provides its own DPMI kernel, or directly
under bare-metal DOS, in which case DOS extender uses its own DPMI kernel. Windows 3.x and 9x&#x27;s user-mode
kernels are built with a DOS extender, so they fully rely on a DPMI API that is provided by Windows&#x27;s ring-0 kernel.

== History ==
The first DPMI specification drafts were published in 1989 by Microsoft&#x27;s Ralph Lipe. While based on a prototypical version of DPMI for Windows 3.0 in 386 enhanced mode, several features of this implementation were removed from the official specification, including a feature named MS-DOS Extensions or DOS API translation that had been proposed by Ralph Lipe in the original drafts. Most of it was implementing DOS and BIOS interfaces (due to this history some INT 21h APIs like 4Ch have to be implemented by all DPMI implementations). DPMI version 0.9 was published in 1990 by the newly formed DPMI Committee. The version number 0.9 of the resulting specification was chosen to reflect the stripped-down nature and incomplete status of the standard the members of the DPMI Committee could agree upon. While Windows reports DPMI version 0.9 for compatibility, it actually implements the other parts as well, since they present a vital part of the system. This undocumented full nature of DPMI has become known as &quot;true DPMI&quot; in the industry. The DPMI standard was not the only effort to overcome the shortcomings of the VCPI specification. At the same time that Microsoft developed DPMI for Windows 3.0, another industry alliance including Intel&#x27;s Software Focus Group, Lotus, Digital Research, Interactive Systems and others developed a specification named Extended VCPI (XVCPI) to make the memory management and multitasking capabilities of the 386 available for extended DOS applications.
When it turned out that Microsoft&#x27;s DPMI proposal addressed a number of similar issues and was supported by Windows, these efforts led to the creation of the DPMI Committee in February 1990 during a meeting at Intel in Santa Clara.

In 1991, the DPMI Committee revised DPMI to version 1.0 in order to incorporate a number of clarifications and extensions, but it still did not include the missing &quot;true DPMI&quot; bits implemented in Windows. In fact, &quot;true DPMI&quot; never became part of the official DPMI specification, and Windows likewise never implemented the DPMI 1.0 extensions (and not many DPMI hosts did).

While DPMI is tailored to run extended DOS application software in protected mode and extended memory, it is not particularly well suited for resident system extensions. Another specification named DPMS, developed by Digital Research / Novell around 1992, specifically addresses requirements to easily relocate modified DOS driver software into extended memory and run them in protected mode, thereby reducing their conventional memory footprint down to small stubs. This is also supported by Helix Cloaking.

The DPMI &quot;method&quot; is specific to DOS and the IBM PC. Other computer types were upgraded from 16-bit to 32-bit, and the advanced program support was provided by upgrading the operating system with a new 32-bit API and new memory management/addressing capabilities. For example, the OS/2 core system supports 32-bit programs, and can be run without the GUI. The DPMI solution appears to be mainly needed to address third party need to get DOS protected mode programs running stably on Windows 3.x before the dominant operating system vendor, Microsoft, could or would address the future of 32-bit Windows. In addition, Microsoft didn&#x27;t see the answer to the 32-bit transition as a 32-bit DOS, but rather a 32-bit Windows with a completely different (and incompatible) API.

=== Compatibility ===
While Windows 3.0 implements &quot;true DPMI&quot; and reports support for DPMI 0.9, DPMI version 1.0 was never implemented in Microsoft Windows, so most programs and DOS extenders were mostly only written for version 0.9. Few extenders, however, implement &quot;true DPMI&quot;.

Beta versions of Qualitas 386MAX implemented &quot;true DPMI&quot; and could run Windows&#x27; KRNL386.EXE from the command line, but it was claimed that was disabled in the released product in an internal email. However, DPMIONE (by Bob Smith based on the 386MAX code) can do it. Currently DPMIONE and 386MAX is also the only DPMI host which supports DPMI 1.0 completely (e.g. uncommitted memory) and they are the main supporter of DPMI 1.0.

The KRNL386.SYS (aka &quot;MultiMAX&quot;) of DR DOS &quot;Panther&quot; and &quot;StarTrek&quot;, which has been under development since 1991, and the EMM386.EXE memory managers of Novell DOS 7, Caldera OpenDOS and DR-DOS 7.02 and higher have built-in support for DPMI when loaded with the codice_1 option. KRNL386.SYS even had a command line option codice_2 to provide support for either DPMI 1.0 or 0.9. DOS API translation was referred to as &quot;called interrupt 21 from protected mode&quot;. Multiuser DOS, System Manager and REAL/32 support DPMI as well.

The most famous separate DPMI kernel is probably CWSDPMI; it supports DPMI 0.9, but no undocumented &quot;DOS API translation&quot;.
Another variant called PMODE by &quot;TRAN&quot; aka Thomas Pytel was popular with 32-bit programmers during the demo scene of the 1990s.
Many games used DOS/4GW, which was developed by Rational Systems as a subset of DOS/4G and was distributed with the Watcom C compiler.

HDPMI (part of HX DOS Extender) provides &quot;DOS API translation&quot; and almost complete DPMI 1.0 implementation.

=== DPMI Committee ===
The DPMI 1.0 Committee met between 1990 through 1991 and consisted of 12 groups:
* Borland International (Borland C, Turbo Pascal)
* IBM Corporation (PC DOS, OS/2)
* AI Architects/Ergo Computer Solutions/Eclipse Computer Solutions/Ergo Computing (OS/286, OS/386 DOS extenders)
* Intelligent Graphics Corporation (VM/386 multi-user DOS)
* Intel Corporation (286, 386, 486 microprocessors)
* Locus Computing Corporation (Merge)
* Lotus Development Corporation (Lotus 1-2-3)
* Microsoft Corporation (MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows)
* Phar Lap Software (DOS|286, DOS|386, TNT)
* Phoenix Technologies (Phoenix BIOS, PMate, PForCe, Plink-86)
* Quarterdeck Office Systems (QEMM, DESQview, DESQview/X)
* Rational Systems/Tenberry Software (DOS/16M, DOS/4G, DOS/4GW DOS extenders)

<text>James Dobbin (26 May 1941 – 6 September 2014) was a British Labour and Co-operative Party politician and microbiologist who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Heywood and Middleton from 1997 until his death in 2014.

==Early life==
Jim Dobbin was born in Fife, Scotland, the son of a coal miner, and educated at Catholic schools. He later studied bacteriology and virology at Napier College, Edinburgh.

He worked as a microbiologist within the NHS for 33 years until 1994, mainly at the Royal Oldham Hospital. He was elected chairman of the Rochdale Constituency Labour Party for a year in 1980.

==Political career==
In 1983 he was elected as a councillor in the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale, becoming the Labour group leader in 1994, and became the leader of the council in 1996. He stepped down from both the National Health Service (NHS) and the council at Rochdale on his election to the House of Commons. In 1992 he had unsuccessfully contested the Bury North seat, coming second to the sitting Conservative MP Alistair Burt, by 4,764 votes.

Dobbin was elected to the House of Commons at the 1997 General Election for the safe Labour seat of Heywood and Middleton on the retirement of the Labour MP Jim Callaghan. He held the seat comfortably with a majority of 17,542 and remained its MP for the rest of his life. He made his maiden speech on 30 July 1997. He was a member of the European Scrutiny Select committee from 1998 to 2014.

In February 2012, he signed a petition sponsored by the Coalition for Marriage which states &quot;I support the legal definition of marriage which is the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. I oppose any attempt to redefine it.&quot;

In February 2013, Dobbin voted against the second reading of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. Subsequently, in May 2013 the MP voted against the bill’s third and final reading, opposing the legalisation of same-sex marriage within England and Wales.

Dobbin was heavily criticised for his rudeness to cyclists on the &quot;House of Commons Transport Select Committee to Discuss Cycling&quot; in December 2013.

===Expenses===
Dobbin employed his wife to be his secretary in the House of Commons, a practice which has attracted significant national debate, but remains permissible under House of Commons rules. Rochdale council leader Colin Lambert, Labour councillor Alan Godson, as well as former Labour councillor Brian Leather, were employed by Dobbin, and remunerated from his parliamentary expenses.

In May 2009 it was revealed that Dobbin claimed more public funds for staff than the other MPs in Greater Manchester: £99,700. He defended this by observing that he also had the largest number of constituents. Nationally, he had one of the lowest overall expense bills, with 504 out of 646 MPs having higher expense claims than him.

==Death==
Dobbin died in Słupsk, Poland, on 6 September 2014, aged 73. He was in the country for a Council of Europe visit, on which he was accompanied by Lord Prescott and MP Alan Meale. He had attended an official dinner during which the participants drank a shot of spirits between each course, and his blood alcohol level was 0.399, nearly five times the UK drink-drive limit. Having felt unwell at the end of the meal, he was taken to bed. During the night, his wife was unable to wake him and it was later discovered that food had entered his lungs thus stopping his breathing. His death was investigated by a British coroner who ruled &#x27;death by misadventure&#x27;.

His funeral consisted of a Requiem Mass held at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Evangelist, the Roman Catholic cathedral in Salford, on 20 September 2014. It was attended by senior figures in the world of politics, including Ed Miliband, the leader of the Labour Party, and John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons. He was later interred during a private burial.

==Personal life==
Dobbin chaired the All Party Parliamentary Pro-Life Group and campaigned strongly for a change to British abortion law. A devout Roman Catholic, he was awarded and invested as a Knight of the Pontifical Order of St Gregory the Great from Pope Benedict XVI. Dobbin was also honoured by the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George under the grandmastership of the Duke of Castro with the rank of Knight of Merit with Star.

He married Patricia Russell in 1964; the couple had two sons and two daughters.

<text>Sir Brian Harold Donohoe (born 10 September 1948) is a former British Labour politician and former trade union official, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Central Ayrshire from 2005 until losing his seat in 2015. Prior to constituency boundary changes in 2005, he was MP for Cunninghame South and was first elected in 1992. Bolton

==Early life==

Born in Kilmarnock, he was educated at primary schools before attending Irvine Royal Academy. He later attended Kilmarnock Technical College, where he received a national certificate in Engineering in 1972.

He was an apprentice fitter and turner at the Ailsa Shipyard in Troon from 1965, before becoming a draughtsman in 1969. In 1977, he spent a few months as an engineer at the Hunterston nuclear power plant, before joining ICI Organics Division as a draughtsman later in the year.

In 1981, Donohoe became a district officer for the National Association of Local Government Officers (NALGO), where he remained until his election to Westminster.

An active trade unionist, he was a convenor for the Technical, Administrative and Supervisory Section (TASS) 1969–81. He was elected as the treasurer of the Cunninghame South Constituency Labour Party for eight years in 1983.

==Parliamentary career==

Donohoe was elected to the House of Commons at the 1992 general election for the Cunninghame South constituency after the retirement of the previous Labour MP David Lambie. Donohoe held the seat with a majority of 10,680 votes, and continued as the MP until 2015, when he was defeated at the general election by Philippa Whitford of the Scottish National Party by 13,589 votes. He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 13 May 1992. In parliament he served as a member of the Transport Select committee, in its various forms, from 1993 until 2005. He was a member of the Administration Select Committee from the 2005 general election.

In November 2008, Donohoe was one of eighteen MPs who signed a Commons motion backing a Team GB football team at the 2012 London Olympic Games, saying football &quot;should not be any different from other competing sports and our young talent should be allowed to show their skills on the world stage&quot;. The football governing bodies of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all opposed to a Great Britain team, fearing it would stop them competing as individual nations in future tournaments.

In February 2013, Cooper voted against the second reading of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. Subsequently, in May 2013 the MP voted against the bill’s third and final reading, opposing the legalisation of same-sex marriage within England and Wales.

Donohoe&#x27;s seat of Cunninghame South was abolished, and between 2005 and 2015 he represented the redrawn seat of Ayrshire Central.

In the 2015 United Kingdom general election Donohoe lost his Central Ayrshire seat to Philippa Whitford of the SNP by a margin of 13,589 votes. After his defeat, Donohoe said that he was &quot;disappointed&quot; to lose but that there was a silver lining: &quot;I&#x27;m of an age where I can now turn round with the greatest delight and tell people to &quot;fuck off!&quot; which I haven&#x27;t been able to do for a hell of a long time in both my trade union life and also in this one. You have to take all sorts coming through the door and be kind, considerate and generous with your time and sometimes you wonder why. But at the end of it you&#x27;re there and I&#x27;ve always made the pledge as an MP that I wasn&#x27;t just there to represent the people who voted for me, I was there to help.&quot;

After the Chilcot Report investigating the Iraq War was released, Donohoe stated he was &quot;not convinced&quot; it gave any fresh insight into the controversial decision to invade Iraq. Donohoe had voted for the invasion, but a year later he said he would have voted against had he known Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction.

Donohoe was knighted in the 2019 Birthday Honours.

==Personal life==
He married Christine Pawson in 1973 and they have two sons. He takes a particular interest in renationalising the British railway system. Donohoe is a serving Special Constable with the British Transport Police. He is also a devoted fan of the television soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. He is the secretary of Rangers Supporters Club.

<doc id="420201" wikidata="Q1143380" url="?curid=420201" title="Extended memory">
<text>In DOS memory management, extended memory refers to memory above the first megabyte (220 bytes) of address space in an IBM PC or compatible with an 80286 or later processor. The term is mainly used under the DOS and Windows operating systems. DOS programs, running in real mode or virtual x86 mode, cannot directly access this memory, but are able to do so through an application programming interface (API) called the &quot;Extended Memory Specification&quot; (XMS). This API is implemented by a driver (such as HIMEM.SYS) or the operating system kernel, which takes care of memory management and copying memory between conventional and extended memory, by temporarily switching the processor into protected mode. In this context, the term &quot;extended memory&quot; may refer to either the whole of the extended memory or only the portion available through this API.

Extended memory can also be accessed directly by DOS programs running in protected mode using VCPI or DPMI, two (different and incompatible) methods of using protected mode under DOS.

Extended memory should not be confused with expanded memory (EMS), an earlier method for expanding the IBM PC&#x27;s memory capacity beyond 640 kB (655,360 bytes) using an expansion card with bank switched memory modules. Because of the available support for expanded memory in popular applications, device drivers were developed that emulated expanded memory using extended memory. Later two additional methods were developed allowing direct access to small portions of additional memory above 640 KB from real mode. One of these is referred to as the high memory area (HMA), consisting of the first nearly 64 KB of extended memory, and the other is referred to as the upper memory area (UMA; also referred to as upper memory blocks or UMBs), located in the address range between 640 KB and 1 MB which the IBM PC designates for hardware adapters and ROM.

==Overview==
On x86-based PCs, extended memory is only available with an Intel 80286 processor or higher. Only these chips can directly address more than 1 megabyte of RAM. The earlier 8086/8088 processors can make use of more than 1 MB of RAM if one employs special hardware to make selectable parts of it appear at addresses below 1 MB.

On a 286 or better PC equipped with more than 640 kB of RAM, the additional memory would generally be re-mapped above the 1 MB boundary, since the IBM PC architecture reserves addresses between 640 kB and 1 MB for system ROM and peripherals.

Extended memory is not accessible in real mode (except for a small portion called the high memory area). Only applications executing in protected mode can use extended memory directly. A supervising protected-mode operating system such as Microsoft Windows manages application programs&#x27; access to memory. The processor makes this memory available through the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) and one or more Local Descriptor Tables (LDTs). The memory is &quot;protected&quot; in the sense that memory segments assigned a local descriptor cannot be accessed by another program because that program uses a different LDT, and memory segments assigned a global descriptor can have their access rights restricted, causing a processor exception (e.g., a general protection fault or GPF) on violation. This prevents programs running in protected mode from interfering with each other&#x27;s memory.

A protected-mode operating system such as Microsoft Windows can also run real-mode programs and provide expanded memory to them. The DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) is Microsoft&#x27;s prescribed method for a DOS program to access extended memory under a multitasking environment.

== &quot;Extended Memory Specification&quot; (XMS) ==
The Extended Memory Specification (XMS) is the specification describing the use of IBM PC extended memory in real mode for storing data (but not for running executable code in it). Memory is made available by extended memory manager (XMM) software such as HIMEM.SYS. The XMM functions are accessible by direct calls to a variable address that can be found through software interrupt 2Fh function 4310h.

XMS version 2.0, released in July 1988, allowed for up to 64 MB of memory. With XMS version 3.0 this increased to 4 GB (232 bytes). The difference is a direct result of the sizes of the values used to report the amounts of total and unallocated (free) extended memory in 1 KB (1024-byte) units: XMS 2.0 uses 16-bit unsigned integers, capable of representing a maximum of (65535 * 1 KB) = 64 MB, while XMS 3.0 adds new alternate functions that use 32-bit unsigned integers, capable of representing (4 G * 1 KB) = 4 TB (4 terabytes) but limited by the specification to 4 GB. (4 GB is the address range of the 80386 and the 80486, the only 32-bit Intel x86 CPUs that existed when XMS 3.0 was published in 1991.) XMS 3.0 retains the original XMS 2.0 API functions with their original 64 MB limit but adds new &quot;super extended memory&quot; functions that support 4 GB of extended memory (minus the first 1 MB) and can be called only with a 32-bit CPU (since these &quot;super&quot; functions use 32-bit CPU registers to pass values). To differentiate between the possibly different amount of memory that might be available to applications, depending on which version of the specification they were developed to, the latter may be referred to as super extended memory (SXMS).

The extended memory manager is also responsible for managing allocations in the high memory area (HMA) and the upper memory area (UMA; also referred to as upper memory blocks or UMBs). In practice the upper memory area will be provided by the expanded memory manager (EMM), after which DOS will try to allocate them all and manage them itself.

<text>Frank Doran (13 April 1949 – 31 October 2017) was a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Aberdeen South from 1987 to 1992, when he lost his seat. He was re-elected in 1997 to Aberdeen Central, and most recently represented Aberdeen North. He was the husband of former Labour MP Dame Joan Ruddock.

He announced he would be standing down in 2015, saying &quot;I don’t want to be wandering around here as a skeleton...I think that we need to allow younger people to come through.”

==Education and early career==
Doran attended the Ainslie Park Secondary School (later the Ainslie Park High School) in East Pilton and Leith Academy in Leith before leaving school at age 16. He took a job at the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board and was promoted to junior clerk in the legal department within a year. There, he was encouraged in his interest in law by Assistant Secretary of the Board Douglas Nellands, and he started taking night classes. After a few years, he attended the University of Dundee, where he was awarded a LLB degree in 1975. He was admitted as a solicitor in 1977 and was in practice until 1988.

==Political career==
He unsuccessfully contested the European Parliament seat of Scotland North East in 1984. He was elected to the House of Commons at the 1987 general election for Aberdeen South by defeating the sitting Conservative and Unionist MP Gerry Malone. He was promoted to the opposition frontbench by Neil Kinnock in 1988, as a spokesperson on energy, leading on oil and gas.

Doran lost the Aberdeen South seat at the 1992 general election by the Conservative and Unionist candidate Raymond Robertson. This was the only seat in which an incumbent Labour MP who stood for re-election lost to a Conservative candidate at that election. During his time out of Parliament, Doran was appointed by the Trade Unions to run the statutory political fund ballot campaign for the majority of Trade Unions who had political funds, until he was re-elected at the 1997 general election for the new constituency of Aberdeen Central.

He was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of State at the Department of Trade and Industry Ian McCartney in 1997. He remained in position when McCartney transferred to the Cabinet Office in 1999, after which he became a member of the Culture, Media and Sport Select committee in 2001.

Following changes to the electoral boundaries in Scotland, the constituency of Aberdeen Central was abolished prior to the 2005 general election, Doran was forced to compete against the incumbent Aberdeen North MP, Malcolm Savidge, for the Labour Party candidacy in a much-altered Aberdeen North seat. Doran won the nomination, and was elected to represent the new Aberdeen North seat with a majority of 6,795 votes. The victory gave Frank Doran the unique distinction of having represented Aberdeen South, Aberdeen Central and Aberdeen North during his parliamentary career.

Doran was, on 20 July 2005, elected Chairman of the Administration Committee, and in this role he sat on the Finance and Services, Liaison and Works of Art committees. Doran served as Chairman until the end of the Parliament on 11 May 2010. He was Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Works of Art, the Secretary to the All-Party Fisheries Group, the GMB Parliamentary Group, the Trade Union Group of Labour MPs, the All Party Dance Group, and he is also Treasurer of All-Party Oil and Gas Group.

==Votes==
In March 2003, Doran voted that the case had not yet been made for war against Iraq. He voted against a motion calling for an independent inquiry by a committee of Privy Counsellors into the Iraq War in 2007.

He voted against the replacement of the Trident system.

He voted in favour of allowing both unmarried heterosexual and homosexual couples to adopt, in favour of the Civil Partnership Bill, and in favour of same-sex marriage.

==Controversy of MP queue-jumping==
Doran sparked outrage when the Administration Committee that he chaired ruled that researchers and secretaries working in the House of Commons must allow MPs to jump the queue for the canteen. Staffers described the rules as &quot;feudal&quot;, and complained they were being treated as second-class citizens. Doran, however, said: &quot;You cannot have an MP standing in a queue for ages: they are very busy people&quot;. He acknowledged that the way in which staff were told about the ruling may have been better handled.

==Personal life==
Doran had two sons from his first marriage. He married, secondly, to Dame Joan Ruddock (a Labour minister), from 2010 until his death.

==Death==
Frank Doran died on 31 October 2017 in London, aged 68.

<doc id="420204" wikidata="Q209871" url="?curid=420204" title="System camera">
<text>A system camera or camera body is a camera with interchangeable components that constitutes the core of a system. Early representatives include Leica I Schraubgewinde (1930), Exakta (1936) and the Nikon F (1959). System cameras are often single-lens reflex (SLR) or twin-lens reflex (TLR) but can also be rangefinder cameras or, more recently, mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras. Voice coil motors (VCMs) are used to control the lens movement to achieve fast and accurate autofocus. The VCM moves the lens elements to focus the light onto the sensor with high precision.

Systems are usually named for the lens mount, such Nikon F-mount, Canon EF mount, and M42 mount (a non-proprietary mount using a screw thread).

Even point-and-shoot cameras usually include a tripod socket. A system camera includes at the very least a camera body and separate, interchangeable lenses, whence the alternative name interchangeable-lens camera (ILC). In addition it often includes:
* Electronic flash units matching the camera&#x27;s capabilities.
* PC socket or tripod-adapter mounts for external flash units, rather than just a hot shoe
* Mechanical, electric, or IR/RF remote shutter release.
* Extensive supplementary equipment for macro photography and photomicrography.
* Adapters for third-party or legacy lenses, including tilt-shift adapters
* For film cameras, a motor drive to advance the film automatically.
* For film cameras, different camera backs, e.g. large capacity for bulk film, or data back or datebacks for recording exposure and date information.
* Add-on correction or magnifying lenses to help focusing or composition through the viewfinder.
* Interchangeable viewfinders, including interchangeable focusing screens in the case of SLRs. Viewfinders and focusing screens could give different metering options.
* Extra-capacity battery packs, often in the form of a &quot;battery grip&quot; (a second, portrait-oriented handgrip), but also including fully external packs with cable interface
* AC adapters with dummy-battery interfaces for studio or other stationary work
* Sockets and matching cables for direct output, e.g., to a television
* Depth of field preview
* Global navigation satellite system receivers, e.g. (GPS) for geotagging
* Bluetooth or Wi-Fi networking modules

While some early mechanical interfaces are standardized across brands, optical and electronic interfaces are often proprietary. Hot shoes have a common interface for basic flash functions, but often contain proprietary contacts inside for advanced flashes and data modules.

<text>Susan Kathleen Doughty (née Powell; born 13 April 1948) is a politician in the United Kingdom. She was the Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Guildford from 2001 to 2005.

==Early life==
Doughty was born on 13 April 1948. She was brought up in York where she went to Mill Mount Grammar School for Girls on &quot;Mill Mount&quot;, whose site became All Saints&#x27; RC School after the abolition of the Grammar School scheme in 1985. 

She gained a CertED at Northumberland College and worked as a primary school teacher for one year. Doughty subsequently entered the field of management services and worked in a variety of organisations spanning sectors such as utilities, the &#x27;Big 4&#x27;, law practices and financial services providers. 

From 1982 to 1989, she worked as a freelance IT consultant. From 1989 to 1998, she was a Project Manager at Thames Water.

==Parliamentary career==
Doughty entered Parliament in the 2001 election, becoming the first non-Conservative MP returned for Guildford since 1906 and the constituency&#x27;s first ever female MP. In Parliament, she served as the Liberal Democrat Environment Spokesperson from 2001 to 2003, following on from her successful campaign opposing the construction of a large incinerator in Guildford. She was part of the front bench team from 2003 to 2005 and served on the Environmental Audit Select Committee throughout her time in Parliament. She was co-Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Waste Group (now the All Party Parliamentary Resource Group) and Secretary of the APPG for Renewable Energy.

She left in the 2005 general election, when she lost narrowly to the Conservative candidate Anne Milton. Doughty is a Quaker and upon her departure in 2005, left Parliament without any Quaker MPs for the first time in 150 years.

Doughty was re-selected as prospective parliamentary candidate for Guildford for the 2010 election, however she was again defeated by Milton. Between 2010 and 2016, she was a member of the Federal Executive Committee of the Liberal Democrats.

==Miscellaneous==
* Doughty joined the Liberal Party, the predecessors to the Liberal Democrats, in 1979 while living near Newbury.
* Membership of the Environmental Audit Select committee (2001–2005)
* Selected as PPC to fight the Guildford Constituency (1998)
* Hansard lists the alternative names: Sue Powell (1948–2005) Sue Orchard-Doughty (1948–2005).

==Personal life==
Doughty currently lives in Shalford, a suburb of Guildford. She was married to David Orchard (d. 2015) and she has two sons.

<text>In DOS memory management, expanded memory is a system of bank switching that provided additional memory to DOS programs beyond the limit of conventional memory (640 KiB).

&quot;Expanded memory&quot; is an umbrella term for several incompatible technology variants. The most widely used variant was the Expanded Memory Specification (EMS), which was developed jointly by Lotus Software, Intel, and Microsoft, so that this specification was sometimes referred to as &quot;LIM EMS&quot;. LIM EMS had three versions: 3.0, 3.2, and 4.0. The first widely implemented version was EMS 3.2, which supported up to 8 MiB of expanded memory and uses parts of the address space normally dedicated to communication with peripherals (upper memory) to map portions of the expanded memory. EEMS, an expanded-memory management standard competing with LIM EMS 3.x, was developed by AST Research, Quadram and Ashton-Tate (&quot;AQA&quot;); it could map any area of the lower 1 MiB. EEMS ultimately was incorporated in LIM EMS 4.0, which supported up to 32 MiB of expanded memory and provided some support for DOS multitasking as well. IBM, however, created its own expanded-memory standard called XMA.

The use of expanded memory became common with games and business programs such as Lotus 1-2-3 in the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, but its use declined as users switched from DOS to protected-mode operating systems such as Linux, IBM OS/2, and Microsoft Windows.

==Background==
The 8088 processor of the IBM PC and IBM PC/XT could address one megabyte (MiB, or 220 bytes) of memory. It inherited this limit from the 20-bit external address bus (and overall memory addressing architecture) of the Intel 8086. The designers of the PC allocated the lower 640 KiB ( bytes) of address space for read-write program memory (RAM), called &quot;conventional memory&quot;, and the remaining 384 KiB of memory space was reserved for uses such as the system BIOS, video memory, and memory on expansion peripheral boards.

Even though the IBM PC AT, introduced in 1984, used the 80286 chip that could address up to 16 MiB of RAM as extended memory, it could only do so in protected mode. The scarcity of software compatible with protected mode (no standard DOS applications could run in it) meant that the market was still open for another solution.

To make more memory accessible, a bank switching scheme was devised, where only selected parts of the additional memory would be accessible at any given time. Originally, a single 64 KiB (216 bytes) window of memory, called a page frame, was used; later this was made more flexible. Programs had to be written in a specific way to access expanded memory. The &quot;window&quot; between conventional memory and expanded memory could be adjusted to access different locations within the expanded memory.

A first attempt to use a bank switching technique was made by Tall Tree Systems with their JRAM boards, but these did not catch on. (Tall Tree Systems later made EMS-based boards using the same JRAM brand.)

==Expanded Memory Specification (EMS)==
Lotus Development, Intel, and Microsoft cooperated to develop the EMS standard (aka LIM EMS). The first publicly available version of EMS, version 3.0 allowed access of up to 4 MiB of expanded memory. This was increased to 8 MiB with version 3.2 of the specification. The final version of EMS, version 4.0 increased the maximum amount of expanded memory to 32 MiB and supported additional functionality.

Microsoft thought that bank switching was an inelegant and temporary, but necessary stopgap measure. Slamming his fist on the table during an interview Bill Gates said of expanded memory, &quot;It&#x27;s garbage! It&#x27;s a kludge! … But we&#x27;re going to do it&quot;. The companies planned to launch the standard at the Spring 1985 COMDEX, with many expansion-card and software companies announcing their support.

The first public version of the EMS standard, called EMS 3.0 was released in 1985; EMS 3.0, however, saw almost no hardware implementations before being superseded by EMS 3.2. EMS 3.2 used a 64 KiB region in the upper 384 KiB (upper memory area) divided into four 16 KiB pages, which could be used to map portions of the expanded memory.

In turn, EMS 3.2 was improved upon by a group of three other companies: AST Research, Quadram and Ashton-Tate, which created their own Enhanced EMS (EEMS) standard. EEMS allowed any 16 KiB region in lower RAM to be mapped to expanded memory, as long as it was not associated with interrupts or dedicated I/O memory such as network or video cards. Thus, entire programs could be switched in and out of the extra RAM. EEMS also added support for two sets of mapping registers. These features were used by early DOS multitasker software such as DESQview. Released in 1987, the LIM EMS 4.0 specification incorporated practically all features of EEMS.

A new feature added in LIM EMS 4.0 was that EMS boards could have multiple sets of page-mapping registers (up to 64 sets). This allowed a primitive form of DOS multitasking. The caveat was, however, that the standard did not specify how many register sets a board should have, so there was great variability between hardware implementations in this respect.

The Expanded Memory Specification (EMS) is the specification describing the use of expanded memory. EMS functions are accessible through software interrupt 67h. Programs using EMS must first establish the presence of an installed expanded memory manager (EMM) by checking for a device driver with the device name EMMXXXX0.

==Expanded Memory Adapter (XMA)==
IBM developed their own memory standard called Expanded Memory Adapter (XMA); the IBM DOS driver for it was XMAEM.SYS. Unlike EMS, the IBM expansion boards could be addressed both using an expanded memory model and as extended memory. The expanded memory hardware interface used by XMA boards is, however, incompatible with EMS, but a XMA2EMS.SYS driver provided EMS emulation for XMA boards. XMA boards were first introduced for the 1986 (revamped) models of the 3270 PC.

==Implementations==
===Expansion boards===

This insertion of a memory window into the peripheral address space could originally be accomplished only through specific expansion boards, plugged into the ISA expansion bus of the computer. Famous 1980s expanded memory boards were AST RAMpage, IBM PS/2 80286 Memory Expansion Option, AT&amp;T Expanded Memory Adapter and the Intel Above Board. Given the price of RAM during the period, up to several hundred dollars per MiB, and the quality and reputation of the above brand names, an expanded memory board was very expensive.

===Motherboard chipsets===
Later, some motherboard chipsets of Intel 80286-based computers implemented an expanded memory scheme that did not require add-on boards, notably the NEAT chipset. Typically, software switches determined how much memory should be used as &quot;expanded memory&quot; and how much should be used as &quot;extended memory&quot;.

===Device drivers===
An expanded-memory board, being a hardware peripheral, needed a software device driver, which exported its services. Such a device driver was called expanded-memory manager. Its name was variable; the previously mentioned boards used REMM.SYS (AST), PS2EMM.SYS (IBM), AEMM.SYS (AT&amp;T) and EMM.SYS (Intel) respectively. Later, the expression became associated with software-only solutions requiring the Intel 80386 processor, for example Quarterdeck&#x27;s QEMM, Qualitas&#x27; 386MAX or the default EMM386 in MS-DOS, PC DOS and DR-DOS.

=== Software emulation ===
Beginning in 1986, the built-in memory management features of Intel 80386 processor freely modeled the address space when running legacy real-mode software, making hardware solutions unnecessary. Expanded memory could be simulated in software.

The first software expanded-memory &quot;management&quot; (emulation) program was CEMM, available in September 1986 as a utility for the Compaq Deskpro 386. A popular and well-featured commercial solution was Quarterdeck&#x27;s QEMM. A contender was Qualitas&#x27; 386MAX. Functionality was later incorporated into MS-DOS 4.01 in 1989 and into DR DOS 5.0 in 1990, as EMM386.

Software expanded-memory managers in general offered additional, but closely related functionality. Notably, they allowed using parts of the upper memory area (UMA) (the upper 384 KiB of real-mode address space) called &quot;upper memory blocks&quot; (UMBs) and provided tools for loading small programs, typically terminate-and-stay-resident programs inside (&quot;LOADHI&quot; or &quot;LOADHIGH&quot;).

Interaction between extended memory, expanded-memory emulation and DOS extenders ended up being regulated by the XMS, Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI), DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) and DOS Protected Mode Services (DPMS) specifications.

Certain emulation programs, colloquially known as LIMulators, did not rely on motherboard or 80386 features at all. Instead, they reserved 64 KiB of the base RAM for the expanded memory window, where they copied data to and from either extended memory or the hard disk when application programs requested page switches. This was programmatically easy to implement, but performance was low. This technique was offered by AboveDisk from Above Software and by several shareware programs.

It is also possible to emulate EMS by using XMS memory on 286 CPUs using 3rd party utilities like EMM286 (.SYS driver).

==Decline==
Expanded Memory usage declined in the 1990s. The IBM AT Intel 80286 supported 24 bits of address space (16 MiB) in protected mode, and the 386 supported 32-bit addresses, or 4 gigabytes (232) of RAM – 4096 times the addressable space of the original 8086. DOS itself did not directly support protected mode, but Microsoft eventually developed DPMI, and several DOS extenders were published based on it. DOS programs like &quot;Doom&quot; could use extenders like DOS/4G to run in protected mode while still using the DOS API. In the early 1990s new operating systems like Linux, Windows 9x, Windows NT, OS/2, and BSD/OS supported protected mode &quot;out of the box&quot;. These and similar developments rendered Expanded Memory an obsolete concept.

==Similar concepts==
Other platforms have implemented the same basic concept – additional memory outside of the main address space – but in technically incompatible ways:
*Expanded storage was a feature on IBM mainframes providing additional memory outside of the main system memory, first introduced with the IBM 3090 high-end mainframe series in 1985. Expanded storage could not be directly addressed by applications; an MVS feature known as &quot;window services&quot; enabled applications to allocate movable windows to expanded storage within their own address space. There was also a &quot;data mover&quot; feature which could be invoked to move data between main memory (central storage) and expanded storage; later, an &quot;Asynchronous Data Mover Facility&quot; (ADMF) was introduced, which enabled applications to request data to be moved between the two in the background, while they performed other processing. By the mid-1990s, expanded storage had ceased to be a physically separate memory, and had become merely a logical division within the system memory enforced by firmware; but it was not until the November 2016 release of z/VM 6.4 that IBM finally removed all support for expanded storage from its mainframe operating systems.
*Address Windowing Extensions (AWE) is a conceptually similar feature in Microsoft Windows, used to enable 32-bit applications to access more memory than the 2–4GB that can fit in a 32-bit address space. Although still supported by current versions of Windows, its use has been superseded by 64-bit applications, which can access &gt;4GB of memory directly.
*Virtual memory creates the illusion of available memory using, for instance, disk storage.

<text>In DOS memory management, conventional memory, also called base memory, is the first 640 kilobytes of the memory on IBM PC or compatible systems. It is the read-write memory directly addressable by the processor for use by the operating system and application programs. As memory prices rapidly declined, this design decision became a limitation in the use of large memory capacities until the introduction of operating systems and processors that made it irrelevant.

== 640 KB barrier ==
The 640 KB barrier is an architectural limitation of IBM PC compatible PCs. The Intel 8088 CPU, used in the original IBM PC, was able to address 1 MB (220 bytes), since the chip offered 20 address lines. In the design of the PC, the memory below 640 KB was for random-access memory on the motherboard or on expansion boards, and it was called the conventional memory area. The first memory segment (64 KB) of the conventional memory area is named lower memory or low memory area. The remaining 384 KB beyond the conventional memory area, called the upper memory area (UMA), was reserved for system use and optional devices. UMA was used for the ROM BIOS, additional read-only memory, BIOS extensions for fixed disk drives and video adapters, video adapter memory, and other memory-mapped input and output devices. The design of the original IBM PC placed the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) memory map in UMA.

The need for more RAM grew faster than the needs of hardware to utilize the reserved addresses, which resulted in RAM eventually being mapped into these unused upper areas to utilize all available addressable space. This introduced a reserved &quot;hole&quot; (or several holes) into the set of addresses occupied by hardware that could be used for arbitrary data. Avoiding such a hole was difficult and ugly and not supported by DOS or most programs that could run on it. Later, space between the holes would be used as upper memory blocks (UMBs).

To maintain compatibility with older operating systems and applications, the 640 KB barrier remained part of the PC design even after the 8086/8088 had been replaced with the Intel 80286 processor, which could address up to 16 MB of memory in protected mode. The 1 MB barrier also remained as long as the 286 was running in real mode, since DOS required real mode which uses the segment and offset registers in an overlapped manner such that addresses with more than 20 bits are not possible. It is still present in IBM PC compatibles today if they are running in real mode such as used by DOS. Even the most modern Intel PCs still have the area between 640 and 1024 KB reserved. This however is invisible to programs (or even most of the operating system) on newer operating systems (such as Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X) that use virtual memory, because they have no awareness of physical memory addresses at all. Instead they operate within a virtual address space, which is defined independently of available RAM addresses.

Some motherboards feature a &quot;Memory Hole at 15 Megabytes&quot; option required for certain VGA video cards that require exclusive access to one particular megabyte for video memory. Later video cards using the AGP (PCI memory space) bus can have 256 MB memory with 1 GB aperture size.

=== Additional memory ===
One technique used on early IBM XT computers was to install additional RAM into the video memory address range and push the limit up to the start of the Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA). Sometimes software or a custom address decoder was required for this to work. This moved the barrier to 704 KB (with MDA/HGC) or 736 KB (with CGA).

Memory managers on 386-based systems (such as QEMM or MEMMAX (+V) in DR-DOS) could achieve the same effect, adding conventional memory at 640 KB and moving the barrier to 704 KB (up to segment B000, the start of MDA/HGC) or 736 KB (up to segment B800, the start of the CGA). Only CGA could be used in this situation, because Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) video memory was immediately adjacent to the conventional memory area below the 640 KB line; the same memory area could not be used both for the frame buffer of the video card and for transient programs.

All Computers&#x27; piggy-back add-on memory management units &quot;AllCard&quot; for XT- and &quot;Chargecard&quot; for 286/386SX-class computers, as well as MicroWay&#x27;s ECM (Extended Conventional Memory) add-on-board allowed normal memory to be mapped into the A0000–EFFFF (hex) address range, giving up to 952 KB for DOS programs. Programs such as Lotus 1-2-3, which accessed video memory directly, needed to be patched to handle this memory layout. Therefore, the 640 KB barrier was removed at the cost of hardware compatibility.

It was also possible to use console redirection (either by specifying an alternative console device like when initially invoking COMMAND.COM or by using CTTY later on) to direct output to and receive input from a dumb terminal or another computer running a terminal emulator. Assuming the System BIOS still permitted the machine to boot (which is often the case at least with BIOSes for embedded PCs), the video card in a so called headless computer could then be removed completely, and the system could provide a total of 960 KB of continuous DOS memory for programs to load.

Similar usage was possible on many DOS- but not IBM-compatible computers with a non-fragmented memory layout, for example SCP S-100 bus systems equipped with their 8086 CPU card CP-200B and up to sixteen SCP 110A memory cards (with 64 KB RAM on each of them) for a total of up to 1024 KB (without video card, but utilizing console redirection, and after mapping out the boot/BIOS ROM), the Victor 9000/Sirius 1 which supported up to 896 KB, or the Apricot PC with more continuous DOS memory to be used under its custom version of MS-DOS.

== DOS driver software and TSRs ==
Most standard programs written for DOS did not necessarily need 640 KB or more of memory. Instead, driver software and utilities referred to as terminate-and-stay-resident programs (TSRs) could be used in addition to the standard DOS software. These drivers and utilities typically used some conventional memory permanently, reducing the total available for standard DOS programs.

Some very common DOS drivers and TSRs using conventional memory included:
* ANSI.SYS - support for color text and different text resolutions
* ASPIxDOS.SYS, ASPIDISK.SYS, ASPICD.SYS - all must be loaded for Adaptec SCSI drives and CDROMs to work
* DOSKEY.EXE - permits recall of previously typed DOS commands using up-arrow
* LSL.EXE, E100BODI.EXE (or other network driver), IPXODI.EXE, NETX.EXE - all must be loaded for NetWare file server drive letter access
* MOUSE.EXE - support for mouse devices in DOS programs
* MSCDEX.EXE - support for CDROM drive access and drive letter, used in combination with a separate manufacturer-specific driver. Needed in addition to above SCSI drivers for access to a SCSI CDROM device.
* SBCONFIG.EXE - support for Sound Blaster 16 audio device; a differently-named driver was used for various other sound cards, also occupying conventional memory.
* SMARTDRV.EXE - install drive cache to speed up disk reads and writes; although it could allocate several megabytes of memory beyond 640 KB for the drive caching, it still needed a small portion of conventional memory to function.

As can be seen above, many of these drivers and TSRs could be considered practically essential to the full-featured operation of the system. But in many cases a choice had to be made by the computer user, to decide whether to be able to run certain standard DOS programs or have all their favorite drivers and TSRs loaded. Loading the entire list shown above is likely either impractical or impossible, if the user also wants to run a standard DOS program as well.

In some cases drivers or TSRs would have to be unloaded from memory to run certain programs, and then reloaded after running the program. For drivers that could not be unloaded, later versions of DOS included a startup menu capability to allow the computer user to select various groups of drivers and TSRs to load before running certain high-memory-usage standard DOS programs.

=== Upper memory blocks and loading high ===
As DOS applications grew larger and more complex in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it became common practice to free up conventional memory by moving the device drivers and TSR programs into upper memory blocks (UMBs) in the upper memory area (UMA) at boot, in order to maximize the conventional memory available for applications. This had the advantage of not requiring hardware changes, and preserved application compatibility.

This feature was first provided by third-party products such as QEMM, before being built into DR DOS 5.0 in 1990 then MS-DOS 5.0 in 1991. Most users used the accompanying driver provided in MS-DOS 5, but third-party products from companies such as QEMM also proved popular.

At startup, drivers could be loaded high using the &quot;DEVICEHIGH=&quot; directive, while TSRs could be loaded high using the &quot;LOADHIGH&quot;, &quot;LH&quot; or &quot;HILOAD&quot; directives. If the operation failed, the driver or TSR would automatically load into the regular conventional memory instead.

CONFIG.SYS, loading ANSI.SYS into UMBs, no EMS support enabled:
 DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
 DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE NOEMS
 DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS

AUTOEXEC.BAT, loading MOUSE, DOSKEY, and SMARTDRV into UMBs if possible:
 LH C:\DOS\MOUSE.EXE
 LH C:\DOS\DOSKEY.EXE
 LH C:\DOS\SMARTDRV.EXE

The ability of DOS versions 5.0 and later to move their own system core code into the high memory area (HMA) through the DOS=HIGH command gave another boost to free memory.

=== Driver and TSR optimization ===
Hardware expansion boards could use any of the upper memory area for ROM addressing, so the upper memory blocks were of variable size and in different locations for each computer, depending on the hardware installed. Some windows of upper memory could be large and others small. Loading drivers and TSRs high would pick a block and try to fit the program into it, until a block was found where it fit, or it would go into conventional memory.

An unusual aspect of drivers and TSRs is that they would use different amounts of conventional and/or upper memory, based on the order they were loaded. This could be used to advantage if the programs were repeatedly loaded in different orders, and checking to see how much memory was free after each permutation. For example, if there was a 50 KB UMB and a 10 KB UMB, and programs needing 8 KB and 45 KB were loaded, the 8 KB might go into the 50 KB UMB, preventing the second from loading. Later versions of DOS allowed the use of a specific load address for a driver or TSR, to fit drivers/TSRs more tightly together.

In MS-DOS 6.0, Microsoft introduced codice_1, which automated this process of block matching, matching the functionality third-party memory managers offered. This automatic optimization often still did not provide the same result as doing it by hand, in the sense of providing the greatest free conventional memory.

Also in some cases third-party companies wrote special multi-function drivers that would combine the capabilities of several standard DOS drivers and TSRs into a single very compact program that used just a few kilobytes of memory. For example, the functions of mouse driver, CD-ROM driver, ANSI support, DOSKEY command recall, and disk caching would all be combined together in one program, consuming just 1 – 2 kilobytes of conventional memory for normal driver/interrupt access, and storing the rest of the multi-function program code in EMS or XMS memory.

== DOS extenders ==

The barrier was only overcome with the arrival of DOS extenders, which allowed DOS applications to run in 16-bit or 32-bit protected mode, but these were not very widely used outside of computer gaming. With a 32-bit DOS extender, a game could benefit from a 32-bit flat address space and the full 32-bit instruction set without the 66h/67h operand/address override prefixes. 32-bit DOS extenders required compiler support (32-bit compilers) while XMS and EMS worked with an old compiler targeting 16-bit real-mode DOS applications. The two most common specifications for DOS extenders were VCPI- and later DPMI-compatible with Windows 3.x.

The most notable DPMI-compliant DOS extender may be DOS/4GW, shipping with Watcom. It was very common in games for DOS. Such a game would consist of either a DOS/4GW 32-bit kernel, or a stub which loaded a DOS/4GW kernel located in the path or in the same directory and a 32-bit &quot;linear executable&quot;. Utilities are available which can strip DOS/4GW out of such a program and allow the user to experiment with any of the several, and perhaps improved, DOS/4GW clones.

Prior to DOS extenders, if a user installed additional memory and wished to use it under DOS, they would first have to install and configure drivers to support either expanded memory specification (EMS) or extended memory specification (XMS) and run programs supporting one of these specifications.

EMS was a specification available on all PCs, including those based on the Intel 8086 and Intel 8088, which allowed add-on hardware to page small chunks of memory in and out (bank switching) of the &quot;real mode&quot; addressing space (0x0400–0xFFFF). This allowed 16-bit real-mode DOS programs to access several megabytes of RAM through a hole in real memory, typically (0xE000–0xEFFF). A program would then have to explicitly request the page to be accessed before using it. These memory locations could then be used arbitrarily until replaced by another page. This is very similar to modern paged virtual memory. However, in a virtual memory system, the operating system handles all paging operations, while paging was explicit with EMS.

XMS provided a basic protocol which allowed a 16-bit DOS programs to load chunks of 80286 or 80386 extended memory in low memory (address 0x0400–0xFFFF). A typical XMS driver had to switch to protected mode in order to load this memory. The problem with this approach is that while in 286 protected mode, direct DOS calls could not be made. The workaround was to implement a callback mechanism, requiring a reset of the 286. On the 286, this was a major problem. The Intel 80386, which introduced &quot;virtual 8086 mode&quot;, allowed the guest kernel to emulate the 8086 and run the host operating system without having to actually force the processor back into &quot;real mode&quot;. HIMEM.SYS 2.03 and higher used unreal mode on the 80386 and higher CPUs while HIMEM.SYS 2.06 and higher used LOADALL to change undocumented internal registers on the 80286, significantly improving interrupt latency by avoiding repeated real mode/protected mode switches.

Windows installs its own version of HIMEM.SYS on DOS 3.3 and higher. Windows HIMEM.SYS launches 32-bit protected mode XMS (n).0 services provider for the Windows Virtual Machine Manager, which then provides XMS (n-1).0 services to DOS boxes and the 16-bit Windows machine (e.g. DOS 7 HIMEM.SYS is XMS 3.0 but running &#x27;MEM&#x27; command in a Windows 95 DOS window shows XMS 2.0 information).

<text>David Elliott Drew (born 13 April 1952) is a British politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Stroud from 1997 to 2010 and 2017 to 2019. A member of the Labour and Co-operative parties, he was Shadow Minister for Farming and Rural Affairs from 2017 to 2019.

==Early life and career==

Drew was born in Gloucestershire, the son of an accountant, and educated at Kingsfield School, Kingswood. He was awarded a Bachelor of Arts in economics at the University of Nottingham in 1974, and qualified as a teacher after receiving his Postgraduate Certificate in Education from the University of Birmingham in 1976. Drew gained a Master of Arts in historical studies from Bristol Polytechnic in 1988, and was awarded a Master of Education from the University of the West of England in 1994.

Drew began his teaching career at Princethorpe College, Rugby in 1976 and moved to St Michael&#x27;s School, Stevenage in 1978. He returned to Gloucestershire in 1982, teaching at Maidenhill School, Stonehouse, before working at Dene Magna Community School, Mitcheldean. Drew was a member of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers throughout his teaching career, serving as a branch secretary from 1984 to 1986. He became a senior lecturer in education at the University of West England in 1986, where he worked until his election to Parliament. Drew remains a member of the University and College Union and has been a member of UNISON since 1990.

==Political career==

Drew briefly served on Stevenage Borough Council for a year in 1981. He was a Member of Stroud District Council from 1987 to 1995 and Gloucestershire County Council from 1992 to 1997. He was also elected to Stonehouse Town Council in 1987 and served as Stroud Constituency Labour Party secretary in 1992.

Drew unsuccessfully contested Stroud at the 1992 general election, but defeated incumbent Conservative Roger Knapman at the 1997 general election. He increased his majority in 2001 and narrowly held the seat with a majority of 350 votes in 2005. Drew was defeated by Conservative Neil Carmichael at the 2010 general election.
Drew made his maiden speech on 17 June 1997. He was a member of the Agriculture Committee, later the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, from 1999 to 2010.

Drew returned to Stroud District Council at the 2011 local elections, elected to represent Farmhill and Paganhill ward. He unsuccessfully contested Stroud once again in 2015, but won the seat from Carmichael at the 2017 general election with a majority of 687 votes. Shortly after re-election, he was appointed to his first front bench role in July 2017, as Shadow Minister for Farming and Rural Affairs.

He lost his seat to Conservative Siobhan Baillie at the 2019 general election, when he also faced a challenge from Green Party candidate Molly Scott Cato. Drew defeated Scott Cato to win a seat on Gloucestershire County Council in 2021, and narrowly missed-out on election to Stroud District Council.

== Political views ==
A member of the Socialist Campaign Group, Drew was considered a backbench rebel having voted against the Iraq War and government anti-terror legislation. He nominated John McDonnell in the 2007 Labour leadership election.

Drew has been a staunch Eurosceptic, and welcomed an endorsement by Stroud&#x27;s UKIP candidate at the 2010 general election. However, Drew gave a speech against Prime Minister Theresa May&#x27;s deal to leave the EU in 2019, saying he feared Brexit would &quot;become one of the biggest domestic policy disasters this country has known.&quot;

==Personal life==
Drew married second wife Anne Baker in 1990, and has two daughters and two sons. He resides in Stonehouse, Gloucestershire and is a vegetarian.

He was appointed Chairman of Forest Green Rovers F.C. in May 2010, and later became Vice-Chairman. Drew resigned his role upon re-election to Parliament in 2017.

<doc id="420223" wikidata="Q16995363" url="?curid=420223" title="High memory area">
<text>In DOS memory management, the high memory area (HMA) is the RAM area consisting of the first 65520 bytes above the one megabyte in an IBM AT or compatible computer.

In real mode, the segmentation architecture of the Intel 8086 and subsequent processors identifies memory locations with a 16-bit segment and a 16-bit offset, which is resolved into a physical address via (segment) × 16 + (offset). Although intended to address only 1 Megabyte (MB) (220 bytes) of memory, segment:offset addresses at codice_1 and beyond reference memory beyond 1 MB (codice_2). So, on an 80286 and subsequent processors, this mode can actually address the first 65520 bytes of extended memory as part of the 64 KB range starting 16 bytes before the 1 MB mark—codice_3 to codice_4. The Intel 8086 and 8088 processors, with only 1 MB of memory and only 20 address lines, wrapped around at the 20th bit, so that address codice_1 was equivalent to codice_6.

To allow running existing DOS programs which relied on this feature to access low memory on their newer IBM PC AT computers, IBM added special circuitry on the motherboard to simulate the wrapping around. This circuit was a simple logic gate which could disconnect the microprocessor&#x27;s 21st addressing line, A20, from the rest of the motherboard. This gate could be controlled, initially through the keyboard controller, to allow running programs which wanted to access the entire RAM.

So-called A20 handlers could control the addressing mode dynamically, thereby allowing programs to load themselves into the 1024–1088 KB region and run in real mode.

Code suitable to be executed in the HMA must either be coded to be position-independent (using only relative references), be compiled to work at the specific addresses in the HMA (typically allowing only one or at most two pieces of code to share the HMA), or it must be designed to be paragraph boundary or even offset relocatable (with all addresses being fixed up during load).

Before code (or data) in the HMA can be addressed by the CPU, the corresponding driver must ensure that the HMA is mapped in. This requires that any such requests are tunneled through a stub remaining in memory outside the HMA, which would invoke the A20 handler in order to (temporarily) enable the A20 gate. If the driver does not exhibit any public data structures and only uses interrupts or calls already controlled by the underlying operating system, it might be possible to register the driver with the system in a way so that the system will take care of A20 itself thereby eliminating the need for a separate stub.

The first user of the HMA among Microsoft products was Windows/286 2.1 in 1988, which introduced the HIMEM.SYS device driver. Starting in 1990 with Digital Research&#x27;s DR DOS 5.0 (via HIDOS.SYS /BDOS=FFFF and CONFIG.SYS HIDOS=ON) and since 1991 with MS-DOS 5.0 (via DOS=HIGH), parts of the operating system&#x27;s BIOS and kernel could be loaded into the HMA as well, freeing up to 46 KB of conventional memory. Other components, such as device drivers and terminate-and-stay-resident programs (TSRs), could at least be loaded into the upper memory area (UMA), but not into the HMA. Under DOS 5.0 and higher, with DOS=HIGH, the system additionally attempted to move the disk buffers into the HMA. Under DR DOS 6.0 (1991) and higher, the disk buffers (via HIBUFFERS, and later also BUFFERSHIGH), parts of the command processor COMMAND.COM as well as several special self-relocating drivers like KEYB, NLSFUNC and SHARE could load into the HMA as well (using their /MH option), thereby freeing up even more conventional memory and upper memory for conventional DOS software to work with. TASKMAX seems to have relocated parts of itself into the HMA as well. Novell&#x27;s NLCACHE from NetWare Lite and early versions of NWCACHE from Personal NetWare and Novell DOS 7 could utilize the HMA as well. Under MS-DOS/PC DOS, a ca. 2 KB shared portion of COMMAND.COM can be relocated into the HMA, as well as DISPLAY.SYS bitmaps for prepared codepages. Under MS-DOS 6.2 (1993) and higher, a ca. 5 KB portion of DBLSPACE.BIN/DRVSPACE.BIN can coexist with DOS in the HMA (unless DBLSPACE/DRVSPACE /NOHMA is invoked). Under PC DOS 7.0 (1995) and 2000, DOSKEY loads into the HMA (if available), and SHARE can be loaded into the HMA as well (unless its /NOHMA option is given). Under MS-DOS 7.0 (1995) to 8.0 (2000), parts of the HMA are also used as a scratchpad to hold a growing data structure recording various properties of the loaded real-mode drivers.

<doc id="420224" wikidata="Q318623" url="?curid=420224" title="Myofibril">
<text>A myofibril (also known as a muscle fibril or sarcostyle) is a basic rod-like organelle of a muscle cell. Skeletal muscles are composed of long, tubular cells known as muscle fibers, and these cells contain many chains of myofibrils. Each myofibril has a diameter of 1–2 micrometres. They are created during embryonic development in a process known as myogenesis.

Myofibrils are composed of long proteins including actin, myosin, and titin, and other proteins that hold them together. These proteins are organized into thick, thin, and elastic myofilaments, which repeat along the length of the myofibril in sections or units of contraction called sarcomeres. Muscles contract by sliding the thick myosin, and thin actin myofilaments along each other.

==Structure==

Each myofibril has a diameter of between 1 and 2 micrometres (μm). The filaments of myofibrils, myofilaments, consist of three types, thick, thin, and elastic filaments.
*Thin filaments consist primarily of the protein actin, coiled with nebulin filaments. Actin, when polymerized into filaments, forms the &quot;ladder&quot; along which the myosin filaments &quot;climb&quot; to generate motion
*Thick filaments consist primarily of the protein myosin, that is responsible for force generation. It is composed of a globular head with both ATP and actin binding sites, and a long tail involved in its polymerization into myosin filaments.
*Elastic filaments are made up of a giant protein called titin and hold the thick filaments in place.

The protein complex composed of actin and myosin is sometimes referred to as actomyosin.

In striated skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue the actin and myosin filaments each have a specific and constant length on the order of a few micrometers, far less than the length of the elongated muscle cell (a few millimeters in the case of human skeletal muscle cells). The filaments are organized into repeated subunits along the length of the myofibril. These subunits are called sarcomeres that are around three μm in length. The muscle cell is nearly filled with myofibrils running parallel to each other on the long axis of the cell. The sarcomeric subunits of one myofibril are in nearly perfect alignment with those of the myofibrils next to it. This alignment gives the cell its striped or striated appearance. Exposed muscle cells at certain angles, such as in meat cuts, can show structural coloration or iridescence due to this periodic alignment of the fibrils and sarcomeres.

===Appearance===

The names of the various sub-regions of the sarcomere are based on their relatively lighter or darker appearance when viewed through the light microscope. Each sarcomere is delimited by two very dark colored bands called Z-discs or Z-lines (from the German &quot;zwischen&quot; meaning between). These Z-discs are dense protein discs that do not easily allow the passage of light. The T-tubule is present in this area. The area between the Z-discs is further divided into two lighter colored bands at either end called the I-bands or Isotropic Bands, and a darker, grayish band in the middle called the A band or Anisotropic Bands.

The I bands appear lighter because these regions of the sarcomere mainly contain the thin actin filaments, whose smaller diameter allows the passage of light between them. The A band, on the other hand, contains mostly myosin filaments whose larger diameter restricts the passage of light. A stands for anisotropic and I for isotropic, referring to the optical properties of living muscle as demonstrated with polarized light microscopy.

The parts of the A band that abut the I bands are occupied by both actin and myosin filaments (where they interdigitate as described above). Also within the A band is a relatively brighter central region called the H-zone (from the German &quot;helle&quot;, meaning bright) in which there is no actin/myosin overlap when the muscle is in a relaxed state. Finally, the H-zone is bisected by a dark central line called the M-line (from the German &quot;mittel&quot; meaning middle).

==Development==
A study of the developing leg muscle in a 12-day chick embryo using electron microscopy proposes a mechanism for the development of myofibrils. Developing muscle cells contain thick (myosin) filaments that are 160–170 Å in diameter and thin (actin)filaments that are 60–70 Å in diameter. Young myofibres contain a 7:1 ratio of thin to thick filaments. Along the long axis of the muscle cells in subsarcolemmal locations, free myofilaments become aligned and aggregate into hexagonally packed arrays. These aggregates form regardless of the presence of Z band or M band material. Aggregation occurs spontaneously because the tertiary structures of actin and myosin monomers contain all the &quot;information&quot; with the ionic strength and ATP concentration of the cell to aggregate into the filaments.

==Function==
The myosin heads form cross bridges with the actin myofilaments; this is where they carry out a &#x27;rowing&#x27; action along the actin. When the muscle fibre is relaxed (before contraction), the myosin head has ADP and phosphate bound to it.

When a nerve impulse arrives, Ca2+ ions cause troponin to change shape; this moves the troponin + tropomyosin complex away, leaving the myosin binding sites open.

The myosin head now binds to the actin myofilament. Energy in the head of the myosin myofilament moves the head, which slides the actin past; hence ADP is released.

ATP presents itself (as the presence of the calcium ions activates the myosin&#x27;s ATPase), and the myosin heads disconnect from the actin to grab the ATP. The ATP is then broken down into ADP and phosphate. Energy is released and stored in the myosin head to utilize for later movement. The myosin heads now return to their upright relaxed position. If calcium is present, the process is repeated.

When a muscle contracts, the actin is pulled along myosin toward the center of the sarcomere until the actin and myosin filaments are completely overlapped. The H zone becomes smaller and smaller due to the increasing overlap of actin and myosin filaments, and the muscle shortens. Thus when the muscle is fully contracted, the H zone is no longer visible. Note that the actin and myosin filaments themselves do not change length, but instead slide past each other. This is known as the sliding filament theory of muscle contraction.

<text>A sarcomere (Greek σάρξ &quot;sarx&quot; &quot;flesh&quot;, μέρος &quot;meros&quot; &quot;part&quot;) is the smallest functional unit of striated muscle tissue. It is the repeating unit between two Z-lines. Skeletal muscles are composed of tubular muscle cells (called muscle fibers or myofibers) which are formed during embryonic myogenesis. Muscle fibers contain numerous tubular myofibrils. Myofibrils are composed of repeating sections of sarcomeres, which appear under the microscope as alternating dark and light bands. Sarcomeres are composed of long, fibrous proteins as filaments that slide past each other when a muscle contracts or relaxes. The costamere is a different component that connects the sarcomere to the sarcolemma.

Two of the important proteins are myosin, which forms the thick filament, and actin, which forms the thin filament. Myosin has a long fibrous tail and a globular head that binds to actin. The myosin head also binds to ATP, which is the source of energy for muscle movement. Myosin can only bind to actin when the binding sites on actin are exposed by calcium ions.

Actin molecules are bound to the Z-line, which forms the borders of the sarcomere. Other bands appear when the sarcomere is relaxed.
The myofibrils of smooth muscle cells are not arranged into sarcomeres.

==Bands==
The sarcomeres give skeletal and cardiac muscle their striated appearance, which was first described by Van Leeuwenhoek.
* A sarcomere is defined as the segment between two neighbouring Z-lines (or Z-discs). In electron micrographs of cross-striated muscle, the Z-line (from the German &quot;zwischen&quot; meaning &quot;between&quot;) appears in between the I-bands as a dark line that anchors the actin myofilaments. 
* Surrounding the Z-line is the region of the I-band (for &quot;isotropic&quot;). I-band is the zone of thin filaments that is not superimposed by thick filaments (myosin).
* Following the I-band is the A-band (for &quot;anisotropic&quot;). Named for their properties under a polarized light microscope. An A-band contains the entire length of a single thick filament. The anisotropic band contains both thick and thin filaments. 
* Within the A-band is a paler region called the H-zone (from the German &quot;heller&quot;, &quot;brighter&quot;). Named for their lighter appearance under a polarization microscope. H-band is the zone of the thick filaments that has no actin.
* Within the H-zone is a thin M-line (from the German &quot;mittel&quot; &quot;meaning middle&quot;), appears in the middle of the sarcomere formed of cross-connecting elements of the cytoskeleton.

The relationship between the proteins and the regions of the sarcomere are as follows:
* &quot;Actin&quot; filaments, the thin filaments, are the major component of the I-band and extend into the A-band.
* &quot;Myosin&quot; filaments, the thick filaments, are bipolar and extend throughout the A-band. They are cross-linked at the centre by the M-band.
* The giant protein &quot;titin&quot; (connectin) extends from the Z-line of the sarcomere, where it binds to the thick filament (myosin) system, to the M-band, where it is thought to interact with the thick filaments. Titin (and its splice isoforms) is the biggest single highly elasticated protein found in nature. It provides binding sites for numerous proteins and is thought to play an important role as sarcomeric ruler and as blueprint for the assembly of the sarcomere.
* Another giant protein, nebulin, is hypothesised to extend along the thin filaments and the entire I-Band. Similar to titin, it is thought to act as a molecular ruler along for thin filament assembly.
* Several proteins important for the stability of the sarcomeric structure are found in the Z-line as well as in the M-band of the sarcomere.
* Actin filaments and titin molecules are cross-linked in the Z-disc via the Z-line protein alpha-actinin.
* The M-band proteins myomesin as well as C-protein crosslink the thick filament system (myosins) and the M-band part of titin (the elastic filaments).
*The M-line also binds creatine kinase, which facilitates the reaction of ADP and phosphocreatine into ATP and creatine.
* The interaction between actin and myosin filaments in the A-band of the sarcomere is responsible for the muscle contraction (based on the sliding filament model).

==Contraction==
The protein tropomyosin covers the myosin-binding sites of the actin molecules in the muscle cell. For a muscle cell to contract, tropomyosin must be moved to uncover the binding sites on the actin. Calcium ions bind with troponin C molecules (which are dispersed throughout the tropomyosin protein) and alter the structure of the tropomyosin, forcing it to reveal the cross-bridge binding site on the actin.

The concentration of calcium within muscle cells is controlled by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a unique form of endoplasmic reticulum in the sarcoplasm.

Muscle cells are stimulated when a motor neuron releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which travels across the neuromuscular junction (the synapse between the terminal button of the neuron and the muscle cell). Acetylcholine binds to a post-synaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. A change in the receptor conformation allows an influx of sodium ions and initiation of a post-synaptic action potential. The action potential then travels along T-tubules (transverse tubules) until it reaches the sarcoplasmic reticulum. 

Here, the depolarized membrane activates voltage-gated L-type calcium channels, present in the plasma membrane. The L-type calcium channels are in close association with ryanodine receptors present on the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The inward flow of calcium from the L-type calcium channels activates ryanodine receptors to release calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This mechanism is called calcium-induced calcium release (CICR). It is not understood whether the physical opening of the L-type calcium channels or the presence of calcium causes the ryanodine receptors to open. The outflow of calcium allows the myosin heads access to the actin cross-bridge binding sites, permitting muscle contraction.

Muscle contraction ends when calcium ions are pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, allowing the contractile apparatus and, thus, muscle cell to relax.

Upon muscle contraction, the A-bands do not change their length (1.85 micrometer in mammalian skeletal muscle), whereas the I-bands and the H-zone shorten. This causes the Z-lines to come closer together.

==Rest==
At rest, the myosin head is bound to an ATP molecule in a low-energy configuration and is unable to access the cross-bridge binding sites on the actin. However, the myosin head can hydrolyze ATP into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and an inorganic phosphate ion. A portion of the energy released in this reaction changes the shape of the myosin head and promotes it to a high-energy configuration. Through the process of binding to the actin, the myosin head releases ADP and an inorganic phosphate ion, changing its configuration back to one of low energy. The myosin remains attached to actin in a state known as &quot;rigor&quot;, until a new ATP binds the myosin head. This binding of ATP to myosin releases the actin by cross-bridge dissociation. The ATP-associated myosin is ready for another cycle, beginning with hydrolysis of the ATP.

The A-band is visible as dark transverse lines across myofibers; the I-band is visible as lightly staining transverse lines, and the Z-line is visible as dark lines separating sarcomeres at the light-microscope level.

==Energy Storage==
Most muscle cells can only store enough ATP for a small number of muscle contractions. While muscle cells also store glycogen, most of the energy required for contraction is derived from phosphagens. One such phosphagen, creatine phosphate, is used to provide ADP with a phosphate group for ATP synthesis in vertebrates.

==Comparative structure==
The structure of the sarcomere affects its function in several ways. The overlap of actin and myosin gives rise to the length-tension curve, which shows how sarcomere force output decreases if the muscle is stretched so that fewer cross-bridges can form or compressed until actin filaments interfere with each other. Length of the actin and myosin filaments (taken together as sarcomere length) affects force and velocity – longer sarcomeres have more cross-bridges and thus more force, but have a reduced range of shortening. Vertebrates display a very limited range of sarcomere lengths, with roughly the same optimal length (length at peak length-tension) in all muscles of an individual as well as between species. Arthropods, however, show tremendous variation (over seven-fold) in sarcomere length, both between species and between muscles in a single individual. The reasons for the lack of substantial sarcomere variability in vertebrates is not fully known.

<text>In optical engineering, an objective is an optical element that gathers light from an object being observed and focuses the light rays from it to produce a real image of the object. Objectives can be a single lens or mirror, or combinations of several optical elements. They are used in microscopes, binoculars, telescopes, cameras, slide projectors, CD players and many other optical instruments. Objectives are also called object lenses, object glasses, or objective glasses.

==Microscope objectives==

The objective lens of a microscope is the one at the bottom near the sample. At its simplest, it is a very high-powered magnifying glass, with very short focal length. This is brought very close to the specimen being examined so that the light from the specimen comes to a focus inside the microscope tube. The objective itself is usually a cylinder containing one or more lenses that are typically made of glass; its function is to collect light from the sample.

===Magnification===
One of the most important properties of microscope objectives is their magnification. The magnification typically ranges from 4× to 100×. It is combined with the magnification of the eyepiece to determine the overall magnification of the microscope; a 4× objective with a 10× eyepiece produces an image that is 40 times the size of the object.

A typical microscope has three or four objective lenses with different magnifications, screwed into a circular &quot;nosepiece&quot; which may be rotated to select the required lens. These lenses are often color coded for easier use. The least powerful lens is called the &quot;scanning objective lens&quot;, and is typically a 4× objective. The second lens is referred to as the &quot;small objective lens&quot; and is typically a 10× lens. The most powerful lens out of the three is referred to as the &quot;large objective lens&quot; and is typically 40–100×.

===Numerical aperture===
Numerical aperture for microscope lenses typically ranges from 0.10 to 1.25, corresponding to focal lengths of about 40 mm to 2 mm, respectively.

===Mechanical tube length===
Historically, microscopes were nearly universally designed with a finite mechanical tube length, which is the distance the light traveled in the microscope from the objective to the eyepiece. The Royal Microscopical Society standard is 160 millimeters, whereas Leitz often used 170 millimeters. 180 millimeter tube length objectives are also fairly common. Using an objective and microscope that were designed for different tube lengths will result in spherical aberration.

Instead of finite tube lengths, modern microscopes are often designed to use infinity correction instead, a technique in microscopy whereby the light coming out of the objective lens is focused at infinity. This is denoted on the objective with the infinity symbol (∞).

===Cover thickness===
Particularly in biological applications, samples are usually observed under a glass cover slip, which introduces distortions to the image. Objectives which are designed to be used with such cover slips will correct for these distortions, and typically have the thickness of the cover slip they are designed to work with written on the side of the objective (typically 0.17 mm).

In contrast, so called &quot;metallurgical&quot; objectives are designed for reflected light and do not use glass cover slips.

The distinction between objectives designed for use with or without cover slides is important for high numerical aperture (high magnification) lenses, but makes little difference for low magnification objectives.

===Lens design===
Basic glass lenses will typically result in significant and unacceptable chromatic aberration. Therefore, most objectives have some kind of correction to allow multiple colors to focus at the same point. The easiest correction is an achromatic lens, which uses a combination of crown glass and flint glass to bring two colors into focus. Achromatic objectives are a typical standard design.

In addition to oxide glasses, fluorite lenses are often used in specialty applications. These fluorite or semi-apochromat objectives deal with color better than achromatic objectives. To reduce aberration even further, more complex designs such as apochromat and superachromat objectives are also used.

All these types of objectives will exhibit some spherical aberration. While the center of the image will be in focus, the edges will be slightly blurry. When this aberration is corrected, the objective is called a &quot;plan&quot; objective, and has a flat image across the field of view.

===Working distance===
The &quot;working distance&quot; (sometimes abbreviated WD) is the distance between the sample and the objective. As magnification increases, working distances generally shrinks. When space is needed, special long working distance objectives can be used.

===Immersion lenses===
Some microscopes use an oil-immersion or water-immersion lens, which can have magnification greater than 100, and numerical aperture greater than 1. These objectives are specially designed for use with refractive index matching oil or water, which must fill the gap between the front element and the object. These lenses give greater resolution at high magnification. Numerical apertures as high as 1.6 can be achieved with oil immersion.

===Mounting threads===
The traditional screw thread used to attach the objective to the microscope was standardized by the Royal Microscopical Society in 1858. It was based on the British Standard Whitworth, with a 0.8 inch diameter and 36 threads per inch. This &quot;RMS thread&quot; or &quot;society thread&quot; is still in common use today. Alternatively, some objective manufacturers use designs based on ISO metric screw thread such as and .

==Photography and imaging==

Camera lenses (usually referred to as &quot;photographic objectives&quot; instead of simply &quot;objectives&quot;) need to cover a large focal plane so are made up of a number of optical lens elements to correct optical aberrations. Image projectors (such as video, movie, and slide projectors) use objective lenses that simply reverse the function of a camera lens, with lenses designed to cover a large image plane and project it at a distance onto another surface.
==Telescopes==

In a telescope the objective is the lens at the front end of a refracting telescope (such as binoculars or telescopic sights) or the image-forming primary mirror of a reflecting or catadioptric telescope. A telescope&#x27;s light-gathering power and angular resolution are both directly related to the diameter (or &quot;aperture&quot;) of its objective lens or mirror. The larger the objective, the brighter the objects will appear and the more detail it can resolve.

<doc id="420232" wikidata="Q560343" url="?curid=420232" title="Claude Favre de Vaugelas">
<text>Claude Favre de Vaugelas (6 January 1585 – 26 February 1650) was a Savoyard grammarian and man of letters. Although a lifelong courtier, Claude Favre was widely known by the name of one of the landed estates he owned as &quot;seigneur&quot; of Vaugelas and baron of Peroges.

Born at Meximieux, in the Duchy of Savoy, he became gentleman-in-waiting to Gaston, Duke of Orléans, and continued faithful to this prince in his disgrace, although his fidelity cost him a pension from the crown on which he was largely dependent. His father was the distinguished president Antoine Favre and his mother bore the same name as her husband (Favre). She got the Vaugelas&#x27;s estate, by birth.

His thorough knowledge of the French language and the correctness of his speech won him a place among the original members of the Académie française in 1634. On the representation of his colleagues his pension was restored so that he might have leisure to pursue his &quot;Remarques sur la langue française&quot; (1647). In this work he maintained that words and expressions were to be judged by the current usage of the best society, of which, as a regular of the Hôtel de Rambouillet, Vaugelas was a competent judge. He shares with François de Malherbe the credit of having purified French diction. His book fixed the current usage, and the classical writers of the 17th century regulated their practice by it.

Protests against the academical doctrine were not lacking. Scipion Dupleix in his &quot;Liberté de la langue française dans sa pureté&quot; (1651) pleaded for the richer and freer language of the 16th century, and François de La Mothe-Le-Vayer took a similar standpoint in his &quot;Lettres à Gabriel Naudé tombant les Remarques sur la langue française&quot;.

Towards the end of his life Vaugelas became tutor to the sons of Thomas Francis of Savoy, Prince of Carignano. He died in Paris in February 1650.

His translation from Quintus Curtius, &quot;La Vie d&#x27;Alexandre&quot; (posthumously published in 1653), deserves notice as an application of the author&#x27;s own rules.

<text>Caroline Louise Flint (born 20 September 1961) is a British politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Don Valley from 1997 to 2019. A member of the Labour Party, she attended the Cabinet as Minister for Housing and Planning in 2008 and Minister for Europe from 2008 to 2009.

One of 101 female Labour MPs elected at the 1997 general election, Flint served in the government of Tony Blair as a junior Home Office Minister from 2003 to 2005 and Public Health Minister from 2005 to 2007. She remained in government under Gordon Brown as both Employment Minister and a Regional Minister from 2007 until 2008, when she was promoted to the Cabinet. She resigned in 2009, citing disagreement with the leadership of the Prime Minister.

Flint was elected to the shadow cabinet following Labour&#x27;s 2010 election defeat, and appointed Shadow Communities and Local Government Secretary by opposition leader Ed Miliband. She was Shadow Energy and Climate Change Secretary from 2011 to 2015, and finished third-place in the 2015 deputy Labour leadership contest. Flint returned to the backbenches in 2015 and was defeated in her seat at the 2019 general election.

==Early life and career==
Caroline was born on 20 September 1961 at a home for unmarried mothers in Twickenham, Middlesex. Her mother, Wendy Beasley, was a typist who gave birth to her at 17-years old. Caroline never knew her father&#x27;s identity, but she was adopted at 2 year-old by TV technician Peter Flint after he married her mother. She grew-up in a one-bedroom flat with her parents and half-brother and sister, but lost contact with Peter after he divorced her mother during her early teens. After becoming a heavy drinker, Wendy died from liver failure at the age of 45.

She was educated at Twickenham Girls&#x27; School and Richmond Tertiary College. Flint earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of East Anglia in American Literature/History with Film Studies. She joined the Labour Party in 1979 and served as women&#x27;s officer for the National Organisation of Labour Students from 1982 to 1984.

Flint began her career at the Inner London Education Authority, where she was management trainee from 1984 to 1985 and policy officer from 1985 to 1987. She was head of the women&#x27;s unit at the National Union of Students from 1988 to 1989. Flint worked at Lambeth Council as an equal opportunities Officer from 1989 to 1991, and a welfare and staff development officer from 1991 to 1993. She was a senior researcher and political officer for the trade union GMB from 1994 to 1997.

==Parliamentary career==
Flint was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Don Valley at the 1997 general election. She was re-elected at the 2001, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2017 general elections. She is a member of the Fabian Society and of Labour Friends of Israel.

=== Parliamentary Private Secretary (1999–2003) ===
Flint became Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Peter Hain in 1999, while he was a Minister of State at the Department of Trade and Industry and Foreign Office. She changes roles to become PPS to John Reid in 2002, while he served as Leader of the House of Commons and Minister without portfolio.

=== Junior Minister and Minister (2003–2008) ===
She entered government as a junior minister in June 2003, as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Home Affairs. During her tenure at the Home Office, Flint reclassified magic mushrooms as a Class A drug. She pushed through the bill despite some concerns from Parliamentary colleagues.

Flint was moved to the Public health portfolio at the Department of Health in May 2005, initially as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State and as a Minister of State from May 2006. As a health minister, she was responsible for government programmes such as the prevention of communicable diseases and sex education. She oversaw campaigns to tackle issues such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.

In the 2007 deputy Labour leadership election, Flint was the campaign manager for cabinet minister Hazel Blears. Her bid was unsuccessful, and she finished sixth-place in the election.

After Gordon Brown became Prime Minister, Flint moved to the Department for Work and Pensions as Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform. She was also appointed to one of the new regional ministerial roles, as Minister for Yorkshire and the Humber.

=== Cabinet Minister (2008–2009) ===
In January 2008, Flint was promoted to attend the Cabinet of the United Kingdom as Minister of State for Housing and Planning. She was also appointed to the Privy Council. During her tenure in the role, Flint suggested unemployed council tenants should &quot;actively seek work&quot; as a condition of their occupancy. She once inadvertently revealed house price forecasts when her briefing papers were visible to the press.

Flint moved roles to become Minister of State for Europe in the October 2008 government reshuffle. Although remaining a Cabinet attendee, she was now only entitled to attend when her brief was on the agenda. Flint notably oversaw the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty into UK law in her role, and was criticised for admitting to not fully reading the document.

She resigned from government after the June 2009 reshuffle, asserting that Brown ran a &quot;two-tier government&quot; and treated her as &quot;female window dressing&quot;. Flint renewed her attack on Brown in a subsequent &quot;Observer&quot; article, complaining of &quot;constant pressure&quot; and &quot;negative bullying&quot;.

In an investigation following the 2009 expenses scandal, she was required to repay £572 in over-claimed expenses. Flint voted in-favour of legislation which would have kept MPs&#x27; expense details secret.

=== Shadow Cabinet Minister and Deputy Leadership (2010–2015) ===

Following Labour&#x27;s defeat at the 2010 general election, Flint was elected to the shadow cabinet in October 2010. She was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government by party leader Ed Miliband, and reshuffled to Shadow Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change in October 2011. Flint abstained on the 2011 Commons vote on military intervention in Libya.

Following the 2015 general election, she stood as a candidate in the deputy Labour leadership election. Seen as an early front-runner, she gained 43 MP nominations but finished third-place.

=== Return to Backbenches (2015–2019) ===
In the 2015 Parliament, Flint was a member of the Public Accounts Committee, Intelligence and Security Committee, Administration Committee, Education Sub-Committee, Education and Employment Committee, and Modernisation of the Commons Committee.

She campaigned for Remain during the 2016 EU referendum, in opposition to her leave-voting constituency. Following the vote, Flint called for acceptance of the result to &quot;allow the voices of her constituents to be heard&quot;. She supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the subsequent Labour leadership election.

Flint was a frequent rebel against the Labour leadership&#x27;s Brexit position, defying the party whip on several votes to support the government and oppose pro-EU bills and amendments. She was one of six Labour MPs to vote in favour of Prime Minister Boris Johnson&#x27;s Brexit withdrawal agreement.

Following flooding in her constituency in November 2019, she called on the Prime Minister to declare a national emergency to provide financial help to affected families.

Flint lost her seat at the 2019 general election to Conservative candidate Nick Fletcher. She attributed the defeat to Corbyn&#x27;s leadership, criticising the party for losing public trust and being too city-centric and anti-Brexit. In a later interview, she claimed that shadow cabinet minister Emily Thornberry had called northern Brexit voters &quot;stupid&quot;. Thornberry denied the allegation and threatened legal action against Flint. Following her election defeat, she was described by Prime Minister Boris Johnson as &quot;first-rate&quot; and mentioned by Cabinet Minister Michael Gove as the Labour Leader he would have feared most.

==Post-parliamentary career==
Flint was appointed to chair the Humber Teaching NHS Foundation Trust in May 2021 and Committee on Fuel Poverty in January 2022.

She made several appearances on GB News from August 2021, but ceased to appear several months later.

==Personal life==
Flint&#x27;s first marriage was to Saief Zammel, a Tunisian stockbroker, with whom she had a son, Karim, and daughter, Hanna. In 1990, she divorced Zammel, who was charged with violent disorder and later deported from England after an incident involving her.

She remarried to Phil Cole, a PR professional and former Labour Party officer, in July 2001. Flint later employed him as her constituency office manager, and he has been a Member of Doncaster Council since 2012. They reside in Sprotbrough, South Yorkshire.

Along with several other Labour women MPs, she was a member of a tap dancing troupe known as the Division Belles.

<doc id="420251" wikidata="Q2749196" url="?curid=420251" title="Operation Abercrombie">
<text>During World War II, Operation Abercrombie was an Anglo-Canadian reconnaissance raid on the area around the French coastal village of Hardelot, located south of Boulogne-sur-Mer, in the Pas-de-Calais. It had been scheduled for the night of 19/20 April 1942, but delayed until 21/22 April. The raid was largely unopposed but, on review, the benefits were thought not to have been worth the effort. Due to a navigation error the Canadian detachment lost their way and had to abort.

==Objectives==
The operation was a reconnaissance in force, intended to reconnoitre the beaches off the village of Hardelot, to capture prisoners and destroy as much equipment as possible, including a searchlight battery.

==Preparation and plans==
The force comprised B and C troops (about 100 men) of No. 4 Commando, 50 men from the Canadian Carleton and York Regiment, (2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade) and some Royal Engineers, under the overall command of Major The Lord Lovat of No.4 Commando.

The Commandos trained in the New Forest and Lepe, near Southampton, based aboard the landing ship, HMS &quot;Prince Albert&quot; on which they were transported to Dover on 18 April. The force was to be carried to France on motor gun boats (MGBs) and there transferred to assault landing craft (LCAs), which the MGBs had towed.

C Troop was to land first, clear obstacles and establish a beachhead; B Troop would pass through C Troop, head inland and execute their tasks. The return journey would be in the LCAs.

==Raid==
This was the first occasion the new LCA (Landing Craft Assault) was employed, equipped with two machine guns and a mortar.

The convoy of MGBs and LCAs set off on the evening of April 19 but after two hours, an LCA took on water and sank. The two crewmen were recovered but two commandos who had manned a Bren gun were lost and after the search was abandoned the force returned to Dover. A second attempt was made on April 21, with a replacement LCA. The Canadian detachment experienced navigational problems and became separated, eventually attracting tracer fire from the shore returned by their accompanying MGBs (Motor Gun Boats). No Canadian troops disembarked. The Commandos landed further north than intended but were unopposed and escaped detection until among the deep sand dunes and wire entanglements. Support fire from the LCAs partially suppressed moderate German tracer fire from the flanks and the commandos were able to progress.

Defences were found to be light and/or abandoned as they advanced and only three Germans were encountered at close quarters who withdrew immediately. The official report recorded, &quot;no determined opposition&quot;. A fighting patrol of 12 men sent to destroy the searchlights reached their objective but had to retire before pressing home their attack due to lack of time remaining signaled by the re-call rocket.

The only Allied casualty was a commando who was shot through the ankles after failing to respond to a beachhead sentry&#x27;s challenge quickly enough. Supporting Navy craft encountered and engaged enemy vessels, including E Boats, sinking at least one and damaging others, for three naval casualties. Enemy casualties were unknown.

==Review==
Experience of the operation contributed towards Operation Jubilee, the major Combined Operations raid on Dieppe, France, the following August.

<doc id="420256" wikidata="Q3388847" url="?curid=420256" title="John Paterson (New York politician)">
<text>John Paterson (often spelled Patterson) (1744 – July 19, 1808) was a major general in the Continental Army during the American Revolution, and a U.S. Congressman from New York.

==Early life==
Paterson was born in 1744 in either Farmington or New Britain in the Connecticut Colony. His mother was Ruth (Bird) Paterson, and his father Colonel John Paterson (1708–1762), was a militia veteran of the French and Indian War, who died during the Siege of Havana. He graduated from Yale College in 1762, studied law, attained admission to the bar, and practiced in New Britain. He was a justice of the peace in New Britain until 1774, when he moved to Lenox, Massachusetts. Paterson was elected to the Lenox board of selectmen and as a town assessor. The town&#x27;s proprietor&#x27;s also chose him to serve as their clerk, which required him to maintain records of land transactions and ownership. He was elected to represent Lenox in the Massachusetts House of Representatives in both 1774 and 1775. He also represented Lenox at the 1774 Berkshire Convention, held in Stockbridge, Massachusetts to discuss how to respond to the Boston Port Act. When the governor dissolved the legislature as pre-revolution tensions continued to rise, the people of Massachusetts formed a provincial Congress. Paterson was elected as Lenox&#x27;s representative in both 1774 and 1775.

==American Revolution==

When the American Revolution began in April 1775 Paterson was commissioned as a colonel by the Massachusetts Committee of Safety, and he marched with his militia unit to take part in the Siege of Boston. Paterson&#x27;s command, the 1st Massachusetts Regiment saw action at the Battle of Bunker Hill. After the British evacuation of Boston, Paterson&#x27;s regiment took part in the Invasion of Canada and the battles of Trenton and Princeton in New Jersey. On February 21, 1777 Paterson was promoted to brigadier general in the Continental Army.

During the Saratoga Campaign of 1777 Paterson commanded a brigade of Horatio Gates&#x27; army, consisting of the 10th, 11th, 12th, and 14th Massachusetts Regiments, and the 1st Berkshire County Militia Regiment.

Paterson served under George Washington at the Battle of Monmouth in 1778. He served primarily in the Hudson Valley of New York until the end of the war. In September 1783, he received promotion to major general, and he was discharged in December 1783. Paterson was one of the last generals to leave active duty at the end of the war.

While Paterson served in New York in 1782 and 1783, his personal staff included Private Robert Shirtliff of the 4th Massachusetts Regiment, who served as a waiter. Shirtliff (also spelled Shirtliffe or Shurtleff) was later revealed to be Deborah Sampson, a woman who had disguised herself as a man in order to join the Continental Army. Rather than reprimand her, as had often been the case with women discovered in the ranks, Paterson provided her with a certificate of honorable discharge, a note with words of encouragement, and money sufficient to pay for travel to her home in Massachusetts.

In January 1783, Paterson took part in the organizational meeting that created the Society of the Cincinnati, and he was one of the society&#x27;s charter members.

==Return to Massachusetts==
After the war Paterson returned to Massachusetts, where he resumed practicing law, and also served in local offices including town meeting moderator, selectman, fence viewer, tax assessor, and highway surveyor. In addition, he was the leader of the successful movement to locate the Berkshire County seat in Lenox. (It was moved to Pittsfield in 1860.) In 1785, he was again elected to represent Lenox in the state House of Representatives. In 1786, he was commissioned as a major general in the Massachusetts Militia, and assigned to command the militia&#x27;s 9th Division. In 1786 and 1787, Paterson commanded militia units that took part in the quelling of Shays&#x27;s Rebellion.

==Move to New York==

In 1790, Paterson was one of the investors in the Boston Patent, a large land grant in Broome and Tioga Counties, New York. In 1791, he moved to Lisle, a newly-organized town in Tioga County. He was a member of the New York State Assembly in 1793. The area of Lisle where Paterson settled was later organized as the town of Triangle; the site of his home and farm was in what is now the village of Whitney Point.

In 1798, Paterson was appointed judge of the Tioga County Court, and he served until 1806. When Broome County was organized separately from Tioga in 1806, Paterson was appointed judge of the new county&#x27;s court.

In the late 1700s and early 1800s, Deborah Sampson published a memoir and made a lecture tour in which she gave presentations about her military service. Her tour took her to New York, and from November to December 1802, she visited Paterson in Lisle. While she stayed with Paterson, Sampson was able to take part in reunions with other former Massachusetts soldiers who had settled in the area of the Boston Patent.

In 1802, Paterson was a successful Democratic-Republican candidate for the United States House of Representatives. He served in the 8th United States Congress (March 4, 1803 – March 3, 1805), and was not a candidate for reelection in 1804.

==Death and burial==
Paterson died in Lisle on July 19, 1808. He was originally interred at Riverside Cemetery in Whitney Point. In 1892 he was reburied at Church on the Hill Cemetery in Lenox, Massachusetts.

==Family==
In 1766, Paterson married Elizabeth Lee. They were the parents of seven children, including:
* Josiah Lee (1766–1846), who married Clarissa Hyde
* Hannah (1769–1803), the wife of Azariah Egleston
* Polly (1773–1790)
* Ruth (1774–1842), the wife of Ira Seymour
* Betsey (1784–1784)
* John Pierce (1787–1842), who married Sally Osborn
* Mariah (1790–1865), the wife of Samuel Kilborn

Congressman Thomas J. Paterson (1805–1885) and State Senator John E. Paterson (born 1800) were Paterson&#x27;s grandsons. Scientist and academic Thomas Egleston was his great-grandson.

<text>The Abipones (, singular ) were an indigenous people of Argentina&#x27;s Gran Chaco region, speakers of one of the Guaicuruan languages. They ceased to exist as an independent ethnic group in the early 19th century. A small number of survivors assimilated into Argentine society.

==History==
The Abipones originally occupied the Gran Chaco of Argentina, in the lower portions of the Bermejo River. They were originally a seasonally mobile people of hunters, gatherers, fishers and to a limited extent farmers.

By 1641, the Abipones had already obtained the horse from the Spanish settlers and abandoned farming for cattle and horse raiding. By that time they still lived north of the Bermejo River They became feared by their neighbours and the Spanish farmers, and even threatened major cities.

It is likely they were driven south of their original range by the Spaniards and other native tribes, such as the Tobas. They were finally concentrated in the Argentinian territory lying between Santa Fe and Santiago del Estero, between the Rio Bermejo on the north and the Salado River on the south.

Before the introduction of the horse in the region, they subsisted by hunting, fishing, food gathering and only a limited amount of agriculture. With the horse, came a change in the regional and in particular the Abipon&#x27;s way of surviving. They shifted away from agriculture and towards hunting from horseback, wild cattle, rhea, guanaco, deer, and peccary. The horses also lead them to raid the Spanish ranches and even the cities of Asuncion and Corrientes.

From 1710, a major military effort by the Spanish began gradually to impose authority on the Abipones. By 1750 Jesuit missions had been established among them (chiefly by Martin Dobrizhoffer, who had been a missionary in Paraguay for eighteen years), and they had been largely Christianized and turned sedentary. The colonies had incessant trouble with Spanish settlers, and were often raided by the Tobas and the Mocovís, hostile Guaycuru peoples. 
By 1768, over half of the Abipones had succumbed to disease and they numbered not more than 5,000. The expulsion of the Jesuits by the Spaniards in that year was fatal for the Abipones. When they attempted to resume their former lifestyles, they found their traditional lands occupied by settlers and other indigenous nations. The Tobas and Mocovís, aided by disease, destroyed them as a nation in the course of less than half a century. The survivors assimilated into the general Argentinian population. They learned to speak Spanish, and abandoned their old customs.

The last speaker of the Abipón language is believed to have died in the 19th century.

==Appearance and customs==
According to Martin Dobrizhoffer, who lived among them for a period of seven years, the Abipones were a group of tall, well-formed, handsome people, with black eyes, aquiline noses and thick black hair, which they plucked out from the forehead to the crown as a tribal mark. The faces, breasts and arms of the women were tattooed with black figures of various designs according to their age and social status, and the lips and ears of both sexes were pierced.

The men were brave fighters, their chief weapons being the bow and arrow, the spear and the club –all of which were carved out of a local hardwood tree known to them as &quot;netergé–&quot;, as well as the boleadoras. In battle, they wore an armour fashioned out of a tapir&#x27;s hide, over which a jaguar&#x27;s skin was sewn. Even Abipón women were reputedly aggressive and held considerable power in their people&#x27;s religious rites. 

The Abipones were good swimmers and horsemen. During the five-month-long flood season, they lived on islands or even in shelters built in the trees.

They shared most of the customs of the Guaycurú, including the couvade. They seldom married before the age of thirty, and were singularly chaste. Charles Darwin reported that &quot;With the Abipones when a man chooses a wife, he bargains with the parents about the price. But it frequently happens that the girl rescinds what has been agreed upon between the parents and bridegroom, obstinately rejecting the very mention of marriage. She often runs away and hides herself, and thus eludes the bridegroom.&quot; Infanticide was common, never more than two children being reared in one family. The young were suckled for two years.

<text>Aequian is an extinct Italic language presumed spoken by the people the Romans termed Aequi and Aequicoli living in the Alban hills of northeast Latium and the central Apennines east of them during the early and middle Roman Republic; that is, approximately from the 5th to the 3rd century BC, when they were defeated by the armies of Rome and were subsequently Romanized. As the area was heavily colonized by Latin speakers from Rome, most of the inscriptions from there are in Latin. Two undated inscriptions appear to be in a different dialect, termed Aequian by the scholars with the presumption that in fact they represent the language of the entire pre-Roman tribe. Not enough text survives to deduce any more than that it belonged to the Italic branch of the Indo-European language family.

==Corpus==
Aequian is scantily documented by two inscriptions. Conway&#x27;s publication of Italic inscriptions adds a gloss, several place names and several dozen personal names, but it does not distinguish which of these are certainly endonyms and which are Latin exonyms in use by the Latin-speaking population. It is possible that they would have been the same in both cases, but such a hypothesis remains unproven.

The Inscription of Alba Fucens is a bronze plate inscribed with . Conway reconstructs the first word as , a dative case. Baldi translates the text into Latin as , two datives, and into English as &quot;To the (god named) Alban Father.&quot;

The second document is the Inscription of Cliternia (Capradosso) in Petrella Salto, an inscribed stone in a spring dissociated from context by nature (it rolled down a hill). The text is:
: 

which is a notice stating that the road is private, passage by permission of Titus Umbrenus, son of Gaius, but beasts of burden are forbidden.

==Early life==
Kinnear was born on 8 January 1934 in Wigan, Lancashire, the son of Annie (née Durie, previously Smith) and Roy Kinnear. He had a sister, Marjory. His parents were Scottish, originally from Edinburgh. His father was an international in both rugby union and rugby league, having played for and Great Britain. He scored 81 tries in 184 games for Wigan; he collapsed and died while playing rugby union with the RAF in 1942, at the age of 38.

Kinnear was educated at George Heriot&#x27;s School in Edinburgh. Aged 17, he enrolled in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). 

==Career==
Kinnear&#x27;s acting career began in 1955, playing Albert in &quot;The Young in Heart&quot;, at the repertory theatre, Newquay. In 1959 he joined Joan Littlewood&#x27;s Theatre Workshop at the Theatre Royal Stratford East, performing in both the 1960 play and 1963 film of &quot;Sparrows Can&#x27;t Sing&quot;.

Kinnear&#x27;s television debut was on the STV children&#x27;s series &quot;Mr. Fixit&quot; in 1959, before gaining national attention as a participant in the television show &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;.

Kinnear later appeared in many films and television shows, including &quot;Help!&quot;, &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;, &quot;Doctor at Large&quot;, &quot;Man About the House&quot;, &quot;George and Mildred&quot;, &quot;The Dick Emery Show&quot; (as Gaylord&#x27;s long-suffering father) and four episodes of &quot;The Avengers&quot;. He starred in &quot;Cowboys&quot;, a sitcom about builders. His best-known films are those he made with director and close friend Richard Lester: &quot;Help!&quot;, &quot;A Funny Thing Happened On the Way to the Forum&quot;, &quot;How I Won the War&quot;, &quot;The Bed Sitting Room&quot;, &quot;Juggernaut&quot; and the &quot;Musketeer&quot; series of the 1970s and 1980s.

He appeared with Christopher Lee in the Hammer horror film &quot;Taste the Blood of Dracula&quot; (1970). Also in 1970 he played Mr. Perkins, Melody&#x27;s father in Waris Hussein&#x27;s &quot;Melody&quot;, a puppy love story. He played the father of spoiled rich girl Veruca Salt in the film &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; (1971), an adaptation of Roald Dahl&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;.

He guest-starred in &quot;The Goodies&#x27;&quot; episode &quot;Rome Antics&quot; (1975) as the Roman Emperor, and in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Ripping Yarns&quot; episode &quot;Escape From Stalag Luft 112B&quot; (1977) as the fearsome German Sergeant Vogel.

He narrated and provided voices for the stop-motion children&#x27;s television show &quot;Bertha&quot;. He appeared in two music videos for Mike and the Mechanics (&quot;All I Need Is a Miracle&quot; and &quot;Taken In&quot;) as the band&#x27;s manager; in the former, he was reunited with his &quot;Help!&quot; co-star Victor Spinetti.

He narrated &quot;Towser&quot; and &quot;Bertha&quot;, voiced Pipkin in the 1978 film &quot;Watership Down&quot; and voiced Texas Pete&#x27;s henchman Bulk in &quot;SuperTed&quot; (also with Victor Spinetti, who voiced the evil Texas Pete). Kinnear appeared regularly on the stage. In later life he appeared in productions such as &quot;The Travails of Sancho Panza&quot; (playing the title role), and in &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, in 1985.

His final completed roles were in &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1988) a made-for-television film directed by and starring Charlton Heston, John Gielgud and Vanessa Redgrave, as a patient in the BBC One hospital drama &quot;Casualty&quot;, and a voice role as Mump in &quot;The Princess and the Goblin&quot;, which was released in 1991, three years after his sudden death in September 1988. Following his death, the &quot;Casualty&quot; episode was postponed. It finally aired in August 1989. In Oct 1988 Radio 4 first broadcast &quot;The T Machine&quot;, an episode of the comedy series &quot;The Fall of the Mausoleum Club&quot; in which he played the lead character, Mr Tilly.

==Personal life and death==
Kinnear was married to actress Carmel Cryan. They had three children, including actor Rory and casting director Kirsty. Their elder daughter, Karina, was a quadriplegic and had profound learning difficulties; she died in May 2020 from coronavirus, and was buried very close to her father. 

 On 19 September 1988, Kinnear fell from a horse during the making of &quot;The Return of the Musketeers&quot; in Toledo, Spain, sustaining a broken pelvis and internal bleeding. He died the next day in Ruber International Hospital in Madrid, from a heart attack, brought on by his injuries. He was 54.

Kinnear was buried in East Sheen Cemetery, London. Following his death, Kinnear&#x27;s family sued the production company and Richard Lester, the film&#x27;s director. In 1991, they received a £650,000 settlement.

==Legacy==
In May 1994, the &quot;Roy Kinnear Trust&quot;, which was inspired by his daughter, Karina (1972–2020), was founded to help improve the life of young adults with physical and mental disabilities.

<text>In astronomy, a galactic bulge (or simply bulge) is a tightly packed group of stars within a larger star formation. The term almost exclusively refers to the central group of stars found in most spiral galaxies (see galactic spheroid). Bulges were historically thought to be elliptical galaxies that happened to have a disk of stars around them, but high-resolution images using the Hubble Space Telescope have revealed that many bulges lie at the heart of a spiral galaxy. It is now thought that there are at least two types of bulges: bulges that are like ellipticals and bulges that are like spiral galaxies.

== Classical bulges ==

Bulges that have properties similar to those of elliptical galaxies are often called &quot;classical bulges&quot; due to their similarity to the historic view of bulges. These bulges are composed primarily of stars that are older, Population II stars, and hence have a reddish hue (see stellar evolution). These stars are also in orbits that are essentially random compared to the plane of the galaxy, giving the bulge a distinct spherical form. Due to the lack of dust and gases, bulges tend to have almost no star formation. The distribution of light is described by a Sersic profile.

Classical bulges are thought to be the result of collisions of smaller structures. Convulsing gravitational forces and torques disrupt the orbital paths of stars, resulting in the randomised bulge orbits. If either progenitor galaxy was gas-rich, the tidal forces can also cause inflows to the newly merged galaxy nucleus. Following a major merger, gas clouds are more likely to convert into stars, due to shocks (see star formation).
One study has suggested that about 80% of galaxies in the field lack a classical bulge,
indicating that they have never experienced a major merger.
The bulgeless galaxy fraction of the Universe has remained roughly constant for at least the last 8 billion years.
In contrast, about two thirds of galaxies in dense galaxy clusters (such as the Virgo Cluster) do possess a classical bulge, demonstrating the disruptive effect of their crowding.

== Disk-like bulges ==
Many bulges have properties more similar to those of the central regions of spiral galaxies than elliptical galaxies. They are often referred to as &quot;pseudobulges&quot; or &quot;disky-bulges.&quot; These bulges have stars that are not orbiting randomly, but rather orbit in an ordered fashion in the same plane as the stars in the outer disk. This contrasts greatly with elliptical galaxies.

Subsequent studies (using the Hubble Space Telescope) show that the bulges of many galaxies are not devoid of dust, but rather show a varied and complex structure. This structure often looks similar to a spiral galaxy, but is much smaller. Giant spiral galaxies are typically 2–100 times the size of those spirals that exist in bulges. Where they exist, these central spirals dominate the light of the bulge in which they reside. Typically the rate at which new stars are formed in pseudobulges is similar to the rate at which stars form in disk galaxies. Sometimes bulges contain nuclear rings that are forming stars at much higher rate (per area) than is typically found in outer disks, as shown in NGC 4314 (see photo).

Properties such as spiral structure and young stars suggest that some bulges did not form through the same process that made elliptical galaxies and classical bulges. Yet the theories for the formation of pseudobulges are less certain than those for classical bulges. Pseudobulges may be the result of extremely gas-rich mergers that happened more recently than those mergers that formed classical bulges (within the last 5 billion years). However, it is difficult for disks to survive the merging process, casting doubt on this scenario.

Many astronomers suggest that bulges that appear similar to disks form outside of the disk, and are not the product of a merging process. When left alone, disk galaxies can rearrange their stars and gas (as a response to instabilities). The products of this process (called secular evolution) are often observed in such galaxies; both spiral disks and galactic bars can result from secular evolution of galaxy disks. Secular evolution is also expected to send gas and stars to the center of a galaxy. If this happens that would increase the density at the center of the galaxy, and thus make a bulge that has properties similar to those of disk galaxies.

If secular evolution, or the slow, steady evolution of a galaxy, is responsible for the formation of a significant number of bulges, then that many galaxies have not experienced a merger since the formation of their disk. This would then mean that current theories of galaxy formation and evolution greatly over-predict the number of mergers in the past few billion years.

== Boxy/peanut bulge for edge-on galaxies ==

Edge-on galaxies can sometimes have a boxy/peanut bulge with an X-shape. The boxy nature of the Milky Way bulge was revealed by the COBE satellite and later confirmed with the VVV survey with the help of red clump stars. The VVV survey also found two overlapping populations of red clump stars and an X-shape of the bulge. The WISE satellite later confirmed the X-shape of the bulge. The X-shape makes up 45% of the mass of the bulge in the Milky Way. The boxy/peanut bulges are in fact the bar of a galaxy seen edge-on. Other edge-on galaxies can also show a boxy/peanut bar sometimes with an X-shape.

== Central compact mass ==
Most bulges and pseudo-bulges are thought to host a central relativistic compact mass,
which is traditionally assumed to be a supermassive black hole. Such black holes by definition cannot be observed directly (light cannot escape them), but various pieces of evidence suggest their existence, both in the bulges of spiral galaxies and in the centers of ellipticals. The masses of the black holes correlate tightly with bulge properties.
The M–sigma relation relates black hole mass to the velocity dispersion of bulge stars, 
while other correlations involve the total stellar mass or luminosity of the bulge, 
the central concentration of stars in the bulge, 
the richness of the globular cluster system orbiting in the galaxy&#x27;s far outskirts,
and the winding angle of the spiral arms.

Until recently it was thought that one could not have a supermassive black hole without a surrounding bulge.
Galaxies hosting supermassive black holes without accompanying bulges have now been observed.
The implication is that the bulge environment is not strictly essential to the initial seeding and growth of massive black holes.

<doc id="420281" wikidata="Q4809654" url="?curid=420281" title="Association of British Counties">
<text>The Association of British Counties (ABC) is a non-party-political society formed in 1989 by television personality Russell Grant to promote the historic counties of the United Kingdom. It argues that the historic counties are an important part of Britain&#x27;s cultural heritage and as such should be preserved and promoted. It also proposes that there be a clear official distinction between the historic counties and the administrative units known as counties—first described as a separate entity in the Local Government Act 1888.

==Definitions and county boundaries recognised by the Association==

The ABC recognises ninety-two historic counties of the United Kingdom; and provides a gazetteer of British place names to enable their identification. The gazetteer identifies the corresponding historic county with respect to the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844, in addition to cross-referencing other administrative areas.

The Association does not believe that counties corporate enjoy county status &quot;in the ordinary sense of the term&quot; and includes them within the historic county or counties in which they lie geographically.

The association declares that the &quot;most authoritative definition of the boundaries of the Counties of Great Britain is that obtained by the Ordnance Survey during its first national survey of Great Britain&quot;.

Areas transferred from one county to another by the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844 are &quot;considered to be associated with both their parent County (from which they are detached) and the County in which they locally lie.&quot;

==Aims and objectives==
The ABC has declared that it does not want further local government reorganisation. Instead it would rather see an official distinction made between current administrative units known as counties, and those areas known as counties before the local government reforms of 1965 and 1974, which were not abolished.

It seeks to bring about an official change in government terminology to bring it in line with its interpretation of the Local Government Act 1888—the original piece of legislation which created the county councils in England and Wales, though there have since been several further changes. The Act specifically called the areas it created &quot;administrative counties&quot; (although it also amended what it called the &quot;counties&quot;), and the ABC wishes to see this terminology consistently used to describe them. Also it wishes to see the term &quot;county&quot; stripped from the unitary authorities that use it, a measure which it claims will remove what it sees as confusion resulted from the status of various entities termed counties since 1888. In particular, ABC uses scare quotes around the word &quot;county&quot; when not referring to the counties as defined by them.

Other policies include:

*compelling the Ordnance Survey to mark the historic county borders on their maps
*lobbying for the erection of boundary signs at these boundaries
*making the ceremonial counties match the boundaries of the historic counties they promote
*that the English regions should be redefined in order to ensure that the counties as they describe them should &quot;be brought wholly within one region or another&quot;

==Activities==

===Local government===
The ABC was founded in 1989, holding its inaugural conference on 1 April in historic Monmouthshire. This was at the beginning of a period of review of local government areas: in March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment, Nicholas Ridley had ordered an urgent review of the future of Humberside. Later in April the MP Nicholas Bennett unsuccessfully introduced a bill into the Commons to introduce a system of unitary authorities in Wales based on historic counties. Following the establishment of the Local Government Commission for England in 1992, the ABC became active in the review process, advocating the restoration of historic county boundaries. The LGCE&#x27;s review resulted in the restoration of Herefordshire and Rutland to local government and ceremonial status, and the abolition of the unpopular counties of Avon, Cleveland and Humberside. Attempts to resurrect Cumberland and Westmorland failed to gain the support of either the LGCE or the public. The creation of a Huntingdonshire unitary authority was also eventually rejected in spite of strong support locally.

In 2007 it was announced that a number of unitary authorities would be formed in 2009. Among the councils that were to gain unitary status were the county councils of Durham, Northumberland, Shropshire and Wiltshire, which were to absorb all of the district councils in each county. The ABC launched a campaign in November 2007 for the new unitary councils to be renamed to reflect what they asserted to be &quot;real counties&quot;: 
*They suggested that the new authority for County Durham should be named either &quot;Central Durham and Teesdale&quot; or &quot;Mid Durham and Teesdale&quot;. The leader of Durham County Council rejected this suggestion, noting that residents of the area were proud of their county name, and that the &quot;only redeeming feature is that it would give us one of the longest council names in the country&quot;. &quot;Given our proud heritage and all that our area has to offer, I would hope that our county would be known for much more than that.&quot; Another member of the council suggested that if these &quot;unelected people...want to change the name, then they should pay for it&quot;, a cost he estimated at £4 million.
*The group suggested naming the new authority for Northumberland &quot;Northumberland Heartlands Council&quot;, &quot;North and West Northumberland Council&quot;, &quot;Rural Northumberland Council&quot; or &quot;Northumberland Moors and Coast Council&quot;. However, when the people of the county were asked to choose whether they wanted the name of the council to remain as &#x27;Northumberland County Council&#x27; or to change to &#x27;Northumberland Council&#x27; the outcome was to retain the old county council name.
*Suggested renamings of Shropshire Council were &quot;Shropshire Heartlands Council&quot;, &quot;Heart of Shropshire Council&quot; and &quot;Shrewsbury and Rural Shropshire Council&quot;.
*ABC suggest naming the new authority for Wiltshire &quot;Heart of Wiltshire Council&quot;, &quot;Wiltshire Heartlands Council&quot;, &quot;Wiltshire Plains and Downs Council&quot; or &quot;Salisbury and Rural Wiltshire Council&quot;. However, the name &quot;Wiltshire Council&quot; had already been chosen in September 2007.

===Addresses and signage===
Successes for the &quot;traditional counties movement&quot; include:
*Successfully lobbying the Royal Mail to have historic, in addition to administrative and former postal, counties included in the Postcode Address File&#x27;s Alias record, which is used to &quot;find the correct postal addresses from ‘postally-not-required’ data&quot;.
*The erection of signs marking the historic boundary between Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire on the A59.
*The erection of signs by Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council marking the historic boundary between Cheshire and Lancashire.
*The erection of signs by Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council and Saddleworth Parish Council marking the historic boundary between Yorkshire and Lancashire.

===Party political support===
None of the three main political parties has a direct commitment to support the group or adopt the ABC&#x27;s cause.

UKIP has said it would &quot;dismantle regional government and return powers to traditional county and borough councils&quot; in its local-issues manifesto.

The English Democrats statement of principles states &quot;We favour recognition for traditional counties, which would include the reunification of Yorkshire&quot;.

===Parliamentary support===
Some MPs overtly support recognition of the historic counties – notably the former Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, who was quoted on the departmental website as saying: &quot;The historic English counties are one of the oldest forms of local government in Western Europe. Their roots run deep. And no amount of administrative reshuffling can delete these longstanding and cherished local identities.&quot;

A private member&#x27;s bill, the Historic Counties (Traffic Signs and Mapping) Bill, was twice introduced into the 2001–05 Parliament, first by John Randall in 2003, and again in 2004 by Adrian Flook, who &quot;[paid] tribute to the Association of British Counties for trailblazing the campaign&quot;. The Bill did not proceed to second reading in either year.

Another private member&#x27;s bill, the Historic Counties, Towns and Villages (Traffic Signs and Mapping) Bill, was introduced to Parliament on 31 January 2007 by Andrew Rosindell under the Ten Minute Rule. It was ordered to be brought in by a group of 12 MPs. Rosindell &quot;[thanks] the Association of British Counties, a society dedicated to promoting awareness of the 86 historic counties of Great Britain, which has campaigned tirelessly for their recognition through proper signage denoting historic county boundaries&quot;. The bill did not proceed beyond second reading but was supported by the Conservative opposition. It was opposed by the government.

John Butcher was an active member of the group, campaigning in Parliament during the 1990s UK local government reform. In 1991, he suggested to the Secretary of State for Wales the use of the traditional county names Radnorshire, Montgomeryshire and Monmouthshire for unitary authorities in Wales In a 1996 debate, declaring he was honorary president of the ABC, he noted his approval of the abolition of the postal counties, meaning that &quot;people who live in places like Birmingham, Walsall and Coventry can now use in their addresses the ancient pre-1974 counties&quot;.

==Commentary==

The following statements have been made regarding the status of the historic counties (though they are not Government policy statements):

Eric Pickles MP: see above

Quoted in &quot;The Times&quot; of 1 April 1974:

Paul Beresford, then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, on 4 December 1995.

==Affiliates==
When the ABC first emerged it was stated to have been &quot;formed by about 30 county groups&quot;. Among those listed at the time were the Friends of Real Lancashire, the Voice of Rutland, the Back to Somerset Campaign and the County of Middlesex Trust. Of these only the first now appears to be active.

According to their websites, the following groups are affiliated as of September 2012:
*Friends of Real Lancashire
*The Huntingdonshire Society
*The Monmouthshire Association
*The Oxfordshire Association
*The Westmorland Association
*Yorkshire Ridings Society and its local group the Saddleworth White Rose Society

<doc id="420297" wikidata="Q731908" url="?curid=420297" title="Pop (U2 album)">
<text>Pop is the ninth studio album by Irish rock band U2. It was produced by Flood, Howie B, and Steve Osborne, and was released on 3 March 1997 on Island Records. The album was a continuation of the band&#x27;s 1990s musical reinvention, as they incorporated alternative rock, techno, dance, and electronica influences into their sound. &quot;Pop&quot; employed a variety of production techniques that were relatively new to U2, including sampling, loops, programmed drum machines, and sequencing.

Recording sessions began in 1995 with various record producers, including Nellee Hooper, Flood, Howie B, and Osborne, who were introducing the band to various electronica influences. At the time, drummer Larry Mullen Jr. was inactive due to a back injury, prompting the other band members to take different approaches to songwriting. Upon Mullen&#x27;s return, the band began re-working much of their material but ultimately struggled to complete songs. After the band allowed manager Paul McGuinness to book their upcoming 1997 PopMart Tour before the record was completed, they felt rushed into delivering it. Even after delaying the album&#x27;s release date from the 1996 Christmas and holiday season to March 1997, U2 ran out of time in the studio, working up to the last minute to complete songs.

In February 1997, U2 released &quot;Pop&quot;″s techno-heavy lead single, &quot;Discothèque&quot;, one of six singles from the album. The record initially received favourable reviews from critics and reached number one in 35 countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States. However, the album&#x27;s lifetime sales are among the lowest in U2&#x27;s catalogue, and it received only a single platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. Retrospectively, the album is viewed by some of the music press and public as a disappointment. The finished product was not to U2&#x27;s liking, and they subsequently re-recorded and remixed many of the songs for single and compilation album releases. The time required to complete &quot;Pop&quot; cut into the band&#x27;s rehearsal time for the tour, which affected the quality of initial shows.

==Background and writing==
In the first half of the 1990s, U2 underwent a dramatic shift in musical style. The band had experimented with alternative rock and electronic music and the use of samples on their 1991 album, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, and, to a greater extent, on 1993&#x27;s &quot;Zooropa&quot;. In 1995, the group&#x27;s side-projects provided them an opportunity to delve even deeper into these genres. Bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. recorded &quot;Theme from Mission: Impossible&quot; in an electronica style. The recording was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance in 1997 and was an international top-ten hit. In 1995, U2 and Brian Eno recorded an experimental album, &quot;Original Soundtracks 1&quot;, under the moniker &quot;Passengers&quot;. The project included Howie B, Akiko Kobayashi and Luciano Pavarotti, among others.

Bono and the Edge had written a few songs before recording started for &quot;Pop&quot; in earnest. &quot;If You Wear That Velvet Dress&quot;, &quot;Wake Up Dead Man&quot;, &quot;Last Night on Earth&quot; and &quot;If God Will Send His Angels&quot; were originally conceived during the &quot;Zooropa&quot; sessions. &quot;Mofo&quot; and &quot;Staring at the Sun&quot; were also partly written already.

==Recording and production==
For the new record, U2 wanted to continue their sonic experimentation from &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; and &quot;Zooropa&quot;. To do so, they employed multiple producers to have additional people with whom to share their ideas. Flood was principal producer, having previously worked with the group as engineer for &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; and &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, and co-producer of &quot;Zooropa&quot;. Mark &quot;Spike&quot; Stent and Howie B were principal engineers. Flood described his job on &quot;Pop&quot; as a &quot;creative coordinator&quot;, saying, &quot;There were some tracks where I didn&#x27;t necessarily have a major involvement... but ultimately the buck stopped with me. I had the role of the creative supervisor who judged what worked and didn&#x27;t work.&quot; Howie B had previously provided mixing, treatments, and scratching for &quot;Original Soundtracks 1&quot;. On &quot;Pop&quot;, he was initially given the role of &quot;DJ and Vibes&quot; before assuming responsibilities as co-producer, engineer, and mixer. One of his main tasks was to introduce the band to sounds and influences within electronica. The band and Howie B regularly went out to dance clubs to experience club music and culture. The overall goal for the record was to create a new sound for the band that was still recognisable as U2.

U2 began work on &quot;Pop&quot; in mid-1995, collaborating with Nellee Hooper in London, France, and Ireland. In September, the band moved the recording sessions to Hanover Quay in Dublin to a studio the band had just converted from a warehouse. The studio was designed to be more of a rehearsal space more than an actual studio. Flood, Howie B, Steve Osborne, and Marius de Vries joined Hooper and the band there, each of them incorporating their influences and experiences in electronic dance music. Flood described Howie&#x27;s influence thus: &quot;Howie would be playing all kinds of records to inspire the band and for them to improvise to. That could be anything from a jazz trumpet solo to a super groove funk thing, with no holds barred. We also programmed drum loops, or took things from sample CDs; anything to get the ball rolling. U2 arrive in the studio with very little finished material.&quot; These sessions lasted until December 1995, and around 30–40 pieces of music emerged during this period.

Mullen, who had mostly been absent from the sessions to start a family and nurse a worsening back injury, had major surgery on his back in November 1995. Mullen was unable to drum properly during this period, forcing U2 to abandon their usual methods of songwriting as a group but also allowing them to pursue different musical influences. Mullen admits that he was upset that the band entered the studio without him, cognizant that key decisions would be made in the early months of recording. Eno attempted to convince the other band members to wait for Mullen, but as the Edge explains, &quot;The thinking was that we were going to further experiment with the notion of what a band was all about and find new ways to write songs, accepting the influence, and aesthetics of dance music... we thought, &#x27;Let&#x27;s just start with Howie mixing drum beats and see where that gets us.&#x27;&quot; Mullen was back in the studio three weeks after his surgery, but his back prevented him from fully dedicating himself to recording. As he described, &quot;I needed a little more time to recover. But we were struggling with some of the material and for the project to move ahead, I had to put a lot of time in.&quot; Sessions ceased temporarily in January 1996 to allow Mullen to rehabilitate.

Following Mullen&#x27;s return and the sessions&#x27; resumption in February 1996, the production team of Flood, Howie B, and Hooper spent three months attempting to re-work much of the band&#x27;s material to better incorporate loops and samples with their musical ideas from 1995. This period was a difficult one; Mullen, in particular, had to record drum parts to replace loops that Howie B had sampled without permission. Flood said, &quot;We took what we had and got the band to play to it and work it into their own idiom, while incorporating a dance ethic... The groove-orientated way of making music can be a trap when there&#x27;s no song; you end up just plowing along on one riff. So you have to try to get the groove and the song, and do it so that it sounds like the band, and do it so that it sounds like something new.&quot;

Despite the initial difficulties with sampling, the band and production team eventually became comfortable with it, even sampling Mullen&#x27;s drumming, the Edge&#x27;s guitar riffs, Clayton&#x27;s bass lines, and Bono&#x27;s vocalisations. Howie B sampled almost anything he could in order to find interesting sounds. He created sequenced patterns of the Edge&#x27;s guitar playing, which the guitarist, having never done it before, found very interesting. Howie B explained, &quot;Sometimes I would sample, say, a guitar, but it wouldn&#x27;t come back sounding like a guitar; it might sound more like a pneumatic drill, because I would take the raw sound and filter it, really destroy the guitar sound, and rebuild it into something completely different.&quot; Although sequencing was used, mostly on keyboards, guitar loops, and some percussion, it was used sparingly out of fear of becoming overreliant on it.

Nellee Hooper left the sessions in May 1996 due to his commitments to the &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; film score. The recording sessions changed radically in the last few months, which is why Hooper was not credited on the album.

By forcing the band members out of their individual comfort zones, the producers were able to change U2&#x27;s approach to songwriting and playing their instruments. Mullen, in particular, was forced to do this, as he used samples of other records, sample CDs, or programmed drums while recuperating. Although he eventually reverted to recording his own samples, the experience of using others&#x27; changed his approach to recording rhythms.

During the recording sessions, U2 allowed manager Paul McGuinness to book their upcoming PopMart Tour before they had completed the album, putting the tour&#x27;s start date at April 1997. The album was originally planned to be completed and released in time for the 1996 Christmas and holiday season, but the band found themselves struggling to complete songs, necessitating a delay in the album&#x27;s release date until March 1997. Even with the extended timeframe to complete the album, recording continued up to the last minute. Bono devised and recorded the chorus to &quot;Last Night on Earth&quot; on, coincidentally, the last night of the album&#x27;s recording and mixing. When Howie B and the Edge took the album to New York City to be mastered, changes and additions to the songs were still being made. During the process, Howie B was adding effects to &quot;Discothèque&quot;, while the Edge was recording backing vocals for &quot;The Playboy Mansion&quot;. Of the last minute changes, the Edge said, &quot;It&#x27;s a sign of absolute madness.&quot; Flood says, &quot;We had three different mixes of &#x27;Mofo&#x27;, and during mastering in November &#x27;96 in New York, I edited a final version of &#x27;Mofo&#x27; from these three mixes. So even during mastering, we were trying to push the song to another level. It was a long process of experimentation; the album didn&#x27;t actually come together until the last few months.&quot;

Ultimately, U2 felt that &quot;Pop&quot; had not been completed to their satisfaction. The Edge described the finished album as &quot;a compromise project by the end. It was a crazy period trying to mix everything and finish recording and having production meetings about the upcoming tour... If you can&#x27;t mix something, it generally means there&#x27;s something wrong with it...&quot; Mullen said, &quot;If we had two or three more months to work, we would have had a very different record. I would like someday to rework those songs and give them the attention and time that they deserve.&quot; McGuinness disagrees that the band did not have enough time, saying, &quot;It got an awful lot of time, actually. I think it suffered from too many cooks [in the kitchen]. There were so many people with a hand in that record it wasn&#x27;t surprising to me that it didn&#x27;t come through as clearly as it might have done... It was also the first time I started to think that technology was getting out of control.&quot; The band ended up re-working and re-recording many songs for the album&#x27;s singles, as well as for the band&#x27;s 2002 compilation &quot;The Best of 1990-2000&quot;.

==Composition==

&quot;Pop&quot; features tape loops, programming, sequencing, sampling, and heavy, funky dance rhythms. The Edge said in U2&#x27;s fan magazine &quot;Propaganda&quot; that, &quot;It&#x27;s very difficult to pin this record down. It&#x27;s not got any identity because it&#x27;s got so many.&quot; Bono has said that the album &quot;begins at a party and ends at a funeral&quot;, referring to the upbeat and party-like first half of the album and sombre and dark mood of the second half. According to Flood, the production team worked to achieve a &quot;sense of space&quot; on the record&#x27;s sound by layering all the elements of the arrangements and giving them places in the frequency spectrum where they did not interfere with each other through the continual experimenting and re-working of song arrangements.

Clayton&#x27;s bass guitar was heavily processed, to the point that it sounded like a keyboard bass (an instrument utilized on &quot;Mofo&quot;). The Edge wanted to steer away from the image he had since the 1980s as having an echo-heavy guitar sound. As a result, he was enthusiastic about experimenting with his guitar&#x27;s sound, hence the distorted guitar sounds on the album, achieved with a variety of effects pedals, synthesisers and knob twiddling. Bono was very determined to avoid the vocal style present on previous (especially 1980s) albums, characterized by pathos, rich timbre, a sometimes theatrical quality and his use of falsetto singing: instead he opted for a rougher, more nervous and less timbre-laden style. The production team made his voice sound more intimate, as up-front and raw as possible. As Flood explained, &quot;You get his emotional involvement with the songs through the lyrics and the way he reacts to the music—without him having to go to 11 all the time... We only used extreme effects on his voice during the recording, for him to get himself into a different place, and then, gradually, we pulled most effects out.&quot;
&quot;Discothèque&quot;, the lead single, begins with a distorted acoustic guitar that is passed through a loud amplifier and a filter pedal, along with being processed through an ARP 2600 synthesizer. The song&#x27;s riff and techno dance rhythm are then introduced. The break in the song&#x27;s rhythm section features guitar sounds utilizing a &quot;Big Cheese&quot;, an effects pedal made by Lovetone. Writer John D. Luerssen noted that the song is &quot;often cited as U2&#x27;s first experiment with electronica,&quot; calling it &quot;a continuation of the experimentation the band had done on &quot;Zooropa&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Do You Feel Loved&quot;, which was considered for a single release, runs at a slower pace and features electronic elements. Bono said of the song: &quot;It&#x27;s quite a question, but there&#x27;s no question mark on it,&quot; as the band took the question mark off the title of the song for fearing it would be perceived as &quot;too heavy.&quot;

&quot;Mofo&quot; is the most overtly techno track on the record. Bono&#x27;s lyrics lament the loss of his mother. There are little guitar and vocal samples that the band played and the production team sampled. They selected the bits that they liked, and then Edge played them back in a keyboard. &quot;Pop&quot;&#x27;s producer Flood also put some of guitar work through the ARP 2600 on this track.

&quot;If God Will Send His Angels&quot; is a ballad with Bono pleading for God&#x27;s help. Like the other singles, the single version is different from the album version. Written on acoustic guitar, D. Leurssen described it as a &quot;techno-tinged ballad&quot;. Bono originally thought the song was too soft and asked to &quot;fuck it up,&quot; saying &quot;I thought, this is, like, pure. Now drop acid onto that.&quot;

&quot;Staring at the Sun&quot; features acoustic guitars and a distorted guitar riff from Edge, and a simple rhythm section from Mullen. The backing track was played to the ARP 2600 running in free time, playing an odd drum-like sequence.

&quot;Last Night on Earth&quot; is anthemic with fuzzy, layered guitars, a funk-inspired bass line, and vocal harmonies during the song&#x27;s bridge.

&quot;Gone&quot; features a &quot;siren&quot; effect from Edge&#x27;s guitar, complex krautrock style drums from Mullen and a funk-inspired bass line. This track was also considered for release as a single. Flood applied VCS3 spring reverb and ring modulation in a few places, and used it a lot on the basic rhythm track of this song.

&quot;Miami&quot; has a trip rock style. It begins with a drum loop, with Mullen&#x27;s hi-hats playing backwards through a very extreme equalization filter. Howie B explained, &quot;The main groove is actually just Larry&#x27;s hi-hat, but it sounds like a mad engine running or something really crazy – about as far away from a hi-hat as you can imagine... the task in &#x27;Miami&#x27; was to make it unlike anything else on the album, and also unlike anything else you&#x27;d ever have heard before.&quot; Edge also comes in with a frenetic guitar riff and Bono&#x27;s affected vocal style singing about Miami in metaphors and descriptions of loud, brash Americana. D. Leurssen described it as a &quot;sonic travelogue,&quot; while the Edge termed it &quot;creative tourism.&quot; In 2005, Q magazine included the song &quot;Miami&quot; in a list of &quot;Ten Terrible Records by Great Artists&quot;. However, Andrew Unterberger of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; acknowledged the inclusion of the song in Q&#x27;s list and said &quot;I’m pretty sure they gave this album some super-glowing review when it was first released, so clearly they’re not to be trusted in the first.&quot;

&quot;The Playboy Mansion&quot; starts out with mellow, wah-wah guitar playing from Edge. Along with Mullen&#x27;s drumming, there are breakbeats and hip-hop beats on the rhythm track, which were recorded as loops by Mullen. Howie described the loops thus; &quot;Larry went off into a side room and made some sample loops of him playing his kit, and gave the loops to me and Flood. It was the same with the guitars; there&#x27;s a guitar riff which comes in the verse and chorus, which is a sample of Edge playing.&quot; Bono&#x27;s lyrics are a tongue-in-cheek account of pop culture icons.

&quot;If You Wear That Velvet Dress&quot; features a mellow, dark atmosphere. Marius De Vries played keyboards on this track, contributing to the ambient feel. Mullen uses brush stroke style drums for the most part. When news first broke of U2&#x27;s work in the studio, it was reported the band were recording a trip hop album; writer Niall Stokes believes that &quot;The Playboy Mansion&quot; comes close to the assertion due to Hooper&#x27;s heavy hand. Flood stated that Hooper &quot;started things off&quot; but did not finish the track due to his time constraints. Bono reworked this song as a lounge-jazz piece for the 2002 Jools Holland album &quot;Small World Big Band Volume Two&quot;.

&quot;Please&quot; features Bono lamenting The Troubles and the Northern Irish peace process, pleading with the powers that be to &quot;get up off their knees&quot;. Mullen uses martial-style drumming, similar to &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;. Flood put guitar work through the ARP 2600 on the song. He explains, &quot;For ages the rhythm track played all the way through the track. It&#x27;s a fairly tight groove/bass thing, and then we suddenly decided to drop out the rhythm section in the middle and add a load of strings and these weird synthetic sounds at the end of that break.&quot; The single releases and live performances of the song were different from the album version, with more prominent guitar playing and a guitar solo to end the song.

&quot;Wake Up Dead Man&quot; began as an upbeat song from the &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; sessions in 1991. It evolved into a darker composition during the &quot;Zooropa&quot; sessions, but it was shelved until &quot;Pop&quot;. One of the band&#x27;s darkest songs, &quot;Wake Up Dead Man&quot; features Bono pleading with Jesus to return and save mankind, evident in the lyrics &quot;Jesus / Jesus help me / I&#x27;m alone in this world / And a fucked-up world it is too&quot;. It is also one of only a few U2 songs to include profanity.

==Release==

&quot;Pop&quot; was originally scheduled for a November 1996 release date, but after the recording sessions went long, the album was delayed until March 1997. This significantly cut into the band&#x27;s rehearsal time for the upcoming PopMart Tour that they had scheduled in advance, which impacted the quality of the band&#x27;s initial performances on tour. Though the band settled on the album name &quot;Pop&quot;, many working names and proposed titles for the album, including &quot;Discola&quot;, &quot;Miami&quot;, &quot;Mi@mi&quot;, &quot;Novelty Act&quot;, &quot;Super City Mania&quot;, &quot;YOU2&quot; and &quot;Godzilla&quot;, went as far as having artwork made for them, while the names &quot;Pop for Men&quot; and &quot;Pop Pour Hommes&quot; were also considered. &quot;Pop&quot; was dedicated to Bill Graham, one of the band&#x27;s earliest fans who died in 1996, famous for suggesting to Paul McGuinness that he become U2&#x27;s manager. As with &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;, it was also dedicated to the band&#x27;s production manager Anne Louise Kelly whose dedication message, &quot;4UALKXXXX&quot;, is hidden on the playing side of the CD where the matrix number is found.

On 26 October 1996, U2 became one of the earliest bands to fall victim to an internet leak when a Hungary-based fansite leaked clips of &quot;Discothèque&quot; and &quot;Wake Up Dead Man&quot;, creating a buzz which built quickly on the internet, as radio stations played the snippets as a means to introduce listeners to the album. The clips were traced back to Polygram, where an executive had shared a VHS tape with previews of the tracks to marketing managers worldwide; one writer said that &quot;from there it got into the hands of a label employee&#x27;s friend.&quot;

===Promotion===
On 12 February 1997, two weeks before the album was released, the band held a press conference in the lingerie section of a K-Mart department store in New York City to announce details for the PopMart Tour. On 26 April 1997, American television network ABC aired a one-hour prime time special about &quot;Pop&quot; and the PopMart Tour, titled &quot;U2: A Year in Pop&quot;. Narrated by actor Dennis Hopper, the documentary featured footage from the &quot;Pop&quot; recording sessions, as well as live footage from the opening PopMart show in Las Vegas, which took place the night before. The program received poor reception, ranking at 101 out of 107 programs aired that week, according to Nielsen ratings, and became the lowest rated non-political documentary in the history of the ABC network. Despite the low ratings, McGuinness appreciated the opportunity for the band to appear on network television in the first place, stating that the small audience for the television special was still a large audience for the band, as it was much larger than any audience that could be obtained by MTV.

===Singles===
&quot;Pop&quot; featured six international singles, the most the band has released for a single album. &quot;Do You Feel Loved&quot; and &quot;Gone&quot; were also considered for release.

The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Discothèque&quot;, was released on 3 February 1997 and was a huge dance and airplay success in the U.S. and UK. It also reached No. 1 in the singles charts of most of European countries including the United Kingdom, where it was their third No. 1 single. In the United States, &quot;Discothèque&quot; is notable for being U2&#x27;s only single since 1991 to crack the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at #10. However, the song&#x27;s dance elements and more humorous video (featuring U2 in a discothèque and even imitating The Village People) limited its appeal. This started a backlash against U2 and &quot;Pop&quot;, limiting sales, as many fans felt that the band had gone a bit too far over-the-top in the self-mocking and &quot;ironic&quot; imagery.

The follow-up single &quot;Staring at the Sun&quot; was released 15 April 1997 and became a Top 40 success in the U.S., but to a lesser extent, peaking at No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;Last Night on Earth&quot; was released as the third single on 14 July 1997, but did not crack the top 40, peaking at #57. &quot;Please&quot;, &quot;If God Will Send His Angels&quot;, and &quot;Mofo&quot; were subsequently released as singles, but none reached the Top 100.

The &quot;&quot;, featuring four live tracks from the PopMart Tour, was also released in most regions. In the United States, the four live tracks were instead released on the &quot;Please&quot; single, along with the single version of &quot;Please,&quot; itself.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Pop&quot; initially received favourable reviews from critics. Barney Hoskyns of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave &quot;Pop&quot; a four-star rating, praising the band&#x27;s use of technology on the album: &quot;U2 know that technology is ineluctably altering the sonic surface – and, perhaps, even the very meaning – of rock &amp; roll.&quot; The review also stated that U2 had &quot;pieced together a record whose rhythms, textures and visceral guitar mayhem make for a thrilling roller-coaster ride&quot; and that the band had &quot;defied the odds and made some of the greatest music of their lives&quot;. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a B rating, saying: &quot;Despite its glittery launch, the album is neither trashy nor kitschy, nor is it junky-fun dance music. It incorporates bits of the new technology – a high-pitched siren squeal here, a sound-collage splatter there – but it is still very much a U2 album&quot;. Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; rated &quot;Pop&quot; four-stars-out-of-four, judging the album to benefit &quot;from the tension of... competing influences, sometimes leaning more on the electronic currents, elsewhere showcasing the more melodic and accessible songwriting strengths&quot;. He praised the group&#x27;s musical experimentation, saying, &quot;It is such boldness that has enabled U2 to remain at the creative forefront of pop music for more than a decade.&quot; James Hunter of &quot;Spin&quot; rated the record 9/10, writing, &quot;&quot;Pop&quot; realizes a symphonic transcendence for which the band&#x27;s earlier stabs like &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; could only wish.&quot; He added, &quot;They are now experts at wringing genuine emotion, and even a few smirks, out of random sounds, letting their roots filter up from below.&quot; Bernard Zuel of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; praised the album&#x27;s understated tracks and the influence of Howie B, and said that the band avoided making the same mistake as rock counterparts of &quot;trying to slap a traditional bottom-end on top of a metronomic beat and calling it dance&quot;. He said that despite not being &quot;the future of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll&quot;, &quot;Pop&quot; was &quot;a genuine snapshot of its present by a band bright enough to keep exploring, smart enough not to abandon its past and big enough to make it palatable to radio programmers&quot; resistant to dance music.

Other reviews were more critical. Neil Strauss of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;From the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Boy&quot;, in 1980, through &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; in 1987, U2 sounded inspired. Now it sounds expensive.&quot; He further commented that &quot;U2 and techno don&#x27;t mix any better than U2 and irony do.&quot; Parry Gettelman of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; rated the album two stars and found the band&#x27;s attempt to merge rock music with dance rhythms underwhelming, saying, &quot;U2 lacks the zest for experimentation that has helped make electronic music so appealing to music fans weary of formulaic rock&quot;. John Sakamoto of &quot;Jam! Showbiz&quot; said, &quot;Far from an exercise in daring self-indulgence, &quot;Pop&quot; is too often guilty of a much more serious offence: not going far enough.&quot; He added, &quot;as with so many elements of the ephemeral culture it both disparages and celebrates, it ends up being something considerably less than has been advertised.&quot; &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau rated it a dud, indicating a bad album unworthy of a review.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Pop&quot; was initially a commercial success, debuting at number one in 27 countries, including the UK and the US. In its first week on sale, the record sold 349,000 copies in the US. In its second week in the US, the album&#x27;s sales fell 57 per cent, selling 150,000 copies. The record quickly dropped out of the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. &quot;Pop&quot;″s lifetime sales are among the lowest in U2&#x27;s catalogue. It was certified RIAA platinum once, the lowest since the band&#x27;s album &quot;October&quot;.

==PopMart Tour==
In support of the album, the band launched the PopMart Tour. Consisting of four legs and a total of 93 shows, the tour took the band to stadiums worldwide from April 1997 to March 1998. Much like the band&#x27;s previous Zoo TV Tour, PopMart was elaborately staged, featured a lavish set, and saw the band embrace an ironic and self-mocking image. The band&#x27;s performances and the tour&#x27;s stage design poked fun at the themes of consumerism and embraced pop culture. Along with the reduced rehearsal time that affected initial shows, the tour suffered from technical difficulties and mixed reviews from critics and fans over the tour&#x27;s extravagance. The PopMart Tour grossed US$171,677,024.

==Legacy==

Following the PopMart Tour, the band expressed their dissatisfaction with the final product. Between the album&#x27;s various singles and the band&#x27;s &quot;The Best of 1990–2000&quot; compilation (and disregarding dance remixes), the band re-recorded, remixed, and rearranged &quot;Discothèque&quot;, &quot;If God Will Send His Angels&quot;, &quot;Staring at the Sun&quot;, &quot;Last Night on Earth&quot;, &quot;Gone&quot;, and &quot;Please&quot;. Bono also recorded and issued a drastically different studio version of &quot;If You Wear That Velvet Dress&quot; with Jools Holland. Bono said: &quot;&quot;Pop&quot; never had the chance to be properly finished. It is really the most expensive demo session in the history of music.&quot; Although he reiterated his belief that the album was rushed, the Edge still viewed &quot;Pop&quot; as a &quot;great record,&quot; and said, &quot;I was very proud of it by the end of the tour. We finally figured it out by the time we made . It was an amazing show that I&#x27;m really proud of.&quot; In the same interview, Edge also stated: &quot;We started out trying to make a dance-culture record and then realized at the end there are things we can do that no EDM producer or artist can do, so let&#x27;s try and have it both ways. In that case, we probably went too far in the other direction. We probably needed to allow a bit more of the electronica to survive.&quot;

The band took a considerably more conservative, stripped down approach with &quot;Pop&quot;″s follow-up, &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; (2000), along with the Elevation Tour that supported it; &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; featured a &quot;more traditional U2 sound&quot;. The few songs from &quot;Pop&quot; that were performed on the Elevation Tour (&quot;Discothèque&quot;, &quot;Gone&quot;, &quot;Please&quot;, &quot;Staring at the Sun&quot;, and &quot;Wake Up Dead Man&quot;) were often presented in relatively bare-bones versions. On the Vertigo Tour, songs from &quot;Pop&quot; were even more rarely played; &quot;Discothèque&quot; was played twice at the beginning of the third leg, while other &quot;Pop&quot; songs appeared merely as snippets. No &quot;Pop&quot; songs appeared on the band&#x27;s U2 360° Tour, though the chorus and guitar riff of &quot;Discotheque&quot; did appear as a regular snippet during the &quot;dance&quot; remix of the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Go Crazy If I Don&#x27;t Go Crazy Tonight&quot; late in the tour. U2 did not play a single song from the album on their Innocence + Experience Tour in 2015, although &quot;Mofo&quot; was sampled twice in the earliest tour dates. &quot;Pop&quot; was the only U2 album that U2 did not play a single song from for the full duration of their tour. &quot;Staring at the Sun&quot; was performed live during U2&#x27;s 2018 Experience + Innocence Tour, which Andy Greene of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described as &quot;a rare onstage acknowledgment that &quot;Pop&quot; is a thing that happened.&quot; &quot;Pop&quot; was viewed as U2&#x27;s &quot;most neglected album&quot; with the band &quot;effectively [disowning] the record by purging its material from setlists.&quot;

Retrospectively, &quot;Pop&quot; is viewed in the music press and public as a disappointment. In a 2013 article, &quot;Spin&quot; was more critical of the album than in the magazine&#x27;s original review, calling it &quot;U2&#x27;s nadir period&quot; and a &quot;weirder, bolder, nervier record than its garish exterior would suggest... if you can tune out Bono&#x27;s mugging, which of course you can&#x27;t, which was the whole problem. The stupidity of all this subsumed the prescient bravery of it...&quot; Caryn Rose of &quot;Vulture&quot; said that &quot;A lengthy book could be written about the disaster that was &quot;Pop&quot; and the subsequent tour.&quot; Nonetheless, the album has been praised, including from Elvis Costello who included it in his 2000 list of &quot;500 Albums You Need&quot;, and from &quot;Hot Press&quot; which ranked the album at number 104 on their 2009 list of &quot;The 250 Greatest Irish Albums of All Time&quot;. Similarly, in 2003, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; included the album in their list &quot;Vital Pop: 50 Essential Pop Albums,&quot; with reviewer Sal Cinquemani saying &quot;the reason why &quot;Pop&quot; wasn&#x27;t a bigger hit in the U.S. is a mystery&quot; and said the record was &quot;better (and deeper) than anything on U2&#x27;s much-ballyhooed &#x27;return&#x27; to pop, &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot;.&quot; Bobby Olivier of &quot;Billboard&quot; believed that &quot;Pop&quot; was the band&#x27;s &quot;last legitimately courageous project,&quot; saying that &quot;all we see is a group that chose not to coast.&quot; In 2018, BBC included it on its list of &quot;acclaimed albums that nobody listens to any more&quot;.

In March 2018, U2 announced that &quot;Pop&quot; would be reissued and remastered on vinyl alongside &quot;Wide Awake in America&quot; (1985) and &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; (2000) on 13 April 2018.

<text>Operation Amherst was a Free French and British attack designed to capture intact Dutch canals, bridges and airfields during World War II. It was led by Brigadier Mike Calvert of Chindit fame.

==The battle==
The operation began with the drop of 700 French Special Air Service troopers of the 3rd and 4th SAS (French) on the night of 7 April 1945. The teams spread out to capture and defend key facilities from the Germans. Advancing Canadian troops of the 8th Reconnaissance Regiment relieved the isolated French SAS.

The majority of the French paratroopers were dropped over the north-western part of the province of Drenthe. Here they occupied a series of bridges and conducted hit and run attacks on the withdrawing German troops. A small group of paratroopers under the command of Captain Pierre Sicaud were dropped in south-east Friesland close to the border of Drenthe. Under the cover of heavy clouds, several sticks consisting of approximately 15 paratroopers each managed to land without being detected by the Germans. Captain Sicaud, however, landed in a pine tree and his eye was pierced by a branch, seriously limiting the use of his eye.

Some of the French paratroopers were discovered by a band of Dutch resistance fighters who had made their shelter in the vast forests south of the small village of Appelscha. Led by an agent of the Dutch government in exile in England, the paratroopers re-grouped and conducted a series of attacks on German troops retreating through the area to Germany.

Sicaud and his paratroopers occupied an important bridge, seriously frustrating German troop movements. A series of running battles between the French, the Germans, and Dutch Nazi collaborators were conducted near the bridge. The civilian population of Appelscha, after a relatively calm five years of German occupation, experienced five days of heavy fighting that left no civilian casualties but plenty of German dead.

One group of paratroopers was dropped too far from Captain Sicaud and ended up on the outskirts of the small village of Haulerwijk, ten kilometers north of Appelscha. German troops discovered the French in the early morning of 8 April and a firefight broke out between the French and the Germans. One French SAS trooper was killed, while some of the French were captured and some managed to flee and catch up with the French fighting in and around Appelscha.

Eventually, in disarray, the Germans managed to counterattack with the rest of their troop. Some SAS and civilians were killed, but the remaining SAS troops forced the Germans to withdraw. This mini battle was referred to as &quot;the last Amherst&quot; where part of the town was destroyed, and a huge conflict ensued.

<doc id="420302" wikidata="Q2628085" url="?curid=420302" title="Mechanical efficiency">
<text>In mechanical engineering, mechanical efficiency is a dimensionless ratio that measures the efficiency of a mechanism or machine in transforming the power input to the device to power output. A machine is a mechanical linkage in which force is applied at one point, and the force does work moving a load at another point. At any instant the power input to a machine is equal to the input force multiplied by the velocity of the input point, similarly the power output is equal to the force exerted on the load multiplied by the velocity of the load. The mechanical efficiency of a machine (often represented by the Greek letter eta &quot;η&quot;) is a dimensionless number between 0 and 1 that is the ratio between the power output of the machine and the power input

formula_1

Since a machine does not contain a source of energy, nor can it store energy, from conservation of energy the power output of a machine can never be greater than its input, so the efficiency can never be greater than 1.

All real machines lose energy to friction; the energy is dissipated as heat. Therefore, their power output is less than their power input

formula_2

Therefore, the efficiency of all real machines is less than 1. A hypothetical machine without friction is called an &quot;ideal machine&quot;; such a machine would not have any energy losses, so its output power would equal its input power, and its efficiency would be 1 (100%).

For hydropower turbines the efficiency is referred to as hydraulic efficiency.

British Commandos of No. 3 Commando, two troops of No. 2 Commando, a medical detachment of No. 4 Commando, a demolition party from 101 Troop (canoe) of No. 6 Commando, and a dozen Norwegians from Norwegian Independent Company 1 conducted the raid. The Royal Navy, led by the light cruiser , with the destroyers , , and , provided fire support. The submarine was in support as the force navigational check. and transported the troops. Also in support were Royal Air Force bombers and fighter-bombers.

==Objectives==
Central to the operation was the destruction of fish-oil production and stores which the Germans used in the manufacture of high explosives. Another intention was to cause the Germans to maintain and increase forces in Norway, which would reduce forces deployed on the Eastern Front, thereby giving a numerical advantage to Allied forces.

The commando force of 570 troops was divided into five parties to
# Secure the area north of the town of Måløy in South Vågsøy and engage any enemy reinforcements
# Subdue and secure Måløy town
# Eliminate the enemy on Måløy Island which dominated the town
# Eliminate the enemy strongpoint at Holvik west of Måløy
# Provide a floating reserve offshore

==Raid==
The dawn landing was preceded by a very effective naval bombardment and objectives were achieved, except in Måløy. German opposition in the town was much stiffer than expected as, unknown to the British, a &quot;Gebirgsjäger&quot; (mountain troops) unit of experienced troops from the Eastern Front was there on leave. The defenders&#x27; experience in sniping and street fighting caused the operation to develop into a bitter house-to-house battle. The British commander, John Durnford-Slater, called on the floating reserve and troops from Vågsøy Island. Several local citizens assisted the commandos by acting as porters for ammunition, grenades and other explosives and in carrying away the wounded.

At around 14:00, the commandos started their withdrawal having destroyed four factories, the fish-oil stores, ammunition and fuel stores, the telephone exchange and various military installations, leaving much of the town in flames. The naval assault force of one cruiser and four destroyers had sunk 10 vessels, some found in the act of being scuttled to prevent capture. Technical difficulties had prevented the German coastal artillery from being fully effective, with one of their three guns scoring one hit on the cruiser.
==Aftermath==
No Royal Navy ships were lost but the navy suffered four men killed and four wounded. The Commandos sustained 17 killed and 53 wounded. The commander of the Norwegian Independent Company 1, Captain Martin Linge, was killed in an attack on the local German headquarters and eight Royal Air Force aircraft were shot down. (A Norwegian civilian was hit by shrapnel during the raid, and died from the resulting injuries the following night). The commandos accounted for at least 120 defenders killed and returned with 98 prisoners and a complete copy of the German Naval Code. Captain O&#x27;Flaherty was hit by sniper fire and lost an eye, later wearing an eye-patch as a brigadier. Capt O&#x27;Flaherty can be seen in the image of &#x27;Wounded British Soldier&#x27; being helped by two fellow soldiers. The soldier with bayonet is Derek Page of No 3 Commando. the soldier on the left is Herbert Cecil Wright.

Several Quislings and over 70 loyal Norwegians (Jøssing) were also brought back. In conjunction with this raid, Operation Anklet was mounted by No. 12 Commando on the Lofoten Islands as a diversion. The raid was enough to persuade Adolf Hitler to divert 30,000 troops to Norway and to build more coastal and inland defences. Hitler thought that the British might invade northern Norway to put pressure on Sweden and Finland.

<text>All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind is the tenth studio album by Irish rock band U2. It was produced by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, and was released on 30October 2000 through Island Records and Interscope Records. Following the band&#x27;s experimentation with alternative rock and dance music in the 1990s and the mixed reception to their 1997 album, &quot;Pop&quot;, U2 returned to a sound more akin to their earlier records for &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot;. The group reunited with Eno and Lanois, who had produced three prior U2 albums together. The record was originally named &quot;U2000&quot;, which had been a working title for their PopMart Tour.

The album received positive reviews from most critics, reached number one in 32 countries, and sold over 12million copies. The songs &quot;Beautiful Day&quot;, &quot;Walk On&quot;, &quot;Elevation&quot;, and &quot;Stuck in a Moment You Can&#x27;t Get Out Of&quot; were all successful singles. The record and its songs won seven Grammy Awards; it is the only album in history to have multiple tracks win the Grammy Award for Record of the Year: &quot;Beautiful Day&quot; at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2001 and &quot;Walk On&quot; at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards in 2002. In 2003, the album was ranked 139th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, but it was re-ranked at number280 in 2012. The supporting Elevation Tour, on which the band returned to playing arenas with a more intimate stage design, was also a critical and commercial success. &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; was reissued in 2020 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of its original release.

==Background==
Throughout the 1990s, U2 experimented with alternative rock and electronic dance music, culminating with their 1997 album &quot;Pop&quot; and the accompanying PopMart Tour. Guitarist the Edge said that with &quot;Pop&quot;, the band had &quot;taken the deconstruction of the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band format to its absolute &#x27;nth degree.&quot; However, following the poor reception to the album and tour, the band wished to return to song arrangements that consisted almost entirely of guitar, bass, and drums, and to quickly regroup in the studio after the tour.

==Writing and recording==
For &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot;, U2 reunited with producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, who also produced their albums &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; (1984), &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; (1987), and &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; (1991). Although the band wanted to write new material before beginning recording sessions, Eno convinced them to quickly write songs in the studio. For three weeks in late 1998, U2, Eno, and Lanois recorded demos in Hanover Quay Studios. One of the few quality ideas that stemmed from these brief sessions was the song &quot;Kite&quot;. Lead singer Bono&#x27;s vocals inspired everyone in the studio, particularly after he had been suffering from vocal problems for the previous few years. U2 thought they would have a new record completed in time for 1999. After the band&#x27;s brief demo sessions, The Edge worked alone on song ideas before the band reunited at Hanover Quays. They recorded with the mentality of a &quot;band in a room playing together&quot;, an approach that led to the album&#x27;s more stripped-down sound. After mixing &quot;The Ground Beneath Her Feet&quot; in 2000, Tim Palmer was brought onto the team to mix some key songs for the record. Palmer mixed &quot;Elevation&quot; and &quot;New York&quot; in Dublin, and in Los Angeles he mixed &quot;Stuck in a Moment You Can&#x27;t Get Out Of&quot;.

Bono&#x27;s involvement in the Jubilee 2000 campaign prevented him from dedicating all of his time to the album&#x27;s recording, something Eno thought was a distraction. There was also a two-month break in the sessions when Bono collaborated with Lanois and Hal Wilner on &quot;The Million Dollar Hotel&quot; film soundtrack. The band had thought they could complete the album for 1999, but the sessions ran long, with band members&#x27; conflicting schedules playing a large part in the delay. U2 did not want to put a deadline on completing the album after their experience with &quot;Pop&quot;, which had to be rushed to completion in order to meet the deadline set by their pre-booked PopMart Tour.

In mid-1999, bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. bought houses in the South of France, in order to be near Bono and the Edge&#x27;s homes so they could have a place to both &quot;work and play&quot;. That year, a bag holding personal papers and a laptop computer containing lyrics for the album was taken from Bono&#x27;s car, which was parked outside Dublin&#x27;s Clarence Hotel, which is owned by Bono and The Edge. Bono offered a reward of £2,000 for the return of the computer. An Irish man returned the laptop after having bought it for £300 thinking it was from a reputable source. He realised it was Bono&#x27;s when he saw a picture of the singer&#x27;s son Elijah Hewson on the screen, prompting him to contact U2&#x27;s management.

The band have said that &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; was an album that acknowledged the band&#x27;s past. For example, there was a big debate amongst the band members during the writing and recording of &quot;Beautiful Day&quot;; The Edge was playing with a guitar tone that he had not used much since their 1983 album &quot;War&quot; and the band wanted something more forward-looking. The Edge won out and the tone made it into the final version of the song. Additionally, although the record was described as &quot;a return to the traditional U2 sound&quot;, many songs were complex and retained elements of the band&#x27;s 1990s experimentation; The introduction of &quot;Beautiful Day&quot; features an &quot;electronification of the [chorus] chords with a beat box and a string part&quot;; &quot;New York&quot; came together when the band members were away at a meeting and Lanois and Eno were playing around with a drum loop that Mullen had recorded.

==Composition==
The album was seen as a return to the band&#x27;s traditional sound after their more experimental records of the 1990s. In many ways, however, this is an oversimplification, as the album breaks new ground by retaining the sonic nuances of their 1990s work and reconciling it with the melodic, hook-filled rock of their 1980s work. The first song (and lead single), &quot;Beautiful Day&quot;, for instance, is an optimistic anthem that opens with a drum machine and a rhythm sequencer. The album also includes &quot;Stuck in a Moment You Can&#x27;t Get Out Of&quot;, a song written by Bono for his friend, lead singer of INXS, Michael Hutchence, who committed suicide in 1997. Clayton said the album was written &quot;about the journey we&#x27;d been through as a band, as men in relationships, as sons of mothers and fathers. It was about the baggage that you have to live with, the sense of loss, like the fact that Bono&#x27;s father was terminally ill through that whole period.&quot;

Musicologist Susan Fast says both this album and the follow-up &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot; (2004) find U2 returning to &quot;more &#x27;stripped down&#x27; rock and pop sounds&quot;. &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; writer Matt Gilmour has called it a &quot;pop-rock&quot; and &quot;classicist rock album – equal parts rhythm and blues, soul, rock and pop.&quot;

==Artwork==
The photograph on the album cover was taken by long-time U2 photographer Anton Corbijn in the Roissy Hall 2F of the Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France, which was also where the music video for &quot;Beautiful Day&quot; was shot. Contrasting with the colourful sleeves of the band&#x27;s 1990s records, the cover of &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; is a single monochrome image of the band. The designers describe the look they created as &quot;grown up&quot;. In the original photograph, an airport sign reads &quot;F21-36&quot;, indicating the direction of check-in desks. Per the band&#x27;s request, the sleeve designers changed this to J33-3, a hidden reference to the Bible verse Jeremiah 33:3 (&quot;Call unto me and I will answer thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not.&quot;). Bono referred to it as &quot;God&#x27;s phone number&quot;.

==Release and promotion==
Following the comparatively poor reception of their previous album &quot;Pop&quot;, U2 declared on a number of occasions that they were &quot;re-applying for the job ... of best band in the world.&quot; Promotional activities for the album included a number of U2 firsts such as appearances on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot;, USA Network&#x27;s &quot;Farmclub.com&quot;, and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The band kicked off the release of the album by performing a short concert for about 600 people at the ManRay club in Paris, France, on 19 October 2000, as part of the promotion for the 30 October release of the album. The album was banned in Burma by SPDC because &quot;Walk On&quot; was dedicated to Burmese human rights activist Aung San Suu Kyi.

The album was preceded by the lead single &quot;Beautiful Day&quot;, released on 9October 2000. It was U2&#x27;s fourth number-one single on the UK Singles Chart, their first number one in the Netherlands, and was also number one for a week in Australia. The song peaked at number21 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Stuck in a Moment You Can&#x27;t Get Out Of&quot;, was originally released on 29January 2001. It was also a success, reaching number two on the UK Singles Chart. In Canada and the United States, the song was released as the album&#x27;s final single later in the year.

A third single, &quot;Elevation&quot;, was first released in Australia on 25 June 2001 and received a UK release on 16 July 2001. The version of the song released as the single was the &quot;&quot;Tomb Raider&quot; Mix&quot;, which appeared in television commercials for the &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; movie. It features a much more hard rock arrangement than the album version, and it is this arrangement that the band plays live. The album&#x27;s fourth and final single, &quot;Walk On&quot;, was released in the UK on 19November 2001. This song served as the album&#x27;s second single in North America; in Canada, it was released in February 2001, while in the US, it was serviced to radio the following month. The song took on new meaning with listeners following the 11 September attacks.

==Reception==
===Critical reaction===
&quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 79, based on 17 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;. James Hunter of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine declared it &quot;U2&#x27;s third masterpiece&quot;, alongside &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; and &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the record &quot;as unwaveringly assured as &quot;Pop&quot; was tentative&quot; and said that it &quot;focuses on songs, not sonic gimmicks, and the difference is palpable&quot;. He concluded his review thusly: &quot;at a time when rock feels so earthbound, and dance-steeped albums like Moby&#x27;s &quot;Play&quot; provide the musical exaltation guitar bands once did, U2 simply want to reclaim some of that old stomping ground. In their hands, falling back on old habits isn&#x27;t cowardice, but a virtue.&quot; Steve Morse of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; said the record &quot;has great songs that tie together beautifully—a welcome change from the disjointed nature of U2 discs such as 1993&#x27;s &quot;Zooropa&quot; and 1997&#x27;s &quot;Pop&quot;&quot;. He believed that Bono took extra care in crafting the lyrics, resulting in the &quot;most thoughtful, personal, and tender U2 songs in memory&quot;. In his review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau felt that the album eschewed the artsier tendencies of U2&#x27;s previous work in favor of hooky pop songs and stated, &quot;The feat&#x27;s offhandedness is its most salient charm and nagging limitation. If I know anything, which with this band I never have, their best.&quot;

AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted U2&#x27;s return to &quot;the generous spirit that flowed through their best &#x27;80s records&quot; and called &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; &quot;a clever and craftsmanlike record, filled with nifty twists in the arrangements, small sonic details, and colors&quot;. &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Edna Gundersen wrote that the band had distilled their previous experimentation &quot;into smart accents and muted afterthoughts&quot;, resulting in a more organic record driven by &quot;simplicity and soul&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Adam Sweeting felt that they had &quot;grasped the value of simplicity&quot; and created their most accessible and emotional recording since &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;. While remarking that the record&#x27;s streamlined nature rendered it &quot;a teensy bit dull&quot;, April Long of &quot;NME&quot; nevertheless called &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; &quot;a laudable achievement&quot;. Stephen Thompson was less enthusiastic in his review for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; and found it inconsistent: &quot;In terms of execution, it splits about 50–50 between soaring hits and dispiriting misses.&quot; 

Reviewing the 20th anniversary re-release, Stephen Deusner of &quot;Uncut&quot; gave the album a seven out of 10, noting that the material falters in the last third; he gave the new material a six out of 10, calling the B-sides &quot;dull&quot; but praising the live tracks. The updated review from AllMusic notes that the remasters are the &quot;centrepiece&quot; of the re-release and that hardcore fans will appreciate the weirder collected B-sides; additionally, the packaging and photography from Corbijn are selling points.

===Commercial performance===
The album debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in the US, selling 427,826 copies in its first week. The album debuted at number one in 32 countries, including Canada where first-week sales totaled 71,470 copies. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album has sold 4.4 million copies in the US through March 2014. &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; is the fourth-highest-selling U2 album, with total sales of over 12 million.

===Accolades===
At the end of 2000, &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; was voted the seventh-best album of the year in the Pazz &amp; Jop annual critics poll published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. &quot;Beautiful Day&quot; finished fourth in the singles voting. &quot;Spin&quot; ranked it the 20th-best album of the year. The album and its singles earned U2 seven Grammy Awards over the course of two years. At the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2001, &quot;Beautiful Day&quot; won Song of the Year, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and Record of the Year. In the 44th Annual Grammy Awards in 2002, &quot;Walk On&quot; won Record of the Year, &quot;Elevation&quot; won Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and &quot;Stuck in a Moment You Can&#x27;t Get Out Of&quot; won Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. The album also won Best Rock Album and was nominated for Album of the Year. &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; is the only album ever to have two singles win Record of the Year in two consecutive years.

The accompanying Elevation Tour officially began on 24March 2001 with a two-night stay at the National Car Rental Center near Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and ended back in Miami, Florida, on 2December 2001 at the American Airlines Arena. The tour featured three legs and a total of 113 shows. The Elevation Tour saw U2 return to playing indoor arenas after they spent the 1990s in outdoor stadiums. The stage design of the Elevation Tour was more stripped-down and intimate for the fans. Many shows on tour sold out immediately. The band performed multiple concerts in certain cities, including four consecutive shows in Chicago, Boston, and London each. Globally, the Elevation Tour grossed US$143.5 million, making it the year&#x27;s highest-grossing tour.

==Legacy==
In 2003, &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; was ranked 139th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;; the magazine wrote that U2 &quot;brought things back to essentials&quot; with songs that &quot;grapple with mortality – particularly the gospel-soul ballad &#x27;Stuck in a Moment You Can&#x27;t Get Out Of&#x27; – and take on new resonance after September 11th&quot;. In 2012, the album was re-ranked at number280 on an updated version of the list. In 2009, it was ranked by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as the 13th-best album of the decade, while &quot;Beautiful Day&quot; was rated the ninth-best song. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Mojo&quot; ranked &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; 84th on its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Albums of Our Lifetime&quot;. In 2009, &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; ranked the record 62nd on its list of the top 100 albums of the previous decade. In 2014, &quot;PopMatters&quot; ranked the album 75th on its list of the best albums of the 2000s.

==20th anniversary edition==
On 30October 2020, &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; was reissued on CD, vinyl, and digitally in commemoration of its 20th anniversary. The album was remastered and released in Standard, Deluxe, and Super Deluxe editions, all of which include the song &quot;The Ground Beneath Her Feet&quot;, previously a bonus track, in the track listing. The Super Deluxe box set, containing 51 tracks, features: a 32-page book of photography by Anton Corbijn; B-sides and outtakes previously released on 2004&#x27;s &quot;Unreleased &amp; Rare&quot; and &quot;The Million Dollar Hotel&quot; soundtrack; complete audio from June 2001 performances in Boston (taken from the concert video &quot;Elevation 2001: Live from Boston&quot;); and 11 remixes, four of which were previously unreleased.

<doc id="420306" wikidata="Q2554277" url="?curid=420306" title="Operation Archway">
<text>Operation Archway was the codename for one of the largest and most diverse operations carried out by the Special Air Service during the Second World War.

Archway was initially intended to support Operation Plunder and Operation Varsity, the crossings of the River Rhine at Rees, Wesel, and south of the Lippe River by the British Second Army, under Lieutenant-General Sir Miles Dempsey. It went on to support the three British Armoured Divisions in their advance into Germany until the end of the war.

The Archway force was under command of Lieutenant Colonel Brian Franks and comprised two squadrons, one each from the 1st and 2nd Special Air Service.

==Background==
After the Normandy Landings the 1st and 2nd Special Air Service or SAS were involved in a number of operations in France, to support the Allied advance, notably Operation Bulbasket, Operation Houndsworth, Operation Loyton and Operation Wallace. Following these operations both of the Special Air Service regiments were recalled to the United Kingdom to regroup, both having suffered casualties in the French operations.

==Mission==
Operation Archway was planned to support the XVIII Airborne Corps Operation Varsity parachute landings across the Rhine river. The force from the Special Air Service would be known as Frankforce. Named after the officer selected to command it, the commanding officer of 2nd Special Air Service, Lieutenant Colonel Brian Franks. Frankforce was made up of two reinforced Special Air Service squadrons, one each from the 1st and 2nd Special Air Service regiments.
The force would number about 300 all ranks, mounted in 75 armed Jeeps, some also equipped with 3-inch mortars. They were supported by a number of 15-cwt and 3-ton trucks. The 1st Special Air Service squadron was led by Major Poat and consisted of three troops, each consisting of three sections with three Jeeps. They had a 3 in. mortar section at Squadron Headquarters which also kept a reserve of 12 Jeeps. The 2nd SAS squadron under command Major Power had a similar composition but only two troops.

Their first mission in support of the XVIII Airborne Corps consisted of reconnaissance patrols in northern Germany. They crossed the Rhine in amphibious LVT Buffalos, on the 25 March at Bislich.

Frankforce was then assigned to support the British Guards Armoured Division in the area around the Dortmund–Ems Canal. After this, until the end of the war, Frankforce worked with the 2nd Welsh Guards, the 8th King&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars and the 15th/19th The King&#x27;s Royal Hussars, who were the armoured reconnaissance regiments of the Guards, 7th and 11th Armoured Divisions. The Special Air Service Jeeps being a faster and lighter alternative to the Cromwell tanks used by the armoured regiments.
It was the 1st SAS squadron working with the 11th Armoured Division, who were among the first British troops into Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. They found between 50,000 and 60,000 inmates in the camp and for several days later SAS patrols assisted the Field Security Police in hunting down war criminals making several arrests. By the end of April 1945, they had reached the Elbe river, where they were joined by the Operation Keystone team, which was a squadron from 2nd SAS, under command of Major Hibbert.

==Aftermath==
At the end of the war in Europe, both the 1st and 2nd Special Air Service regiments had returned to the United Kingdom in preparation to be redeployed to the Far East in the fight against the Japanese Empire. Before any training could start, both regiments together with the 1st Airborne Division were sent to disarm the German garrison in Norway Operation Doomsday. In August 1945 the Special Air Service regiments returned home from Norway, and in October 1945 they were officially disbanded. The British Authorities of the time could see no further use for such a force.

<text>Wayne Hughes is a New Zealand former Pentecostal minister. Until early 2005, he was the senior pastor of the Takapuna Assembly of God in Auckland. A photographer by training, Hughes became pastor of the Takapuna Assembly of God in 1975. Under his leadership spanning three decades, it grew from 25 members to about 1600 adherents as of 2005. About a third of these are formal members.

As well as pastoring the Takapuna Assembly of God, Hughes also served as General Superintendent of the Assemblies of God in New Zealand from 1985 to 2003, when he resigned to give undivided attention to building his local church, which has set a goal of ten thousand members, and to care for his wife, Glenice, who has long suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

In March 2005, Hughes entered the media spotlight with accusations that he had sexually abused a teenager in the 1980s. In April 2005, he opted to retire early, citing health reasons plus a desire to protect the church from negative media publicity, and in May he surrendered his credentials as a minister and withdrew from all ministry in the church. In public statements, he has denied the charges, but on legal advice has refrained from giving specifics.

As a preacher, Hughes had a strong fundamentalist message and an emphasis on evangelism. Hughes strongly opposes pre-marital sex, abortion, pornography, and gambling, factors that he saw as contributing to the breakdown of &#x27;Christian morality&#x27;. He did not publicly endorse any particular political party, although he frequently did speak out against what he saw as the &#x27;godless values&#x27; of leading politicians. His focus was more on Christian living than on politics, and his sermons focused largely on building Christian character.

Hughes had a close relationship with the Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola, Florida, and the Yoido Full Gospel Church in Seoul, Korea. Dr Michael Brown and Rev. Steven Hill, both instrumental in the Brownsville Revival, and Dr David Yonggi Cho, of Yoido, hosted major conferences in New Zealand under Wayne Hughes&#x27;s auspices.

Hughes has three sons, two daughters, and a granddaughter. His younger daughter, Angela is also an ordained minister, and served as the Youth Pastor of her father&#x27;s church until late 2006.

Hughes was succeeded in the position of General Superintendent of the Assemblies of God in NZ by Ken Harrison.

<doc id="420309" wikidata="Q266618" url="?curid=420309" title="Flag of Prince Edward Island">
<text>The flag of Prince Edward Island consists of a golden lion passant on a red field in the upper portion and a white field charged with three oak saplings and a large oak tree on a green island in the bottom portion. This is bordered on three edges other than the hoist by a fimbriation of alternating red and white rectangles. Adopted in 1964 in the run-up to the Canadian Centennial, it has been the flag of the province since March 24 of that year. It is a banner of arms modelled after the province&#x27;s coat of arms. When flown with the flags of other Canadian provinces and the national flag, it is eighth in the order of precedence.

==History==
The French first settled in modern-day Prince Edward Island during the 1720s and named it Île Saint-Jean. The Treaty of Paris of 1763 saw France permanently relinquish the island to the United Kingdom. It was consequently placed under the administration of the Colony of Nova Scotia and its name was anglicized to St. John’s Island. The territory became a separate colony in 1769, and was accorded its own seal on July 14 of that same year. It featured an oak tree with three adjacent smaller trees. The island was renamed in 1799 to honour Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, who was the commander of the British forces in North America and garrisoned in nearby Halifax at the time.

Responsible government was accorded to Prince Edward Islanders in 1851. The territory hosted the Charlottetown Conference in 1864, which culminated in Canadian Confederation three years later on July 1, 1867, between the Province of Canada (consisting of modern-day Ontario and Quebec), Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. Although the island was consequently dubbed the &quot;Cradle of Confederation&quot;, it initially opted not to join due to lack of popular support. However, major economic troubles on the island led it to reconsider and eventually acquiesce to confederation. It officially joined the Dominion of Canada exactly six years later on July 1, 1873. Subsequently, King Edward VII issued a Royal Warrant on May 30, 1905, allowing Prince Edward Island to utilize their own coat of arms. The shield was derived from the Great Seal of 1769, with the addition of a gold lion on a red chief.

In the time leading up to the Canadian Centennial in 1967, Conrad Swan – the first Canadian to be appointed to the College of Arms in London – was invited to design a flag for Prince Edward Island. He created an armorial banner based on the province&#x27;s coat of arms and included a fimbriation of alternating red and white rectangles on the outer three sides of the flag. The Act of Legislature that tabled this flag received royal assent on March 24, 1964.

In a 2001 online survey conducted by the North American Vexillological Association, Prince Edward Island&#x27;s flag ranked within the top third of state, provincial and territorial flags from Canada, the United States, and select current and former territories of the United States. It finished in 21st place out of 72, and placed fifth among official Canadian flags after Quebec, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, and New Brunswick.

==Design==
===Description===
The flag of Prince Edward Island is described in detail in the &quot;Provincial Flag Act&quot;, provincial legislation that has been in force from March 24, 1964. It specifies the flag is to have an aspect ratio of 2:3. The blazon for the arms – as outlined in the letters patent registering it with the Canadian Heraldic Authority (CHA) on July 15, 2011 – reads, &quot;Argent on an island Vert, to the sinister an oak tree fructed, to the dexter thereof three oak saplings sprouting all proper, on a chief Gules a lion passant guardant Or&quot;. The flag itself was registered with the CHA on November 15, 2010. The fimbriation of alternating red and white bands consists of rectangles measuring in length and in height.

===Symbolism===

The colours and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. According to vexillologist Whitney Smith, the gold lion in the upper part of the flag – corresponding to the one on the Royal Arms of England – alludes to the English heritage of the early colonists to Prince Edward Island. It also evokes the coat of arms of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, who is the namesake of the island. The large oak tree on the right symbolizes England, while the three oak saplings on the left epitomize the three counties that constitute the province (namely Kings County, Queens County, and Prince County). The green island on which these trees are planted on represents Prince Edward Island and Great Britain, which are both islands. Taken altogether, the trees tie in with the province&#x27;s motto of &quot;Parva sub ingenti&quot; (&quot;the small under the protection of the great&quot;, from the second book of the &quot;Georgics&quot; by Virgil). The island was historically a small colony of the British Empire, as well as the smallest Canadian province by area. The three oak saplings are therefore interpreted in &quot;Complete Flags of the World&quot; by DK as the &quot;descendants&quot; of the British oak tree and are guarded by the British lion.

The oak tree on Prince Edward Island&#x27;s coat of arms (and by extension, its flag) is surmised to be &quot;Quercus rubra&quot; (red oak). This was adopted as the provincial tree in 1987. However, it has not been officially identified as such with regard to the arms.

==Protocol==
Advice regarding flag etiquette is the responsibility of the province&#x27;s Office of Protocol, specifically the Chief of Protocol. When flown together with the flag of Canada and the other provincial and territorial flags, the flag of Prince Edward Island is eighth in the order of precedence (after the national flag and, in descending order of precedence, the flags of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, and British Columbia). This is because it was the seventh province to enter into Confederation. Within Prince Edward Island, the provincial flag is third in the order of precedence, after the personal standard of a member of the Royal Family, the Governor General, or the province&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor, as well as the national flag. Under section 3 of the &quot;Provincial Flag Act&quot;, the utilization of the flag in a way that is prohibited by the Lieutenant Governor-in-Council is a summary offence that is punishable by a maximum fine of C$50 for the first instance and a maximum of $500 for every offence thereafter.

In addition to the dates set out by the federal government for flying flags at half-mast, the provincial flag is half-masted upon the death of the Lieutenant Governor or premier (either an incumbent or a previous one), as well as the incumbent speaker of the legislative assembly, member of the executive council, and federal members of parliament (MPs) and senators who represent the province. It may also be flown in such a manner when an individual honoured by Prince Edward Island dies. The flag may be draped over the casket of an individual who was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces or who served in public office. When utilized in this situation, the flag should measure by and be placed with the canton covering the left end of the coffin.

The guidelines also state that the flag is not to touch the ground, nor should it be used to cover a table or seat. It ought to be hoisted at sunrise and lowered before sunset, unless the flag is illuminated by floodlight throughout the night. The provincial flag should not be flown on the same flagpole that displays another flag. The only exception to this is if the other flag is the banner of an organization, in which case it is to be flown underneath the flag of Prince Edward Island if individual flagpoles are not available. It is not to be employed at an unveiling ceremony to cover a statue, monument, or plaque, nor should it be situated between the ground tier and platform tier at the front of a stage.

<doc id="420310" wikidata="Q485338" url="?curid=420310" title="Yoido Full Gospel Church">
<text>Yoido Full Gospel Church () is a Pentecostal church affiliated with the Assemblies of God on Yeouido (Yoi Island) in Seoul, South Korea. With about 480,000 members, it is the largest Pentecostal Christian congregation in South Korea. Founded by David Yonggi Cho and Choi Ja-shil in 1958, the church is presently led by Young Hoon Lee. The church has several satellite locations throughout the city of Seoul. The current building, relocated in 1973, was constructed by Sampoong Construction Industries, the company that built the Sampoong Department Store.

==History==
The Yoido Full Gospel Church was founded in 1958 by Pastor David Yonggi Cho and his mother-in-law, Choi Ja-shil, both Assemblies of God pastors. On 15 May 1958, a worship service was held in the home of Choi Ja-shil. Apart from the two pastors, only Choi Ja-shil&#x27;s three daughters (one of whom later married David Yungi Cho) and one elderly woman, who had come in to escape from the rain, attended the first service. The two pastors began a vigorous campaign of knocking on doors, providing spiritual and humanitarian help to the poor, and praying for the sick. Within months, the church had grown to fifty members, too many to accommodate in Choi Ja-shil&#x27;s living room. Worship services were accordingly moved to a tent pitched in her backyard. As the church continued to grow over the following months and years, the church outgrew one tent after another.

Pastor Cho began preaching on the Three-Fold Blessing (the blessing of the spirit, soul, and body), proclaiming that physical health and financial prosperity are as much a part of God&#x27;s will for Christians as the salvation of the soul. Inspired by his message of hope and monetary wealth, many previously uncommitted people joined the church, and by the beginning of 1961, membership had grown to a thousand. Having grown too large for its tent, the church purchased its first plot of land, at Seodaemun.

===The Seodaemun Church: 1961–1973===

The church&#x27;s plans for expansion suffered a setback when Pastor Cho was called up for mandatory military service. Fortunately for the church, he was assigned to an American Army base near Seoul, allowing him to continue with his Sunday preaching, with the help of John Hurston, an American missionary. Cho&#x27;s spell in the army was short, as ill-health required a major operation and a subsequent discharge from the army. Although ill, Cho continued to pastor the church, and on 15 October 1961, an inaugural service was held in the new auditorium that had been built on the plot of land the church had purchased at Seodaemun. It was named the Full Gospel Revival Center.

Church membership continued to grow, reaching three thousand by 1964 and eight thousand by 1968. Cho continued to be plagued by ill health, and he suffered a physical collapse while leading a baptismal service one Sunday. In 1967, Cho decided to restructure the church. Cho divided the city of Seoul into zones, with church members in each zone comprising a &quot;cell&quot; that would meet on a weekday for worship and Bible study in the home of a &quot;cell leader.&quot; Cell members were encouraged to invite their friends to attend cell meetings to learn about Jesus Christ. Each cell leader was instructed to train an assistant. When cell membership reached a certain number, it would be divided, with about half of its members joining the new cell led by the person who had been the assistant.

Cho believed that women would make ideal cell leaders, having both the time and the desire to make home visits to other members, something that many men, for reasons pertaining to Korean culture as it was at that time, were unwilling to do. His decision to appoint women as cell leaders went against the grain of Korean culture, which at that time was not open to the idea of women leading groups that had male members. He persisted, and the cell concept turned out to be an outstanding success. From 125 cells in 1967, the church has grown to several thousand cells in 2015.

Aside from restructuring as a cell-based church, a Women&#x27;s Fellowship was started in 1960, followed by a Men&#x27;s Fellowship in 1963, to enable lay members to serve the church in a wide range of volunteer capacities.

Membership continued to grow rapidly, reaching ten thousand in the early 1970s. Having outgrown its Seodaemun premises, the church began looking for a new place to build.

===The Yoido Church: 1973–present===
Yeouido (Yoi Island), in the middle of the Han River which winds its way through the heart of Seoul, was at that time little more than sand dunes, without even a bridge to connect it to the city of Seoul. Believing that he had heard from God, Cho and the other leaders of the church decided to purchase a plot of land on Yoi Island, directly across from Korea&#x27;s National Assembly. Economic problems, including the 1973 &quot;oil shock,&quot; which led to spiraling inflation and the loss of jobs for many church members, delayed construction of the new auditorium. However, it was finally finished in 1973, and its inaugural worship service in the auditorium of 12,000 seats was held on 19 August of that year. A month later, Full Gospel Central Church, as it was now known, hosted the 10th Pentecostal World Conference at the Hyochang Stadium.

Membership of Full Gospel Central Church reached fifty thousand by 1977, a figure that doubled in only two years. A special worship service was held to celebrate this milestone, with Demos Shakarian, President of the Full Gospel Businessmen&#x27;s Fellowship International as the guest speaker.

Beginning in the 1980s, Full Gospel Central Church decided to establish satellite churches throughout the city of Seoul and further afield, as it would not be able to keep on expanding indefinitely. Despite the expansion of the auditorium to seat 12,000 in 1983, seven Sunday services were insufficient to accommodate the entire membership. In 1993, with 700,000 members, the Yoido Full Gospel Church, was the world&#x27;s largest congregation recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records. Despite the drain of members to the satellite churches, however, new recruits by the mother church – brought in through the vast cell network – have made up for the losses, and membership stood at 780,000 in 2003. The church was renamed Yoido Full Gospel Church in the 1990s. Its founder, Mr David Yonggi Cho, retired as head pastor several times, but the church ran into immediate infighting among the remaining ministers, causing him to come out of retirement, most recently late in 2006. As of 2007, membership stands at 830,000, with seven Sunday services translated into 16 languages.

On 9 January 2009 a Sunday church service was featured in a BBC documentary &quot;Around the World in 80 Faiths&quot;.

In 2008, Young Hoon Lee became senior pastor.

In 2020, the Church had 480,000 people in Seoul.

==Ministries of the church==
Yoido Full Gospel Church has established many ministries as part of its outreach program, both locally and internationally. A representative sample of them follows:

*In March 1973, the Osanri Choi Ja-sil Memorial Fasting Prayer Mountain was founded. It has over 200 prayer grottoes in which people may lock themselves to fast and pray, Prayer Mountain now receives more than a million visitors a year, including some 50,000 foreigners.
*In November 1976, Church Growth International, an organization dedicated to teaching the principles of evangelism and church growth to pastors all over the world, was established.
*A ten-story World Evangelical Center, an educational institution attached to the church, was opened on 20 January 1977.
*A television studio, opened on 31 December 1981, was built to broadcast the worship services both nationally and internationally.
*The Full Gospel Educational Research Institute, now the International Theological Institute, was created to promote evangelism and theological training.
*In January 1986, Elim Welfare Town, a facility for the elderly, the young, the homeless, and the unemployed, was set up under the auspices of the church. The latter would be given training and a choice of four occupations. In March of the same year, the church established Hansei University.
*Since 2012, anticipating that the low birthrate issue would escalate into a national crisis, the church took immediate action by implementing measures to address it. As the first in the Korean church community, they began providing childbirth incentives to members who had children, distributing a total of 5.4 billion won up until last year. Starting in 2024, the church has increased the incentives, offering 2 million won for the first child, 3 million won for the second, 5 million won for the third, and 10 million won for the fourth child and beyond.
*In 2024, as Yoido Full Gospel Church celebrates its 66th anniversary, it has appointed its first six female elders. Following the church&#x27;s ongoing efforts to strengthen the role of women, this comes after the appointment of female pastors in 2023. Now, women are being given the opportunity to participate in the church&#x27;s leadership as elders, representing the laity in church administration.
*Yeouido Full Gospel Church has proclaimed special prayer meetings and early morning prayer gatherings during critical moments in South Korea&#x27;s modern history, overcoming challenges through the collective prayers of its congregation.

=== Overseas mission work ===
Yoido Full Gospel Church has sent missionaries to countries worldwide, spreading the &quot;Fivefold Gospel,&quot; &quot;Triple Blessing,&quot; and the Holy Spirit movement. Overseas missions officially began in 1964 with Pastor Cho Yong-gi&#x27;s mission work in the United States and have since expanded across continents. Today, the church has sent 657 missionaries to 63 countries, establishing 1,218 churches and guiding over 140,000 people in faith.

==Controversies==
===Buddhist temple vandalism===
A pastor from Yoido Full Gospel Church named Seong vandalized the Dharma hall of Donghwasa Temple on 20 August 2012. The pastor was caught on CCTV urinating in the Dharma hall and vandalizing the Buddhist portraits with a permanent marker.

===Embezzlement conviction===
On 20 February 2014 Pastor Cho and his son (Hee-jun) were convicted of embezzling US$12 million in church funds. The presiding judge once told Cho, &quot;We know that this case is not your problem. You just need to blame it on your son, then you will have no responsibilities,&quot; Cho wrote, adding that Cho refused, &quot;My son can be unrighteous to me, but I cannot be unrighteous to my son.&quot;
In June 2016, this incident became a non-prosecution because there was &quot;no suspicion.&quot;

=== Support for Pastor Jeon Kwang-hoon ===
Young Hoon Lee, who has served as the senior pastor of Yoido Full Gospel Church since 2008, sparked controversy on May 16, 2023, when he attended the opening ceremony of the Liberty Korea Party&#x27;s headquarters in Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul. During the event, he urged attendees to support Jeon Kwang-hoon in his call to &quot;eradicate communist reds,&quot; a phrase now regarded as outdated propaganda. The controversy is heightened by the fact that Jeon, whom Pastor Lee supported, has previously made statements like &quot;God, Freeze!&quot; which are seen as blasphemous by the Christian community. Additionally, Jeon has already been labeled a &quot;heretic&quot; by mainstream Protestant groups in South Korea. The incident has drawn criticism, as it appears that the leader of Korea&#x27;s largest church is publicly endorsing a figure deemed heretical by many within the faith.

=== David Yonggi Cho&#x27;s affair allegations ===
In November 2013, the Church Reform Prayer Meeting exposed allegations of an affair involving David Yonggi Cho, revealing that Cho had allegedly given 1.5 billion won to Jeong Gwi-sun, author of the novel Butterfly Lady of Paris, as hush money. Despite forming a &#x27;Church Investigation Committee,&#x27; the inquiry did not address the affair allegations, leaving many questions unanswered. Jeong Gwi-sun, identified as the alleged mistress, supported David Yonggi Cho. In January 2014, Jeong Gwi-sun claimed that the controversial book was fictional and unrelated to Cho, and sued six elders from the prayer meeting. On February 14, Jeong Gwi-sun publicly apologized to the Korean church, Yoido Full Gospel Church, Rev. Cho, and its members for the controversy.

<text>The Hooters is an American rock band, which was founded in Philadelphia in 1980. They combine elements of rock, reggae, ska, and folk music.

The Hooters first gained major commercial success in the United States in the mid-1980s due to heavy radio airplay and MTV rotation of several songs, including &quot;All You Zombies&quot;, &quot;Day by Day&quot;, &quot;And We Danced&quot;, and &quot;Where Do the Children Go.&quot; In 1985, the band played at the Live Aid benefit concert in Philadelphia. In Europe, the Hooters had success with the singles &quot;All You Zombies&quot; and &quot;Johnny B&quot;, and the band&#x27;s breakthrough across Europe came with the single &quot;Satellite.&quot; In 1990, the band played at The Wall Concert in Berlin.

The Hooters have staged successful tours in Europe. In 2007, the band released its first album of new material since 1993, &quot;Time Stand Still.&quot; The band&#x27;s most recent album, &quot;Rocking &amp; Swing&quot;, was released in 2023.

==Career==
===Early years (1980–1984)===
Rob Hyman and Eric Bazilian met in 1971 at the University of Pennsylvania. In the late 1970s, they played in a Philadelphia-based band called Baby Grand, which featured local singer David Kagan. Baby Grand released two albums on Arista Records.

In 1980, the Hooters were formed by Hyman and Bazilian. The band played their first show on July 4 that year. They took their name from a nickname for the melodica, a type of keyboard harmonica.

During the early 1980s, the Hooters played on Philadelphia&#x27;s club scene, boosted by airplay on WMMR, a major rock radio station in Philadelphia. Their music was also played frequently on WRDV-FM in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. They soon became a huge success along their native United States, playing everything from clubs to high schools, while appearing on local television shows. The original versions of &quot;Man in the Street&quot;, &quot;Fightin&#x27; on the Same Side&quot;, &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, and &quot;All You Zombies&quot; were released as singles in the 1980s.

On September 25, 1982, the Hooters opened for one of The Who&#x27;s farewell tour concert shows at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia on a bill that also included The Clash and Santana.

In 1983, John Kuzma (guitar) and Bobby Woods (bass) left the band. They were replaced by John Lilley (guitar, backing vocals) and Rob Miller (bass, backing vocals), two former members of another popular local group, Robert Hazard and the Heroes.

Later in 1983, the Hooters began working on their first album. The result, &quot;Amore&quot;, was released on the independent label Antenna and sold over 100,000 copies. &quot;Amore&quot; included &quot;All You Zombies&quot;, &quot;Hanging on a Heartbeat&quot;, &quot;Fightin&#x27; On The Same Side&quot;, and &quot;Blood From A Stone&quot;, all of which would reappear in different versions on later albums. Although a studio album, &quot;Amore&quot; captured the same energy and spirit that made the Hooters admired for their live performances.

The same year, Bazilian and Hyman were asked to write, arrange, and perform on the debut album of a relatively unknown singer named Cyndi Lauper, &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot;, which was being produced by their former producer and friend, Rick Chertoff. Hyman co-wrote the song &quot;Time After Time&quot; (and also sang the lower harmony vocal in the choruses), which went to hit Number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Singles Chart and was subsequently nominated for a Grammy Award for Song of the Year.

On July 26, 1984, at the Four Seasons Hotel in Philadelphia, Columbia Records signed the Hooters to their first major recording contract.

In 1984, WMMR, a nationally renowned Philadelphia rock music station, sponsored a school spirit contest where local high school students were asked to send in the postcard to the station. The school with the most postcards would win a free concert by the band. The radio station received over 26 million postcards. After allegations of fraud that resulted in rioting as well as a series of lawsuits, no winner was declared and the concert never took place.

Just before the band were about to experience mainstream success, bassist Rob Miller was seriously injured in an automobile accident and was replaced by Andy King.

===Mainstream success (1985–1989)===
The Hooters&#x27; debut album, &quot;Nervous Night&quot;, released in 1985 on Columbia Records, achieved 2× platinum status in the United States, selling in excess of two million copies and included &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 hits &quot;Day By Day&quot; (No. 18), &quot;And We Danced&quot; (No. 21) and &quot;Where Do the Children Go&quot; (No. 38), the latter which featured accompanying vocals from Patty Smyth and was inspired by a news report about a series of suicides in Pennsylvania. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named the Hooters &quot;Best New Band of the Year&quot;.

On July 13, 1985, the Hooters were the opening band at the Philadelphia Live Aid benefit concert, gaining international recognition for the first time. Bob Geldof said that he did not see the Hooters as a high-profile band suitable for Live Aid but that the band was forced on him by Bill Graham, promoter of Live Aid in the U.S. Geldof let his feelings be known during an interview for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; saying: &quot;Who the fuck are the Hooters?&quot; The Hooters&#x27; performance at Live Aid, however, does not appear on the officially released DVD of the concert. Their first major overseas tour came later that year when they played throughout Australia.

On May 18, 1986, the Hooters participated in America Rocks, the concert portion of the 1986 Kodak Liberty Ride Festival that celebrated the restoration of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. The three-hour concert was broadcast via satellite to 100 cities and also featured the Neville Brothers, Huey Lewis and the News, and Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates.

On June 15, 1986, the Hooters participated in A Conspiracy of Hope, a benefit concert on behalf of Amnesty International, at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. On September 5, 1986, the Hooters appeared on the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards, where they were nominated in the category of Best New Artist for &quot;And We Danced.&quot; They performed two songs on the show, &quot;And We Danced&quot; and &quot;Nervous Night.&quot;

At &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s 8th Annual Video Music Conference on November 22, 1986, the Hooters won two awards: Best Concert Performance for the &quot;Where Do the Children Go&quot; video and Best Longform Program for the full length &quot;Nervous Night&quot; home video. They also placed in five categories in Billboard&#x27;s Top 100 of 1986: Top Pop Artist, No. 41; Top Pop Album, No. 23; Top Pop Album Artists/Groups, No. 16; Top Pop Album Artists based on one album, No. 27; and Top Pop Singles Artists based on three singles, No. 3.

In 1987, the Hooters experienced their first major commercial success in Europe. After heavy airplay in the United Kingdom, &quot;Satellite&quot;, from the album &quot;One Way Home&quot;, became a hit single, reaching No. 22 in the UK Singles Chart. The band performed on the popular British television show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on December 3, where they met one of their musical idols, Paul McCartney. The song proved controversial, however, for its satire of the excesses of televangelism. &quot;Satellite&quot; was also featured in an episode of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, titled &quot;Amen...Send Money&quot;, which first aired on October 2, 1987, dealing with two warring televangelists. The accompanying video went even further, depicting a young girl and her parents, who resemble the couple from Grant Wood&#x27;s &quot;American Gothic&quot; painting, attempting to watch &quot;The Three Stooges&quot; interspersed with the Hooters performing, but being constantly interrupted by transmissions from a Christian show. Although never officially confirmed, the video contained barely concealed parodies of famous Christian televangelists Tammy Faye Bakker, Jerry Falwell, and Oral Roberts. On the tour supporting &quot;One Way Home&quot;, Fran Smith Jr. (bass, backing vocals) was brought in to replace Andy King, who left the band to pursue other interests.

On November 24, 1987, Thanksgiving night, the Hooters headlined the Spectrum in Philadelphia for the first time. The show was broadcast live on MTV and the Westwood One radio network simultaneously, the second time, after Asia on December 6, 1983, that the two networks joined forces in producing a concert for one artist.

In 1989, the Hooters issued their final album for Columbia Records, &quot;Zig Zag&quot;, which was introduced as politically oriented theme, with Peter, Paul and Mary providing background vocals for an updated version of the 1960s folk song &quot;500 Miles&quot;, which became an international hit.

===International success (1990–1995)===

In the 1990s, the Hooters&#x27; success in the United States began to wane, while their popularity overseas, especially in Europe, reached new heights. Following a show at The Town &amp; Country Club in London in March 1988, the band met Roger Waters of Pink Floyd, who told them that he was a fan. This eventually led to their appearance in Waters&#x27; staging of The Wall Concert at Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, on July 21, 1990.

Violinist, guitarist, and multi-instrumentalist Mindy Jostyn, formerly with Joe Jackson, Billy Joel and others, joined the group for a short period during 1992–1993, adding a new voice to the mix.

In 1993, the band released their debut album for MCA Records, &quot;Out of Body.&quot; While not a commercial success in the U.S., the album found a large audience in Europe, especially in Sweden and Germany, where &quot;Boys Will Be Boys&quot;, a song featuring Cyndi Lauper, became a huge hit.

&quot;The Hooters Live&quot;, recorded over two nights in Germany in December 1993, was released in Europe and Asia in 1994, but was never released in the United States. In 1995 the band went on hiatus.

===Reunited (2001–present)===

On November 21, 2001, the Hooters performed a one-off show at the Spectrum in Philadelphia to celebrate disc jockey Pierre Robert&#x27;s 20th anniversary at local rock radio station WMMR, the first major station to play the music of the Hooters in the early 1980s.

In 2003, the Hooters reunited in Germany, where they performed a successful 17-city tour. The success of the tour prompted two further tours in 2004 and 2005, where they premiered new unreleased songs and played in Switzerland and Sweden.

On May 11, 2004, the Hooters were presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Philadelphia Music Awards.

In November 2005, the Hooters appeared on VH1 Classic&#x27;s concert series &quot;Decades Live Rock&quot; as guests of Cyndi Lauper, where they performed &quot;And We Danced&quot; and &quot;All You Zombies.&quot;

In June 2006, the band played their first shows in the United States in over a decade, performing three shows, including a homecoming show at Electric Factory in Philadelphia on June 16, a show at the Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on June 17, and an outdoor show at Hubbard Park in Rob Hyman&#x27;s hometown of Meriden, Connecticut, on June 18.

Following these three shows, the Hooters entered Hyman&#x27;s Elmstreet Studios to record their first album of new material since 1993. In September 2007, &quot;Time Stand Still&quot; was released, preceded by a tour of Europe from June through August, with shows in Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.

In November 2007, the Hooters returned to Europe for a short tour of Switzerland and Germany, including a show filmed for television in Basel, Switzerland, as part the AVO Concerts Series. They played two shows at the Electric Factory in Philadelphia, during Thanksgiving week on Wednesday, November 21 and Friday, November 23, with the November 23 show broadcast by radio station WXPN in 85 markets.

On February 28 and March 1, 2008, the Hooters again entered Elmstreet Studios to begin work on a new album. Accompanied by Ann Marie Calhoun on violin, the band recorded acoustic rearrangements of 12 of their previously released songs, which resulted in a double-disc set, along with the band&#x27;s concerts the previous year at the Electric Factory. The album, &quot;Both Sides Live&quot;, was released in November 2008.

In March 2008, the Hooters played two shows in support of &quot;Time Stand Still&quot;, which was released in the U.S. in February 2008. It included shows at B.B. King&#x27;s Blues Club and Grill in New York City on March 6 and The Birchmere in Alexandria, Virginia, on March 29. In July 2008, the Hooters launched a European summer tour, playing shows in Norway, Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland. On October 23, 2009, in one of their last concerts at the Wachovia Spectrum in Philadelphia, the Hooters, Todd Rundgren, and Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates headlined a concert called Last Call.

In 2017, the Hooters released &quot;Give the Music Back: Live Double Album&quot;, and toured in Europe and played shows in the Philadelphia area.

In May 2023, the Hooters released &quot;Rocking &amp; Swing&quot;, an album supported by a tour of the United States with Rick Springfield, their first full U.S. tour in over a decade.

<text>David Arthur Stephen Tredinnick (born 19 January 1950) is a British Conservative former Member of Parliament who represented Bosworth in Leicestershire from 1987 to 2019.

He is an advocate of alternative medicine, and was chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Integrated Healthcare (previously Integrated and Complementary Healthcare) from 2002 to 2019.

==Early life==
Tredinnick attended Eton College, St John&#x27;s College, Oxford (gaining a MLitt), and the Graduate School of Business at the University of Cape Town, where he gained an MBA.

Tredinnick was commissioned into the Grenadier Guards after passing out from Mons Officer Cadet School on 10 August 1968. He served mainly in Northern Ireland and West Germany. Tredinnick was transferred to the Regular Reserve on 14 March 1971 before resigning his commission on 10 August 1976.

From 1972 to 1973, he was a trainee at EB Savory Milln &amp; Co stockbrokers, then in 1974 he was an account executive at Quadrant Int. In 1976, he was a salesman at Kalle Infotech UK, and sales manager at Word Right Word Processing from 1977 to 1978. From 1978 to 1979, he was a consultant at Baird Communications NV, and marketing manager at QI Europe Ltd from 1979 to 1981. He was manager at Malden Mitcham Properties from 1981 to 1987. As of 2015, he remains a director.

==Parliamentary career==
Tredinnick contested the seat of Cardiff South and Penarth in 1983, coming second (with a 35.9% vote share) to James Callaghan, cutting the former Prime Minister&#x27;s majority from 8,700 to 2,300 votes. He won Bosworth in Leicestershire in 1987. He became a Parliamentary Private Secretary, but was forced to resign in July 1994 after it emerged that he had abused parliamentary privilege by agreeing to accept payment of £1,000 from an undercover reporter to ask questions in Parliament about a non-existent drug. Part of the cash-for-questions affair, the MP was caught in an investigation by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. In April 1995, he was suspended without salary from entering the House of Commons chamber for 20 sitting days.

Tredinnick was the chair of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments from 1997 to 2005, which also made him a member of the Liaison Committee, and he became a member of the Health Select Committee in 2010. In January 2013 he was co-opted into the Science and Technology Select Committee after Caroline Dinenage stepped down and there were no other nominations from the Conservative party.

In February 2019 he announced that he would stand down from parliament at the next election.

Tredinnick supported Boris Johnson in the 2019 Conservative leadership election.

===Support for alternative medicine===
Tredinnick supports alternative medicine including homeopathy and chiropractic. In October 2009, he told Parliament that blood does not clot under a full moon; a spokesperson for the Royal College of Surgeons of England warned that his colleagues would &quot;laugh their heads off&quot; at the suggestion. In the same debate, Tredinnick characterised scientists as &quot;racially prejudiced&quot;.

Health journalist Victoria Lambert has interpreted Health Minister Jeremy Hunt&#x27;s call for traditional Chinese medicine to be available on the NHS as an endorsement of Tredinnick&#x27;s call for integrated alternative healthcare. Tredinnick claims that &quot;herbal medicine is not quackery&quot;, is cost-effective and, unlike mainstream medicine, has been used for thousands of years in China.

In July 2013, Tredinnick sponsored an Early Day Motion congratulating a farmer for his decision to use homeopathy. The motion was supported by one other MP; however, the British veterinary association said there is no evidence of any benefit of the treatment. Tredinnick supported further Early Day Motions on yoga and Ayurveda on International Yoga Day 2017 in favour of &quot;well-being initiatives for NHS staff and for yoga to be integrated within treatment for NHS patients&quot; and another on the Government of India&#x27;s 3rd Ayurveda Day in 2018 &quot;urges the integration of Ayurveda into the NHS ... and calls on the Government to introduce an Ayurveda Chair in all medical schools so that ... medical students gain a thorough grounding in this ancient science of healthcare.&quot; Neither of these motions succeeded.

Although Sally Davies, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO), had described homeopathy as &quot;rubbish&quot;, it was reported in May 2014 that health secretary Jeremy Hunt, at Tredinnick&#x27;s urging, had requested a review of three studies by the French company, Boiron. These were found not to demonstrate the effectiveness of homeopathy, and the quality of the research in them was later questioned by Edzard Ernst. Tredinnick told &quot;The Independent&quot; in June 2015 that homeopathy&#x27;s common rejection was the result of &quot;vested interests trying to protect their own turf&quot;.

In October 2019 Tredinnick again advocated alternative medicine in the House of Commons. He recommended that Ayurveda, yoga, naturopathy, homeopathy, osteopathy and chiropractic be considered in &quot;a new health paradigm&quot; for the NHS. Tredinnick made reference to the Indian Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga &amp; Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa and Homoeopathy established by Hindu nationalist Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi in 2014, India&#x27;s &quot;sustainable health ministry&quot; and its &quot;4,000-year-old medical system plus the world’s greatest usage of homeopathy&quot;, and China&#x27;s &quot;traditional 4,000-year-old herbal medicine system and acupuncture&quot;, claiming that &quot;one third of the world’s population already has sustainable healthcare&quot;. He had previously raised AYSUH in a question to Boris Johnson in July 2019 and in a written question to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care in June 2018, to which the latter, Steve Brine replied his department had &quot;no plans&quot; to &quot;hold discussions with the Ministry of AYUSH&quot;.

====Astrology in medicine====
Tredinnick is a supporter of astrology and its use in medical practice.

In November 2009, he spoke at a meeting organised by the Astrological Association of Great Britain, where he related his personal experience of astrology and illness, advocating that astrology be integrated into the National Health Service (NHS). In 2014 he told MPs: &quot;I am absolutely convinced that those who look at the map of the sky for the day that they were born and receive some professional guidance will find out a lot about themselves and it will make their lives easier&quot;. &quot;I do believe that astrology and complementary medicine would help take the huge pressure off doctors&quot;, he told &quot;Astrological Journal&quot; in February 2015. &quot;People such as Professor Brian Cox, who called astrology &#x27;rubbish&#x27; have simply not studied the subject. The BBC is quite dismissive of astrology and seeks to promote the science perspective and seems always keen to broadcast criticisms of astrology&quot;. Liberal Democrat Michael Mullaney, who stood against him at the 2015 general election, was concerned about his &quot;utterly ridiculous obsession with astrology&quot; asking: &quot;Will Mr Tredinnick ever stop?&quot;

====Criticism====
Tredinnick&#x27;s views have attracted criticism. During the 2010 United Kingdom general election, he was opposed by &quot;New Scientist&quot; journalist Michael Brooks who objected to &quot;Tredinnick&#x27;s outspoken promotion of alternative medicine.&quot; During a hustings debate called by Brooks to &quot;highlight the scientific literacy of the UK&#x27;s elected representatives&quot;, Brooks said that Tredinnick regarded homeopathy as a suitable treatment for malaria and HIV, which Tredinnick did not deny. In March 2013, Tredinnick&#x27;s opinions were described as &quot;nonsensical&quot; by the government&#x27;s outgoing chief scientist, Sir John Beddington, who said the MP had fallen for the &quot;Galileo fallacy&quot; (&quot;Galileo was laughed at but was right; therefore since I am laughed at I must be right&quot;).

Tredinnick&#x27;s appointment to the Health Committee in June 2010 was criticised in two science reports in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Martin Robbins said the appointment was &quot;an extremely disturbing development&quot;, even though &quot;Tredinnick is a figure unlikely to be taken seriously by policymakers&quot;. &quot;Nature&quot;″s Adam Rutherford described Tredinnick as &quot;misinformed about a great many things&quot; and said that &quot;giving [him] influence on medical policy...is a bad move.&quot; &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;″s writer Ian Douglas described the appointment as &quot;a problem&quot;.

Tredinnick&#x27;s appointment to the Science and Technology Committee also drew criticism. Andy McSmith in &quot;The Independent&quot; cited Tredinnick&#x27;s view that homeopathy could cure HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, urinary infections, diarrhoea, skin eruptions, diabetes, epilepsy, eye infections, intestinal parasites, cancer, and gangrene among other conditions, and quoted Imran Khan, former head of the Campaign for Science and Engineering, as saying that &quot;someone with such incredibly odd views is not helpful.&quot; Tom Whipple in &quot;The Times&quot; said his appointment caused despair, whilst Elizabeth Gibney in the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; quoted the Skeptical Voter website as saying that Tredinnick is &quot;perhaps the worst example of scientific illiteracy in government.&quot; Lord Winston described his beliefs in homeopathy and astrology as &quot;lunatic&quot;.

===Freedom of Information and expenses===
In May 2007, Tredinnick was among 98 MPs who voted to exempt themselves from the Freedom of Information Act, ending the compulsory legal requirement for MPs to disclose their expenses. The move was later overturned by the House of Lords.

In 2006, Tredinnick claimed for astrology software and tuition, saying it was for a debate on alternative medicine, and had been cleared with the Commons fees office. In 2009, he claimed £125 for a course on &quot;intimate relationships&quot; on his Parliamentary office costs allowance, but this was rejected. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; also noted he was claiming up to £7000 a quarter for a mortgage on a £2m house near Parliament. In early 2010, during the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal, it emerged that Tredinnick had chosen to return £755.33 as he had decided that his expenditure on astrology software was supplementary to his parliamentary duties, although the parliamentary commissioner for standards John Lyon had decided against requesting that he should do so.

===Brexit===
Tredinnick was opposed to Brexit prior to the 2016 referendum.

==Personal life==
Tredinnick was married to Rebecca Jane Shott from 1983 until 2008 with whom he has a daughter and a son.
He lives in Sussex.

There has been a habitation in Oadby since an Anglian settlement in the early Anglo-Saxon period. Though the name Oadby is Danish (meaning &quot;Outi&#x27;s dwelling&quot;) it must have existed long before the Danish invasions as is shown by the existence of a pagan Anglian cemetery. The original Anglian name has been lost. In 1760, on Brocks Hill, evidence of an Anglian burial ground was discovered. The Middle Angles came under the rule of the kings of Mercia and were later conquered by the Danish invaders. Oadby is one of seventy Danish settlements in Leicestershire ending with &quot;-by&quot;, which means village or settlement. Its name probably came from Old Norse &quot;Auðarbýr&quot; = &quot;Auði&#x27;s settlement&quot;. Danish rule continued until 920, when King Alfred the Great won his battles against the Danes: the Oadby area is supposed to be the site of at least one of these battles.

In the Domesday Book, 1086, Oadby&#x27;s name was recorded as Oldebi. Other early forms are Oladebi, Outheby (Feet of Fines, 1199), Onderby and, finally, Oadby. When King Harold had been defeated, William the Conqueror gave Oadby to Hugh de Grandmesnil, Governor of Leicestershire, who founded the parish church of Oadby on the site of the present St Peter&#x27;s Church. The tenants of the manor of Oadby were Roger who held one and half carucates, and Countess Judith who held 9 carucates and 2 bovates, and 30 acres of meadow. On the Countess&#x27;s land were 46 socmen, eleven bordars and three serfs; two carucates were let to Robert de Buci. The manor was held in 1444 by William Ferrers; in 1457 it was held by William Grey, Lord Ferrers of Groby. In 1541 the manor was held by John Waldron; his successor John Waldron sold it in 1629 to Sir John Lombe. In 1831 the main landed proprietors were the trustees of the late George Wyndham (patrons of the vicarage), George Legh Keck (lord of the manor) and Thomas Pares.

=== Late 19th Century ===
Oadby remained a small settlement until the late 19th century when it became a fashionable suburb for the businessmen of Leicester, such as the factory owners of Leicester&#x27;s shoe and stocking manufacturers. Many substantial houses were built in Oadby, some of which are now used by the University of Leicester.

Stoughton Road in Oadby contains two sets of houses of historical interest. Some of the Framework Knitters Homes date back to 1909, while the North Memorial Homes, financed by Sir Jonathan North (former Mayor of Leicester), were built in 1927 and opened in the same year by the Prince of Wales. As well as a series of houses, the North Memorial Homes site also houses the North Memorial Hall, built in a neo-Georgian style, which has been leased to Oadby Evangelical Free Church since 1974.

In the late 19th century Oadby town centre was focused along Leicester Road, The Parade and London Road. The oldest properties and locations can be found at the Wigston Road, London Road junction through to the Glen Road (A6) junction. Some of the 19th century buildings that remain are the cottages and shops (including Wilson B Ragg Butchers &amp; Gingerbread Cottage bakers) along London Road through to Glen Road.

===Modern Times===
Expansion of Oadby took place rapidly in the 20th century and was still continuing in 2017. Many residential developments have been constructed, and the population in 2011 reached 23,849.

In the early 20th century, the Travellers Rest (located near to the London Road Glen Road junction) was torn down in 1939 and replaced by The Oadby Owl on a neighbouring site. Both inns were run by Walter Cufflin (a descendant of James Hawker).

==Oadby today==

Oadby is a large district centre with a good range of shops,

<text>Leicester Forest East (LFE) is a large suburban village in Leicestershire, England, west of Leicester, straddling the M1 motorway. It is part of the Blaby district.

Leicester Forest East is a popular location among commuters and young families. It was developed primarily between 1920 and 1985, seeing major developments constructed along the Hinckley Road (A47) and to the south-east of the M1 throughout the 1930s. Large-scale housing developments took place in the 1960s, to the north-east and west of the M1 motorway. In the 1980s, a large housing project was constructed at the western edge of the settlement. The village takes its name from the ancient Leicester Forest. The streets through the housing developments to the north-east of the M1 take their names from Ann Packer and Robbie Brightwell, Olympic medalists in the 1964 Tokyo games.

==Amenities==
There are local shopping facilities at the eastern end of the community, including a newsagent, a post office and a Co-op supermarket with a cash-dispenser. There are also numerous local shops along the Hinckley Road approaching the western end of the community, including a small Nisa (formerly Sainsbury’s), a chip shop, a vape shop, three hair salons and a Tesco Express Store, which is on the site of the old petrol garage at the Kirby Lane junction. The new community run Public Library is next to the Stafford Leys Primary School with the old library now being a dog-grooming saloon. There are two medical centres in Leicester Forest East, one at the eastern end housing a general practitioners, a pharmacy and a dentist, and another on the western end (Warren Lane) with similar facilities run by the same practice. There is a veterinary surgery along the Hinckley Road, next to Elliot Drive.
There are two pubs with hotels in Leicester Forest East, both on the A47. The Forest Park Inn is a recently refurbished family motel with outdoor patio seating. The other is a much older establishment called The Red Cow (which strictly speaking is in Kirby Muxloe). Both serve food and offer accommodation.

The Parish Hall is situated on King&#x27;s Drive, by the playing field/park. A new playpark was installed in early 2009. Recently the Parish Hall have played hosts to Clubszone, a local children&#x27;s activity provider running in the school holidays. They also host a community cinema which is on the first Thursday evening at 7.30 of every month (except July/August).

There are three places of Christian worship – St Andrews, an ecumenical church with Anglican and Methodist congregations. Also behind the church there is a local Beavers, Cubs, Scouts Troop (92nd Leicester Forest East). There is a meeting house for Jehovahs witnesses in Hinckley Road. There is also the nearby Forest Chapel, where a playgroup and day care centre (Forest Chapel Day Care) operate.

==Transport==
*There are bus services to Leicester, Hinckley, Nuneaton and other local destinations. Bus services are operated by Stagecoach Midlands and Arriva Midlands East. There is also a park and ride service from Meynells Gorse on the eastern edge of Leicester Forest East to the city centre. An additional service (route 51) runs from Braunstone Cross Roads into the city centre, provided by Arriva.
*Leicester Forest East does not have a railway station but provision has been made for one at Meynell&#x27;s Gorse. The Leicester and Swannington Railway that runs through the area is now freight-only but it carried passengers until 1964 and could do so again if Phase two of the proposed Ivanhoe Line were to go ahead. This would connect Leicester Forest East to Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Coalville, Burton upon Trent and Leicester railway station.
*Road links are excellent, but heavily congested, with the A47 bisecting the community – running to Hinckley, Birmingham and Leicester. There is good access to the A46 road where it bypasses Leicester, and from there to the M1 and M69. Congestion on the A47 particularly in the mornings, for city bound traffic, is a major issue for commuters in Leicester Forest East, and for those using this road. Equally, there is congestion on Ratby Lane in the late afternoons for traffic leaving the A46 and M1 wishing to join the A47 from this direction.
*Facilities for cyclists are made with on-road cycle lanes having been put in along the greater part of Hinckley Road during 2009. The main routes to and from the city, and to major shopping areas are indirect and on busy roads. There are no secure cycle parking facilities at the local shops, the community centre or the churches.
*There is a reasonably well-maintained network of local footpaths giving pleasant walks towards Enderby, Thorpe Astley and Kirby Muxloe.

==Schools==
Stafford Leys Primary School opened in 1966 under the headship of Gordon Hill (who was better known as a football league referee). The school takes pupils from reception up to year 6. The current headteacher is Mr A.Kitchen. In 2003, the Leicester Tigers star Freddie Tuilagi opened a new library building, one of the largest primary school libraries in the county. In 2006, the school achieved the National Healthy Schools Standard, for its work in educating pupils about healthy eating, exercise, emotional issues and bullying. The school has also attained the Basic Skills and Investors in People awards. In its May 2006 inspection, Ofsted assessed the school as &quot;Satisfactory&quot;, point 3 on a four-point scale, saying &quot;This is a satisfactory school, which has improved well since the last inspection, when it was judged to have serious weaknesses.&quot;. The Ofsted inspection in June 2009 assessed the school as &#x27;Good&#x27; and identified a number of aspects which were outstanding.

Secondary education will typically continue at South Charnwood High School in Markfield.

Holmfield Primary School, on the eastern boundary of Leicester Forest East, was closed permanently by Leicestershire County Council on 16 July 2010.

A new £4m school was built on the former site of Holmfield Primary School. Fossebrook Primary School opened for its first intake in September 2016, it provides primary years education to pupils living in Leicester Forest East and Braunstone Town. The school opened with 210 places, with the potential to expand as demand increases. The Discovery Schools Academy Trust has been selected to sponsor the school. The school has extensive parking for staff, parents, visitors and local residents.

==Motorway service area==

Most people know Leicester Forest East for the Leicester Forest East motorway service station on the M1 motorway, which opened on 14 February 1966 just over a year after the motorway reached Markfield. It was based on an Italian design used on the &quot;autostrade&quot; which is very unusual in Britain. At the time of opening it was operated by the Ross Group and featured a Terence Conran designed restaurant with a waitress silver service restaurant. There is no legal access for public vehicles to the motorway from within Leicester Forest East (although some members of the public use the slip-road which is properly reserved for service station employees and emergency vehicles as a means of getting on and off the M1).

There are long term plans to widen the M1 motorway, which if given the go-ahead would have transformed the stretch of the M1 that bisects Leicester Forest East from the current eight lanes to ten lanes. Many local residents have campaigned against such schemes. Any developments would result in the closure of Leicester Forest East service station.

<text>De Montfort Hall is the largest music and performance venue in Leicester, England. It is situated adjacent to Victoria Park and is named after the &quot;Father of Parliament&quot;, Simon de Montfort, the 6th Earl of Leicester.

==History==
The hall was built by the Corporation of Leicester in 1912 and 1913, and was opened to the public on 21 July 1913, at a cost of £21,000. The architect was Shirley Harrison (1876–1961), who also designed the Usher Hall in Edinburgh. He was the son of Stockdale Harrison, architect of Vaughan College.

Its indoor auditorium seating capacity is approximately 2000, and the hall contains a pipe organ believed to be the only surviving example of a large concert organ by Leicester organ builders Stephen Taylor &amp; Son Ltd. The organ was installed in 1914. The pipe organ is a particularly fine example and comprises 6000 pipes, attracting many distinguished organists to play recitals. In 2014 the pipe organ was estimated to be worth over five million GBP.

The hall features in Richard Attenborough&#x27;s film &quot;Grey Owl&quot; (1999), in a reenactment of Attenborough and his brother David&#x27;s boyhood attendance at a wildlife lecture.

==Notable events==
Most of the hall&#x27;s events take place in the indoor auditorium, with shows spanning popular music, comedy, opera, ballet, world and roots music, West End musicals, classical music and a popular and traditional annual pantomime which runs from December to January. The Leicester Symphony Orchestra, started by Sir Malcolm Sargent, was established at the hall in 1922 and perform four concerts each season. The Leicester Philharmonic Choir and the Bardi Symphony Orchestra are also regular performers. With the world-famous Philharmonia Orchestra enjoying a residency at the hall since 1997.

De Montfort Hall is also the largest venue in Leicester to hold the Hindu festival of Navratri.

Events take place at the hall&#x27;s spacious and scenic gardens. In recent years these have included The Big Session Festival and the Summer Sundae music festival, both ceased in 2012.

Graduation ceremonies for the University of Leicester have been taking place in the hall since 1958.

Buddy Holly and The Crickets performed at the venue in March 1958.

The Beatles played three concerts here between 1963 and 1964, at the height of Beatlemania.

Bob Dylan played at the hall on 2 May 1965 during his first tour of England.

Progressive rock group Genesis recorded the majority of their 1973 release &quot;Genesis Live&quot; at the Hall.

Family, originally from Leicester, performed their farewell concert at the Hall on October 13, 1973.

Iron Maiden performed here in 1980, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1986 and 1990.

Neo-progressive rock group Marillion recorded part of their first live album &quot;Real to Reel&quot; at De Montfort Hall, along with other live performances recorded or otherwise.

In 2011, a tribute for Sir Norman Wisdom was held at the venue, raising money for the Roy Castle Fund. The charitable event also raised funds for Grand Order of Water Rats, of which Wisdom was a member, and featured notable appearances from members Bruce Jones, Nicholas Parsons, Johnny Mans, Rick Wakeman and Jess Conrad.

Westlife lead vocalist Shane Filan played at the hall twice as a solo artist in 2014 and 2018.

Keane performed there on 25 September 2019.

<text>The Abbey Pumping Station is a museum of science and technology in Leicester, England, on Corporation Road, next to the National Space Centre. With four working steam-powered beam engines from its time as a sewage pumping station, it also houses exhibits for transport, public health, light and optics, toys and civil engineering.

==Sewage pumping station==
The building was constructed in 1891 by Leicester Corporation on the north side of Leicester, alongside the River Soar, as a pumping station used to pump the town&#x27;s sewage to the sewage farm at Beaumont Leys. The grand Victorian building, designed by Stockdale Harrison (Leicester architect) in 1890, houses four Woolf compound beam engines built by Gimson and Company of Leicester. The first attempt to respond to the population&#x27;s sewage disposal was in 1850 when piped water made water closets possible, and Thomas Wicksteed designed and built sewers leading to a sedimentation and deodorisation treatment works on the northern, downstream, edge of the town. Limited capacity and high costs meant that a Pail closet system continued to be used for poorer neighbourhoods. As the town expanded so did the problems of pollution in the River Soar from the treatment works. Disposal of the night soil from the pail closets, via railway wagons and canal barges, caused complaints of smell and pollution. A new solution was needed and the answer was to pump everything to a sewage farm on higher ground at Beaumont Leys. The Abbey Pumping Station replaced a smaller facility at Knighton. The pumping station was fed by two main trunk sewers, one from the East of the city that ran under Bruin Street and then under the Grand Union Canal, and another that ran along the route of Abbey Lane and then across fields. By 1912, the 2,000-acre sewage farm and pumping capacity of up to 20 million gallons a day was insufficient to meet the needs of the growing city, with 130 miles of new sewers built since the station opened, and extensions were agreed. In 1939 a ram pump was installed, reportedly the largest of its kind in Europe at the time. The station continued pumping Leicester&#x27;s sewage until 1964, when electric pumps took over, and within a few years the Wanlip Sewage Treatment plant took over and the pumping station was no longer needed.

==Museum==
In 1972 the building re-opened as a museum of science and technology, run by Leicestershire Museums. The huge beam engines were retained intact, and were gradually restored to full working order. It is one of several historic pumping stations which have been preserved. Leicester City Council became a unitary authority in 1997 and the Abbey Pumping Station is one of the museums that is within their jurisdiction.

==Displays==
The steam engines (see below) which drive the sewage pumps can be seen. In addition, there is combination of informative educational displays (mainly about water and sewage), an old-fashioned film theatre, and collections of artifacts and pictures ranging from domestic appliances to trams. An eclectic collection of larger items of industrial archeology is in the grounds. This includes a narrow-gauge railway and some transport items.

==Beam engines==

The four steam engines were built in Leicester by Gimson and Company and today are rare examples of Woolf compound rotative beam engines. At the time these engines were built they were considered an old-fashioned but very well-established design. The engines are large examples. The cylinders are x and x . The cast-iron flywheels are diameter and the beams are of plain steel plate construction and long. The engines are of 200 indicated horsepower each.

These engines are rated at 200 hp, at 12–19 rpm, of which they pumped 208,000 imperial gallons of sewage an hour (263 L/s).

All four engines have been restored to working condition by a team of volunteers: the Leicester Museums Technology Association. It is the only engine house in the world where you can see four working examples of the same beam engine in one building.

Current projects in the engine house are the ongoing maintenance of the latest restored engine, No.1 (restored over a period of 4 years by the volunteers).

==Museum collections==
The Pumping Station is normally open Daily from 11am - 4:30pm. Engines can be seen in steam at various steam days along with other steam and early internal combustion exhibits.

==Transport collection==
The Museum has a narrow-gauge railway which is normally operated by &quot;Leonard&quot;, an narrow-gauge locomotive built by W.G. Bagnall, Stafford as works number 2087 in 1918, but four diesel locomotives – two Simplex, one Lister and one Ruston – are also available if needed.

There is also a collection of vintage road vehicles which are operated on selected days. Exhibits include several fire engines, buses (see below), an 1894 Aveling and Porter steam roller, several diesel rollers, a Bedford fish and chips van, an ex Leicester Corporation Tramways tower wagon and an Austin K2 brewery dray lorry with ales.

<doc id="420332" wikidata="Q1161485" url="?curid=420332" title="Daniel Lambert">
<text>Daniel Lambert ( 1770 – 1809) was an English gaol keeper and animal breeder from Leicester, famous for his unusually large size. After serving four years as an apprentice at an engraving and die casting works in Birmingham, he returned to Leicester around 1788 and succeeded his father as keeper of Leicester&#x27;s gaol. He was a keen sportsman and extremely strong; on one occasion he fought a bear in the streets of Leicester. He was an expert in sporting animals, widely respected for his expertise with dogs, horses and fighting cocks.

At the time of Lambert&#x27;s return to Leicester, his weight began to increase steadily, even though he was athletically active and, by his own account, abstained from drinking alcohol and did not eat unusual amounts of food. In 1805, Lambert&#x27;s gaol closed. By this time, he weighed , and had become the heaviest authenticated person up to that point in recorded history. Unemployable and sensitive about his size, Lambert became a recluse.

In 1806, poverty forced Lambert to put himself on exhibition to raise money. In , he took up residence in London, charging spectators to enter his apartments to meet him. Visitors were impressed by his intelligence and personality, and visiting him became highly fashionable. After some months on public display, Lambert grew tired of exhibiting himself, and in , he returned, wealthy, to Leicester, where he bred sporting dogs and regularly attended sporting events. Between 1806 and 1809, he made a further series of short fundraising tours.

In June 1809, he died suddenly in Stamford, Lincolnshire. At the time of his death, he weighed , and his coffin required of wood. Despite the coffin being built with wheels to allow easy transport, and a sloping approach being dug to the grave, it took 20 men almost half an hour to drag his casket into the trench, in a newly opened burial ground to the rear of St Martin&#x27;s Church. While others have since overtaken Daniel Lambert&#x27;s record as the heaviest person in history, he remains a popular character in Leicester, and in 2009 was described by the &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot; as &quot;one of the city&#x27;s most cherished icons&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Daniel Lambert was born at his parents&#x27; house in Blue Boar Lane, Leicester, on 13 March 1770. His father, also named Daniel Lambert, had been the huntsman to Harry Grey, 4th Earl of Stamford, and at the time of his son&#x27;s birth was the keeper of Leicester&#x27;s gaol. The eldest of four children, Daniel Lambert had two sisters, and a brother who died young.

At the age of eight he was a keen swimmer, and for much of his life he taught local children to swim. Lambert&#x27;s paternal uncle—like his father—also worked with animals, but as a professional gamekeeper; his maternal grandfather was a breeder of champion fighting cocks. Lambert grew up with a strong interest in field sports, and was particularly fond of otter hunting, fishing, shooting and horse racing. From his early teens, Lambert was a keen sportsman and by his late teens he was considered an expert in the breeding of hunting dogs.

In 1784, he was apprenticed to Messrs Taylor &amp; Co, an engraving and die casting works in Birmingham owned by a Mr Benjamin Patrick. The engraved buckles and buttons in which Patrick&#x27;s factory specialised became unfashionable, however, and the business went into decline. In 1788, Lambert returned to Leicester, to serve as his father&#x27;s assistant at the gaol (some sources date Lambert&#x27;s return to Leicester to 1791, following the destruction of the building housing Messrs Taylor &amp; Co in the Priestley Riots of ). His father retired soon afterwards and Lambert succeeded him as gaol keeper. The younger Daniel Lambert was a much-respected gaoler; he befriended many of the prisoners, and made every effort to help them when they went to trial.

===Weight===

Although by his own account Lambert did not eat unusually large amounts of food, at about the time of his return to Leicester his weight began to increase steadily, and by 1793, he weighed . Concerned for his fitness, in his spare time he devoted himself to exercise, building his strength to the point where he was able to easily carry . On one occasion, while he was watching a dancing bear on display in Blue Boar Lane, his dog slipped loose and bit it. The bear knocked the dog to the ground, and Lambert asked its keeper to restrain it so he could retrieve his wounded animal, but the keeper removed the bear&#x27;s muzzle so it could attack the dog. Lambert reportedly struck the bear with a pole and with his left hand, punched its head, knocking it to the ground to allow the dog to escape.

Despite his increasingly large girth, Lambert remained fit and active, once walking from Woolwich to the City of London &quot;with much less apparent fatigue than several middle-sized men who were of the party&quot;. Although not particularly agile, he was not significantly restricted by the size of his body, and was able to stand on one leg and kick the other to a height of . He continued to teach swimming in Leicester, and was able to stay afloat with two grown men sitting on his back. He disliked changing his clothes, and each morning habitually wore the clothes he had worn the day before, regardless of whether they were still wet; by Lambert&#x27;s own account he suffered no colds or other ill effects from this behaviour.

By 1801, Lambert&#x27;s weight had increased to about , and, as his bulk meant neither he nor his horse were able to keep up with the hunt, he was forced to give up hunting. He continued to maintain an interest in field sports, keeping a pack of 30 terriers. By this time, although he retained his solid reputation as a gaoler, serious concerns were being raised about his fitness for the post. Traditional gaols were falling out of favour and being replaced with forced labour institutions, and in 1805, the old Bridewell gaol was closed. Lambert was left without a job, but was granted an annuity of £50 (about £ as of ) a year by the Leicester magistrates, in recognition of his excellent service as gaol keeper.

===Unemployment===
Lambert&#x27;s girth was then enormous; six men of normal size could fit together inside his waistcoat, and each of his stockings was the size of a sack. His £50 annuity did not adequately cover his living costs, and his size prevented him from working. He became a virtual recluse. Stories of his bulk had by then begun to spread, and travellers visiting Leicester would use various pretexts to visit his home. One such visitor asked Lambert&#x27;s servant to allow him entry as he wished to ask Lambert&#x27;s advice about fighting cocks; Lambert leaned out of the window and told the servant to &quot;tell the gentleman that I am a shy cock&quot;. On another occasion, he admitted into his house a Nottingham man who sought his advice about a mare&#x27;s pedigree; on realising the man was visiting only to look at him, Lambert told him that the horse in question was &quot;by Impertinence out of Curiosity&quot;.

Sensitive about his weight, Daniel Lambert refused to allow himself to be weighed, but sometime around 1805, some friends persuaded him to come with them to a cock fight in Loughborough. Once he had squeezed his way into their carriage, the rest of the party drove the carriage onto a large scale and jumped out. After deducting the weight of the (previously weighed) empty carriage, they calculated that Lambert&#x27;s weight was now , and that he had thus overtaken Edward Bright, the &quot;Fat Man of Maldon&quot;, as the heaviest authenticated person in recorded history.

===London===

Despite his shyness, Lambert badly needed to earn money, and saw no alternative to putting himself on display, and charging his spectators. On 4 April 1806, he boarded a specially built carriage and travelled from Leicester to his new home at 53 Piccadilly, then near the western edge of London. For five hours each day, he welcomed visitors into his home, charging each a shilling (about £ as of ).

Lambert shared his interests and knowledge of sports, dogs and animal husbandry with London&#x27;s middle and upper classes, and it soon became highly fashionable to visit him, or become his friend. Many called repeatedly; one banker made 20 visits, paying the admission fee on each occasion. During this period of English history no real stigma was attached to obesity, and Lambert was generally considered a wonder to be marvelled at, rather than a freak to be gawped or sneered at. His business venture was immediately successful, drawing around 400 paying visitors per day. His home was described as having the air of a fashionable resort, rather than that of an exhibition, and he was pleased to find that his customers generally treated him with courtesy, and not simply as a spectacle. He insisted on maintaining amongst his visitors an atmosphere of civility and all men entering his rooms were obliged to remove their hats. One visitor refused to remove his &quot;even if the King were present&quot; but Lambert replied that &quot;Then by G——, Sir, you must instantly quit this room, as I do not consider it a mark of respect due to myself, but to the ladies and gentlemen who honor me with their company.&quot;

Lambert&#x27;s popularity inspired an imitator in &quot;Master Wybrants, Mr. Lambert in miniature&quot;, exhibited a short distance away in Sackville Street. A handbill described Wybrants as &quot;Master Wybrants the Modern Hercules, who at the age of 4 Months weighed 39 pounds, measured 2 feet round the Body 15 Inches round the thigh and 8 Inches round the Arm, to be seen at the corner of Sackville Street Piccadilly&quot;.

People would travel long distances to see him (on one occasion, a party of 14 travelled to London from Guernsey), and many would spend hours speaking with him on animal breeding. A life-sized waxwork of Lambert was displayed in London, where it became extremely popular. Daniel Lambert soon became a popular subject with cartoonists, who often depicted him as John Bull. He mixed well with the upper classes, and on one occasion met King George III. The King&#x27;s and Lambert&#x27;s reactions to this meeting are not recorded.

===Medical examination===

Lambert soon came to the attention of the medical profession, and shortly after his arrival in London, the &quot;Medical and Physical Journal&quot; published an article about him. They confirmed that he weighed , and measured his height as . A thorough medical examination found that his bodily functions worked correctly, and that he breathed freely. Lambert was described as active and mentally alert, well-read, and with an excellent memory. He was fond of singing, and had a normal speaking voice which showed no signs of pressure on the lungs. Doctors found tumefaction of his feet, legs and thighs, and accumulation of fat within the abdomen, but other than scaly and thickened skin on his legs caused by previous attacks of erysipelas, he had no health problems. Lambert told the doctors that he ate normal quantities of ordinary food. He claimed that since about 1795 he had drunk nothing but water, and that even while young, and a regular party-goer, he did not join his fellow revellers in drinking. Lambert claimed that he was able to walk about a quarter of a mile (400 m) without difficulty. He slept regularly for no more than eight hours per night, always with his window open, and was never heard to snore; on waking he was always fully alert within five minutes, and he never napped during the day.

====Possible causes====
It is impossible to be certain about what caused Daniel Lambert&#x27;s extreme weight, but it is considered unlikely to have been caused by an endocrine (glandular) or genetic disorder. Other than his weight gain, he showed no symptoms of a thyroid disorder, and none of his many portraits show the moon face of a patient with Cushing&#x27;s syndrome. Patients with Bardet–Biedl syndrome and Prader–Willi syndrome, genetic syndromes which can lead to obesity in patients, also have learning disabilities and muscular weakness, but all those who knew Lambert agreed that he was highly intelligent, was extremely strong physically, and, except for erysipelas and venous insufficiency (varicose veins) in his legs, did not have any health problems. One contemporary commentator remarked that &quot;Mr. Lambert scarcely knows what it is to be ailing or indisposed&quot;. Lambert&#x27;s only recorded psychological problem was an occasional &quot;depression of the spirits&quot;, during his time in London. Although he had an aunt and uncle who were overweight, his parents and surviving siblings remained of normal build throughout their lives.

Consequently, it is likely that Lambert&#x27;s weight gain was caused not by a physical disorder but by a combination of overeating and a lack of exercise. Although heavily built in his teens, he began to gain weight only when he took up the relatively sedentary job of prison keeper. A biography of Lambert published during his lifetime recounted that &quot;it was within a year of this appointment that his bulk received the greatest and most rapid encrease&quot;. Although he claimed to eat little, and to abstain from alcohol, it is likely that a man with his lifestyle and position in society would have eaten large amounts of meat, and drunk beer at social events.

===Józef Boruwłaski===
After some months in London, Lambert was visited by Józef Boruwłaski, a dwarf then in his seventies. Born in 1739 to a poor family in rural Pokuttya, Boruwłaski was generally considered to be the last of Europe&#x27;s court dwarfs. He was introduced to the Empress Maria Theresa in 1754, and after a short time residing with deposed Polish king Stanisław Leszczyński, he exhibited himself around Europe, thus becoming a wealthy man. At age 60, he retired to Durham, where he became such a popular figure that the City of Durham paid him to live there and he became one of its most prominent citizens. Boruwłaski had a superb memory, and recalled that Lambert, while still employed by Patrick&#x27;s die casting works and before he grew fat, had paid to see him in Birmingham. Boruwłaski remarked &quot;I have seen this face twenty years before at Birmingham, but certainly it be another body&quot;. He had been told that Lambert&#x27;s bulk was a hoax, and he therefore felt his leg to prove to himself that it was not. The two men compared their respective outfits, and calculated that one of Lambert&#x27;s sleeves would provide enough cloth to make an entire coat for Boruwłaski. Lambert enquired after Boruwłaski&#x27;s wife, Isalina Barbutan, whereupon the latter replied &quot;No, she is dead, and I am not very sorry, for when I affront her, she put me on the mantle-shelf for punishment.&quot;

The meeting of Lambert and Boruwłaski, the largest and smallest men in the country, was the subject of enormous public interest; one newspaper reported that &quot;It was &quot;Sir John Falstaff&quot; and &quot;Tom Thumb&quot;, which must have afforded a &quot;double&quot; treat to the curious&quot;. Boruwłaski lived to see his 98th year, despite the prediction of the money-lender who sold him his annuity that his small stature would make him prone to illness.

===Disillusionment===

Although generally respected by London society, the longer Lambert remained there, the more irritable he became. Shy and self-conscious, he was annoyed at repeatedly being asked about the size of his clothes. In answer to one request, to a woman who enquired as to the cost of his coat, he replied &quot;I cannot pretend to charge my memory with the price, but I can put you into a method of obtaining the information you want. If you think proper to make me a present of a new coat, you will then know exactly what it costs&quot;. Another interested spectator claimed that since his entrance fee was paying for Lambert&#x27;s clothing, he had the right to know about it; Lambert replied &quot;Sir, if I knew what part of my next coat your shilling would pay for, I can assure you I would cut out the piece&quot;. Lambert calculated in 1806 that a full suit of clothes cost him £20, about £ as of .

===Return to Leicester===
Lambert had the acumen to refuse the management offers of various impresarios and agents, and by , he had returned to Leicester as a wealthy man. He returned to his favourite pastimes, breeding sporting dogs and fighting cocks. A terrier bitch, for which he was offered 100 guineas (about £ as of ), was said to be the finest in England. He refused to sell the dog, which became his lifetime companion. He began again to attend sporting events, as a report on the Leicester Races of September 1806 noted that &quot;Among the distinguished characters upon the turf we were glad to see our old friend, Mr. Daniel Lambert, in apparent high health and spirits&quot;. Although too heavy to follow hunts on horseback, he used a portion of the money earned in London to build up a pack of greyhounds, watching from his carriage as they coursed hares in the Leicestershire countryside.

In December 1806, Lambert went on a brief fundraising tour, and exhibited himself in Birmingham and Coventry. Early the next year he returned to London, and stayed in the fashionable Leicester Square. There he fell ill; his physician Dr Heaviside felt that his illness might have been caused by the polluted London air, and Lambert returned to Leicester. He recovered, and later in 1807, made a series of tours of England.
In summer 1808, Lambert briefly returned to the capital, where he sold a pair of spaniels for 75 guineas (about £ as of ) at Tattersalls. Later that year, he exhibited himself in York. In , he set off on another tour of East Anglia, to conclude in Stamford during the Stamford Races. One account suggests that this tour was intended to be his last, as he was then sufficiently wealthy to retire. While on the tour, Lambert was weighed in Ipswich; his weight was . No longer able to use stairs, he took lodgings on the ground floor of the Waggon &amp; Horses inn at 47 High Street, Stamford on 20 June.

===Death===
Following his arrival at Stamford, Lambert sent a message to the &quot;Stamford Mercury&quot;, ordering advertisements and handbills. Stating that , he asked the printer to visit him at the Waggon &amp; Horses, to discuss his printing requirements. That evening, Lambert was in bed and admitted to feeling tired, but nonetheless he was able to discuss his requirements with the printer, and was anxious that the handbills be delivered on time.

On the morning of 21 June, Lambert woke at his usual time and appeared in good health. As he began to shave, he complained of breathing difficulties. Ten minutes later, he collapsed and died.

There was no autopsy, and the cause of Lambert&#x27;s death is unknown. While many sources say that he died of a fatty degeneration of the heart or of stress on his heart caused by his size and weight, his behaviour in the period leading to his death does not match that of someone with cardiac insufficiency; witnesses agree that on the morning of his death he appeared well, before he became short of breath and collapsed. Bondeson (2006) speculates that the most consistent explanation of his death, given his symptoms and medical history, is that he had a sudden pulmonary embolism.

==Burial==
Lambert&#x27;s corpse rapidly began to putrefy. There was no question of his body being returned to Leicester, and so on 22 June, it was placed inside an elm coffin, 6 feet 4 inches long, 4 feet 4 inches wide and 2 feet 4 inches deep (193 cm × 132 cm × 71 cm), built on wheels to allow it to be moved. The coffin was so large that to wheel it out of the inn and to the newly opened burial ground at the rear of St Martin&#x27;s Church, the window and wall of his apartment were demolished. A suitably sized grave had been dug, with a sloping approach to avoid the need to lower the coffin from above, but on 23 June, it nonetheless took almost half an hour for twenty men to pull Lambert&#x27;s enormous coffin into the grave.
Lambert&#x27;s friends paid for a large gravestone, inscribed:

==After death==
In late 1809, John Drakard released &quot;The life of that wonderful and extraordinary heavy man, the late Danl. Lambert, from his birth to the moment of his dissolution, with an account of men noted for their corpulency, and other interesting matter&quot;, the first full biography of Lambert to be released after his death. Lambert&#x27;s position as the heaviest person in recorded history was soon overtaken by the American Mills Darden (1799–1857), but Lambert had by now become a cult figure, and virtually every item connected with him was preserved for posterity. His clothes and possessions were sold at auction to collectors, and many of them are preserved in museums today.

Across England, many public houses and inns were renamed after Daniel Lambert, particularly in Leicester and Stamford. The Daniel Lambert public house at 12 Ludgate Hill, near the entrance to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London, was well known, and had a large portrait of Daniel Lambert and Lambert&#x27;s walking stick on display in the lobby. James Dixon, owner of the Ram Jam Inn in Stamford, bought the suit of clothes Lambert had been wearing when he died and put it on display, renaming the inn the Daniel Lambert.
The term &quot;Daniel Lambert&quot; entered common use in English speech and writing, to refer to any fat man. His name continued in this use long after the details of his life had been largely forgotten; in 1852, Charles Dickens remarked that &quot;Lambert&#x27;s name is known better than his history&quot;. Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; compares the obese George IV to Lambert, and William Makepeace Thackeray used the term in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; to refer to the obese Joseph Sedley, and in &quot;The Luck of Barry Lyndon&quot; to refer to the fat servant Tim. As time progressed, &quot;Daniel Lambert&quot; came to mean anything exceptionally large; Herbert Spencer&#x27;s &quot;The Study of Sociology&quot; used the phrase &quot;a Daniel Lambert of learning&quot;, while Thomas Carlyle referred sarcastically to Oliver Cromwell as &quot;this big swollen Gambler and gluttonous hapless &#x27;spiritual Daniel Lambert&#x27;&quot;. In 1874, &quot;The Times&quot;, in reviewing the newly translated French comedy &quot;La Fiammina&quot; by Mario Uchard in which a character is named &quot;Daniel Lambert&quot;, noted that the name is &quot;always associated in the English mind with the notion of obesity&quot;, and in 1907, almost 100 years after Lambert&#x27;s death, the Château de Chambord was referred to as &quot;the Daniel Lambert among châteaux&quot;. Nellie Lambert Ensall, at the time the heaviest woman in Britain, claimed in 1910 to be Daniel Lambert&#x27;s great-granddaughter, but her claim is likely to be untrue; Lambert was unmarried and is unlikely to have had any children.

In 1838, the &quot;English Annual&quot; published a series of poems, purportedly written by Lambert and found amongst his papers at the Waggon and Horses after his death. No source published during Lambert&#x27;s lifetime mentions his having any interest in poetry or in any reading matter other than periodicals on field sports, and it is unclear why his papers should have been with him in Stamford at his death, rather than at his home in Leicester. The discoverer of the poems is credited only as &quot;Omega&quot;. It is likely that the poems are a hoax.

===P. T. Barnum and General Tom Thumb===
P. T. Barnum and the tall General Tom Thumb (Charles Sherwood Stratton) visited Stamford in 1846 and donated one of Thumb&#x27;s costumes to Dixon to be displayed alongside Lambert&#x27;s. General Tom Thumb visited Stamford again in 1859 and was tied up inside one of Lambert&#x27;s stockings. In 1866, General Tom Thumb, with his equally short wife Lavinia Warren (Mercy Lavinia Warren Bump), her sister Minnie Warren (Huldah Pierce Warren Bump) and Barnum&#x27;s other celebrated dwarf Commodore Nutt (George Washington Morrison Nutt) visited Stamford. All four were able to pass through the knee of Lambert&#x27;s breeches together. In 1866, Lambert&#x27;s and Tom Thumb&#x27;s clothes were sold to the Old London Tavern in Stamford; they were later in the possession of Stamford Museum. (In , it was announced that the Stamford Museum would close in , with its collection transferred to Stamford Library.)

The 1806 waxwork of Lambert was exported to the United States and was on show in New Haven, Connecticut, by 1813. By 1828, the effigy was displayed in the Boston Vauxhall Gardens dressed in a complete set of Lambert&#x27;s clothes. It was later bought by P. T. Barnum and displayed at Barnum&#x27;s American Museum in New York, but the museum was destroyed by fire in 1865 and, although workmen endeavoured to save the waxwork, it melted in the heat and was destroyed.

===In popular memory===
Lambert is still a popular character in Leicester, described in 2009 by the &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot; as &quot;one of the city&#x27;s most cherished icons&quot;; several local public houses and businesses are named after him. Sue Townsend&#x27;s play &quot;The Ghost of Daniel Lambert&quot; featuring Leicester actor Perry Cree, tells the story of how Lambert&#x27;s ghost watches disapprovingly over the 1960s demolition and redevelopment of Leicester&#x27;s historic town centre, premiered at Leicester&#x27;s Haymarket Theatre in 1981. Lambert is also a popular figure in Stamford, and local football team Stamford A.F.C. are nicknamed &quot;The Daniels&quot;, after him.

A set of Lambert&#x27;s clothes, together with his armchair, walking stick, riding crop and prayer book, are on permanent display at the Newarke Houses Museum in Leicester. Stamford Museum exhibited a tailor&#x27;s dummy, dressed with Daniel Lambert&#x27;s clothes as if they are being made up for him, plus his hat and a portrait. The Daniel Lambert pub in Ludgate Hill no longer exists, and the memorabilia formerly displayed there are now on permanent display at the George Hotel in Stamford. The Daniel Lambert pub in Stamford has also closed.

In 2009, on the 200th anniversary of his death, Leicester celebrated Daniel Lambert Day, and over 800 people attended an event in his name at Newarke Houses Museum.

<doc id="420333" wikidata="Q2225555" url="?curid=420333" title="Operation Basalt">
<text>Operation Basalt was a small British raid conducted during World War II on Sark during the German occupation of the Channel Islands.

The objective of the raid was of offensive reconnaissance and capturing prisoners.

==First attempt==
The original plan was for the raid to take place on the night of 18–19 September 1942, and was postponed by a day, due to bad weather. Leaving Portland at 2200 it took longer than planned to reach Sark and &quot;MTB 344&quot; encountered strong currents on the approach, resulting in an arrival time of 0300. The requirement to depart by 0330 in order to be clear of the German occupied islands before dawn resulted in the operation being aborted. &quot;MTB 344&quot; returned safely to Portland at 0530.

==Second attempt==
On the night of 3–4 October 1942 12 men from the Special Operations Executive commanded No. 62 Commando (also known as the &quot;Small Scale Raiding Force&quot;) and No. 12 Commando, left Portland on &quot;MTB 344&quot; at 1900 and landed on Sark with the object of offensive reconnaissance and capturing prisoners.

Climbing the cliff at the Hog&#x27;s Back, between Dixcart Bay and Derrible Bay, the Commandos were not spotted by German sentries nor did they encounter any guards. Several of the raiders broke into the house of a local. The occupant of the house, Mrs Frances Noel Pittard, proved very informative and advised there were about 20 Germans in the annex to the nearby Dixcart Hotel. She also declined an offer to take her to England. Mrs Pittard provided the commandos with documents, including local newspapers from Guernsey.

In front of the hotel was a long hut-type building. There was one guard, who was silently killed by Danish commando Anders Lassen, using the commando knife he carried. This annex comprised a corridor and six rooms wherein were five sleeping Germans, none found to be officers. The men were roused and taken outside whereafter the Commandos decided to go on to the hotel and capture more of the enemy. To minimise the guard left with the captives, the Commandos tied the prisoners&#x27; hands with the six-foot toggle ropes each carried, and required them to hold up their trousers. The practice of removing belts and/or braces and tearing open the fly was quite a common technique the Commandos used to make it as difficult as possible for captives to run away. Most of the prisoners when captured were dressed for sleeping, one was naked and was not allowed to dress.

While this was being undertaken, one prisoner, the naked man, escaped and ran off shouting, a general struggle started with the other prisoners. The prisoners were shouting and, fearing the arrival of enemy troops, the raiders elected to return to the beach with the remaining prisoners. Three prisoners made a break, one was instantly shot dead with a .38 revolver, another prisoner, wounded, managed to escape. Whether or not some had freed their hands during the firefight is not established nor if all three broke at the same time. Two were believed shot and one stabbed by Ogden-Brown. The sole remaining prisoner, &quot;Obergefreiter&quot; Hermann Weinreich, was conveyed safely to England and provided useful information.

Germans on the island were alerted, however the Commandos managed to climb down the cliff, then using their small boat, returned to &quot;MTB 344&quot; and made their escape with no injuries.

Three German soldiers had died: the sentry and two prisoners.

===Consequences===
A few days later, the Germans issued a communiqué implying at least one prisoner had escaped and two were shot while resisting having their hands tied. This came shortly after the Dieppe Raid where an Allied document reportedly instructed prisoners&#x27; hands to be tied. When this was brought to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s attention, he ordered the shackling of Canadian prisoners, which led to a reciprocating order by British and Canadian authorities for German prisoners being held in Canada.

It is also believed that this raid contributed to Hitler&#x27;s decision to issue his Commando Order on 18 October 1942 instructing all captured Commandos or Commando-type personnel be executed as a matter of procedure. This order resulted in a number of war crimes being committed.

The newspapers recovered from Sark gave details of the deportation of civilians to Germany, this was the first evidence the British had seen of potential German war crimes in the occupied Channel Islands. The Germans justified the action as being identical to the Allied removal of German civilians from Persia, current day Iran, to Australia that had taken place in 1941. No prosecution took place.

The raid resulted in increased security measures being taken in Sark, mainly through an increase in the number of mines, to 13,000, being laid and the deportation to Germany of 201 Channel Island civilians with 48 Sark civilians, including Mrs Pittard, who had just completed a three-month jail term and Robert Hathaway, the husband of the Dame of Sark, in February 1943. Dame Sybil Hathaway remarked on the raid as it &quot;seemed a heavy price to pay for the capture of one prisoner and a copy of the &quot;Guernsey Evening Press&quot;&quot;.

===Participants on second attempt===
Names of the soldiers who are known to have participated in the raid:
* Major Geoffrey Appleyard
* Captain Philip Pinckney (later of 2nd SAS – see also Operation Speedwell)
* Lieut. Anders Lassen (later Major, VC, MC — see also Operation Roast)
* Patrick Dudgeon
* Colin Ogden Smith
* Bruce Ogden Smith
* Graham Young
* James Edgar
* Sergeant Horace &#x27;Brummie&#x27; Stokes (later of 2nd SAS – see also Operation Speedwell)
* Corporal Flint
* Bombardier Eric Forster
* Sergeant Joseph &quot;Tim&quot; Robinson (later of 2nd SAS – see also Operation Speedwell)

A Private Redborn claimed to be on the raid, however no official records of anyone under this name exists. 

==Subsequent raids==
David Niven, who participated in Channel raids, stated in his autobiography &quot;The Moon&#x27;s a Balloon&quot; that the commandos who landed on Sark were taken to the local pub by the locals for a drink. However, Niven also erroneously stated that there were no German troops on Sark at the time. Niven&#x27;s account is almost certainly a reference to Operation Ambassador in July 1940 when 140 men from No. 3 Commando and No. 11 Independent Company landed on Little Sark by mistake, thinking they had landed on Guernsey as part of a larger force. They found no Germans and eventually returned to their boat, but there are no reports of them meeting with locals or drinking with them.

More than a year later, in December 1943, there was a follow-up raid on Sark by a team of British and French commandos known as Operation Hardtack 7. It was a complete failure as two of the four men were killed by German mines as they attempted to cross the Hog&#x27;s Back, following the same route as the commandos had done in 1942—a known route which was now heavily mined.

== Memorial ==
On the 80th anniversary of the raid, in 2022, a memorial was unveiled to the raid, on the cliff top in Sark.

<text>The West Australian is the only locally edited daily newspaper published in Perth, Western Australia. It is owned by Seven West Media (SWM), as is the state&#x27;s other major newspaper, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. It is the second-oldest continuously produced newspaper in Australia, having been published since 1833. It tends to have conservative leanings, and has mostly supported the Liberal–National Party Coalition. It has Australia&#x27;s largest share of market penetration (84% of WA) of any newspaper in the country.

== Content ==
&quot;The West Australian&quot; publishes international, national and local news. , newsgathering was integrated with the TV news and current-affairs operations of &quot;Seven News&quot;, Perth, which moved its news staff to the paper&#x27;s Osborne Park premises. SWM also publishes two websites from Osborne Park—thewest.com.au and PerthNow.
The daily newspaper includes lift-outs including Play Magazine, The Guide, West Weekend, and Body and Soul. Thewest.com.au is the online version of the daily newspaper, available only to subscribers.

=== Political leanings ===
&quot;The West Australian&quot; leans right wing politically. An editorial published on 25 April 2022 claimed that the newspaper was &quot;economically conservative, but socially progressive&quot;. For every federal election from 1922 to 1969, the newspaper endorsed the conservative Coalition. At the state election held in March 2017, the newspaper&#x27;s editorial endorsed the Australian Labor Party opposition, led by Mark McGowan, over the Liberal–National government led by Colin Barnett. &quot;The West Australian&quot; endorsed the Coalition at the 2019 Australian federal election, Labor in the 2021 state election, and the Coalition at the 2022 Australian federal election. During the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;The West Australian&quot; supported the McGowan Labor Government up until 20 January 2022, when the decision was made to delay the reopening of interstate borders, locking Seven West Media Chairman Kerry Stokes, who was on an overseas trip, out of the state. Following this, the newspaper has been highly critical of McGowan&#x27;s COVID-19 response.

===Endorsements===
==Presentation==
Formerly a conservative &quot;daily paper of record&quot;, &quot;The West&quot; has adopted the style of a popular tabloid. It has very ably utilised colour printing and its monopolist status to maximise display advertising including the use of multi-page advertorial supplements and loose inserts. Advertising is frequently accorded priority over news on the front page by means of a four-page wrap-around cover section.

== Audience ==
, refraining from reporting greatly reduced print circulation, the paper claimed &quot;readership across print and online platforms&quot; of 1.8 million per month (a daily average of less than 70,000). &quot;The West Australian&quot; recorded a significant fall of nearly 25% in profit in June 2016. A serious drop in circulation was also reported, with average weekday circulation down from 157,000 to 145,000, while the weekend edition averaged 241,000, down from 258,000. Cost-saving measures, such as staff redundancies, were attributed to the poor performance.

In 2021, audited &quot;cross-platform readership&quot; of &quot;The West&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; combined was 4.1 million per month. In February 2022, Seven West Media WA chief executive Maryna Fewster announced growth to 4.5 million per month boosted by (potentially duplicated) counts of hits on subsidiary websites including PerthNow, the video program &quot;Up Late&quot;, morning radio show &quot;The West Live&quot;, and sundry video packages launched on thewest.com.au.

==Ownership==

&quot;The West Australian&quot; was owned by the publicly listed company West Australian Newspapers from the 1920s. In 1969, the Melbourne based Herald &amp; Weekly Times bought WAN and published the paper until 1987 when it was sold to Robert Holmes à Court&#x27;s Bell Group, when the remainder of H&amp;WT was bought by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation. The following year Alan Bond, through Bond Corporation, gained control of Bell Group and hence the paper. This ownership structure only survived for a few years until the collapse of Bond Corporation. A newly formed company, &quot;West Australian Newspapers Holdings&quot;, then purchased the paper from the receivers before being floated in an oversubscribed $185 million public offering. The company was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange on 9 January 1992. A management fee of $217,000 and underwriting/brokers handling fee of $1.9 million were paid to companies associated with former short-term directors John Poynton and J. H. Nickson. After acquiring the Seven Media Group in April 2011, West Australian Newspapers Holdings became Seven West Media, Australia&#x27;s largest diversified media business.

== History ==

&quot;The West Australian&quot; traces its origins to The Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal, the first edition of which appeared on 5 January 1833. Owned and edited by Perth postmaster Charles Macfaull, it was originally a four-page weekly. It was, at first, published on Saturdays, but changed to Fridays in 1864. From 7 October 1864 it was known as The Perth Gazette and Western Australian Times and was published by Arthur Shenton, until 24 March 1871, after which the publisher was Joseph Mitchell, until 29 September 1871. The new publisher, M. Shenton, remained in place until 26 June 1874. when it was bought by a syndicate who renamed it The Western Australian Times and who in September 1874 increased production to two editions a week. On 18 November 1879, it was relaunched as The West Australian. In October 1883, production was increased to three editions per week; two years later it became a daily publication. The proprietors of the &quot;West Australian&quot; at that time also inaugurated the &quot;Western Mail&quot;, in 1885. Initially, delivery of the paper beyond settled areas was problematic, but the growth and development of the rural railway system in the early 1900s facilitated wider circulation.

In September 2015 the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission approved the acquisition of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, which would give Seven West Media a monopoly over major newspapers in the state. Finalisation of the deal, which includes the website PerthNow, was announced by &quot;The West Australian&quot; on 8 November 2016. In May 2019, SWM acquired Community Newspaper Group, adding 13 titles to the newspaper suite in WA, and have since moved all of the community websites onto the PerthNow website. In June 2019, &quot;The West Australian&quot; began putting some of its website content behind a subscription paywall.

=== Locations ===

In 1933, &quot;The West Australian&quot; moved to the purpose-built Newspaper House on St Georges Terrace in Perth. It included an office and publishing plant, and was a prominent landmark in the life of the city and state for more than 50 years. Newspaper House was vacated in the mid-1980s for the ill-fated &quot;Westralia Square&quot; redevelopment which was completed in 2012 under the name Brookfield Place. The editorial staff was temporarily relocated in a nearby office building. Recognised as part of an important heritage precinct, Newspaper House was scheduled for preservation and refurbishment. In 1988, larger and more modern accommodation for the paper&#x27;s printing presses was commissioned in Osborne Park. In 1998, the editorial operations also moved to the Osborne Park complex.

=== Publications ===
In the 1940s and later, the newspaper published more than twenty editions of Charles Gardner&#x27;s West Australian wildflowers.
At various stages in its history, the newspaper had a periodicals division that has published calendars, gardening books, and collections of historical photographs.

In 1954, to celebrate the visit of Queen Elizabeth II, a souvenir program was produced.

On 27 May 2022, as part the National Reconciliation Week, the paper under the title of Marawar Boodjara, published a special wraparound where the front cover was written bilingually in the local Indigenous language of the area, Noongar and English. This was helped by the newspaper&#x27;s resident Noongar linguist, Alison Nannup. This received praised from many quarters including the prime minister. This was repeated the next year, on 28 May 2023.

== Controversies ==
The first book published in Western Australia, &quot;Report of the Late Trial for Libel!!! Clarke versus MacFaul&quot; (Fremantle, 1835), by the future editor of the &quot;Swan River Guardian&quot; William Nairne Clark, concerned a libel case brought against the editor of the &quot;Perth Gazette&quot;, Charles Macfaull, by the accusations of incompetence and impugned character printed in regard to a Captain Clark. A letter of apology was refused and the court awarded damages of £27 to the captain of the vessel. Macfaull maintained his reputation although his resources were significantly reduced by the verdict.

In February 2005 former Australian Labor prime minister Bob Hawke labelled the paper &quot;a disgrace to reasonable objective journalism&quot;. Academic Peter van Onselen substantiated this attack, identifying 10 pro-Opposition front-page headlines in the lead-up to the 2005 state election, but no pro-Government headlines.

In May 2007, then attorney-general and health minister in the State Labor government, Jim McGinty, described the newspaper as &quot;the nation&#x27;s most inaccurate and dishonest newspaper&quot;. He went on to attack the editor, Paul Armstrong, saying that &quot;the board of West Australian Newspapers needs to sack the editor. It is personally driven by a particular individual&quot;. Armstrong responded by saying he &quot;could not give a fat rat&#x27;s arse&quot; about Mr McGinty&#x27;s comments and was then virulently attacked by premier Alan Carpenter, whose government the paper continued to denigrate until its defeat at the 2008 election.

On 8 December 2014 the management of West Australian Newspapers announced that printed editions of &quot;The West Australian&quot; would no longer be available in retail outlets located north of Broome in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, including towns such as Derby, Halls Creek, Fitzroy Crossing, Wyndham and Kununurra, due to the expense of transporting and delivering printed newspapers.

<text>The term ideal machine refers to a hypothetical mechanical system in which energy and power are not lost or dissipated through friction, deformation, wear, or other inefficiencies. Ideal machines have the theoretical maximum performance, and therefore are used as a baseline for evaluating the performance of real machine systems.

A simple machine, such as a lever, pulley, or gear train, is &quot;ideal&quot; if the power input is equal to the power output of the device, which means there are no losses. In this case, the mechanical efficiency is 100%.

Mechanical efficiency is the performance of the machine compared to its theoretical maximum as performed by an ideal machine. The mechanical efficiency of a simple machine is calculated by dividing the actual power output by the ideal power output. This is usually expressed as a percentage.

Power loss in a real system can occur in many ways, such as through friction, deformation, wear, heat losses, incomplete chemical conversion, magnetic and electrical losses.

==Criteria==
A machine consists of a power source and a mechanism for the controlled use of this power. The power source often relies on chemical conversion to generate heat which is then used to generate power. Each stage of the process of power generation has a maximum performance limit which is identified as ideal.

Once the power is generated the mechanism components of the machine direct it toward useful forces and movement. The ideal mechanism does not absorb any power, which means the power input is equal to the power output.

An example is the automobile engine (internal combustion engine) which burns fuel (an exothermic chemical reaction) inside a cylinder and uses the expanding gases to drive a piston. The movement of the piston rotates the crank shaft. The remaining mechanical components such as the transmission, drive shaft, differential, axles and wheels form the power transmission mechanism that directs the power from the engine into friction forces on the road to move the automobile.

&quot;The ideal machine has the maximum energy conversion performance combined with a lossless power transmission mechanism that yields maximum performance.&quot;

<text>During World War II, Operation Begonia was the airborne counterpart to the amphibious Operation Jonquil, conducted by British SAS and Eighth Army Airborne between Ancona and Pescara, Italy, from 2–6 October 1943. The operational force comprised 61 men.

== Objective ==
The object was to locate escaped POWs in the interior and muster them on beach locations for extraction. &quot;Begonia&quot; involved the interior parachute drop by four parties of Airborne and one party of 2 SAS. &quot;Jonquil&quot; entailed four seaborne beach parties from 2 SAS with the French SAS Squadron as protection.

== Outcome ==
Faults in planning and the omission of radios resulted in hundreds of POWs being located and forwarded to the beaches, but only 50 meeting with the beach parties and being evacuated.</text><links>

*6 January – India arrests four Kashmiri terrorists in connection with the week-long hijacking in December.
*24 February – A review of national security was ordered, after an expert committee&#x27;s report on the incursion of Pakistani-backed forces into Kashmir in mid-1999 exposed serious shortcomings. The Subramanyam committee recommends a new &quot;national security planning and decision-making structure for India in the nuclear age&quot;. Fresh clashes are reported in late February along the Line of Control between Indian- and Pakistani-administered Kashmir.
*Late February – Parliamentary sessions are disrupted by protests led by the opposition Indian National Congress party, complaining that civil servants (who may not join political organizations) are being allowed to join the Hindu nationalist organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in some states. Congress accuses the RSS of promoting intolerance and says the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government was pursuing a secret RSS-inspired agenda whereby India could cease to be a secular state.
*Late February – The BJP-led government&#x27;s first budget since its October 1999 election victory was criticized by foreign investors for failing to impose tighter curbs on state subsidies. Despite the rising government deficit, there was to be a big increase in military spending, reflecting tension with Pakistan. This will be financed in part by surcharges on income tax and corporation tax.
*20 March – Pakistan agrees to the construction of the long-discussed gas pipeline which will transport natural gas from Iran to India via Pakistan.
*20 March – US President Bill Clinton makes a groundbreaking visit to improve ties
*20 March – 36 Sikh killed in Kashmir

*1 June – 2000 – Pen Power, an Encyclopedia of published letters to the editors from some 200 letter writers was released by M.V.Kamath, Chairperson of Prasar Bharati. The veteran journalist declares that Pen-Power should be prescribed as a text book in all Journalism colleges. 
*Early June – Clashes between security forces and terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir kill 17 people. Violence in the region has become a daily occurrence as it also has in the far-eastern state of Tripura where killings of Bengalis by Christian separatist rebels have prompted the deployment of an extra 3,000 paramilitary troops by the government.
*Mid-June – Prime Minister Vajpayee approves a measure to provide 320,000 government employees with free telephones. India has only 26 phone lines per 1,000 people.

*Mid-June – London-based human rights group Amnesty International criticizes India, along with Bangladesh and Pakistan, for insufficiently protecting the rights of women, who, it says, are subjected to negative bias in investigations of abuse.
*16 June – 34 lower-caste Hindus are killed in the northeastern state of Bihar; eight suspects are arrested two days later. The massacre was believed to be a revenge killing for 12 upper-caste Hindus who were killed a week before. The banned private army Ranvir Sena was believed to have been responsible for the latest killing and for 350 other deaths since 1994.
*Mid-June – Archaeologists announce a significant discovery of treasure believed to be around 5,000 years old in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. The jewelry was thought to belong to a civilization from the Indus Valley not previously thought to have spread so far afield.
*Late June – The government announces plans to subsidize health insurance for the &quot;poorest of the poor&quot;.
*Late June – Eight executives from the independent television station Channel V are arrested and charged with obscenity and indecency after screening a program in which two teenage girls were encouraged to strip on the streets of Mumbai for a small cash incentive.
*24 June – Almost 1 billion people worldwide reportedly tune in to watch the International Indian Film Awards held at the Millennium Dome in London, England. The Indian film industry, known as Bollywood, has its second-largest following in the UK, mostly amongst the country&#x27;s ethnic Indian population, but receives little attention from the British press.
*26 June – The state assembly of Jammu and Kashmir angers the federal government when it resolves to ask for a return of the region&#x27;s autonomous status which was revoked in 1953. The government refuses to discuss the proposal in parliament in early July and rejects the calls outright.

*Early July – Wildlife experts announce an investigation into the mysterious sudden deaths of 12 of the 56 rare Royal Bengal tigers in Nandankanan Zoo in Orissa. There are thought to be fewer than 4,000 tigers in the wild in India.
*Mid-July – The UN&#x27;s Population Fund condemns the government for its lack of commitment to tackle the imbalance between numbers of males and females in the country which it was thought was largely due to the feticide and infanticide of baby girls. There are estimated to be 960 women to every 1,000 men.
*Mid-July – A landslide in Mumbai&#x27;s slum district kills at least 60 people after torrential rain. A further 200 people are feared lost under the rubble.

*22 July – The government announces the launch of a National Population Stabilization Fund to help promote family planning programs in the country, especially in the northern states which contain half of all Indians. The population officially passed the 1 billion mark on 11 May, although the UN believes that figure had already been reached on 15 August 1999.
*23 July – Minister for Law Ram Jethmalani resigns from the cabinet blaming strained relations with Attorney General Soli Sorabjee.
*Late July – Bal Thackeray, leader of the far-right Shiv Sena group, was released within hours of his arrest.

The Maharashtra state government, whose decision to press the charges had prompted threats from Shiv Sena supporters to disrupt commerce in Mumbai, says it will appeal against the ruling.
*Late July – Thousands of police officers in the crime-plagued eastern state of Bihar go on strike to demand better compensation for the families of fallen comrades, and less &quot;political interference&quot; in their work.

*27 July - Nanoor massacre by Communist Party of India (Marxist) workers in West Bengal. 
*30 July – The Indian film idol Rajkumar was part of a group taken hostage by a notorious Karnataka bandit known as Veerappan. A popular outcry places the state government under strong pressure to negotiate Rajkumar&#x27;s release, but in August the Supreme Court rules out a deal involving the release of imprisoned members of Veerappan&#x27;s elephant poaching and timber smuggling band. One of Rajkumar&#x27;s fellow hostages manages to escape from his captors on 28 September
*1 August – Bangaru Laxman, a junior minister in the cabinet, was appointed as the new president of the ruling BJP. Laxman was the first lower-caste Hindu and southern Indian to hold the position and says he will look to expand the party&#x27;s support base in the south. As a known moderate it was thought he will also seek to mend strained relations with the Hindu right.
*Early August – Around 90 Hindus are massacred by Muslim separatists in Indian-administered Kashmir. The violence was thought to be a hostile reaction to peace initiatives begun by the largest separatist group Hizbul Mujahideen.

*Early August – Thousands of women demonstrate in New Delhi in support of the government&#x27;s proposed &quot;reservations bill&quot; which will guarantee women one-third of all parliamentary seats. Pressure groups note that despite the prime minister&#x27;s promises the bill has not been listed on the current parliamentary schedule.
*8 August – A ceasefire initiated on 24 July between the government and the Kashmiri separatist group Hizbul Mujahideen falls apart after only 15 days after accusations that the government has fired on some of the group&#x27;s members. Prime Minister Vajpayee urges that his government was still prepared to discuss peace initiatives but states that any deal will have to be worked out within the framework of the Indian constitution, which Hizbul Mujahideen has flatly rejected as a basis for peace. The government also refuses to address the group&#x27;s key demand that Pakistan be involved in any talks.
*Late August – The regionalist debate was invigorated by government proposals to share out the revenue of the various states. Delegates from ten states meet with the prime minister to urge him to drop the proposals. They claim the policy will penalize states which have managed to increase revenue through hard-won reforms.
*Late August – Over 100 people die in severe monsoon rains in southern India. In the face of the torrential downpour more than 50,000 people are evacuated, mostly from Hyderabad which receives over half of its average annual rainfall in 24 hours.

*Early September – The onslaught against overpopulation continues in the western state of Maharashtra when the state&#x27;s government decides to withhold benefits from May 2001 for families with more than two children. A two-child maximum was already a prerequisite for employment by the state, and the authorities are also considering enforcing a law to prevent women from marrying under the age of 18.
*Mid-September – The environmentalist group Greenpeace criticizes the government for not doing enough to enforce regulations banning the dumping of international toxic waste in India.
*Mid-September – The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that 1 billion people worldwide are regularly exposed to levels of air pollution 100 times greater than recommended guidelines. The greatest risk was from the use of solid fuel in poor households, rather than from industrial smog in large cities. It notes that 500,000 children from rural areas die every year from respiratory infections in India where 80% of homes use solid fuel for cooking and heating.
*September – On average in India 24 women are raped every day and 14 killed to &quot;protect their family&#x27;s honour&quot; according to the UN&#x27;s latest State of the World&#x27;s Population report. It also reveals that 40% of Indian women are subjected to domestic violence.
*Late September – India and South Africa sign a defense cooperation agreement in Cape Town covering peacekeeping, weapons development and procurement, and counter-terrorism. South Africa hopes that India&#x27;s experience in peacekeeping can be applied in conflict resolution in southern Africa.
*29 September – Newspapers hail the conviction of former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao as a landmark moment in Indian law. He was found guilty of corruption in a bribery scandal dating from 1993 and the decision was interpreted by the press as a clear signal that high rank does not provide legal protection.
*End of September – Flooding in eastern states has left many millions homeless and has killed 850 people in the state of West Bengal alone.
*30 September – The Communist Party of India - Marxist (CPI-M), the third largest party at federal level, has its status as a &quot;national&quot; party revoked by the electoral commission. The move was a serious threat to the party which controls two states outright, including the populous state of West Bengal, and was the leading coalition partner in another.
*Early October – A senior Hindu leader urges the government to establish a national Christian church and expel foreign missionaries. The country&#x27;s Christian community was often subject to violent intimidation from extremist Hindu activists.
*3 October – Prime Minister Vajpayee signs a bilateral agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin to increase ties between the two countries including cooperation on issues of defense.
*Mid-October – The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) revises its predictions, lowering the forecast rate of economic growth for 2000 from 7% to 5.8%.
*Mid-October – The chief minister of the northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh complains that Chinese soldiers are making regular forays across the agreed Line of Actual Control to harass villagers. The Chinese government dismisses the claims as inaccurate.
*Mid-October – A court in the western state of Gujarat rules in favour of the vertical extension of the controversial Sardar Sarovar dam on the River Narmada. Work on the dam was halted in 1994 due to strong local objections. Supporters of the project point to the beneficial effects of more water for the drought-plagued region and an increase in hydroelectric power while opponents argue that the subsequent displacement of thousands of villagers around the river was insupportable.
*1 November – Chhattisgarh, carved out of Madhya Pradesh, becomes India&#x27;s 26th state.

*Early November – Syed Salahuddin, leader of the Kashmiri separatist group Hizbul Mujahideen, calls on Muslim nations to cut ties with India and says the group will not renew a unilateral ceasefire. It calls for the Indian government to officially recognize that Jammu and Kashmir was a disputed territory and for any further negotiations to include the Pakistani government and the people of Kashmir.
*Mid-November – Three months of extreme embarrassment for the state governments of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka end when the notorious aging bandit Veerappan suddenly releases an even older veteran actor, Rajkumar, he had held captive since August. The authorities, keenly aware of the popularity of Rajkumar, agreed in August to grant some of Veerappan&#x27;s demands which included the official recognition of Tamil as a language used in business in Karnataka, and the release of prisoners held under strict anti-terrorist laws. It remains unclear what exactly prompted the release of Rajkumar.
*15 November – Sonia Gandhi easily wins reelection as leader of the Congress (I) party, beating Jitendra Prasada by 7,448 votes to 94. Prasada was the first person to challenge a member of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty which has dominated Congress since the 1950s.
*15 November – Jharkhand, carved out of Bihar, becomes India&#x27;s 28th state.

*Late November – Ten people, including three Indian soldiers, are killed in a landmine attack in Kashmir on the first day of a government ceasefire held to coincide with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The terrorist group Hizbul Mujahideen claim responsibility for the attack condemning the ceasefire as a publicity stunt intended to win over international opinion.
*Late November – India&#x27;s central vigilance commissioner N. Vittal declares that the country&#x27;s entire political system depends on illegal funding.
*1 December – Miss India first runner-up Priyanka Chopra wins the Miss World 2000 title.
*2 December – Pakistan offers to exercise &quot;maximum restraint&quot; in contested border areas of Kashmir as a beginning to negotiations with the Indian authorities. India insists that before there can be talks there must be a complete cessation of firing across the Line of Control.
*Early December – Political turmoil was ignited by the anniversary of the destruction of a mosque by Hindu extremists at Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, in 1992. It leads to calls for the resignation of Prime Minister Vajpayee and leaves the lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha, in stalemate. Vajpayee suggests that the construction of a Hindu temple on the site of the mosque, reputedly the birthplace of a Hindu deity, was &quot;an expression of national yearning&quot;.
*17 December – An alliance of Kashmiri separatists, the Hurriyat, begin talks to discuss a unified response to the Indian government&#x27;s ceasefire but divisions between the factions drag the conference into a second day.
*20 December – In response to the Indian government&#x27;s extension of its unilateral ceasefire in Kashmir for a further month, the Pakistani authorities announce that they will partially withdraw troops from the disputed line of control.
*Late December – Relations with Pakistan are damaged when Prime Minister Vajpayee accuses the Pakistani authorities of being behind threats made by the extremist Kashmiri separatist group Lashkar-e-Toiba against his own person. The group, which was based in Pakistan, launched a surprise attack on the historic Red Fort in Delhi on 22 December, killing three people and undermining Vajpayee&#x27;s Ramadan ceasefire, which had been extended for an extra month two days earlier.

<doc id="420341" wikidata="Q159619" url="?curid=420341" title="James Stirling (architect)">
<text>Sir James Frazer Stirling (22 April 1926 – 25 June 1992) was a British architect.

Stirling worked in partnership with James Gowan from 1956 to 1963, then with Michael Wilford from 1971 until 1992.

==Early life and education==

Stirling was born in Glasgow. His year of birth is widely quoted as 1926 but his longstanding friend Sir Sandy Wilson later stated it was 1924. The family moved to Liverpool when James was an infant, where he attended Quarry Bank High School. After leaving school, he studied at the School of Art in Liverpool between 1940-41, while working in an architect&#x27;s office.
During World War II, he joined the Black Watch before transferring to the Parachute Regiment. He was parachuted behind German enemy lines before D-Day and was wounded twice, before returning to Britain.

Stirling studied architecture from 1945 until 1950 at the University of Liverpool, where Colin Rowe was a tutor.
He worked in a number of firms in London before establishing his own practice. From 1952 to 1956 he worked with Lyons, Israel, Ellis in London where he met his first partner James Gowan. Lyons, Israel, Ellis was considered one of the most influential post war practices at that time, focusing on buildings for the Welfare State with architects such as Alan Colquhoun and John Miller, Neave Brown, Sue Martin, Richard MacCormac all of whom went on to architectural prominence. Stirling worked on a number of school buildings including Peckham Girl&#x27;s Comprehensive School. When he and James Gowan started their own practice Lyons Israel Ellis gave them part of their Preston housing project, helping to establish their reputation for innovative design.

==Career==

In 1956 he and James Gowan left their positions as assistants with the firm of Lyons, Israel, and Ellis to set up a practice as Stirling and Gowan. Their first built project – a small development of private apartments Langham House Close (1955–58) – was regarded as a landmark in the development of &#x27;brutalist&#x27; residential architecture, although this was a description both architects rejected. Another result of Stirling &amp; Gowan&#x27;s collaboration is the Department of Engineering building at the University of Leicester (1959–63), noted for its technological and geometric character, marked by the use of three-dimensional drawings based on axonometric projection seen either from above (in a bird&#x27;s eye view) or below (in a worm&#x27;s eye view). The project brought Stirling to a global audience.
In 1963, Stirling and Gowan separated; Stirling then set up on his own, taking with him the office assistant Michael Wilford (who later became a partner). Stirling then oversaw two projects: the History Faculty Library at the University of Cambridge and the Florey Building accommodation block for The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford. He also completed a training centre for Olivetti in Haslemere, Surrey and housing for the University of St Andrews both of which made prominent use of pre-fabricated elements, GRP for Olivetti and pre-cast concrete panels at St Andrews.
During the 1970s, Stirling&#x27;s architectural language began to change as the scale of his projects moved from small (and not very profitable) to very large. His architecture became more overtly neoclassical, though it remained deeply imbued with modernism. This produced a wave of large-scale urban projects, most notably three museum projects for Düsseldorf, Cologne, and Stuttgart. Winning the design competition for the Neue Staatsgalerie, it came to be seen as an example of postmodernism, a label which stuck but which he himself rejected, and was considered by many to be his most important work.

As part of the worldwide expansion of Stirling and Wilford&#x27;s practice beginning in the 1970s, the firm completed four significant buildings in the U.S., all university structures: an addition for the Rice University School of Architecture in Houston, Texas; the Arthur M. Sackler Museum at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts; the Schwartz Center for the Performing Arts at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York; and the Biological Sciences Library at the University of California, Irvine. Among unrealized projects in the US are designs for Columbia University and a competition proposal for the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles.
In 1981, Stirling was awarded the Pritzker Prize. Stirling received a series of important commissions in England – the Clore Gallery for the Turner Collection at the Tate Britain, London (1980–87); the Tate Liverpool (1984, but since then heavily altered and no longer recognisable as a Stirling project). The last building he completed during his life was the Venice Biennale Bookshop (1989-91, with Thomas Muirhead). (No 1 Poultry in London (1986) was completed by others, posthumously). 

In June 1992, Stirling was awarded a knighthood. After consulting with Michael Wilford, he accepted the award on the grounds that it might help their practice.

==Personal life==
In 1966 Stirling married the designer Mary Shand, the stepdaughter of the writer P. Morton Shand. They had one son and two daughters.

==Death and legacy==
Three days after the announcement of his knighthood, Stirling was hospitalised in London with a painful hernia. He died on 25 June 1992 following surgical complications. In accordance with his wishes, his ashes were buried near to his memorial at Christ Church, Spitalfields. After Stirling&#x27;s death, Michael Wilford (who had become a partner in 1971) continued the practice.

The Stirling Prize, a British annual prize for architecture since 1996, was named after him.

Many architects admire Stirling&#x27;s work, but opinion has been divided. After Stirling&#x27;s death, Italian architect and critic Vittorio Gregotti wrote that &quot;from now on, everything will be more difficult&quot;. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Andrew Saint called Stirling &quot;A fearless experimentalist, a memorable innovator in form and a pungent character,&quot; but declared that, &quot;he lacked the inner maturity, the breadth of reflection and the depth of discipline required for the highest level of architectural achievement.&quot; Rather more cuttingly, Jonathan Meades says that &quot;His buildings, like their bombastic maker, looked tough but were perpetual invalids, basket cases.&quot;

<text>Wikisource is an online wiki-based digital library of free-content textual sources operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikisource is the name of the project as a whole; it is also the name for each instance of that project, one for each language. The project&#x27;s aim is to host all forms of free text, in many languages, and translations. Originally conceived as an archive to store useful or important historical texts, it has expanded to become a general-content library. The project officially began on November 24, 2003, under the name Project Sourceberg, a play on Project Gutenberg. The name Wikisource was adopted later that year and it received its own domain name.

The project holds works that are either in the public domain or freely licensed; professionally published works or historical source documents, not vanity products. Verification was initially made offline, or by trusting the reliability of other digital libraries. Now works are supported by online scans via the ProofreadPage extension, which ensures the reliability and accuracy of the project&#x27;s texts.

Some individual Wikisources, each representing a specific language, now only allow works backed up with scans. While the bulk of its collection are texts, Wikisource as a whole hosts other media, from comics to film to audiobooks. Some Wikisources allow user-generated annotations, subject to the specific policies of the Wikisource in question. The project has come under criticism for lack of reliability but it is also cited by organisations such as the National Archives and Records Administration.

As of 2025, there are Wikisource subdomains active for languages comprising a total of articles and recently active editors.

==History==
The original concept for Wikisource was as storage for useful or important historical texts. These texts were intended to support Wikipedia articles, by providing primary evidence and original source texts, and as an archive in its own right. The collection was initially focused on important historical and cultural material, distinguishing it from other digital archives like Project Gutenberg.

The project was originally called Project Sourceberg during its planning stages (a play on words for Project Gutenberg).

In 2001, there was a dispute on Wikipedia regarding the addition of primary-source materials, leading to edit wars over their inclusion or deletion. Project Sourceberg was suggested as a solution to this. In describing the proposed project, user The Cunctator said, &quot;It would be to Project Gutenberg what Wikipedia is to Nupedia&quot;, soon clarifying the statement with &quot;we don&#x27;t want to try to duplicate Project Gutenberg&#x27;s efforts; rather, we want to complement them. Perhaps Project Sourceberg can mainly work as an interface for easily linking from Wikipedia to a Project Gutenberg file, and as an interface for people to easily submit new work to PG.&quot; Initial comments were skeptical, with Larry Sanger questioning the need for the project, writing &quot;The hard question, I guess, is why we are reinventing the wheel, when Project Gutenberg already exists? We&#x27;d want to complement Project Gutenberg—how, exactly?&quot;, and Jimmy Wales adding &quot;like Larry, I&#x27;m interested that we think it over to see what we can add to Project Gutenberg. It seems unlikely that primary sources should in general be editable by anyone — I mean, Shakespeare is Shakespeare, unlike our commentary on his work, which is whatever we want it to be.&quot;

The project began its activity at ps.wikipedia.org. The contributors understood the &quot;PS&quot; subdomain to mean either &quot;primary sources&quot; or Project Sourceberg. However, this resulted in Project Sourceberg occupying the subdomain of the Pashto Wikipedia (the ISO language code of the Pashto language is &quot;ps&quot;).

Project Sourceberg officially launched on November 24, 2003, when it received its own temporary URL, at sources.wikipedia.org, and all texts and discussions hosted on ps.wikipedia.org were moved to the temporary address. A vote on the project&#x27;s name changed it to Wikisource on December 6, 2003. Despite the change in name, the project did not move to its permanent URL () until July 23, 2004.
==Logo and slogan==
Since Wikisource was initially called &quot;Project Sourceberg&quot;, its first logo was a picture of an iceberg. Two votes conducted to choose a successor were inconclusive, and the original logo remained until 2006. Finally, for both legal and technical reasons—because the picture&#x27;s license was inappropriate for a Wikimedia Foundation logo and because a photo cannot scale properly—a stylized vector iceberg inspired by the original picture was mandated to serve as the project&#x27;s logo.

The first prominent use of Wikisource&#x27;s slogan—&quot;The Free Library&quot;—was at the project&#x27;s multilingual portal, when it was redesigned based upon the Wikipedia portal on August 27, 2005, (historical version). As in the Wikipedia portal the Wikisource slogan appears around the logo in the project&#x27;s ten largest languages.

Clicking on the portal&#x27;s central images (the iceberg logo in the center and the &quot;Wikisource&quot; heading at the top of the page) links to a &quot;list of translations&quot; for &quot;Wikisource&quot; and &quot;The Free Library&quot; in 60 languages.

==Tools built==

A MediaWiki extension called ProofreadPage was developed for Wikisource by developer ThomasV to improve the vetting of transcriptions by the project. This displays pages of scanned works side by side with the text relating to that page, allowing the text to be proofread and its accuracy later verified independently by any other editor. Once a book, or other text, has been scanned, the raw images can be modified with image processing software to correct for page rotations and other problems. The retouched images can then be converted into a PDF or DjVu file and uploaded to either Wikisource or Wikimedia Commons.

This system assists editors in ensuring the accuracy of texts on Wikisource. The original page scans of completed works remain available to any user so that errors may be corrected later and readers may check texts against the originals. ProofreadPage also allows greater participation, since access to a physical copy of the original work is not necessary to be able to contribute to the project once images have been uploaded.

==Milestones==

Within two weeks of the project&#x27;s official start at sources.wikipedia.org, over 1,000 pages had been created, with approximately 200 of these being designated as actual articles. On January 4, 2004, Wikisource welcomed its 100th registered user. In early July, 2004 the number of articles exceeded 2,400, and more than 500 users had registered.

On April 30, 2005, there were 2667 registered users (including 18 administrators) and almost 19,000 articles. The project passed its 96,000th edit that same day.

On November 27, 2005, the English Wikisource passed 20,000 text-units in its third month of existence, already holding more texts than did the entire project in April (before the move to language subdomains).

On May 10, 2006, the first Wikisource Portal was created.

On February 14, 2008, the English Wikisource passed 100,000 text-units with of &quot;&quot;, a memoir by painter Francis Bicknell Carpenter.

In November, 2011, 250,000 text-units milestone was passed.

==Library contents==

Wikisource collects and stores in digital format previously published texts; including novels, non-fiction works, letters, speeches, constitutional and historical documents, laws and a range of other documents. All texts collected are either free of copyright or released under the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License. Texts in all languages are welcomed, as are translations. In addition to texts, Wikisource hosts material such as comics, films, recordings and spoken-word works. All texts held by Wikisource must have been previously published; the project does not host &quot;vanity press&quot; books or documents produced by its contributors.

A scanned source is preferred on many Wikisources and required on some. Most Wikisources will, however, accept works transcribed from offline sources or acquired from other digital libraries. The requirement for prior publication can also be waived in a small number of cases if the work is a source document of notable historical importance. The legal requirement for works to be licensed or free of copyright remains constant.

=== Annotations and translations – the difference to Wikibooks ===
The only original pieces accepted by Wikisource are annotations and translations. Wikisource, and its sister project Wikibooks, has the capacity for annotated editions of texts. On Wikisource, the annotations are supplementary to the original text, which remains the primary objective of the project. By contrast, on Wikibooks the annotations are primary, with the original text as only a reference or supplement, if present at all. Annotated editions are more popular on the German Wikisource. The project also accommodates translations of texts provided by its users. A significant translation on the English Wikisource is the project, intended to create a new, &quot;laissez-faire translation&quot; of The Bible.

==Structure==
===Language subdomains===
A separate Hebrew version of Wikisource (he.wikisource.org) was created in August 2004. The need for a language-specific Hebrew website derived from the difficulty of typing and editing Hebrew texts in a left-to-right environment (Hebrew is written right-to-left). In the ensuing months, contributors in other languages including German requested their own wikis, but a December vote on the creation of separate language domains was inconclusive. Finally, a second vote that ended May 12, 2005, supported the adoption of separate language subdomains at Wikisource by a large margin, allowing each language to host its texts on its own wiki.

An initial wave of 14 languages was set up on August 23, 2005. The new languages did not include English, but the code en: was temporarily set to redirect to the main website (). At this point the Wikisource community, through a mass project of manually sorting thousands of pages and categories by language, prepared for a second wave of page imports to local wikis. On September 11, 2005, the wikisource.org wiki was reconfigured to enable the English version, along with 8 other languages that were created early that morning and late the night before. Three more languages were created on March 29, 2006, and then another large wave of 14 language domains was created on June 2, 2006.

Languages without subdomains are locally incubated. , 182 languages are hosted locally.

As of 2025, there are Wikisource subdomains for languages of which are active and are closed. The active sites have articles and the closed sites have articles. There are registered users of which are recently active.

The top ten Wikisource language projects by mainspace article count:

For a complete list with totals see Wikimedia Statistics:

===wikisource.org===
During the move to language subdomains, the community requested that the main website remain a functioning wiki, in order to serve three purposes:

# &quot;To be a multilingual coordination site for the entire Wikisource project in all languages.&quot; In practice, use of the website for multilingual coordination has not been heavy since the conversion to language domains. Nevertheless, there is some policy activity at the Scriptorium, and multilingual updates for news and language milestones at pages such as Wikisource:2007.
# &quot;To be a home for texts in languages without their own subdomains, each with its own local main page for self-organization.&quot; As a language incubator, the wiki currently provides a home for over 30 languages that do not yet have their own language subdomains. Some of these are very active, and have built libraries with hundreds of texts (such as Volapük).
# &quot;To provide direct, ongoing support by a local wiki community for a dynamic multilingual portal at its Main Page, for users who go to http://wikisource.org.&quot; The current Main Page portal was created on August 26, 2005, by ThomasV, who based it upon the Wikipedia portal.

The idea of a project-specific coordination wiki, first realized at Wikisource, also took hold in another Wikimedia project, namely at Wikiversity&#x27;s Beta Wiki. Like wikisource.org, it serves Wikiversity coordination in all languages, and as a language incubator, but unlike Wikisource, its Main Page does not serve as its multilingual portal.

==Reception==
Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger criticised Wikisource and sister project Wiktionary in 2011, after he left the project, saying that their collaborative nature and technology means that there is no oversight by experts, and alleging that their content is therefore not reliable.

Bart D. Ehrman, a New Testament scholar and professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has criticised the English Wikisource&#x27;s project to create a user-generated translation of the Bible saying &quot;Democratization isn&#x27;t necessarily good for scholarship.&quot; Richard Elliott Friedman, an Old Testament scholar and professor of Jewish studies at the University of Georgia, identified errors in the translation of the Book of Genesis as of 2008.

In 2010, Wikimedia France signed an agreement with the (National Library of France) to add scans from its own &quot;Gallica&quot; digital library to French Wikisource. Fourteen hundred public domain French texts were added to the Wikisource library as a result via upload to the . The quality of the transcriptions, previously automatically generated by optical character recognition (OCR), was expected to be improved by Wikisource&#x27;s human proofreaders.

In 2011, the English Wikisource received many high-quality scans of documents from the US National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) as part of their efforts &quot;to increase the accessibility and visibility of its holdings.&quot; Processing and upload to Commons of these documents, along with many images from the NARA collection, was facilitated by a NARA Wikimedian in residence, Dominic McDevitt-Parks. Many of these documents have been transcribed and proofread by the Wikisource community and are featured as links in the National Archives&#x27; own online catalog.

<text>Alexander Berkman (November 21, 1870June 28, 1936) was a Russian-American anarchist and author. He was a leading member of the anarchist movement in the early 20th century, famous for both his political activism and his writing.

Berkman was born into a wealthy Jewish family in Vilna in the Russian Empire (present-day Vilnius, Lithuania) and emigrated to the United States in 1888. He lived in New York City, where he became involved in the anarchist movement. He was the one-time lover and lifelong friend of anarchist Emma Goldman. In 1892, undertaking an act of propaganda of the deed, Berkman made a failed attempt to assassinate businessman Henry Clay Frick during the Homestead strike, for which he served 14 years in prison. His experience in prison was the basis of his first book, &quot;Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist&quot;.

After his release from prison, Berkman served as editor of Goldman&#x27;s anarchist journal, &quot;Mother Earth&quot;, and later established his own journal, &quot;The Blast&quot;. In 1917, Berkman and Goldman were sentenced to two years in jail for conspiracy against the newly instated draft. After their release from prison, they were arrested—along with hundreds of others—and deported to Russia. Initially supportive of that country&#x27;s Bolshevik revolution, Berkman and Goldman soon became disillusioned, voicing their opposition to the Soviets&#x27; use of terror after seizing power and their repression of fellow revolutionaries. They left the Soviet Union in late 1921, and in 1925 Berkman published a book about his experiences, &quot;The Bolshevik Myth&quot;.

While living in France, Berkman continued his work in support of the anarchist movement, producing the classic exposition of anarchist principles &quot;Now and After: The ABC of Communist Anarchism&quot;. Suffering from ill health, Berkman took his own life in 1936.

==Life==

===Early years===
Berkman was born Ovsei Osipovich Berkman in the Lithuanian city of Vilnius (then called Vilna, and part of the Vilna Governorate in the Russian Empire). He was the youngest of four children born into a well-off Lithuanian Jewish family. Berkman&#x27;s father, Osip Berkman, was a successful leather merchant, and his mother, Yetta Berkman (née Natanson), came from a prosperous family.

In 1877, Osip Berkman was granted the right, as a successful businessman, to move from the Pale of Settlement to which Jews were generally restricted in the Russian Empire. The family moved to Saint Petersburg, a city previously off-limits to Jews. There, Ovsei adopted the more Russian name Alexander; he was known among family and friends as Sasha, a diminutive for Alexander. The Berkmans lived comfortably, with servants and a summer house. Berkman attended the &quot;gymnasium&quot;, where he received a classical education with the youth of Saint Petersburg&#x27;s elite.

As a youth, Berkman was influenced by the growing radicalism that was spreading among workers in the Russian capital. A wave of political assassinations culminated in a bomb blast that killed Tsar Alexander II in 1881. While his parents worried—correctly, as it turned out—that the tsar&#x27;s death might result in repression of the Jews and other minorities, Berkman became intrigued by the radical ideas of the day, including populism and nihilism. He became very upset when his favorite uncle, his mother&#x27;s brother Mark Natanson, was sentenced to death for revolutionary activities.

Soon after Berkman turned 12, his father died. The business had to be sold, and the family lost the right to live in Saint Petersburg. Yetta moved the family to Kovno, where her brother Nathan lived. Berkman had shown great promise as a student at the &quot;gymnasium&quot;, but his studies began to falter as he spent his time reading novels. One of the books that interested him was Ivan Turgenev&#x27;s novel &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; (1862), with its discussion of nihilist philosophy. But what truly moved him was Nikolay Chernyshevsky&#x27;s influential 1863 novel, &quot;What Is to Be Done?&quot;, and Berkman felt inspired by Rakhmetov, its puritanical protagonist who is willing to sacrifice personal pleasure and family ties in single-minded pursuit of his revolutionary aims.

Soon, Berkman joined a group at school that was reading and discussing revolutionary literature, which was prohibited under the new tsar, Alexander III. He distributed banned material to other students and wrote some radical tracts of his own, which he printed using supplies pilfered from the school. He turned in a paper titled &quot;There Is No God&quot;, which resulted in a one-year demotion as punishment on the basis of &quot;precocious godlessness, dangerous tendencies and subordination&quot;.

Berkman&#x27;s mother died in 1887, and his uncle Nathan Natanson became responsible for him. Berkman had contempt for Natanson for his desire to maintain order and avoid conflict. Natanson could not understand what Berkman found appealing in his radical ideas, and he worried that Berkman would bring shame to the family. Late that year, Berkman was caught stealing copies of the school exams and bribing a handyman. He was expelled and labelled a &quot;nihilist conspirator&quot;.

Berkman decided to emigrate to the United States. When his brother left for Germany in early 1888 to study medicine, Berkman took the opportunity to accompany him and from there made his way to New York City.

===New York City===

Soon after his arrival in New York, where he knew no one and spoke no English, Berkman became an anarchist through his involvement with groups that had formed to campaign to free the men convicted of the 1886 Haymarket bombing. He joined the Pioneers of Liberty, the first Jewish anarchist group in the U.S. The group was affiliated with the International Working People&#x27;s Association, the organization to which the Haymarket defendants had belonged, and they regarded the Haymarket men as martyrs. Since most of its members worked in the garment industry, the Pioneers of Liberty took part in strikes against sweatshops and helped establish some of the first Jewish labor unions in the city. Before long, Berkman was one of the prominent members of the organization.

Although he wasn&#x27;t fluent in English, Berkman did speak German; he soon came under the influence of Johann Most, the best known anarchist in the United States and an advocate of propaganda of the deed—&quot;attentat&quot;, or violence carried out to encourage the masses to revolt. He became a typesetter for Most&#x27;s German-language newspaper &quot;Freiheit&quot;.

In 1889, Berkman met and began a romance with Emma Goldman, another Russian immigrant. He invited her to Most&#x27;s lecture. Soon Berkman and Goldman fell in love and became inseparable. Despite their disagreements and separations, Goldman and Berkman would share a mutual devotion for decades, united by their anarchist principles and love for each other.

By the end of the year, they moved into a communal apartment with Berkman&#x27;s cousin, Modest Aronstam (referred to as &quot;Fedya&quot; in both Berkman&#x27;s &quot;Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist&quot; and Goldman&#x27;s &quot;Living My Life&quot;), and Goldman&#x27;s friend, Helene Minkin, along principles inspired by &quot;What Is to Be Done?&quot; Living according to the example of Rakhmetov, Berkman denied himself even the smallest pleasures, and expected his comrades to do the same. Aronstam, in contrast, occasionally brought home flowers. Frictions between the two grew: &quot;Every penny spent for ourselves was so much taken from the Cause,&quot; Berkman fumed. &quot;Luxury is a crime, a weakness.&quot; With time, however, the two cousins reconciled.

Berkman eventually broke with Most and aligned himself with the autonomists. The autonomists, an anarchist group associated with Josef Peukert, emphasized individual freedom. They feared the domination of the anarchist movement by a single individual and opposed the establishment of anarchist organizations. Consequently, the autonomists were opposed to Most. Soon, Berkman was working for the autonomists&#x27; publications, &#x27; and &#x27;, but he remained committed to the concept of violent action as a tool for inspiring revolutionary change.

At the end of 1891, Berkman learned that Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin, whom he admired, had canceled an American speaking tour on the basis that it was too expensive for the struggling anarchist movement. While Berkman was disappointed, the frugality of the action further elevated Kropotkin&#x27;s stature in his eyes.

===&quot;Attentat&quot;: Frick assassination attempt===

In 1892, Berkman, Goldman, and Aronstam relocated to Worcester, Massachusetts, where they operated a successful luncheonette. At the end of June, Goldman saw a newspaper headline that brought to her attention the trio&#x27;s first opportunity for political action: the Homestead Strike. In June 1892, workers at a steel plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania were locked out when negotiations between the Carnegie Steel Company and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers failed. Henry Clay Frick, the factory&#x27;s notoriously anti-union manager, hired 300 armed guards from the Pinkerton Detective Agency to break the union&#x27;s picket lines. When the Pinkerton guards arrived at the factory on the morning of July 6, a gunfight broke out. Nine union workers and seven guards were killed in the 12-hour fight.

Newspapers across the country defended the union workers, and the trio decided to assassinate Frick. They believed the assassination would arouse the working class to unite and revolt against the capitalist system. Berkman&#x27;s plan was to assassinate Frick and then kill himself; Goldman was to explain Berkman&#x27;s motives after his death; and Aronstam was to follow Berkman in the event that he failed in his mission. Emulating his Russian idols, Berkman tried to make a bomb, but when that failed, he went to Pittsburgh with the plan to use a handgun.

Arriving in Pittsburgh on July 14, Berkman sought out anarchists Henry Bauer and Carl Nold. They were followers of Most, but supported the Homestead strike. Berkman had never met either man but counted on their support. Nold invited Berkman to stay with him, and he and Bauer introduced Berkman to several local anarchists.

Berkman was ready to carry out the assassination on July 21. He wore a new suit and a black derby hat, and in his pockets he had a gun and a dagger fashioned from a steel file. He went to Frick&#x27;s office and asked to see him, saying he was the representative of a New York hiring agency, but he was told Frick was too busy to meet him. The following night, Berkman checked into a hotel under the name Rakhmetov, his role model from &quot;What Is to Be Done?&quot; On July 23, he returned to Frick&#x27;s office. While the attendant told Frick that the New York employment agent had returned to see him, Berkman burst into the office and took aim at Frick&#x27;s head. After two shots, Berkman was tackled to the ground. Still, he managed to pull out the dagger and stab Frick three times.

A carpenter who was working nearby heard the commotion and hit Berkman in the head with his hammer, but the blow only stunned him. The gunshots and struggle could be heard and seen from the street, and within minutes Frick&#x27;s office had attracted all sorts of people, but Berkman continued to resist. A deputy sheriff aimed his gun at Berkman, but Frick said, &quot;Don&#x27;t shoot. Leave him to the law.&quot; As the police led Berkman to the jail, an angry crowd gathered and shouted at Berkman. When he was questioned by police, Berkman said he had arrived in Pittsburgh on July 21 and that he had acted alone. A dynamite capsule was discovered in his mouth after a policeman noticed that he was chewing on something.
On July 24, a police officer took Berkman for a portrait. He lent Berkman his own tie for the picture. The following day, Aronstam arrived in Pittsburgh with pockets full of dynamite to finish Berkman&#x27;s botched assassination attempt. Somehow rumors of his arrival had preceded him, and he saw a newspaper headline that read &quot;Was Not Alone. Berkmann Had Accomplices in His Mission of Murder. Is Aaron Stamm Here?&quot; Aronstam became frightened, hid the dynamite in an outhouse, and returned to New York.

Most of the anarchists in Pittsburgh were questioned by police. Bauer and Nold were arrested and charged with complicity in Berkman&#x27;s plot. Everywhere, anarchists took sides for or against Berkman and his &quot;attentat&quot;. The autonomists supported him, as did many anarchists across the country. Peukert spoke out in his defense. Also defending Berkman was Dyer Lum, an anarchist who had been a comrade of the Haymarket defendants, and Lucy Parsons. Among those who criticized Berkman were Jo Labadie, Benjamin Tucker, and many other anarchists who believed the anarchist struggle should be peaceful. Berkman&#x27;s most prominent critic was Most, who belittled Berkman as a nuisance or a flunky hired by Frick himself to garner sympathy. Most published an article in his newspaper titled &quot;Reflections on &quot;Attentats&quot;&quot; in which he wrote that propaganda of the deed was doomed to be misunderstood in the U.S. and that it could only backfire. Most wrote that Berkman&#x27;s action had proven this; while Berkman might have demonstrated a certain heroism, in all other respects his attempt was a &quot;total failure&quot;.

Berkman was deeply interested in the debate concerning his action. He was almost heartbroken by the rebuke from Most, who had &quot;preached propaganda by deed all his life—now he repudiates the first &quot;attentat&quot; in this country&quot;. He was encouraged by the words of Kropotkin, who wrote that &quot;Berkman has done more to spread the anarchist idea among the masses who do not read our papers than all the writings that we may publish. He has shown that there are among the anarchists, men capable of being revolted by the crimes of capitalism to the point of giving their life to put an end to these crimes, or at least to open a way to such an end.&quot;

===Trial===
Berkman declined the services of a lawyer for his trial. The warden cautioned him against this choice, but Berkman replied &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in your laws. I don&#x27;t acknowledge the authority of your courts. I am innocent morally&quot;. Bauer and Nold visited him with their lawyers, who offered to represent him at no charge, but Berkman politely refused. As the trial approached, Berkman drafted a speech that he would read in court. Written in German because his English was still poor, it was 40 pages long and took two hours to read. Berkman tried to learn the date of his trial, but it was kept secret by the district attorney out of fear of an attack by Berkman&#x27;s comrades. Berkman therefore was unaware of his trial until the morning it began.

When Berkman was brought to the courtroom on September 19, the jury had already been empaneled. The district attorney had selected the jury without allowing Berkman to examine prospective jurors, and the judge had no objection to the unusual procedure. Berkman was charged with six counts: felonious assault with the intent to kill Frick; felonious assault with the intent to kill Lawrence Leishman, who had been in Frick&#x27;s office at the time of the attack; feloniously entering the offices of the Carnegie Steel Company on three occasions; and unlawfully carrying concealed weapons. Berkman pleaded not guilty to all charges.

Frick told the jury about the attempt on his life. The clothes he wore that day, bloody and riddled with holes, were shown to the jury. A physician testified that both of Berkman&#x27;s weapons, the gun and the dagger, could have caused death. Leishman testified that Berkman fired his pistol at him once and Berkman asked, &quot;Well, did I intend to kill you?&quot; &quot;I think so&quot;, Leishman replied, to which Berkman said, &quot;Well that&#x27;s not true. I didn&#x27;t intend to do it.&quot; Several witnesses told the jury that Berkman had visited the Carnegie offices three times. Berkman&#x27;s dagger and gun were placed into evidence, and the prosecution rested.

Berkman was asked to call his witnesses, but he had none. Instead, he asked to read his statement to the jury. A German translator was brought to the court. As an atheist, Berkman refused to be sworn in. He began reading his prepared statement. When the translator began to speak on his behalf to the jury, Berkman discovered the man was incompetent. He felt the man&#x27;s voice was &quot;cracked and shrill&quot; as he spoke to the jury in broken English himself. The effect of the statement, Berkman thought, was being lost. After about an hour, the judge told Berkman it was time to finish his oration.

Without leaving the jury box, the jurors found Berkman guilty on all charges. The judge gave Berkman the maximum sentence for each count: a total of 21 years in prison and one year in the workhouse, to be served consecutively. Berkman argued that he should be sentenced only for the attempt on Frick&#x27;s life and that the other charges were elements of the main crime of assault with the intent to kill, but the judge overruled his objection. In four hours, Berkman had been tried, convicted, and sentenced. He was brought to serve his sentence at Pennsylvania&#x27;s Western Penitentiary.

===Prison===
Within weeks of his arrival at prison, Berkman began planning his suicide. He tried to sharpen a spoon into a blade, but his attempt was discovered by a guard and Berkman spent the night in the dungeon. He thought about beating his head against the bars of his cell, but worried that his efforts might injure him but leave him alive. Berkman wrote a letter to Goldman, asking her to secure a dynamite capsule for him. A letter was smuggled out of the prison and arrangements were made for her to visit Berkman in November 1892, posing as his sister. Berkman knew as soon as he saw Goldman that she had not brought the dynamite capsule.

Between 1893 and 1897, the years when Bauer and Nold were also in the Western Penitentiary for their part in the assassination attempt, the three men surreptitiously produced 60 issues of a hand-written anarchist newsletter by transferring their work from cell to cell. They managed to send the completed newsletters, which they called &quot;Prison Blossoms&quot;, to friends outside the prison. Participating in &quot;Prison Blossoms&quot;, initially written in German and later in English, helped Berkman improve his English. He developed a friendship with the prison chaplain, John Lynn Milligan, who was a strong advocate on behalf of the prison library. Milligan encouraged Berkman to read books from the library, a process that furthered his knowledge of English.

Berkman frequently clashed with the prison&#x27;s management over the mistreatment of his fellow prisoners. Sometimes he was put into solitary confinement, with one stay lasting 16 months. When Berkman smuggled reports of corruption and brutality outside the prison, resulting in an investigation, he was taken to the dungeon and put in a straitjacket.

Letters from friends were like lifelines to Berkman. &quot;The very arrival of a letter is momentous,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It brings a glow into the prisoner&#x27;s heart to feel that he is remembered.&quot; Goldman and anarchist Voltairine de Cleyre were regular correspondents, and other friends wrote frequently.

In 1897, as Berkman finished the fifth year of his sentence, he applied to the Pennsylvania Board of Pardons. Having served as his own attorney, Berkman had failed to object to the trial judge&#x27;s rulings and thus had no legal basis for an appeal; a pardon was his only hope for early release. The Board of Pardons denied his application in October 1897. A second application was rejected in early 1899.

Now an escape seemed like Berkman&#x27;s only option. The plan was to rent a house across the street from the prison and dig a tunnel from the house to the prison. Berkman had been given access to a large portion of the prison and had grown familiar with its layout. In April 1900, a house was leased. The tunnel would be dug from the cellar of the house to the stable inside the prison yard. When the digging was complete, Berkman would sneak into the stable, tear open the wooden flooring, and crawl through the tunnel to the house.

Digging the tunnel turned out to be more difficult than expected. The soil was rocky, which forced the men to dig deeper than planned. There, they discovered a leaking gas main, which required the installation of special pumps to bring fresh air to the men. To hide the noise from the digging, one of the crew played piano and sang in the house while the others worked below. On July 5, Berkman visited the prison stable, planning to make his escape. He was horrified to discover that the entrance was blocked by a large load of stones and bricks recently dumped for a construction project.

Three weeks later, some children playing in the street wandered into the yard of the now-vacant house. One of them fell into the cellar and discovered the tunnel. While the prison&#x27;s Board of Inspectors was unable to identify the inmate involved in the escape attempt, the warden punished Berkman by sending him to solitary confinement for nearly a year. Days after he was released from solitary, Berkman tried to hang himself with a strip of his blanket.

Soon things began looking up for Berkman. He received word that his sentence had been reduced by two-and-a-half years, thanks to a new law. He also received his first visitor in nine years. A month later, Goldman was able to visit under an assumed name. The warden retired and his successor improved the prison for all prisoners.

Early in his incarceration, Berkman questioned whether two men could love one another. He was aware, as he later wrote, that incidents of rape or attempted rape took place &quot;almost every week, yet no one has ever been taken to court ... on such charges&quot;. Some of Berkman&#x27;s own friendships within the prison became physical. He became intimate with one prisoner, &quot;Johnny&quot;, when the two were confined to the dungeon. He discussed homosexuality with another prisoner, &quot;George&quot;, a formerly married physician who told Berkman about his own homosexual prison affair.

In 1905, Berkman was transported from the Western Penitentiary to the Allegheny County Workhouse, where he spent the final 10 months of his sentence. He found conditions in the workhouse &quot;a nightmare of cruelty, infinitely worse than the most inhuman aspects of the penitentiary.&quot; The guards beat inmates at the slightest provocation, and one particularly sadistic guard shoved prisoners down the stairs. Berkman felt mixed emotions; while he was excited about the prospect of freedom, he was concerned about the friends he had made in the prison, and he was worried about what his life as a free man would be like.

===Release===
Berkman was released from the workhouse on May 18, 1906, after serving 14 years of his sentence. He was met at the workhouse gates by newspaper reporters and police, who recommended that he leave the area. He took the train to Detroit, where Goldman met him. She found herself &quot;seized by terror and pity&quot; at his gaunt appearance. Later, at a friend&#x27;s house, Berkman felt overwhelmed by the presence of well-wishers. He became claustrophobic and almost suicidal. Nevertheless, he agreed to a joint lecture tour with Goldman.

Back in New York after the tour, Berkman and Goldman tried to rekindle their romantic relationship, but had lost passion for each other. Instead, Berkman was attracted to some of the younger women in the movement, including a teenager named Becky Edelsohn.

Berkman continued to suffer from depression and increasingly spoke about committing suicide. He began a new lecture tour, but when he failed to appear in Cleveland, concerned friends sent a telegram to Goldman in New York. She worried that he had killed himself. Anarchists across the country searched for Berkman in police stations, hospitals, and morgues. Even newspapers wondered where he was, speculating that he had been kidnapped by Pittsburgh detectives, by Secret Service agents, or by &quot;agents of millionaires&quot; who opposed his message. Three days later, Berkman appeared in New York and contacted Goldman. He said the lecture tour had made him feel miserable. He had purchased a handgun in Cleveland with the intention of killing himself in a city where nobody knew him, but he was unable to complete the act.
After resting for several months, Berkman began to recover. He remained anxious about his lack of employment. He considered returning to his old job as a printer, but his skills had become obsolete in light of innovations in linotype machines. With Goldman&#x27;s encouragement, Berkman began to write an account of his prison years, &quot;Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist&quot;, and she invited him to become the editor of her journal, &quot;Mother Earth&quot;. He served as editor from 1907 to 1915 and took the journal in a more provocative and practical direction, in contrast to the more theoretical approach which had been favored by the previous editor, Max Baginski. Under Berkman&#x27;s stewardship, circulation of &quot;Mother Earth&quot; rose to as high as 10,000 and it became the leading anarchist publication in the U.S. at the time.

===Ferrer Center===
Berkman helped establish the Ferrer Center in New York during 1910 and 1911 and served as one of its teachers. The Ferrer Center, named in honor of Spanish anarchist Francisco Ferrer, included a free school that encouraged independent thinking among its students. The Ferrer Center also served as a community center for adults.

===The Ludlow massacre and the Lexington Avenue explosion===

In September 1913, the United Mine Workers called a strike against coal-mining companies in Ludlow, Colorado. The largest mining company was the Rockefeller family-owned Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Company. On April 20, 1914, the Colorado National Guard fought a tent colony of striking miners and, during the day-long fight, 26 people were killed.

During the strike, Berkman organized demonstrations in New York in support of the miners. In May and June, he and other anarchists led several protests against John D. Rockefeller Jr. The protests eventually moved from New York City to Rockefeller&#x27;s home in Tarrytown, New York, and resulted in beatings, arrests, and imprisonments of anarchists. The strong police response to the Tarrytown protests led to a bomb plot by several Ferrer Center anarchists.
In July, three associates of Berkman—Charles Berg, Arthur Caron, and Carl Hanson—began collecting dynamite and storing it at the apartment of another conspirator, Louise Berger. Some sources, including Charles Plunkett, one of the surviving conspirators, say that Berkman was the chief conspirator, the oldest and most experienced member of the group. Berkman denied any involvement or knowledge of the plan.

At 9 a.m. on July 4, Berger left her apartment for the &quot;Mother Earth&quot; offices. Fifteen minutes later a deadly explosion took place. The bomb had exploded prematurely, shaking the sixth story of Berger&#x27;s tenement building, wrecking the three upper floors and killing Berg, Caron, Hanson, and a woman, Marie Chavez, who apparently was not involved in the conspiracy. Berkman arranged the dead men&#x27;s funerals.

===&quot;The Blast&quot; and the Preparedness Day Bombing===
In late 1915, Berkman left New York and went to California. In San Francisco the following year, he started his own anarchist journal, &quot;The Blast&quot;. Although it was published for just 18 months, &quot;The Blast&quot; was considered second only to &quot;Mother Earth&quot; in its influence among U.S. anarchists.

On July 22, 1916, a bomb exploded during the San Francisco Preparedness Day Parade, killing ten people and wounding 40. Police suspected Berkman, although there was no evidence, and ultimately their investigation focused on two local labor activists, Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings. Although neither Mooney nor Billings were anarchists, Berkman came to their aid: raising a defense fund, hiring lawyers, and beginning a national campaign on their behalf. Mooney and Billings were convicted, with Mooney sentenced to death and Billings to life imprisonment.

Berkman arranged for Russian anarchists to protest outside the American embassy in Petrograd during the Russian Revolution, which led U.S. President Woodrow Wilson to ask California&#x27;s governor to commute Mooney&#x27;s death sentence. When the governor reluctantly did so, he said that &quot;the propaganda in [Mooney&#x27;s] behalf following the plan outlined by Berkman has been so effective as to become world-wide.&quot; Billings and Mooney both were pardoned in 1939.

===World War I===
In 1917 the U.S. entered World War I and Congress enacted the Selective Service Act, which required all men between the ages of 21 and 30 to register for military conscription. Berkman moved back to New York, where he and Goldman organized the No Conscription League of New York, which proclaimed: &quot;We oppose conscription because we are internationalists, anti-militarists, and opposed to all wars waged by capitalistic governments.&quot; The organization was at the forefront of anti-draft activism, and chapters were established in other cities. The No Conscription League changed its focus from public meetings to disseminating pamphlets after police started disrupting the group&#x27;s public events in search of young men who had not registered for the draft.

Berkman and Goldman were arrested during a raid of their offices on June 15, 1917, during which police seized what &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as &quot;a wagon load of anarchist records and propaganda material&quot;. The pair were charged under Espionage Act of 1917 with &quot;conspiracy to induce persons not to register&quot;, and were held on $25,000 bail each.
Berkman and Goldman defended themselves during their trial. Berkman invoked the First Amendment, asking how the government could claim to fight for &quot;liberty and democracy&quot; in Europe while suppressing free speech at home:

Will you proclaim to the world that you who carry liberty and democracy to Europe have no liberty here, that you who are fighting for democracy in Germany, suppress democracy right here in New York, in the United States? Are you going to suppress free speech and liberty in this country, and still pretend that you love liberty so much that you will fight for it five thousand miles away?

The jury found them guilty and Judge Julius M. Mayer imposed the maximum sentence: two years&#x27; imprisonment, a $10,000 fine, and the possibility of deportation after their release from prison. Berkman served his sentence in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, seven months of which he spent in solitary confinement for protesting the beating of other inmates. When he was released on October 1, 1919, Berkman looked &quot;haggard and pale&quot;; according to Goldman, the 21 months Berkman served in Atlanta took a greater toll on him than his 14-year incarceration in Pennsylvania.

===Russia===
Berkman and Goldman were released at the height of the first U.S. Red Scare; the Russian Revolutions of 1917, combined with anxiety about the war, produced a climate of anti-radical and anti-foreign sentiment. The U.S. Justice Department&#x27;s General Intelligence Division, headed by J. Edgar Hoover and under the direction of Attorney General Alexander Mitchell Palmer, initiated a series of raids to arrest leftists. While they were in prison, Hoover wrote: &quot;Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman are, beyond doubt, two of the most dangerous anarchists in this country and if permitted to return to the community will result in undue harm.&quot; Under the 1918 Anarchist Exclusion Act, the government deported Berkman, who had never applied for U.S. citizenship, along with Goldman and more than two hundred others, to Russia aboard the &quot;Buford&quot;.
At a farewell banquet in Chicago, Berkman and Goldman were told the news of the death of Henry Clay Frick, whom Berkman had tried to kill more than 25 years earlier. Asked for a comment by a reporter, Berkman said Frick had been &quot;deported by God&quot;.

Berkman&#x27;s initial reaction to the Bolshevik revolution was enthusiastic. When he first heard of their coup, he exclaimed &quot;this is the happiest moment of my life&quot;, and he wrote that the Bolsheviks were the &quot;expression of the most fundamental longing of the human soul&quot;. Arrival in Russia stirred great emotions in Berkman, and he described it as &quot;the most sublime day in my life&quot;, surpassing even his release after 14 years in prison.

Berkman and Goldman spent much of 1920 traveling through Russia collecting material for a proposed Museum of the Revolution. As the pair traveled around the country, they found repression, mismanagement, and corruption instead of the equality and worker empowerment they had dreamed of. Those who questioned the government were demonized as counter-revolutionaries, and workers still labored under severe conditions. They met with Lenin, who assured them that government suppression of press liberties was justified. &quot;When the Revolution is out of danger,&quot; he told them, &quot;then free speech might be indulged in&quot;.

Strikes broke out in Petrograd in March 1921 when workers demonstrated for better food rations and more autonomy for their unions. Berkman and Goldman supported the strikers, writing: &quot;To remain silent now is impossible, even criminal.&quot; The unrest spread to the port of Kronstadt, where Trotsky ordered a military response. In the battle that ensued, 600 sailors were killed; 2,000 more were arrested; and 500 to 1,500 Soviet troops died. In the wake of these events, Berkman and Goldman decided there was no future in the country for them. Berkman wrote in his diary:

Gray are the passing days. One by one the embers of hope have died out. Terror and despotism have crushed the life born in October. ... Dictatorship is trampling the masses under foot. The Revolution is dead; its spirit cries in the wilderness. ... I have decided to leave Russia.Berkman and Goldman left the country in December 1921. Berkman moved to Berlin and almost immediately began to write a series of pamphlets about the Russian Revolution. &quot;The Russian Tragedy&quot;, &quot;The Russian Revolution and the Communist Party&quot;, and &quot;The Kronstadt Rebellion&quot; were published during the summer of 1922.

Berkman planned to write a book about his experience in Russia, but he postponed it while he assisted Goldman as she wrote a similar book, using as sources material he had collected. Work on Goldman&#x27;s book, &quot;My Two Years in Russia&quot;, was completed in December 1922, and the book was published in two parts with titles not of her choosing: &quot;My Disillusionment in Russia&quot; (1923) and &quot;My Further Disillusionment in Russia&quot; (1924). Berkman worked on his book, &quot;The Bolshevik Myth&quot;, throughout 1923 and it was published in January 1925.

=== &quot;Now and After&quot; ===

Berkman moved to Saint-Cloud, France, in 1925. He organized a fund for aging anarchists including Sébastien Faure, Errico Malatesta, and Max Nettlau. He continued to fight on behalf of anarchist prisoners in the Soviet Union, and arranged the publication of &quot;Letters from Russian Prisons&quot;, which detailed their persecution.

In 1926, the Jewish Anarchist Federation of New York asked Berkman to write an introduction to anarchism intended for the general public. By presenting the principles of anarchism in plain language, the New York anarchists hoped that readers might be swayed to support the movement or, at a minimum, that the book might improve the image of anarchism and anarchists in the public&#x27;s eyes. Berkman produced &quot;Now and After: The ABC of Communist Anarchism&quot;, first published in 1929 and reprinted many times since (often under the title &quot;What Is Communist Anarchism?&quot; or &quot;What Is Anarchism?&quot;). Anarchist Stuart Christie wrote that &quot;Now and After&quot; is &quot;among the best introductions to the ideas of anarchism in the English language&quot; and historian Paul Avrich described it as &quot;the clearest exposition of communist anarchism in English or any other language&quot;.

===Final years and death===
Berkman spent his last years eking out a precarious living as an editor and translator. He and his companion, Emmy Eckstein, relocated frequently within Nice in search of smaller and less expensive quarters. Aronstam, who had changed his name to Modest Stein and attained success as an artist, became a benefactor, sending Berkman a monthly sum to help with expenses. In the 1930s his health began to deteriorate, and he underwent two unsuccessful operations for a prostate condition in early 1936. After the second surgery, he was bed-ridden for months. In constant pain, forced to rely on the financial help of friends and dependent on Eckstein&#x27;s care, Berkman decided to commit suicide. In the early hours of June 28, 1936, unable to endure the physical pain of his ailment, Berkman tried to shoot himself in the heart with a handgun, but he failed to make a clean job of it. The bullet punctured a lung and his stomach and lodged in his spinal column, paralyzing him. Goldman rushed to Nice to be at his side. Berkman recognized her but was unable to speak. He sank into a coma in the afternoon, and died at 10 o&#x27;clock that night.

Goldman made funeral arrangements for Berkman. It had been his desire to be cremated and have his ashes buried in Waldheim Cemetery in Chicago, near the graves of the Haymarket defendants who had inspired him, but she could not afford the expense. Instead, Berkman was buried in a common grave in Cochez Cemetery in Nice.

Berkman died weeks before the start of the Spanish Revolution, modern history&#x27;s clearest example of an anarcho-syndicalist revolution. In July 1937, Goldman wrote that seeing his principles in practice in Spain &quot;would have rejuvenated [Berkman] and given him new strength, new hope. If only he had lived a little longer!&quot;

<text>Nick Holonyak Jr. ( ; November 3, 1928September 18, 2022) was an American engineer and educator. He is noted particularly for his 1962 invention and first demonstration of a semiconductor laser diode that emitted visible light. This device was the forerunner of the first generation of commercial light-emitting diodes (LEDs). He was then working at a General Electric research laboratory near Syracuse, New York. He left General Electric in 1963 and returned to his alma mater, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he later became John Bardeen Endowed Chair in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Physics.

==Early life and career==
Nick Holonyak Jr. was born in Zeigler, Illinois, on November 3, 1928. His parents were Rusyn immigrants. His father worked in a coal mine. Holonyak was the first member of his family to receive any type of formal schooling. He once worked 30 straight hours on the Illinois Central Railroad before realizing that a life of hard labor was not what he wanted and he would prefer to go to school instead. According to a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; article in 2003, &quot;The cheap and reliable semiconductor lasers critical to DVD players, bar code readers and scores of other devices owe their existence in some small way to the demanding workload thrust upon Downstate railroad crews decades ago.&quot;

Holonyak earned his bachelor&#x27;s (1950), master&#x27;s (1951), and doctoral (1954) degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Holonyak was John Bardeen&#x27;s first doctoral student there. In 1954, Holonyak went to Bell Telephone Laboratories, where he worked on silicon-based electronic devices. From 1955 to 1957 he served with the U.S. Army Signal Corps.

From 1957 to 1963 he was a scientist at the General Electric Company&#x27;s Advanced Semiconductor Laboratory near Syracuse, New York. Here he invented, fabricated, and demonstrated the first visible light laser diode on October 9, 1962. He grew crystals of the alloy GaAs0.60P0.40; a GaAs laser diode that worked in the infrared had recently been demonstrated by his General Electric colleague Robert N. Hall. The GaAs0.60P0.40 laser diode worked at low temperatures, but the device still functioned as a light-emitting diode at room temperature. The demonstration of red light emission from the diode inspired the article &quot;Light of Hope – or Terror&quot; in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. GaAsP was the material used for the first generation of commercial LEDs that came to market a few years later.

==University of Illinois==
In 1963, Holonyak became a professor at the University of Illinois. In 1993, he was named the John Bardeen Endowed Chair Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He investigated methods for manufacturing quantum dot lasers. He and Dr. Milton Feng ran a transistor laser research center at the university funded by $6.5 million from the United States Department of Defense through DARPA. Holonyak retired in 2013.

Ten of his 60 former doctoral students have developed new uses for LED technology at Philips Lumileds Lighting Company in Silicon Valley.

==Inventions==

In addition to introducing the III-V alloy LED, Holonyak held 41 patents. His other inventions include the red-light semiconductor laser, usually called the laser diode (used in CD and DVD players and cell phones) and the shorted emitter p-n-p-n switch (used in light dimmers and power tools).

In 2006, the American Institute of Physics decided on the five most important papers in each of its journals since it was founded 75 years ago. Two of these five papers, in the journal &quot;Applied Physics Letters&quot;, were co-authored by Holonyak. The first one, co-authored with S. F. Bevacqua in 1962, announced the creation of the first visible-light laser diode. The second, co-authored primarily with Milton Feng in 2005, announced the creation of a transistor laser that can operate at room temperatures. Holonyak predicted that his LEDs would replace the incandescent light bulb of Thomas Edison in the February 1963 issue of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, and as LEDs improve in quality and efficiency they are gradually replacing incandescents as the bulb of choice.

==Awards and honors==
Holonyak was presented awards by George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, Emperor Akihito of Japan, and Vladimir Putin. He also received the Global Energy International Prize, the National Medal of Technology, the Order of Lincoln Medallion, and the 2004 Lemelson–MIT Prize, also worth $500,000. Many colleagues expressed their belief that he deserved the Nobel Prize for his invention of the GaAsP laser and LED. On this subject, Holonyak said, &quot;It&#x27;s ridiculous to think that somebody owes you something. We&#x27;re lucky to be alive, when it comes down to it.&quot; In October 2014, Holonyak reversed his stance by stating &quot;I find this one insulting&quot; in reaction to news that the inventors of the blue LED were awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics, instead of his fellow LED researchers.
