<text>Bonaventura Francesco Cavalieri (; 1598 – 30 November 1647) was an Italian mathematician and a Jesuate. He is known for his work on the problems of optics and motion, work on indivisibles, the precursors of infinitesimal calculus, and the introduction of logarithms to Italy. Cavalieri&#x27;s principle in geometry partially anticipated integral calculus.

== Life ==
Born in Milan, Cavalieri joined the Jesuates order (not to be confused with the Jesuits) at the age of fifteen, taking the name Bonaventura upon becoming a novice of the order, and remained a member until his death. He took his vows as a full member of the order in 1615, at the age of seventeen, and shortly after joined the Jesuat house in Pisa. By 1616 he was a student of geometry at the University of Pisa. There he came under the tutelage of Benedetto Castelli, who probably introduced him to Galileo Galilei. In 1617 he briefly joined the Medici court in Florence, under the patronage of Cardinal Federico Borromeo, but the following year he returned to Pisa and began teaching Mathematics in place of Castelli. He applied for the Chair of Mathematics at the University of Bologna but was turned down.

In 1620, he returned to the Jesuate house in Milan, where he had lived as a novitiate, and became a deacon under Cardinal Borromeo. He studied theology in the monastery of San Gerolamo in Milan, and was named prior of the monastery of St. Peter in Lodi. In 1623 he was made prior of St. Benedict&#x27;s monastery in Parma, but was still applying for positions in mathematics. He applied again to Bologna and then, in 1626, to Sapienza University, but was declined each time, despite taking six months&#x27; leave of absence to support his case to Sapienza in Rome. In 1626 he began to suffer from gout, which would restrict his movements for the rest of his life. He was also turned down from a position at the University of Parma, which he believed was due to his membership of the Jesuate order, as Parma was administered by the Jesuit order at the time. In 1629 he was appointed Chair of Mathematics at the University of Bologna, which is attributed to Galileo&#x27;s support of him to the Bolognese senate.

He published most of his work while at Bologna, though some of it had been written previously; his &quot;Geometria Indivisibilibus&quot;, where he outlined what would later become the method of indivisibles, was written in 1627 while in Parma and presented as part of his application to Bologna, but was not published until 1635. Contemporary critical reception was mixed, and &quot;Exercitationes geometricae sex&quot; (Six Exercises in Geometry) was published in 1647, partly as a response to criticism. Also at Bologna, he published tables of logarithms and information on their use, promoting their use in Italy.

Galileo exerted a strong influence on Cavalieri, and Cavalieri would write at least 112 letters to Galileo. Galileo said of him, &quot;few, if any, since Archimedes, have delved as far and as deep into the science of geometry.&quot; He corresponded widely; his known correspondents include Marin Mersenne, Evangelista Torricelli and Vincenzo Viviani. Torricelli in particular was instrumental in refining and promoting the method of indivisibles. He also benefited from the patronage of Cesare Marsili.

Towards the end of his life, his health declined significantly. Arthritis prevented him from writing, and much of his correspondence was dictated and written by Stephano degli Angeli, a fellow Jesuate and student of Cavalieri. Angeli would go on to further develop Cavalieri&#x27;s method.

In 1647 he died, probably of gout.

== Science, Mathematics Work ==
From 1632 to 1646, Cavalieri published eleven books dealing with problems in astronomy, optics, motion and geometry.

=== Work in optics ===
Cavalieri&#x27;s first book, first published in 1632 and reprinted once in 1650, was , or &quot;The Burning Mirror, or a Treatise on Conic Sections&quot;. The aim of &quot;Lo Specchio Ustorio&quot; was to address the question of how Archimedes could have used mirrors to burn the Roman fleet as they approached Syracuse, a question still in debate. The book went beyond this purpose and also explored conic sections, reflections of light, and the properties of parabolas. In this book, he developed the theory of mirrors shaped into parabolas, hyperbolas, and ellipses, and various combinations of these mirrors. He demonstrated that if, as was later shown, light has a finite and determinate speed, there is minimal interference in the image at the focus of a parabolic, hyperbolic or elliptic mirror, though this was theoretical since the mirrors required could not be constructed using contemporary technology. This would produce better images than the telescopes that existed at the time.

He also demonstrated some properties of curves. The first is that, for a light ray parallel to the axis of a parabola and reflected so as to pass through the focus, the sum of the incident angle and its reflection is equal to that of any other similar ray. He then demonstrated similar results for hyperbolas and ellipses. The second result, useful in the design of reflecting telescopes, is that if a line is extended from a point outside of a parabola to the focus, then the reflection of this line on the outside surface of the parabola is parallel to the axis. Other results include the property that if a line passes through a hyperbola and its external focus, then its reflection on the interior of the hyperbola will pass through the internal focus; the reverse of the previous, that a ray directed through the parabola to the internal focus is reflected from the outer surface to the external focus; and the property that if a line passes through one internal focus of an ellipse, its reflection on the internal surface of the ellipse will pass through the other internal focus. While some of these properties had been noted previously, Cavalieri gave the first proof of many.

&quot;Lo Specchio Ustorio&quot; also included a table of reflecting surfaces and modes of reflection for practical use.

Cavalieri&#x27;s work also contained theoretical designs for a new type of telescope using mirrors, a reflecting telescope, initially developed to answer the question of Archimedes&#x27; Mirror and then applied on a much smaller scale as telescopes. He illustrated three different concepts for incorporating reflective mirrors within his telescope model. Plan one consisted of a large, concave mirror directed towards the sun as to reflect light into a second, smaller, convex mirror. Cavalieri&#x27;s second concept consisted of a main, truncated, paraboloid mirror and a second, convex mirror. His third option illustrated a strong resemblance to his previous concept, replacing the convex secondary lens with a concave lens.

=== Work in geometry and the method of indivisibles ===
Inspired by earlier work by Galileo, Cavalieri developed a new geometrical approach called the method of indivisibles to calculus and published a treatise on the topic, , or &quot;Geometry, developed by a new method through the indivisibles of the continua&quot;. This was written in 1627, but was not published until 1635. In this work, Cavalieri considers an entity referred to in the text as &#x27;all the lines&#x27; or &#x27;all the planes&#x27; of a figure, an indefinite number of parallel lines or planes within the bounds of a figure that are comparable to the area and volume, respectively, of the figure. Later mathematicians, improving on his method, would treat &#x27;all the lines&#x27; and &#x27;all the planes&#x27; as equivalent or equal to the area and volume, but Cavalieri, in an attempt to avoid the question of the composition of the continuum, insisted that the two were comparable but not equal.

These parallel elements are called indivisibles respectively of area and volume and provide the building blocks of Cavalieri&#x27;s method, and are also fundamental features of integral calculus. He also used the method of indivisibles to calculate the result which is now written formula_1, in the process of calculating the area enclosed in an Archimedean Spiral, which he later generalised to other figures, showing, for instance, that the volume of a cone is one-third of the volume of its circumscribed cylinder.

An immediate application of the method of indivisibles is Cavalieri&#x27;s principle, which states that the volumes of two objects are equal if the areas of their corresponding cross-sections are in all cases equal. Two cross-sections correspond if they are intersections of the body with planes equidistant from a chosen base plane. (The same principle had been previously used by Zu Gengzhi (480–525) of China, in the specific case of calculating the volume of the sphere.)

The method of indivisibles as set out by Cavalieri was powerful but was limited in its usefulness in two respects. First, while Cavalieri&#x27;s proofs were intuitive and later demonstrated to be correct, they were not rigorous; second, his writing was dense and opaque. While many contemporary mathematicians furthered the method of indivisibles, the critical reception was severe. Andre Taquet and Paul Guldin both published responses to the Guldin&#x27;s particularly in-depth critique suggested that Cavalieri&#x27;s method was derived from the work of Johannes Kepler and Bartolomeo Sovero, attacked his method for a lack of rigorousness, and then argues that there can be no meaningful ratio between two infinities, and therefore it is meaningless to compare one to another.

Cavalieri&#x27;s &quot;Exercitationes geometricae sex&quot; or &quot;Six Geometric Exercises&quot; (1647) was written in direct response to Guldin&#x27;s criticism. It was initially drafted as a dialogue in the manner of Galileo, but correspondents advised against the format as being unnecessarily inflammatory. The charges of plagiarism were without substance, but much of the &quot;Exercitationes&quot; dealt with the mathematical substance of Guldin&#x27;s arguments. He argued, disingenuously, that his work regarded &#x27;all the lines&#x27; as a separate entity from the area of a figure, and then argued that &#x27;all the lines&#x27; and &#x27;all the planes&#x27; dealt not with absolute but with relative infinity, and therefore could be compared. These arguments were not convincing to contemporaries. The &quot;Exercitationes&quot; nonetheless represented a significant improvement to the method of indivisibles. By applying transformations to his variables, he generalised his previous integral result, showing thatformula_2 for n=3 to n=9, which is now known as Cavalieri&#x27;s quadrature formula.

=== Work in astronomy ===
Towards the end of his life, Cavalieri published two books on astronomy. While they use the language of astrology, he states in the text that he did not believe in or practice astrology. Those books were the (1639) and the (1646).

=== Other work ===
He published tables of logarithms, emphasizing their practical use in the fields of astronomy and geography.

Cavalieri also constructed a hydraulic pump for a monastery that he managed. The Duke of Mantua obtained one similar.

==Legacy==

According to Gilles-Gaston Granger, Cavalieri belongs with Newton, Leibniz, Pascal, Wallis and MacLaurin as one of those who in the 17th and 18th centuries &quot;redefine[d] the mathematical object&quot;.

The lunar crater Cavalerius is named after Cavalieri.

<doc id="412567" wikidata="Q8059908" url="?curid=412567" title="Yu Di (Tang dynasty)">
<text>Yu Di (; died 818), courtesy name Yunyuan (允元), formally initially Duke Li of Yan () and later Duke Si of Yan (), was a Chinese diplomat, military general, politician, and warlord during the Tang dynasty. He was a powerful warlord at the end of the reign of Emperor Dezong but submitted to imperial authority during the reign of Emperor Dezong&#x27;s grandson Emperor Xianzong.

== Background and early career ==
It is not known when Yu Di was born, but it is known that his family was from Henan Municipality (, i.e., the region of the Tang dynasty eastern capital Luoyang). His family traced its ancestry to the prominent Xianbei clan Moniuyu () of Northern Wei, which changed its name to Yu when Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei had the Xianbei clans&#x27; names changed to Han names. Among Yu Di&#x27;s ancestors were generals and officials of Northern Wei, Western Wei, Northern Zhou, Sui dynasty, and Tang, including the prominent Northern Zhou general Yu Jin (). Yu Di&#x27;s grandfather Yu Wang (于汪) served as the director of the archival bureau, while his father Yu Xiong () served as a military advisor to a prefectural prefect.

It was said that because of his heritage, Yu Di was made an imperial guard officer at the start of his official career, and then as the sheriff of Huayin County (, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi). The surveyor of the circuit, Liu Wan (), later invited him to serve as assistant; yet later, while he was serving as the secretary general of Yueyang County (, in modern Xi&#x27;an, Shaanxi), he served under the senior official Zhang Yi at a treaty signing with the Tibetan Empire. Thereafter, he served as &quot;Simen Yuanwailang&quot; (), a low-level official at the ministry of justice (, &quot;Xingbu&quot;), as well as &quot;Shiyushi&quot; (), a low-level imperial censor. He later again served on a diplomatic mission with the Tibetan Empire, and was said to have served well and been highly regarded as a result. He later served as the magistrate of Chang&#x27;an County (one of the two counties making up the Tang capital Chang&#x27;an) and then as &quot;Jiabu Langzhong&quot; (), a supervisorial official at the ministry of rites (, &quot;Libu&quot;).

Later, he was sent out of Chang&#x27;an to serve as the prefect of Hu Prefecture (, in modern Huzhou, Zhejiang). Within his territory was a lake that, during the time of the Southern dynasties, provided irrigation water for a large area, but which since then had become abandoned. Yu ordered that its reconstruction be carried out, and thereafter, the people received not only the benefits of irrigation but also of fishing. As the prefecture did not have much usable land, many human corpses went unburied, and Yu established more than 10 burial sites for the bodies. He later served as the prefect of Su Prefecture (, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu), and it was said that the irrigation ditches and the streets that he constructed were still heavily relied upon at the time that the &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; was written—i.e., during Later Jin. Believing that there were too many odd temples in his territory, he had them destroyed, leaving only the temples of Taibo of Wu and Wu Zixu. However, while Yu was said to be able as a prefect, he was also said to be cruel and unreasonable at times, often caning people, particularly when he was at Hu Prefecture. His superior, the circuit governor (, &quot;Guanchashi&quot;) Wang Wei () reported this to then-reigning Emperor Dezong, but Emperor Dezong took no actions against Yu. (After Yu was later promoted several times, he wrote a letter to Wang to brag, &quot;After I received your poor comments, I was promoted three times.&quot;) Yu was later promoted to be &quot;Dali Qing&quot; (), the chief judge of the superior court, and yet later served as the governor of Shan&#x27;guo Circuit (, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan). As he believed that he was becoming powerful, he was further abusing his power and being cruel, punishing many of his subordinates daily with heavy punishments. On one occasion, a secretary, Yao Xian (), becoming distressed over Yu&#x27;s cruelty, jumped into a river (probably Yellow River) to his death while rowing on the river with his brother.

== As &quot;Jiedushi&quot; of Shannan East Circuit ==
In 798, Yu Di was made the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei) and the prefect of its capital Xiang Prefecture (). Shortly thereafter, Wu Shaocheng the military governor of Zhangyi Circuit (, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan), whose circuit bordered Yu&#x27;s, rebelled against Emperor Dezong&#x27;s authority, and Yu was one of the generals commissioned to attack Wu. In 799, Yu captured two counties from Wu—Wufang () and Langshan () (both in modern Zhumadian).

Thereafter, however, Yu grew arrogant, and it was said that he recruited more soldiers and acted as if the land south of the Han River was all his domain. It was also said that he killed people at will. As Emperor Dezong was more interested in appeasing the regional governors at the time, he acted as Yu requested, including promoting Xiang Prefecture&#x27;s status into one where a commandant would be stationed, just as the capital of two other circuits ruled by warlords ruling their realms independently from the imperial government—Yun Prefecture (, in modern Tai&#x27;an, Shandong), the capital of Pinglu Circuit (), then ruled by Li Shigu; and Wei Prefecture (, in modern Handan, Hebei), the capital of Weibo Circuit (), then ruled by Tian Xu. On one occasion, he falsely accused his subordinate Yuan Hong () the prefect of Deng Prefecture (, in modern Nanyang, Henan) of corruption. After Emperor Dezong ordered that Yuan be exiled to Duan Prefecture (, in modern Zhaoqing, Guangdong), Yu seized Yuan from the eunuch sent to escort Yuan to exile, forcing the eunuch to flee back to Chang&#x27;an, and then submitted a petition complaining that Yuan was punished too harshly, and only after Emperor Dezong changed the punishment to demotion to be the secretary general of Ji Prefecture (, in modern Ji&#x27;an, Jiangxi) did Yu allow Yuan to leave. On another occasion, when Yu became angry with his assistant Xue Zhenglun (), he requested Emperor Dezong to demote Xue to be the secretary general of Xia Prefecture (, in modern Yichang, Hubei), but after Emperor Dezong issued the edict, Yu was no longer angry with Xue by that point, and submitted another petition to keep Xue as assistant. Emperor Dezong agreed with that request as well. After Xue died and before Xue was buried, Yu had soldiers surround Xue&#x27;s house and forced Xue&#x27;s daughter to marry Yu&#x27;s son born of a concubine. While Yu served at Shannan East Circuit, he was eventually created the Duke of Yan and, in 805, after Emperor Dezong&#x27;s grandson Emperor Xianzong became emperor, Yu was given the honorary chancellor title of &quot;Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi&quot; (). It was also said that he, without imperial permission, stationed troops at the important city of Nanyang, causing the imperial government such distress.

With Emperor Xianzong carrying out campaigns to reassert imperial power, Yu became apprehensive, and in or just before 807, he requested that a princess be married to his son Yu Jiyou (). The imperial scholar Li Jiang opposed on the grounds that Yu Di was from Xianbei ancestry and that Yu Jiyou was not even born of Yu Di&#x27;s wife but of a concubine. Emperor Xianzong, however, saw the advantages of agreeing to the proposal. Around the new year 808, Emperor Xianzong married his daughter Princess Puning to You Jiyou and sent much dowry with her. This surprised Yu Di, who was very pleased. Shortly after, Emperor Xianzong had other officials hint to Yu that he should personally pay homage to the emperor to thank him, a suggestion echoed by Yu Di&#x27;s son Yu Fang (). When Yu Di went to Chang&#x27;an to pay homage to Emperor Xianzong later in 808, he was made &quot;Sikong&quot; () and chancellor, and kept at Chang&#x27;an; he was replaced as the military governor of Shannan East Circuit by Pei Jun (). almost to the time he became king

== After return to Chang&#x27;an ==
However, it appeared that Yu Di did not exercise much actual chancellor responsibility, as, per the precedent of Du You, he only attended imperial meetings three times a month. Further, when he suggested to Emperor Xianzong that harsher punishments be instituted, Emperor Xianzong did not accept the proposal and further, in discussion with other chancellors, referred to Yu as being evil in submitting the proposal and wanting him to lose the hearts of the people.

Yu Di was not happy serving in this manner. In or shortly before 813, there was a man named Liang Zhengyan () who claimed to be a close relative of the powerful eunuch Liang Shouqian (), and Yu had his son Yu Min () bribe Liang Zhengyan, seeking to be made a military governor again. However, at a later point, Liang Zhengyan was revealed to be a fraud, and Yu Min demanded the return of the bribe, which Liang Zhengyan refused. In anger, Yu Min trapped Liang Zhengyan&#x27;s servant by trick, and killed and dismembered the servant. When this was discovered, Yu Di and Yu Jiyou went to the palace gate in mourning clothes to seek mercy, but the palace guards refused to let him meet the emperor. He was subsequently demoted to be the assistant to Emperor Xianzong&#x27;s granduncle Li Lian () the Prince of En, and he was denied further access to the emperor&#x27;s presence. Yu Min was exiled to Lei Prefecture (, in modern Zhanjiang, Guangdong), while Yu Di&#x27;s other sons were all demoted in rank. On the way to exile, Yu Min was ordered to commit suicide, while Liang Zhengyan and his associate, the Buddhist monk Jianxu () were executed. Later that year, Yu Di was elevated to the higher position of &quot;Taizi Binke&quot; (), an advisor to Emperor Xianzong&#x27;s crown prince Li Heng.

In 815, when Emperor Xianzong was conducting a campaign against Zhangyi, then ruled by Wu Yuanji (whose father Wu Shaoyang was not related by blood to Wu Shaocheng but was regarded as a cousin), many generals submitted their wealth to support the campaign. When Yu tried to submit a large amount of silver and gold, however, Emperor Xianzong refused to accept his submission. Subsequently, when Yu Jiyou was accused of lack of filial piety as he continued to feast when Yu Di&#x27;s wife (not his mother) died, Yu Di was stripped of his honorific title of &quot;Jinzi Guanglu Daifu&quot; () as he was considered to have failed to educate Yu Jiyou properly. In 818, Yu requested retirement, and traditionally, when an official sought retirement, he would be allowed to retire at a greater position than he actually held. The chancellors thus proposed giving him the greater position of &quot;Taizi Shaobao&quot; ()—also advisor to the crown prince, but at higher position. Emperor Xianzong disapproved and had him retire as &quot;Taizi Binke&quot;. He died later that year and was given posthumous honors but the posthumous name &quot;Li&quot; (, &quot;cruel&quot;). After Emperor Xianzong&#x27;s death and succession by Li Heng (as Emperor Muzong) in 820, Yu Jiyou, on an occasion when he attended a hunt with Emperor Muzong, pleaded with Emperor Muzong to give his father a more honorable posthumous name. Many officials opposed such a request, but Emperor Muzong eventually gave Yu Di the posthumous name of &quot;Si&quot; (, &quot;repentant&quot;).

<doc id="412573" wikidata="Q1782186" url="?curid=412573" title="River Cole, West Midlands">
<text>The River Cole is a river in the English Midlands. It rises on the lower slopes of Forhill, one of the south-western ramparts of the Birmingham Plateau, at Red Hill and flows south before flowing largely north-east across the plateau to enter the River Blythe below Coleshill, near Ladywalk, shortly before the Blythe meets the Tame. This then joins the Trent, whose waters reach the North Sea via the Humber Estuary. Its source is very near the main watershed of Midland England: tributaries are few and very short except in the lower reaches, so the Cole is only a small stream.

==Geology==
The average gradient of the central reaches is . There is a fast run-off from the drift covered Keuper marl clay which makes up its catchment area, and heavy rain produces sudden floods; in the absence of replenishing side-streams these subside as quickly as they rise. The Cole is normally shallow, except where weirs maintain an artificial depth.

==Etymology==
It bears a Celtic name derived from the old British word for hazel. In a charter of AD 972 of Pershore Abbey the river throughout Yardley is &#x27;Colle&#x27;. It has since borne several different local names:

==Description of the course==

A southern tributary rises in fields at Hob Hill, its course runs through farm land and is then joined in the vicinity of the aptly named Watery Lane by a northern tributary which rises in Redhill and crosses Kings Norton golf club. The combined river then is bridged by the A435, Alcester Road by the, now closed, Horse and Jockey Public House from where it crosses fields and Fulford Heath golf club to the east of Wythall before passing under an aqueduct for the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal on Peterbrook Road at Major&#x27;s Green. Skirting to the west of Shirley and passing the site and former mill pond of Bache Mill, it is joined on its eastern bank by the Shirley Brook which forms the boundary between Birmingham and Solihull.

===Shire Country Park===

Crossing Slade Lane at a ford, the &#x27;slade&#x27; is the Cole&#x27;s black silted boggy valley, it begins a journey through the seven kilometres, between Yardley Wood and Small Heath of the Shire Country Park. Firstly passing through Scribers Lane SINC (Site of Nature Conservation Interest), a diverse site with mixed broadleaf woodland containing wet flushes and ditches, a disused millrace and a wetland scrape. Over the past few years there have been reports of Eurasian otter, water vole and water rail in this area. It runs along the River to the Scribers Lane Ford. A leat also carries water to the mill race and former mill pond of Tritterford Mill. It is bridged at Highfield Road by what was formally Titterford wain bridge built in the early 19th century but now replaced by a new bridge by which Highfield Road sweeps across the river and up the hill to Christ Church. Due to the construction of the mill pool, Chinn Brook had to be diverted far into the Dingles, flowing at a lesser gradient than the river, until it could join the Cole at the same level. The river then flows through the Dingles where towards Brook Lane is Four Arches Bridge. First recorded in 1822, it formerly linked Webb and Old Brook Lanes. The wain ford alongside and the side approached have disappeared. When the North Warwickshire Line was being built between 1906/7, its embankment cut off both Webb Lane and Robin Hood Lane and to avoid the cost of two bridges so close together, a single span was placed centrally and the lanes diverted to it. Both fords then went out of use. For two decades the Four Arches Bridge continued to be used, but then Cole Valley Road was built up and thenceforward the bridge led nowhere, and it was allowed to fall into ruin until only the arch courses and piers remained. A local campaign succeeded in achieving its handsome restoration. The race to Sarehole Mill formerly went under Brook Lane in a culvert, but this has been blocked and the line of the race is lost to northward. The spillway from race to river is seen to be still there, and the slots for the removable plank weir can be seen. The riverside walk continues as the John Morris Jones Walkway past the site of Robin Hood Lane ford, across Cotterills Meadow which has been Colebank Playing Field for the last ninety years until it reaches the Grade II Listed water mill, Sarehole Mill at Hall Green. The Coldbath Brook, a tributary of the Cole, drives the mill which is now a museum and one of the inspirations for J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The Shire Country Park ranger office is located at Sarehole Mill.

Tolkien and his brother spent their childhood in Birmingham with their widowed mother. They first lived in the hamlet of Sarehole, which Tolkien said were the happiest years of his youth. Sarehole is said to have been the model for The Shire, home to the hobbits. Every year the Tolkien Weekend is held at Sarehole Recreation Ground and Moseley Bog Local Nature Reserve part of the Shire Country Park. 2005 commemorated the 50th anniversary of the release of The Lord of the Rings. Ronald and his brother spent many hours playing around Sarehole Mill and being chased away by the miller&#x27;s son. The Mill features in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; when Bilbo Baggins runs &quot;as fast as his furry feet could carry him down the lane, past the great Mill, across The Water and then on for a mile or more.&quot; In the 1960s Tolkien contributed to a public appeal to restore the mill which had become dilapidated. It is now a museum and is the only surviving water mill in the City&#x27;s ownership.

Continuing to Green Lane ford which, like those at Slade and Scribbers Lane, has been concreted and the wooden footbridge is the latest of many, earlier ones have been swept away by sudden torrents. When the meadow below Green Road was opened as part of the riverside walk in the 1960s, the Cole was re-coursed and two weirs topped by step-stones were installed. Next, the river crosses the A3400, Stratford Road, the site of the former 13th-century Greet Mill, whose pool was the ponded river. In 1914 two brick bridges, over the river channel and a flood-race, were replaced by a two-arched brick bridge with a stone balustrade which allowed tramcars to cross the river and go on to Hall Green. The mill went out of use about 1843, was demolished and forgotten.

Between Stratford Road and Formans Road, known in the 14th century as Foulemoreslone and which used the Fole- or Fullford (foul ford) the stretch is known as Blackberry Way, being named after consultation with local residents and highly suitable, as this is one of the best blackberry picking sections of The Shire Country Park.

The river is bridged by the A41, Warwick Road at Greet, there is no documentary evidence for a ford here, and then continues north, passing under the Grand Union Canal and the Chiltern Main Line railway at Hay Mills close to the Ackers trust outdoor pursuits centre.

===Kingfisher Country Park===

Passing under Hay Mills bridge it crosses the A45, Coventry Road and from here eleven kilometres of the river and the Cole Valley are protected by the Kingfisher Country Park. The river now skirts south east of Birmingham city centre and, passing under the M6 motorway at Chelmsley Wood, heads north east again towards Coleshill, to which it gave its name.

The river has the potential to flood during heavy rain and the Stratford Roads&#x27; Greet Mill ford shows how treacherous the river could be after heavy rain as the assizes rolls of 1275 record that, Roger Fullard wishing to cross the water with his cart at the mill of Greet, by the flooding water, he and his horses were drowned. Babbs Mill Lake was created to balance the effect.

<text>Classical mythology, also known as Greco-Roman mythology or Greek and Roman mythology, is the collective body and study of myths from the ancient Greeks and ancient Romans. Mythology, along with philosophy and political thought, is one of the major survivals of classical antiquity throughout later, including modern, Western culture. The Greek word &quot;mythos&quot; refers to the spoken word or speech, but it also denotes a tale, story or narrative.

As late as the Roman conquest of Greece during the last two centuries Before the Common Era and for centuries afterwards, the Romans, who already had gods of their own, adopted many mythic narratives directly from the Greeks while preserving their own Roman (Latin) names for the gods. As a result, the actions of many Roman and Greek deities became equivalent in storytelling and literature in modern Western culture. For example, the Roman sky god Jupiter or Jove became equated with his Greek counterpart Zeus; the Roman fertility goddess Venus with the Greek goddess Aphrodite; and the Roman sea god Neptune with the Greek god Poseidon.

Latin remained the dominant language in Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, largely due to the widespread influence of the Roman Empire. During this period, mythological names almost always appeared in their Latin form. However, in the 19th century, there was a shift towards the use of either the Greek or Roman names. For example, &quot;Zeus&quot; and &quot;Jupiter&quot; both became widely used in that century as the name of the supreme god of the classical pantheon.

==Classical myth==
The stories and characters found in Greco-Roman mythology are not considered real in terms of the same way that historical or scientific facts are real. They are not factual accounts of events that occurred. Instead, Greco-Roman mythology is a collection of ancient stories, legends, and beliefs that were created by the people of ancient Greece and Rome to explain aspects of the world around them, express cultural values, and provide a framework for understanding their existence. These myths often involve gods, heroes, goddesses, afterwar appearances, and other supernatural beings, and they were an integral part of the religious and cultural practices of the time. While these myths are not considered historically accurate, they hold cultural and literary significance.

Greek myths were narratives related to ancient Greek religion, often concerned with the actions of gods and other supernatural beings and of heroes who transcend human bounds. Major sources for Greek myths include the Homeric epics, that is, the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Known versions are mostly preserved in sophisticated literary works shaped by the artistry of individuals and by the conventions of genre, or in vase painting and other forms of visual art. In these forms, mythological narratives often serve purposes that are not primarily religious, such as entertainment and even comedy (&quot;The Frogs&quot;), or the exploration of social issues (&quot;Antigone&quot;).

Roman myths are traditional stories pertaining to ancient Rome&#x27;s legendary origins, religious institutions, and moral models, with a focus on human actors and only occasional intervention from deities but a pervasive sense of divinely ordered destiny. Roman myths have a dynamic relation to Roman historiography, as in the early books of Livy&#x27;s &quot;Ab urbe condita&quot;. The most famous Roman myth may be the birth of Romulus and Remus and the founding of the city, in which fratricide can be taken as expressing the long history of political division in the Roman Republic.

As late as the Hellenistic period of Greek influence and primarily through the Roman conquest of Greece, the Romans identified their own gods with those of the Greeks, keeping their own Roman names but adopting the Greek stories told about them (see &quot;interpretatio graeca&quot;) and importing other myths for which they had no counterpart. For instance, while the Greek god Ares and the Italic god Mars are both war deities, the role of each in his society and its religious practices differed often strikingly; but in literature and Roman art, the Romans reinterpreted stories about Ares under the name of Mars. The literary collection of Greco-Roman myths with the greatest influence on later Western culture was the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; of the Augustan poet Ovid.

Syncretized versions form the classical tradition of mythography, and by the time of the influential Renaissance mythographer Natalis Comes (16th century), few if any distinctions were made between Greek and Roman myths. The myths as they appear in popular culture of the 20th and 21st centuries often have only a relation to the stories as told in ancient Greek and Latin literature.

The people living in the Renaissance era, who primarily studied the Christian teachings, Classical mythology found a way to be told from the freshly found ancient sources that authors and directors used for plays and stories for the retelling of these myths.


Professor John Th. Honti stated that &quot;many myths of Graeco-Roman antiquity&quot; show &quot;a nucleus&quot; that appear in &quot;some later common European folk-tale&quot;.

Mythology was not the only borrowing that the Romans made from Greek culture. Rome took over and adapted many categories of Greek culture: philosophy, rhetoric, history, epic, tragedy and their forms of art. In these areas, and more, Rome took over and developed the Greek originals for their own needs. Some scholars argue that the reason for this “borrowing” is largely, among many other things, the chronology of the two cultures. Professor Elizabeth Vandiver says Greece was the first culture in the Mediterranean, then Rome second.

<text>Willem Cornelisz Schouten ( – 1625) was a Dutch navigator for the Dutch East India Company. He was the first to sail the Cape Horn route to the Pacific Ocean.

== Biography ==
Willem Cornelisz Schouten was born in c. 1567 in Hoorn, Holland, Seventeen Provinces.

In April 1601 Willem Schouten was skipper of the Duyfken in the &#x27;Moluccan fleet&#x27; of Wolfert Hermansz, and participated in the Battle of Bantam.

On July 1, 1615 Willem Schouten and his younger brother Jan Schouten sailed from Texel in the Netherlands, in an expedition led by Jacob Le Maire and sponsored by Isaac Le Maire and his in equal shares with Schouten. The expedition consisted of two ships: &quot;Eendracht&quot; and &quot;Hoorn&quot;. A main purpose of the voyage was to search for &quot;Terra Australis&quot;. A further objective was to explore a western route to the Pacific Ocean to evade the trade restrictions of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in the Spice Islands. In 1616 Schouten rounded Cape Horn, which he named after the recently destroyed ship &quot;Hoorn&quot;, and the Dutch city of Hoorn, after which the lost ship was named, the town in which Schouten himself was born. Schouten named the strait itself &quot;Le Maire Strait&quot;. Jan Schouten died on 9 March 1616 after the expedition left Juan Fernández. He crossed the Pacific along a southern role, discovering a number of atolls in the Tuamotu Islands, including Puka-Puka, Manihi, Rangiroa and Takapoto, followed by Tafahi, Niuafoʻou and Niuatoputapu in the Tonga Islands, and Alofi and Futuna in the Wallis and Futuna Islands. He then followed the north coasts of New Ireland and New Guinea and visited adjacent islands, including what became known as the Schouten Islands before reaching Ternate in September 1616. The &quot;Eendracht&quot; completed the navigation and returned to the Netherlands on July 1, 1617.

Although he had opened an unknown route (south of Cape Horn) for the Dutch, the VOC claimed infringement of its monopoly of trade to the Spice Islands. Schouten was arrested (and later released) and his ship confiscated in Java. On his return he would sail again for the VOC, and on one of these trips he died off the coast of Madagascar in 1625.

Abel Tasman later used Schouten&#x27;s charts during his exploration of the north coast of New Guinea.

==First publications==

Schouten described his travels in the &quot;Journal,&quot; published in a Dutch edition at Amsterdam in 1618 and soon translated into several other languages.
* Dutch edition: &quot;.&quot; Amsterdam: Willem Jansz. 1618.
* French edition: &quot;&quot; ... Amsterdam: Willem Jansz. 1618.
* English edition: &quot;The Relation of a Wonderfull Voiage made by Willem Cornelison Schouten of Horne. Shewing how South from the Straights of Magelan in Terra Delfuego: he found and discovered a newe passage through the great South Seaes, and that way sayled round about the world&quot;. London: Imprinted by T.D. for Nathanaell Newbery. 1619.
* German edition: &quot; ...&quot; Frankfurt am Main. 1619.
* Latin edition: &quot;...&quot; Amsterdam: Janson. 1619.

Among historians, including A. L. Rowse, there is no consensus about the authorship of this &quot;Journal&quot;. Schouten has got the credit for it, and thus the voyage has come down to us under his name. The Dutch, French, German and Latin texts all have nine engraved maps and plates, which are not present in the English version, &quot;The Relation of a Wonderfull Voiage&quot;.

<text>The is a peripheral that allows Game Boy cartridges to be played on a Super Nintendo Entertainment System console. Released in June 1994, it retailed for in the United States and in the United Kingdom. In South Korea, it is called the Super Mini Comboy and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics. A revised model, the Super Game Boy 2, was released in Japan in January 1998.

==Functionality==
The Super Game Boy is compatible with the same cartridges as the original Game Boy: original Game Boy cartridges, the Game Boy Camera, and dual-mode Game Boy Color cartridges (in Game Boy-mode). The unit could map the four shades of green to various colors on the screen. Later Game Boy games that were optimized to use the Super Game Boy had additional color information and could override the on-screen colors, display a graphical border around the screen, and display special background sprites, as seen in the &quot;Mario&#x27;s Picross&quot; title screen. Those games would have printed a small &quot;Super Game Boy Game Pak&quot; logo on the box and cartridge. The adaptor could support up to 64 colors for the border, and 12 colors for the screen. Static screens could display all 10 colors. Certain games can load multiple borders depending on the player&#x27;s location in the game, such as &quot;Dragon Warrior I &amp; II&quot;.

It is also possible for Super Game Boy games to make use of the Super NES hardware for extra effects, as demonstrated in &quot;&quot;, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land 2&quot;, &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Madden &#x27;97&quot;, &quot;Animaniacs&quot; and &quot;Toy Story&quot;; these games had expanded sound when used with the Super Game Boy. &quot;Wario Blast&quot;, the Game Boy version of &quot;Primal Rage&quot;, the Game Boy version of &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; and several other titles even allowed the second Super NES controller to be used for two-player action. The title screen changed to show that these games had a two-player option, rather than a connection status. Using the Super Multitap, some games even supported four players. The original Super Game Boy does not support game link multiplayer because, according to a Nintendo spokesman, a two-player configuration would interfere with the RF signal from the television.

The Game Boy version of &quot;Space Invaders&quot; allowed players to access a Super NES version of the game as well as a colored version of the Game Boy game. The Super NES version is copied into and run from the console&#x27;s internal 256KiB work RAM.

Some black Game Boy Color cartridge games also have Super Game Boy enhancements, although there is not any logo indicating this on the cartridge or on the front of the box as there are for original Game Boy releases. Several GBC titles do have a small Super Game Boy compatibility icon located on the back of their packaging, such as for &quot;Dragon Warrior Monsters 2: Cobi&#x27;s Journey&quot;.

==Hardware==
Because the Super NES cannot emulate the Game Boy hardware at full speed, the Super Game Boy actually consists of the same hardware as the original handheld; inside the cartridge is a separate CPU that processes the games while the Super NES only provided means for user-input, output of graphics to the screen, and the additional coloring.

The original Super Game Boy is known to play the game program and its audio 2.4% faster than other Game Boy hardware. This is due to the use of the Super NES&#x27;s clock speed divided by 5, which ends up being 4.295 MHz instead of 4.194 MHz.

===Super Game Boy 2===

The Super Game Boy 2 was released only in Japan in January 1998. Additions included a link port to allow a user to access two-player mode via the link cable, the green game link LED, and the red power LED indicator, and it runs at the exact speed of the Game Boy (the original model runs 2.4% faster than a Game Boy). In addition, it came with eight new default borders, which replaced those in the original model (though the old borders are still accessible via a code); however, it retained the same built-in palettes and coloring tools as on the original model. Also, this version of the SGB does not allow one to change borders in some games that have built-in borders. Some games have features only available through the Super Game Boy 2, such as a special &quot;Tetris DX&quot; border.

==System menu==
The system menu is accessed by pressing the L and R buttons at the same time; the menu has five options to choose from:
*Color Palette: Choose from one of 32 pre-made color palettes, the Super Game Boy enhanced palette(s) (if available), or a user-created palette (if available). A few Super Game Boy games will not allow the palette to be changed. Internally, the Super Game Boy includes special palettes for several games that came out before the release of the Super Game Boy; for example, &quot;Alleyway&quot;, &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Cookie&quot;, &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Pinball Land&quot;, &quot;Metroid II: Return of Samus&quot;, and &quot;Solar Striker&quot; have 1 of the 32 default colors by default.
*Border: Choose from one of 9 pre-made borders, the Super Game Boy enhanced border(s) (if available), or a user-created border (if created).
*Button Setting: Switches between two controller mappings. A few Super Game Boy games will not allow the controller setting to be changed.
*Custom Color: Create a custom color palette and get a password to retrieve it later. If palette changes are disabled within the game, this option will also be unavailable.
*Graffiti: Create a custom border by using several painting tools. If plugged into the second controller port, the Super NES Mouse could be used for this feature.
Some games disable the use of changing colors, so the unavailable options are blacked out.

==Predecessors and successors==
The Super Game Boy is the successor to Intelligent Systems&#x27; Wide Boy (which connected to the Famicom or NES). One difference between the Wide Boy and the Super Game Boy is that the former did not use any part of the Famicom/NES other than the video memory. Even the controller (a single Famicom controller) is hardwired directly into the Wide Boy. The Wide Boy would continue running even if the reset button is held down on the Famicom/NES. The Game Boy had twice as many tiles as could fit in the Famicom/NES&#x27;s video memory, so the Wide Boy had to refresh the Famicom/NES&#x27;s video memory halfway down the screen.

Camerica had a Game Boy to NES adaptor developed by Biederman Design Labs, which appeared similar to the Super Game Boy.

The Super Game Boy was followed by the Transfer Pak for the Nintendo 64, which allowed one to play the six (seven in Japan) Game Boy and Game Boy Color Pokémon titles in &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot; in a Super Game Boy-like fashion, complete with the Super Game Boy enhanced borders and palettes. The games were played via the use of a software emulator on the Nintendo 64. However, the main role of the Transfer Pak was to transfer data from Game Boy Color to Nintendo 64 games, not to play games.

The Wide-Boy64 was released for the N64 in two major versions, the CGB version which allowed Game Boy and Game Boy Color titles to be played on a television, and the AGB version which also allowed Game Boy Advance games to be played. It cost $1400, and like the original Wide Boy, it was only available to developers and the gaming press. These devices were used to take screenshots of Nintendo handheld video games to be in retail media.

The GB Hunter is one of two Nintendo 64 items released by EMS Production Ltd., the other being the N64 Passport - a Game Boy emulator for the Nintendo 64. An N64 game is plugged into the back of the item and a Game Boy cartridge is plugged into the top. The N64 game requires a 6102 CIC. Like the Super Game Boy, it connects to the N64&#x27;s cartridge slot, and makes it possible to play Game Boy games on it without the game&#x27;s sound; instead, the GB Hunter&#x27;s built-in theme song is looped endlessly during the game. There is also a cheating device programmed into it, called the &quot;Golden Finger&quot; (like the Game Shark), along with a trainer option to determine the RAM values that decrement, increment, change, or stay the same. This can provide certain cheat codes to try out in the game. Holding the &#x27;L&#x27; and &#x27;R&#x27; buttons simultaneously will cause the game to freeze at that point and the GB Hunter Menu to appear. The game screen can be maximized or minimized from this menu, allowing the player to play the game in fullscreen. The color palette can also be changed from the menu, to view the game in a custom variation of the 3 different palettes available to the Game Boy PPU, using RGB values. These palettes correspond to the background and two sprite palettes. There are also 4 preset borders to place around the game, with the added support of SGB borders. Most sellers of this item on eBay, and other places such as the EMS site itself, do not mention that the Game Boy game audio is not heard while being played on the GB Hunter.

Datel&#x27;s GameBooster technology was sold in the west by EMS and branded as the GB Hunter. It was released for the Nintendo 64 halfway through the console&#x27;s lifespan. It was not officially licensed by Nintendo as it had a slot at the back for an N64 game to override the lockout technology in the system. Datel also made a version for Sony&#x27;s PlayStation console, which uses the Parallel I/O port on the back of the console, not found on the Series 9000 models of the system or the slimline PSone system. This version has a graphically better theme, lacks the song that is played in the N64 version, has battery save support, and has a built-in game titled &quot;Rebound Mission&quot;, although the palette customizer only has one palette as opposed to three. However, it has a built-in music CD player which can be used to mimick the original Game Boy game audio. The GameBooster was also rebranded as the PowerFlash, though many differences are unknown other than the name change.

On the GameCube, the Game Boy Player was released in 2003, which could play Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games. It allowed these games to be played on a full television screen. The GBP attaches to the bottom of the console and a boot disc must be running in the GameCube disc drive in order to boot it, although the disc can be removed afterwards. The Game Boy Player functions just like a Game Boy Advance, letterboxing the games&#x27; display on a standard television set. Some GBA games were programmed with consideration for the Player, including activating the vibration feature in GameCube controllers and special color palettes which accounted for a TV&#x27;s brightness and resolution. However, the Game Boy Player will not activate Super Game Boy options on a Super Game Boy enhanced cartridge. Also, when playing a Game Boy or Game Boy Color game on the Game Boy Player, a black border will appear between the main border and the gameplay area; this is a carry-over from the Game Boy Advance.

==Peripherals==

In Japan, Hori released a special Super Game Boy controller called the SGB Commander. The controller, aside from the 4 Game Boy buttons (A, B, Start and Select), also has 4 Super Game Boy specific buttons which can enable the user to mute the sound, reduce the speed of the game, change the colors and modify the display window. An additional switch is provided to alternate between Super Game Boy mode and regular Super Famicom Mode.

==Guide==
In 1994, shortly after the Super Game Boy release, Nintendo sent the Nintendo Power magazine subscribers the &quot;Super Game Boy Player&#x27;s Guide&quot;, a 72-page instruction book / guide to using the features of the Super Game Boy. The first 15 pages were instructional, followed by 55 pages of very brief overview style walkthrough of several games. These walkthroughs highlighted various points of the games and often pointed out color schemes to set that area&#x27;s intended mood. Games included &quot;Super Mario Land&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins&quot;, &quot;Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3&quot;, the newly released &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (which had a special &quot;Super Game Boy&quot; border and color palette), &quot;Metroid II: Return of Samus&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;, &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot;, &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Pinball Land&quot;, &quot;Tennis&quot;, &quot;Nintendo World Cup&quot;, &quot;Alleyway&quot;, &quot;Dr. Mario&quot;, and &quot;Yoshi&quot;.

<text>An American depositary receipt (abbreviated ADR, and sometimes spelled &quot;depository&quot;) is a negotiable security that represents securities of a foreign company and allows that company&#x27;s shares to trade in the U.S. financial markets.

Shares of many non-U.S. companies trade on U.S. stock exchanges through ADRs, which are denominated and pay dividends in U.S. dollars, and may be traded like regular shares of stock. ADRs are also traded during U.S. trading hours, through U.S. broker-dealers. ADRs simplify investing in foreign securities because the depositary bank &quot;manage[s] all custody, currency and local taxes issues&quot;.

The first ADR was introduced by J.P. Morgan in 1927 for the British retailer Selfridges on the New York Curb Exchange, the American Stock Exchange&#x27;s precursor.

They are the U.S. equivalent of a global depository receipt (GDR). Securities of a foreign company that are represented by an ADR are called American depositary shares (ADSs).

==Depositary receipts==
ADRs are one type of depositary receipt (DR), which are any negotiable securities that represent securities of companies that are foreign to the market on which the DR trades. DRs enable domestic investors to buy securities of foreign companies without the accompanying risks or inconveniences of cross-border and cross-currency transactions. Companies may choose to issue depository receipts in another jurisdiction for a host of commercial reasons including signalling to their investors and clients about their enhanced corporate governance standard.

Each ADR is issued by a domestic custodian bank when the underlying shares are deposited in a foreign depositary bank, usually by a broker who has purchased the shares in the open market local to the foreign company. An ADR can represent a fraction of a share, a single share, or multiple shares of a foreign security. The holder of a DR has the right to obtain the underlying foreign security that the DR represents, but investors usually find it more convenient to own the DR. The price of a DR generally tracks the price of the foreign security in its home market, adjusted for the ratio of DRs to foreign company shares. In the case of companies domiciled in the United Kingdom, creation of ADRs attracts a 1.5% creation fee; this creation fee is different than stamp duty reserve tax charge by the UK government. Depositary banks have various responsibilities to DR holders and to the issuing foreign company the DR represents.

==ADR programs (facilities)==
When a company establishes an ADR program, it must decide what exactly it wants out of the program, and how much time, effort, and other resources they are willing to commit. For this reason, there are different types of programs, or facilities, that a company can choose.

===Unsponsored ADRs===
Unsponsored shares trade on the over-the-counter (OTC) market. These shares are issued in accordance with market demand, and the foreign company has no formal agreement with a depositary bank. Unsponsored ADRs are often issued by more than one depositary bank. Each depositary services only the ADRs it has issued. Since the company is not formally involved in an unsponsored issue, the motivation of the company to list overseas is irrelevant for unsponsored programs. Instead, the dynamics of this market is determined by the incentive structure of three types of players: holders of the securities on-shore, the investors in depository receipts off-shore and the intermediaries (depository banks and exchanges).

===Sponsored Level I ADRs (&quot;OTC&quot; facility)===
Level 1 depositary receipts are the lowest level of sponsored ADRs that can be issued. When a company issues sponsored ADRs, it has one designated depositary who also acts as its transfer agent.

A majority of American depositary receipt programs currently trading are issued through a Level 1 program. This is the most convenient way for a foreign company to have its equity traded in the United States.

Level 1 shares can only be traded on the OTC market and the company has minimal reporting requirements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company is not required to issue quarterly or annual reports in compliance with U.S. GAAP. However, the company must have a security listed on one or more stock exchanges in a foreign jurisdiction and must publish in English on its website its annual report in the form required by the laws of the country of incorporation, organization, or domicile.

Companies with shares trading under a Level 1 program may decide to upgrade their program to a Level 2 or Level 3 program for better exposure in the United States markets.

===Sponsored Level II ADRs (&quot;Listing&quot; facility)===
Level 2 depositary receipt programs are more complicated for a foreign company. When a foreign company wants to set up a Level 2 program, it must file a registration statement with the SEC and is under SEC regulation. In addition, the company is required to file a Form 20-F annually. Form 20-F is the basic equivalent of an annual report (Form 10-K) for a U.S. company. In their filings, the company is required to follow U.S. GAAP standards or the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as published by the IASB.

The advantage that the company has by upgrading their program to Level 2 is that the shares can be listed on a U.S. stock exchange. These exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NASDAQ, and the NYSE MKT.

While listed on these exchanges, the company must meet the exchange&#x27;s listing requirements. If it fails to do so, it may be delisted and forced to downgrade its ADR program.

===Sponsored Level III ADRs (&quot;offering&quot; facility)===
A Level 3 American Depositary Receipt program is the highest level a foreign company can sponsor. Because of this distinction, the company is required to adhere to stricter rules that are similar to those followed by U.S. companies.

Setting up a Level 3 program means that the foreign company is not only taking steps to permit shares from its home market to be deposited into an ADR program and traded in the United States; it is actually issuing shares to raise capital. In accordance with this offering, the company is required to file a Form F-1, which is the format for a prospectus for the shares. They also must file a Form 20-F annually and must adhere to U.S. GAAP standards or IFRS as published by the IASB. In addition, any material information given to shareholders in the home market, must be filed with the SEC through Form 6-K.

Foreign companies with Level 3 programs will often issue materials that are more informative and are more accommodating to their U.S. shareholders because they rely on them for capital. Overall, foreign companies with a Level 3 program set up are the easiest on which to find information. Examples include Vodafone, Petrobras, and China Information Technology, Inc. (CNIT).

===Restricted programs===
Foreign companies that want their stock to be limited to being traded by only certain individuals may set up a restricted program. There are two SEC rules that allow this type of issuance of shares in the United States: Rule 144-A and Regulation S. ADR programs operating under one of these two rules make up approximately 30% of all issued ADRs.

====Privately placed (SEC Rule 144A) ADRs====
Some foreign companies will set up an ADR program under SEC Rule 144A. This provision makes the issuance of shares a private placement. Shares of companies registered under Rule 144-A are restricted stock and may only be issued to or traded by qualified institutional buyers (QIBs).

U.S. public shareholders are generally not permitted to invest in these ADR programs, and most are held exclusively through the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation, so there is often very little information on these companies.

Characteristics include: 
* It is a secured security.
* A fixed rate of interest is paid.
* Can be converted into multiple shares.

====Offshore (SEC Regulation S) ADRs====
The other way to restrict the trading of depositary shares to U.S. public investors is to issue them under the terms of SEC Regulation S. This regulation means that the shares are not, and will not be registered with any U.S. securities regulation authority.

Regulation S shares cannot be held or traded by any &quot;U.S. person&quot; as defined by SEC Regulation S rules. The shares are registered and issued to offshore, non-U.S. residents.

Regulation S ADRs can be merged into a Level 1 program after the restriction period has expired, and the foreign issuer elects to do this.

==Sourcing ADRs==
One can either source new ADRs by depositing the corresponding domestic shares of the company with the depositary bank that administers the ADR program or, instead, one can obtain existing ADRs in the secondary market. The latter can be achieved either by purchasing the ADRs on a U.S. stock exchange or via purchasing the underlying domestic shares of the company on their primary exchange and then swapping them for ADRs; these swaps are called &quot;crossbook swaps&quot; and on many occasions account for the bulk of ADR secondary trading. This is especially true in the case of trading in ADRs of UK companies where creation of new ADRs attracts a 1.5% stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) charge by the UK government; sourcing existing ADRs in the secondary market (either via crossbook swaps or on exchange) instead is not subject to SDRT.

==ADR termination==
Most ADR programs are subject to possible termination. Termination of the ADR agreement will result in cancellation of all the depositary receipts, and a subsequent delisting from all exchanges where they trade. The termination can be at the discretion of the foreign issuer or the depositary bank, but is typically at the request of the issuer. There may be a number of reasons why ADRs terminate, but in most cases the foreign issuer is undergoing some type of reorganization or merger. 
Owners of ADRs are typically notified in writing at least thirty days prior to a termination. Once notified, an owner can surrender their ADRs and take delivery of the foreign securities represented by the Receipt, or do nothing. If an ADR holder elects to take possession of the underlying foreign shares, there is no guarantee the shares will trade on any U.S. exchange. The holder of the foreign shares would have to find a broker who has trading authority in the foreign market where those shares trade. If the owner continues to hold the ADR past the effective date of termination, the depositary bank will continue to hold the foreign deposited securities and collect dividends, but will cease distributions to ADR owners.

Usually up to one year after the effective date of the termination, the depositary bank will liquidate and allocate the proceeds to those respective clients. Many US brokerages can continue to hold foreign stock, but may lack the ability to trade it overseas.

==Example==
In 2013 a China-based company composed of various offshore holding companies called Autohome (ATHM) offered 7,820,000 American depositary shares (ADSs) representing its 7,820,000 Class A Ordinary Shares from its initial public offering. Details can be found from its prospectus dated December 16, 2013, under Registration No. 333-192085 filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1933.

<text>Haversham is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Haversham-cum-Little Linford, in the City of Milton Keynes unitary authority area, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is situated to the north of (and separated by the River Great Ouse from) the Milton Keynes urban area, near Wolverton and about north of Central Milton Keynes.

The village name is an Old English word that means &#x27;Haefer&#x27;s homestead&#x27;. In the Domesday Book of 1086, when it belonged to the Peverell family, it was listed as &quot;Havresham&quot;. The ancient manor house in the village, which was fortified in 1304, was largely burnt down, but parts of it still remain in a farm house just outside the main village.

Haversham was once a village of farm-workers&#x27; dwellings. , only Hill Farm, Grange Farm and Crossroads Farm remain as active working farms. The village has two distinct settlements separated by farmland. The older part of the village contains the manor house. It lies at elevations between 60 metres and 65 metres above mean sea level, just above the flood plain of the Ouse. In the 1930s, &#x27;New Haversham&#x27; was built nearer Wolverton, to house staff working at the Wolverton railway works nearby. New Haversham contains the primary school and is on ground at elevations between 65 metres and 75 metres, overlooking the Ouse Valley.

In the 1970s, ARC dug the river meadows near the site of the old village of Stanton Low for gravel extraction, leaving behind the large man made lakes that surround Haversham to the south today. These lakes are the home to the Hanson Centre and to the Haversham Sailing Club, one of the sailing clubs around Milton Keynes.

Just south of Haversham beside the road to Wolverton, is the Wolverton Railway Viaduct over the valley of the river Great Ouse, of a Stephenson&#x27;s design, carrying the West Coast Main Line.

The village gave its name to HMS &quot;Haversham&quot;, a Ham class minesweeper.

==Civil parish==
Haversham is in the civil parish of Haversham-cum-Little Linford, which also includes Little Linford. This merged parish was formed on 1 April 1934 following a County Review order when Little Linford parish was merged with Haversham. In 1931 the parish of Haversham had a population of 164. It formed part of the Newport Pagnell Rural District until 1974 when, as with the rest of NPRD, it became part of the (Buckinghamshire) District of Milton Keynes subsequently renamed the City of Milton Keynes unitary authority.

===Listed buildings and structures===
The parish has one scheduled ancient monument, one grade I listed building, two grade II* and nine grade II, including Wolverton Viaduct, an 1830s railway bridge.

<text>Hawridge ( ; recorded as Hoquerug in the 12th century) is a small village in the Chilterns in the county of Buckinghamshire, England and bordering the county boundary with Hertfordshire. It is from Chesham, from both Tring and Berkhamsted. Hawridge is one of four villages making up Cholesbury-cum-St Leonards, a civil parish.

It is a rural community but the agricultural economy is small and most local people rely for employment on neighbouring towns, the proximity of London, the availability of broadband technology or local tourism and the popularity of the area for recreational activities.

==Geography==
Before the incorporation of additional land from adjacent parishes, Hawridge historically comprised some . It is located in the main along a ridge on the dip slope within the Chiltern downland landscape. It is some 590 ft (182 m) above sea level.

===Geology===
The geology of the area has dictated the land use. The soil comprises gravely clay, intermixed with flints, small pebbles, and öolite over a chalk formation. Several examples of puddingstones a characteristic form of this aggregate have been found locally. There are no streams in the area due to the porous chalk sub soil. In places the occurrence of clay close to the surface accounts for several natural ponds fed by springs. Until connection with mains water in the mid-20th century, the scarcity of water had necessitated the sinking of deep wells and capture of rainwater.

===Land use===
In contrast to nearby areas of the Chilterns more land is given over to open space i.e. agricultural, both arable and pasture; paddocks; heathland and most significantly the Common along one side of which the majority of houses are arranged. There is relatively little mature ancient woodland remaining as most was cleared mainly during the 18th century and given over to beech plantation connected with the furniture making industry in High Wycombe. Both chalk and a small amount of clay have been extracted over the years, Meanwhile, in more recent times flint was dug out for road making. Both activities have left their mark in the form of small mounds and shallow depressions.

Historically, many homes had access to orchards, gardens for vegetable production and pasture for domestic animals. These have largely disappeared and over the last ten years or so the increasing popularity of horse riding has created a demand for suitable land for paddocks.

===Settlement===
Villages in this part of the Chilterns are often set out around Greens and Commons or strung out along ridges with which they connect often without a gap to adjacent settlements. Despite being not far distant from Chesham, Hawridge is consequently more closely linked in this way with the neighbouring villages of Cholesbury, St Leonards and Buckland Common. Heath End is a hamlet which has always been closely associated with Hawridge although historically part of the settlement had been in Hertfordshire until the second half of 20th century. The name probably derives from its location on the edge of Wigginton Heath.

Until 1935 Hawridge did not have mains water. Drainage did not arrive until 1963. The road down to Chesham was frequently impassable in winter and periodic flooding has still occurred even in recent years. The Second World War resulted in an influx of people escaping the London Blitz and not returning afterwards. This migration had a lasting effect with more houses built or greatly enlarged or refurbished. Transport improvements enabling daily commuting to London from the 1950s onwards also led to a further change with the growth in more affluent families which irrevocably changed the composition of the village community.

Concerns in the 1960s about uncontrolled housing development encouraged the establishment of resident&#x27;s groups focussed on preserving the village scene. Situated in the Chilterns AONB, and combined with national and local government planning controls there is strict enforcement of restrictions on residential building developments. This has led to a shortage in affordable and social housing. The scarcity of available property has added a premium onto house prices in Hawridge (average selling price circa £700k as at 2007) and neighbouring villages compared to other areas in the rest of the South-east of England.

==History==

===Early settlement===

====Prehistoric====
There is evidence of prehistoric settlement from archaeological finds, including a Palaeolithic handaxe found at the hamlet of Heath End, having probably arrived with road materials transported to the site. Mesolithic and neolithic tranchet axe-heads were found near Haddens Plantation and Heath End Farm. From finds such as a late Bronze Age sword, now at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford it has been concluded that there was a permanent settlement in the area from around 600BC.

====Anglo-Saxon====
The original village name &quot;Aucrug&quot; is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &quot;ridge frequented by hawks&quot;. There is evidence of trading activity through finds of coins spanning from around 4th Century, the late Roman period of Valentinian I, and about 1450 during the reign of Edward IV.

====Medieval====
Adjacent to White Hawridge Bottom is evidence of strip lynchets and terraces built around 11th century. Lynchets are the result of ploughing accumulating earth on the lowest point of the slope and building up a terrace of flatter ground on square or rectangular early medieval fields. At Hawridge Court there is a medieval manor house dating from the 13th century enclosed by earlier ringwork, comprising a single rampart and ditch.

===English Civil War===
Hawridge is said to have associations with the English Civil War during the 1640s Parliamentary soldiers were billeted in the area at a time when skirmishes were occurring in and around Wendover and Chesham. Adjacent to Horseblock Lane, which crosses Hawridge Common, may have been where their horses were quartered. It has also been said that during one particularly fierce skirmish with the Royalists, dead horses were used to form a barricade from which the name of the lane is derived.

===Lords of the Manor===
The manor of Hawridge is not mentioned in the Domesday Book. The first attributed with ownership of the lands was Robert D&#x27;Oyly, who died in 1091, and following a period of major land reassignment the manor appears to have been granted to Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick and remained with successive Earls of Warwick. The first records show from the 13th century the manor was associated with John de Beauchamp a relative of the Earl of Warwick. Around 1319 and through connections between the de Beauchamp family it became connected to one of the estates held by the Bassetts in Marsworth. By 1379 the manor had passed to Edward or Edmund Cook who gave it up to pay off debts.

The Penyston family held the manor from the beginning of the 15th century and it stayed with the family for 150 years until when Thomas Penyston died it passed to Thomas Tasburgh in 1572, who would later become MP for the county of Buckingham. His wife Dorothy acquired some notoriety for her gerrymandering of elections at Aylesbury. By 1650 and following several conveyances between the Dell, Blackwell and Wright families, the manor was in the hands of John Seare. From the beginning of the 18th century his son Richard owned jointly the manors of Hawridge and Cholesbury – an arrangement which has continued until today. The manorial rights were acquired by Robert Dayrell in 1748 and remained in the control of absentee landlords until the end of the 19th century. Henry Turner, a J.P. was the first Lord of the Manor to reside in the locality for 300 years when in 1899 he took up residency at Braziers End House in Cholesbury. A tradition continued since by the seven Lords of the Manor in the 20th/21st centuries

The Manorial Court which had ceased to operate during the early 19th century as the Church Vestry and later parish meetings held greater sway, was revived by Henry Turner. Held quarterly at the Full Moon, there are records of frequent fines for such misdeeds as turning out animals on the Common or removing from it wood or stone without permission. The manorial rights originating from the 12th century, which have continued to be held jointly with Cholesbury since 17th century no longer control village life. Hawridge and Cholesbury Commons Preservation Society now manage the Commons on behalf of the Lord of the Manor.

==Local economy==
Like the neighbouring village of Cholesbury, Hawridge with its extensive commons was on an important droving route. There were once several alehouses located close to the Common. They were able to flourish due to this boost in trade between the 18th and later on when up until the early part of the 20th centuries they were also frequented by the growing numbers of brickyard and agricultural labourers. The Full Moon Pub, which is closest to the parish boundary with Cholesbury, is recorded as having its first licensed keeper in 1766 although as an unlicensed alehouse it may date back to 1693. Further along the Common is the Rose and Crown, first licensed in 1753. Down Hawridge Vale is the oldest of the three, the Black Horse, which first opened in the mid-17th century. Other alehouses such as the Mermaid, across the road from the &#x27;Moon&#x27;, came and went but these three have survived to the present day.

The poor quality of the land though meant that employment for villagers was often of a casual nature. Straw plaiting was the chief occupation of women and children during most of the 19th century. The plait was sent to Luton or London. The availability of daily train services to London also provided income from pheasant rearing. Until the Second World War agriculture had been the principle industry in the area. During the 20th century, much of the land was gradually taken out of agricultural use until today when only a minimal acreage is given over to or cattle and sheep-grazing or arable farming. The relative closeness to Chesham provided opportunity for work within, for example, one of the many mills or boot factories. The arrival of the railway to Chesham during the 1880s, the relative closeness to London and other conurbations and improvement to the road networks and public transport resulted in work being sought from further afield. The village supported a number of small shops until the 1960s when supermarkets and increased car ownership sealed their fate.

Although a few businesses such as an agricultural merchants, a blacksmith and the three pubs continuing to operate today, there are no longer employers of significant numbers of local people within the village itself. In contrast, the 2001 census indicated a further change in employment patterns with increasing numbers of remote workers in Hawridge.

==Demographics==
The census of 1801 records there were 121 inhabitants in 24 families living in 21 houses in Hawridge. According to the subsequent censuses the population grew rapidly between 1801 and 1861 when it was 276 and then fell back by 1901 to just 209. By 1931 it had again increased to 222.

As at 2001 93.5% of the local people were recorded as of White ethnic origin. Just under 80% declared they were Christians. Some 45% of people were in employment and 21%, a significantly higher proportion than elsewhere in the district, were self-employed and over 15% were retired which was slightly higher than in nearby areas.
==Education==
Children between the ages of 5 and 11 attend Hawridge and Cholesbury Church of England School. Today the catchment area covers the neighbouring villages of Bellingdon, Cholesbury, St Leonards and Buckland Common (the latter two since the close of the school at St Leonards).

The school was founded as a National School and opened in 1874 on land given by the Lord of the Manor. Before this the only education available was from the &#x27;straw-plait&#x27; school, which were a common feature of villages in this part of the Chilterns and were also mentioned in a Select Committee report of 1819. The original school house remained as an integral part of the modern school until 2010 when it was sold and is now a private house.

==Landmarks and buildings==

A stone obelisk on the boundary between Hawridge and Cholesbury was erected in 1898 to mark Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee the year before.

===Hawridge Mill===
Hawridge Mill also known as Cholesbury Mill, is a disused tower mill which straddles the boundary between Hawridge and Cholesbury villages. It is now a private residence but was until 1912 in operation and on the site of an earlier smock mill. Residents and visitors in the First World War period included a number of artists and celebrities, including Gilbert Cannan, Mark Gertler, Bertrand Russell, and the actress Doris Keane.

===Hawridge Court===
The present day Hawridge Court, a private property, contains the location of the original medieval manor house which was surrounded by a ringwork, now designated a Scheduled Monument. The ringwork was most likely constructed shortly after the Norman Conquest though some archaeological features point to it having a much earlier, prehistoric origin. It is oval in shape measuring 60×50 metres in diameter, is bounded by a rampart 16 metres wide and between two and five metres high and an external ditch which includes a deep moat for part of its circumference. A gap and causeway marks the probable original entrance. On the outside there is a moat, also dated to the medieval period, which almost surrounds the ramparts The original manor house, built by 1223, was replaced by an 18th-century Grade II listed, timber-framed farmhouse. All that remains of the original manor buildings is a granary (or possibly pigeon house) relocated inside the plot and converted into a timber and brick cottage during the Tudor period. Additional barns were constructed in the 18th century. Hawridge Court was occupied periodically by the Lord of the Manors of Hawridge and Cholesbury.

===Pumping Station===

The water-pumping station at Nut Hazel Cross was built in the 1950s to supply water from the aquifer to the growing population in the towns of Halton, Tring and Wendover. Despite enhanced levels of water extraction when groundwater levels remained high the road through The Vale to Chesham, which has always lacked effective drainage was frequently impassable in winter months, and remains prone to flooding today.

==Religion==
St Mary&#x27;s Church was first mentioned in 1227. During the 19th century it fell into disrepair and was rebuilt in 1856 by the church architect William White, using original flint-and-brick materials and in a style peculiar to the 1850s known as &#x27;constructional polychromy&#x27;. The church has retained its 13th century circular font. Oliver Cromwell ordered that church organs be removed in 1644. Churches relied on bands comprising local musicians to provide accompaniment until organs were reintroduced in the 19th century. An old bassoon made around 1800 and played at St Mary&#x27;s was found during refurbishment of the church and is now to be found in Buckinghamshire County Museum Aylesbury.

A Baptist church met in a building by Bowmore Farm, at Hawridge which was a branch of the General Baptist Church in Chesham., and later of Akeman Street Baptist Church in Tring. It was mentioned in the 1851 Ecclesiastical Census by closed by the end of the 1800s. The building no longer stands.

In 1876 a small congregation met in a cottage in the village. A Mission Hall was opened for them in 1879 with the help of Naphill Mission Hall and Hope Hall (now Kings Road Evangelical Church), Berkhamsted with the words &quot;The desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose&quot; (Isaiah). It closed in 1989 and today the Hall is a private house.

==Transport==

Almost 95% of local residents have access to a car. Over the years the provision of buses has decreased significantly. Today a bus service runs once each way on alternative days connecting to Chesham, Tring and local villages. School buses are a valuable facility transporting children to Secondary Schools in Chesham and Amersham.

==Sport and recreation==
The local area with its open views, rural lanes, commons and woodland, criss-crossed by footpaths and bridleways consequently are very popular with cyclists, walkers and horse-riders. The churches of Hawridge and Cholesbury jointly hold a Summer Fête on August Bank Holiday, alternatively on Hawridge and Cholesbury Commons. The Kimblewick Hunt (previously known as Vale of Aylesbury with Garth &amp; South Berks Hunt) traditionally hold a meet on Boxing Day (26 December) which draws a large crowd from the local district. Quoits was played on the Commons up until the 1920s and the Full Moon pub had a Bowling Alley until the 1970s.

==Governance==
Hawridge together with the neighbouring villages of Cholesbury, St Leonards and Buckland Common are locally known as the Hilltop Villages. From 1896 the church vestry has been succeeded by the parochial church council focussing on church affairs and its responsibilities for the administration of village matters progressively ceded to Hawridge parish council. Hawridge remained a separate parish until 1 April 1934 when it came together with the other villages to form the civil parish of Cholesbury cum St Leonards and became part of Amersham Rural District which as part of the 1974 Local Government reorganisation was succeeded by Chiltern district. In 2021 Chiltern was abolished and Hawridge became part of Buckinghamshire unitary district.

<doc id="412621" wikidata="Q7411950" url="?curid=412621" title="Samuel L. Lewis">
<text>Samuel L. Lewis also known as Murshid Samuel Lewis and Sufi Ahmed Murad Chisti (October 18, 1896 January 15, 1971) was an American mystic and horticultural scientist who founded what became the Sufi Ruhaniat International, a branch of the Chishtia Sufi lineage. After a lifetime of spiritual study with teachers East and West, primarily Inayat Khan and Nyogen Senzaki, Lewis was recognized simultaneously as a Zen master and Sufi murshid (senior teacher) by Eastern representatives of the two traditions. He also co-founded the Christian mystical order called the Holy Order of Mans. His early interest in international seed exchange and organic agriculture also established him as one of the pioneers of green spirituality. His most enduring legacy may be the creation of the Dances of Universal Peace, an early interspiritual practice that has spread around the world in the 50 years since his death.

==Life==
Lewis was born to Jewish parents. Lewis&#x27; father Jacob Lewis was a vice president of the Levi Strauss jeans manufacturing company. His mother was Harriett Rosenthal, the daughter of Lenore Rothschild of the international banking family. Lewis showed a keen interest in religion and spirituality at an early age and, to his parents&#x27; dismay, he later rejected their encouragements to become a businessman.

In 1919 Lewis entered a Sufi community in Fairfax, California where he met Murshida Rabia Martin, a student of the Sufi teacher and musician Inayat Khan. A year later he began Zen study with Nyogen Senzaki, a disciple of the Rinzai Zen Buddhist Abbot Soyen Shaku. The practices and tenets of both Sufism and Zen continued to influence him throughout his life.

Lewis remained in the Fairfax Sufi community through the early 1920s. In 1923 a vision of Inayat Khan led Lewis into initiation by the Pir-O-Murshid. In 1926, he collaborated with Nyogen Senzaki, a Rinzai Zen Buddhist monk, in opening the first official Zen meditation hall (zendo) in San Francisco.

Lewis continued to study Sufism and Zen, as well as yoga, the latter with Swami Ramdas of Anandashram. He also developed an interest in horticulture and promoted seed exchanges internationally. Additionally, Lewis was an adherent and promoter of the General Semantics approach to psychology, language, and translation begun by Alfred Korzybski.

In 1956, he visited Japan, India, Pakistan, and Egypt, seeking the company of other mystics and teachers. In 1960–62, while visiting Pakistan, he reported that he was publicly recognized as a Murshid by Pir Barkat Ali, founder of Dar ul Ehsan. In 1966, after further Zen study with, among others, Sokei-An Sasaki and Sagaku Shaku, Lewis was ordained a &quot;Zen-Shi&quot; (Zen Master) by Korean Zen master Dr. Kyung-Bo Seo.

In 1967, whilst recovering from a heart attack in a hospital Lewis reported that he heard the voice of God say, &quot;I make you spiritual leader of the hippies.&quot;

For the remainder of his life, Lewis traveled California, developing and teaching new forms of walking meditation as well as the Dances of Universal Peace, which draw on concepts from the many spiritual traditions he had encountered. Lewis&#x27; work in the Dances of Universal Peace was also inspired by his time with American dance pioneer Ruth St. Denis, whom he acknowledged as their &quot;grandmother.&quot; In 1982, the organization now known as the International Network for the Dances of Universal Peace was founded by Saadi Neil Douglas-Klotz and Tasnim Hermila Fernandez for the purpose of promoting Lewis&#x27; vision of the Dances as a form of &quot;peace through the arts.&quot; The organization subsequently published many of St Denis&#x27; previously unpublished writings on spiritual dance and the mysticism of the body.

In the late 1960s, Lewis began initiating and training students under the banner of Zen, and then later of Sufism. Just before his death in 1971, Lewis formed an esoteric organization now known as the Sufi Ruhaniat International to help carry on his Sufi initiatic lineage in the Chishti Sufi tradition. Lewis died in January 1971 as a result of a fall one month earlier. Before his death he appointed as his successor Khalif Moineddin Jablonski, who directed the organization from 1971 until his own death in 2001. Jablonski was succeeded by Shabda Kahn as Pir of the lineage.

==Dargah==
When Samuel Lewis died, he asked that his body be buried at the interspiritual community of Lama Foundation, near Taos, New Mexico. The grave (called a &quot;maqbara&quot; in the Sufi tradition) became a pilgrimage site and was rebuilt several times in the intervening years. In August 2017, work was completed on a new building, called a &quot;dargah,&quot; surrounding the gravesite. It is designed to facilitate visits by pilgrims in the same way that Sufi dargahs in other parts of the world do.

==Quotations==
:&quot;No mechanical means, no rules, no rituals, nothing controlled by man alone can liberate man&quot;

:&quot;The Sufi dervishes, using their feet...rid their minds of useless luggage. The ridding of luggage is more important than the method. What is needed is a method that works, not a philosophy about method which can be very confusing.&quot;

:&quot;Words are not peace. Thoughts are not peace. Plans are not peace. Programs are not peace. Peace is fundamental to all faiths. Peace is fullness, all inclusive...and must be experienced.&quot;

:&quot;One of the reasons I am teaching this music and dancing is to increase Joy, not awe towards another person, but bliss in our own self. This is finding God within, through experience.&quot;

<doc id="412624" wikidata="Q72534237" url="?curid=412624" title="Helen Steel">
<text>Helen Steel (born 1965) is an environmental and social justice activist
who is known for her involvement in the McLibel case, an English lawsuit for libel filed by McDonald&#x27;s Corporation that lasted for 10 years and was eventually taken to the European Court of Human Rights, where Steel and fellow campaigner David Morris won their case against the UK Government on the grounds that they had been denied a fair trial. She is a key figure in the &#x27;Spycops&#x27; scandal and subsequent Undercover Policing Inquiry.

==McLibel case==

In 1986, as a member of the London Greenpeace environmental campaign group, Steel and other campaigners, including under cover policeman Bob Lambert produced and distributed a pamphlet entitled &quot;What&#x27;s wrong with McDonald&#x27;s - everything they don&#x27;t want you to know&quot;, accusing the fast food chain of mistreating animals and underpaying its employees. In 1990 McDonald&#x27;s served libel writs against five members of the group. Three members apologised, but Steel and David Morris refused to do so. At the time, Steel was working part-time at a bar, earning up to £65 a week, meaning that she and Morris (an unemployed postal worker) could not afford legal representation, and had to represent themselves in court, with occasional pro bono assistance from barrister Keir Starmer. The trial started in June 1994 at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, after a failed attempt to demand legal aid. Steel herself gave evidence (along with 59 defence witnesses), but in June 1997 the trial ended in defeat with Mr Justice Bell ordering the pair to pay £60,000 in damages to McDonald&#x27;s, which was reduced to £40,000 on appeal. It was the longest trial in English legal history.

The pair refused to pay the compensation, although McDonald&#x27;s never sought to collect it. They later took the UK Government to the European Court of Human Rights, stating that their lack of legal aid constituted a violation of their right to a fair trial, under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The court found in favour of the pair, forcing the Government to consider legal reforms.

Documents from the case showed that McDonald&#x27;s private investigators had been receiving information from the Metropolitan Police. The Metropolitan Police were sued over this, which was settled out of court and with an apology and an undertaking not to share information from police computers with corporations.

==Undercover policing==
Steel is a core participant in the Undercover Policing Inquiry. She is one of several women who were deceived into long-term relationships with undercover police officers, but is one of only two who have spoken publicly about their ordeal while using their own name.

Steel was a victim of the UK Spycops
scandal, deceived into a long term relationship with police officer, John Dines, (known to Steel as John Barker) who was working undercover, as part of a wider police operation, to gain information on campaigners involved in the organisation London Greenpeace.
Steel met Dines in the late 1980s, and in 1990 began a relationship with him, which lasted two years. They lived together, and had discussed starting a family together.
After two years Dines disappeared abroad, claiming to have had a breakdown. Steel has said she spent years searching for him, and it was during this time that she discovered he had been using a false identity (that of a dead child). She tracked him down and confronted him in 2016, when he then apologised to her.

Steel is one of seven women who were apologised to by the Metropolitan Police for their deception
and one of eight women to bring a legal action against the police for the abuses entailed by their undercover police operations.

<text>Hedgerley is a village and civil parish in South Bucks district in Buckinghamshire, England. The parish is centred south-east of Beaconsfield and south-west of Gerrards Cross. The parish has incorporated the formerly separate parish of Hedgerley Dean since 1934 (which was once a hamlet in parish of Farnham Royal).

The toponym name &quot;Hedgerley&quot; is derived from the Old English meaning &quot;Hycga&#x27;s woodland clearing&quot;. In manorial rolls in 1195 it was recorded as &quot;Huggeleg&quot;.

==Architecture and geography==
Situated in the foothills of the Chiltern Hills, Hedgerley is a linear layout of red-brick and timber-framed cottages, amongst which Victoria Cottages date from the 16th century. It is bounded to the north by the M40 motorway.

The old Quaker House on the northern edge of the village dates from 1487.

The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary the Virgin was designed by the Gothic Revival architect Benjamin Ferrey and built in 1852. The Tudor Revival Rectory was built in 1846.

==In film, fiction and the media==
The 1953 British film Genevieve was shot on roads around Pinewood Studios and the couples stop for a “hair of the dog” at the old (now demolished) One Pin pub with Genevieve seen driving down Hedgerley Hill as well as actors John Gregson and Dinah Sheridan filmed in Collinswood Road.

Scenes from Lionel Jeffries&#x27; 1972 family film &quot;The Amazing Mr Blunden&quot; were filmed in the village and at the church.

The village including the fields and woods of the parish featured in the episode &quot;Secrets &amp; Spies&quot; of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;.

==Demography==
The village&#x27;s most notable resident was the infamous Judge Jeffreys (1645–89).

A few fields in the parish are called the sea fields as in spring they become full with bluebells.

<doc id="412627" wikidata="Q1059963" url="?curid=412627" title="Challenge–response authentication">
<text>In computer security, challenge-response authentication is a family of protocols in which one party presents a question (&quot;challenge&quot;) and another party must provide a valid answer (&quot;response&quot;) to be authenticated.

The simplest example of a challenge-response protocol is password authentication, where the challenge is asking for the password and the valid response is the correct password.

An adversary who can eavesdrop on a password authentication can authenticate themselves by reusing the intercepted password. One solution is to issue multiple passwords, each of them marked with an identifier. The verifier can then present an identifier, and the prover must respond with the correct password for that identifier. Assuming that the passwords are chosen independently, an adversary who intercepts one challenge-response message pair has no clues to help with a different challenge at a different time.

For example, when other communications security methods are unavailable, the U.S. military uses the AKAC-1553 TRIAD numeral cipher to authenticate and encrypt some communications. TRIAD includes a list of three-letter challenge codes, which the verifier is supposed to choose randomly from, and random three-letter responses to them. For added security, each set of codes is only valid for a particular time period which is ordinarily 24 hours.

Another basic challenge-response technique works as follows. Bob is controlling access to some resource, and Alice is seeking entry. Bob issues the challenge &quot;52w72y&quot;. Alice must respond with the one string of characters which &quot;fits&quot; the challenge Bob issued. The &quot;fit&quot; is determined by an algorithm defined in advance, and known by both Bob and Alice. The correct response might be as simple as &quot;63x83z&quot;, with the algorithm changing each character of the challenge using a Caesar cipher. In reality, the algorithm would be much more complex. Bob issues a different challenge each time, and thus knowing a previous correct response (even if it is not obfuscated by the means of communication) does not allow an adversary to determine the current correct response.

==Other non-cryptographic protocols==
Challenge-response protocols are also used in non-cryptographic applications. CAPTCHAs, for example, are meant to allow websites and applications to determine whether an interaction was performed by a genuine user rather than a web scraper or bot. In early CAPTCHAs, the challenge sent to the user was a distorted image of some text, and the user responded by transcribing the text. The distortion was designed to make automated optical character recognition (OCR) difficult and prevent a computer program from passing as a human.

==Cryptographic techniques==
Non-cryptographic authentication was generally adequate in the days before the Internet, when the user could be sure that the system asking for the password was really the system they were trying to access, and that nobody was likely to be eavesdropping on the communication channel. To address the insecure channel problem, a more sophisticated approach is necessary. Many cryptographic solutions involve &quot;two-way authentication;&quot; both the user and the system must verify that they know the shared secret (the password), without the secret ever being transmitted in the clear over the communication channel.

One way this is done involves using the password as the encryption key to transmit some randomly generated information as the &quot;challenge&quot;, whereupon the other end must return as its &quot;response&quot; a similarly encrypted value which is some predetermined function of the originally offered information, thus proving that it was able to decrypt the challenge. For instance, in Kerberos, the challenge is an encrypted integer &quot;N&quot;, while the response is the encrypted integer &quot;N + 1&quot;, proving that the other end was able to decrypt the integer &quot;N&quot;. A hash function can also be applied to a password and a random challenge value to create a response value. Another variation uses a probabilistic model to provide randomized challenges conditioned on model input.

Such encrypted or hashed exchanges do not directly reveal the password to an eavesdropper. However, they may supply enough information to allow an eavesdropper to deduce what the password is, using a dictionary attack or brute-force attack. The use of information which is randomly generated on each exchange (and where the response is different from the challenge) guards against the possibility of a replay attack, where a malicious intermediary simply records the exchanged data and retransmits it at a later time to fool one end into thinking it has authenticated a new connection attempt from the other.

Authentication protocols usually employ a cryptographic nonce as the challenge to ensure that every challenge-response sequence is unique. This protects against Eavesdropping with a subsequent replay attack. If it is impractical to implement a true nonce, a strong cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator and cryptographic hash function can generate challenges that are highly unlikely to occur more than once. It is sometimes important not to use time-based nonces, as these can weaken servers in different time zones and servers with inaccurate clocks. It can also be important to use time-based nonces and synchronized clocks if the application is vulnerable to a delayed message attack. This attack occurs where an attacker copies a transmission whilst blocking it from reaching the destination, allowing them to replay the captured transmission after a delay of their choosing. This is easily accomplished on wireless channels. The time-based nonce can be used to limit the attacker to resending the message but restricted by an expiry time of perhaps less than one second, likely having no effect upon the application and so mitigating the attack.

Mutual authentication is performed using a challenge-response handshake in both directions; the server ensures that the client knows the secret, and the client &quot;also&quot; ensures that the server knows the secret, which protects against a rogue server impersonating the real server.

Challenge-response authentication can help solve the problem of exchanging session keys for encryption. Using a key derivation function, the challenge value and the secret may be combined to generate an unpredictable encryption key for the session. This is particularly effective against a man-in-the-middle attack, because the attacker will not be able to derive the session key from the challenge without knowing the secret, and therefore will not be able to decrypt the data stream.

==Simple example mutual authentication sequence==
*Server sends a unique challenge value sc to the client
*Client sends a unique challenge value cc to the server
*Server computes sr = hash(cc + secret) and sends to the client
*Client computes cr = hash(sc + secret) and sends to the server
*Server calculates the expected value of cr and ensures the client responded correctly
*Client calculates the expected value of sr and ensures the server responded correctly
where
*sc is the server-generated challenge
*cc is the client-generated challenge
*cr is the client response
*sr is the server response
This particular example is vulnerable to a reflection attack.

==Password storage==
To avoid storage of passwords, some operating systems (e.g. Unix-type) store a hash of the password rather than storing the password itself. During authentication, the system need only verify that the hash of the password entered matches the hash stored in the password database. This makes it more difficult for an intruder to get the passwords, since the password itself is not stored, and it is very difficult to determine a password that matches a given hash. However, this presents a problem for many (but not all) challenge-response algorithms, which require both the client and the server to have a shared secret. Since the password itself is not stored, a challenge-response algorithm will usually have to use the hash of the password as the secret instead of the password itself. In this case, an intruder can use the actual hash, rather than the password, which makes the stored hashes just as sensitive as the actual passwords. SCRAM is a challenge-response algorithm that avoids this problem.

==Examples==
Examples of more sophisticated challenge-response algorithms are:
* Zero-knowledge password proof and key agreement systems (such as Secure Remote Password (SRP))
* Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) ()
* CRAM-MD5, OCRA: OATH Challenge-Response Algorithm ()
* Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) ()
* ssh&#x27;s challenge-response system based on RSA.

Some people consider a CAPTCHA a kind of challenge-response authentication that blocks spambots.

<doc id="412629" wikidata="Q3374308" url="?curid=412629" title="Capital punishment by the United States federal government">
<text>Capital punishment is a legal punishment under the criminal justice system of the United States federal government. It is the most serious punishment that could be imposed under federal law. The serious crimes that warrant this punishment include treason, espionage, murder, large-scale drug trafficking, or attempted murder of a witness, juror, or court officer in certain cases.

The federal government imposes and carries out a small minority of the death sentences in the U.S., with the vast majority being applied by state governments. The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) manages the housing and execution of federal death row prisoners.

In practice, the federal government rarely carries out executions. As a result of the Supreme Court opinion in &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; in 1972, the federal death penalty was suspended from law until its reinstatement by Congress in 1988. No federal executions occurred between 1972 and 2001. From 2001 to 2003, three people were executed by the federal government. 

No further federal executions occurred from March 18, 2003, up to July 14, 2020, when they resumed under President Donald Trump, during which 13 death row inmates were executed in the last 6 months of his first presidency. 

Since January 16, 2021, no further executions have been performed. On July 1, 2021, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland placed a moratorium on all federal executions pending review of policy and procedures. On February 5, 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi lifted the moratorium and directed the Justice Department to take steps to strengthen the death penalty, consistent with an executive order signed by the newly re-inaugurated President Trump on January 20.

There are 3 offenders remaining on federal death row, after outgoing President Joe Biden issued a blanket commutation of death row prisoners not convicted of terrorism or hate-motivated mass murder. Two death row inmates, Shannon Agofsky and Len Davis, have asked a U.S. district court to reject their commutations because they believe that being commuted would hinder their efforts to prove their innocence. It is not yet known whether or not the inmates will have their commutations rejected, though the Justice Department and DPIC director Robin Maher have argued that the President&#x27;s commutation power is absolute, thus preventing rejection of commutations. 

The exceptions are Dylann Roof, Robert Gregory Bowers, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. 

==History==
The Crimes Act of 1790 defined some capital offenses: treason, murder, robbery, piracy, mutiny, hostility against the United States, counterfeiting, and aiding the escape of a capital prisoner. The first federal execution was that of Thomas Bird on June 25, 1790, for committing &quot;murder on the high seas&quot;, after he murdered his captain while serving on a slave ship.

The use of the death penalty in U.S. territories was handled by federal judges and the U.S. Marshal Service.

Historically, members of the U.S. Marshals Service conducted all federal executions. Pre-&quot;Furman&quot; executions by the federal government were normally carried out within the prison system of the state in which the crime was committed. Only in cases where the crime was committed in a territory, the District of Columbia, or a state without the death penalty was it the norm for the court to designate the state in which the death penalty would be carried out, as the federal prison system did not have an execution facility.

The last pre-&quot;Furman&quot; federal execution took place on March 15, 1963, when Victor Feguer was executed for kidnapping and murder, after President John F. Kennedy denied clemency.

Capital punishment was halted in 1972 after the &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; decision but was once again permitted under the &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot; decision in 1976.

In the late 1980s, Senator Alfonse D&#x27;Amato, from New York State, sponsored a bill to make certain federal drug crimes eligible for the death penalty as he was frustrated by the lack of a death penalty in his home state. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 restored the death penalty under federal law for drug offenses and some types of murder. President Bill Clinton signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, expanding the federal death penalty in 1994. In response to the Oklahoma City bombing, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 was passed in 1996. Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute became the only federal prison to execute people and one of only three prisons to hold federally condemned people.

The federal death penalty applies even in areas without a state death penalty since federal criminal law is the same for the entire country and is enforced by federal courts, rather than by state courts. From 1988 to October 2019, federal juries gave death sentences to eight convicts in places without a state death penalty when the crime was committed and tried.

The federal death penalty is also applicable for any crime involving the murder of a United States national outside of the United States, if the crime is intended to, as per 18 USC 2332, &quot;coerce, intimidate, or retaliate against a government or a civilian population.&quot;

Timothy McVeigh was executed on June 11, 2001, for his involvement in the Oklahoma City bombing, where 168 people were killed. The first federal execution since 1963, it was broadcast on a closed circuit-television to survivors and victims&#x27; families.

===Since 2019===
On July 25, 2019, U.S. Attorney General William Barr announced that the federal government would resume executions using pentobarbital, rather than the three-drug cocktail previously used. The Bureau of Prisons&#x27; acting director then scheduled 5 convicted death row inmates to be executed in December 2019 and January 2020. However, on November 20, 2019, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan issued a preliminary injunction preventing the resumption of federal executions, because the plaintiffs in the case argued that the use of pentobarbital alone violated the Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994. The injunction was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and, on December 6, 2019, by the United States Supreme Court, but it told the court of appeals to rule on the case &quot;with appropriate dispatch&quot;. Justices Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh wrote that they believed the government would ultimately win the case and that they would have set a 60-day deadline for the court of appeals to finalize it. In January 2020, the Justice Department argued to the appeals court that when Congress declared that federal executions must be carried out &quot;in the manner prescribed by the state&quot; where inmates were convicted, it was referring to the general method of execution allowed in states, such as lethal injection, rather than the specific drugs to be used.

In July 2020, the first federal execution under the presidency of Donald Trump was carried out, the first after a 17-year hiatus. Overall, thirteen federal prisoners were executed between July 2020 and January 2021, including Lisa Montgomery, the first woman executed by the federal government in 67 years.

President Trump oversaw more federal executions than any president in the preceding 120 years.

The Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was sentenced to death on June 24, 2015, for his role in the terrorist attack of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, but that sentence was vacated by a federal appeals court on July 31, 2020. Following a Supreme Court decision, the sentence was reinstated on March 4, 2022.

Most of the federal death row inmates are imprisoned at United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute (USP Terre Haute) in Terre Haute, Indiana. , due to security concerns, death row inmate Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is held at the United States Penitentiary Florence Administrative Maximum Facility (ADX Florence) in Florence, Colorado. Federal Medical Center, Carswell (FMC Carswell), located at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth just west of Fort Worth, Texas, has previously housed women who were on federal death row. Forty people have had their sentences commuted to life in prison: one by President Bill Clinton in 2001, two in 2017 by President Barack Obama, who commuted one death sentence handed down by a federal district court and another issued by a court-martial and 37 by President Joe Biden in December 2024.

Democrats repeatedly introduce the Federal Death Penalty Abolition Act.

== Post- Gregg executions ==
=== Demographics ===
==Legal process==
===Sentencing===
In the federal system, the final decision to seek the death penalty rests with the United States Attorney General. This differs from most states, where local prosecutors have the final say with no involvement from the state attorney general.

The sentence is decided by the jury and must be unanimous. Sentences of death handed down by a jury cannot be rejected by the judge. In case of a hung jury during the penalty phase of the trial, a life sentence is issued, even if a single juror opposed death (there is no retrial).

===Appeals and clemency===
While death row inmates sentenced by state governments may appeal to both state courts and federal courts, federal death row inmates have to appeal directly to federal courts.

The power of clemency and pardon belongs to the President of the United States.

==Method==
The method of execution of federal prisoners for offenses under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is that of the state in which the conviction took place. If the state has no death penalty, the judge must select a state with the death penalty for carrying out the execution.

The federal government has a facility and regulations only for executions by lethal injection, but the United States Code allows U.S. Marshals to use state facilities and employees for federal executions.

Federal executions typically occur at the United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, in Terre Haute, Indiana. The method of execution used at USP Terre Haute is lethal injection.

Pre-&quot;Furman&quot; federal executions were often conducted by hanging or electrocution, and less commonly by cyanide gas.

==Presidential assassins==

Four Presidents of the United States have been slain by assassins while in office. The assassins of Abraham Lincoln were tried by a military commission based on the military nature of the conspiracy. Charles Guiteau&#x27;s trial was held in a civilian court of the District of Columbia where the assassination of James Garfield happened.

The assassin of William McKinley, Leon Czolgosz, was tried and executed for murder by New York state authorities. The accused assassin of John F. Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald, would presumably have been tried for murder by Texas state authorities had he not been killed two days later by Jack Ruby in the basement of the Dallas Municipal Building (then Dallas Police Department headquarters) while being transferred to the county jail. (Ruby himself was initially tried and convicted of murder in a Texas state court, but that was overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and he died before he could be retried.) Only after Kennedy&#x27;s death was it made a federal crime to murder the President of the United States.

==Military executions==

The United States military has executed 135 people since 1916. The most recent person to be executed by the military is U.S. Army Private John A. Bennett, executed on April 13, 1961, for child rape and attempted murder. Since the end of the Civil War in 1865, only one person has been executed for a purely military offense: Private Eddie Slovik, who was executed on January 31, 1945, after being convicted of desertion.

For offenses related to their service, members of the military are usually tried in courts-martial that apply the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and may order the death penalty as a possible sentence for some crimes. Military commissions may also be established in the field in time of war to expeditiously try and sentence enemy military personnel under the UCMJ for certain offenses. Controversially, the Military Commissions Act of 2009 allows military commissions to try and sentence alien unprivileged enemy belligerent[s] accused of having engaged in or purposefully and materially support[ed] hostilities against the United States or its allies, without the benefit of some UCMJ protections. In a military commission trial, the death penalty may only be imposed in case of a unanimous verdict and sentencing decision.

<text>Michael J. Rogers (born June 2, 1963) is an American law enforcement officer and politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 2001 to 2015. A member of the Republican Party, he chaired the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence from 2011 to 2015.

After retiring from the U.S. House, Rogers was hired by CNN as a national security commentator. He was also executive producer for the CNN program &quot;Declassified: Untold Stories of American Spies&quot;. Rogers was the Republican nominee in the 2024 United States Senate election in Michigan, narrowly losing to Democratic nominee Elissa Slotkin.

==Early life and career==
Rogers was born in Livonia, Michigan, the son of Joyce A. and John C. Rogers. He graduated from Adrian College in 1985, from which he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in criminal justice and sociology. Rogers served in the United States Army from 1985 to 1989. Rogers is on Telefonica&#x27;s Technical and Security Advisory Committee and a board member of IP3 International.

===Law enforcement career===
Rogers worked as a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in its Chicago office, specializing in organized crime and public corruption from 1989 to 1994. He is a member of the Society of Former Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 2017, Rogers was interviewed to be the new director of the FBI after James Comey was dismissed.

==Michigan State Senate==

Rogers was first elected in 1994. In 1998, he won a second term with 68% of the vote. He represented three counties: Clinton, Livingston, and Shiawassee. He served as majority leader from 1999 to 2000. Rogers wrote legislation creating the Michigan Education Savings Program.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
Rogers was elected as a Republican from the 8th district of Michigan to the United States House of Representatives in one of the nation&#x27;s closest congressional races of 2000. He defeated Democratic State Senator Dianne Byrum by 111 votes to win the district 8 seat left open by Debbie Stabenow. However, the district was redrawn to be much friendlier to Republicans in the 2002 round of redistricting. It lost its share of heavily Democratic Genesee County while being pushed further east into the solidly Republican northern portion of Oakland County and also gaining Republican-leaning Clinton County, north of Lansing.

===Tenure===
Rogers&#x27;s measure to make education savings plans free of federal taxes was adopted in 2003 (see Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001). His health savings account program for low-income families who are covered by Medicaid was signed into law on February 8, 2008. Rogers was the primary sponsor of the Respect for America&#x27;s Fallen Heroes Act, H.R. bill 5037, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush on May 29, 2006. The CBO has said that Rogers&#x27;s H.R. 1206 to make it easier for states to obtain waivers from some Medical Loss Ratio requirements would add $1.1 billion to the deficit between 2013 and 2022.

On November 30, 2011, Rogers introduced the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA). Rogers introduced and supported the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015 (H.R. 4681; 113th Congress), a bill that would authorize a variety of intelligence agencies and their appropriations for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. In March 2014, Rogers announced he would not seek an 8th term in Congress. He later launched &quot;Something to Think About&quot;, a daily radio segment. Former Michigan State Senator Mike Bishop won the Republican primary and defeated Democratic challenger Eric Schertzing.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Energy and Commerce
** Subcommittee on Communications and Technology
** Subcommittee on Health
* Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (Chairman)
** As chair of the full committee, he may serve as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of all subcommittees.

== U.S. Senate candidacy ==
In August 2023, Rogers announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate to succeed the retiring Democrat Debbie Stabenow. He won the Republican primary with over 60% of the vote on August 6, 2024, and was the Republican nominee in the general election against Democrat Elissa Slotkin. He was narrowly defeated in the November election by fewer than 20,000 votes.

==Personal life==
Rogers has been married to his second wife, Kristi Rogers, since 2010. He has two children from his first marriage. Rogers&#x27;s older brother, Bill, was a state representative in Michigan.

Rogers sits on the Atlantic Council&#x27;s Board of Directors. He is also the David M. Abshire Chair at the Center for the Study of the Presidency &amp; Congress, an Intelligence Project Senior Fellow at Harvard University&#x27;s Belfer Center, a member of George Mason University&#x27;s National Security Institute Board of Advisors, and the chair of the board of trustees for the Mitre Corporation.

<text>Edward Vivian &quot;Vance&quot; Palmer (28 August 1885 – 15 July 1959) was an Australian novelist, dramatist, essayist and critic.

==Early life==
Vance Palmer was born in Bundaberg, Queensland, on 28 August 1885 and attended the Ipswich Grammar School. With no university in Queensland, he studied contemporary Australian writing at the intellectual hub in Brisbane at the time, the School of Arts, following the work of A. G. Stephens. Working in various jobs, he took a position as a tutor at Abbieglassie cattle station, west of Brisbane in the &#x27;back of beyond&#x27;. He also worked as a manager: at that time there was a large Aboriginal population with whom he both worked and celebrated, attending their frequent corroborrees. It was here his love of the land and environmental awareness was honed, so too his interest in white-black relationships. From his early years he was determined to be a writer, and in 1905 and again in 1910 he went to London, then the centre of Australia&#x27;s cultural universe, to learn his craft and advance his prospects. He was acknowledged as an expert on foreign affairs – in Mexico and Ireland. His association with Alfred Orage and his work for &quot;The New Age&quot; and other guild socialists greatly influenced his political outlook.

Palmer met his future wife, Janet (Nettie) Higgins, in Melbourne in 1909. They were married in London in 1914 and were on holiday in France when World War I broke out. They went back to London where their elder daughter Aileen was born in 1915. Later that year, they returned to Australia and settled in Melbourne. Their second daughter, Helen, was born there in 1917. Vance and Nettie campaigned against the Hughes government&#x27;s attempt to introduce conscription into Australia. In 1918, Palmer enlisted in the First Australian Imperial Force and was sent back to Europe, but the war ended before he saw service. He was discharged from the army late in 1919.

==Writing career and later life==
Both Vance and Nettie had begun to publish poetry, short stories, criticism and journalism before the war, but in the 1920s, living in the fishing village of Caloundra, Queensland, to save money, they dedicated themselves to literature full-time. Palmer published his first novel in 1920, and a well-received play, &quot;The Black Horse&quot;, in 1924. His best novels of this period were &quot;The Man Hamilton&quot; (1928), &quot;Men Are Human&quot; (1930), &quot;The Passage&quot; (1930) and &quot;The Swayne Family&quot; (1934).

During World War II Vance and Nettie were strongly opposed to the advent of fascism, whether in Australia or overseas. Because they had witnessed the loss of democratic rights during the Great War their work was to strengthen the Australian belief in egalitarianism. Palmer published a series of historical and biographical works: &quot;National Portraits&quot; (1941), &quot;A G Stephens: His Life and Work&quot; (1941), &quot;Frank Wilmot&quot; (1942) and &quot;Louis Esson and the Australian Theatre&quot; (1948).

In the postwar years Palmer wrote a trilogy – &quot;Golconda&quot; (1948), &quot;Seedtime&quot; (1957) and &quot;The Big Fellow&quot; (1959), based loosely on the life of the Queensland politician Ted Theodore. The trilogy met a poor critical reception. While today his novels are out of print, many of his short stories are still read and reissued. &quot;The Big Fellow&quot; won him a posthumous Miles Franklin Award.

In 1954 Palmer published &quot;The Legend of the Nineties&quot;, a critical study of the development of the nationalist tradition in Australian literature usually associated with &quot;The Bulletin&quot;. This is perhaps his best-remembered work.

Vance and Nettie were remembered by those who knew them for their great compassion and generosity. They were instrumental in the recognition of Australian literature as a subject worthy of serious study and teaching in the academy. During the last decades of his life Vance is remembered for his regular radio broadcasts on books and writing. Vance and Nettie&#x27;s last years were clouded by their own ill health and by worry about their daughter Aileen, who suffered a mental breakdown in 1948 and became an alcoholic. A member of the advisory board for the early Australia Council Palmer was attacked as a Communist &quot;fellow traveler&quot; (which to some extent he was) during the McCarthyist period of the 1950s, but his integrity was recognised by the deeply conservative Prime Minister of that era, Sir Robert Menzies. Vance died from heart disease in 1959.

The Victorian Premier&#x27;s Literary Award for fiction is named the Vance Palmer Prize, while the prize for non-fiction is the Nettie Palmer Prize (until 2010 when under the stewardship of the Wheeler Centre they were renamed as Victorian Premier&#x27;s Prizes).

<doc id="412635" wikidata="Q19118258" url="?curid=412635" title="Nettie Palmer">
<text>Janet Gertrude &quot;Nettie&quot; Palmer (née Higgins) (18 August 1885 – 19 October 1964) was an Australian poet, essayist and Australia&#x27;s leading literary critic of her day. She corresponded with women writers and collated the &quot;Centenary Gift Book&quot; which gathered together writing by Victorian women.

==Early life==
Nettie Higgins was born in Bendigo, Victoria, the niece of both H.B. Higgins, a leading Victorian radical political figure and later a federal minister and justice of the High Court of Australia, and of H.B. Higgins&#x27; sister, Ina Higgins, the first female landscape architect in Victoria. A brilliant scholar and linguist, Nettie was educated at the Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College, Melbourne, the University of Melbourne and studied phonetics in Germany and France for the International Diploma of Phonetics. She was active in literary and socialist circles on her return to Melbourne and formed a deep and long term relationship with the visionary poet Bernard O&#x27;Dowd. While her brother Esmonde Higgins was a prominent early Australian Communist, Nettie never joined any political party: she was much more interested in broad social change.
Higgins met Vance Palmer in the Public Library in Melbourne in 1909. Over the next few years, both spent time in Europe: Higgins studying for her diploma, Palmer establishing a career in journalism and writing in London. He was active in circles associated with early modernism and &quot;The New Age&quot;. They married in London in April 1914, intending to work there for a couple of years, but after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, militarism dominated journalism. A daughter, Aileen, was born in London in April 1915. The Palmers returned to Melbourne later that year. Another daughter, Helen, was born in May 1917. Vance and Nettie campaigned against the Hughes government&#x27;s attempt to introduce conscription into Australia. In 1918, Vance volunteered to join the Australian Army, but the war ended before he saw active service.

==Writing career==
Both Vance and Nettie had begun to publish poetry, short stories, criticism and journalism before the war. Before her marriage Nettie taught modern languages and phonetics. In the 1920s, living in the seaside township of Caloundra, Queensland, Nettie, like Vance, could dedicate herself to literature and writing full-time.

In 1924 Nettie published &quot;Modern Australian Fiction&quot;, at that time the most important critical study of Australian literature. With her two daughters then attending school she returned to writing full-time. Writing regularly for numerous newspapers all round Australia, she wrote on a wide range of topics, from environment to cultural events, reviewing all important books being published in Australia, America, Europe and elsewhere. 1928 saw the publication of her short story selection, &quot;An Australian Story-Book&quot;, drawing on short stories which had only found form in ephemeral publications. In 1931 she published an important biography of her uncle, &quot;Henry Bournes Higgins: A Memoir&quot;. She edited an extraordinary collection of writings by Victorian women, both historical and literary for the centenary of Victoria, &quot;Centenary Gift Book&quot;. She also became the centre of a network of correspondence with many other writers, mainly women. She was an important confidante and mentor for such writers as Marjorie Barnard and Flora Eldershaw.

In 1935 the Palmers traveled to Europe, and they were holidaying near Barcelona when the Spanish Civil War broke out. Aileen and Helen had both joined the Communist Party as students, and Aileen stayed behind to volunteer for service with the British Medical Unit in Spain when the rest of the family returned to Australia. On their return to Melbourne Nettie devoted herself to supporting the Spanish Republic.

During World War II Vance and Nettie were strongly opposed to the advent of fascism, whether in Australia or overseas. Because they had witnessed the loss of democratic rights during the Great War their work was to strengthen the Australian belief in egalitarianism and human rights. They were also early advocates for the importance of regional environmental awareness and Nettie&#x27;s book on the Dandenongs is an important early environmental history. Nettie published &quot;The Memoirs of Alice Henry&quot; (1944) and &quot;Fourteen Years: Extracts from a Private Journal&quot; (1948), often considered her best work.

Nettie published &quot;Henry Handel Richardson: a Study&quot;, which did a great deal to establish the reputation of now-acclaimed Melbourne author Henry Handel Richardson (the pen name of Ethel Florence Lindesay Richardson) and her monumental trilogy &quot;The Fortunes of Richard Mahony&quot;.

==Legacy==
Vance and Nettie were remembered by those who knew them for their great compassion and generosity. They were instrumental in the recognition of Australian literature as a subject worthy of serious study and teaching in the academy. Nettie was active in the Goethe Institute in Melbourne. 

==Last years and death==
Vance and Nettie&#x27;s last years were clouded by their own ill health and by worry about their daughter Aileen, who suffered a mental breakdown in 1948 and became an alcoholic. Aileen was an established poet in her own right and wrote extensively on the Spanish Civil War. Nettie died in 1964, universally mourned by Australian writers and readers.

==Palmer awards==
The Victorian Premier&#x27;s Literary Award for fiction is named the Vance Palmer Prize, while the prize for non-fiction is the Nettie Palmer Prize (until 2010 when under the stewardship of the Wheeler Centre they were renamed as Victorian Premier&#x27;s Prizes). In 2018, Nettie was inducted into the Hall of Fame for the Melbourne Press Club in recognition of her elegant prose.

<doc id="412637" wikidata="Q1424581" url="?curid=412637" title="Biak Archipelago">
<text>The Biak Islands (, also Schouten Islands or Geelvink Islands) are an island group of Papua province, eastern Indonesia in the Cenderawasih Bay (or Geelvink Bay) 50 km off the north-western coast of the island of New Guinea. The group consists of the main islands of Biak, Supiori and Numfor, and numerous smaller islands, mostly covered in rain forest. The population of the archipelago is about 130,000.

==History==

The first recorded sighting by Europeans of the Schouten Islands was by the Portuguese navigator Jorge de Menezes in 1526. On the voyage from Malacca to Maluku, via northern Borneo, he was further carried eastward by a storm and strong winds. Jorge de Menezes landed at Biak, where he was forced to winter. Inspired by Malay, Moluccan or local Papuan names, he named the archipelago, and eventually the coasts of western Papua &quot;Islands of Papuas&quot;. Biak was thenceforth called in Portuguese maps or , and .
The archipelago was also sighted by Spanish navigator Álvaro de Saavedra who landed on Yapen on June 24, 1528, when trying to return from Tidore to New Spain. The islands were named (Golden Islands in Spanish). In 1545 they were visited by Íñigo Órtiz de Retes on board the galleon &quot;San Juan&quot;.
The archipelago was first mapped in the Portuguese charts of Gaspar Viegas (c. 1537), an anonymous map of 1540, and on the maps of João de Lisboa and of Bartolomeu Velho (c. 1560), and by other Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch maps.

The Schouten Islands were eventually named after Dutch explorer Willem Schouten, who explored them in 1615. 

The Tidore Sultanate had tributary ties with the islands. Seafarers from the region used to regularly pay homage to the sultan.

==Demographics==
The Biak Islands are among the most densely populated parts of Papua province.

==Ecology==
===Terrestrial===
These small islands have been designated the Biak–Numfoor rain forests. They have the most highly endemic avifauna of any single area in the New Guinea region. The forest consists of similar types of trees to that on mainland New Guinea.

There are over 100 bird species on the islands, of which 11 to 16 are endemic, that is, restricted to this small island group. These include: black-winged lory (&quot;Eos cyanogenia&quot;); the small tree-climbing Geelvink pygmy parrot (&quot;Micropsitta geelvinkiana&quot;); Biak scrubfowl (&quot;Megapodius geelvinkianus&quot;); Geelvink imperial pigeon (&quot;Ducula geelvinkiana&quot;); Geelvink fruit dove (&quot;Ptilinopus speciosus&quot;); Biak coucal (&quot;Centropus chalybeus&quot;); two tree kingfishers, Biak paradise kingfisher (&quot;Tanysiptera riedelii&quot;) and Numfor paradise kingfisher (&quot;Tanysiptera carolinae&quot;); Biak gerygone (&quot;Gerygone hypoxantha&quot;); Biak monarch (&quot;Monarcha brehmii&quot;); Biak flycatcher (&quot;Myiagra atra&quot;); long-tailed starling (&quot;Aplonis magna&quot;); and Biak white-eye (&quot;Zosterops mysorensis&quot;). 

As well as the birds, there are a number of endemic mammals, although there are only 29 mammal species on the islands. The endemics include: Biak naked-backed fruit bat (&quot;Dobsonia emersaa&quot;) a species of barebacked fruit bat (so-called because their wings are attached to the back rather than the sides, giving this type of bat a different appearance to most species; a marsupial Biak glider (&quot;Petaurus biacensis&quot;); Japen rat (&quot;Rattus jobiensis&quot;); and two species of giant naked-tailed rat, &quot;Uromys boeadii&quot; and &quot;Uromys emmae&quot;.

The islands also have a number of endemic butterflies and one endemic spider &quot;Diolenius angustipes&quot;.

Much of the forest has been cut down for logging or to clear land for planting especially on Biak Island, which is the most populous in the area, although logging has slowed. There are two protected areas, which are close to each other: Pulau Supiori Nature Reserve, which is most of Supiori Island; and Biak Utara Nature Reserve which is an area on Biak Island just across the bridge from Supiori. However the logging industry may return, while birds are vulnerable to collectors and just because they have such a limited range of habitat on these small islands. The area needs more study. 

===Marine===

The seas around the Biak Islands are part of the Coral Triangle, a marine region which has the world&#x27;s greatest diversity of coral reef species. Diving in the waters off Biak is a popular activity for tourists.

The islands have two marine protected areas. The Biak Numfor Locally Managed Marine Area, established in 2015, protects Numfor&#x27;s eastern coast and the southern coast of Biak. Padaido Marine Recreation Park, established in 2009, protects the waters around the Padaido Archipelago, a group of small islands lying south and southeast of Biak.

<text>Hedsor is a small village and civil parish in Wycombe district in Buckinghamshire, England, in the very south of the county, near the River Thames and Bourne End. It is in the civil parish of Wooburn.

The village toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;Hædde&#x27;s cliff&quot;, referring to the position of the village on a cliff overlooking the Thames.

Hedsor House was the ancient seat of the de Hedsor family, who took their name from the village. They owned it at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086. The modern manor house was built in 1778, and stands on a hill in the village with a commanding view of the Thames and of Berkshire.

In 1583 Rowland Hynd built a new Tudor manor house at Hedsor which was badly damaged by fire in 1795 and eventually demolished in 1865. At about this time the fourth Lord Boston commissioned the architect James Knowles to design a new house at Hedsor.

Hedsor House remained as the Boston family&#x27;s country house until early in the 20th century, during which time Queen Victoria was said to be a frequent visitor to the house and its beautiful surrounding parkland.

Rowland Hynd had the Church of England parish church of Saint Nicholas &quot;re-edified&quot; in 1608.

<doc id="412640" wikidata="Q2654713" url="?curid=412640" title="Hillesden">
<text>Hillesden is a village and civil parish in north-west Buckinghamshire, England, about south of Buckingham.

The village name is Anglo-Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;Hild&#x27;s hill&#x27;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was recorded as &quot;Ilesdone&quot;, though earlier it had been referred to as &quot;Hildesdun&quot;.

Hillesden is split up into three areas; Church End, The Orchard and The Barracks. Church End is situated at the top of the hill and surrounds the church. The Orchard consists of Orchard Cottages and Orchard View, whilst The Barracks are situated across from Great Ground.
The 15th century parish church in Hillesden is dedicated to All Saints and is a grade I listed building. The tithes of the church were anciently collected by Christ Church, Oxford. The Irish judge Godfrey Boate, subject of a famous mocking elegy by Jonathan Swift, is buried here (he had married into the Dentons, the local landowning family).

Hillesden was the home of the Denton family. During the English Civil War the manor house at Hillesden, was owned by Sir Alexander Denton, Member of Parliament for Buckingham. Denton was a Royalist and his house at Hillesden became a focal point in the conflict. In January 1644 Parliamentary forces occupied Hillesden House but they were ejected. In early February Colonel William Smith garrisoned Hillesden House with about 260 men to support the King at Oxford. The house was occupied by many of the Denton family and some of the Verney family and Sir Alexander also arrived at the house by chance. A force of over 2000 men under Oliver Cromwell and Samuel Luke laid siege to the house at the beginning of March. After the surrender Smith and Denton were taken prisoner and moved to the Tower of London, while the house was destroyed and the family beggared. Denton died a prisoner on New Years Day 1645. The medieval church, built in 1493 was saved from the ravages of war, however, and remains to this day along with Parliamentary bullet holes in its door.

<doc id="412643" wikidata="Q862472" url="?curid=412643" title="Male lactation">
<text>Production of milk (lactation) from a male mammal&#x27;s mammary glands is well-documented in the dayak fruit bat and the Bismarck masked flying fox. The term &quot;male lactation&quot; is not used in human medicine. It has been used in popular literature, such as Louise Erdrich&#x27;s &quot;The Antelope Wife&quot;, to describe the phenomenon of male galactorrhea, which is a human condition unrelated to childbirth or nursing. Newborn babies of both sexes can occasionally produce milk. This is called neonatal milk (also as &quot;witch&#x27;s milk&quot;) and not considered male lactation. 

==History==
Male lactation was of some interest to Alexander von Humboldt, who reports in &quot;Voyage aux régions équinoxiales du Nouveau Continent&quot; about a citizen of the Venezuelan village of Arenas (close to Cumana) who allegedly nurtured his son for three months when his wife was ill, as well as Charles Darwin, who commented on it in &quot;The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex&quot; (1871):

Darwin later considered the nearly perfect function of male nipples in contrast to greatly reduced structures such as the vesicula prostatica, speculating that both sexes may have nursed young in early mammalian ancestors, and subsequently mammals evolved to inactivate them in males at an early age.

==Evolution and biology==
Male mammals of many species have been observed to lactate under unusual or pathogenic conditions, such as extreme stress, castration, and exposure to phytoestrogens, or pituitary tumors. Therefore, it is hypothesized that while most male mammals could easily develop the ability to lactate, there is no selective advantage to male lactation. While male mammals could, in theory, improve their offspring&#x27;s survival rate through the additional nourishment provided by lactation, most have developed other strategies to increase the number of surviving offspring, such as mating with additional partners. Presently, very few species are known where male lactation occurs and it is not well understood what evolutionary factors control the development of this trait.

==Nonhuman animal male lactation==
The phenomenon of male lactation occurs in some species, notably the dayak fruit bat (&quot;Dyacopterus spadiceus&quot;), lesser short-nosed fruit bat (&quot;Cynopterus brachyotis&quot;), and the Bismarck masked flying fox (&quot;Pteropus capistratus&quot;). Lactating males may assist in the nursing of their infants. In addition, male goats are known to lactate on occasion.

==Human male lactation==
Spontaneous production of milk not associated with childbirth, known as galactorrhea, can occur in human males and females. Case reports of lactation induced in transgender women have been published.

<doc id="412645" wikidata="Q2576428" url="?curid=412645" title="East Texas">
<text>East Texas is a broadly defined cultural, geographic, and ecological region in the eastern part of the U.S. state of Texas that comprises most of 41 counties. It is primarily divided into Northeast and Southeast Texas. Most of the region consists of the Piney Woods ecoregion. East Texas can sometimes be defined only as the Piney Woods. At the fringes, towards Central Texas, the forests expand outward toward sparser trees and eventually into open plains.

According to the &quot;Handbook of Texas&quot;, the East Texas area &quot;may be separated from the rest of Texas roughly by a line extending from the Red River in north-central Lamar County southwestward to east-central Limestone County and then southeastward towards eastern Galveston Bay&quot;. Most sources separate the Gulf Coast area into a separate region.

Another popular, somewhat simpler, definition defines East Texas as the region between the Trinity River, north and east of Houston (or sometimes Interstate 45, when defining generously) as the western border; the Louisiana border as the eastern border; the Gulf of Mexico as the southern border; the Oklahoma border as the northern border; Arkansas as the northeastern border, and extending as far south as Orange, Texas.

The East Texas region includes Kilgore, Tyler, Longview, Texarkana, Lufkin, Marshall, Palestine, Henderson, Jacksonville, Mount Pleasant, and Nacogdoches as principal cities in addition to, in its expanded definition, Greenville, Houston, and Beaumont metropolitan statistical areas.
== Geography ==
Climate is the unifying factor in the region&#x27;s geography; all of East Texas has the humid subtropical climate typical of the Southeast, occasionally interrupted by intrusions of cold air from the north. East Texas receives more rainfall, , than the rest of Texas. In Houston, the average January temperature is and the average July temperature is . However, Houston has slightly warmer winters than most of East Texas due to its lower latitude and proximity to the coast.

All of East Texas lies within the Gulf Coastal Plain. It has less uniformity of climate than the rolling hills in the north and flat coastal plains in the south. Local vegetation varies from north to south, with the lower third consisting of the temperate grassland extending from South Texas to South Louisiana and the northern two-thirds of the region dominated by the temperate forest known as the Piney Woods. These extend more than . The Piney Woods are part of a much larger region of pine-hardwood forest that extends into Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. The Piney Woods area thins out as it nears the Gulf of Mexico. West of the Piney Woods are the ranchlands and remnant oak forests of the East Central Texas forests ecoregion.

The Sabine, Trinity, Neches, Angelina and Sulphur rivers are the major rivers in East Texas, but the Brazos and Red rivers also flow through the region. The Brazos cuts through the southwest portion of the region, while the Red River forms its northern border with Oklahoma and a portion of Arkansas. In East Texas and the rest of the South, small rivers and creeks collect into swamps called bayous and merge with the surrounding forest. Bald cypress and Spanish moss are the dominant plants in bayous. The most famous of these bayous are Cypress Bayou and Buffalo Bayou. Cypress Bayou surrounds the Big, Little, and Black Cypress rivers around Jefferson. They flow east into Caddo Lake, and the adjoining wetlands cover the rim and islands of the lake.

=== Deep East Texas ===
Deep East Texas is a subregion of East Texas, alongside Northeast and Southeast Texas. According to the Deep East Texas Council of Governments, the region consists of the following twelve counties: Angelina, Houston, Jasper, Nacogdoches, Newton, Polk, Sabine, San Augustine, San Jacinto, Shelby, Trinity, and Tyler.

The &quot;Deep&quot; designation comes from the similarity to East Texas (it is similar in culture and topography, being highly forested), but with a location &quot;deeper&quot; (i.e., farther south and towards the Gulf Coast) than the rest of East Texas.

&quot;Deep&quot; also refers to the cultural and social characteristics of the area. This is considered synonymous to the &quot;Big Thicket&quot;, an allusion to the dense growth of underbrush in the Piney Woods. It was the earliest area of Texas to be settled by Anglo-Americans from the United States (and one of the last areas to submit to law enforcement—by the governments of New Spain, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, the state of Texas, or the United States). Well into the first quarter of the 20th century, renegade clans controlled local governments, especially in Shelby County.

The area contains two of the oldest towns in Texas; Nacogdoches, the oldest town in Texas, dating from the 18th century, and San Augustine, the oldest &quot;British-American&quot; settlement in Texas, dating from the 1820s. People of English, Scottish, Scots-Irish, and to a lesser extent Welsh ancestry predominate in this region, because of the history of settlement. This is in contrast to West Texas and South Central Texas, where people of Hispanic and German ancestry predominate, respectively. Hispanic settlers are descended from colonists of New Spain, dating from the 16th and 17th centuries. Most of the German immigrant ancestors in Central Texas arrived after the Revolutions of 1848.

The Spanish and later Mexican governments did not want settlers from the United States until after Mexico had gained independence. East Texas had been barely settled by Spanish and Mexican colonists, and the government decided to allow immigration from the US to bolster defenses against raiding by the Apache and Comanche. Neither government was able to exert much control or law enforcement in the area. As a consequence, the &quot;Big Thicket&quot; became a refuge for criminals fleeing the United States and hiding out in a &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot; in the pine tree thickets.

=== The Pine Curtain ===
The early isolation of the region and its links to the Deep South have resulted in the piney woods being described as a &#x27;curtain&#x27; that demarcates a certain cultural enclave or bubble that distinguishes East Texas from the rest of the state. Former residents describe living behind the &#x27;Pine Curtain&#x27; as a form of escape. The phrase is often used to describe the area; it appeared in a newspaper column in the &quot;Palestine Herald-Press&quot;, and in a late 20th-century tourist guide by Mike Dougan.

East Texas comprises 41 counties, 38 of which collaborate in sub-regional Ark-Tex Council of Governments, the East Texas Council of Governments, the Deep East Texas Council of Governments, and the South East Texas Regional Planning Commission.

Counties generally included are Anderson, Angelina, Bowie, Camp, Cass, Cherokee, Delta, Franklin, Gregg, Hardin, Harrison, Henderson, Hopkins, Houston, Jasper, Jefferson, Lamar, Marion, Morris, Nacogdoches, Newton, Orange, Panola, Polk, Rains, Red River, Rusk, Sabine, San Augustine, San Jacinto, Shelby, Smith, Titus, Trinity, Tyler, Upshur, Van Zandt, and Wood County, Texas. Harris County and those forming the Greater Houston metropolitan area are sometimes included in varying sources, such as the Texas Department of Transportation, or more generally, Southeast Texas.

The three additional East Texas counties that join with other regional government councils are Chambers County (Anahuac), Liberty County (Liberty), and Walker County (Huntsville), all three in geographic proximity to the Houston metropolitan area.

Outside of the Greater Houston area, the average population density is around 18–45 per mi2 (7–12 per km2), with the population density near the Big Thicket dropping below 18 people per mi2. East Texas&#x27;s population total is very large and is centered around the Golden Triangle (Texas) of Beaumont/Port Arthur/Orange in Southeast Texas. Moving north from the coast, Lufkin and Nacogdoches anchor the population center of Deep East Texas. Continuing north from Deep East Texas, Tyler, Longview, and Marshall, in Northeast Texas, along with Texarkana, on the far northeastern border with Arkansas, represent the major population centers in the northern section of East Texas. Eight miles from the Texas border, Shreveport, Louisiana, is considered the economic and cultural center for the Ark-La-Tex, the area where Arkansas, Louisiana, and East Texas meet.

According to the 2010 U.S. census, these 41 East Texas counties had a total population of 2,057,518 residents. This represented 8% of the total state population of Texas.

Per the 2023 census estimates, the five most populous counties were:
# Jefferson County (251,496)
# Smith County (245,209)
# Gregg County (126,243)
# Bowie County (91,687)
# Angelina County (87,319)

Per the 2022 census estimates, the ten most populous East Texas cities outside of Houston&#x27;s metro area were:
# Beaumont (112,089)
# Tyler (109,286)
# Longview (82,531)
# Port Arthur (55,479)
# Huntsville (47,351) (Huntsville, Walker County, Texas is not of the above 41 listed counties of East Texas.)
# Texarkana (35,778) (TX side only, 65,084 when combined with Texarkana, AR)
# Lufkin (34,152)
# Nacogdoches (31,990)
# Paris (24,695)
# Marshall (23,641)
In 2010, the population of East Texas counties was 65.93% non-Hispanic white, 17.44% African American, 14.29% Hispanic or Latino American, and 2.34% other (including Native American and Asian). East Texas&#x27;s most ethnically and racially diverse county was Jefferson County, its largest county. This includes the city of Beaumont, with 44.1% non-Hispanic whites, 34.1% African Americans, 17.7% Hispanic or Latinos of any race, and 4.1% other races or ethnicities (including Native American and Asian).

East Texas is within the Black Belt region, the fertile area that was the center of cotton culture and enslaved African-American labor. East Texas has the largest Black population in the state.

Unlike Texas&#x27;s total state racial demographics, only two counties in East Texas outside of Greater Houston&#x27;s sphere had a majority minority. Jefferson County in the Golden Triangle and Titus County have a 40.6% Hispanic or Latino population. East Texas and Southeast Texas in particular, which had been areas of cotton plantation before the Civil War, have a significant African-American population, ranging to nearly 20% in some counties.

== Culture ==
East Texas is often considered the westernmost extension of the Deep South. The predominant cultural influence comes from customs and traditions passed down from European American and African American Southerners who settled the region during the mid-to-late 19th century. African Americans were first brought to the area as enslaved workers to develop and cultivate commodity crops on plantations. Harrison County had the most plantations and highest number of slaves in the antebellum period. Deep South accent influences are noticeable in the subdialect of Texan English that is spoken throughout the region. According to the most recent linguistic studies, East Texans tend to pronounce Southern English with the drawl typical of the Lower South. Other parts of Texas are more apt to use the &quot;twang&quot; of the Upper South, or—depending upon demographic influences of the particular area—with some Hispanic and Midwestern traits.

East Texas lacks the strong influence of late 19th-and early 20th-century European immigrants from Germany and central Europe. Similarly, the new waves of immigrants since the late 20th century, primarily from India, other Asian nations, and Latin America, and their influences, have been less prevalent in East Texas compared to other Texas regions.

East Texans are predominantly Protestant Christians. They are members of many denominations as part of the Bible Belt. The most numerous Christian adherents have included the Baptists, particularly the Southern Baptist Convention (majority white) and National Baptist Convention USA (majority black, formed after the Civil War); Methodists and Presbyterians; Lutherans and classical Pentecostals; and others.

Roman Catholicism continues to have influence, particularly given the increased Hispanic or Latino American population in recent decades. The largest Catholic jurisdictions in the region has been the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston in Southeast Texas, and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tyler in the northeastern subregion.

Other religious faiths with smaller numbers, but with adherents in East Texas, include Mormonism and Judaism.

Significant numbers of people of Cajun and Creole descent have migrated from Louisiana, although most are assimilated partially or completely into East Texas culture (adopting the local culture, and losing to varying degrees, their original culture). This assimilation pattern has often historically included conversion from Roman Catholicism, associated with French and Spanish traditions, to Protestant denominations.

United States settlers from the Protestant Southeast practiced some discrimination against Cajun and Creole migrants, a cultural attitude that persisted until quite recently. Despite the tendency toward assimilation, Cajun and Creole cuisine (for example, jambalaya and catfish gumbo), are popular in the region. Many East Texans, including those without Louisiana roots, are known to be expert at preparing at least some well-known Louisiana dishes.

While some East Texans associate with cowboy culture, most identify more with smaller scale farming of the Southern U.S., than with the expansive cattle ranching of the plains regions of Texas. But East Texans commonly own and trade cattle. Several &quot;sale barns&quot; exist across East Texas, with weekly and monthly trades, as is common in other parts of the Deep South.

In the northern part of East Texas, awareness of the native and historical Caddo Mississippian culture remains significant. Cherokee County is home to the Caddo Mounds State Historic Site. Patrons can also view the &quot;Caddo Indian Collection&quot; at the Gregg County Historical Museum in Longview. In the mid-1800s, East Texas cities such as Marshall and Jefferson constituted a sphere of influence that led the entire state into the Confederacy. East Texas was the aread of powerful planters and the most significant numbers of slaveholders.

Before that, during the Mexican and Republic periods, Nacogdoches and San Augustine were the most developed and influential cities in East Texas. Many East Texans have a mixture of European and Native American ancestry, as seen in East Texan country artists Miranda Lambert and Kacey Musgraves. The Museum of East Texas opened in Lufkin in 1976 under the name Lufkin Historical and Creative Arts Center.

=== Music ===

East Texas is home to the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame, located in Carthage. East Texans enjoy a range of music that is influenced by gospel, bluegrass, blues, rock, country, soul, rhythm and blues, Cajun, etc. Texas blues originated in East Texas, with many legends having been born in the region, including Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins and T-Bone Walker. East Texans enjoy live music at many of the region&#x27;s fairs and festivals, including the Texas Rose Festival in Tyler, the East Texas Yamboree in Gilmer, and Longview&#x27;s Great Texas Balloon Race.

East Texas also has many venues included in what is commonly referred to as the Texas country music circuit, although the majority of such venues are located in Central/South/West Texas and the metropolitan areas of the state.

Many notable music artists have East Texas roots, including: George Jones (Saratoga), Miranda Lambert (Lindale), Kacey Musgraves (Mineola), Jamie Foxx, (Terrell), Neal McCoy (Longview and Jacksonville), Lee Ann Womack (Jacksonville), Janis Joplin (Port Arthur), UGK (Port Arthur), Don Henley (Linden), Ray Price (Perryville), Johnny Horton (Rusk), Johnny Mathis (Gilmer), Tex Ritter (Panola County), Jim Reeves (Panola County), Mark Chesnutt (Beaumont), Tracy Byrd (Vidor), Clay Walker (Beaumont), T-Bone Walker (Linden), Chris Tomlin (Grand Saline), and Michelle Shocked (Gilmer), among many others.

Worldwide-acclaimed pianist Van Cliburn, a native of nearby Shreveport, Louisiana, was raised in Kilgore. Kilgore College houses the Van Cliburn Auditorium on its home campus.

Many high-school bands in East Texas continue the tradition of military-style marching, unlike other parts of the state. These bands compete in the National Association Of Military Marching Bands.

=== Sports and outdoors ===
As with other parts of Texas, high school football is the most popular local sport venue in East Texas. Residents of East Texas towns and rural communities fill high-school stadiums in support of their local teams, cheerleaders, bands, etc. Many East Texas high-school teams have won Texas state championships, along with producing many collegiate and professional football players.

Earl Campbell, the &quot;Tyler Rose&quot;, played football for John Tyler High in Tyler before playing for the Texas Longhorns and the Houston Oilers. Don Meredith, who famously played for the Dallas Cowboys, played at Mt. Vernon. Dez Bryant, a football player from Lufkin, formerly played wide receiver for the Dallas Cowboys before signing with the New Orleans Saints (then getting injured three days afterwards). Adrian Peterson, a star running back for the Minnesota Vikings, played high-school football in Palestine. Many other high-school sports are popular in East Texas, including basketball, baseball, volleyball, softball, and track.

A significant number of East Texan youths participate in Little League Baseball, soccer, and softball. Church leagues are quite common in providing opportunities for basketball and softball for youth and adults alike. In recent years, cowboy churches have grown in number and offer rodeo events for their youth.

East Texans also enjoy collegiate athletic competition. Most residents support collegiate teams located in other regions of the state; the Texas A&amp;M Aggies, Texas Longhorns, Texas Tech Red Raiders, Baylor Bears, TCU Horned Frogs, etc. Including the city of Houston, its Houston Cougars are another prominent collegiate team. Due to proximity to neighboring states, East Texas has a substantial number of fans of the LSU Tigers, Arkansas Razorbacks, Oklahoma State Cowboys, and Oklahoma Sooners. The Battle of the Piney Woods has historically been a fiercely contested sports rivalry between the Bearkats of Sam Houston State University in Huntsville and the Lumberjacks of Stephen F. Austin State University (SFA) in Nacogdoches. Both schools long competed as members of the NCAA Division I Southland Conference (SLC), which plays football at the FCS level, but they moved to the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) in 2021, and Sam Houston will move to FBS and join Conference USA in July 2023. The Cardinals of Lamar University in Beaumont left the SLC for the WAC alongside Sam Houston and SFA, but rejoined the SLC a year later. The Lions of Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce joined the SLC in 2022.

Other universities and colleges that field athletic teams in East Texas include East Texas Baptist University Tigers in Marshall; University of Texas at Tyler Patriots in Tyler; LeTourneau University Yellowjackets in Longview; and several junior colleges throughout the region, which participate in the Southwest Junior College Conference in Region XIV of the NJCAA. East Texas is also home to the Kilgore College Rangerettes, a world-famous dance team that debuted in 1939.

A few professional sports teams are located in the traditionally defined East Texas. The East Texas Pump Jacks, located in Kilgore, play baseball in the Texas Collegiate League. Additionally, the East Texas Storm, a semiprofessional football team located in Tyler, competes in the Lone Star Minor League. Typically, northern parts of East Texas tend to support the professional teams from the Dallas/Fort Worth area in North Texas (Dallas Cowboys, Dallas Mavericks, Texas Rangers, Dallas Stars, FC Dallas), while southern parts of East Texas tend to support professional teams from the Houston area in Southeast Texas (Houston Texans, Houston Rockets, Houston Astros, Houston Dynamo FC).

As with other parts of Texas and/or the Southern U.S., other popular sporting activities in East Texas include rodeo (including PRCA), hunting, and fishing. Prominent rodeos in East Texas are held in Beaumont, Nacogdoches, Paris, Longview, Gladewater, Huntsville, Lufkin, Athens, Palestine, Lindale, etc. East Texas contains several award-winning lakes for sport fishing, including Toledo Bend Reservoir, Lake Sam Rayburn, Lake Livingston, Lake Fork Reservoir, Lake Tawakoni, etc.

East Texas also contains numerous golf courses and avid golfers, as well as NASCAR fans. However, the region does not host professional events in either of those sports. The nearest NASCAR track to East Texas is Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth.

East Texans enjoy many Texas state parks, including Caddo Lake, Atlanta, Daingerfield, Lake Bob Sandlin, Tyler, Mission Tejas in Grapeland, Cooper Lake, Lake Tawakoni, Martin Creek, Huntsville, Lake Sam Rayburn, Lake Livingston and Sea Rim among others. East Texas is also home to the Angelina National Forest, Davy Crockett National Forest, Sam Houston National Forest, Sabine National Forest, Big Thicket National Preserve, Trinity River National Wildlife Refuge, Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge, and McFaddin National Wildlife Refuge.

== Economy ==
=== Industry ===
Historically, the East Texas economy has been led by lumber, cotton, cattle, and oil. Prior to the discovery of the East Texas Oil Field, cotton, lumber and cattle were the predominant source of economic growth and stability. The needs of local farmers contributed greatly to the establishment of local towns and trading posts. As with many parts of the nation, the chosen paths of railroads often determined the continuation of many towns. At the beginning of the 20th century, the oil fields were discovered and oil became accessible, changing the future of the region.

In the decades leading to the new millennium, crude oil production in the East Texas Oil Field, the largest oil field in the United States, somewhat decreased. In turn, the number of high-paying jobs for uneducated workers also decreased. During the 20th century, local groceries, general stores, and cafes were replaced with franchise department stores, retail chains, and fast-food restaurants. Due to the decline of oil production, many small towns closed cafés and gas stations, some of which were replaced with cash loan shops and pawn shops. In 2022, East Texas was highlighted for its diversifying economy penetrating Deep East Texas with the decline in crude oil. Additionally, the region has become home to many patent-holding companies, due to its legal system being particularly friendly to patent holders and hostile to out-of-state tech defendants. In 2009, Paul Knight of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; stated in an article, &quot;some say natural gas has surpassed crude as king in East Texas.&quot;

Tourism has not been a highly significant source of economic activity in the majority of East Texas, although several high-traffic corridors pass through East Texas, which have aided economic development along those routes. These include: Interstate 30 (from Dallas through Texarkana), Interstate 20 (through Dallas and on through Shreveport), Interstate 10 (through Houston and Beaumont into Louisiana), Interstate 45 (through Houston up to Dallas), and U.S. Highway 59 (through Houston and north past Texarkana; in process of being upgraded along most of the route to Interstate 69).

=== Poverty ===
East Texas is one of the most economically disadvantaged regions in the state. In 2021 the poverty rate in the greater northeast Texas area (Anderson, Bowie, Camp, Cass, Cherokee, Delta, Franklin, Gregg, Harrison, Henderson, Hopkins, Lamar, Marion, Morris, Panola, Rains, Red River, Rusk, Smith, Titus, Upshur, Van Zandt, and Wood counties) was 16%, higher than both the state rate, 14.7%, and the national rate at 13.4%. In the same year 13.4% of households received Food Stamps or SNAP compared to 11.8% across Texas, and 11.7% nationwide. As of January 2022. The average wage in the region was also lower than the state and national average at $45,027, which were $62,289 and $64,555 respectively.

<text>Chauncey Mitchell Depew (April 23, 1834April 5, 1928) was an American attorney, businessman, and Republican politician. He is best remembered for his two terms as United States Senator from New York and for his work for Cornelius Vanderbilt, as an attorney and as president of the New York Central Railroad System.

==Early life==
Depew was born in Peekskill, New York, on April 23, 1834, to Isaac Depew (1800–1869) and Martha Minot (Mitchell) Depew (1810–1885).

===Family===
Depew&#x27;s father was a merchant and farmer who pioneered river transportation between Peekskill and New York and was descended from François DuPuy, a French Huguenot who purchased land from natives at the present site of Peekskill. Through his mother, Depew was descended from Rev. Josiah Sherman, who served as a chaplain with rank of captain in the Revolutionary War and who was the brother of American founding father Roger Sherman and Rev. Charles Chauncy, the second president of Harvard College.

===Education===
Depew attended Peekskill Military Academy for 12 years before matriculating at Yale College in 1852. At Yale, Depew joined many clubs and won several honors. He won second dispute appointments in his junior and senior years and was an honored speaker at Junior Exhibition and Commencement. He joined the Thulia Boat Club, Kappa Sigma Epsilon, Kappa Sigma Theta, Psi Upsilon, and Skull and Bones. He served as third president of the Linonian Society. At Yale, he was a classmate of two future United States Supreme Court Justices, David Josiah Brewer and Henry Billings Brown. He graduated in 1856.

==Legal and business career==
After graduating from Yale, Depew apprenticed in the office of Edward Wells in Peekskill and read law with William Nelson. He was admitted to the New York state bar in March 1858 and opened an office in Peekskill, where he practiced until 1861. For a few months, Depew engaged in the brokerage business in New York City as a member of the firm Depew &amp; Potter, but then resumed his law practice in Peekskill. Depew later moved to New York City. During the American Civil War, Depew served as Adjutant of the 18th Regiment of the New York National Guard, and later Colonel and Judge Advocate of the 5th Division on the staff of Major General James W. Husted of the New York Guard.

In 1865, Depew was appointed and confirmed to the position of United States Minister to Japan, but he declined the appointment to pursue his career as a railroad and business lawyer.

===Railroad attorney===
In 1866, Depew became the attorney for New York &amp; Harlem Railroad, owned by Cornelius Vanderbilt. Three years later, he took the same position for Vanderbilt&#x27;s New York Central and Hudson River Railroad. Having earned recognition for his work with subsidiary companies, Depew became general counsel and director of the entire &quot;Vanderbilt System&quot; in 1876. He joined the executive board of the New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad in 1882 and became its second vice president. In 1885, Depew was elected the railroad&#x27;s president and served in that capacity until 1898 when he was succeeded by Samuel R. Callaway. Depew then became chairman of board of directors of New York Central Railroad Company until his death in 1928.

While Depew was primarily active in the Vanderbilt railroads, he held concurrent positions with many other railroads and companies. He was president of West Shore Railroad and served on the boards of directors for the New York and Harlem Railroad, the Chicago and North Western Railway, the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway, the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad, the Delaware and Hudson Railroad, the New Jersey Junction Railroad, the St. Lawrence and Adirondack Railroad, the Wallkill Valley Railroad, and the Canada Southern Railroad.

Aside from railroads, Depew also served on the boards of directors for Western Union, the Hudson River Bridge Company, the Niagara River Bridge Company, the New York State Realty &amp; Terminal Company, the Union Trust Company, Equitable Life Assurance Company, and Kensico Cemetery Association.

==Political career==

As a young student and lawyer, Depew stumped the state of New York for John C. Frémont in 1856 and for Abraham Lincoln in 1860.

===New York politics===
Depew represented Westchester County in the New York State Assembly in 1862 and 1863. During the latter year, he sometimes acted as Speaker of the New York State Assembly pro tempore while Speaker Theophilus C. Callicot was under investigation. In 1863, he was elected Secretary of State of New York on the Union ticket and served from 1864 to 1865.

In 1867, Depew became clerk of Westchester County but resigned after a short service. In 1870, the New York Legislature named Depew Immigration Commissioner, but he declined to serve. Depew had also been commissioner of quarantine and president of Court of Claims of New York City as well as commissioner of taxes and assessments for the city and county of New York. Depew was one of the commissioners appointed to build the state capitol in 1874 and a member of the state&#x27;s boundary commission in 1875.

In 1872, Depew ran for Lieutenant Governor of New York on the Liberal Republican-Democratic ticket but was defeated.

In 1886, Depew gave an oration at the unveiling of the Statue of Liberty.

On October 7, 1897, Depew inaugurated the New York pneumatic tube mail, declaring: &quot;This is the age of speed. Everything that makes for speed contributes to happiness and is a distinct gain to civilization. We are ahead of the old countries in almost every respect, but we have been behind in methods of communication within our cities. In New York this condition of communication has hitherto been barbarous. If the Greater New York is to be a success, quick communication is absolutely necessary. I hope this system we have seen tried here to-day will soon be extended over all the Greater New York.&quot;

In 1898, Depew nominated Theodore Roosevelt for Governor of New York at the Republican state convention.

===Presidential politics===

Depew served as a delegate-at-large to each Republican National Convention from 1888 to 1904 and was elected delegate to all following conventions, including 1928, being elected the day before he died. At the convention in 1888, Depew received 99 votes for the presidential nomination. He made presidential nominating speeches for Benjamin Harrison in 1892 and Governor Levi Morton in 1896. In 1904, he made the re-nominating speech for Vice President Charles Fairbanks.

===U.S. Senate===
Depew was a candidate for United States Senator in an 1881 special election, but withdrew his name from consideration after the 41st ballot. He also declined nomination as a senator in 1885.

In 1899, Depew was elected to the Senate from New York and was re-elected in 1905. He served from March 4, 1899, to March 3, 1911.

In 1906, David Graham Phillips began a muckraking series entitled &quot;The Treason of the Senate&quot; for William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s new &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine, and targeted Depew in the first article. The article&#x27;s sensational charges included labeling Depew a &quot;boodler&quot; owned &quot;mentally and morally&quot; by railroad magnates Cornelius and William Vanderbilt. The piece provoked outrage from President Roosevelt, the &quot;New York Sun&quot; and Senator Henry Cabot Lodge.

==Death==
In spring 1928, Depew became ill while returning from Florida to Manhattan. He died of bronchial pneumonia in Manhattan on April 5, 1928. He was buried in the family mausoleum in Hillside Cemetery, Peekskill. In his honor, the huge concourse of Grand Central Terminal was draped in mourning.

==Personal life==

Depew married twice. On November 9, 1871, he married Elise Ann Hegeman (1848–93) in New York City. She was the daughter of William and Eliza Jane (Nevin) Hegeman. Before her death on May 7, 1893, they had one son, Chauncey Mitchell Depew Jr. (1879–1931), who died unmarried.

On December 27, 1901, he re-married to May Eugenie Palmer (1866–1940) in Nice, France. She was the daughter of Henry and Alice (Hermann) Palmer. In 1904, he was one of several high-profile investors who backed the Intercontinental Correspondence University, but the institution folded by 1915.

He attended Saint Thomas Episcopal Church in New York.

===Yale===
Depew was a member of the Yale Corporation (1888–1906). In 1887, Yale conferred him an honorary doctorate of letters. He was a founding member of the Yale Alumni Association of New York and served as its third president from 1883–92. He was also among those founding members of the Yale Club of New York City in 1897. He was a vice chairman of the $20,000,000 Yale Endowment Campaign and was elected an honorary member of Yale Class of 1889 in 1923. In his will, he left $1,000,000 to Yale without restrictions as to its use.

===Civic associations===
He served as trustee of his alma mater, the Peekskill Military Academy.

In 1877, Depew became a regent of the University of the State of New York and served until 1904.

Depew became a member of the New York Chamber of Commerce in 1885 and served as its vice president from 1904–08.

In 1918, Depew was made life member of Lawyers&#x27; Club of New York.

Depew was active in a number of patriotic and hereditary societies. He served as president of Empire State Society of the Sons of the American Revolution from 1890–99, the Pilgrims Society from 1918 until his death, and the Saint Nicholas Society. He joined the Union League in 1868 and served as its president for seven years. He was elected an honorary life member at the close of his presidency. He was also a member of the Connecticut Society of the Cincinnati, the New York Society of Colonial Wars, Holland Society, Huguenot Society and the New England Society of New York. Other cultural memberships included the Metropolitan Museum of Art, American Association for the Advancement of Science, France-America Society, New York Historical Society, Historical Society of St. Augustine, Florida, American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society, National Horse Show, Lafayette Post of the Grand Army of the Republic, and the citizens&#x27; committee to complete the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.

===Health===

Depew used to smoke 25 cigars a day but gave up smoking aged 65 upon the advice of his secretary. He gave up drinking alcohol at aged 88. Depew stated that he had worked &quot;practically every day&quot; of his life. He avoided stress and slept 7 and half hours a day. In 1908, it was widely reported in newspapers that Depew had become a vegetarian. In a 1925 interview aged 90, Depew clarified that he had never been a vegetarian but in his early 60s removed red meat from his diet but consumed poultry. He commented that &quot;Beefsteaks and roast butcher&#x27;s meat figured too much in my diet, I concluded. Out they went, never to return. I&#x27;m not a vegetarian; wouldn&#x27;t be one –that&#x27;s going to extremes– but I don&#x27;t eat need red meat and don&#x27;t eat it. For thirty years the only meat I&#x27;ve eaten has been poultry.&quot;

===Honors===
Depew received the French Légion d&#x27;honneur in the rank of Officer.

Depew was an honorary member of the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society.

In 1887, Depew became an honorary member of Columbia chapter of Phi Beta Kappa.

==Legacy==
Depew was a distinguished orator and after-dinner speaker and published many of those speeches. Recordings of his speeches were commercially issued as gramophone discs by Zonophone Records in the late 1890s. Depew was remembered as a prodigious speaker years after his death; many years after his death, Senator Robert S. Kerr of Oklahoma quoted Depew in an attack on a Senator from Indiana: &quot;As I gaze on the ample figure of my friend from Indiana, and as I listen to him, I am reminded of Chauncey Depew who said to the equally obese William Howard Taft at a dinner before the latter became President, &#x27;I hope, if it is a girl, Mr. Taft will name it for his charming wife.&#x27; &quot;To which Taft responded, &#x27;if it is a girl, I shall, of course, name it for my lovely helpmate of many years. And if it is a boy, I shall claim the father&#x27;s prerogative and name it Junior. But if, as I suspect, it is only a bag of wind, I shall name it Chauncey Depew.&#x27;&quot;

In 1929, May Palmer-Depew donated her late husband&#x27;s papers and $120,000 to establish a department of public speaking to George Washington University. The collection is currently cared for by the university&#x27;s Special Collections Research Center, located in the Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library.

===Namesakes===
In 1908, Depew gave land to Peekskill, New York, which became Depew Park. A decade later he expanded the donation by and paid for a statue of himself for display in that park.

The Village of Depew, New York was incorporated in 1894 along the New York Central Railroad main line. The town of Depew, Oklahoma, is also named for him.

The ship &quot;Chauncey M. DePew&quot; was built for the Maine Central Railroad Company in 1913 to carry passengers to Bar Harbor. She worked along the Maine coast until 1925 when she was sold to the Day Line as an excursion boat between New York and Albany. In 1940 she was drafted to carry men and supplies between New York City and Fort Hancock on Sandy Hook. In 1950, she was sold to the government of Bermuda and spent the next 20 years as a ship&#x27;s tender, harbor ferry, cruise ship and pilot boat. Back in the States, in 1971, a storm slammed her against a breakwater in Chesapeake Bay, where she lay for three years. She was refurbished and moored in the Hackensack River between Harmon Cove and the Hackensack River Route 3 Bridge, 

 Another boat, a tugboat owned by the New York Central, was also named for him.

===Depictions===
Many artists painted Depew, including George Burroughs Torrey. The Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury painted Depew numerous times. A three-quarter length portrait of Depew seated on a bale of furs was exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1890 and is now in the Yale Club of New York City. Several other portraits followed including a portrait painted for the New York State Capitol at Albany showing Depew as he was in 1863 (now New York State Museum). The artist gave a bust-length portrait to the Museum at Peekskill in 1918. Copies of an etching Müller-Ury made of Depew, signed by the artist and the sitter, are in the American National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC, the collection of the Newport Preservation Society of Rhode Island, and the University of Cincinnati College of Design. Müller-Ury also painted Depew&#x27;s first wife in 1893, and his second wife in 1902 in 18th-century costume. In 1896, sculptor Victor D. Brenner created a small plaque in honor of his 60th birthday (which was two years earlier).

<text>George Rector Nethercutt Jr. (October 7, 1944 – June 14, 2024) was an American lawyer, author, and politician. A member of the Republican Party, he rose to national attention upon his election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1994, when he defeated Tom Foley, the speaker of the house, in Washington&#x27;s 5th congressional district. Nethercutt served five terms and left the House in 2004, when he mounted an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate.

==Early life==
George Rector Nethercutt Jr. was born in Spokane, Washington, in 1944, the son of Nancy (Sampson) and George Nethercutt, a school board president. A graduate of North Central High School, he earned a B.A. in English from Washington State University in 1967 and a J.D. degree from Gonzaga University in 1971. He worked as a clerk for Alaskan federal Judge Raymond Plummer. Nethercutt then served as staff counsel and later chief of staff to Senator Ted Stevens (R-AK) from 1972 to 1977 before returning to private practice in Washington State.

Nethercutt served as a town attorney for the communities of Reardan, Creston and Almira. He was a chair of the Spokane County Republican Party. He was the co-founder of the Vanessa Behan Crisis Nursery.

==Congressional career==

Nethercutt was first elected to Congress in 1994 in a dramatic election in which he unseated the Speaker of the House, Tom Foley. It was the first time he had run for office. The district had been growing more conservative since the early 1980s, but Foley had held on mainly by running up his totals in Democratic-leaning Spokane. In the 1994 election, however, Nethercutt ran up his totals in the more rural areas of the district while holding Foley to a margin of only 9,000 votes in Spokane and 3,000 in Spokane County, which allowed him to prevail by 4,000 votes. This marked the first time a sitting Speaker of the House was unseated since 1862, and was part of a massive national Republican landslide that saw the GOP take control of the House for the first time in 40 years. In Congress, he sat on the House Appropriations Committee and the House Science Committee. Like most Republicans elected in the 1994 wave, he had a strongly conservative voting record.

Nethercutt&#x27;s campaign against Foley, a 30-year incumbent, included significant attention to Foley&#x27;s opposition to term limits. In 1992, Washington state voters approved a ballot measure limiting the terms of Washington officials, including federal officials such as U.S. Representatives. Foley brought suit contesting the constitutionality of this limit and won in court. Nethercutt repeatedly cited the caption of Foley&#x27;s lawsuit – &quot;Foley against the People of the State of Washington.&quot; He also promised to serve no more than three terms (six years) in the House.

In the 1996 elections, the Democrats mounted a serious bid to regain the seat, but Nethercutt won by an unexpectedly large 12-point margin even as Bill Clinton narrowly carried the district. He was handily reelected in 1998. In 2000, when his self-imposed three-term limit would have kicked in, Nethercutt changed his mind and announced his intention to run again, infuriating term-limits supporters. Nethercutt was nevertheless re-elected without much difficulty in 2000 and 2002.

Nethercutt&#x27;s congressional papers are held at Gonzaga University.

==2004 Senate race==

Rather than running for a sixth term in the House of Representatives, Nethercutt decided to run for U.S. Senate in 2004, hoping to unseat the incumbent, Senator Patty Murray. He was encouraged to run for the seat by President George W. Bush. Term limits again became an issue in the campaign, as Democrats quickly seized on Nethercutt&#x27;s broken term-limits pledge.

Nethercutt was also hampered by his lack of name recognition in the more densely populated western part of the state, home to two-thirds of the state&#x27;s population. Washington has not elected a senator from east of the Cascades since Clarence Dill in 1928. Other important issues included national security and the war in Iraq. Nethercutt supported the invasion of Iraq, while Murray opposed it.

Nethercutt was a heavy underdog, and his campaign never gained much traction. In November, he lost by 12 points, receiving 43 percent of the vote to Murray&#x27;s 55 percent. While he dominated the eastern portion of the state, including his own congressional district, he only won two counties west of the Cascades, Clark County and Lewis County.

==Post-congressional life==
Nethercutt left the House of Representatives at the end of his term in January 2005, but said that he would probably not completely retire from politics. In 2005, he and two other political veterans (former Interior Department deputy secretary J. Steven Griles and former White House national energy policy director Andrew Lundquist) formed the political lobbying firm Lundquist, Nethercutt &amp; Griles, LLC. Griles resigned in 2007, after he pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice in connection with the Abramoff scandal, the top Bush administration official to do so.

Nethercutt served as Chairman of Nethercutt Consulting LLC, was of counsel for the law firms of Bluewater Strategies and Lee &amp; Hayes, and was a member of several corporate boards. He was the author of the book &quot;In Tune with America: Our History in Song&quot;. He wrote a monthly column for &quot;The Pacific Northwest Inlander&quot; newspaper, and recorded radio commentaries for several radio stations.

He was also a board member on the Dutch board of JDRF (Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation).

Nethercutt founded The George Nethercutt Foundation in Spokane, Washington. The Foundation is a nonpartisan nonprofit organization dedicated to fostering civic involvement. The foundation accepts applications from college students who aspire to be Nethercutt Fellows. The Nethercutt Fellowship involves, among other things, a trip to Washington, D.C. where fellows have the opportunity to see the inner-workings of the United States government.

==Personal life and death==
Nethercutt married Mary Beth Socha in 1977, and they had two children. He died from progressive supranuclear palsy in Colorado on June 14, 2024, at the age of 79.

<text>The Chicago &quot;L&quot; (short for &quot;elevated&quot;) is the rapid transit system serving the city of Chicago and some of its surrounding suburbs in the U.S. state of Illinois. Operated by the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), it is the fourth-largest rapid transit system in the United States in terms of total route length, at long as of 2014, and the third-busiest rapid transit system in the United States after the New York City Subway and the Washington Metro. As of January 2024, the &quot;L&quot; had 1,480 rail cars operating across eight different routes on 224.1 miles of track. CTA trains make about 1,888 trips each day servicing 146 train stations. In , the system had rides, or about per weekday in .

The &quot;L&quot; provides 24-hour service on the Red and Blue Lines, making Chicago, New York City, and Copenhagen the only three cities in the world to offer 24-hour train service on some of their lines throughout their respective city limits. The oldest sections of the Chicago &quot;L&quot; started operations in 1892, making it the second-oldest rapid transit system in the Americas, after New York City&#x27;s elevated lines. The &quot;L&quot; gained its name from &quot;el&quot; because large parts of the system run on elevated track. Portions of the network are in subway tunnels, at grade level, or in open cuts.

The &quot;L&quot; has been credited for fostering the growth of Chicago&#x27;s dense city core that is one of the city&#x27;s distinguishing features. And according to urban engineer Christof Speiler, the system stands out in the United States because it continued to invest in services even through the post-World-War era growth of the expressway; its general use of alleyways instead of streets throughout its history, and expressway mediums after the war, better knit the system into the city, and in pioneering ways. It consists of eight rapid transit lines laid out in a spoke–hub distribution paradigm focusing transit towards the Loop. 

In a 2005 poll, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; readers voted it one of the &quot;seven wonders of Chicago&quot;, behind the lakefront and Wrigley Field, and ahead of Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower), the Water Tower, the University of Chicago, and the Museum of Science and Industry.

== History ==
=== Pre-CTA era ===

The first &quot;L&quot;, the Chicago and South Side Rapid Transit Railroad, began revenue service on June 6, 1892, when a steam locomotive pulling four wooden coaches, carrying more than a couple of dozen people, departed the 39th Street station and arrived at the Congress Street Terminal 14 minutes later, over tracks that are still in use by the Green Line. Over the next year, service was extended to 63rd Street and Stony Island Avenue, then the Transportation Building of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Jackson Park.

In 1893, trains began running on the Lake Street Elevated Railroad and in 1895 on the Metropolitan West Side Elevated, which had lines to Douglas Park, Garfield Park (since replaced), Humboldt Park (since demolished), and Logan Square. The Metropolitan was the United States&#x27; first non-exhibition rapid transit system powered by electric traction motors, a technology whose practicality had been demonstrated in 1890 on the &quot;intramural railway&quot; at the World Fair that had been held in Chicago. Two years later the South Side &quot;L&quot; introduced multiple-unit control, in which the operator can control all the motorized cars in a train, not just the lead unit. Electrification and MU control remain standard features of most of the world&#x27;s rapid transit systems.

A drawback of early &quot;L&quot; service was that none of the lines entered the central business district. Instead trains dropped passengers at stub terminals on the periphery due to a state law at the time requiring approval by neighboring property owners for tracks built over public streets, something not easily obtained downtown. This obstacle was overcome by the legendary traction magnate Charles Tyson Yerkes, who went on to play a pivotal role in the development of the London Underground, and who was immortalized by Theodore Dreiser as the ruthless schemer Frank Cowperwood in &quot;The Titan&quot; (1914) and other novels.

Yerkes, who controlled much of the city&#x27;s streetcar system, obtained the necessary signatures through cash and guile—at one point he secured a franchise to build a mile-long &quot;L&quot; over Van Buren Street from Wabash Avenue to Halsted Street, extracting the requisite majority from the pliable owners on the western half of the route, then building tracks chiefly over the eastern half, where property owners had opposed him. Designed by noted bridge builder John Alexander Low Waddell, the elevated tracks used a multiple close-rivet system to withstand the forces of the passing trains&#x27; kinetic energy.

The Union Loop opened in 1897 and greatly increased the rapid transit system&#x27;s convenience. Operation on the Yerkes-owned Northwestern Elevated, which built the North Side &quot;L&quot; lines, began three years later, essentially completing the elevated infrastructure in the urban core although extensions and branches continued to be constructed in outlying areas through the 1920s.

After 1911, the &quot;L&quot; lines came under the control of Samuel Insull, president of the Chicago Edison electric utility (now Commonwealth Edison), whose interest stemmed initially from the fact that the trains were the city&#x27;s largest consumer of electricity. Insull instituted many improvements, including free transfers and through routing, although he did not formally combine the original firms into the Chicago Rapid Transit Company until 1924. He also bought three other Chicago electrified railroads, the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad, Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad, and South Shore interurban lines, and ran the trains of the first two into downtown Chicago via the &quot;L&quot; tracks.

This period of relative prosperity ended when Insull&#x27;s empire collapsed in 1932, but later in the decade the city with the help of the federal government accumulated sufficient funds to begin construction of two subway lines to supplement and, some hoped, permit eventual replacement of the Loop elevated; as early as the 1920s some city leaders wanted to replace the &quot;ugly&quot; elevated tracks and these plans advanced in the 1970s under mayors Richard J. Daley and Michael Bilandic until a public outcry against tearing down the popular &quot;L&quot; began, led by &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist Paul Gapp, and architect Harry Weese. Instead, then new Mayor Jane Byrne protected the elevated lines and directed their rehabilitation.

The State Street subway opened on October 17, 1943. The Dearborn Subway, on which work had been suspended during World War II, opened on February 25, 1951. The subways were constructed with a secondary purpose of serving as bomb shelters, as evidenced by the close spacing of the support columns (a more extensive plan proposed replacing the entire elevated system with subways). The subways bypassed a number of tight curves and circuitous routings on the original elevated lines (Milwaukee trains, for example, originated on Chicago&#x27;s northwest side but entered the Loop at the southwest corner), speeding service for many riders.

=== CTA assumes control ===

By the 1940s, the financial condition of the &quot;L&quot;, and of Chicago mass transit in general, had become too precarious to permit continued operation without subsidies, and the necessary steps were taken to enable a public takeover. In 1947, the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) acquired the assets of the Chicago Rapid Transit Company and the Chicago Surface Lines, operator of the city&#x27;s streetcars. Over the next few years CTA modernized the &quot;L&quot;, replacing wooden cars with new steel ones and closing lightly used branch lines and stations, many of which had been spaced only a quarter-mile apart.

The CTA introduced fare cards for the first time in 1997. Rail service to the O&#x27;Hare International Airport first opened in 1984 and to the Midway International Airport in 1993. That same year, the CTA renamed all of its rail lines; they are now identified by color.
==== Skip-stop service ====

Later, after assuming control of the &quot;L&quot;, the CTA introduced A/B skip-stop service. Under this service, trains were designated as either &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; trains, and stations were alternately designated as &quot;A&quot; stations or &quot;B&quot; stations, with heavily used stations designated as both – &quot;AB&quot;. &quot;A&quot; trains would stop only at &quot;A&quot; and &quot;AB&quot; stations, and &quot;B&quot; trains would stop only at &quot;B&quot; and &quot;AB&quot; stations.

Station signage carried the station&#x27;s skip-stop letter and was also color-coded by skip-stop type; &quot;A&quot; stations had red signage, &quot;B&quot; stations had green signage, and &quot;AB&quot; stations had blue signage. The system was designed to speed up lines by having trains skip stations while still allowing for frequent service at the heavily used &quot;AB&quot; stations.

A/B skip-stop service debuted on the Lake Street Elevated in 1948, and the service proved effective as travel times were cut by a third. By the 1950s, the service was used throughout the system. All lines used the A/B skip-stop service between the 1950s and the 1990s with the exception of the Evanston and Skokie lines, which were suburban-only lines and did not justify skip-stop service.

On the lines with branches, skip-stop service sent all &quot;A&quot; trains to one branch and &quot;B&quot; trains to another branch. On what became the Blue Line, &quot;A&quot; trains were routed on the Congress branch while &quot;B&quot; trains were sent to the Douglas branch.

On the North-South Line, &quot;A&quot; trains went to the Englewood branch and &quot;B&quot; trains went to the Jackson Park branch. In both cases, individual stops were not skipped beyond the points where those branches diverged. As time went by, the time periods which employed skip-stop service gradually decreased, as the waits at &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; stations became increasingly longer during non-peak service.

By the 1990s, use of the A/B skip-stop system was only used during rush hour service. Another problem was that trains skipping stations to save time still could not pass the train that was directly ahead, so skipping stations was not advantageous in all regards. In 1993, the CTA began to eliminate skip-stop service when it switched the southern branches of the West-South and North-South Lines to improve rider efficiency, creating the current Red and Green Lines. From this point, Green Line trains made all stops along the entire route, while Red Line trains stopped at all stations south of Harrison. The elimination of A/B skip-stop service continued with the opening of the all-stop Orange Line and the conversion of the Brown Line to all-stop service.

In April 1995, the last of the A/B skip-stop system was eliminated with the conversion of the O&#x27;Hare branch of the Blue Line and the Howard branch of the Red Line to all-stop service. The removal of skip-stop service resulted in some increases in travel times, and greatly increased ridership at former &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; stations due to increased train frequencies. Station signage highlighting the former skip-stop patterns would remain into the 2000s, when it was gradually replaced across the system.

==== New rolling stock ====
The first air-conditioned cars were introduced in 1964. The last pre–World War II cars were retired in 1973. New lines were built in expressway medians, a technique implemented in Chicago and followed by other cities worldwide. The Congress branch, built in the median of the Eisenhower Expressway, replaced the Garfield Park &quot;L&quot; in 1958. The Dan Ryan branch, built in the median of the Dan Ryan Expressway, opened on September 28, 1969, followed by an extension of the Milwaukee elevated into the Kennedy Expressway in 1970.

=== The &quot;L&quot; today ===
As of 2014, Chicago &quot;L&quot; trains run over a total of of track.

==== Ridership ====

Ridership has been growing steadily after the CTA takeover despite declining mass transit usage nationwide, with an average of 594,000 riders boarding each weekday in 1960 and 759,866 in 2016 (or 47% of all CTA rides). Due to the Loop Flood in April 1992, ridership was at 418,000 that year because CTA was forced to suspend operation for several weeks in both the State and Dearborn subways, used by the most heavily traveled lines.

Growing ridership has not been uniformly distributed. Use of North Side lines is heavy and continues to grow, while that of West Side and South Side lines tend to remain stable. Ridership on the North Side Brown Line, for instance, has increased 83% since 1979, necessitating a station reconstruction project to accommodate longer trains.
Annual traffic on the Howard branch of the Red Line, which reached 38.7 million in 2010 and 40.9 million in 2011, has exceeded the 1927 prewar peak of 38.5 million. The section of the Blue Line between the Loop and Logan Square, which serves once-neglected but now bustling neighborhoods such as Wicker Park, Bucktown, and Palmer Square, has seen a 54% increase in weekday riders since 1992. On the other hand, weekday ridership on the South Side portion of the Green Line, which closed for two years for reconstruction from January 1994 to May 1996, was 50,400 in 1978 but only 13,000 in 2006.

Boardings at the 95th/Dan Ryan stop on the Red Line, though still among the system&#x27;s busiest at 11,100 riders per weekday as of February 2015, are less than half the peak volume in the 1980s. In 1976, three North Side &quot;L&quot; branches – what were then known as the Howard, Milwaukee, and Ravenswood lines − accounted for 42% of non-downtown boardings. Today (with the help of the Blue Line extension to O&#x27;Hare), they account for 58%.

The North Side, which has historically been the highest density area of the city, reflects the Chicago building boom between 2000 and 2010, which has focused primarily on North Side neighborhoods and downtown. It may ease somewhat in the wake of the current high level of residential construction along the south lakefront. For example, ridership at the linked Roosevelt stops on the Green, Orange, and Red Lines, which serve the burgeoning South Loop neighborhood, has tripled since 1992, with an average of 8,000 boardings per weekday.

Patronage at the Cermak-Chinatown stop on the Red Line, with 4,000 weekday boardings, is at the highest level since the station opened in 1969. The 2003 &quot;Chicago Central Area Plan&quot; proposed construction of a Green Line station at Cermak, between Chinatown and the McCormick Place convention center, in expectation of continued density growth in the vicinity. This station opened in 2015.

==== Service ====
Currently, the Red Line and the Blue Line provide 24-hour service, while all other lines operate from early morning to late night. Prior to 1998, the Green Line, the Purple Line and the Douglas branch of the Blue Line (the modern-day Pink Line) also had 24 hour service. In the years of private ownership, the South Side Elevated Railroad (now the South Side Elevated portion of the Green Line) provided 24 hour service, a major advantage when compared to Chicago&#x27;s cable railroads which required daily overnight shutdown for cable maintenance.

==== Fares ====

In 2015, the CTA introduced a new fare payment system called Ventra. Ventra enables passengers to purchase individual tickets, passes, or transit value online, by smart phone, or at participating retail locations. Ventra also works with CTA buses, Pace (suburban buses), and Metra (commuter rail). Payment by a smartphone app, the Ventra app, or by a contactless bankcard is possible.

, the &quot;L&quot; uses a flat fare of $2.50 for almost the entire system, the only exception being O&#x27;Hare International Airport on the Blue Line, at which passengers entering the station are charged a higher fare of $5.00 (passengers leaving the system at this station are not charged this higher fare). The higher fare is being charged for what the CTA considers &quot;premium-level&quot; service to O&#x27;Hare. Use of the Midway International Airport Station does not require this higher fare; it only requires the $2.50 regular fare.

The higher charge at O&#x27;Hare has been the source of some controversy in recent years, because of the CTA&#x27;s plan to eliminate the exemption from the premium fare for airport workers, Transportation Security Administration workers, and airline workers. After protests from those groups, the CTA extended the exemptions for six months.

== Lines ==
Since 1993, &quot;L&quot; lines have been officially identified by color, although older route names survive to some extent in CTA publications and popular usage to distinguish branches of longer lines. Stations are found throughout Chicago, as well as in the suburbs of Forest Park, Oak Park, Evanston, Wilmette, Cicero, Rosemont, and Skokie.

;  Blue Line, consisting of the &quot;O&#x27;Hare&quot;, &quot;Milwaukee–Dearborn subway&quot;, and &quot;Congress&quot; branches: The Blue Line extends from O&#x27;Hare International Airport through the Loop via the Milwaukee-Dearborn subway to the West Side. Trains travel to Des Plaines Avenue in Forest Park via the Eisenhower Expressway median. The route from O&#x27;Hare to Forest Park is long. The number of stations is 33. Until 1970, the northern section of the Blue Line terminated at Logan Square. During that time, the line was called the Milwaukee route after Milwaukee Avenue, which runs parallel to it; in that year, service was extended to Jefferson Park via the Kennedy Expressway median, and in 1984 to O&#x27;Hare. The Blue Line is the second-busiest, with 176,120 weekday boardings. It operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

;  Brown Line or &quot;Ravenswood branch&quot; : The Brown Line follows an route, between the Kimball terminal in Albany Park and the Loop in downtown Chicago. In 2013, the Brown Line had an average weekday ridership of 108,529.

;  Green Line, consisting of the &quot;Lake Street Elevated&quot;, &quot;South Side Elevated&quot;, &quot;Ashland&quot;, and &quot;East 63rd&quot; branches: A completely elevated route utilizing the system&#x27;s oldest segments (dating back to 1892), the Green Line extends with 30 stops between Forest Park and Oak Park (Harlem/Lake), through The Loop, to the South Side. South of the Garfield station the line splits into two branches, with trains terminating at Ashland/63rd in West Englewood and terminating at Cottage Grove/63rd in Woodlawn. The East 63rd branch formerly extended to Jackson Park, but the portion of the line east of Cottage Grove, which ran above 63rd Street, was demolished in the 1980s and 1997 due to structural problems and was never rebuilt due to community demands. The average number of weekday boardings in 2013 was 68,230.

;  Orange Line or &quot;Midway Line&quot;: The long Orange Line was constructed from 1987 until 1993 on existing railroad embankments and new concrete and steel elevated structure. It runs from a station adjacent to Midway International Airport on the Southwest Side to The Loop in downtown Chicago. Average weekday ridership in 2013 was 58,765.

;  Pink Line consisting of the &quot;Cermak branch&quot; and &quot;Paulina connector&quot;: The Pink Line is an rerouting of former Blue Line branch trains from 54th/Cermak in Cicero via the previously non-revenue Paulina Connector and the Green Line on Lake Street to the Loop. Its average weekday ridership in 2013 was 31,572. The branch formerly ran to Oak Park Avenue in Berwyn, west of its current terminal. In 1952, service on the portion of the line west of 54th Avenue closed and over the next decade the stations and tracks were demolished. The street level right-of-way is used to this day as parking, locally known as the &quot;&quot;L&quot; Strip&quot;.

;  Purple Line, consisting of the &quot;Evanston Shuttle&quot; and &quot;Evanston Express&quot;: The Purple Line is a branch serving north suburban Evanston and Wilmette with express service to the Loop during weekday rush hours. The local service operates from the Linden terminal in Wilmette through Evanston to the Howard terminal on the north side of Chicago where it connects with the Red and Yellow lines. The weekday rush hour express service continues from Howard to the Loop, running nonstop on the four-track line used by the Red Line to Wilson station, then serving Belmont station, followed by all Brown Line stops to the Loop. 2013 average weekday ridership was 42,673 passenger boardings. The stops from Belmont to Chicago Avenue were added in the 1990s to relieve crowding on the Red and Brown lines. The name &quot;purple line&quot; is a reference to nearby Northwestern University, with four stops (Davis, Foster, Noyes, and Central) located just two blocks west of the university campus.

;  Red Line, consisting of the &quot;North Side main line&quot;, &quot;State Street subway&quot;, and &quot;Dan Ryan branch&quot;: The Red Line is the busiest route, with 234,232 passenger boardings on an average weekday in 2013. It includes 33 stations on its route, traveling from the Howard terminal on the city&#x27;s north side, through downtown Chicago via the State Street subway, then down the Dan Ryan Expressway median to 95th/Dan Ryan on the South Side. Despite its length, the Red Line stops short of the city&#x27;s southern border. Extension plans to 130th are currently being considered. The Red Line is one of two lines operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week and is the only CTA &quot;L&quot; line that goes to both Wrigley Field and Rate Field, the homes of Chicago&#x27;s Major League Baseball teams, the Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox. Rail cars are stored at the Howard Yard on the north end of the line and at the 98th Yard at the south end.

;  Yellow Line, or &quot;Skokie Swift&quot;: The Yellow Line is a three station line that runs from the Howard Street terminal to the Dempster–Skokie terminal in north suburban Skokie. The Yellow Line is the only &quot;L&quot; route that does not provide direct service to the Loop. This line was originally part of the North Shore Line&#x27;s rail service, and was acquired by the CTA in the 1960s. The Yellow Line previously operated as a nonstop shuttle, until the downtown Skokie station Oakton–Skokie opened on April 30, 2012. Its average weekday ridership in 2013 was 6,338 passenger boardings.

; &quot;The Loop&quot;: Brown, Green, Orange, Pink, and Purple Line Express trains serve downtown Chicago via the Loop elevated. The Loop&#x27;s eight stations average 72,843 weekday boardings. The Orange Line, Purple Line and the Pink Line run clockwise, the Brown Line runs counter-clockwise. The Green Line runs in both directions through the north and east sides; the other four lines circle the Loop and return to their starting points. The Loop forms a rectangle roughly long east-to-west and long north-to-south. The loop crossing at Lake and Wells has been described in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s busiest railroad crossing.

== Rolling stock ==

The CTA operates over 1,350 &quot;L&quot; cars, divided among four series, all of which are semi-permanently coupled into married pairs. All cars on the system utilize 600-volt direct current power delivered through a third rail.

The 2600-series was built from 1981 until 1987 by the Budd Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After the completion of the order of the 2600-series cars, Budd changed its name to Transit America and ceased production of railcars. With 509 cars in operation, the 2600-series is the largest of the three series of &quot;L&quot; cars in operation. The cars were rebuilt by Alstom of Hornell, New York, from 1999 until 2002.

The 3200-series, was built from 1992 until 1994 by Morrison-Knudsen of Hornell, New York. These cars have fluted, stainless steel sides similar to the now-retired 2200-series.

The 5000-series train cars are equipped with AC propulsion; interior security cameras; aisle-facing seating, which allow for greater passenger capacity; LED destination signs, interior readouts, and interior maps; GPS; glow-in-the-dark evacuation signs; operator-controlled ventilation systems; among other features. AC propulsion allows for smoother acceleration, lower operational costs, less wear and tear, and greater energy efficiency. The AC propulsion can take advantage of regenerative braking, meaning the train returns excess energy to the third rail as it slows down. With the DC propulsion of the previous series, they utilize dynamic braking which converts the excess kinetic energy into heat within a resistor bank.

Next-generation train cars, the 7000-series, have been ordered and are beginning to enter service. Each 7000-series rail car will feature LEDs, 37 to 38 seats, and is a hybrid of the 3200-series and 5000-series. The design and arrangement of seats were modified to improve ergonomics and increase leg room. Enhanced air conditioning will circulate air more efficiently during hot summer days. Laser sensors above the doors will count the number of passengers, allowing the CTA to track passenger volumes and change its schedules accordingly. State-owned manufacturer CRRC Sifang America (China Rail Rolling Stock Corporation) won the contract, besting the other major competitor, Bombardier from Canada by $226 million. Concerns have been raised over possible malware, cyber attacks, and mass surveillance by the Chinese government. The computer and software components and the automatic train control system will be made by U.S. and Canadian firms. The cars are being built at a new CRRC Sifang America rail car manufacturing plant at 13535 South Torrence Avenue in Chicago&#x27;s Hegewisch neighborhood. Production of the 7000-series cars commenced in June 2019. This is the first time in more than 50 years CTA rail cars are manufactured in Chicago. Ten cars in the 7000-series began testing revenue service on April 21, 2021. The base order is for 400 cars and will be used to replace the 2600-series cars. If the CTA ordered the additional 446 cars, they would also replace the 3200-series cars.

In May 2023, the CTA announced it has received $200 million funding from the Federal Transit Authority; this money will go towards the development of the 9000-series rail cars. The plan is to acquire up to 300 new train sets.

== Nickname ==

Chicago&#x27;s rapid-transit system is officially nicknamed the &quot;L&quot;. This name for the CTA rail system applies to the whole system: its elevated, subway, at-grade, and open-cut segments. The use of the nickname dates from the earliest days of the elevated railroads. Newspapers of the late 1880s referred to proposed elevated railroads in Chicago as L&#x27; roads.&quot; The first route to be constructed, the Chicago and South Side Rapid Transit Railroad gained the nickname &quot;Alley Elevated&quot;, or &quot;Alley L&quot; during its planning and construction, a term that was widely used by 1893, less than a year after the line opened.

In discussing various stylings of &quot;Loop&quot; and &quot;L&quot; in &quot;Destination Loop: The Story of Rapid Transit Railroading in and around Chicago&quot; (1982), author Brian J. Cudahy quotes a passage from &quot;The Neon Wilderness&quot; (1947) by Chicago author Nelson Algren: &quot;beneath the curved steel of the El, beneath the endless ties.&quot; Cudahy then comments, &quot;Note that in the quotation above ... it says &#x27;El&#x27; to mean &#x27;elevated rapid transit railroad.&#x27; We trust that this usage can be ascribed to a publisher&#x27;s editor in New York or some other east coast city; in Chicago the same expression is routinely rendered &#x27;L&#x27;.&quot;

As used by CTA, the name is rendered as the capital letter &#x27;L&#x27;, in single quotation marks. &quot;L&quot; (with double quotation marks) was often used by CTA predecessors such as the Chicago Rapid Transit Company; however, the CTA uses single quotation marks (&#x27;) on some printed materials and signs rather than double. In Chicago, the term &quot;subway&quot; only applies to the State Street and Milwaukee–Dearborn subways and is not applied to the entire system as a whole, as in New York City where both the elevated and underground portions make up the New York City Subway.

== Renovation and expansion plans ==

Like other large and aging rapid transit systems, the Chicago &quot;L&quot; faces problems of delays, breakdowns, and a multi-billion-dollar backlog of deferred maintenance.

The CTA is currently focused on eliminating slow zones, modernizing the Red, Blue, and Purple lines, and improving &quot;L&quot; stations. In addition, CTA has studied numerous other proposals for expanded rail service and renovations, some of which may be implemented in the future.

=== Recent service improvements and capital projects ===
==== 2000–2010 ====
During the 2000s and 2010s, the CTA has completed several renovation and new construction projects.

Pink Line service began on June 25, 2006, though it did not include any new tracks or stations. The Pink Line travels over what was formerly a branch of the Blue Line from the 54th/Cermak terminal in Cicero to the Polk station in Chicago. Pink Line trains then proceed via the Paulina Connector to the Lake Street branch of the Green Line and then clockwise around the Loop elevated via Lake-Wabash-Van Buren-Wells. Douglas trains used the same route between April 4, 1954, and June 22, 1958, after the old Garfield Park &quot;L&quot; line was demolished to make way for the Eisenhower Expressway. The new route, which serves 22 stations, offered more frequent service for riders on both the Congress and Douglas branches. Pink Line trains could be scheduled independently of Blue Line trains, and ran more frequently than the Douglas branch of the Blue Line did.

In late 2007, trains were forced to operate at reduced speed over more than 22% of the system due to deteriorated track, structure, and other problems. By October 2008, system-wide slow zones had been reduced to 9.1% and by January 2010, total slow zones were reduced to 6.3%. CTA&#x27;s Slow Zone Elimination Project is an ongoing effort to restore track work to conditions where trains no longer have to reduce speeds through deteriorating areas. The Loop received track work in 2012–2013. The Purple Line in Evanston received track work and viaduct replacement in 2011–2013. The Green Line Ashland branch received track work in 2013, prior to the Red Line Dan Ryan branch reconstruction.

The Brown Line Capacity Expansion Project enabled CTA to run eight-car trains on the Brown Line, and rebuilt stations to modern standards, including accessibility. Before the project, Brown Line platforms could only accommodate six-car trains, and increasing ridership led to uncomfortably crowded trains. After several years of construction, eight-car trains began to run at rush hour on the Brown Line in April 2008. The project was completed in December 2009, on time and on budget, with only minor punch list work remaining. The project&#x27;s total cost was expected to be around $530 million.

==== 2010–present ====
While various mayors of Chicago had recognized the importance of reliable public transit, Rahm Emanuel received credit for making improving service a top priority. In addition to local funding, he managed to secure federal dollars by lobbying.

One of the largest reconstruction projects in the CTA&#x27;s history, at a cost of $425 million, was the Red Line South reconstruction project. From May 19, 2013, through October 20, 2013, the project closed and rebuilt the entire Dan Ryan branch—replacing and rebuilding all the tracks, ties, ballast and drainage systems—from Cermak-Chinatown to 95th/Dan Ryan. The station work involved renewing and improving eight stations, including new paint and lights, bus bridge improvements, new elevators at the Garfield, 63rd, and 87th stations and new roofs and canopies at some stations. &quot;We are looking forward to providing our south Red Line customers with improved stations that are cleaner, brighter and better than they have been in years,&quot; said CTA President Forrest Claypool. Shutting down a portion of the railway instead of relegating work to the weekends enabled the project to be completed in months rather than years.

In 2014, the CTA initiated station and track upgrades on the Blue Line between Grand and O&#x27;Hare. This $492 million project has modernized stations (some of which were originally built in 1895), rebuilt tracks, replaced station platforms, upgraded water utilities, installed public art, and improved access to some stations (by adding elevators). This project, nearing completion as of 2022, is expected to cut travel time between the Loop and O&#x27;Hare by ten minutes.

In late 2015, extensive 4G wireless coverage was added to both Blue and Red Line subways, with the $32.5 million installation cost paid for by T-Mobile, Sprint, AT&amp;T and Verizon. Upon the project&#x27;s completion, Chicago became the largest American city with 4G Internet service in all of its subways and tunnels, a total of . Besides adding to passenger convenience, it also improved security by allowing CTA personnel and first responders to communicate more easily in case of an emergency.

The new Wilson Station officially reopened in October 2017. The century-old station now includes accessible elevators, escalators, new security cameras, three entrances, wider stairwells, additional turnstiles, larger platforms, new lights and signage, as well as bus and train trackers.

FastTracks is a program intended to address the slow zones and to make train rides smoother and more reliable. In order to achieve this, crews would replace worn tracks, rail ties, and ballasts. An upgraded power system along the O&#x27;Hare Blue Line branch would enable more trains to operate during peak periods. The Blue, Brown, Green, and Red lines would be worked on. This program was set to begin in early 2018 and would continue through 2021. Funding for this $179 million project comes from a fee increase imposed on mobile app-based vehicle for hire companies in Chicago, the first of its kind in the country. In Mayor Emanuel&#x27;s 2018 budget proposal, the fee went from 52 cents to 67 cents per trip. First introduced in 2015, this fee rose by another five cents in 2019.

In December 2018, The CTA Board approved $2.1 billion worth of contracts for the modernization of the Red and Purple Lines. The largest and most expensive in CTA history, this project includes the reconstruction of the junction between the Brown Line and Red/Purple line into a flying junction to reduce delays, and the reconstruction of the Lawrence, Argyle, Berwyn, and Bryn Mawr stations. Construction of the project began on October 2, 2019, and is scheduled for completion in 2025. $100 million in federal funding for the reconstruction of the Red Line was approved September 2019. In the final days of the Barack Obama administration, the federal government agreed to provide $957 million in funding in total; the rest would come from a tax hike on property owners who lived within of the Red Line.

Google announced in November 2024 that it would pay for the redesign of the Clark/Lake station in a project related to the company&#x27;s new Chicago headquarters at the former Thompson Center.

=== Planned project ===
This new rail service proposal under active consideration by CTA is currently undergoing Alternatives Analysis Studies.

These studies are the first step in a five-step process. This process is required by the Federal New Starts program, which is an essential source of funding for CTA&#x27;s expansion projects. CTA uses a series of &quot;Screens&quot; to develop a &quot;Locally Preferred Alternative&quot;, which is submitted to the federal New Starts program.

==== Red Line Extension ====
An extension of the Red Line was first proposed by then Mayor Richard J. Daley in 1969. It would provide service from the current terminus at 95th/Dan Ryan to 130th Street, decreasing transit times for Far South Side residents and relieving crowding and congestion at the current terminus, The CTA presented its locally preferred alternative at meetings in August 2009. This consists of a new elevated rail line between 95th/Dan Ryan and a new terminal station at 130th Street, paralleling the Union Pacific Railroad and the South Shore Line, through the Far South Side neighborhoods of Roseland, Washington Heights, West Pullman, and Riverdale.

In addition to the terminal station at 130th, three new stations would be built at 103rd, 111th, and Michigan. Basic engineering, along with an environmental impact statement, were underway in 2010. Alignment commenting was opened in 2016. The CTA announced the route, in length, and four new stations on January 26, 2018. Construction of the extension would begin in late 2025 and be scheduled to be completed in 2030. Contracts for preliminary work were approved in December 2018.

In August 2022, the Red Line Extension reached the Federal Funding Phase. In December 2022, the City Council approved the creation of a district that will send nearly $1 billion in tax revenue over the next few decades to extend the Red Line south of 95th Street, a major step toward completing the project after a half-century of false starts. In March 2023, President Biden’s proposed 2024 budget includes $350 million in federal funding for the Red Line Extension project. In September 2023, the Federal Transit Administration announced $1.973 billion for the extension. In October 2023, the CTA received another $100 million for the extension. In August 2024, the CTA awarded a $2.3 billion construction contract to Walsh-VINCI Transit Community Partners for the 4-stop extension, with a total project cost (including financing) of $5.3 billion. Advance construction work began in fall 2024. In January 2025, the CTA secured $1.9 billion for the extension.

=== Previously studied projects ===
These projects are currently not being pursued by the CTA because of the cost and the concerns of residents.

==== Circle Line ====
The proposed Circle Line would form an &quot;outer loop&quot;, traversing downtown via the State Street subway, then going southwest on the Orange Line and north along Ashland, before re-joining the subway at North/Clybourn or Clark/Division. The Circle Line would connect several different Metra lines with the &quot;L&quot; system, and would facilitate transfers between existing CTA lines; these connections would be situated near the existing Metra and &quot;L&quot; lines&#x27; maximum load points. CTA initiated official &quot;Alternatives Analysis&quot; planning for the Circle Line in 2005. The Circle Line concept garnered significant public interest and media coverage.

Early conceptual planning divided the Circle Line into three segments. Phase 1 would be a restoration of the dilapidated &quot;Paulina Connector&quot;, a short track segment that links Ashland/Lake with Polk. This track section has since been restored and service on the 54th/Cermak branch was transferred to the Pink Line. Phase 2 would link 18th on the Pink Line to Ashland on the Orange Line, with a new elevated structure running through a large industrial area. Phase 3, the final phase, would link Ashland/Lake to North/Clybourn with a new subway running through the dense neighborhoods of West Town and Wicker Park. With the completion of all three phases, the perimeter area would be served by Circle Line trains.

In 2009, CTA released the results of its Alternatives Analysis Screen 3, in which it decided to begin early engineering work on Phase 2, due to its simple alignment through unpopulated areas and its relatively low cost (estimated to be $1.1 billion). Preliminary engineering work was performed on Phase 2. In addition to the new line, CTA planned to build four new stations as part of Phase 2. Three out of the four would be located along existing lines that the Circle Line will utilize. These would be at 18th/Clark, Cermak/Blue Island, Roosevelt/Paulina, and Congress/Paulina.

18th/Clark would be along the Orange Line in the Chinatown neighborhood, and would include a direct transfer connection to the Cermak/Chinatown station on the Red Line. Cermak/Blue Island would be located on the newly built elevated tracks in the Pilsen neighborhood. Roosevelt/Paulina would be located on the Pink Line in the Illinois Medical District. Congress/Paulina would be built above the Eisenhower Expressway, with a direct transfer connection to the Illinois Medical District station on the Blue Line. Existing stations would provide service near the United Center.

Phase 3 was not implemented, and planning stopped after 2009. Phase 3 ran through dense residential areas, so alignment must be considered carefully to avoid adversely impacting those neighborhoods. CTA estimated that Phase 3 would be far more costly than Phase 2 due to its being underground. After a number of alternate plans were evaluated, in 2009, CTA adopted the &quot;locally preferred alternative&quot; (LPA), which stopped Circle Line work after Phase 2, and Phase 3 was relegated to a &quot;long term vision&quot;.

==== Orange Line Extension ====
A proposed extension of the Orange Line would have provided transit service from the current terminus, Midway International Airport, to the Ford City Mall, which was originally meant to be the Orange Line&#x27;s southern terminus when the line was planned in the 1980s. This would have alleviated congestion at the current Midway terminal. The CTA presented its locally preferred alternative at meetings in August 2009. This consisted of a new elevated rail line that would have run south from the Midway terminal along Belt Railway tracks, crossing the Clearing Yard while heading southwest to Cicero Avenue, then would have run south in the median of Cicero to a terminal on the east side of Cicero near 76th Street. Basic engineering, along with an environmental impact statement, were underway in 2010. This extension was canceled.

==== Yellow Line Extension ====
A proposed extension of the Yellow Line would have provided transit service from the current terminus, at Dempster Street, to the corner of Old Orchard Road and the Edens Expressway, just west of the Westfield Old Orchard shopping center. The CTA presented its locally preferred alternative at meetings in August 2009. This consisted of a new elevated rail line from Dempster north along a former rail right-of-way to the Edens Expressway, where the line would have turned to the north and run along the east side of the expressway to a terminus at Old Orchard Road.

Basic engineering, along with an environmental impact statement, were underway in 2010. Unlike extensions to the Red and Orange Lines, the Yellow Line extension had attracted significant community opposition from residents of Skokie, as well as parents of students at the Niles North High School, on whose land the new line would have been constructed. Residents and parents cited concerns about noise, visual pollution, and crime. As a result, the extension was canceled.

=== Canceled projects ===

Numerous plans have been advanced over the years to reorganize downtown Chicago rapid transit service, originally with the intention of replacing the elevated Loop lines with subways. That idea has been largely abandoned as the city seems keen on keeping an elevated/subway mix.

There have been continued calls to improve transit within the city&#x27;s greatly enlarged central core. At present the &quot;L&quot; does not provide direct service between the Metra commuter rail terminals in the West Loop and Michigan Avenue, the principal shopping district, nor does it offer convenient access to popular downtown destinations such as Navy Pier, Soldier Field, and McCormick Place. Plans for the Central Area Circulator, a $700 million downtown light rail system meant to remedy this, were shelved in 1995 for lack of funding. An underground line running along the lake shore would connect some of the city&#x27;s major tourist destinations, but this plan has not been widely discussed.

Recognizing the cost and difficulty of implementing an all-rail solution, the Chicago Central Area Plan was introduced. It proposes a mix of rail and bus improvements, the centerpiece of which was the West Loop Transportation Center. The top level would be a pedestrian mezzanine, buses would operate in the second level, rapid transit trains in the third level, and commuter/high-speed intercity trains in the bottom level.

The rapid transit level would connect to the existing Blue Line subway at its north and south ends, making possible the &quot;Blue Line loop&quot;, envisioned as an underground counterpart to the Loop elevated. Alternatively, this level might be occupied by the Clinton Street subway. Among other advantages, the West Loop Transportation Center would provide a direct link between the &quot;L&quot; and the city&#x27;s two busiest commuter rail terminals, Ogilvie Transportation Center and Union Station.

The plan proposed transitways along Carroll Avenue, a former rail right-of-way north of the main branch of the Chicago River, and under Monroe Street in the Loop, which earlier transit schemes had proposed as rail routes. The Carroll Avenue route would provide faster bus service between the commuter stations and the rapidly redeveloping Near North Side, with possible rail service later. These new busways would tie into the bus level of the West Loop Transportation Center.

These are canceled projects, identified in various city and regional planning studies. The CTA has not begun official studies of these expansions, so it is unclear whether they will ever be implemented, or simply remain as visionary projects.

==== Clinton Street Subway ====
It would run through the West Loop, connecting the Red Line near North/Clybourn to the Red Line again, near Cermak-Chinatown. From North/Clybourn, the subway would run south along Larrabee Street, then under the Chicago River to Clinton Street in the West Loop. Running south under Clinton, the subway would pass Ogilvie Transportation Center and Union Station, with short connections to Metra trains. It would then continue south on Clinton until 16th Street, where it would turn east, cross the river again, and rejoin the Red Line just north of the current Cermak-Chinatown stop. The estimated cost of this line was $3 billion, with no local funding source identified.

==== Airport Express ====
Airport Express service to O&#x27;Hare International Airport and Midway International Airport to and from a downtown terminal on State Street. On the 3200 series cars, black Midway and O&#x27;Hare destination signs exist, suggesting a possible Airport Express service, since the sign used for Express trains is written in a black background. A business plan prepared for the CTA called for a private firm to manage the venture with service starting in 2008. The project has been criticized as a boondoggle.

The custom-equipped, premium-fare trains would offer nonstop service at faster speeds than the current Blue and Orange Lines. Although the trains would not run on dedicated rails (construction of such tracks could cost more than $1.5 billion), several short sections of passing track built at stations would allow the express trains to pass Blue and Orange trains while they sit at those stations. The CTA has pledged $130 million and the city of Chicago $42 million toward the cost of the downtown station.

In comments posted to her blog in 2006, CTA chair Carole Brown said, &quot;I would support premium rail service only if it brought significant new operating dollars, capital funding, or other efficiencies to CTA… The most compelling reason to proceed with the project is the opportunity to connect the Blue and Red subway tunnels,&quot; which are one block apart downtown. In the meantime, The CTA announced that due to cost overruns, it would only complete the shell of the Block 37 station; its president said &quot;it would not make sense to completely build out the station or create the final tunnel connections until a partner is selected because final layout, technology and finishes are dependent on an operating plan.&quot;

==== Mid-City Transitway ====

It would run around, rather than through the Chicago Loop. The line would follow the Cicero Avenue/Belt Line corridor (former Crosstown Expressway alignment) between the O&#x27;Hare branch of the Blue Line at Montrose and the Dan Ryan branch of the Red Line at 87th Street. It may be an &quot;L&quot; line, but busway and other options are being considered.

== Security and safety ==
Violent crime on the CTA has increased since the COVID-19 pandemic, and as of March 2, 2022, was up 17% compared to the year before. The CTA Union has called for conductors, which were dropped in 1997 to be brought back, while the city has promised more security guards.

The CTA has had incidents where operators apparently overrode automatic train stops on red signals. These include the 1977 collision at Wabash and Lake, when four cars of a Lake-Dan Ryan train fell from the elevated structure, killing 11. There were two minor incidents in 2001, and two more in 2008, the more serious involving a Green Line train that derailed and straddled the split in the elevated structure at the 59th Street junction between the Ashland and East 63rd Street branches, and a minor one near 95th Street on the Red line. In 2014, the O&#x27;Hare station train crash occurred when a Blue Line train overran a bumper at the airport station and ascended up an escalator.

In 2002, 25-year-old Joseph Konopka, self-styled as &quot;Dr. Chaos&quot;, was arrested by Chicago police for hoarding potassium cyanide and sodium cyanide in a Chicago Transit Authority storeroom in the Chicago &quot;L&quot; Blue Line subway. Konopka had picked the original locks on several doors in the tunnels, then changed the locks so that he could access the rarely used storage rooms freely.

Some 2017, studies have highlighted the Belmont and 95th stops on the Red Line being the &quot;most dangerous&quot;.

As of 2018, the Chicago Police Department (CPD)&#x27;s Public Transportation Unit, and the police departments of Evanston, Skokie, Forest Park, and Oak Park patrol the CTA system. The CPD provides random screenings for explosives. In addition, the CTA has its own K-9 patrol units and has installed more than 23,000 surveillance cameras.

From 2008 to 2019, there have been a total of 27 derailments. Most were minor, but some resulted in serious injuries for passengers.

On September 24, 2019, a Brown Line train collided with a Purple Line train near Sedgwick on the North Side Main Line during the morning rush hour. Fourteen injuries were reported and the cause is under investigation. According to the Chicago Fire Department, the injured were later found to be in stable condition. No derailments occurred. The CTA said service resumed about an hour after the incident.

On October 3, 2019, a train operating Pink Line service on the Cermak branch struck a car that had driven past and around the gates at the level crossing on 47th Avenue near Cermak Road. Six injuries were reported.

On June 7, 2021, a Red Line train derailed near Bryn Mawr. 24 passengers were aboard. No injuries were reported.

On November 16, 2023, a Yellow Line train collided with a CTA snowplow at Howard Yard, resulting in 16 injuries.

On September 2, 2024, four people were killed in a mass shooting aboard a Blue Line train as it traveled between the Oak Park and Harlem stations.

On February 10th, 2025, green line was derailed south side.

== In popular culture ==

Movies and television shows use establishing shots to orient audiences to the location. For media set in Chicago, the &quot;L&quot; is a common feature because it is a distinctive part of the city.

=== Films ===
Some of the more prominent films which have used footage of the &quot;L&quot; include:

<text>Infinity, Inc. is a team of superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.

The first incarnation is mostly composed of the children and heirs of the Justice Society of America (JSA), making them the Society&#x27;s analogue to the Teen Titans. Created by Roy Thomas, Jerry Ordway, and Mike Machlan, Infinity, Inc. first appears in &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; #25 (September 1983). There is also an eponymous comics series starring the group that ran from March 1984 through June 1988.

The second incarnation was formed by Lex Luthor.

The third incarnation was formed by Steel.

==Publication history==
Roy Thomas and his wife Dann Thomas wrote the series throughout its run. Artists who worked on the series included Jerry Ordway, Don Newton, Todd McFarlane, Michael Bair and Vince Argondezzi. The group is assembled by Sylvester Pemberton, the original Star-Spangled Kid, in &quot;Infinity Inc.&quot; #1, when a number of JSA protégés were denied admission to the JSA and instead formed their own group. Members of Infinity, Inc. are known as Infinitors. The series ended in 1988 with the death of the Star-Spangled Kid (by then known as Skyman) at the hands of Solomon Grundy, and the group presumably disbanded shortly thereafter. Several members of Infinity, Inc. went on to supporting roles in other comic series: Fury filled a pivotal role in &quot;The Sandman&quot; and is the mother of Daniel Hall, while Hourman, Obsidian, Nuklon (as Atom Smasher), Silver Scarab (as Doctor Fate), and Power Girl joined the 21st century incarnation of the JSA. The series originally took place on the parallel world of Earth-Two, but in 1986 it was merged with the rest of DC continuity following &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. From then on, Infinity, Inc. became Los Angeles&#x27; superteam with the Outsiders, and were involved in a crossover with the New Teen Titans.

==Fictional team biography==
===&quot;Infinity, Inc.&quot; (vol. 1, 1984–1988)===
====Formation====
Hector Hall, Lyta Trevor, Norda Cantrell, and Albert Rothstein decide to adopt identities of their own and apply for membership in the Justice Society of America (JSA). They adopt the codenames Silver Scarab, Fury, Northwind, and Nuklon respectively. They are turned down, but apply again with Jennie-Lynn Hayden and Todd Rice, Alan Scott&#x27;s children. Star-Spangled Kid decides to leave the JSA to create a new group and they are joined by Power Girl, Huntress, and Brainwave Jr. They call themselves Infinity, Inc.

Infinity, Inc. first faces the JSA, turned evil by the Ultra-Humanite. They defeat the JSA and the Ultra-Humanite. In a press conference to garner media attention for the new team, the members publicly divulge their secret identities, and Hector announces his engagement to Lyta. Star-Spangled Kid forms a partnership with Los Angeles to commission his team as for-hire protectors and purchases Stellar Studios to revitalize its production of movies.

====Clashes with Helix====
Fury is kidnapped in an extortion attempt by the villain group known as Helix: the original members are Arak the Wind-Walker, Baby Boom, Kritter, Mister Bones, Penny Dreadful, and Tao Jones. They are defeated by the Infinitors, but manage to escape.

Later, the second Wildcat, Yolanda Montez, learns that she is a cousin of Helix member Carcharo and that they are products of the same genetic experiments of Doctor Love as Helix. The two teams battle to a stalemate. Bones is arrested, but the others escape.

====Crisis on Infinite Earths====
Infinity, Inc. is involved in the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; event, which results in three new superheroes—Yolanda Montez as Wildcat, Rick Tyler as Hourman, and Beth Chapel as Doctor Mid-Nite—joining the team.

====The Silver Scarab saga====
Even with all of his friends at Infinity, Inc., Hector leaves the group after a fall out with Lyta. Shortly afterward the team learns that the JSA has disappeared. The other members notify people associated with JSA members of the society&#x27;s disappearance. Professor James Rock contacts Hector, though he is presumed to be long dead. Northwind travels to Hall Mansion to confront Hector, only to find him already under Hath-Set&#x27;s manipulations, who used Rock&#x27;s alias.

Hector kidnaps Fury, and he and Hath-Set uncover the Eye of Ra, a powerful and ancient weapon. Northwind returns and leads Infinity, Inc. into a final confrontation with the Silver Scarab at Hall Mansion, which, when burned down, reveals a topless pyramid inside. While Northwind confronts the Silver Scarab in a duel, Nuklon saves Fury.

The Eye of Ra denies the Silver Scarab control and flies away. The Silver Scarab is not pure enough in the eyes of Seketh, the Egyptian god of Death, for the pureness of Hector&#x27;s heart lives on in his unborn child with Lyta. Therefore, he is not fully cleansed of his goodness and the Silver Scarab is thrown away by the Eye&#x27;s power. Northwind is able to close the Eye of Ra while Hath-Set escapes. Infinity, Inc. mourn the loss of Hector, and Northwind and Fury leave the team after his funeral.

A pregnant Lyta goes home to spend time with her parents. When Nuklon goes to visit her to profess his love, she tells him she is not over Hector yet and that she only has friendly feelings for him. Disappointed, he discovers that there is a prowler sneaking around the property. Nuklon captures him and discovers him to be Hector Hall, the new Sandman. Hector reveals that his spirit wound up in the dream dimension after the scarab ejected it from his body. The former Sandman, Garrett Sanford, died after years of service and his assistants Brute and Glob conscripted Hector to replace him. They put Hector into Garrett&#x27;s body and gave him a new life. He can only come out of the dream stream for one hour a day, but it is enough for him and Lyta to rekindle their relationship.

====Death in the Family====
During Hector and Lyta Trevor-Hall&#x27;s wedding, Harlequin (Marcie Cooper) uses trickery to make Bones and Skyman meet at Solomon Grundy&#x27;s room. She then deceives Grundy into grabbing Bones&#x27; arm and using him to kill Skyman with his cyanide touch. Upset, Bones leaves and Infinity, Inc. finds him with Helix. Doctor Love has gained control of Helix and orders them to kill Bones, but the group turns on Love and kills him instead. Helix leaves in disgust, telling Bones he is no longer one of them, but the Infinitors grant him full membership in the team. The Infinitors continue on in Skyman&#x27;s memory, but disband some time after.

===Infinite Crisis===
A post-&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; version of the original Infinity, Inc. appears in &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; (vol. 3) Annual #1 in 2008, and is known as the &quot;Justice Society Infinity&quot; after it merges with its world&#x27;s Justice Society of America. The Earth-2 versions of Silver Scarab, Fury, Jade, and Northwind are members, but their Superman is missing, their Flash is retired, and their Green Lantern (Alan Scott) is dead.

===JSA: Black Reign===
The closest that Infinity, Inc. has come to reforming is when Brainwave (under Mister Mind&#x27;s thrall), Atom Smasher, Northwind, Nemesis, and Eclipso (who at the time was being controlled by the second Wildcat&#x27;s cousin Alex Montez), were Black Adam&#x27;s army in Khandaq. Black Adam mentions in an internal monologue that he had also thought of recruiting Power Girl for the group to further strengthen the Infinity, Inc. ties.

===52===

In the aftermath of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Lex Luthor clears his name and resurfaces as a legitimate businessman. He offers a metagene-based therapy, called the &quot;Everyman Project&quot;, to regular people to allow them to develop superpowers. The therapy spawns six perfect specimens, to whom Luthor gives the identities purchased from the Pemberton Estate. He calls the new team Infinity Inc., and creates Starlight (Natasha Irons, the team&#x27;s leader), a new Nuklon, a male Fury, a new Skyman, Everyman, and Trajectory.

Unbeknownst to the team, Luthor is able to &quot;shut off&quot; any of the team&#x27;s powers at any time, as he does to Trajectory during a battle, causing her death at the hands of Blockbuster III. Trajectory is replaced by Matrix, a pin-up model who displays superhuman strength and invisibility, similar to the original Matrix.

A new version of Jade with plant-based powers debuts with the team on Thanksgiving Day, which leads to the team being attacked by an angry Obsidian, the brother of the original Jade, who died. Scott intervenes and breaks up the fight. Infinity, Inc. then claims that the older heroes will soon be replaced.

This version of Infinity, Inc. makes frequent appearances in the local media, acting both as a commercial stunt for the Everyman Project, and as a control system against rogue metahumans spawned from the Project itself.

Natasha begins to collect evidence against Luthor and the Everyman Project for Steel and enlists Skyman to help her. Skyman is later killed by Everyman, who then assumes his identity, and reveals Natasha&#x27;s duplicity to Luthor. Luthor captures Natasha as bait to lure Steel and reveals that he has used the exo-gene therapy on himself and now possesses the same powers as Superman. Recruiting the Teen Titans, John Henry storms LexCorp to rescue Natasha.

The Titans take on Nuklon and the others while Irons faces Everyman and Luthor. Luthor severely injures Irons and impales him with his own hammer before Natasha is able to destroy Lex&#x27;s exo-gene with an electromagnetic pulse from Steel&#x27;s hammer, allowing him to be knocked out easily. The remaining members of Infinity, Inc. are taken into custody while Natasha and John Henry reunite.

In &quot;52&quot; Week 50, day six, Nuklon, Jade, Matrix, and Fury are seen among the heroes during World War III. Scott asks them to help in the final push against Black Adam. They refuse and flee the battlefield.

===&quot;Infinity Inc.&quot; (vol. 2, 2007 – 2008)===

Dan DiDio revealed at a DC Nation panel in Los Angeles that a new Infinity, Inc. ongoing series would debut in September 2007 with John Henry Irons as the main character. The book was written by Peter Milligan with art by Max Fiumara.

The first issues focuses on Natasha Irons (formerly Starlight), Erik Strom (formerly Fury), and Gerome McKenna (formerly Nuklon), a year after the end of the Everyman Project. Natasha is living with her uncle John Henry Irons and is in psychotherapy along with Erik, who refers to it as &quot;our national religion&quot; and Gerome. Another longtime patient, teenager Dale Smith, attacks his therapist and realizes his powers as a psychic vampire. He takes the name &quot;Kid Empty&quot;. It is revealed that a side effect of the exogene therapy is that once the exogene itself is suppressed, the energies unleashed by the therapy remains, re-enabling the metagene in a different fashion. As a result, Natasha finds herself turning into a mist-like substance, McKenna gains the ability to duplicate himself, and Strom gains a strong, overconfident, female alter-ego. The group recruit Mercy Graves and Lucia, an Everyman subject who can psychically inflict pain on others. In #8, the team gains official costumes and codenames, and go on their first mission.

In issue #10, Mercy admits she is not ready to be on a team, and leaves. Issue #11 begins a two issue arc that ties into the Dark Side Club.

DeSaad, under the alias &quot;Bud Fogel&quot;, secretly manipulates McKenna (now using the codename of &quot;Double Trouble&quot;) by nurturing a third personality created from McKenna&#x27;s base and repressed instincts, and promising it the opportunity to take full control.

When the splintered McKenna personality is able to wrest control over the main body (as shown when McKenna&#x27;s main personality is transported in DeSaad&#x27;s labs, while his duplicate attempts to force himself on Lucia), the Infinitors try to stop him. However, the plan is revealed to be a trap. The duplicate fatally wounds McKenna to possess his body, but disappears when McKenna&#x27;s weakens. The other subjects are trapped in a machine that is designed to take away the powers of the remaining Everymen without activating their metagene. DeSaad admits he was forced to this course of action because the Everymen, even after turning into metahumans, are undetectable from Darkseid&#x27;s minions, and they could be a wild card during the planned &quot;Final Crisis&quot;.

As a side effect of the machine, the Infinitors vanish. Steel, who arrives too late, swears he will resume his search for Natasha.

Infinity, Inc. reappeared briefly in the third issue of the &quot;Terror Titans&quot; mini-series, imprisoned by DeSaad. Towards the end of the miniseries, an undercover Miss Martian tips Irons off about their imprisonment in the Terror Titans&#x27; headquarters, leading to their release.

== Membership ==
=== &quot;Infinity Inc.&quot; ===
==== Founding members ====

==== Proposed members ====
In the original pitch for the Infinity, Inc. series, creators Roy Thomas and Jerry Ordway had planned on using a young gay male as a new Harlequin.

In an interview with &quot;Alter Ego&quot;, Ordway explains: &quot;Northwind is shown—but at his side [...] is a new, young, male Harlequin, who Jerry&#x27;s notes suggest might become comics&#x27; first gay character. Or we could just assume it. Not a bad idea, and maybe we should have played it that way; but we were already going to have two Green Lantern-derived heroes in Infinity, Inc.&quot;&quot;
In promotional material appearing in &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; #28, a Catwoman-like figure, riding what is referred to as a cat-cycle, appears alongside the Infinity, Inc. group. A caption refers to her as &quot;La Garro&quot;, but she never appears in any of the team&#x27;s adventures, or its comics under this name. She was later developed into the future Infinitor, the second Wildcat (Yolanda Montez).

Sandy Hawkins, also known as Sandy the Golden Boy, sidekick to the Sandman, is also referred to as a member, but does not end up being a member of the team. Thomas briefly toyed with the idea of giving the character superpowers based on Sandy&#x27;s time as a sand-monster, but it was dropped because Thomas and others felt he could have ended up as the DC equivalent to Marvel&#x27;s Sandman, which could have further confused a situation that had been a minor irritant between DC and Marvel from time to time. It was ultimately decided that with the cast as large as it had become Sandy was one of the characters to be dropped.

==Allies==
* Pat Dugan - Formerly the hero Stripesy, he acted as team&#x27;s mechanic.
* Solomon Grundy - He acted as Jade&#x27;s protector.

== Collected editions ==
==In other media==
* Lex Luthor&#x27;s incarnation of Infinity, Inc. appears in &quot;Young Justice&quot;, initially consisting of Trajectory, Fury, and Everyman. This version of the team was founded to discredit the Outsiders and secretly assist the Light. After their connection to Luthor is exposed, the Light reworks Infinity, Inc. into the Infinitors under Geo-Force&#x27;s leadership and adds the size-shifting Kobold to the team.
** The Infinitors appear in the tie-in comic miniseries &quot;Young Justice: Targets&quot;, with the addition of Lizard Johnny and Jet.
* &quot;Stargirl&quot; executive producer Geoff Johns revealed that the two-part episode &quot;Infinity Inc.&quot;, which sees Mister Bones becoming inspired by the Justice Society of America to create his own superhero team, was meant to serve as a backdoor pilot for a spin-off series based on Infinity Inc.

<doc id="412654" wikidata="Q13911" url="?curid=412654" title="A Prayer for Owen Meany">
<text>A Prayer for Owen Meany is the seventh novel by American writer John Irving. Published in 1989, it tells the story of John Wheelwright and his best friend Owen Meany growing up together in a small New Hampshire town during the 1950s and 1960s. According to John&#x27;s narration, Owen is a remarkable boy in many ways; he believes himself to be God&#x27;s instrument and sets out to fulfill the fate he has prophesied for himself.

The novel is also an homage to Günter Grass&#x27;s most famous novel, &quot;The Tin Drum&quot;. Grass was a great influence for John Irving, as well as a close friend. The main characters of both novels, Owen Meany and Oskar Matzerath, share the same initials as well as some other characteristics, and their stories show some parallels.
Irving has confirmed the similarities. &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot;, however, follows an independent and separate plot.

==Plot summary==
The story is narrated by John Wheelwright, a former citizen of New Hampshire who has become a voluntary expatriate from the United States, having settled in Toronto and taken on Canadian citizenship.

The story is narrated in two interwoven time frames. The first time frame is the perspective of John in the present day (1987). The second time frame is John&#x27;s memories of the past: growing up in New Hampshire in the 1950s and 1960s alongside his best friend, Owen Meany.

== Style ==
John Irving uses a unique style when writing &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot;. The author and editor Debra Shostak noticed Irving&#x27;s &quot;repetitive plot&quot;, visible throughout several of his novels. Irving gave two possible explanations for this, writing about the &quot;order&quot; this brings to a plot, instead of it being &quot;chaotic and corny&quot;. This repetition also serves to place emphasis on certain key events and ideas. Irving described his writing process by saying, &quot;I have the last chapters in my mind before I see the first chapters...I usually begin with endings, a sense of aftermath, of dust settling, of epilogue. I love plot, and how can you plot a novel if you don&#x27;t know the ending first?&quot; Bernstein also notes that Irving &quot;strives for big novels in the 19th-century manner - eventful, heavily peopled stories of the sort...that you don&#x27;t see much anymore.&quot; Another hallmark of the novel&#x27;s style is that Irving writes Owen&#x27;s dialogue in all-capital letters.

== Background ==
Following motifs of faith, religion, war and friendship, John Irving discussed the backstory of &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot; before an assembly of drama students at Yale University. Irving revealed the &quot;effects of the morbid Vietnam generation&quot; on the plot of his novel. He tried to communicate, &quot;a victim of the war, but not the victim you see coming from Vietnam.&quot; He also mentioned a small boy from his New Hampshire hometown, a boy named Russell, who inspired the character, Owen Meany. This protagonist with a &quot;rock-dust falsetto&quot; became the kid from the granite quarry who later dies in the Vietnam War. Critics also mentioned the similarities in plot between Irving&#x27;s novels. Shostak recalled repetitive New Hampshire-based stories involving themes such as faith and determination. Irving has also added that his &quot;accumulated churchgoing&quot; has influenced his writing process.

John Irving&#x27;s mother, Frances Winslow, was not married at the time of his conception. Irving never met his biological father. As a child, he was told nothing about his father, and he told his mother that unless she gave him some information about his biological father, in his writing he would invent the father and the circumstances of how she got pregnant. Winslow would reply, &quot;Go ahead, dear.&quot; This theme was also used in &quot;The World According to Garp&quot;.

== Publication history ==
&quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot; was published by William Morrow and Company in March 1989. Garp Enterprises owns this copyright. Morrow released an e-book edition on March 13, 2012.

== Reception ==
&quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot; has been both widely praised and criticized. Alfred Kazin described John Wheelwright as a &quot;conscious and unapologetic wimp&quot; and referred to Owen Meany as a &quot;little squirt&quot;. However, J. Denny Weaver commented on Owen&#x27;s &quot;heroic death&quot;, and remarked on the book&#x27;s continuing theme that life is miraculous. Overall, critics found the novel to be a different but successful addition to Irving&#x27;s works. The book was on the &quot;New York Times Bestseller List&quot;.

According to publisher Simon &amp; Schuster, &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot; is Irving&#x27;s &quot;all-time bestselling novel, in every language&quot;.

Novelist Frederick Buechner, a former teacher of Irving at the Phillips Exeter Academy whom Irving quoted in an epigraph to &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot;, called it simply &quot;a really good book&quot;.

==Film, television and theatrical adaptations==
In 1997, Book-It Repertory Theatre of Seattle, created a narrative-style theatrical adaptation of the novel&#x27;s fourth chapter, &quot;The Little Lord Jesus&quot;. The adaptation is titled &quot;Owen Meany&#x27;s Christmas Pageant&quot; and has been produced seven times.

The 1998 feature-length film &quot;Simon Birch&quot;, written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson, was loosely based on the novel. The film starred Ian Michael Smith, Joseph Mazzello, Ashley Judd, Oliver Platt and Jim Carrey. It omitted much of the latter half of the novel and altered the ending. The movie does not share the same title as the book or the character names at Irving&#x27;s request; he felt that it would &quot;mislead the novel&#x27;s readers to see a film of that same title which was so different from the book.&quot;

In 2002, the Royal National Theatre staged Simon Bent&#x27;s adaptation &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany: On Faith&quot; starring Aidan McArdle as the title character and Richard Hope as John Wheelwright.

In 2009, the BBC aired Linda Marshall Griffiths&#x27; adaptation of &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot; starring Henry Goodman, Toby Jones, Charlotte Emmerson and Max Baldry as a five-part Afternoon Play on BBC Radio Four.

In 2009, Audible.com produced an audio version of &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot;, narrated by Joe Barrett, as part of its &quot;Modern Vanguard&quot; line of audiobooks.

There have also been numerous theatrical adaptations, including Yale University&#x27;s Dramatic Association&#x27;s Freshman Show.

==Cultural references==
California punk rock band Lagwagon&#x27;s song &quot;Owen Meaney&quot; from their 1998 album &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Feelings&quot; is based on the book.

The band Jimmy Eat World based the song &quot;Goodbye Sky Harbor&quot; from their 1999 album &quot;Clarity&quot; on the book.

In the movie &quot;Milk Money&quot;, the school is named Owen Meany Jr. High School.

Former Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson has passed out this book to his team in the past as part of his ritual of assigning readings to players.
Book is featured on the TV show &quot;Tacoma FD&quot;.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
Incumbent Republican Sid Morrison, of Washington&#x27;s 4th congressional district, decided to retire in 1992 in order to run for Governor of Washington. Hastings ran, but lost in the general election to Democratic State Representative Jay Inslee, 51%–49%. Although Hastings carried the Tri-Cities, he lost the rest of the district. He won three (Benton, Franklin, and Adams) of the district&#x27;s ten counties.

Hastings sought a rematch against Inslee in 1994, and defeated him, 53%–47%, winning eight of the district&#x27;s ten counties. In 1996, he was re-elected to a second term, defeating Democrat Rick Locke 53%–47%. He never faced another contest anywhere near that close, and was reelected eight more times with at least 60% of the vote.

===Tenure===

;Political positions
&quot;Top priorities must be creating jobs, getting our economy back on track, and stopping reckless spending that has left our nation with the largest deficit in history,&quot; wrote Hastings in response to Project Vote Smart. The &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; considers Hastings to be a &quot;down-the-line supporter of the House Republican leadership&quot;.

Hastings has served as Chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources since January 2011 and is a proponent of increasing domestic production of oil and gas, including drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. In November 2010 he said that &quot;Promoting new domestic energy production, including in the Arctic, will be a priority&quot; for the committee.

;Interest group ratings
Hastings has a lifetime score of 3% from the League of Conservation Voters.

Hastings is rated as one of the most pro-business representatives in Congress, according to the United States Chamber of Commerce which gives Hastings a score of 94 out of 100 based on his 16-year voting record. The 501(c)4 organization Club for Growth gave Hastings a grade of 94 out of 100.

The National Taxpayers Union gives Hastings a grade of A. Hastings has been given an &#x27;A&#x27; grade by Liz Cheney&#x27;s Keep America Safe PAC He earned a 95.15% lifetime rating, as of 2010, from the American Conservative Union.

Hastings is pro-life, demonstrated by consistent ratings of 100% from the National Right to Life Committee. He has received mixed ratings from some national agricultural groups. For 2009–2010 the American Farm Bureau Federation gave Representative Hastings a 66% rating. His rating from the National Association of Wheat Growers was 25 percent in 2008.

In 2009 and 2010, he received grades of &quot;D&quot; and &quot;F&quot; from the teachers union-affiliated National Education Association, and 0% from the American Association of University Women. In 2009–10, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America gave Hastings a grade of &quot;D&quot;.

;Controversies
Hastings was instrumental in 2002 in building the case that led to the expulsion of Congressman James Traficant (I-OH) from the United States Congress. As Chairman of the Investigative Subcommittee of the United States House Committee on Ethics, Hastings was tasked with reviewing the file from Traficant&#x27;s trial and other material to determine if there had been a violation of House rules. Hastings said on the floor of the House, &quot;After considering all of the evidence, I concluded that Mr. Traficant&#x27;s offenses were so serious and so purposeful that expulsion from the House is the only appropriate sanction&quot;. The measure to remove Traficant from the House passed 420–1.

In 1996, lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his firm had as many as 36 contacts with Hastings&#x27; office, resulting in as many as 85.57 billed hours regarding the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Abramoff bragged to the CNMI of having &quot;excellent&quot; ties to Hastings. Hastings&#x27; 2004 campaign had received $1,000 from Abramoff personally and an additional $5,647 from Abramoff&#x27;s lobbying firm, which was also one of the largest law firms in the State of Washington, Preston Gates. Preston Gates, Microsoft&#x27;s law and lobbying firm, also contributed to Washington Democrats during that cycle, including to Seattle&#x27;s Jim McDermott.

Following Hastings&#x27; work that led to Traficant&#x27;s removal from the House, he was named to the Chairmanship of the United States House Committee on Ethics. Soon after being named chairman, two senior staff members for the committee were fired, and Hastings attempted to place his office Chief of Staff, Ed Cassidy, onto the Ethics Committee staff. Democrats cast this a partisan move, while Republicans pointed out that such a change in staff is the norm with the naming of a new committee chairman. Hastings came under fire during his chairmanship of the Ethics Committee, due to claims by Democrats of inaction regarding then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay. By rule, the House Ethics Committee&#x27;s work, votes, and investigative findings are kept strictly confidential.

In 2008, Hastings, by now the ranking member of the Ethics Committee, pushed the investigation of Charlie Rangel. A four-person investigative subcommittee was formed with Hastings as co-chair. The subcommittee&#x27;s subsequent report led to Rangel&#x27;s loss of the chairmanship of the powerful Ways and Means Committee and censure by the House in 2010.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Natural Resources (chairman)
** As chairman of the full committee, Hastings may serve as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of all subcommittees.

Hastings chaired the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, also known as the House Ethics Committee from 2005 to 2007,(109th United States Congress) replacing outgoing chairman Joel Hefley. He switched to ranking member 2007–2009 when the Democrats won the majority for the 110th United States Congress. 

===Caucus memberships===
* House Nuclear Clean-Up Caucus (chairman and founder)
* Northwest Energy Caucus (Co-chair)
* Rural Health Care Coalition
* Specialty Crop Caucus
* Hastings is the senior Republican in Congress from the Pacific Northwest.

===Legislation sponsored===
* On April 12, 2013, Hastings introduced the Restoring Healthy Forests for Healthy Communities Act (H.R. 1526; 113th Congress). The bill would direct the United States Department of Agriculture to establish at least one Forest Reserve Revenue Area within each unit of the National Forest System designated for sustainable forest management for the production of national forest materials (the sale of trees, portions of trees, or forest products from System lands) and forest reserve revenues (to be derived from the sale of such materials in such an Area). The bill states that the purpose of an Area is to provide a dependable source of 25% payments and economic activity for each beneficiary county containing System land that was eligible to receive payments through its state under the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000.
* On June 19, 2014, Hastings introduced the Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America That Works Act of 2014 (H.R. 4899; 113th Congress). The bill would revise existing laws and policies regarding the development of oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf. The bill is intended to increase domestic energy production and lower gas prices. Hastings argued that &quot;the current turmoil in Iraq has already caused the price of gasoline to increase, and it serves as an important reminder of why we need to increase production here at home&quot; because it is the &quot;best way to protect ourselves from price spikes caused by international conflicts.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1967, Hastings married his wife, Claire, in Sacramento, California; the couple has three children: Kirsten, Petrina, and Colin, and has 8 grandchildren.

<doc id="412660" wikidata="Q306452" url="?curid=412660" title="Errno.h">
<text>errno.h is a header file in the standard library of the C programming language. It defines macros for reporting and retrieving error conditions using the symbol codice_1 (short for &quot;error number&quot;).

codice_1 acts like an integer variable. A value (the error number) is stored in codice_1 by certain library functions when they detect errors. At program startup, the value stored is zero. Library functions store only values greater than zero. Any library function can alter the value stored before return, whether or not they detect errors. Most functions indicate that they detected an error by returning a special value, typically NULL for functions that return pointers, and -1 for functions that return integers. A few functions require the caller to preset codice_1 to zero and test it afterwards to see if an error was detected.

The codice_1 macro expands to an lvalue with type codice_6, sometimes with the codice_7 and/or codice_8 type specifiers depending upon the platform. Originally this was a static memory location, but macros are almost always used today to allow for multi-threading, so that each thread will see its own thread-local error number.

The header file also defines macros that expand to integer constants that represent the error codes. The C standard library only requires three to be defined:

POSIX compliant operating systems like AIX, Linux or Solaris include many other error values, many of which are used much more often than the above ones, such as for when a file cannot be opened for reading. C++11 additionally defines many of the same values found within the POSIX specification.

Traditionally, the first page of Unix system manuals, named intro(2), lists all errno.h macros, but this is not the case with Linux, where these macros are instead listed in the errno(3).

An can be translated to a descriptive string using strerror (defined in string.h) or a BSD extension called . The translation can be printed directly to the standard error stream using perror (defined in stdio.h). As in many Unix-like systems is not thread-safe, a thread-safe version is used, but conflicting definitions from POSIX and GNU makes it even less portable than the table.

== POSIX errors ==

The GNU C library (GLIBC) provides the additional POSIX error values macros in the header file . These are the descriptions of the macros provided by strerror, excluding 41 and 58 as they are not in the POSIX standard:

<doc id="412662" wikidata="Q2015366" url="?curid=412662" title="Congressional Black Caucus">
<text>The Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) is made up of Black members of the United States Congress. Representative Yvette Clarke from New York, the current chairperson, succeeded Steven Horsford from Nevada in 2025. Although most members belong to the Democratic Party, the CBC founders envisioned it as a non-partisan organization, and there have been several instances of bipartisan collaboration with Republicans. 

==History==
===Founding===
The predecessor to the caucus was founded in January 1969 as the Democratic Select Committee by a group of black members of the House of Representatives, including Shirley Chisholm of New York, Louis Stokes of Ohio, and William L. Clay of Missouri. As a result of Congressional redistricting and the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, more black representatives were elected to the House (increasing from nine to thirteen), encouraging them to establish a formal organization. The first chairman, Charles Diggs, served from 1969 to 1971.

On the motion of Charles B. Rangel of New York, the organization changed its name to the Congressional Black Caucus in February 1971. The thirteen founding members of the caucus were Shirley Chisholm, Bill Clay, George W. Collins, John Conyers, Ron Dellums, Charles Diggs, Augustus F. Hawkins, Ralph Metcalfe, Parren Mitchell, Robert N.C. Nix Sr., Charles Rangel, Louis Stokes, and Washington, D.C., delegate Walter E. Fauntroy. Chisholm referred to the group as &quot;unbought and unbossed&quot;. Five founding members of the CBC were also members of Prince Hall Freemasonry, an African-American branch of Freemasonry that became involved in civil rights: Stokes, Conyers, Rangel, Hawkins and Metcalfe.

President Richard Nixon refused to meet with the newly formed group, leading the CBC to boycott the 1971 State of the Union address. After their first joint press conference, Nixon finally met with the CBC on on March 25, 1971. The Caucus presented the President with a 32-page document including &quot;recommendations to eradicate racism, provide quality housing for black families, and promote the full engagement of blacks in government&quot;. All the members of the caucus were included on the master list of Nixon political opponents.

On June 5, 1972, shortly before the 1972 Democratic National Convention nominated George McGovern for president, the CBC released two documents: the Black Declaration of Independence and the Black Bill of Rights. Louis Stokes read a preamble and both documents into the record of the House of Representatives. The Black Bill of Rights includes sections on jobs and the economy, foreign policy, education, housing, public health, minority enterprise, drugs, prison reform, black representation in government, civil rights, voting rights in the District of Columbia, and the military. These documents were inspired by the National Black Political Convention and its own manifesto, &quot;The Gary Declaration: Black Politics at the Crossroads&quot; (also called the Black Agenda).

===TransAfrica and Free South Africa Movement===
In 1977, the organization was involved in the founding of TransAfrica, an education and advocacy affiliate that was formed to act as a resource on information on the African continent and its Diaspora. They worked closely with this organization to start the national anti-apartheid movement in the US, Free South Africa Movement (characterized by sit-ins, student protests, it became the longest-lasting civil disobedience movement in U.S history) and to devise the legislative strategy for the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 that was subsequently passed over Ronald Reagan&#x27;s veto.

===Funding===
In late 1994, after Republicans attained a majority in the House, the House passed House Resolution 6 on January 4, 1995, which prohibited “the establishment or continuation of any legislative service organization...&quot; This decision was aimed at 28 organizations, which received taxpayer funding and occupied offices at the Capitol, including the CBC. Then-chairman Kweisi Mfume protested the decision. The CBC reconstituted as a Congressional Member Organization.

The caucus is sometimes invited to the White House to meet with the president. It requests such a meeting at the beginning of each Congress.

During the 2020 George Floyd protests, the CBC provided House members with stoles made from kente to be worn for an 8:46-long moment of silence before introducing the Justice in Policing Act of 2020.

==Goals==
The caucus describes its goals as &quot;positively influencing the course of events pertinent to African Americans and others of similar experience and situation&quot;, and &quot;achieving greater equity for persons of African descent in the design and content of domestic and international programs and services.&quot;

The CBC encapsulates these goals in the following priorities: closing the achievement and opportunity gaps in education, assuring quality health care for every American, focusing on employment and economic security, ensuring justice for all, retirement security for all Americans, increasing welfare funds, and increasing equity in foreign policy.

Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson (D–TX), has said:

The Congressional Black Caucus is one of the world&#x27;s most esteemed bodies, with a history of positive activism unparalleled in our nation&#x27;s history. Whether the issue is popular or unpopular, simple or complex, the CBC has fought for thirty years to protect the fundamentals of democracy. Its impact is recognized throughout the world. The Congressional Black Caucus is probably the closest group of legislators on the Hill. We work together almost incessantly, we are friends and, more importantly, a family of freedom fighters. Our diversity makes us stronger, and the expertise of all of our members has helped us be effective beyond our numbers.

Mark Anthony Neal, a professor of African-American studies and popular culture at Duke University, wrote a column in late 2008 that the Congressional Black Caucus and other African-American-centered organizations are still needed, and should take advantage of &quot;the political will that Obama&#x27;s campaign has generated.&quot;

===Congressional Black Caucus PAC===
The Congressional Black Caucus PAC is a political action committee founded as a political arm of the caucus, aiming &quot;to increase the number of Black Members of the US Congress...support Non-Black Candidates who will champion the needs and interests of the Black Community&quot; and increase the &quot;participation of Black Americans in the political process&quot;. Gregory Meeks (D-NY-5) chairs the PAC. The CBCPAC is known for its moderate-lean. The PAC caused controversy when it backed incumbent Michael Capuano, a white man, over challenger Ayanna Pressley, a black woman who ultimately defeated him. Two years later, it backed Eliot Engel, a white incumbent, over Jamaal Bowman, a black challenger who went on to defeat him.

HuffPost reporters questioned how endorsements were made, noting that the executive board included corporate lobbyists over CBC members. Representative Brenda Lawrence (D-MI-14) criticized the PAC&#x27;s endorsement policies in 2020 and called for it to be reevaluated. Color of Change, a civil rights advocacy nonprofit group, released a letter in 2016 calling on the CBCPAC to cut ties with lobbyists from industries that are &quot;notorious for the mistreatment and exploitation of Black people&quot; including private prisons, pharmaceutical companies, student loan creditors, and big tobacco.

== Membership ==

The caucus has grown steadily as more black members have been elected. At its formal founding in 1971, the caucus had thirteen members. As of 2023, it had 55 members, including two who are non-voting members of the House, representing the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

===Senate members===
As of 2023, there have been ten black senators since the caucus&#x27;s founding. The eight black U.S. senators, all Democrats, who are or have been members of the Congressional Black Caucus are Senator Laphonza Butler of California, appointed in 2023 (currently serving), Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, elected in 2013 (currently serving), Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia, elected in 2021 (currently serving), and Senator Kamala Harris of California, elected in 2016, who resigned in 2021 to take on the vice presidency; former senators Carol Moseley Braun (1993–1999), Barack Obama (2005–2008), and Roland Burris (2008–2010), all of Illinois; and former senator Mo Cowan (2013) of Massachusetts.

Burris was appointed by Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich in December 2008 to fill Obama&#x27;s seat for the remaining two years of his Senate term after Obama was elected president of the United States. Cowan was appointed to temporarily serve until a special election after John Kerry vacated his Senate seat to become U.S. secretary of state.

Senator Edward Brooke, a Republican who represented Massachusetts in the 1960s and 1970s, was not a member of the CBC. In 2013, Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, also chose not to join the CBC after being appointed to fill Jim DeMint&#x27;s Senate seat.

===Black Republicans in the CBC===
The caucus is officially non-partisan; but, in practice, the vast majority of Black politicians elected to Congress since the CBC&#x27;s founding have been Democrats. 

Twelve Black Republicans have been elected to Congress since the caucus was founded in 1971: 
* Senator Edward Brooke of Massachusetts (1967–1979)
* Delegate Melvin H. Evans of the Virgin Islands (1979–1981)
* Representative Gary Franks of Connecticut (1991–1997)
* Representative J. C. Watts of Oklahoma (1995–2003)
* Representative Allen West of Florida (2011–2013)
* Senator &amp; Representative Tim Scott of South Carolina (2011–present)
* Representative Will Hurd of Texas (2015–2021)
* Representative Mia Love of Utah (2015–2019)
* Representative Byron Donalds of Florida (2021–present)
* Representative Burgess Owens of Utah (2021–present)
* Representative Wesley Hunt of Texas (2023–present)
* Representative John James of Michigan (2023–present)

Of these twelve, only Evans, Franks, West, and Love joined the CBC.

Edward Brooke was the only serving Black U.S. senator when the CBC was founded in 1971, but he never joined the group and sometimes clashed with its leaders. In 1979 Melvin H. Evans, a non-voting delegate from the Virgin Islands, became the first Republican member in the group&#x27;s history. Gary Franks was the first Republican voting congressman to join in 1991, though he was at times excluded from CBC strategy sessions, skipped meetings, and threatened to quit the caucus.

J. C. Watts did not join the CBC when he entered Congress in 1995, and after Franks left Congress in 1997, no Republicans joined the CBC for fourteen years until Allen West joined the caucus in 2011, though fellow freshman congressman Tim Scott declined to join. After West was defeated for re-election, the CBC became a Democrat-only caucus once again in 2013.

In 2014, two black Republicans were elected to the House. Upon taking office, Will Hurd from Texas declined to join the caucus, while Mia Love from Utah, the first black Republican congresswoman, joined.

In 2021, newly elected black Republican Byron Donalds was blocked from joining the CBC.

=== Non-black membership ===
All past and present members of the caucus have been Black. In 2006, while running for Congress in a Tennessee district which is 60% black, Steve Cohen, who is white, pledged to apply for membership in order to represent his constituents. However, after his election, his application was refused. Although the bylaws of the caucus do not make race a prerequisite for membership, former and current members of the caucus agreed that the group should remain &quot;exclusively black&quot;. In response to the decision, Cohen referred to his campaign promise as &quot;a social faux pas&quot; because &quot;It&#x27;s their caucus and they do things their way. You don&#x27;t force your way in. You need to be invited.&quot;

Representative Lacy Clay, a Democrat from Missouri and the son of Representative Bill Clay, a co-founder of the caucus, said: &quot;Mr. Cohen asked for admission, and he got his answer. He is white and the caucus is black. It is time to move on. We have racial policies to pursue and we are pursuing them, as Mr. Cohen has learned. It is an unwritten rule. It is understood.&quot; Clay also issued the following statement:

Quite simply, Representative Cohen will have to accept what the rest of the country will have to accept—there has been an unofficial Congressional White Caucus for over 200 years, and now it is our turn to say who can join &#x27;the club.&#x27; He does not, and cannot, meet the membership criteria unless he can change his skin color. Primarily, we are concerned with the needs and concerns of the black population, and we will not allow white America to infringe on those objectives.

Later the same week, Representative Tom Tancredo, a Republican from Colorado, objected to the continued existence of the CBC as well as the Democratic Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Republican Congressional Hispanic Conference arguing that &quot;It is utterly hypocritical for Congress to extol the virtues of a color-blind society while officially sanctioning caucuses that are based solely on race. If we are serious about achieving the goal of a colorblind society, Congress should lead by example and end these divisive, race-based caucuses.&quot;

===Black Latino membership===
Prior to 2017, no one had attempted to be in both the CBC and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC). In the 2016 House elections, Afro-Dominican State Senator Adriano Espaillat was elected to an open seat after twice trying to unseat CBC founder Charlie Rangel (who also has Puerto Rican ancestry) in the Democratic primary. Espaillat signaled that he wanted to join the CBC as well as the CHC, but it was reported that he was rebuffed, and it was insinuated that the cause was bad blood over the attempted primary challenges of Rangel.

In the 2018 elections, Afro-Latino Democrat Antonio Delgado was elected and joined the CBC, making no public effort to join the CHC as well. In the 2020 elections, Afro-Puerto Rican Democratic candidate Ritchie Torres published an op-ed claiming that he was prevented from joining both the CBC and CHC as he wished to do, a claim which was denied by then-CBC chair Karen Bass. After being elected to Congress, Torres successfully joined both the CBC and CHC.

Baird held over 300 town halls, or one for approximately every week and a half he was in office. Although they usually had around 50 participants, when held during passionate debates, they had up to 3000.

===Visit to Gaza Strip===
On February 19, 2009, Baird, together with fellow congressman Keith Ellison (D-MN), visited Gaza to view firsthand the destruction from the Gaza War and meet with international and local relief agencies. Others in the visit included Senator John Kerry (D-MA). The visit, which was not sanctioned by the Obama Administration, was the first time anyone from the U.S. government had entered Gaza in more than three years. Baird said:

After Baird&#x27;s third visit to Gaza in February 2010, he called on the U.S. to end the blockade and to deliver humanitarian supplies, which could include withholding military aid from Israel, saying the U.S. needed to be more serious about getting Israel to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

==Political campaigns==
Baird challenged Republican incumbent Linda Smith in 1996 and lost by only 887 votes. Smith gave up the seat to make an unsuccessful bid for the United States Senate in 1998. Baird ran again and defeated State Senator Don Benton with 54.7% of the vote. He never faced another race that close, and was reelected five times.

On December 9, 2009, Baird announced he would not run for reelection in 2010. After his retirement, Baird and his family moved to Edmonds, Washington, and he wrote books on American politics.

<text>Conflict resolution is conceptualized as the methods and processes involved in facilitating the peaceful ending of conflict and retribution. Committed group members attempt to resolve group conflicts by actively communicating information about their conflicting motives or ideologies to the rest of group (e.g., intentions; reasons for holding certain beliefs) and by engaging in collective negotiation. Dimensions of resolution typically parallel the dimensions of conflict in the way the conflict is processed. Cognitive resolution is the way disputants understand and view the conflict, with beliefs, perspectives, understandings and attitudes. Emotional resolution is in the way disputants feel about a conflict, the emotional energy. Behavioral resolution is reflective of how the disputants act, their behavior. Ultimately a wide range of methods and procedures for addressing conflict exist, including negotiation, mediation, mediation-arbitration, diplomacy, and creative peacebuilding.

Dispute resolution is conflict resolution limited to law, such as arbitration and litigation processes. The concept of conflict resolution can be thought to encompass the use of nonviolent resistance measures by conflicted parties in an attempt to promote effective resolution.

== Theories and models ==
There are a plethora of different theories and models linked to the concept of conflict resolution. A few of them are described below.

=== Conflict resolution curve ===
There are many examples of conflict resolution in history, and there has been a debate about the ways to conflict resolution: whether it should be forced or peaceful. Conflict resolution by peaceful means is generally perceived to be a better option. The conflict resolution curve derived from an analytical model that offers a peaceful solution by motivating conflicting entities. Forced resolution of conflict might invoke another conflict in the future.

Conflict resolution curve (CRC) separates conflict styles into two separate domains: domain of competing entities and domain of accommodating entities. There is a sort of agreement between targets and aggressors on this curve. Their judgements of badness compared to goodness of each other are analogous on CRC. So, arrival of conflicting entities to some negotiable points on CRC is important before peace building. CRC does not exist (i.e., singular) in reality if the aggression of the aggressor is certain. Under such circumstances it might lead to apocalypse with mutual destruction.
The curve explains why nonviolent struggles ultimately toppled repressive regimes and sometimes forced leaders to change the nature of governance. Also, this methodology has been applied to capture conflict styles on the Korean Peninsula and dynamics of negotiation processes.

===Dual concern model===
The dual concern model of conflict resolution is a conceptual perspective that assumes individuals&#x27; preferred method of dealing with conflict is based on two underlying themes or dimensions: concern for self (assertiveness) and concern for others (empathy).

According to the model, group members balance their concern for satisfying personal needs and interests with their concern for satisfying the needs and interests of others in different ways. The intersection of these two dimensions ultimately leads individuals towards exhibiting different styles of conflict resolution. The dual model identifies five conflict resolution styles or strategies that individuals may use depending on their dispositions toward pro-self or pro-social goals.
Avoidance conflict style
: Characterized by joking, changing or avoiding the topic, or even denying that a problem exists, the conflict avoidance style is used when an individual has withdrawn in dealing with the other party, when one is uncomfortable with conflict, or due to cultural contexts. During conflict, these avoiders adopt a &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude, often allowing conflict to phase out on its own without any personal involvement. By neglecting to address high-conflict situations, avoiders risk allowing problems to fester or spin out of control.

Accommodating conflict style
: In contrast, yielding, &quot;accommodating&quot;, smoothing or suppression conflict styles are characterized by a high level of concern for others and a low level of concern for oneself. This passive pro-social approach emerges when individuals derive personal satisfaction from meeting the needs of others and have a general concern for maintaining stable, positive social relationships. When faced with conflict, individuals with an accommodating conflict style tend to harmonize into others&#x27; demands out of respect for the social relationship. With this sense of yielding to the conflict, individuals fall back to others&#x27; input instead of finding solutions with their own intellectual resolution.

Competitive conflict style
: The competitive, &quot;fighting&quot; or forcing conflict style maximizes individual assertiveness (i.e., concern for self) and minimizes empathy (i.e., concern for others). Groups consisting of competitive members generally enjoy seeking domination over others, and typically see conflict as a &quot;win or lose&quot; predicament. Fighters tend to force others to accept their personal views by employing competitive power tactics (arguments, insults, accusations or even violence) that foster intimidation.

Conciliation conflict style
: The conciliation, &quot;compromising&quot;, bargaining or negotiation conflict style is typical of individuals who possess an intermediate level of concern for both personal and others&#x27; outcomes. Compromisers value fairness and, in doing so, anticipate mutual give-and-take interactions. By accepting some demands put forth by others, compromisers believe this agreeableness will encourage others to meet them halfway, thus promoting conflict resolution. This conflict style can be considered an extension of both &quot;yielding&quot; and &quot;cooperative&quot; strategies.

Cooperation conflict style
: Characterized by an active concern for both pro-social and pro-self behavior, the cooperation, integration, confrontation or problem-solving conflict style is typically used when an individual has elevated interests in their own outcomes as well as in the outcomes of others. During conflict, cooperators collaborate with others in an effort to find an amicable solution that satisfies all parties involved in the conflict. Individuals using this type of conflict style tend to be both highly assertive and highly empathetic. By seeing conflict as a creative opportunity, collaborators willingly invest time and resources into finding a &quot;win-win&quot; solution. According to the literature on conflict resolution, a cooperative conflict resolution style is recommended above all others. This resolution may be achieved by lowering the aggressor&#x27;s guard while raising the ego.

=== Relational dialectics theory ===
Relational dialectics theory (RDT), introduced by Leslie Baxter and Barbara Matgomery (1988), explores the ways in which people in relationships use verbal communication to manage conflict and contradiction as opposed to psychology. This concept focuses on maintaining a relationship even through contradictions that arise and how relationships are managed through coordinated talk. RDT assumes that relationships are composed of opposing tendencies, are constantly changing, and tensions arises from intimate relationships.

The main concepts of RDT are:

* Contradictions – The concept is that the contrary has the characteristics of its opposite. People can seek to be in a relationship but still need their space.
* Totality – The totality comes when the opposites unite. Thus, the relationship is balanced with contradictions and only then it reaches totality
* Process – Comprehended through various social processes. These processes simultaneously continue within a relationship in a recurring manner.
* Praxis – The relationship progresses with experience and both people interact and communicate effectively to meet their needs. Praxis is a concept of practicability in making decisions in a relationship despite opposing wants and needs

=== Strategy of conflict ===
Strategy of conflict, by Thomas Schelling, is the study of negotiation during conflict and strategic behavior that results in the development of &quot;conflict behavior&quot;. This idea is based largely on game theory. In &quot;A Reorientation of Game Theory&quot;, Schelling discusses ways in which one can redirect the focus of a conflict in order to gain advantage over an opponent.

* Conflict is a contest. Rational behavior, in this contest, is a matter of judgment and perception.
* Strategy makes predictions using &quot;rational behavior – behavior motivated by a serious calculation of advantages, a calculation that in turn is based on an explicit and internally consistent value system&quot;.
* Cooperation is always temporary, interests will change.

=== Peace and conflict studies ===

Within peace and conflict studies a definition of conflict resolution is presented in Peter Wallensteen&#x27;s book &quot;Understanding Conflict Resolution&quot;:

The &quot;conflicting parties&quot; concerned in this definition are formally or informally organized groups engaged in intrastate or interstate conflict.
&#x27;Basic incompatibility&#x27; refers to a severe disagreement between at least two sides where their demands cannot be met by the same resources at the same time.

===Peacebuilding theory===
=== Conflict resolution mechanisms ===
One theory discussed within the field of peace and conflict studies is conflict resolution mechanisms: independent procedures in which the conflicting parties can have confidence. They can be formal or informal arrangements with the intention of resolving the conflict. In &quot;Understanding Conflict Resolution&quot; Wallensteen draws from the works of Lewis A. Coser, Johan Galtung and Thomas Schelling, and presents seven distinct theoretical mechanisms for conflict resolutions:

# A &quot;shift in priorities&quot; for one of the conflicting parties. While it is rare that a party completely changes its basic positions, it can display a shift in to what it gives highest priority. In such an instance new possibilities for conflict resolutions may arise.
# The contested resource is &quot;divided.&quot; In essence, this means both conflicting parties display some extent of shift in priorities which then opens up for some form of &quot;meeting the other side halfway&quot; agreement.
# &quot;Horse-trading&quot; between the conflicting parties. This means that one side gets all of its demands met on one issue, while the other side gets all of its demands met on another issue.
# The parties decide to &quot;share control&quot;, and rule together over the contested resource. It could be permanent, or a temporary arrangement for a transition period that, when over, has led to a transcendence of the conflict. 
# The parties agree to &quot;leave control to someone else&quot;. In this mechanism the primary parties agree, or accept, that a third party takes control over the contested resource. 
# The parties resort to &quot;conflict resolution mechanisms&quot;, notably arbitration or other legal procedures. This means finding a procedure for resolving the conflict through some of the previously mentioned five ways, but with the added quality that it is done through a process outside of the parties&#x27; immediate control.
# Some issues can be &quot;left for later&quot;. The argument for this is that political conditions and popular attitudes can change, and some issues can gain from being delayed, as their significance may pale with time.

== Intrastate and interstate ==

According to conflict database Uppsala Conflict Data Program&#x27;s definition war may occur between parties who contest an incompatibility. The nature of an incompatibility can be territorial or governmental, but a warring party must be a &quot;government of a state or any opposition organization or alliance of organizations that uses armed force to promote its position in the incompatibility in an intrastate or an interstate armed conflict&quot;. Wars can conclude with a peace agreement, which is a &quot;formal agreement... which addresses the disputed incompatibility, either by settling all or part of it, or by clearly outlining a process for how [...] to regulate the incompatibility.&quot; A ceasefire is another form of agreement made by warring parties; unlike a peace agreement, it only &quot;regulates the conflict behaviour of warring parties&quot;, and does not resolve the issue that brought the parties to war in the first place.

Peacekeeping measures may be deployed to avoid violence in solving such incompatibilities. Beginning in the last century, political theorists have been developing the theory of a global peace system that relies upon broad social and political measures to avoid war in the interest of achieving world peace. The Blue Peace approach developed by Strategic Foresight Group facilitates cooperation between countries over shared water resources, thus reducing the risk of war and enabling sustainable development.

Conflict resolution is an expanding field of professional practice, both in the U.S. and around the world. The escalating costs of conflict have increased use of third parties who may serve as a conflict specialists to resolve conflicts. In fact, relief and development organizations have added peace-building specialists to their teams. Many major international non-governmental organizations have seen a growing need to hire practitioners trained in conflict analysis and resolution. Furthermore, this expansion has resulted in the need for conflict resolution practitioners to work in a variety of settings such as in businesses, court systems, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and educational institutions throughout the world. Democracy has a positive influence on conflict resolution.

== In the workplace ==
According to the Cambridge dictionary, a basic definition of &quot;conflict&quot; is: &quot;an active disagreement between people with opposing opinions or principles.&quot; Conflicts such as disagreements may occur at any moment, being a normal part of human interactions. The type of conflict and its severity may vary both in content and degree of seriousness; however, it is impossible to completely avoid it. Actually, conflict in itself is not necessarily a negative thing. When handled constructively it can help people to stand up for themselves and others, to evolve and learn how to work together to achieve a mutually satisfactory solution. But if conflict is handled poorly it can cause anger, hurt, divisiveness and more serious problems.

If it is impossible to completely avoid conflict as it was said, the possibilities to experience it are usually higher particularly in complex social contexts in which important diversities are at stake. Specially because of this reason, speaking about conflict resolution becomes fundamental in ethnically diverse and multicultural work environments, in which not only &quot;regular&quot; work disagreements may occur but in which also different languages, worldviews, lifestyles and ultimately value differences may diverge.

Conflict resolution is the process by which two or more parties engaged in a disagreement, dispute or debate reach an agreement resolving it. It involves a series of stages, involved actors, models and approaches that may depend on the kind of confrontation at stake and the surrounded social and cultural context. However, there are some general actions and personal skills that may be very useful when facing a conflict to solve (independently of its nature), e.g. an open minded orientation able to analyze the different point of views and perspectives involved, as well as an ability to empathize, carefully listen and clearly communicate with all the parts involved. Sources of conflict may be so many, depending on the particular situation and the specific context, but some of the most common include:
Personal differences such as values, ethics, personalities, age, education, gender, socioeconomic status, cultural background, temperament, health, religion, political beliefs, etc. Thus, almost any social category that serves to differentiate people may become an object of conflict when it does negatively diverge with people who do not share it. Clashes of ideas, choices or actions. Conflict occurs when people does not share common goals, or common ways to reach a particular objective (e.g. different work styles). Conflict occurs also when there is direct or indirect competition between people or when someone may feel excluded from a particular activity or by some people within the company. Lack of communication or poor communication are also significant reasons to start a conflict, to misunderstand a particular situation and to create potentially explosive interactions.

=== Fundamental strategies ===

Although different conflicts may require different ways to handle them, this is a list of fundamental strategies that may be implemented when handling a conflictive situation:

# Reaching agreement on rules and procedures: Establishing ground rules may include the following actions: a. Determining a site for the meeting; b. Setting a formal agenda; c. Determining who attends; d. Setting time limits; e. Setting procedural rules; f. Following specific &quot;do(s) and don&#x27;t(s)&quot;.
# Reducing tension and synchronizing the de-escalation of hostility: In highly emotional situations when people feel angry, upset, frustrated, it is important to implement the following actions: a. Separating the involved parties; b. Managing tensions – jokes as an instrument to give the opportunity for catharsis; c. Acknowledging others&#x27; feelings – actively listening to others; d. De-escalation by public statements by parties – about the concession, the commitments of the parties.
# Improving the accuracy of communication, particularly improving each party&#x27;s understanding of the other&#x27;s perception: a. Accurate understanding of the other&#x27;s position; b. Role reversal, trying to adopt the other&#x27;s position (empathetic attitudes); c. Imaging – describing how they see themselves, how the other parties appears to them, how they think the other parties will describe them and how the others see themselves.
# Controlling the number and size of issues in the discussion: a. Fractionate the negotiation – a method that divides a large conflict into smaller parts: 1. Reduce the number of parties on each side; 2. Control the number of substantive issues; 3. Search for different ways to divide big issues.
# Establishing common ground where parties can find a basis for agreement: a. Establishing common goals or superordinate goals; b. Establishing common enemies; c. Identifying common expectations; d. Managing time constraints and deadlines; e. Reframing the parties&#x27; view of each other; f. Build trust through the negotiation process.
# Enhancing the desirability of the options and alternatives that each party presents to the other: a. Giving the other party an acceptable proposal; b. Asking for a different decision; c. Sweeten the other rather than intensifying the threat; d. Elaborating objective or legitimate criteria to evaluate all possible solutions.

=== Approaches ===

A conflict is a common phenomenon in the workplace; as mentioned before, it can occur because of the most different grounds of diversity and under very different circumstances. However, it is usually a matter of interests, needs, priorities, goals or values interfering with each other; and, often, a result of different perceptions more than actual differences. Conflicts may involve team members, departments, projects, organization and client, boss and subordinate, organization needs vs. personal needs, and they are usually immersed in complex relations of power that need to be understood and interpreted in order to define the more tailored way to manage the conflict. There are, nevertheless, some main approaches that may be applied when trying to solve a conflict that may lead to very different outcomes to be valued according to the particular situation and the available negotiation resources:

==== Forcing ====
When one of the conflict&#x27;s parts firmly pursues his or her own concerns despite the resistance of the other(s). This may involve pushing one viewpoint at the expense of another or maintaining firm resistance to the counterpart&#x27;s actions; it is also commonly known as &quot;competing&quot;.
Forcing may be appropriate when all other, less forceful methods, do not work or are ineffective; when someone needs to stand up for his/her own rights (or the represented group/organization&#x27;s rights), resist aggression and pressure. It may be also considered a suitable option when a quick resolution is required and using force is justified (e.g. in a life-threatening situation, to stop an aggression), and as a very last resort to resolve a long-lasting conflict.

However, forcing may also negatively affect the relationship with the opponent in the long run; may intensified the conflict if the opponent decides to react in the same way (even if it was not the original intention); it does not allow to take advantage in a productive way of the other side&#x27;s position and, last but not least, taking this approach may require a lot of energy and be exhausting to some individuals.

==== Win-win / collaborating ====
Collaboration involves an attempt to work with the other part involved in the conflict to find a win-win solution to the problem in hand, or at least to find a solution that most satisfies the concerns of both parties. The win-win approach sees conflict resolution as an opportunity to come to a mutually beneficial result; and it includes identifying the underlying concerns of the opponents and finding an alternative which meets each party&#x27;s concerns. From that point of view, it is the most desirable outcome when trying to solve a problem for all partners.

Collaborating may be the best solution when consensus and commitment of other parties is important; when the conflict occurs in a collaborative, trustworthy environment and when it is required to address the interests of multiple stakeholders. But more specially, it is the most desirable outcome when a long-term relationship is important so that people can continue to collaborate in a productive way; collaborating is in few words, sharing responsibilities and mutual commitment. For parties involved, the outcome of the conflict resolution is less stressful; however, the process of finding and establishing a win-win solution may be longer and should be very involving.

It may require more effort and more time than some other methods; for the same reason, collaborating may not be practical when timing is crucial and a quick solution or fast response is required.

==== Compromising ====
Different from the win-win solution, in this outcome the conflict parties find a mutually acceptable solution which partially satisfies both parties. This can occur as both parties converse with one another and seek to understand the other&#x27;s point of view. Compromising may be an optimal solution when the goals are moderately important and not worth the use of more assertive or more involving approaches. It may be useful when reaching temporary settlement on complex issues and as a first step when the involved parties do not know each other well or have not yet developed a high level of mutual trust. Compromising may be a faster way to solve things when time is a factor. The level of tensions can be lower as well, but the result of the conflict may be also less satisfactory.

If this method is not well managed, and the factor time becomes the most important one, the situation may result in both parties being not satisfied with the outcome (i.e. a lose-lose situation). Moreover, it does not contribute to building trust in the long run and it may require a closer monitoring of the kind of partially satisfactory compromises acquired.

==== Withdrawing ====
This technique consists on not addressing the conflict, postpone it or simply withdrawing; for that reason, it is also known as Avoiding. This outcome is suitable when the issue is trivial and not worth the effort or when more important issues are pressing, and one or both the parties do not have time to deal with it. Withdrawing may be also a strategic response when it is not the right time or place to confront the issue, when more time is needed to think and collect information before acting or when not responding may bring still some winnings for at least some of the involves parties. Moreover, withdrawing may be also employed when someone know that the other party is totally engaged with hostility and does not want (can not) to invest further unreasonable efforts.

Withdrawing may give the possibility to see things from a different perspective while gaining time and collecting further information, and specially is a low stress approach particularly when the conflict is a short time one. However, not acting may be interpreted as an agreement and therefore it may lead to weakening or losing a previously gained position with one or more parties involved. Furthermore, when using withdrawing as a strategy more time, skills and experiences together with other actions may need to be implemented.

==== Smoothing ====
Smoothing is accommodating the concerns of others first of all, rather than one&#x27;s own concerns. This kind of strategy may be applied when the issue of the conflict is much more important for the counterparts whereas for the other is not particularly relevant. It may be also applied when someone accepts that he/she is wrong and furthermore there are no other possible options than continuing an unworthy competing-pushing situation. Just as withdrawing, smoothing may be an option to find at least a temporal solution or obtain more time and information, however, it is not an option when priority interests are at stake.
There is a high risk of being abused when choosing the smoothing option. Therefore, it is important to keep the right balance and to not give up one own interests and necessities. Otherwise, confidence in one&#x27;s ability, mainly with an aggressive opponent, may be seriously damaged, together with credibility by the other parties involved. Needed to say, in these cases a transition to a Win-Win solution in the future becomes particularly more difficult when someone.

== Between organizations ==
Relationships between organizations, such as strategic alliances, buyer-supplier partnerships, organizational networks, or joint ventures are prone to conflict. Conflict resolution in inter-organizational relationships has attracted the attention of business and management scholars. They have related the forms of conflict (e.g., integrity-based vs. competence-based conflict) to the mode of conflict resolution and the negotiation and repair approaches used by organizations. They have also observed the role of important moderating factors such as the type of contractual arrangement, the level of trust between organizations, or the type of power asymmetry.

== Other forms ==
=== Conflict management ===
Conflict management refers to the long-term management of intractable conflicts. It is the label for the variety of ways by which people handle grievances—standing up for what they consider to be right and against what they consider to be wrong. Those ways include such diverse phenomena as gossip, ridicule, lynching, terrorism, warfare, feuding, genocide, law, mediation, and avoidance. Which forms of conflict management will be used in any given situation can be somewhat predicted and explained by the social structure—or social geometry—of the case.

Conflict management is often considered to be distinct from conflict resolution. 
In order for actual conflict to occur, there should be an expression of exclusive patterns which explain why and how the conflict was expressed the way it was. Conflict is often connected to a previous issue. Resolution refers to resolving a dispute to the approval of one or both parties, whereas management is concerned with an ongoing process that may never have a resolution. Neither is considered the same as conflict transformation, which seeks to reframe the positions of the conflict parties.

===Counseling===
When personal conflict leads to frustration and loss of efficiency, counseling may prove helpful. Although few organizations can afford to have professional counselors on staff, given some training, managers may be able to perform this function. Nondirective counseling, or &quot;listening with understanding&quot;, is little more than being a good listener—something often considered to be important in a manager.

Sometimes simply being able to express one&#x27;s feelings to a concerned and understanding listener is enough to relieve frustration and make it possible for an individual to advance to a problem-solving frame of mind. The nondirective approach is one effective way for managers to deal with frustrated subordinates and coworkers.

There are other, more direct and more diagnostic, methods that could be used in appropriate circumstances. However, the great strength of the nondirective approach lies in its simplicity, its effectiveness, and that it deliberately avoids the manager-counselor&#x27;s diagnosing and interpreting emotional problems, which would call for special psychological training. Listening to staff with sympathy and understanding is unlikely to escalate the problem, and is a widely used approach for helping people cope with problems that interfere with their effectiveness in the workplace.

==Culture-based==

Conflict resolution as both a professional practice and academic field is highly sensitive to cultural practices. In Western cultural contexts, such as Canada and the United States, successful conflict resolution usually involves fostering communication among disputants, problem solving, and drafting agreements that meet underlying needs. In these situations, conflict resolvers often talk about finding a mutually satisfying (&quot;win-win&quot;) solution for everyone involved.

In many non-Western cultural contexts, such as Afghanistan, Vietnam, and China, it is also important to find &quot;win-win&quot; solutions; however, the routes taken to find them may be very different. In these contexts, direct communication between disputants that explicitly addresses the issues at stake in the conflict can be perceived as very rude, making the conflict worse and delaying resolution. It can make sense to involve religious, tribal, or community leaders; communicate difficult truths through a third party; or make suggestions through stories. Intercultural conflicts are often the most difficult to resolve because the expectations of the disputants can be very different, and there is much occasion for misunderstanding.

==In animals==
Conflict resolution has also been studied in non-humans, including dogs, cats, monkeys, snakes, elephants, and primates. Aggression is more common among relatives and within a group than between groups. Instead of creating distance between the individuals, primates tend to be more intimate in the period after an aggressive incident. These intimacies consist of grooming and various forms of body contact. Stress responses, including increased heart rates, usually decrease after these reconciliatory signals. Different types of primates, as well as many other species who live in groups, display different types of conciliatory behavior. Resolving conflicts that threaten the interaction between individuals in a group is necessary for survival, giving it a strong evolutionary value. A further focus of this is among species that have stable social units, individual relationships, and the potential for intragroup aggression that may disrupt beneficial relationships. The role of these reunions in negotiating relationships is examined along with the susceptibility of these relationships to partner value asymmetries and biological market effects. These findings contradict previous existing theories about the general function of aggression, i.e. creating space between individuals (first proposed by Konrad Lorenz), which seems to be more the case in conflicts between groups than it is within groups.

In addition to research in primates, biologists are beginning to explore reconciliation in other animals. Until recently, the literature dealing with reconciliation in non-primates has consisted of anecdotal observations and very little quantitative data. Although peaceful post-conflict behavior had been documented going back to the 1960s, it was not until 1993 that Rowell made the first explicit mention of reconciliation in feral sheep. Reconciliation has since been documented in spotted hyenas, lions, bottlenose dolphins, dwarf mongoose, domestic goats, domestic dogs, and, recently, in red-necked wallabies.

<text>The University of North Carolina Wilmington, or University of North Carolina at Wilmington, (UNC Wilmington or UNCW) is a public research university in Wilmington, North Carolina. It is part of the University of North Carolina system and enrolls 18,848 undergraduate and graduate students each year. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

Founded on September 4, 1947, Wilmington College opened as a junior college, primarily providing education to World War II veterans. The school became a four-year liberal arts college in 1963, following legislation from the North Carolina General Assembly. In 1969, the college became a university and was renamed as the University of North Carolina Wilmington. Today, it has three campuses with the main campus in Wilmington, an extension campus in Jacksonville, North Carolina, and the Center for Marine Science near Myrtle Grove, North Carolina.

==History==

UNCW opened its doors on September 4, 1947, as Wilmington College. At the time, it operated as a junior college offering freshman-level courses to 238 students during the first school year, 77% of whom were veterans returning from military service following World War II. Under the control of the New Hanover County Board of Education, Wilmington College earned accreditation from the North Carolina College Conference in 1948 and became a member of the American Association of Junior Colleges. Further accreditation came in 1952 from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.
In 1958, Wilmington College was placed under the Community College Act of North Carolina, passing control from the New Hanover County Board of Education to a board of trustees as a state-supported college under the supervision of the North Carolina Board of Higher Education.

Wilmington College became a four-year liberal arts college on July 1, 1963, when the North Carolina General Assembly passed legislation allowing it to award bachelor&#x27;s degrees. Six years later, July 1, 1969, the college was elevated to university status under its present name, becoming the fifth campus of the University of North Carolina system. On August 22, 1977, UNCW was authorized to offer its first graduate programs at the master&#x27;s level.
The university offers 55 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 35 master&#x27;s degrees and four doctoral degrees: Ed.D. Educational Leadership; Ph.D. Integrative, Comparative and Marine Biology; Ph.D. Psychology and a Doctorate in Nursing Practice.

==Academics==

The university is organized into eight colleges:
* Cameron School of Business
* College of Health and Human Services
* College of Humanities, Social Sciences, and the Arts
* College of Science and Engineering
* Watson College of Education
* Graduate School
* Honors College
* University College

The university has 55 undergraduate degree programs, 35 master&#x27;s degree programs and four doctoral programs.

===Rankings===
The Fiske Guide to Colleges, U.S. News &amp; World Report and The Princeton Review are among the publications that have included UNCW in their rankings of universities.

===UNCW Library===

UNCW Library consists of two buildings. Discovery Hall was the result of an expansion project that opened in 2024. Randall Hall retains the library&#x27;s original namesake, William Madison Randall. The expansion added study spaces, computing stations, the data Visualization and Analysis Lab, an expanded MakerStudio, an exhibit gallery and other resources.
The expansion project started construction in May 2022 and resulted in a three-story addition of roughly 80,000 square feet. The library reopened in August 2024. In the meantime, the library staff successfully utilized their existing space by offering clubs, programs and recreational areas for staff and students. 

===Centers, institutes, and extensions===
* Center for Support of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships
* Center for Teaching Excellence
* Center for Marine Science
* Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship
* ETEAL
* Osher Lifelong Learning Institute
* Swain Center for Professional and Continuing Education

==Student life==
===Campus life===
Teal is the official school color of UNCW, with navy and gold as alternate colors.

The average high school GPA was 4.13 for incoming freshmen in 2018 and the SAT average score was 1251.

===Student facilities===

In 2000, the Student Recreation Center was opened to students, staff, and faculty members. It houses three basketball courts, exercise machines, a weight training area, an indoor running track, and an indoor climbing wall. It also includes a group exercise room which supports multiple clubs and activities, including Yoga, Pilates, and an Aikido club. In 2012, the Student Recreation Center completed an expansion of facilities, as well as construction on a new natatorium. This construction doubled the size of the existing Recreation Center.

Lumina Theater, named after the boardwalk theater that was once found on Wrightsville Beach, features 333 stadium seats, a 15.5&#x27; x 30&#x27; screen, Dolby Digital surround sound, and a digital projection system. Lumina screens blockbusters, independents, cult classics, art films, international films and student films throughout the academic year, several days a week, except during University holidays and breaks. Some notable Lumina events included a multi-part, high-definition screening of BBC&#x27;s Planet Earth series over the span of several weekends, and a yearly 24-hour movie marathon called Hawk-In.

===Housing===
On campus, the Department of Housing and Residence Life manages thirty-five residence halls and on-campus apartment/suite buildings. The buildings are managed within geographically similar &quot;areas,&quot; which are led by a Residence Coordinator (RC) and Assistance Residence Coordinator (ARC). The UNCW Residence Hall Association (RHA) is the overall governing body for the residence halls and is composed of councils from each of the residential areas.

A residential quad on the south-central side of campus, comprising Belk Hall, Graham Hall, Hewlett Hall, Loggerhead Hall, Pelican Hall, Sandpiper Hall and Terrapin Hall, houses almost 2,400 students. Galloway Hall was UNCW&#x27;s first residence facility on campus. It was the first dorm in the UNC system to be built with air condition and was originally called &quot;Dorm &#x27;71.&quot; Belk, Graham and Hewlett residence halls are configured in suite-style hall arrangements with up to eight individuals sharing a bathroom. Combined they house 570 first-year students. Originally a co-ed facility, Belk Hall was all female for quite some years before returning co-ed beginning in the 2016–2017 academic year. Pelican Hall and Sandpiper Hall were completed in 2020 as a part of the larger housing quad project. The buildings are built to mirror each other, each containing a pod-style layout and 518 first-year bed spaces. Loggerhead and Terrapin Halls were completed in 2021 and consist of 775 bed spaces, mainly for first- and second-year students in semi-suite style.
Schwartz Hall houses 160 residents and is home to mostly first-year students. Adjacent to Schwartz Hall are the University Suites, and the Fraternity and Sorority Village, which consist of seven pod-style buildings housing 400 students. Various fraternities and sororities have personalized suites within this area.

Keystone Hall, Cornerstone Hall, and Innovation House form a residential area known as &quot;Tri-House.&quot; All three residence halls were constructed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Combined the area can house 465 students, with 265 students in Cornerstone Hall, and 100 in Keystone and Innovation House respectively. All three buildings are in a traditional format.

Three on-campus apartment complexes are located at UNCW, Seahawk Village, Seahawk Crossing, and Seahawk Landing. The Seahawks are reserved for graduate students and upperclass students (including sophomores). Seahawk Village contains two, three, and four bedroom apartments, which house 524 students within six apartment buildings. Additionally, Seahawk Village contains a pool and clubhouse, accessible only to residents. Seahawk Landing contains similar two, three, and four bedroom apartments, with a combined 662 students living in seven buildings. Seahawk Landing contains a pool, accessible only to residents, with a convenience market open to the public. Seahawk Crossing contains a slightly different layout, containing four, six, and eight person apartments with a combined 662 students within four apartment buildings.

===Greek life===
Fraternities and sororities have continued to grow at UNCW with membership now around 9.8% percent of the overall student population, falling slightly below the national average. There are dozens of sororities on campus. The National Pan-Hellenic Council has 6 historically black organizations, three fraternities and three sororities. UNCW also has one Christian sorority.

==Athletics==

The UNCW athletic teams are known as the Seahawks. They are NCAA&#x27;s Division I members fielding 18 teams, 8 varsity athletic teams for men (baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field) and 10 for women (basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field, volleyball, beach volleyball). UNCW is a member of the Colonial Athletic Association. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams play at Trask Coliseum and the baseball team plays at Brooks Field. The teams&#x27; colors include navy blue, teal, and gold.

<text>Richard Ray Larsen (born June 15, 1965) is an American politician serving as the United States representative for since 2001. A member of the Democratic Party, Larsen is the ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.

==Early life, education and career==
Larsen was born and raised in Arlington, Washington, and graduated from Arlington High School. Throughout his childhood, he played youth soccer and was later a ball boy for the original Seattle Sounders. Larsen attended Pacific Lutheran University and the University of Minnesota, earning a master&#x27;s degree in public affairs. He formerly worked as director of public affairs for the Washington State Dental Association and as a lobbyist for the dental profession.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure (Ranking Member)
** Subcommittee on Aviation

===Caucus memberships===
* U.S.-China Working Group
* School Safety Caucus
* Caucus to Fight and Control Methamphetamine
* Congressional Arts Caucus
* Congressional Puget Sound Recovery Caucus
* Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus
* U.S.-Japan Caucus
* Congressional Solar Caucus
* New Democrat Coalition
* Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus
* APEC Caucus (Co-chair)
* Congressional Arctic Working Group (Co-chair)
* Soccer Caucus (Co-chair)

==Political positions==

In 2006, &quot;CQPolitics&quot; wrote:

Larsen, a member of the centrist New Democrat Coalition in the House, has carved an image as a moderate that appeals to crucial swing voters in the politically competitive coastal district in the northwestern corner of Washington State. He still maintains support from centers surrounding the port cities of Everett and Bellingham.

In 2005, &quot;The American Prospect&quot; characterized Washington&#x27;s 2nd congressional district as &quot;traditionally Democratic&quot; and contrasted that with Larsen&#x27;s voting record at the time:

Larsen won this traditionally Democratic district last year almost 2 to 1. Yet Larsen&#x27;s voting record doesn&#x27;t reflect these numbers: He voted in favor of the bankruptcy bill crafted by the credit-card industry, the Bush administration&#x27;s estate-tax repeal, and the tort &quot;reform&quot; bill supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce limiting the right to sue.

Larsen sits on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and formerly sat on the Armed Services Committee. He has raised $1.26 million from political action committees affiliated with the transportation industry and $560,000 from political action committees affiliated with the defense industry.

Larsen voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time in the 117th Congress, according to a &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; analysis.

===Abortion===
Planned Parenthood, National Family Planning &amp; Reproductive Health Association and NARAL Pro-Choice America have all highly rated Larsen&#x27;s position on abortion. He has voted against several bills that would restrict abortion rights. In 2022, Larsen reaffirmed his support for abortion rights and their protections under &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, saying he would &quot;continue to stand with women and advocates in Washington state and across the country to ensure a woman’s right to access safe reproductive health care.&quot;

===Environment===
Larsen voted for the 2009 American Clean Energy and Security Act known as &quot;cap and trade&quot;. He has cosponsored legislation that would create the Wild Sky Wilderness area in his home district and is a member of the Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus.

On February 8, 2019, Larsen came out in opposition to the Green New Deal, saying:

I am not ready to support the Green New Deal resolution. It is difficult to support the resolution right now when one of the lead sponsors says one of the intentions is to make air travel unnecessary.

In 2020, Fuse Washington in its Progressive Voters Guide noted that Larsen does not support the Green New Deal and accepted political contributions from corporations including Exxon Mobil &quot;as recently as last year&quot;.

===Healthcare reform===
Larsen has supported the House Democratic proposal for the Affordable Care Act. He voted for the reform bill in November 2009. Larsen does not support single-payer health insurance. He has said he &quot;thought it was more appropriate to stick with defending Obamacare, not to change in the middle of the controversy&quot;.

Larsen does not support Medicare for All and has said he supports the Public Option Deficit Reduction Act as an alternative. This proposal adds a public option to the Affordable Care Act using the same market-based exchanges while lowering premiums by only five to seven percent.

===Impeachment===
In 2007, Larsen opposed impeaching President George W. Bush, saying, &quot;I believe the American people elected a Democratic majority to make positive changes in their lives. If we took up impeachment, we would do nothing else for the next 2 years. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what we were elected to do&quot;. Larsen supported impeaching President Donald J. Trump on July 18, 2019.

===Iraq War===
Although Larsen initially voted against a bill authorizing military force in Iraq in October 2002, he also voted against an amendment that sought to have the United States work through the United Nations to resolve tensions instead of invading Iraq. In 2006, Larsen voted against requiring Congressional authorization for use of force in Iran, and in 2011 he voted for use of force in Libya.

Since 2002, Larsen has voted for nearly every bill put forth in the House concerning the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2006, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer described Larsen as a &quot;strong advocate for providing money to support the [Iraq War]&quot;.

In 2006, Larsen voted to endorse the War in Iraq and against a mandated withdrawal plan. In 2008, he said that troops would be in Iraq &quot;well into the next administration&quot; and likely remain &quot;for another 10 years&quot;. Larsen supported President Obama&#x27;s proposed exit strategy, which promised to remove combat troops by summer of 2010.

===Labor===
Larsen voted for the S-Miner Act and Extending Federal Emergency Unemployment Benefits and Providing Business and Homebuyer Tax Credits bill. He showed support for the interests of the Utility Workers Union of America, Service Employees International Union, American Federation of State, County &amp; Municipal Employees, and AFL–CIO. He claims to support Washington State&#x27;s economy by investing in small- to medium-size businesses to help them succeed in the global economy.

In January 2014, Larsen faced criticism from the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers for supporting Boeing&#x27;s proposal to replace pensions with a 401(k)-style retirement plan.

===Transportation===
As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Larsen has voted for every transportation bill since being reelected in 2008. He believes that &quot;sound investments in transportation keep our economy moving&quot; and improve conditions in other areas. Larsen was one of 79 cosponsors of the SAFETEA-LU bill to improve highways, increase funding for ferry systems, and expedite the flow of traffic and goods through border crossings.

==Political campaigns==

===2006===
Larsen defeated Republican Doug Roulstone, a retired Navy officer from Snohomish, with 65% of the vote to Roulstone&#x27;s 34%.

===2008===
Larsen was challenged in the Democratic primary during his 2008 reelection campaign by perennial candidate Glen Johnson. His Republican opponent for the House race was recently retired Snohomish County Sheriff Rick Bart.

For the 2008 election cycle, Larsen&#x27;s campaign&#x27;s total income was $1,336,438. His campaign spent $1,155,691. The companies that contributed the most money were Boeing Co., Microsoft Corp., American Dental Assn., McBee Strategic Consulting, and Puget Energy. The labor, finance/insurance/real estate, transportation, misc. business, and health sectors were the largest contributing sectors. The major industry donations came from health professionals, transportation unions, building trade unions, retired, and sea transport.

===2010===
Larsen narrowly defeated Republican nominee John Koster to win a sixth term.

Larsen was endorsed by the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; on October 13, 2010.

===2012===
In 2012, Larsen won reelection with 61% of the vote to Republican nominee Dan Matthews&#x27;s 39%.

=== 2016 ===
Larsen was challenged by Republican Marc Hennemann. Hennemann decided to challenge Larsen after receiving an answer he disliked to a question at a town hall meeting in Coupeville. Larsen defeated Hennemann, 64% to 36%.

==Electoral history==
==Personal life==
Larsen married Tiia Ingrid Karlen in 1994. They have two children.

<text>Wilmington College is a private college in Wilmington, Ohio. It was established by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in 1870 and is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. The college is still Quaker-affiliated and has seven core Quaker values. In fall 2018, the college set an enrollment record, bringing in 450 new students for the academic year, totaling 1,103 students on Wilmington&#x27;s main campus, and 139 students at Wilmington&#x27;s two Cincinnati branches at Blue Ash and Cincinnati State.

==History==
In 1863 three brothers, Hugh, James, and Thomas Garvin founded Franklin College in Albany, Ohio. After two years in Albany, the college was relocated to Wilmington, where the cornerstone of College Hall was laid on 4 July 1866. The institution was closed in 1868 following the Civil War. In 1870 the half-completed Franklin College building went up for auction. The building and 33 surrounding acres were purchased by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). Lewis Estes was named the first president. Following a few years of economic struggle, Estes resigned. Benjamin Trueblood, a 26-year-old recent Earlham College graduate, was named the new president. In 1875, Wilmington College graduated its first class of four students, three females, and one male. South Hall (razed 1956) was the college&#x27;s first dorm in 1876, and in 1904 the college purchased a former boarding house and named it Twin Ash Hall (demolished 1984).

In 1917, Wilmington College acquired the Lebanon National Normal School in Lebanon, Ohio.
In 1944, under President S. Arthur Watson, the college was accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and joined the North Central Association of Colleges. Following WWII, Wilmington College saw a huge boost in growth. Under President Samuel Marble, Marble Hall (1950) was constructed by students. This was due to the large boost in the middle class following WWII and the creation of the G.I. Bill. Also built by students were The Pyle Student Center (1957) and Friends Hall (1955). The current gymnasium, Herman Court was constructed in 1966.

In 2020, Trevor Bates was named as the college&#x27;s 19th and first African-American president. Bates was released from his contract in March 2023 by the college&#x27;s board of trustees and Corey Cockerill was named interim president.

The college has 25 majors, 27 minors, and 32 concentrations. As well as three graduate programs. There are 18 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Div-III. The campus features over 50 student-led organizations.

<text>This Present Darkness is a Christian novel by suspense, horror, and fantasy author Frank E. Peretti. Published in 1986 by Crossway Books after first being rejected by fourteen publishing companies, &quot;This Present Darkness&quot; was Peretti&#x27;s first published novel for adults and shows contemporary views on angels, demons, prayer, and spiritual warfare as demons and angels interact and struggle for control of the citizens of the small town of Ashton. It is critical of Eastern and New Age spiritual practices, portraying meditation as a means of demonic possession.

Sales were initially slow but jumped dramatically after singer Amy Grant promoted the book. The book has sold in excess of 2.7 million copies worldwide and remained on the Christian Booksellers Association top best-sellers list for over 150 consecutive weeks after its release. , it continues to sell approximately 8,000 copies per year. 

Its title comes from Ephesians 6:12 (RSV): &quot;For we are not contending against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world rulers of this present darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.&quot;

Peretti followed &quot;This Present Darkness&quot; up with a sequel in 1988, &quot;Piercing the Darkness&quot;.

==Plot summary==
&quot;This Present Darkness&quot; takes place in the small college town of Ashton. Bernice Kreuger, a reporter for the &quot;Clarion&quot;, Ashton&#x27;s town newspaper, is falsely arrested on prostitution charges after taking a photograph at the annual Ashton Summer Festival. When she is released the next day, she discovers that the film in her camera was destroyed.

Marshall Hogan, owner and editor-in-chief of the &quot;Clarion&quot;, decides to go to the town police station/courthouse and confront Alf Brummel, the police chief, about the incident. Brummel denies any wrongdoing on behalf of the police department and insists it was all a mistake. Brummel then advises Marshall to drop the matter. Marshall does not fall for Brummel&#x27;s story and, ignoring Brummel&#x27;s advice, begins an investigation.

As the investigation continues, Marshall and Bernice begin to realize that they are onto something much bigger than they thought. They slowly uncover a plot to take over the town by buying the college, which is being carried out by the Universal Consciousness Society, a powerful New Age group and &quot;worldwide front organization for Satan.&quot; The college&#x27;s psychology professor, Juleen Langstrat, is part of the Society. She teaches meditation, which brings practitioners in contact with spirit guides (demons), as well as witchcraft and New Age beliefs. Members of the community are thus influenced by Satan, including Brummel and the pastor of the liberal United Christian Church. When the Society decides Marshall has found out too much they take the &quot;Clarion&quot;, and his house. They also falsely accuse him of murder, adultery, and molesting his daughter, who attends the college and who unwittingly has been pulled into the Society. When he and Bernice are caught in a desperate attempt to keep society from winning out, he is arrested and thrown in jail, and she escapes, running off to find help.

Meanwhile, Hank Busche, the unwanted pastor of the little Ashton Community Church, discovers that there are many demons in the town and wonders why they have all congregated here. When he gets to be a nuisance to the demons, they have the Society falsely arrest him for rape.

Hank and Marshall meet in jail. They compare stories and finally put both halves of the puzzle together.

During the time that this is happening, the story takes on a spiritual dimension—revealing a perspective based on the idea of unseen forces at work. Lucius, the head demon, controls a group of demons including Ba-al Rafar, the Prince of Babylon, in battle against head angel Tal and his army. The angels who wage warfare for the souls of mankind look and act similarly to humans—they have names, they are in charge of specific regions of earth, and they are propelled by heavenly forces that often manifest as wings. They wear armor and wield weapons forged in heaven—most notably, swords. Demons, as well, are depicted as being ink-like shadows in the darkness, flowing from shadow to shadow, until the time comes when they truly reveal themselves as monstrous beasts with bat-wings and armor. Their spiritual combat spans from one-on-one battles to vast armies charging into each other in the &quot;unseen realms&quot; above.

Meanwhile, Bernice finds help and makes contact with the county prosecutor, the state attorney general, and the feds. When Alf Brummel finds out about this he releases Hank and Marshall. After Hank and Marshall are released, they team up against the Universal Consciousness Society and the demons working to take over Ashton—in which they are (possibly unwittingly) aided by a &quot;local&quot; demon whose position has been usurped by a somewhat more powerful one summoned by the Society, and strikes vengefully at the usurper.

==Critical reception and controversy==
The novel has been the subject of both literary and theological criticism. On literary grounds, several reviewers such as Irving Hexham and James R. Lewis suggest that the novel fits into the genre of horror. Reviewers such as Steve Rabey and Michael Maudlin appreciate the novel&#x27;s complex multi-layered plot. However, they find the novel&#x27;s characters typecast in simplistic roles of good versus evil. Other criticisms raised concern about redundant passages in the novel, stilted dialogue, and poor grammar.

&quot;Christianity Today&quot; included the book on its list of &quot;The Top 50 Books That Have Shaped Evangelicals&quot; in 2006. &quot;Christianity Today&quot; has also stated the novel led the way for later Christian fiction such as the &quot;Left Behind&quot; novels.

The theme of sexual abuse allegations against the protagonists by women and children – because they are possessed by demons – has been mentioned by several reviewers. One reviewer describes it as &quot;a terrible willingness to forgive child abuse and sexual assault if the accused was a powerful man and the accuser was a woman or child&quot; mirrored in American evangelicalism, while another notes that not only are all of the &quot;victims&quot; depicted as &quot;demonically-possessed liar[s]&quot;, but those in helping roles are also &quot;villains&quot;: &quot;Those who are on the frontline of helping children and survivors – public school teachers, therapists, social workers, child advocates – are cast as evil&quot;.

Contextualizing the acceptance of the QAnon movement, religion scholar Julie Ingersoll notes the &quot;widely influential&quot; role of &quot;This Present Darkness&quot; in &quot;[illustrating] certain views of the world and certain expectations that lend themselves to the development of a sense of embattlement and a cultural crisis that can be interpreted in apocalyptic terms.&quot; Likewise, University of Notre Dame scholar Jason Springs connects the messianic beliefs of QAnon to &quot;the same culture previously captivated and emboldened&quot; by Peretti&#x27;s spiritual warfare-themed novels.

The New Consciousness Society described in the book has been described as a &quot;spiritual conspiracy to establish a New World Order&quot;.

<text>The Three Pure Ones, also translated as the Three Pure Pellucid Ones, the Three Pristine Ones, the Three Divine Teachers, the Three Clarities, or the Three Purities, are the three highest gods in the Taoist pantheon. They are regarded as pure manifestations of the Tao and the origin of all sentient beings, along with the &quot;lords of the Three Life Principles&quot;, or qi. They were also gods who were &quot;associated with the sky, the earth and the underworld.&quot;

They were thought to be able to control and have power over time in various ways. They were sometimes seen as literally the &quot;Past, Present, and Future&quot;.

==In Taoism==
From the Taoist classic &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, it was held that &quot;The Tao produced One; One produced Two; Two produced Three; Three produced All things.&quot; It is generally agreed by Taoist scholars that Tao produced One means Wuji produced Taiji, and One produced Two means Taiji produced Yin and Yang [or Liangyi () in scholastic terms]. However, the subject of how Two produced Three has remained a popular debate among Taoist scholars. Most scholars believe that it refers to the Interaction between Yin and Yang, with the presence of Chi, or life force.

In religious Taoism, the theory of how Tao produces One, Two, and Three is also explained. In Tao produces One—Wuji produces Taiji, which represents the Great Tao, embodied by Hundun (, &quot;Heavenly King of the Never-ending Primordial Beginning&quot;) at a time of pre-Creation, manifesting into the first of the Taoist Trinity, Yuanshi Tianzun. Yuanshi Tianzun oversees the earliest phase of Creation of the Universe, and is henceforth known as Dàobǎo () &quot;Treasure of the Tao&quot;. In One produces Two—Taiji produces Yin Yang, Yuanshi Tianzun manifests into Lingbao Tianzun who separated the Yang from the Yin, the clear from the murky, and classified the elements into their rightful groups. Therefore, he is also known as Jīngbǎo () &quot;Treasure of the Law/Scripture&quot;. While Jīng in popular understanding means &quot;scriptures&quot;, in this context it also mean &quot;passing through&quot; [the phase of Creation] and the Laws of Nature of how things are meant to be. In the final phase of Creation, Daode Tianzun is manifested from Língbăo Tiānzūn to bring civilization and preach the Law to all living beings. Therefore, He is also known as Shībǎo () &quot;Treasure of the Master&quot;.

Each of the Three Pure Ones represents both a primordial deity and a heaven. Yuanshi Tianzun rules the first heaven, Yu-Qing, which is found in the Jade Mountain. The entrance to this heaven is named the Golden Door. &quot;He is the source of all truth, as the sun is the source of all light&quot;. Lingbao Tianzun rules over the heaven of Shang-Qing. Daode Tianzun rules over the heaven of Tai-Qing. The Three Pure Ones are often depicted as throned elders.

Schools of Taoist thought developed around each of these deities. Taoist Alchemy was a large part of these schools, as each of the Three Pure Ones represented one of the three essential fields of the body: jing, qi and shen. The congregation of all three Pure Ones resulted in the return to Tao.

The first Pure One is universal or heavenly chi. The second Pure One is human plane chi, and the third Pure One is earth chi. Heavenly chi includes the chi or energy of all the planets, stars and constellations as well as the energy of God (the force of creation and universal love). Human plane chi is the energy that exists on the surface of our planet and sustains human life, and the earth force includes all of the forces inside the planet as well as the five elemental forces.

As the Three Pure Ones are manifestations of Primordial Celestial Energy, they are formless. But to illustrate their role in Creation, they are often portrayed as elderly deities robed in the three basic colours from which all colours originated: Red, Blue and Yellow (or Green) depending on personal interpretation of colour origins by additive or subtractive means. Each of them holds onto a divine object associated with their task. Yuánshǐ Tiānzūn is usually depicted holding the Pearl of Creation, signifying his role in recreating the Universe. The Ruyi held by Lingbao Tianzun represents authority: the second phase of Creation where the Yang was separated from the Yin and the Law of Things was ordered in place. Lingbao Tianzun then took his seat on the left of Yuanshi Tianzun. Later, when all was complete, Daode Tianzun took his place on the right, with the fan symbolizing the completion of Creation, and the act of fanning representing the spreading of Tao to all Mankind.

== Syncretic beliefs ==
Some scholars believe depictions and theology of the Three Pure Ones from the Tang dynasty and after were influenced by Church of the East conception about the Trinity because of the heavy Christian-Taoist contact and mutual influence of the time.

Also, some believe that another Taoist trinity of gods evolved into the Pure Ones.

Beliefs in the Jade Emperor were taken from other Chinese religious traditions and he was seen as their assistant who managed all of creation.

==Yuanshi Tianzun==
Yuanshi Tianzun (, &quot;Lord of Primordial Beginning&quot; or the &quot;Primal Celestial One&quot;) is also known as the &quot;Jade Pure One&quot; () or &quot;Honoured Lord of the Origin&quot;.

==Lingbao Tianzun==
Lingbao Tianzun (, &quot;Lord of the Numinous Treasure&quot;) is also known as the &quot;Supreme Pure One&quot; (), &quot;The Universally Honoured One of Divinities and Treasures&quot;, or the &quot;Precious Celestial One&quot;.

In terms of worldview, the emergence of the Shàngqīng revelations signifies a major expansion of Taoism. Where the celestial masters had added the pure gods of the Tao to the popular pantheon, Shàngqīng enlarged this to include an entirely new layer of existence between the original, creative force of the Tao, represented by the deity &quot;yuan shi tian wang&quot; (heavenly king of primordial beginning), and created world as we know it. This celestial layer consisted of several different regions, located both in the far reaches of the world and in the stars, and imagined along the lines of the ancient paradises Penglai and Kunlun. It was populated by various divine figures: pure gods of the Tao who were emanations of original cosmic qi; immortals who had attained celestial status through effort and the proper elixir...

Lingbao Tianzun is associated with yin and yang and was responsible as the custodian of the sacred book. Lingbao Tianzun also calculates time and divides it into different epochs.

==Daode Tianzun==

Daode Tianzun (, &quot;Lord of the Way and its Virtue&quot;, &quot;Honoured Lord of the Tao and the Virtue&quot;, or &quot;[T]he Way-and-Its-Power Celestial One&quot;), also known as the &quot;Grand Pure One&quot; () or the &quot;Highest Elder Lord&quot; (, Taishang Laojun).

It is believed that Daode Tianzun manifested himself in the form of Laozi. Daode Tianzun is also the treasurer of spirits, known as the Lord of Man who is the founder of Taoism. He is the most eminent, aged ruler, which is why he is the only Pure One depicted with pure white hair and beard.

There seem to have been a number of stages in the process of Laozi&#x27;s eventual deification. First, the legendary figure began as a teacher and writer whose image eventually blended with that of the Yellow Emperor when Laozi came to be identified as a confidant of royalty. Traditional accounts, such as the life-story summarized earlier, transformed him into a cultural hero whose mother conceived him virginally. By the mid-second century C.E., Laozi had become the deity who delivered to Zhang Daoling the revelation of a new religious faith, giving rise to the Celestial Master&#x27;s school. His image was still not complete. Next, perhaps also around the second or third century CE, Laozi seems to have been identified as a creator god who also enters the world to rescue humanity from tribulation. Laozi was now capable of incarnating himself, almost like Buddhist bodhisattvas. Not long thereafter he joined the triad of the Three Pure Ones, and finally Laozi emerged as the chief divine person. We have here one of the more interesting examples of apotheosis, or deification, in the history of religion.

According to Daozang, Daode Tianzun had manifested many various incarnations to teach living beings, and Laozi is one of his incarnations.

He played college football for the Arizona State Sun Devils, and was selected by the Cowboys in the second round of the 1992 NFL draft with the 37th overall pick.

==Early life==
Woodson was raised by his mother, Freddie Luke, in Maryvale, a West Phoenix neighborhood.

==College career==
According to a January 23, 1996, article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, because Woodson failed to meet NCAA academic qualifications for a scholarship, he walked on at Arizona State University. According to the article, &quot;Woodson built a reputation as a ferocious hitter with a keen eye for football.&quot;

An undersized linebacker who wore #6 in college, Woodson was coached by ASU linebackers coach Lovie Smith, future NFL head coach.

As a sophomore in 1989, he was voted the team&#x27;s &quot;Most Improved&quot; player, after leading it in total tackles (122) and tackles for loss (5), including a 16 tackle game against Stanford University.

During his senior year, he showed his great athleticism by lining up during 2 games as a defensive end and playing on several occasions as an inside linebacker. Woodson finished his college career with 803 tackles and was invited to play on the Blue–Gray Football Classic.

A three-year starter at outside linebacker for the Sun Devils, Woodson earned honorable mention All-Pac-10 honors in 1989 and 1990, honorable mention All-America as a junior and All-Pac-10 second-team as a senior.

Seahawks head coach Mike Holmgren stated Jackson almost died in the locker room as medical personnel struggled to keep his airway open while he was having a seizure for 40 minutes. A spokesman for the Seahawks later stated Jackson was never in immediate danger of dying because his heart was beating and he continued to breathe. The spokesman also stated that Holmgren meant to convey that Jackson could have died.

On September 6, 2004, the Cowboys placed Woodson on their physically unable to participate list and he remained inactive for all 16 games.

===Retirement===
On December 29, 2004, Woodson officially announced his retirement from the NFL. He was the last remaining member of the Dallas Cowboys dynasty. He retired as the Dallas Cowboys&#x27; all-time leading tackler with 1,350 career tackles.

At the press conference to announce Woodson&#x27;s retirement, Parcells, then head coach of the Cowboys, said: &quot;[Woodson is] the kind of guy that makes this profession something that you like to engage in. He&#x27;s the epitome of a professional. He does epitomize that in every sense. What he did in playing and his approach to the game.&quot;

During his retirement press conference, Woodson said, &quot;When I put that helmet on, I laid it on the line. Not just for this team, but for everyone here. I laid it on the line every time I put that helmet on. I wanted to win so bad, that nothing else really mattered. The most important thing was giving everything I had each time I stepped out on the field. And I think I did that.&quot;

====Hall of Fame consideration====

In October 2008, Woodson became a first-time candidate on the Pro Football Hall of Fame&#x27;s preliminary list. In September 2011, he was included on the preliminary list of nominees for the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2012.

In February 2011, ESPN.com writer Tim MacMahon wrote that Woodson &quot;deserves serious Hall of Fame consideration and should join the Triplets on the modern side of the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor.&quot;

On August 4, 2015, the Dallas Cowboys announced that Woodson would be inducted into the Cowboys Ring of Honor. The official ceremony took place on November 1 against the Seahawks at AT&amp;T Stadium. Woodson is the eighth defensive player inducted into the Ring of Honor, and just the second who played in the 1990s era, along with Charles Haley.

==NFL career statistics==
==Style of play==
The only Cowboys player to suit up for both Jimmy Johnson and Bill Parcells, Woodson had a rare ability to play both the run and the pass. According to an article from July 3, 2009, on DallasCowboys.com, &quot;While Woodson delivered his share of big-time hits from the safety position, he was always the team&#x27;s slot cornerback, covering receivers inside, which is considered to be the toughest spot on the field. In today&#x27;s game, most teams put their best cover corner in the slot, but Woodson did that for years from the safety position. With that, it helped the Cowboys stop the run as well, having a safety that close to the line of scrimmage without being a liability in coverage.&quot;

In a December 30, 2004, article published in Knight Ridder newspapers, Clarence Hill described Woodson as &quot;the most versatile safety in the league and arguably the best in (Dallas Cowboys) history.&quot;

An October 31, 1994, article in Sports Illustrated described Woodson as &quot;a masher who doubles as an outside linebacker in passing situations&quot; and &quot;the most productive player on the best defense in the NFL.&quot; According to the author, &quot;A combination of strength, brute-force hitting and speed—4.35 seconds in the 40—makes Woodson the most versatile player on the Super Bowl champions.&quot;

Former Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson described Woodson as &quot;a player who could hit, tackle and take charge of a secondary. He did all those things with authority. He made his presence known on the football field, but played within the scheme and played smart.&quot;

He is generally regarded as the greatest safety in Cowboys history.

==Personal life==
Woodson has two sons, Darren Jr. and Jaden, and a daughter, Miranda from a previous marriage, and resides in Dallas, where he serves as a board member of Make a Wish Foundation (North Texas). On June 16, 2016, Jaden committed to play baseball at Texas. Since his retirement, Woodson has worked as a football analyst for ESPN, appearing on programs such as &quot;NFL Live&quot;, &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, and &quot;First Take&quot;.

Woodson grew up in Phoenix and was the youngest of four siblings raised by his mother, Freddie Luke. He was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers and admitted in a &quot;New York Times&quot; article he couldn&#x27;t stand the Cowboys. He decided to hit some golf balls while waiting to be drafted in 1992 and had his friend page him when he was selected. His friend told Woodson, &quot;There&#x27;s good news and bad news.&quot; Woodson asked for the bad news first and his friend replied &quot;You were drafted by the Cowboys.&quot; He replied &quot;I don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m just happy I was picked.&quot; Woodson was childhood friends with Phillippi Sparks and Kevin Miniefield and played alongside them at Arizona State. During his college career, he earned a degree in criminal justice at Arizona State.

In October 2011, Woodson became a founder of GuideHop, an online marketplace for guided tours and activities.

<doc id="412693" wikidata="Q6600935" url="?curid=412693" title="List of United States federal prisons">
<text>The Federal Bureau of Prisons classifies prisons into seven categories:

* United States penitentiaries
* Federal correctional institutions
* Private correctional institutions
* Federal prison camps
* Administrative facilities
* Federal correctional complexes
*Former Federal facilities

This list does not include military prisons, halfway houses, or prisons, jails, and other facilities operated by state or local governments that contract with the Federal Bureau of Prisons. It also does not include facilities operated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

== United States penitentiaries ==
Most United States penitentiaries (USPs) are high-security facilities, which have highly secured perimeters with walls or reinforced fences, multiple and single-occupant cell housing, the highest staff-to-inmate ratio, and close control of inmate movement. The most restrictive facility in the federal prison system is USP Florence ADMAX, the federal supermax prison, which holds inmates who are considered the most dangerous and in need of the tightest controls.

USP Leavenworth, USP Lewisburg, USP Lompoc, and USP Marion were originally operated as high-security facilities but have since been downgraded to medium-security facilities (former USP Lompoc has again been downgraded, to low-security). USP Atlanta, also a former high-security facility, is presently a low-security facility with the primary purpose of holding inmates until they are transferred to other institutions. In 2024, all former USP facilities were renamed to FCI facilities to more accurately reflect their security level. Many current USPs include minimum-security satellite camps on the same property and under the same administration as the higher-security units.

== Federal correctional institutions ==
Federal correctional institutions (FCIs) are medium- and low-security facilities, which have strengthened perimeters (often double fences with electronic detection systems), mostly cell-type housing, a wide variety of work and treatment programs. FCI Terre Haute contains a more restrictive section designated as a communication management unit for inmates considered high-security risks. FCI Marion contains one of two highly restrictive communication management units, which holds inmates under stricter controls.

== Private correctional institutions ==
In August 2016, Justice Department officials announced that the FBOP would be phasing out its use of contracted facilities, on the grounds that private prisons provide less safe and less effective services with no substantial cost savings. However, under the Trump administration in 2017, the Justice Department rescinded this phaseout, stating that it would re-implement its usage of private correctional facilities.

Most of these institutions are operated by the GEO Group, Inc., the exception being McRae Correctional Institution, operated by CoreCivic.

==Federal prison camps==
Federal prison camps (FPCs) are minimum-security facilities, which have dormitory housing, a relatively low staff-to-inmate ratio, and limited or no perimeter fencing. These institutions are work- and program-oriented. Many are located adjacent to larger institutions or on military bases, where inmates help serve the labor needs of the larger institution or base.

==Administrative facilities==
Administrative facilities are institutions with special missions, such as the detention of pretrial offenders; the treatment of inmates with serious or chronic medical problems; or the containment of extremely dangerous, violent, or escape-prone inmates. Administrative facilities include metropolitan correctional centers (MCCs), metropolitan detention centers (MDCs), federal detention centers (FDCs), federal medical centers (FMCs), the Federal Transfer Center (FTC), and the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners (MCFP), all of which are capable of holding inmates in all security categories.

==Former federal facilities==
This list enumerates facilities that were formerly owned by the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

<doc id="412696" wikidata="Q262059" url="?curid=412696" title="Elizabeth de Burgh">
<text>Elizabeth de Burgh ( ; – 27 October 1327) was the second wife and only queen consort of Robert the Bruce, King of Scots. Elizabeth was born sometime around 1289, probably in what is now County Down or County Antrim in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland.
She was the daughter of one of the most powerful Norman nobles in the Lordship of Ireland at that time, Richard Óg de Burgh, the 2nd Earl of Ulster, a member of the noble dynasty, the House of Burgh and a close friend and ally to King Edward I of England.

Not much is known about Elizabeth, despite her husband&#x27;s status as one of the most famous Scottish kings and warriors. As is the case with most medieval women, records of Elizabeth are scarce; however, it is clear that she was caught up in the political turmoil that unfolded between the Scottish and the English during the reign of her husband King Robert, had to move several times to keep safe and was eventually seized as a prisoner.

== Life ==

She was born in Ulster in the north of Ireland (c. 1289), the daughter of the powerful Richard Óg de Burgh, the lord of Ulster, and his wife, Margarite de Burgh (died 1304). Her father, Lord Ulster, was a close friend of King Edward I of England.

Elizabeth probably met Robert the Bruce, then Earl of Carrick, at the English court. They married in 1302 at Writtle, near Chelmsford in Essex, England, at which time Robert was a widower with a young daughter from his first marriage. Elizabeth would have been about 13 years old, and Robert 28.

On 27 March 1306, Robert and Elizabeth were crowned as King and Queen of Scots at Scone. The coronation took place in defiance of the English claims of suzerainty after Edward I stripped John de Baliol of the crown of Scotland. After his coronation, she is quoted as having said, as though fearing a defeat by Edward I.

== Capture ==

After the defeat of the Scots at the Battle of Methven on 19 June 1306, Robert sent Queen Elizabeth, his daughter Marjorie by his first marriage, and his sisters Mary and Christina to Kildrummy Castle, under the protection of his brother Niall (also known as Nigel). The English laid siege to the castle containing the royal party. The siege finally succeeded when the English bribed a blacksmith with &quot;all the gold he could carry&quot; to set fire to the grain store. The victors hanged, drew and quartered Niall Bruce, along with all the men from the castle. However, the royal ladies under the escort of The 9th Earl of Atholl had already fled.

They were taken from the sanctuary of St. Duthac at Tain by The Earl of Ross, a supporter of the Comyns, and dispatched to King Edward. He imprisoned Bruce&#x27;s sister Mary and Isabella, Countess of Buchan, in wooden cages erected on the walls of Roxburgh and Berwick castles respectively, and then sent Bruce&#x27;s nine-year-old daughter Marjorie to the nunnery at Watton.

Elizabeth was held under severe conditions of house arrest in England while Edward still needed aid from her father. The Earl of Atholl was hanged and his head displayed on London Bridge.

She was imprisoned for eight years by the English. From October 1306 to July 1308 she was held at Burstwick-in-Holderness, Yorkshire, where she, only served by two elder women, wrote a letter complaining about her condition (she had only 3 clothes and no headgear or linen bed clothing), before being transferred to Bisham Manor, Berkshire, until March 1312. From there, she was moved to Windsor Castle with six attendants and an allowance, where she was held until October 1312, Shaftesbury Abbey, Dorset, until March 1313, Barking Abbey, Essex, until March 1314, and Rochester Castle, Kent, until June 1314. After the Battle of Bannockburn, she was moved to York while prisoner exchange talks took place. At York, she had an audience with King Edward II of England. She was released in 1315 as part of the ransom for the Earl of Hereford who had been captured after the Battle of Bannockburn on 29 September 1314.

Queen Elizabeth had three children who reached adulthood: Matilda, Margaret, and David (the future King David II of Scotland).

== Death ==

Elizabeth died aged approximately 38 years old, on 27 October 1327, after falling from her horse during a visit to the royal residence at Cullen, Banffshire.

Plans were immediately made to transport her body to Dunfermline Abbey in Fife, the resting place of Scottish kings and queens since 1093. As parishioners in Cullen were worried that her remains would not arrive intact, they took the step of having her internal organs removed during the embalming process. While some sources claim that her entrails were transported separately to Fife, others state that they were buried in the parish church of Cullen. The parishioners also had Masses said to pray for her soul.

Robert, in gratitude for the treatment of Elizabeth&#x27;s body and its return south for burial, decreed that a chaplaincy be established at the Auld Kirk of Cullen (parish church of Cullen) and paid in perpetuity the sum of five Pound Scots to have Masses said for the soul of Elizabeth. Robert&#x27;s original bequest was augmented by Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1543 and continued to be paid by different bodies throughout the centuries until changes and loss of records due to local government reform in 1975, which led to the stopping of payments.
In 2011, the church&#x27;s minister, the Rev Melvyn Wood, applied to the Moray Council to have the tradition re-instated and, after a lengthy investigation, the Council agreed to reinstate the annual payment of £2.10 and even agreed to pay for the missed installments. A prayer is now said in the Queen&#x27;s honour at a Sunday service which also remembers parishioners who have died in the last year.

When King Robert died 18 months later, his body was laid to rest next to Elizabeth, who had been interred in the very centre of the abbey beneath the high altar, in an alabaster tomb decorated with gold leaf. Fragments of the tomb still remain and can be seen in the National Museum of Scotland. The abbey was sacked in 1560 by Calvinists during the Scottish Reformation and the tomb was lost. However, King Robert&#x27;s coffin was rediscovered in 1819 during construction work on the new abbey and Elizabeth&#x27;s coffin was rediscovered in 1917. Both were re-interred in the new abbey.

<text>Sing Sing Correctional Facility is a maximum-security prison for men operated by the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision in the village of Ossining, New York, United States. It is about north of Midtown Manhattan on the east bank of the Hudson River. It holds about 1,700 inmates as of 2007, and housed the execution chamber for the State of New York for a period, with the final execution there occurring in 1963; instead Green Haven Correctional Facility had the execution chamber by the late 20th Century. The total abolition of capital punishment in New York occurred in 2007.

The name &quot;Sing Sing&quot; derives from the Sintsink Native American tribe from whom the New York colony purchased the land in 1685, and was formerly the name of the village. In 1970, the prison&#x27;s name was changed to Ossining Correctional Facility, but it reverted to its original name in 1985. There are plans to convert the original 1825 cell block into a period museum.

The prison property is bisected by the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s four-track Hudson Line.

==History==

===Early years===

Sing Sing was the fifth prison constructed by New York state authorities. In 1824, the New York Legislature gave Elam Lynds, warden of Auburn Prison and a former United States Army captain, the task of constructing a new, more modern prison. Lynds spent months researching possible locations for the prison, considering Staten Island, the Bronx, and Silver Mine Farm, an area in the town of Mount Pleasant on the banks of the Hudson River.

By May, Lynds had decided to build a prison on Mount Pleasant, near (and thus named after) a small village in Westchester County named Sing Sing, whose name came from the Wappinger (Native American) words &quot;sinck sinck&quot;, which translates to &#x27;stone upon stone&#x27;. In March 1825, the legislature appropriated $20,100 to purchase the site, and the project received the official stamp of approval. Lynds selected 100 inmates from the Auburn prison for transfer and had them transported by barge via the Erie Canal and down the Hudson River to freighters. On their arrival on May 14, the site was &quot;without a place to receive them or a wall to enclose them&quot;; &quot;temporary barracks, a cook house, carpenter and blacksmith&#x27;s shops&quot; were rushed to completion.

When it was opened in 1826, it was considered a model prison because it turned a profit for the state. By October 1828, Sing Sing was completed. Lynds employed the Auburn system, which imposed absolute silence on the prisoners; the system was enforced by whipping and other punishments. 

John Luckey, the prison chaplain around 1843, reported Lynds&#x27; actions as warden to New York Governor William H. Seward and the president of the board of inspectors, John Edmonds in order to get him removed from his position. Luckey also created a religious library in the prison, with the purpose of teaching correct moral principles.

In 1844, the New York Prison Association was inaugurated to monitor state prison administration. The Association was made up of reformers interested in the rehabilitation of prisoners through humane treatment. Eliza Farnham obtained a position in charge of the women&#x27;s ward at Sing Sing largely on the recommendation of these reformers. She overturned the strictly silent practice in prison and introduced social engagement to shift concern more toward the future instead of dwelling on the criminal past. She included novels by Charles Dickens in Luckey&#x27;s religious library, novels the chaplain did not approve of. This was the first documented expansion of the prison library to include moral teachings from secular literature.

===After 1900===

Thomas Mott Osborne&#x27;s tenure as warden of Sing Sing was brief but dramatic. Osborne arrived in 1914 with a reputation as a radical prison reformer. His report of a week-long incognito stay inside New York&#x27;s Auburn Prison indicted traditional prison administration in merciless detail. During his time in Sing Sing he wrote his book &quot;Society and Prisons: Some Suggestions for a New Penology&quot;, which influenced the discussion of prison reform and contributed to a change in societal perceptions of incarcerated individuals. 

Prisoners who had bribed officers and intimidated other inmates lost their privileges under Osborne&#x27;s regime. One of them conspired with powerful political allies to destroy Osborne&#x27;s reputation, even succeeding in getting him indicted for a variety of crimes and maladministration. After Osborne triumphed in court, his return to Sing Sing was a cause for wild celebration by the inmates.

Another notable warden was Lewis Lawes. He was offered the position of warden in 1919, accepted in January 1920, and remained for 21 years as Sing Sing&#x27;s warden. While warden, Lawes brought about reforms and turned what was described as an &quot;old hellhole&quot; into a modern prison with sports teams, educational programs, new methods of discipline, and more. Several new buildings were constructed during the years Lawes was warden. Lawes retired in 1941 and died six years later.

In 1943, the old cellblock was closed and the metal bars and doors were donated to the war effort.
In 1989, the institution was accredited for the first time by the American Correctional Association, which established a set of national standards by which it judged every correctional facility. , Sing Sing houses approximately 1,500 inmates, employs about 900 people, and has hosted over 5,000 visitors per month. The original 1825 cell block is no longer used, and in 2002, plans were announced to turn it into a museum. In April 2011, there were talks of closing the prison to take advantage of its valuable real estate.

==Executions==


In total, 614 men and women – including four inmates under federal death sentences – were executed by electric chair at Sing Sing until the abolition of the death penalty in 1972. After a series of escapes from death row, a new Death House was built in 1920 and began executions in 1922. High-profile executions in Sing Sing&#x27;s electric chair, nicknamed &quot;Old Sparky&quot;, include Julius and Ethel Rosenberg on June 19, 1953, for espionage for the Soviet Union on nuclear weapon research; and Gerhard Puff on August 12, 1954, for the murder of an FBI agent. The last person executed in New York state was Eddie Lee Mays, for murder, on August 15, 1963.

In 1972, the United States Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; that the death penalty was unconstitutional if its application was inconsistent and arbitrary. This led to a temporary &quot;de facto&quot; nationwide moratorium (executions resumed in other states in 1977, and the death penalty was reinstated and abolished in New York in various forms over subsequent years ), but the electric chair at Sing Sing remained. In the early 1970s, the electric chair was moved to Green Haven Correctional Facility in working condition, but was never used again.

==Educational programs==
In 2013, Sing Sing Superintendent Michael Capra and NBC producer Dan Slepian worked with a group of 12 incarcerated men to start a program called &quot;Voices From Within&quot;, created by Jon-Adrian Velazquez in an effort to &quot;redefine what it means to pay a debt to society&quot;
Their first project was an emotional video about gun violence, where the men spoke directly to the youth in the communities from which they came. Slepian released the video in 2014 TEDxTalk at Sing Sing. The video is currently being used by various non-profits and law enforcement agencies to help prevent gun violence.

In 1996, Katherine Vockins founded Rehabilitation Through the Arts (RTA) at Sing Sing, enabling theater professionals to provide prisoners with a curriculum of year-round theater-related workshops. It has produced several plays at Sing Sing open to prisoners and community guests and has shown that the use of dramatic techniques leads to significant improvements in the cognitive behavior of the program&#x27;s participants and a reduction in recidivism once paroled. Its impact on social and institutional behavior was formally evaluated by the John Jay College for Criminal Justice, in collaboration with the NY State Department of Corrections. Led by Dr. Lorraine Moller, Professor of Speech and Drama at John Jay, the study found that it had a positive impact on prisoner Pavle Stanimirovic, one of the program&#x27;s first participants, that &quot;the longer the inmate was in the program, the fewer violations he committed.&quot; RTA currently operates at five other New York state prisons.

The Rehabilitation Through the Arts program is dramatized in the 2023 drama film &quot;Sing Sing&quot;, starring Colman Domingo alongside a cast of mainly real-life former inmates.

The organization Hudson Link for Higher Education in Prison provides college courses to incarcerated people to help reduce recidivism and poverty and strengthen families and communities. In 1998, as part of the get-tough-on-crime campaign, state and federal funding for college programs inside the prison was stopped. Understanding the positive effects of education in the transformation and rehabilitation of incarcerated people, inmates at Sing Sing Correctional Facility reached out to religious and academic volunteers to develop a college degree-granting program. Under Anne Reissner, Hudson Link for Higher Education in Prison was founded to restore college education at Sing Sing through private funding.

==Football team==

In 1931, new prison reforms permitted Sing Sing State Penitentiary prisoners to partake in recreation opportunities. The baseball and football teams, and the vaudeville presentations and concerts, were funded through revenue from paid attendance. Tim Mara, the owner of the New York Giants, sponsored the Sing Sing Black Sheep, Sing Sing&#x27;s football team. Mara provided equipment and uniforms and players to tutor them in fundamentals. He helped coach them the first season. Known as the Black Sheep, they were also sometimes called the Zebras. All games were &quot;home&quot; games, played at Lawes Stadium, named for Warden Lewis E. Lawes. In 1935, the starting quarterback and two other starters escaped the morning before a game.

Alabama Pitts was their starting quarterback and star for the first four seasons, but then finished his sentence. Upon release, Alabama Pitts played for the Philadelphia Eagles in 1935. In 1932, &quot;graduate&quot; Jumbo Morano was signed by the Giants and played for the Paterson Nighthawks of the Eastern Football League. In 1934, State Commissioner of Correction, Walter N. Thayer banned the advertising of activities at the prison, including football games. On November 19, 1936, a new rule banned ticket sales. No revenues could come from show and sports event ticketing. These funds had been paying for disbursements to prisoners&#x27; families, especially the kin of those executed, and for equipment and coaches&#x27; salaries. With this new edict, the season ended and prisoners were no longer allowed to play football outside Sing Sing.

==Museum==

Plans to turn a portion of Sing Sing into a museum date back to 2002, when local officials sought to turn the old powerhouse into the museum, linked by a tunnel to a retired cell block, for $5 million. In 2007, the village of Ossining applied for $12.5 million in federal money for the project, at the time expected to cost $14 million. The proposed museum would display the Sing Sing story as it unfolded over time.

==Contribution to American English==
The expression &quot;up the river&quot; to describe someone in prison or heading to prison derives from the practice of sentencing people convicted in New York City to serve their terms in Sing Sing prison, which is located up the Hudson River from the city. The slang expression dates from 1891.

<doc id="412702" wikidata="Q310890" url="?curid=412702" title="Monotypic taxon">
<text>In biology, a monotypic taxon is a taxonomic group (taxon) that contains only one immediately subordinate taxon. A monotypic species is one that does not include subspecies or smaller, infraspecific taxa. In the case of genera, the term &quot;unispecific&quot; or &quot;monospecific&quot; is sometimes preferred. In botanical nomenclature, a monotypic genus is a genus in the special case where a genus and a single species are simultaneously described.

==Theoretical implications==

Monotypic taxa present several important theoretical challenges in biological classification. One key issue is known as &quot;Gregg&#x27;s Paradox&quot;: if a single species is the only member of multiple hierarchical levels (for example, being the only species in its genus, which is the only genus in its family), then each level needs a distinct definition to maintain logical structure. Otherwise, the different taxonomic ranks become effectively identical, which creates problems for organizing biological diversity in a hierarchical system.

When taxonomists identify a monotypic taxon, this often reflects uncertainty about its relationships rather than true evolutionary isolation. This uncertainty is evident in many cases across different species. For instance, the diatom &quot;Licmophora juergensii&quot; is placed in a monotypic genus because scientists have not yet found clear evidence of its relationships to other species.

Some taxonomists argue against monotypic taxa because they reduce the information content of biological classifications. As taxonomists Backlund and Bremer explain in their critique, &quot;&#x27;Monotypic&#x27; taxa do not provide any information about the relationships of the immediately subordinate taxon&quot;. When monotypic taxa are sister to a single larger group, they might be merged into that group; however, when they are sister to multiple other groups, they may need to remain separate to maintain a natural classification.

From a cladistic perspective, which focuses on shared derived characteristics to determine evolutionary relationships, the theoretical status of monotypic taxa is complex. Some argue they can only be justified when relationships cannot be resolved through synapomorphies (shared derived characteristics); otherwise, they would necessarily exclude related species and thus be paraphyletic. However, others contend that while most taxonomic groups can be classified as either monophyletic (containing all descendants of a common ancestor) or paraphyletic (excluding some descendants), these concepts do not apply to monotypic taxa because they contain only a single member.

Monotypic taxa are part of a broader challenge in biological classification known as &quot;aphyly&quot; – situations where evolutionary relationships are poorly supported by evidence. This includes both monotypic groups and cases where traditional groupings are found to be artificial. Understanding how monotypic taxa fit into this bigger picture helps identify areas needing further research.

The German lichenologist Robert Lücking suggests that the common application of the term monotypic is frequently misleading, &quot;since each taxon by definition contains exactly one type and is hence &quot;monotypic&quot;, regardless of the total number of units&quot;, and suggests using &quot;monospecific&quot; for a genus with a single species, and &quot;monotaxonomic&quot; for a taxon containing only one unit.

==Conservation implications==

Species in monotypic genera tend to be more threatened with extinction than average species. Studies have found this pattern particularly pronounced in amphibians, where about 6.56% of monotypic genera are critically endangered, compared to birds and mammals where around 4.54% and 4.02% of monotypic genera face critical endangerment respectively.

Studies have found that extinction of monotypic genera is particularly associated with island species. Among 25 documented extinct monotypic genera studied, 22 occurred on islands, with flightless animals being particularly vulnerable to human impacts.

==Examples==
Just as the term &quot;monotypic&quot; is used to describe a taxon including only one subdivision, the contained taxon can also be referred to as monotypic within the higher-level taxon, e.g. a genus monotypic within a family. Some examples of monotypic groups are:

===Plants===
* In the order Amborellales, there is only one family, Amborellaceae, and there is only one genus, &quot;Amborella&quot;, and in this genus there is only one species, &quot;Amborella trichopoda.&quot;
* The flowering plant &quot;Breonadia salicina&quot; is the only species in the monotypic genus &quot;Breonadia&quot;.
* The family Cephalotaceae includes only one genus, &quot;Cephalotus&quot;, and only one species, &quot;Cephalotus follicularis&quot; – the Albany pitcher plant.
* The division Ginkgophyta is monotypic, containing the single class Ginkgoopsida. This class is also monotypic, containing the single order Ginkgoales.
* &quot;Picomonas judraskeda&quot; is the only known species in the division &quot;Picozoa&quot;.

===Animals===
* The madrone butterfly is the only species in the monotypic genus &quot;Eucheira&quot;. However, there are two subspecies of this butterfly, &quot;E. socialis socialis&quot; and &quot;E. socialis westwoodi&quot;, which means the species &quot;E. socialis&quot; is not monotypic.
* &quot;Erithacus rubecula&quot;, the European robin, is the only extant member of its genus.
* &quot;Delphinapterus leucas&quot; or the beluga whale is the only member of its genus and lacks subspecies.
* &quot;Dugong dugon&quot; is the only species in the monotypic genus &quot;Dugong&quot;.
* &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; (humans) are monotypic, as they have too little genetic diversity to harbor any living subspecies.
* &quot;Limnognathia maerski&quot; is a microscopic animal and the only species in the monotypic phylum &quot;Micrognathozoa&quot;.
* The narwhal is a medium-sized cetacean that is the only member of the monotypic genus &quot;Monodon&quot;.
* The platypus is the only member of the monotypic genus &quot;Ornithorhynchus&quot;.
* The &quot;salamanderfish&quot; is the only member of the order Lepidogalaxiiformes, which is the sister group to the remaining euteleosts.
* &quot;Ozichthys albimaculosus&quot;, the cream-spotted cardinalfish, found in tropical Australia and southern New Guinea, is the type species of the monotypic genus &quot;Ozichthys&quot;.
* The bearded reedling is the only species in the monotypic genus &quot;Panurus&quot;, which is the only genus in the monotypic family Panuridae.
* Canines form the only living subfamily of the dog family, Canidae

<doc id="412703" wikidata="Q1420151" url="?curid=412703" title="Cosmic egg">
<text>The cosmic egg, world egg or mundane egg is a mythological motif found in the cosmogonies of many cultures and civilizations, including in Proto-Indo-European mythology. Typically, there is an egg which, upon &quot;hatching&quot;, either gives rise to the universe itself or gives rise to a primordial being who, in turn, creates the universe. The egg is sometimes lain on the primordial waters of the Earth. Typically, the upper half of the egg, or its outer shell, becomes the heaven (firmament) and the lower half, or the inner yolk, becomes the Earth. The motif likely stems from simple elements of an egg, including its ability to offer nourishment and give rise to new life, as is reflected by the Latin proverb &quot;omne vivum ex ovo&quot; (&#x27;all life comes from an egg&#x27;).

The term &quot;cosmic egg&quot; is also used in the modern study of cosmology in the context of emergent Universe scenarios.

== Chinese mythology ==
Various versions of the cosmic egg myth are related to the creator, Pangu. Heaven and earth are said to have originally existed in a formless state, like the egg of a chicken. The egg opens and unfolds after 18,000 years: the light part rose to become heaven and the heavy part sank to become the earth. A version of this myth deriving from the Zhejiang Province holds that Pangu, experiencing discomfort in being contained in a dark and stuffy egg, shatters it into pieces, after which heaven and earth form by the same process (with the addition that parts of the shell then form the sun, moon, and stars).

== Dogon mythology ==
In Dogon mythology from Burkina Faso, the creator-god Amma takes the form of an egg. The egg is divided into four sections representing the four elements: air, fire, water, and earth. This also establishes the four cardinal directions. Failing to create the Earth on her first attempt, Amma plants a seed in herself that forms two placentas, each containing a pair of twins. One twin, Ogo, breaks out and unsuccessfully tries to create a universe. Amma however is able to create the Earth now from a part of Ogo&#x27;s placenta. Ogo&#x27;s twin, Nommo, is killed by Amma and parts of the body are scattered across the world to give it order. The parts were then reconstituted to revive Nommo. Nommo creates four spirits that become the ancestors of the Dogon people. These spirits are sent with Nommo into an ark to populate the world.

The creation account proceeds as follows:In the beginning, Amma dogon, alone, was in the shape of an egg: the four collar bones were fused, dividing the egg into air, earth, fire, and water, establishing also the four cardinal directions. Within this cosmic egg was the material and the structure of the universe, and the 266 signs that embraced the essence of all things. The first creation of the world by Amma was, however, a failure. The second creation began when Amma planted a seed within herself, a seed that resulted in the shape of man. But in the process of its gestation, there was a flaw, meaning that the universe would now have within it the possibilities for incompleteness. Now the egg became two placentas, each containing a set of twins, male and female. After sixty years, one of the males, Ogo, broke out of the placenta and attempted to create his own universe, in opposition to that being created by Amma. But he was unable to say the words that would bring such a universe into being. He then descended, as Amma transformed into the earth the fragment of placenta that went with Ogo into the void. Ogo interfered with the creative potential of the earth by having incestuous relations with it. His counterpart, Nommo, a participant in the revolt, was then killed by Amma, the parts of his body cast in all directions, bringing a sense of order to the world. When, five days later, Amma brought the pieces of Nommo&#x27;s body together, restoring him to life, Nommo became ruler of the universe. He created four spirits, the ancestors of the Dogon people; Amma sent Nommo and the spirits to earth in an ark, and so the earth was restored. Along the way, Nommo uttered the words of Amma, and the sacred words that create were made available to humans. In the meantime, Ogo was transformed by Amma into Yuguru, the Pale Fox, who would always be alone, always be incomplete, eternally in revolt, ever wandering the earth seeking his female soul. 

== Egyptian mythology ==
The ancient Egyptians accepted multiple creation myths as valid, including those of the Hermopolitan, Heliopolitan, and Memphite theologies. The cosmic egg myth can be found from Hermopolitus. Although the site, located in Middle Egypt, currently sports a name deriving from the name of the god Hermes, the ancient Egyptians called it Khemnu, or “Eight-Town.” The number eight, in turn, refers to the Ogdoad, a group of eight gods who are the main characters in the Hermopolitan creation myth. Four of these gods are male, and have the heads of frogs, and the other four are female with the heads of serpents. These eight existed in the primordial, chaotic water that pre-existed the rest of creation. At some point these eight gods, in one way or another, bring about the formation of a cosmic egg, although variants of the myth describe the origins of the egg in different ways. In any case, the egg in turn gives rise to the deity who forms the rest of the world as well as the first land to arise out of the primordial waters, called the primeval mound. When the mound appeared, a lotus blossom bloomed to signal the birth of the sun god, after which the formation of the rest of creation could finally proceed.

== Greek and Roman mythology ==
Ideas similar to the cosmic egg myth are mentioned in two different sources from Greek and Roman mythology. One is in the Roman author Marcus Terentius Varro, living in the 1st century BC. According to Varro, heaven and earth can respectively be likened to an egg shell and its yolk. The air, in turn, is represented by the moisture functioning as a form of humidity between the shell and yolk. The second mention is found in the Pseudo-Clementine Recognitions 10:17, although from an oppositional standpoint, insofar as Clement is presented as summarizing a ridiculous cosmological belief found among pagans: according to the description given, there is a primordial chaos which, over time, solidified into an egg. As is with an egg, a creature began to grow inside, until at some point it broke open to produce a human that was both male and female (i.e. androgynous) named Phanetas. When Phanetas appeared, a light shone forth that resulted in &quot;substance, prudence, motion, and coition,&quot; and these in turn resulted in the creation of the heavens and the earth. The Recognitions 10:30 presents, then, a second summary of the idea, this time attributed to the cosmogony of Orpheus as described by a &quot;good pagan&quot; named Niceta. This summary, in contrast to the first one, is presented in a serious manner. This myth appears to have had occasional influence, insofar as a manuscript of it is associated with the reappearance of the idea at a library of Saint Gall in a 9th-century commentary on Boethius. Another three appearances occur again in the twelfth century.

== Hindu mythology ==
In one Vedic myth recorded in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, the earliest phase of the cosmos involves a primordial ocean out of which an egg arose. Once the egg split, it began the process of forming heaven (out of the upper part) and earth (out of the lower part) over the course of one hundred divine years. Another text, the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, also has the sequence of a primordial ocean and then an egg, but this time, the god Prajapati emerges from the egg after one year. He creates the cosmos and then the gods and antigods from his speech and breath. The Rigveda speaks of a golden embryo (called the &quot;hiraṇyagarbha&quot;) which is located on a &quot;high waters&quot; out of which all else develops. Finally, a version of the story appears in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad.

== Finnish mythology ==

In the Kalevala, the national epic of Finland, there is a myth of the world being created from the fragments of an egg. The goddess of the air, Ilmatar, longed to have a son. To achieve this, she and the East Wind make love until she conceives Väinämöinen, the child of the wind. However, she was not able to give birth to her child. A pochard swooped down and impregnated her: as a result, six golden cosmic eggs were birthed or laid, as well as an iron egg. The pochard took these eggs for himself and protected them by sitting on them, but this came with sitting on Ilmatar as well. Upon the movement of the air goddess, they rolled into the sea and the shell broke: the fragments formed heaven, earth, the sun, moon, stars, and (from the iron egg) a thundercloud.

The following is the translation of the part of the text describing the formation of the cosmos from the fragments of the egg, published by William Forsell Kirby in 1906:

: In the ooze they were not wasted,
: Nor the fragments in the water,
: But a wondrous change came o&#x27;er them,
: And the fragments all grew lovely.
: From the cracked egg&#x27;s lower fragment,
: Now the solid earth was fashioned,
: From the cracked egg&#x27;s upper fragment,
: Rose the lofty arch of heaven,
: From the yolk, the upper portion,
: Now became the sun&#x27;s bright lustre;
: From the white, the upper portion,
: Rose the moon that shines so brightly;
: Whatso in the egg was mottled,
: Now became the stars in heaven,
: Whatso in the egg was blackish,
: In the air as cloudlets floated.

== Zoroastrian mythology ==
In Zoroastrian cosmography, the sky was considered to be spherical with an outer boundary (called a &quot;parkān&quot;), an idea that likely goes back to Sumerians. The Earth is also spherical and exists within the spherical sky. To help convey this cosmology, a number of ancient writers, including Empedocles, came up with the analogy of an egg: the outer spherical and bounded sky is like the outer shell, whereas the Earth is represented by the inner round yolk within. This analogy, in turn, is found in a number of Zoroastrian texts, including the Selections of Zadspram.

== Modern representations ==

=== Literature ===
In 1955 poet and writer Robert Graves published the mythography &quot;The Greek Myths&quot;, a compendium of Greek mythology normally published in two volumes. Within this work Graves&#x27; imaginatively reconstructed &quot;Pelasgian creation myth&quot; features a supreme creatrix, Eurynome, &quot;The Goddess of All Things&quot;, who arose naked from Chaos to part sea from sky so that she could dance upon the waves. Catching the north wind at her back and, rubbing it between her hands, she warms the &quot;pneuma&quot; and spontaneously generates the serpent Ophion, who mates with her. In the form of a dove upon the waves, she lays the Cosmic Egg and bids Ophion to incubate it by coiling seven times around until it splits in two and hatches &quot;all things that exist... sun, moon, planets, stars, the earth with its mountains and rivers, its trees, herbs, and living creatures&quot;.
=== Film ===
The ending of Stanley Kubrick’s film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; depicts the rebirth of humanity as a journey from beyond infinity back to earth in the form of a cosmic human embryo (or “Star Child”).

=== Cosmology ===
As the concept of a true singularity came under increasing criticism, alternative nonsingular &quot;cosmic egg&quot; (emergent Universe) scenarios started being developed.

* In 1913, Vesto Slipher published his observations that light from remote galaxies was redshifted, which was gradually accepted as meaning that all galaxies (except Andromeda) are receding from the Earth.

* Alexander Friedmann predicted the same consequence in 1922 from Einstein&#x27;s equations of general relativity, once the previous ad-hoc cosmological constant was removed from it (which had been inserted to conform to the preconceived eternal, static universe).
* Georges Lemaître proposed in 1927 that the cosmos originated from what he called the &quot;primeval atom&quot;.
* Edwin Hubble observationally confirmed Lemaître&#x27;s findings two years later, in 1929.

* In the late 1940s, George Gamow&#x27;s assistant cosmological researcher Ralph Alpher, proposed the name ylem for the primordial substance that existed between the Big Crunch of the previous universe and the Big Bang of our own universe. &quot;Ylem&quot; is closely related to the concept of supersymmetry.

<doc id="412707" wikidata="Q814025" url="?curid=412707" title="Beechcraft T-6 Texan II">
<text>The Beechcraft T-6 Texan II is a single-engine turboprop aircraft built by Textron Aviation. It is a license-built Pilatus PC-9, a trainer aircraft. The T-6 replaced the United States Air Force&#x27;s Cessna T-37B Tweet and the United States Navy&#x27;s T-34C Turbo Mentor during the 2010s.

The T-6A is used by the United States Air Force for basic pilot training and Combat Systems Officer (CSO) training, the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps for primary Naval Aviator training and primary and intermediate Naval Flight Officer (NFO) training, and by the Royal Canadian Air Force (CT-156 Harvard II designation), Greek Air Force, Israeli Air Force (with the &quot;Efroni&quot; nickname), and Iraqi Air Force for basic flight training. The T-6B is the primary trainer for U.S. student naval aviators (SNAs). The T-6C is used for training by the Mexican Air Force, Royal Air Force, Royal Moroccan Air Force, and the Royal New Zealand Air Force.

==Design and development==
The Model 3000/T-6 is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with enclosed tandem seating for two. It is powered by a single Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-68 turboprop engine in tractor configuration with an aluminum, , four-blade, constant-speed, variable pitch, non-reversing, feathering propeller assembly and has retractable tricycle landing gear. The aircraft is fitted with Martin-Baker Mark 16 ejection seats and a canopy fracturing system.

The T-6 is a development of the Pilatus PC-9, modified by Beechcraft to enter the Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) competition in the 1990s. A similar arrangement between Pilatus and British Aerospace had also been in place for a Royal Air Force competition in the 1980s, although that competition selected the Short Tucano. The aircraft was designated under the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system and named for the decades-earlier T-6 Texan.

On 9 April 2007, the U.S. Department of Defense released their Selected Acquisition Reports, which reported that the T-6 JPATS program was one of only eight programs cited for Congressional notification for 25–50% cost overrun over initial estimates, which is referred to as a &quot;Nunn-McCurdy Breach&quot; after the Nunn-McCurdy Amendment. It is unusual for a program so far into full-rate production to experience significant enough cost overruns to trigger this congressional notification.

== Incidents ==

* May 13, 2024: U.S. Air Force flight instructor died after sustaining critical injuries when the ejection seat in his T-6 Texan II activated while the aircraft was on the ground.
* July 27, 2022: The U.S. military grounded hundreds of T-6 Texan IIs after concerns about a potential defect in the cartridge actuated devices (CAD) used to initiate the plane&#x27;s ejection seats.
* October 23, 2020: Navy LT Rhiannon Ross and Coast Guard ENS Morgan Garrett died on impact when they crashed their T-6 in a residential area near Foley, Alabama. Causes for the accident were unclear.
* September 18, 2018: A T-6 Texan crashed on landing due to an incorrectly assembled engine. Both pilots were able to eject safely.

==Operational history==
===United States===
The T-6A was introduced to Moody Air Force Base and Randolph Air Force Base in 2000–2001, and the Air Force awarded the full-rate T-6 production contract in December 2001. Laughlin Air Force Base began flying the T-6 in 2003 where it became the primary basic trainer, replacing the T-37. Vance Air Force Base completed transitioning from the T-37 to the T-6 in 2006. That year, Columbus Air Force Base began its transition, and retired its last T-37 in April 2008. The last active USAF T-37Bs were retired at Sheppard Air Force Base in the summer of 2009.

The Texan failed to qualify for the Light Attack/Armed Reconnaissance program, because the USAF mailed the exclusion notice to the wrong address, leaving the company with no time to protest the decision. But the official mail failure gave Hawker-Beechcraft a further legal justification, as they had told the USAF they planned to file a legal challenge even before the official notice had been mailed and brought its considerable political influence to bear against the USAF decision against their candidate with one Kansas Congressman stating, &quot;It is simply wrong for the Obama administration to hire a Brazilian company to handle national security when we have a qualified and competent American company that can do the job.&quot; In 2013, Beechcraft again lost the bid.

In August 2017, the Air Force conducted the &quot;Light Attack Experiment&quot; to evaluate potential light attack aircraft. Following this, it decided to continue experimenting with two non-developmental aircraft, the AT-6 Wolverine derivative of the T-6 Texan II and the Sierra Nevada/Embraer A-29 Super Tucano. Tests were scheduled to be conducted at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona between May and July 2018. The tests are intended &quot;to experiment with maintenance, data networking and sensors...[to] gather the data needed for a rapid procurement&quot;, according to Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson. Experimentation will examine logistics requirements, weapons and sensor issues, and future interoperability with partner forces.

During the last week of January 2018, a cluster of unexplained physiological events involving the T-6 occurred at Columbus, Vance, and Sheppard Air Force Bases. In response, the commander of Nineteenth Air Force, which is responsible for USAF pilot training, directed an &quot;operational pause&quot; in Texan II operations on 1 February 2018 to ensure aircrew safety. The pause was intended to enable the Air Force to &quot;examine the root causes of the incidents, educate and listen to aircrew, develop and deliver mitigation solutions.&quot; The Air Force had established a general officer-led team to integrate and coordinate efforts across the Air Force to address aircrew unexplained physiological events earlier in 2018.

In February 2018, the AT-6 Wolverine and the A-29 Super Tucano were named as the only two remaining aircraft in USAF&#x27;s Light Attack/Armed Reconnaissance aircraft competition.

In March 2020, the USAF placed a $70.2 million order for two AT-6E Wolverine aircraft. The first Wolverine was delivered to the USAF in February 2021. The Wolverines were operated by the 81st Fighter Squadron. In June 2022, the two aircraft were returned to Beechcraft. In July 2022, the Wolverine received Military Type Certification from the USAF. In September 2023, the two Wolverines were transferred from storage at Beechcraft to the United States Naval Test Pilot School.

===Canada===
The CT-156 Harvard II is a variant used for pilot instruction in the NATO Flying Training in Canada (NFTC), located at 15 Wing, Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. They are leased to the Royal Canadian Air Force by the program&#x27;s administrator, CAE. NFTC&#x27;s Harvard II aircraft are almost identical in cockpit layout and performance to the American JPATS Texan IIs. Within NFTC, students fly the Harvard II in Phase 2 and 3 of the training program, and some will go on to fly the CT-155 Hawk jet trainer also used by NFTC for Phase 4 (Moose Jaw) and Phase 5 Fighter Lead-In Training (4 Wing, Cold Lake, Alberta). NFTC had 25 Harvard II aircraft owned and maintained by Bombardier, although one was lost following a non-fatal crash in 2014, and another in 2017. CAE took over the program in 2015.

===Greece===
The Hellenic Air Force operates 25 T-6A and 20 T-6A NTA aircraft.

===Israel===
On 9 June 2008, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced a possible FMS sale to Israel of 25 T-6As for the Israeli Air Force. In July 2009, Beechcraft delivered the first four of 20 T-6As under contract to the Israeli Air Force.

===Iraq===
On 16 December 2009, the first four of 15 T-6A aircraft were delivered to Tikrit, Iraq under a $210 million contract. No AT-6 aircraft were included as was previously reported. The last four T-6As reached Iraq on 9 November 2010.

On 13 May 2014, the US State Department approved an order for 24 T-6C aircraft for use as trainers by the Iraqi Air Force. The sale was worth US$790 million and was part of a larger one billion dollar deal.

===Morocco===
In October 2009, Hawker Beechcraft announced the sale of 24 T-6Cs for the Royal Moroccan Air Force.

===Mexico===
On 9 January 2012, Mexico purchased six T-6C+ aircraft for the Mexican Air Force to begin replacing their Pilatus PC-7 trainers. On 24 October 2013, Hawker Beechcraft announced a follow-on order of an additional six T-6C+ aircraft for the Mexican Air Force, bringing the total ordered to 12. The Mexican Navy also ordered two T-6C+ Trainers in March 2014.

===New Zealand===

The New Zealand Government announced the purchase of 11 T-6Cs for the Royal New Zealand Air Force for NZ$154 million, on 27 January 2014 to replace the PAC CT/4 Airtrainer, with all aircraft delivered by February 2015. The first training course using the type began early 2016. The T-6Cs are expected to remain in service with the RNZAF for 30 years.

===United Kingdom===
On 24 October 2014, the UK Ministry of Defence announced its preferred bidder for the UK Military Flying Training System programme. Ascent&#x27;s system will involve T-6C Texan IIs in the basic trainer role for both Royal Air Force and Royal Navy pilots. The contract for ten aircraft was signed by Affinity Flying Training Services and Beechcraft Defense on 4 February 2016. The T-6C trainers have replaced Shorts Tucano T1 aircraft.

===Argentina===
In October 2017, the Argentine Air Force received the first four of 12 T-6C+ aircraft purchased from Textron Aviation and a further two in June 2018.

===Tunisia===
In October 2019, U.S. State Department approved the possible Foreign Military Sale of 12 T-6Cs to Tunisia at an estimated cost of $234 million (~$ in ), including related spares, ground support equipment, and support. The sale is intended to provide replacement for the aging trainer fleet of Tunisian Air Force and to train pilots for counter-terrorism and border security missions.

<doc id="412708" wikidata="Q82029" url="?curid=412708" title="Henstock–Kurzweil integral">
<text>In mathematics, the Henstock–Kurzweil integral or generalized Riemann integral or gauge integral – also known as the (narrow) Denjoy integral (), Luzin integral or Perron integral, but not to be confused with the more general wide Denjoy integral – is one of a number of inequivalent definitions of the integral of a function. It is a generalization of the Riemann integral, and in some situations is more general than the Lebesgue integral. In particular, a function is Lebesgue integrable over a subset of formula_1 if and only if the function and its absolute value are Henstock–Kurzweil integrable.

This integral was first defined by Arnaud Denjoy (1912). Denjoy was interested in a definition that would allow one to integrate functions like:

formula_2

This function has a singularity at 0, and is not Lebesgue-integrable. However, it seems natural to calculate its integral except over the interval formula_3 and then let formula_4.

Trying to create a general theory, Denjoy used transfinite induction over the possible types of singularities, which made the definition quite complicated. Other definitions were given by Nikolai Luzin (using variations on the notions of absolute continuity), and by Oskar Perron, who was interested in continuous major and minor functions. It took a while to understand that the Perron and Denjoy integrals are actually identical.

Later, in 1957, the Czech mathematician Jaroslav Kurzweil discovered a new definition of this integral, elegantly similar in nature to Riemann&#x27;s original definition, which Kurzweil named the gauge integral. In 1961 Ralph Henstock independently introduced a similar integral that extended the theory, citing his investigations of Ward&#x27;s extensions to the Perron integral. Due to these two important contributions it is now commonly known as the Henstock–Kurzweil integral. The simplicity of Kurzweil&#x27;s definition made some educators advocate that this integral should replace the Riemann integral in introductory calculus courses.

==Definition==
Following , given a tagged partition formula_5 of formula_6, that is,formula_7
together with each subinterval&#x27;s tag defined as a point
formula_8
we define the Riemann sum for a function formula_9 to be
formula_10
where formula_11 This is the summation of each subinterval&#x27;s length multiplied by the function evaluated at that subinterval&#x27;s tag .

Given a positive function
formula_12
which we call a &quot;gauge&quot;, we say a tagged partition &quot;P &quot;is formula_13-fine if
formula_14

We now define a number to be the Henstock–Kurzweil integral of if for every there exists a gauge formula_13 such that whenever is formula_13-fine, we have
formula_17

If such an exists, we say that is Henstock–Kurzweil integrable on formula_6.

Cousin&#x27;s theorem states that for every gauge formula_13, such a formula_13-fine partition &quot;P&quot; does exist, so this condition cannot be satisfied vacuously. The Riemann integral can be regarded as the special case where we only allow constant gauges.

==Properties==

Let formula_21 be any function.

Given formula_22, formula_23 is Henstock–Kurzweil integrable on formula_6 if and only if it is Henstock–Kurzweil integrable on both formula_25 and formula_26; in which case ,formula_27

Henstock–Kurzweil integrals are linear: given integrable functions formula_23 and formula_29 and real numbers formula_30 and formula_31, the expression formula_32 is integrable ; for example,formula_33

If &quot;f&quot; is Riemann or Lebesgue integrable, then it is also Henstock–Kurzweil integrable, and calculating that integral gives the same result by all three formulations. The important Hake&#x27;s theorem states thatformula_34

whenever either side of the equation exists, and likewise symmetrically for the lower integration bound. This means that if formula_23 is &quot;improperly Henstock–Kurzweil integrable&quot;, then it is properly Henstock–Kurzweil integrable; in particular, improper Riemann or Lebesgue integrals of types such asformula_36

are also proper Henstock–Kurzweil integrals. To study an &quot;improper Henstock–Kurzweil integral&quot; with finite bounds would not be meaningful. However, it does make sense to consider improper Henstock–Kurzweil integrals with infinite bounds such as
formula_37

For many types of functions the Henstock–Kurzweil integral is no more general than Lebesgue integral. For example, if is bounded with compact support, the following are equivalent:
* is Henstock–Kurzweil integrable,
* is Lebesgue integrable,
* is Lebesgue measurable.
In general, every Henstock–Kurzweil integrable function is measurable, and formula_23 is Lebesgue integrable if and only if both formula_23 and formula_40 are Henstock–Kurzweil integrable. This means that the Henstock–Kurzweil integral can be thought of as a &quot;non-absolutely convergent version of the Lebesgue integral&quot;. It also implies that the Henstock–Kurzweil integral satisfies appropriate versions of the monotone convergence theorem (without requiring the functions to be nonnegative) and dominated convergence theorem (where the condition of dominance is loosened to for some integrable &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;).

If formula_41 is differentiable everywhere (or with countably many exceptions), the derivative formula_42 is Henstock–Kurzweil integrable, and its indefinite Henstock–Kurzweil integral is formula_41. (Note that formula_42 need not be Lebesgue integrable.) In other words, we obtain a simpler and more satisfactory version of the second fundamental theorem of calculus: each differentiable function is, up to a constant, the integral of its derivative:formula_45

Conversely, the Lebesgue differentiation theorem continues to hold for the Henstock–Kurzweil integral: if formula_23 is Henstock–Kurzweil integrable on formula_6, and

formula_48

then formula_49 almost everywhere in formula_6 (in particular, formula_41 is differentiable almost everywhere).

The space of all Henstock–Kurzweil-integrable functions is often endowed with the Alexiewicz norm, with respect to which it is barrelled but incomplete.

==Utility==
The gauge integral has increased utility when compared to the Riemann Integral in that the gauge integral of any function formula_52 which has a constant value &quot;c&quot; except possibly at a countable number of points formula_53 can be calculated. Consider for example the piecewise functionformula_54
which is equal to one minus the Dirichlet function on the interval.

This function is impossible to integrate using a Riemann integral because it is impossible to make intervals formula_55 small enough to encapsulate the changing values of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) with the mapping nature of formula_13-fine tagged partitions.

The value of the type of integral described above is equal to formula_57, where &quot;c&quot; is the constant value of the function, and &quot;a, b&quot; are the function&#x27;s endpoints. To demonstrate this, let formula_58 be given and let formula_59 be a formula_13-fine tagged partition of formula_61 with tags formula_62 and intervals formula_63, and let formula_64 be the piecewise function described above. Consider that 
formula_65
where formula_66 represents the length of interval formula_63. Note this equivalence is established because the summation of the consecutive differences in length of all intervals formula_63 is equal to the length of the interval (or formula_69).

By the definition of the gauge integral, we want to show that the above equation is less than any given formula_70. This produces two cases:

Case 1: formula_71 (All tags of formula_72 are irrational):

If none of the tags of the tagged partition formula_72 are rational, then formula_74 will always be 1 by the definition of formula_64, meaning formula_76. If this term is zero, then for any interval length, the following inequality will be true:
formula_77

So for this case, 1 is the integral of formula_64.

Case 2: formula_79 (Some tag of formula_72 is rational):

If a tag of formula_72 is rational, then the function evaluated at that point will be 0, which is a problem. Since we know formula_72 is formula_13-fine, the inequality 
formula_84 
holds because the length of any interval formula_63 is shorter than its covering by the definition of being formula_13-fine. If we can construct a gauge formula_13 out of the right side of the inequality, then we can show the criteria are met for an integral to exist.

To do this, let formula_88 and set our covering gauges formula_89, which makes 
formula_90

From this, we have that 
formula_91

Because 
formula_92 
as a geometric series. This indicates that for this case, 1 is the integral of formula_64.

Since cases 1 and 2 are exhaustive, this shows that the integral of formula_64 is 1 and all properties from the above section hold.

==McShane integral==
Lebesgue integral on a line can also be presented in a similar fashion.

If we take the definition of the Henstock–Kurzweil integral from above, and we drop the condition

formula_8

then we get a definition of the McShane integral, which is equivalent to the Lebesgue integral. Note that the condition

formula_96

does still apply, and we technically also require formula_97 for formula_98 to be defined.

<doc id="412710" wikidata="Q955950" url="?curid=412710" title="Raytheon T-1 Jayhawk">
<text>The Raytheon T-1 Jayhawk is a twin-engined jet aircraft used by the United States Air Force for advanced pilot training. T-1A students go on to fly airlift and tanker aircraft. The T-400 is a similar version for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force.

==Design and development==

The T-1A Jayhawk is a medium-range, twin-engine jet trainer used in the advanced phase of Air Force Joint Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training for students selected to fly strategic/tactical airlift or tanker aircraft. It is used also for training Air Force Combat Systems Officers in high and low level flight procedures during the advanced phase of training. It also augmented or served in lieu of the T-39 Sabreliner in the Intermediate phase of US Navy/Marine Corps Student Naval Flight Officer training until the joint Air Force-Navy/Marine Corps training pipeline split in 2010 and now remains solely in operation with the U.S. Air Force, leaving the Navy with the Sabreliner pending its eventual replacement. The T-1 Jayhawk shares the same letter and number as the long retired T-1 SeaStar under the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system.

The swept-wing T-1A is a military version of the Beechjet/Hawker 400A. It has cockpit seating for an instructor and two students and is powered by twin turbofan engines capable of an operating speed of Mach .78. The T-1A differs from its commercial counterpart with structural enhancements that provide for a large number of landings per flight hour, increased bird strike resistance and an additional fuselage fuel tank. A total of 180 T-1 trainers were delivered between 1992 and 1997.

The first T-1A was delivered to Reese Air Force Base, Texas, in January 1992, and student training began in 1993.

Another military variant is the Japan Air Self-Defense Force T-400 (400T) trainer, which shares the same type certificate as the T-1A.

==Variants==
;T-1A
:United States military designation for trainer powered by two JT15D-5B turbofans, 180 built.
;T-400
:Japanese military designation for the Model 400T powered by two JT15D-5F turbofans, also known by the project name TX; 13 built.

<doc id="412711" wikidata="Q213470" url="?curid=412711" title="Karelians">
<text>Karelians (; ; ; ) are a Baltic Finnic ethnic group who are indigenous to the historical region of Karelia, which is today split between Finland and Russia. Karelians living in Russian Karelia are considered a distinct ethnic group closely related to Finnish Karelians, who are considered a subset of Finns. This distinction historically arose from Karelia having been fought over and eventually split between Sweden and Novgorod, resulting in Karelians being under different cultural spheres.

In Russia, Karelians mostly live in the Republic of Karelia, where they are the designated ethnic group, and in other adjacent north-western parts of the country. They traditionally speak the Karelian language and are Eastern Orthodox Christians. There are also significant Karelian enclaves in the Tver and Novgorod oblasts, as some Karelians migrated to those areas after the Russo-Swedish War of 1656–1658.

In Finland, the term Karelian generally refers to the Finnish Karelians, who are a subset of Finns. There were Karelian-speaking Karelians living in the easternmost parts of Finnish Karelia, known as &quot;Border Karelia&quot; (&quot;Raja-Karjala&quot;). As Finland had to cede parts of Karelia to the Soviet Union in World War II, evacuated Karelians and Finnish Karelians settled elsewhere in Finland. A minority of them, about 38,000, were Border Karelian Orthodox Christians, who traditionally spoke Karelian. However, owing to Karelian not being recognized as its own language by the Finnish government until recently, most of these Karelians had no choice but to learn Finnish and now speak mostly Finnish.

==History==
===Middle Ages===

During the Early Middle Ages, settlers from western Finland mixed with the local population to form the Karelian ethnic group. Possible migration from elsewhere may also have contributed to the Karelian ethnic composition.

Archeological evidence indicates that Karelian inhabitation was highest along the western shore of Lake Ladoga and the Karelian Isthmus, with multiple cemeteries and other archeological discoveries dating from AD 600 to AD 800. In South Karelia, the number of archeological discoveries from this time period is lower, though permanent inhabitation was nonetheless present. Lappee, South Karelia has been continuously inhabited for approximately 2,000 years. In North Karelia, only one archeological discovery from this time period has been found, dating to the eighth century. The considerably higher number of archeological discoveries in these regions from AD 800 to AD 1050 indicates that the Karelian population grew and expanded rapidly during this time.

The first written mention of Karelia and Karelians occurs in Scandinavian sources. Several old Scandinavian sagas and chronicles refer to Karelia sometimes as Karjalabotn, Kirjalabotnar, or Kirjaland, which means that Karelians and Karelia were known to the Vikings as early as the 7th century. Another mention of Karelians in Scandinavian sources is &quot;The Chronicle of Erik&quot;. Part of the Chronicle attributes to the Karelians the sack and pillage of Sigtuna in 1187. This mention of Karelian raids on Sweden in the chronicle is given as the main reason to found Stockholm, the current capital of Sweden.

The first mention of Karelians in Russian chronicles dates to 1143, when the Novgorod chronicle mentions that Karelians raided neighbouring Tavastia (Häme). Russian chronicles referred to Karelians as &quot;Koryela&quot;. Until the end of the 13th century, Karelians enjoyed a period of relative independence and self-government. However, as Karelians came in contact with Novgorod some of them started to take part in internal and external Novgorodian politics. Russian chronicles mention a joint raid of Novgorod and Karelians on Tavastia in 1191. In the 13th century, the Karelian relationship with Novgorod underwent significant changes, from partnership and alliance to gradual dominance by the latter.

In 1227, an attempt was made to convert Karelians to Eastern Orthodoxy. In 1253, Karelians aided Novgorod in its wars with Estonians. In 1269, the prince of Novgorod prepared a raid against Karelians, but he abandoned his plans as he was advised against it by his councilors. In 1278, Novgorod made war against Karelians and, according to the chronicle, put Karelian lands &quot;to sword and fire&quot;, which significantly reduced Karelian military power.

While Novgorod unsuccessfully tried to subdue Karelians, Sweden achieved its goals over the neighbouring Finnish tribes. The Swedes raided Karelian lands, began to convert the local population to Roman Catholicism and attempted to ensure their complete dominance with the foundation of castles, in 1293 at Vyborg and in 1295 at Kexholm (Käkisalmi in Finnish, Koryela in Russian chronicles), on the sites of ancient Karelian settlements. However, Novgorod managed to repel the Swedish attack by capturing and burning down Kexholm Castle. After this, Sweden and Novgorod engaged in the long conflict for rule over the Karelians and their lands.

In 1314, Karelians rose up against efforts made to convert them to Christianity, according to the Novgorod chronicle. The first rebellion started against Russian Orthodoxy with Käkisalmi captured and the killing of all Christians there. Then the rebellion spread over all Karelian lands, which sufficiently weakened Novgorodian influence.

In 1323, Karelians suffered a forceful sundering as Sweden and Novgorod divided Karelian lands and their inhabitants by signing a peace agreement. The agreement transferred governance of all western Karelian lands to Swedish sovereignty, while eastern Karelian lands fell under Novgorodian rule. This sundering started a long process of separation of Karelians into two different halves, with the main difference being religion, as western Karelians became first Roman Catholic and later Lutheran, while eastern Karelians were converted to Eastern Orthodoxy.

Subsequent wars had Karelians fighting on both sides of the conflict and often against each other. Meanwhile, Karelians on the Novgorodian and later Russian side of the border continued to settle northward towards the White Sea. By the late 14th century, Russian Karelians established control over White Karelia and came in conflict with the Norwegians on the peninsula of Kola.

As the struggle for power in the region continued over the next centuries the borderline between Sweden and Russia moved several times with most of the changes happening in Northern Karelia and Kainuu. However, in 1617, the history of Karelians underwent a significant change as Russia ceded to Sweden, along with other territories, the eastern part of the Karelian Isthmus, Ladoga Karelia and modern-day North Karelia. This meant that the majority of Karelians were again living in one country, yet it did not bring peace to the Karelian people. As Sweden commenced the process of conversion of population of the ceded territories to Lutheran Protestantism, resistance appeared among Old-Believer Orthodox Karelians and neighbouring Orthodox Izhorians.

By the mid-17th century, the tension between the Lutheran Swedish government and Orthodox Karelians led to yet another conflict between Sweden and Russia. From 1656 to 1658, Russian armed forces waged war on Karelian territories and tried to recapture them with the aid of some of the sympathizing local Orthodox population, but after two years of fighting both sides came to a stand-still.

Many of the Karelians who remained Orthodox by 1658 were unwilling to remain in Sweden and convert to Lutheranism, which triggered a mass migration of many Orthodox Karelians from these areas into other parts of Russia, some going to the region of Tver and forming the Tver Karelians minority, while others moved to the region of Valdai in the Novgorod region and yet others to White Karelia by the White Sea.

As some of the lands in the eastern Karelian Isthmus and Ladoga Karelia became partially depopulated Sweden decided to move settlers from Savonia to those Karelian lands which resulted in a mixture of local Karelians with Savonians in some areas. However, as Savonians themselves are of Karelian origin, this migration mostly affected local Karelians religiously (as the majority of the population became Lutheran) and to some extent linguistically, but it did not bring major changes to the ethnic map of Karelia.

The next change happened in 1721 as Russia won the great northern war against Sweden (1700–21), which forced Sweden to cede the entire Karelian Isthmus and Ladoga Karelia to Russia, with its now mostly Lutheran population. Although there were attempts to convert the local population to Orthodoxy these did not meet with any success.

===Late modern period===

After Russia conquered the entire Finnish territories in yet another Russo-Swedish war in 1808–09, it was decided to join the Karelian Isthmus and Ladoga Karelia to the newly formed Grand Duchy of Finland in 1812, which brought all western Karelians into the same state with Finns, while eastern Karelians remained under independent Russian administration. Although Karelians ended up in the same country the religious difference between eastern and western Karelians remained a dividing factor, which somewhat affected the linguistics but even until the beginning of the 20th century both groups could understand each other. Yet eastern Karelians managed to preserve traditions and folklore better than western Karelians.

As the Grand Duchy of Finland was formed, its inhabitants struggled to properly identify themselves ethnically, some being Finnish, some Swedish and some Karelian. As the Fennoman movement started and the new Finnish nation commenced its forming and shaping process, attempts were made to restore the lost Finnish identity. The process of &quot;finnisation&quot; of Finland started. As part of that process during the 19th century, Finnish folklorists including Elias Lönnrot traveled to different parts of Eastern Karelia to gather folklore and epic poetry. The Orthodox Karelians in North Karelia and Russia were now seen as close brethren or even a sub-group of the Finns. The ideology of &quot;Karelianism&quot; inspired Finnish artists and researchers, who believed that the Orthodox Karelians had retained elements of an archaic, original Finnish culture which had disappeared from Finland. This led to numerous confusions with some claiming that western and eastern Karelians were different nations.

As Finland gained its independence in 1917 the process of &quot;finnisation&quot; continued, but now even eastern Karelians were viewed as part of the Finnish nation. From 1918 to 1922, Finland made several attempts to expand into Eastern Karelia with some support by local Karelians. Several thousands of eastern Karelians migrated to Finland by 1922 from different parts of Eastern Karelia.

After the Winter War, Finland had to cede the Karelian Isthmus and Ladoga Karelia to the USSR. As the local Karelian population was unwilling to end up under Soviet rule, over 400,000 people were evacuated across Finland&#x27;s new border from the territories that were to be ceded. After the Continuation War (1941–1944), in which Finland temporarily held most of Eastern Karelia, several thousands of Karelians chose to migrate west as Finnish forces retreated. The Karelians who migrated to Finland in the 20th century were initially Karelian speakers, but due to minor lingual differences and in order to assimilate into the local communities soon adopted the Finnish language after the war. Some of the evacuees later immigrated, mainly to Sweden, Australia and North America.

Russian Karelians, living in the Republic of Karelia, are nowadays rapidly being absorbed into the Russian population. This process began several decades ago. For example, it has been estimated that even between the 1959 and 1970 Soviet censuses, nearly 30 percent of those who were enumerated as Karelian by self-identification in 1959 changed their self-identification to Russian 11 years later.

==Language==
The Karelian language is closely related to the Finnish language. There are the dialects of what can be classified of Karelian language
* North Karelian (northern parts of the Karelian republic and in some villages near the Russian border in the Kainuu region even today)
* South Karelian (Southern parts of the Karelian republic, before World War II also in the easternmost part of what was Finland before the war, and in different locations in the current area of Finland and elsewhere after WWII)
** Tver Karelian (In Tver area, Russia)
* Olonets Karelian or Livvi (in southeastern parts of Karelian republic, before World War II also in the easternmost part of What was Finland before the war, and in different locations in the current area of Finland and elsewhere after the WWII)

Ludic in the easternmost part of Karelian republic is currently considered as language of its own.

In addition to that, dialects of Karelian language are also spoken in different locations in the current area of Finland and elsewhere after WWII and in some villages near the Russian border in Kainuu region the northern dialect of Karelian language has been spoken continuously until now.

==Religion==
The majority of Russian Karelians are Eastern Orthodox Christians. Karelian shamanism is still practiced by some Karelians. Folk-beliefs have also been widely incorporated into Christianity by Orthodox Karelians. Karelian tales, along with some Finnish ones, have been collected to form Kalevala.

==Demographics==

Significant enclaves of Karelians exist in the Tver oblast of Russia, resettled after Russia&#x27;s defeat in 1617 against Sweden — in order to escape forced conversion to Lutheranism in Swedish Karelia. The Russians also promised tax deductions if the Orthodox Karelians migrated there. Olonets (Aunus) is the only city in Russia where the Karelians form a majority (60% of the population).

Karelians have been declining in numbers in modern times significantly due to a number of factors. These include low birthrates (characteristic of the region in general) and especially Russification, due to the predominance of Russian language and culture.

In 1926, according to the census, Karelians only accounted for 37.4% of the population in the Soviet Karelian Republic (which at that time did not yet include territories that would later be taken from Finland and added, most of which had mostly Karelian inhabitants), or 100,781 Karelians. Russians, meanwhile, numbered 153,967 in Karelia, or 57.2% of the population. Adding the Tver Karelian population of 140,567 at the time to the statistic gives a total of at least 241,348 Karelians in the whole USSR, if not far more.

By 2000, there were 65,651 Karelians in the Republic of Karelia (65.1% of the number in 1926, including the Karelian regions taken from Finland which were not counted in 1926), and Karelians made up only 9.2% of the population in their homeland. Russians, meanwhile, were 76.6% of the population in Karelia.

In the 2021 Census, there were 25,901 Karelians in the Republic of Karelia, only 5.5% of the population. Meanwhile Russians now make up 86.4% of the population in Karelia. The total number of Karelians in Russia was 32,422, or 0.02% of the country&#x27;s population.

== Genetics ==

The Y-chromosome haplogroup N1c is typical among Karelians, as it is observed in either slightly more or less than 40 percent of Karelian men. It has high frequencies among Uralic-speaking and other North Eurasian populations. Haplogroup R1a is approximately as common for Karelian males, and 10 percent of them belong to the haplogroup I-M170. The mtDNA haplogroups among Karelians include H (45.7%) and U (27.2%), especially its subclade U5.

While their autosomal ancestry is mostly European, Karelians also carry some Siberian-related admixture (6–12 %) commonly found in Uralic-speaking groups. Like other Baltic Finnic peoples, Karelians have a high level of Steppe-related admixture. Karelians cluster with Finns and Vepsians.

Karelians share more IBD (identity-by-descent) segments with several other Uralic-speaking groups, including geographically distant ones from Volga-Ural and Siberia, than with their non-Uralic-speaking neighbours. This is consistent with the idea that the Uralic peoples share common roots to some degree. Karelians are found to have significant IBD sharing with some non-Uralic-speaking peoples from the same distant regions, such as the Volga Tatars, Yakuts and Evens, as well.

<text>Smith Square Hall (formerly St John&#x27;s Smith Square) is a concert hall in the centre of Smith Square, Westminster, London.

Originally a church, this Grade I listed building was designed by Thomas Archer and was completed in 1728 as one of the so-called Fifty New Churches. It is regarded as one of the finest works of English Baroque architecture, and features four corner towers and monumental broken pediments. It is often referred to as &#x27;Queen Anne&#x27;s Footstool&#x27; because as legend has it, when Archer was designing the church he asked the Queen what she wanted it to look like. She kicked over her footstool and said &#x27;Like that!&#x27;, giving rise to the building&#x27;s four corner towers.

Ruined following firebombing in the Second World War, it was sold to a charitable trust and restored as a concert hall.

==History==

In 1710, the long period of Whig domination of British politics ended as the Tories swept to power under the rallying cry of &quot;The Church in Danger&quot;. Under the Tories&#x27; plan to strengthen the position of the Anglican Church and in the face of widespread damage to church buildings after a storm in November 1710, Parliament concluded that 50 new churches would be necessary in the cities of London and Westminster. An Act of Parliament in 1711 levied a tax on coal imports into the Port of London to fund the scheme and appointed a commission to oversee the project. Archer was appointed to this commission alongside, amongst others, Hawksmoor, Vanburgh and Wren. The site for St John&#x27;s was acquired from Henry Smith (who was also Treasurer to the Commissioners) in June 1713 for £700 and building commenced immediately. However, work proceeded slowly and the church was finally completed and consecrated in 1728. In total, the building had cost £40,875. The church was built by Edward Strong the Younger a friend of Christopher Wren the Younger.

St John&#x27;s famous nickname &#x27;Queen Anne&#x27;s Footstool&#x27; was coined early in its history. According to legend, Archer consulted the ailing Queen Anne about his designs for the new church. The Queen, not noted for her interest in architecture, petulantly kicked over her footstool, pointed at its upturned shape and snapped &quot;Like that!&quot; The towers were, in fact, added to stabilise the building against subsidence.

In 1939, the church was the site of the wedding of Randolph Churchill, the son of Winston Churchill to Pamela Digby. The wedding attracted large crowds, and a great deal of media attention both in the UK and in the United States.

For 213 years, the Church of St John the Evangelist served the surrounding parish – although the life of the building appears somewhat accident-prone. In 1742 (the year before Archer&#x27;s death) its interior was damaged by fire and required extensive restoration; in 1773 it was struck by lightning and in 1815 the towers and roof had to be shored up. Finally on 10 May 1941, the church was directly hit by an incendiary bomb and gutted by fire during a bombing raid. A handwritten account of the events of that night hangs in a frame at the top of the stairs leading from the rear of the hall down to the Crypt (now the Footstool Restaurant). Subsequently, the church stood a ruin, open to the sky, for over 20 years.

Restoration of the building began in 1965 and it reopened as a concert hall in 1969 (see Restoration as a concert hall below).

In 2021 the charity running St John’s Smith Square merged with the orchestra Southbank Sinfonia. In 2024 the building was renamed Smith Square Hall.

==Rectors of St John&#x27;s, Smith Square==
Under the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act 1840, the rectory of St John&#x27;s was annexed to the canonry of Westminster Abbey held by John Jennings, such that Jennings and his successors as Canon would be Rector &quot;ipso facto&quot;.

The church was gutted by bombing in 1941. The canonry at Westminster was suspended on Russell Barry&#x27;s resignation to become Bishop of Southwell. The parish of St John&#x27;s was united with St Stephen&#x27;s, Rochester Row, on 24 November 1950.

==Architecture==

The architectural style of St John&#x27;s, Smith Square, has always provoked a reaction in the viewer, not always complimentary. An 18th-century commentator thought the new church &quot;singular, not to say whimsical&quot; and, later, Charles Dickens, in &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;, described it as appearing to be &quot;some petrified monster, frightful and gigantic, on its back with its legs in the air&quot;. However today St John&#x27;s is regarded as one of the masterpieces of English Baroque architecture.

The building was designed by Thomas Archer (1668–1743). We know that his family were country gentry, but nothing is known about his architectural training. After the usual education for a cultivated young gentleman – three years at Oxford followed by the Grand Tour of Europe – he made his way as a courtier being appointed to the post of Groom Porter by Queen Anne in 1705. As such, he was responsible for licensing all gambling at court (including tennis, dice and billiards). He retained this post for the rest of his life under her successors George I and George II and, in addition, acquired the sinecure of Comptroller of Customs of Newcastle in 1715. Not surprisingly, he became a wealthy man and on his death he left a legacy of £100,000 to his nephew in addition to property in London, Hampshire and Warwickshire. Possibly as a result of this wealth and the distractions of Court life, his architectural output was small – including some work at Chatsworth; Roehampton House (part of Queen Mary&#x27;s Hospital, until converted to flats in 2009–13); St Philip&#x27;s Church, Birmingham (now the cathedral), and St Paul&#x27;s Church, Deptford. However, the idiosyncratic personal style, which is the hallmark of St John&#x27;s, distinguishes all of his work. While his contemporaries included Vanbrugh and Hawksmoor, Archer&#x27;s style owes most to the Italian influences he experienced on his Grand Tour, primarily that of Borromini.

Writing in 1981, Sir Hugh Casson describes the building thus:
The plan is squarish and almost symmetrical, but like all Baroque churches the interlocking pattern of the internal spaces is ambiguous, so that you can &quot;see&quot; and comprehend the church centrally or longitudinally as you prefer. The outside is such a turmoil of movement that you could almost say there are no walls or windows ... only a composition of classical elements, columns and cornices, moulded pediments and heavily modelled towers ... Archer handles all this with an energy, courage and confidence which is irresistible. Admittedly, it looks a bit too large for the space it occupies – rather like some great piece of machinery that has been parked in this tiny domestic little square of brick-faced houses and white sash-windows. But this architectural outsize swagger is part of its fascination. It positively challenges you to take it on full-face (and on all four faces). Once up the grand steps and through the doors the contrast is complete. All within is quiet simplicity – a lofty, spacious emptiness filled with a pale, clear light (there is no stained glass) – white walls contrasting with a scarlet curtain and a dark, polished timber gallery, giant white-painted Corinthian columns carrying a simple barrel-vaulted roof... It&#x27;s all as cool and quiet and evocative as the inside of a seashell. But there&#x27;s another surprise to come. Beneath the church and reached by stone spiral stairs in the corner tower is another architectural mood ... the crypt. Low brick vaults – hardly more than head-high – a sense of weight and gravity ... (no wonder, under the weight of so much masonry, the church began to sink into its marshy site while it was still building).

==Restoration as a concert hall==
 

The building was saved by the determination of Lady Parker of Waddington, commemorated by a plaque on the South wall of the hall. She formed the Friends of St John&#x27;s in 1962 to raise money and restore the church to its former splendour and to Thomas Archer&#x27;s original design for use as a concert hall. Work began in 1965 and the inaugural recital was given on 6 October 1969 by Dame Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge. The ex-cellist Eleanor Warren organised a series of BBC broadcasts from the restored church. She identified that it was an ideal venue for radio concerts. One of its advantages was its distance from traffic noise including underground trains. Each Monday lunchtime the music concerts would be broadcast on BBC Radio.

Since its rebirth as a concert venue, St John&#x27;s, Smith Square has come to be regarded as one of London&#x27;s major concert halls. Its acoustic is suitable for nearly all forms of music and the versatility of its space enables it to accommodate a range of music. The hall&#x27;s concert season begins in mid-September and continues to the following July/August, hosting concerts by internationally renowned singers and chamber musicians; solo instrumentalists; professional chamber orchestras and choirs, amateur choirs and orchestras (both adults and schools) as well as popular music artists.

St John&#x27;s receives no state or local authority subsidy. It relies entirely on income from concerts and recordings, and also on the generosity of charitable trusts, companies and individuals to survive and to develop its facilities. In 1986 an Appeal was launched to raise funds to commission and install a new concert organ using the antique organ case (built by Jordan, Byfield and Bridges in 1734) donated by Sir Duncan Oppenheim. After many donations and two Gala Concerts, the project reached a successful conclusion in 1993. The organ, built by Johannes Klais of Bonn, was named &quot;The Sainsbury Organ&quot; in recognition of the generosity of the Sainsbury family who made a highly significant contribution to the appeal.

In March 1999, after 10 months of being shrouded in scaffolding, the major project to clean the exterior of St John&#x27;s and repair stonework was completed. The National Heritage Lottery Fund made a substantial contribution to the costs of this essential maintenance work with partnership funding being donated by various trusts and companies. The 30th anniversary of St John&#x27;s was celebrated on 6 October 1999 with a Gala Concert, profits from which also contributed to the building restoration fund.

St John&#x27;s appears briefly as a concert hall in the film &quot;An Education&quot;, released in 2009. This is anachronistic, however, since the film is set in the early 1960s before St John&#x27;s was restored.

==Access==
Until September 2010, St John&#x27;s had no access or facilities for disabled people and was not easily accessible to the elderly. The sole access to the church from the exterior was by 14 steps – too steep for ramps. Interior access was again by steps either to the restaurant or the hall. A scheme was put in place to remedy this, the main elements of which involved the installation of a lift to serve the ground, crypt (box office and restaurant) and concert levels. The box office and main entrance foyer were relocated to the area near to the lift, providing a new and more attractive and prominent shared point of entry for all. Adapted lavatories were also provided in the crypt. The artists’ dressing rooms also relocated allowing more direct access to the stage. A platform lift is also available, allowing disabled performers to gain access to the stage level.

==Crypt==
Access to the crypt is by way of stairs from the main portico steps or via the spiral staircase towards the rear of the hall. This part of the building was not damaged by the wartime bombing, so the brickwork is the original 18th century. Unlike other notable churches of the period (for example Christ Church, Spitalfields, whose crypt was excavated by archaeologists in the 1980s yielding much information about the 18th-century inhabitants of the parish), that of St John&#x27;s was never used for burials. In fact, for most of the 18th and 19th centuries, the space was let for storage of wines and beer.

==Burial ground==
The church&#x27;s burial ground is situated in Horseferry Road, next to the former Westminster Hospital buildings. The site is now designated St John&#x27;s Gardens and the remaining grave-slabs, now much eroded, are arranged around the perimeter of the garden.
