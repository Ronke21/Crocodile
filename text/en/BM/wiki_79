<text>Ozma is an American rock band from Pasadena, California. The band&#x27;s sound is a mix of nostalgic new wave–influenced power pop and contrapuntal Casiotone-driven melodies sustained by heavy guitar riffs. Since their formation in 1995, Ozma has released five studio albums and toured the U.S., Japan and Canada more than thirty times, including extensive touring with stylistically similar groups including Weezer, Nada Surf, Rilo Kiley, Superdrag, The Rentals, The Get Up Kids, Piebald, Saves The Day, Asian Kung-Fu Generation, and Rooney.

==History==
===Early years (1995–2001)===
Ozma was formed in September 1995 by Ryen Slegr (vocals/guitar), Jose Galvez (guitar/vocals), Patrick Edwards (drums) and Daniel Brummel (vocals/bass), Galvez introduced Brummel to the others, whom he met on AOL while Brummel was looking for a band to join. In 1996, the still-unnamed band were joined by Katherine Kieckhefer on keyboards, before deciding on the name &quot;Ozma&quot; (taken from the L. Frank Baum books on the drummer&#x27;s mother&#x27;s bookshelf) in 1997, and in 1998 were joined by expert keyboardist Star Wick, who replaced the departing Kieckhefer. After their early 4-track cassette demos &quot;Cuatro&quot; and &quot;Ocho&quot; were well received by friends, they released &quot;Songs of Inaudible Trucks and Cars&quot; in early 1999, a collection of demos and live tracks, released on home-made CD-Rs and later republished on MP3.com as &quot;Songs of Audible Trucks and Cars&quot; (due to a character restriction). They then self-released what is considered their first &quot;proper&quot; studio album, &quot;Rock and Roll Part Three,&quot; on January 1, 2000. This consisted of &quot;a few thousand&quot; (estimated by Brummel) CDs manufactured by their own label, Tornado Recordings. During these early years, Ozma &quot;played almost anywhere in the California state area,&quot; garnering a strong regional following.

Ozma&#x27;s first real break came in 2001, when they were selected to tour with Weezer. In preparation for the &quot;Yahoo! Outloud Tour,&quot; Weezer asked their fans to vote for an opening act via their web site, and the bands who received the most votes were Ozma and The Get Up Kids. One year later, Weezer invited Ozma to tour with them again on 2002&#x27;s &quot;Hyper Extended Midget Tour&quot;, which also featured Saves the Day.

The band self-released their second album &quot;The Doubble Donkey Disc&quot; on February 21, 2002 (later reissued on Kung Fu Records on June 25, 2002). With this release, Ozma experimented with the traditional Russian balalaika and the flute to create a sound they called &quot;Russian coldfusion.&quot; The disc was split into two imaginary concept EPs: the first five songs (including the Russian folk song &quot;Korobeiniki&quot;, more famously the &quot;Tetris&quot; theme) revolved around Russian themes, while the second half created a more danceable atmosphere.

===Kung Fu years (2001–2004)===
Later in 2001, partly as a result of the exposure gained from touring with Weezer, Ozma signed with Kung Fu Records, which led to a mainstage appearance on the 2002 Warped Tour. Over the next two years, Kung Fu put out remastered and enhanced versions of &quot;Rock and Roll Part Three&quot; and &quot;The Doubble Donkey Disc&quot;, before Ozma&#x27;s third album, &quot;Spending Time On The Borderline&quot;, was released in May 6, 2003. This record saw Ozma mature their sound and expand their musical outlook, moving away—at times significantly—from the keyboard-driven, often video game–themed rock of the earlier albums. During the 2001–2004 period, Ozma toured the US numerous times, with bands such as Nada Surf, Superdrag, Piebald, The Format, and Rilo Kiley. 

On July 23, 2004, Ozma announced that they had disbanded, citing deteriorating relationships between band members. Daniel Brummel moved to New York City to pursue a more folk-heavy style and released his debut solo album &quot;Speak Easy&quot; independently on September 27, 2005. Also during this interim period, Ryen Slegr and Jose Galvez formed &quot;Yes Dear&quot; with ex-members of Arlo and Teen Heroes. On January 9, 2006, Ozma announced that the band had reunited—without Edwards—to play new shows, new songs, and put out new records. During July and August 2006 the band joined The Rentals for the &quot;Return Tour,&quot; with Slegr (now an official member of The Rentals) performing in both bands. During the tour, Ozma rotated many new songs through their setlist. In September, the band announced that they would be touring the nation again in October with the band Hellogoodbye.

===&quot;Pasadena&quot; (2006–2013)===

On May 15, 2007, the band released their fourth studio album, &quot;Pasadena&quot; (after their hometown of Pasadena, CA), through About a Girl Records. The album included guest appearances by Matthew Caws (Nada Surf), Will Noon (Straylight Run, Fun), Rachel Haden (The Rentals, that dog.), Ben Pringle (The Rentals, Nerf Herder), and Eric Summer (Get Set Go). Allmusic referred to &quot;Pasadena&quot; as &quot;the strongest work of their careers,&quot; rating it 4.5 out of 5 stars.

===&quot;Boomtown&quot; (2012–present)===

In 2012, Ozma performed on the inaugural Weezer Cruise, alongside Dinosaur Jr. and Sebadoh. Then, in late 2013, Ozma held PledgeMusic campaign to fund their unnamed fifth album. Their goal was exceeded, and &quot;Boomtown&quot; was released digitally on February 11, 2014. Immediately following the digital release, Ozma joined Weezer, Cat Power, The Orwells, DIIV, and Adam Devine on the second Weezer Cruise, being the only band aside from Weezer to perform on both cruises.

==Popular culture==
Ozma&#x27;s cover of the Russian folk song &quot;Korobeiniki&quot; was featured in &quot;Kick-Ass 2&quot;.

A person in the crowd in the film &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; can be seen wearing an Ozma t-shirt.

The song &quot;Rocks&quot; was heard in the Nickelodeon teen sitcom &quot;iCarly&quot;, in the 2008 episode &quot;iMight Switch Schools&quot;&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="422915" wikidata="Q7869290" url="?curid=422915" title="USS F-4">
<text>USS &quot;F-4&quot; (SS-23) was a United States Navy F-class submarine. Her keel was laid down by the Moran Company of Seattle, Washington, sponsored by Mrs. Manson Franklin. Backus, wife of a successful Seattle business man and banker. The submarine was originally named &quot;Skate&quot;, making her the first ship of the United States Navy named for the skate. She was renamed &quot;F-4&quot; on 17 November 1911, launched on 6 January 1912 and commissioned on 3 May 1913.

==Service history==
Joining the First Submarine Group, Pacific Torpedo Flotilla, &quot;F-4&quot; participated in the development operations of that group along the west coast, and from August 1914, in Hawaiian waters out of Naval Submarine Base Pearl Harbor. During submarine maneuvers off Honolulu, Hawaii on 25 March 1915, she sank at a depth of , from the harbor. The ship&#x27;s electrician&#x27;s mate 3rd class, James Morton Hoggett, was not on shore leave as was commonly reported. He was standing his duty as watchman, the crew member left ashore to receive any important news that occurred ashore while the ship was at sea and relay it to the captain on the ship&#x27;s return. This was commonly done before ships had radios. He was the only survivor. Despite the valiant efforts of the Honolulu naval authorities to locate the missing boat and save her crew, all 21 aboard perished. &quot;F-4&quot; was the first commissioned submarine of the U.S. Navy to be lost at sea.

== Salvage and recovery ==
A diving and engineering precedent was established with the Navy&#x27;s raising of the submarine on 29 August 1915. Divers descended to attach cables to tow the boat into shallow water, Naval Constructor Julius A. Furer, Rear Admiral C.B.T. Moore, and Lieutenant C. Smith were able to do this with the use of specially devised and constructed pontoons. Navy diver George D Stillson found the superstructure caved in and the hull filled with water. One of the divers involved in the salvage operation was John Henry Turpin, who was, probably, the first African-American to qualify as a U.S. Navy Master Diver. Only four of the dead could be identified; the 17 others were buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

The investigating board subsequently conjectured that corrosion of the lead lining of the battery tank had permitted seepage of sea water into the battery compartment and thereby caused the commanding officer to lose control on a submerged run. Others believe that the bypassing of an unreliable magnetic reducer closed a Kingston valve in the forward ballast tank resulting in a delay. Based on other reported issues, there may also have been problems with the air lines supplying the ballast tank.

&quot;F-4&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 August 1915 and was taken from the dry dock in Honolulu Harbor in early September 1915 so the other three F-Class submarines could be dry docked as they had been rammed by the navy supply ship . The &quot;F-4&quot; was moved, still hanging from the pontoons to Pearl Harbor and anchored in Magazine Loch until on or about 25 November 1915, when she was disconnected from the pontoons and settled into the mud at the bottom of the loch. She remained there until the expansion of the harbor in 1940, when the remains of &quot;F-4&quot; were re-buried in a trench dug in the loch bottom off the Submarine Base Mooring S14, Pearl Harbor.

<text>The Socialist Reich Party () was a West German political party founded in the aftermath of World War II in 1949 as an openly neo-Nazi-oriented splinter from the national conservative German Right Party (DKP-DRP). The SRP achieved some electoral success in northwestern Germany (Lower Saxony and Bremen), before becoming the first political party to be banned by the Federal Constitutional Court in 1952. They were allied with the French organization led by René Binet known as the New European Order.

==History==
The Socialist Reich Party (SRP) was formed on 2 October 1949 in Hameln by Otto Ernst Remer, Fritz Dorls, and Gerhard Krüger after they had been excluded from the DKP-DRP. The SRP saw itself as a legitimate heir of the Nazi Party; most party adherents were former NSDAP members. Its foundation was backed by former &quot;Luftwaffe Oberst&quot; Hans-Ulrich Rudel.

Krüger was a member of the SA and holder of a Golden Party Badge while Remer helped suppress the 20 July plot.

The SRP had organisations similar to those operated by the Nazis such as the paramilitary led by Remer, youth wing (Hitler Youth), and (National Socialist Women&#x27;s League).

&quot;FR-Briefe&quot; was a private party newsletter that operated in the SRP&#x27;s early days. &quot;Deutsche Reichszeitung&quot;, later renamed &quot;Deutsche Wacht&quot;, was acquired for the party&#x27;s weekly newspaper in March 1950.

Dorls had been elected to the Bundestag in the 1949 election as a member of the German Right Party (DRP). Fritz Rössler, another DRP deputy, joined the party. The SRP performed poorly in the 1950 elections held in Schleswig-Holstein, but received over 10% of the vote in two of the three districts it ran for in North Rhine-Westphalia. In the 1951 elections the SRP received over 400,000 votes, worth around 11% of the vote, Lower Saxony and 7.7% in Bremen. These results gave them 8 seats in the Bürgerschaft of Bremen and 16 seats in the Landtag of Lower Saxony. 12 of their deputies in Lower Saxony were former members of the Nazi Party.

The West German government requested the SRP be banned on 16 November 1951, and the Federal Constitutional Court ruled in favor of banning the party on 23 October 1952. Before the ban, Remer had compared the situation of the SRP with that of the early Christians, referred to High Commissioner John J. McCloy as &quot;the Pontius Pilate who had caused Herod [to] crucify the SRP&quot;, and declared that &quot;if we should be banned, we shall descend into the catacombs&quot;.

The party claimed Chancellor Konrad Adenauer was an American puppet and that Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz was the last legitimate President of the German Reich, as he had been appointed by Adolf Hitler. It denied the existence of the Holocaust, claimed that the United States built the gas ovens of the Dachau concentration camp after the Second World War and that films of concentration camps were faked. The SRP also advocated Europe, led by a reunited German Reich, as a &quot;third force&quot; against both capitalism and communism. It demanded the re-annexation of the former eastern territories of Germany and a &quot;solution of the Jewish question&quot;. According to Karl Dietrich Bracher, &quot;SRP propaganda concentrated on a vague &#x27;popular socialism&#x27; in which the old Nazis rediscovered well-worn slogans, and also on a nationalism whose championship of Reich and war was but a thinly disguised continuation of the ideology&quot;. The SRP also promoted the stab-in-the-back myth, structured itself in a very hierarchical manner reminiscent of the , organized meetings that featured uniformed guards, and &quot;succeeded temporarily in presenting Remer as the protector of the Third Reich against the &#x27;traitors&#x27; of the resistance&quot;.

According to Martin A. Lee, although the SRP was anti-communist, it focused on criticizing Britain and the United States for &quot;splitting their beloved Fatherland in two&quot; and avoided criticism of the Soviet Union in the hope that a future deal could be made with the Soviets to reunite Germany. The SRP took the stance that Germany should remain neutral in the emerging Cold War and opposed the West German government&#x27;s Atlanticist foreign policy. In case of war between the Soviet Union and the West, Remer &quot;insisted that Germans should not fight to cover an American retreat if the Russians got the upper hand in a war&quot;, and said that he would &quot;show the Russians the way to the Rhine&quot; and that SRP members would &quot;post themselves as traffic policemen, spreading their arms so that the Russians can find their way through Germany as quickly as possible&quot;. Martin A. Lee alleges that these statements attracted the attention of Soviet officials, who became willing to fund the SRP for tactical reasons. According to Lee, for a few years in the early 1950s the SRP received Soviet funds while the Communist Party of Germany did not, due to being purportedly viewed as &quot;ineffectual&quot;. The SRP viewed Israel as an &quot;enemy power&quot; in its foreign policy.

One of the most significant pieces of evidence is the testimony of Otto Ernst Remer. In a 1997 interview, Remer admitted that he had received Soviet backing during his time in the party. Remer stated that he had met with KGB officials in East Berlin and had received financial and logistical support from the Soviet Union. In addition to Remer&#x27;s testimony, there are other sources of evidence that support the claim that the Soviet Union supported the SRP. For example, a 1953 KGB memo outlines the agency&#x27;s efforts to cultivate and support right-wing extremist groups in Germany, including the SRP. The memo states that the KGB&#x27;s aim was &quot;to create a rightist movement that will weaken the position of the United States, weaken the position of the Atlantic bloc, and encourage the German population to seek a neutralist policy&quot;. Similarly, the CIA&#x27;s declassified &quot;Family Jewels&quot; documents reveal that the agency had evidence of Soviet funding for far-right groups in Europe, including the SRP. Other examples of this include a comment supposedly made by Wolf von Westarp that the West Comminission of East Germany´s ruling Socialist Unity Party, was a substantial patron of the party. Historian Michael Burleigh, in his book &quot;The Third Reich: A New History&quot;, discusses the Soviet Union&#x27;s support for the SRP during the Cold War in extreme detail. Additionally, the Gauck archives in Germany contain evidence of Soviet support for the SRP. The archives contain documents that show that the Stasi, the East German secret police, had frequent meetings with SRP officials and provided them with financial and logistical support.

<doc id="422922" wikidata="Q4355033" url="?curid=422922" title="Dora Russell">
<text>Dora Winifred Russell, Countess Russell ( Black; 3 April 1894 – 31 May 1986) was a British author, a feminist and socialist campaigner, and the second wife of the philosopher Bertrand Russell. She was a campaigner for contraception and peace. She worked for the UK-government-funded Moscow newspaper &quot;British Ally&quot;, and in 1958 she led the &quot;Women&#x27;s Peace Caravan&quot; across Europe during the Cold War.

== Early life ==
Dora Winifred Black was born at 1 Mount Villas, Luna Road, Thornton Heath, Croydon, in Surrey, into an English upper-middle-class family, the second of four children. Her father, Sir Frederick Black, worked his way up in the Civil Service and laid great store by his children&#x27;s education, regardless of their gender. She went to a private co-educational primary school near her parents&#x27; home and won a junior scholarship to Sutton High School. In 1911, she spent nearly a year at a private boarding school for girls in Germany, in preparation for the &#x27;Little Go&#x27; at Cambridge. There she won a modern languages scholarship to Girton College, Cambridge. Soon she joined the Heretics Society, co-founded by C.K. Ogden in 1909. It questioned traditional authorities in general and religious dogma in particular. The society helped her to discard traditional values and develop her own feminist mode of thought. In June 1915, she received a first class degree with distinction in Modern Languages at Girton.

==Career==
After the victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution in Russia, Russell decided to attend the Second World Congress of the Comintern with Marjory Newbold and others, in support of Bolshevik cause.

==Birth control campaigning==
Russell supported Rose Witcop and Guy Aldred and who were prosecuted for publishing Margaret Sanger&#x27;s &quot;Family Limitation&quot; which was a guide to contraception. Their action was denounced by a magistrate as &quot;indiscriminate&quot; publication and the contraception guides were to be destroyed. Russell, her husband and John Maynard Keynes, paid the legal costs of the unsuccessful appeal.

In 1924 Russell campaigned for birth control with the support of Katharine Glasier, Susan Lawrence, Margaret Bonfield, Dorothy Jewson, H. G. Wells and John Maynard Keynes and founded the Workers&#x27; Birth Control Group which provided advice on birth control to working-class women. In the same year she ran unsuccessfully as a Labour candidate for Chelsea. She campaigned in the Labour Party for birth control clinics, but the party was afraid of losing the support of Roman Catholic voters. She said that she hated the Labour Party after the leadership overruled her lobbied support at the 1925 convention. Public male ally H. G. Wells refused to support her campaign which he believed was only of appeal to women.



In 1929 Russell organised the World League for Sexual Reform&#x27;s highly successful Congress in London with the Australian-born birth control campaigner Norman Haire. Held over the course of five days in Wigmore Hall it was attended by leading intellectuals including George Bernard Shaw, Margaret Sanger and Sigmund Freud who debated topics that included psychoanalysis, prostitution, censorship, and contraception.

== Beacon Hill School and views on education ==

In 1927 Russell founded a progressive school called Beacon Hill School, with Bertrand Russell, in which they tried to teach children to leave behind superstition and the irrational views of previous generations. Instead, Russell espoused scientific, libertarian and progressive education, with one former student reminiscing: &quot;One of my fondest memories is of the Natural History lessons with Dora, based on the study of that great tome ‘The Science of Life’ (by H. G. Wells, Julian Huxley &amp; G. P.Wells). Dora encouraged us to question, to follow our curiosity […] into all sorts of highways &amp; bye-ways of phenomena of life; to speculate; to wonder […] I remember sheer fascination and a sense of the infinity of the field of knowledge that was waiting to be explored.&quot;Russell expressed her views on education in a book called &quot;In Defence of Children&quot;. Russell ran the school on her own until World War II.

== World War II ==
During the war she moved to London where she worked for the Ministry of Information in their Reference Division which was located in a London University building near the British Museum. There she wrote reports to order on various subjects. From there she joined the group employed by the British Government to create the newspaper &quot;British Ally: Britansky Soyuznik&quot; which for six years was published in Moscow via the British Embassy. The newspaper mirrored a Soviet newspaper published in London and both had started due to a 1942 treaty. The newspaper was intended to give details of the British war effort and it was well illustrated and well received in Russia.

== Peace activism ==
After the war, she became an advocate of the peace movement and was one of the founding members of the CND, in which she joined with other prominent leftists (Bertrand Russell, J. B. Priestley, Michael Foot, Victor Gollancz among others) in campaigning for worldwide nuclear disarmament.

&quot;It has taken us centuries of thought and mockery to shake the medieval system. – With this in view I have taken as impulses, instincts, or needs certain driving forces in the human species as we know it at present, and argued for such social and economic changes as will give them new, free, and varied expression. To take even this first step towards a happy society is a herculean task. After it has been accomplished, generations to come will see what the creature [us] will do next. We none of us know; and we should be thoroughly on our guard against all those who pretend that they do.&quot;She was still speaking on peace issues on 2 April 1981, when she addressed a Merseyside Peace Week.

=== Women&#x27;s Peace Caravan ===
The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament was formed in 1957. On 20 May 1958 Russell set out from Edinburgh with fifteen other women on what became known as the &quot;Women&#x27;s Peace Caravan&quot;. The motorised caravan set out for Moscow and to make links with other women across Europe.

== Relationship with Bertrand Russell ==
By the autumn of 1915 Dora Black had moved to London and begun postgraduate studies in eighteenth-century French thought at University College London. She first met Bertrand Russell in 1916 when joining him on a weekend walking tour. However, the pair did not embark on a relationship before 1919, when Russell invited her to join him during his summer holidays. Before that, Black had supported Russell in his campaign against military conscription in World War I.

Black and Russell visited Soviet Russia in 1920, soon after the Bolshevik revolution. Russell was unimpressed by Vladimir Lenin, but Black, like many English socialists at the time, saw a vision of a future ideal civilisation. The couple also visited China.

=== Marriage to Bertrand Russell===
Dora and Russell were married on 25 September 1921 at Battersea Town Hall with Eileen Power and Frank Russell acting as witnesses. Dora, who was seven months pregnant with the couple&#x27;s first child, John, wore black during the ceremony. Their second child Kate was born in 1923.

She had at first rejected Russell&#x27;s offer of marriage. In common with some radical women of her generation, she felt the laws regulating marriage contributed to women&#x27;s subjugation. In her view, only parents should be bound by a social contract, and only insofar as their co-operation was required for raising their children. Implicit was her conviction that both men and women were polygamous by nature and should therefore be free, whether married or not, to engage in sexual relationships that were based on mutual love. In this she was as much an early sexual pioneer as in her fight for women&#x27;s right to information about, and free access to, birth control. She regarded these as essential for women to gain control over their own lives, and eventually become fully emancipated. Her husband was a supporter of radical views but she said that she was expected to do the &quot;bottle-washing&quot;.

She published her book on the inadequate education of women and inequality with the title &quot;Hypatia or Woman and Knowledge&quot; in 1925. The prologue explains why she chose the title: &quot;Hypatia was a university lecturer denounced by Church dignitaries and torn to pieces by Christians. Such will probably be the fate of this book.&quot;

Russell became Countess Russell on 3 March 1931, when Bertrand Russell&#x27;s elder brother Frank died and her husband became the 3rd Earl Russell. Bertrand left her for their children&#x27;s governess, Patricia Spence. She noted that during the divorce her husband used all of his privilege to gain advantage.

Bertrand married Patricia Spence in January 1936. Dora had two children with journalist Griffin Barry while still married to Russell.

==Death==
She died at Porthcurno, Cornwall, on 31 May 1986, aged 92. Her ashes were scattered in the garden there.

<text>(JAA) was a subsidiary of Japan Airlines (JAL) founded due to the legal status of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and territory disputes with the People&#x27;s Republic of China in order to allow Japan Airlines to continue flying to Taiwan from Japan. JAA was headquartered in the Japan Airlines Building in Shinagawa, Tokyo.

JAA was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of JAL on 8 August 1975 and given the responsibility of providing air links between Japan and Taiwan, formerly offered by JAL.

Direct flights between Japan and Taiwan had been suspended since April 1975, following the signing of a civil air treaty with the People&#x27;s Republic of China. However, following negotiations between the Interchange Association, Japan and Taiwan&#x27;s Association of East Asian Relations, JAA was created and direct flights to Taipei were resumed. JAA began flights to Taipei on September 15, 1975.

Similar arrangements were later made by Air France, British Airways, KLM, Qantas and Swissair for their services to Taiwan.

In 1985, JAA was headquartered in the Yurakucho-Denki Building in Chiyoda, Tokyo, in a facility separate from the JAL headquarters in the Tokyo Building in Chiyoda.

Following JAL&#x27;s privatization, the new 2007 Japan-Taiwan air transport agreement led JAL to liquidate JAA as a cost-saving measure and to normalize Japan-Taiwan flight status. JAA flew its last flights on March 31, 2008, and all flights were operated by JAL from April 1, 2008.

== Destinations ==

Routes served by JAA before being folded into JAL:

*Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport — Narita International Airport
*Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport — Kansai International Airport
*Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport — Chubu Centrair International Airport
*Kaohsiung International Airport — Narita International Airport

The above routes were all taken over by JAL on 1 April 2008.

Historically, JAA even offered Taipei — Okinawa, Taipei — Hong Kong, and Taipei — Manila routes under the Fifth Freedom traffic rights granted by Taiwan, as well as the connection flights between Taipei and Kaohsiung before the direct Narita–Kaohsiung route was inaugurated in August 2005. JAA was to date the only international carrier to be granted the right to fly in-island by the Civil Aeronautics Administration (Republic of China).

== Fleet ==

The Japan Asia Airways fleet consisted of the following aircraft before its integration to Japan Airlines:

*Boeing 767-300
*Boeing 747-300
*Boeing 747-100
*Boeing 747-200
*McDonnell Douglas DC-8-62H
*McDonnell Douglas DC-10-40

Beginning in 2004, most JAA flights were operated with JAL Boeing 747-400 aircraft to meet market demand and to improve JAL fleet utilization. Previously, JAA operated Douglas DC-8-53/61, Boeing 747-100/200 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10-40 aircraft.

<text>Northwest University is a private Christian university in Kirkland, Washington, United States. The university offers associate, baccalaureate, master&#x27;s, and doctorate degrees through its College of Arts &amp; Sciences, School of Business and Management, School of Education, Mark and Huldah Buntain School of Nursing, College of Ministry, and College of Social and Behavioral Sciences. It has a satellite campus in Salem, Oregon.

==History==
===Early history===
Northwest was started as a Bible Institute by the Northwest Ministry Network of the Assemblies of God USA and is still operated under the control of the Alaska, Montana, Oregon, Northwest, Southern Idaho, and Wyoming districts of the Assemblies of God.

The idea for starting a Bible institute in the Northwest started in 1928 at an annual meeting of the Northwest District Council of the Assemblies of God. J.S. Secrist, a council member had presented the idea, but it wasn&#x27;t until the annual meeting in 1933 that his idea was adopted by council members from all of the states in the District.

Meanwhile, a church in Seattle called the Hollywood Temple had invited a young man from Fargo, North Dakota, to be the pastor of the ministry. Henry H. Ness accepted the invitation and moved his family to Seattle the same year. After only a few months, Ness had the impression from God that he should start a Bible school. He approached the Northwest District of the Assemblies of God about starting the institute and offered the Hollywood Temple as the campus. Later that year, Ness became the first president of Northwest Bible Institute and C.C. Beatty became the first dean and instructor. Charles E. Butterfield, and T.S. Sandall, both pastors from the Puget Sound area also taught a couple of times a week. Other staff and faculty included Ruth Morris, an English teacher, Delbert Cox, who taught music, and Christiansen, who volunteered as the dean of students.

In 1949, Ness resigned from his position. After five months of searching for a new president, Charles Butterfield was appointed to the position. Along with the change in leadership came a change in the name of the Northwest Bible Institute to Northwest Bible College. In order to acquire accreditation, Butterfield required the faculty to have degrees or work to obtain them. He also made changes in the structure of the academics and administration so that the new college ran more like an educational institution focused on preparing people for a wide variety of ministries and vocations. By 1952, the Accrediting Association of Bible Colleges gave full accreditation to Northwest Bible College, and the United States Department of Education recognized them as a school of higher learning.

In the early 1950s, the Hollywood Temple had its name changed to Calvary Temple. The college had been expanding as had the church. Even with the acquisition of other buildings for dorms and the building of a new sanctuary for the church, the space was very limited. They started a campus fund in 1952 with $112.41. In 1955, the city of Seattle proposed the new I-5 freeway that would cut through the middle of campus. Butterfield knew that they needed a new place to go. Through many travels and visitations, he came to an old military shipbuilding facility and housing project on the east side of Lake Washington. As he prayed, he felt that God was promising this location as the future campus of Northwest Bible College. He pursued the purchase of the land and structures but was rejected. However, in 1958, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare awarded Northwest Bible College twenty-two and one-thirds acres at no cost. The college purchased an additional for 30,000 dollars. That summer, construction began and finished with 4 buildings designed by Butterfield&#x27;s son, Robert. H.J. Secrist, son of J.S. Secrist, volunteered as the construction manager with all other laborers volunteering their time as well. Classes began on September 28, 1959, and within a few years the campus had expanded to women and men&#x27;s dormitories, a cafeteria, a student center, and a gymnasium.

In 1962, Northwest Bible College was renamed as Northwest College of the Assemblies of God. At the end of the 1966 school year, D.V. Hurst became the third president of Northwest College. Hurst significantly improved the existing networks established by the Assemblies of God in the Northwest. He began holding info sessions for each district, allowing juniors and seniors to ask questions and meet with their district leaders. He was also the first to produce a hard copy of the policies and procedures of the college in a manual he gave to the faculty.

1984 marked the 50 year anniversary of Northwest. To commemorate this event, the Lay Council presented the school with a Ebenezer Stone of Remembrance as a visible sign of thanks to God for the last 50 years. They presented it on May 27, 1984, the same day that 173 graduates received their degrees bringing the total number of graduates to 3,460. Don Argue, the president of North Central Bible College was the speaker for graduation.

Northwest College also extended a 20-year lease to the Seattle Seahawks team in 1984 on a plot of undeveloped land on the west side of campus. The Seahawks signed the lease and built 3 fields, a bubble to house the artificial turf field, and a office complex. The Seahawks remained at the facilities until 2008 when they moved to a larger facility in Renton, Washington.

After almost 25 years as the president of Northwest College, Hurst decided to retire in the summer of 1990. The board of directors unanimously elected pastor and Superintendent of Assemblies of God Oregon District Dennis A. Davis to be the fourth president of Northwest College. Above all else, Davis was committed to the highest spiritual aspect of the students, saying that &quot;The challenge of the college is to always strengthen the academic programs in response to the mission and purpose of the college and to fulfill that mission and never to detour from it.&quot; He invited the students, faculty, and staff to gather on Wednesday mornings for prayer, a tradition that still continues, and offered an open-door policy to the students and declared that Wednesday would be &quot;Student Day in the life of the President.&quot;

Northwest College was also invited to join the Christian College Coalition (now the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities) – a large group of Christian schools dedicated to liberal arts education in a Christian light. Joining this consortium of colleges and universities led to the possibilities for students to study for a semester either overseas or at other Christian colleges in the country.

In 1996, Northwest College began offering an adult degree completion program called Leadership Education for Adult Professionals (LEAP). The LEAP program at Northwest enables working adults to attend night classes to receive a degree. Most of the adults in the program qualify for grants and scholarships.

After 8 years as president of Northwest, Dennis A. Davis resigned from his post. Don Argue became the 5th president of Northwest, but he was no stranger to the institution. His father had taken the pastoral role at Hollywood Temple in the late 1940s when Northwest&#x27;s first president Ness had resigned. Argue grew up around Northwest College and knew many of the people who had attended as well as faculty and staff. He had observed Ness and Butterfield&#x27;s leadership on campus as well. He said about them, &quot;Both of these former NC presidents were held in high honor in our home. They were men of vision and spiritual leadership. As a boy I felt my life was positively influenced by these men.&quot; Argue had also served as president of North Central Bible College for 16 years. At his inauguration, he committed himself to Northwest College with these words.

===Recent history===
Northwest University announced the opening of the Mark and Huldah Buntain College of Nursing in 1999. Mark and Huldah made a sizeable donation to the school from the organization they founded called Mission of Mercy in Kolkata, India. The School of Nursing offers a Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing and requires the nursing students to spend a month abroad, allowing students to put their skills to good use across the world.

In 2001, President Argue received word from the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges (now the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities) that Northwest could offer its first master&#x27;s degree. Argue took the opportunity and by the fall of 2001, Northwest offered the Master of Arts in Counseling Psychology program. Not only did graduates receive their degree, but they were eligible to become Washington State Board Licensed Professional Counselors. Currently, Northwest University offers eight master&#x27;s degrees in a variety of fields.

In 2003 Joshua Davey, a Northwest student, took the State of Washington to the United States Supreme court for denying him a state-sponsored scholarship, in &quot;Locke v. Davey&quot;. The court majority found the state&#x27;s exclusion from funding theology degrees complied with the Establishment Clause without violating the Free Exercise Clause.

In 2004, the Board of Directors decided to change the name of the college from Northwest College to Northwest University. The decision came after significant enrollment growth as well as growth in the academic programs and degrees offered. Soon after, in 2006, Northwest broke ground for the new Health and Sciences Center (HSC) above the Hurst Library. The second floor of the HSC serves as the location for the Mark and Huldah Buntain School of Nursing.

On October 27, 2007, Joseph Castleberry became the sixth president of Northwest University. Castleberry had previously served as the academic dean at the Assemblies of God Theological Seminary in Springfield, Missouri. He had also been a missionary in many capacities in Central and South America and founded the Freedom Valley Project in Ecuador&#x27;s Chota Valley.

On August 14, 2007, the General Contractor released the Certificate of Occupancy for the Health and Sciences Center (HSC). The HSC serves as the home for the Mark and Huldah Buntain School of nursing as well as the University Science Department&#x27;s chemistry, biology, environmental studies, and physics labs. The Northwest University Board of Directors unanimously supported the priority of the funding plan for the HSC, the largest fundraising program attempted by the university. Dr. Don Argue, the university president at the time, spearheaded the vision for the HSC. On May 8, 2009, Northwest University formally recognized the former president and current Chancellor for his efforts by naming the building &quot;The Donald H. Argue Health and Sciences Center&quot;. &quot;&#x27;The new Health and Sciences Center has surpassed our expectations, and we had very high hopes,&#x27; stated Dan Neary, Northwest&#x27;s Executive Vice President. &#x27;The classrooms and the laboratories have been a tremendous boost to both our science and our nursing programs. But even more, this building has become a popular site for conferences, meetings, and receptions. It has quickly become an integral part of our campus, and it&#x27;s difficult to even remember what it was like here before the HSC was finished!&#x27;&quot; No new buildings or major renovations have taken place since Dr. Argue&#x27;s departure.

In 2008 Salem Bible College (SBC) located in Salem, Oregon merged with Northwest University to become Salem Bible College of Northwest University.

In 2013, LEAP was renamed and expanded into the College of Adult and Professional Studies (CAPS). CAPS includes the Adult Evening Program, Church Partnership Program, Criminal Justice Program, Southern Idaho Extension Site, and Online Programs. The Adult Evening Program, Criminal Justice Program, and several extension sites have shrunk or closed.

The Church Partnership Program is now being called Northwest Partnership Program, as of 2018.

In 2020, facing declining numbers and a high turnover rate of deans in ministry, Northwest University cut tuition in half for ministry and theology majors. The program has yet to see an increase in numbers.

In 2022, after circulating an anti-LGBTQ+ email to faculty and staff and reaffirming their strict lifestyle policies, Northwest University was added to the Campus Pride &quot;Worst List&quot; for LGBTQ+ folks.

<text>A Landtag (State Diet) is generally the legislative assembly or parliament of a federated state or other subnational self-governing entity in German-speaking nations. It is usually a unicameral assembly exercising legislative competence in non-federal matters. 

The States of Germany and Austria are governed by &quot;Landtage&quot;. In addition, the legislature of the Italian autonomous province of South Tyrol is known in German as a &quot;Landtag&quot;. Historically, states of the German Confederation also established &quot;Landtage&quot;. The Landtag of Liechtenstein is the nation&#x27;s unicameral assembly.

== Name ==
The German word Landtag is composed of the words &quot;Land&quot; (state, country or territory) and &quot;Tag&quot; (day). The German word &quot;Tagung&quot; (meeting) is derived from the German word &quot;Tag&quot;, as such meetings were held at daylight and sometimes spanned several days.

== Historic Landtag assemblies ==
=== States of the Holy Roman Empire ===
In feudal society, the formal class system was reflected in the composition of the Imperial States&#x27; representative assemblies (&quot;Landstände&quot;), regardless of their name well described as estates of the realm: it was not intended as an elected reflection of public opinion, but a fixed expression of established power as recognized in formal privileges, including the right to be seated in person (granted to many nobles (knightage) and prelates, as well as certain cities) or to be represented as elector in a college that is entitled to one or more seats. Therefore, the representatives primarily defended class interests, and decisions were based on a class-based electoral system.

In some of the Imperial States that were known as &quot;Land&quot;, the name of such estates assembly was &quot;Landtag&quot;, analogous to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; (Imperial Diet), which mainly comprised most of the Princes of the Holy Roman Empire plus &quot;Reichsgrafen&quot;, Imperial prelates and Free imperial cities. The precise composition obviously varied greatly, and could change over time, as the result of privileges granted or lost, entities split or merged, border changes &quot;et cetera&quot;.

=== Prussia ===
Prussian Landtage were held:
*from 1466, in Royal Prussia. Before that, &quot;Prussian Landtag&quot; meetings were held in the Monastic state of the Teutonic Order. See also Prussian estates.
*from 1525, in Ducal Prussia.

See also Preußischer Landtag.

=== States of the German Confederation ===
As Austria and Prussia escaped the French &#x27;exporting the revolution&#x27;, and Napoleon was happy to maintain satellite monarchies in most German territories under his control (members of the Confederation of the Rhine), the more democratic principles of the Enlightenment would have less effect in the German-speaking lands, or only much later.

In 1815 the German Confederation (&quot;Deutscher Bund&quot;) was founded as successor to the Holy Roman Empire. § 13 of the &quot;Bundesakte&quot; (the constitution of the German Confederation) forced the German states to pass constitutions and implement parliaments called Landstände or Landtage.

The first constitution was passed in Nassau in 1814. Until 1841 (Luxembourg) all but two states got their constitution and parliaments.

=== States of the German Empire ===
In 1871 the German Empire was founded. All 25 states of the German Empire and Alsace-Lorraine (the &quot;Reichsland Elsaß-Lothringen&quot;) (from 1911) had Landtage as legislative authorities. The most important one was the &quot;Prussian Landtag&quot;.

=== States of the Weimar Republic ===
In the Weimar Republic (1919 – 1933) all German states had Landtage that were democratically elected by universal suffrage, and to which the state governments were responsible. After the Nazi seizure of power, they embarked on the process of &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; (coordination). On 31 March 1933, the &quot;Provisional Law on the Coordination of the States with the Reich&quot; was enacted, which dissolved all the sitting Landtage and reconstituted them on the basis of the recent &quot;Reichstag&quot; election results, which had given the Nazi Party and its coalition partner the DNVP a working majority. This was followed by the &quot;Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich&quot; of 30 January 1934 that formally abolished all the Landtage and transferred the sovereignty of the states to the central government. Although the states themselves continued in existence, the federalism of the Republic was effectively supplanted by a unitary state.

=== East Germany ===
Under its original constitution, East Germany was a federal republic with five Länder, each with its own Landtag. Each Landtag was responsible for electing the Chamber of States, the upper house of the national parliament.

In 1952, the Länder were dissolved and replaced by (districts). The Landtage were accordingly abolished and their functions transferred to the Bezirke governments. The Länder were eventually restored after the Peaceful Revolution, but their Landtage did not convene until after the reunification of Germany.

=== Finland ===
The Diet of Finland, which was created when the country was ceded from Sweden to Russia in 1809, was called in Swedish until 1906 when it was replaced by the unicameral Parliament of Finland. Parliament continued using the name in Swedish until 1919, when Finland adopted its first constitution following the declaration of independence in 1917. Since then, the official term in Swedish has been , equivalent of the German Reichstag. The Finnish name is .

=== Baltic countries ===
The first Landtag of the Livonian Confederation was called by archbishop of Riga Johannes Ambundii in 1419 and reconvened on a regular basis until the incorporation of Livonian lands into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Sweden and Denmark in 1561. Separate Landtags for Livonia, Courland and Estonia continued to exist as bodies of the Duchies of Livonia, Estonia, Courland and Semigallia, and later the Russian Governorates of Livonia, Estonia and Courland. After the independence of Estonia and Latvia in 1918, they were ultimately replaced by the Riigikogu and the Saeima.

== Modern legislatures ==
In the contemporary Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic of Austria and the Italian Republic&#x27;s province of South Tyrol (with a German-speaking majority), a Landtag is a unicameral legislature for a constitutive federal state (Bundesland).
In the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Landtag is the sole national parliament, because Liechtenstein has no federal structure due to its size.

=== German legislatures ===

In most of the German constitutive federal states (), the unicameral legislature is called &quot;Landtag&quot;:
*Landtag of Baden-Württemberg
*Landtag of Bavaria (until 1999, the large federal state of Bavaria was the only state with a bicameral legislature, with a lower house called the Landtag, and an upper house called the Senate)
*Landtag of Brandenburg
*Landtag of Hesse
*Landtag of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern
*Landtag of Lower Saxony
*Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia
*Landtag of Rhineland-Palatinate
*Landtag of Saarland
*Landtag of Saxony
*Landtag of Saxony-Anhalt
*Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein
*Landtag of Thuringia
In the German city states, the parliamentary city council serves the function of the state parliament within the federal system - in the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen and in the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg it is called the &quot;Bürgerschaft&quot; (municipal assembly):
*Bürgerschaft of Bremen
*Bürgerschaft of Hamburg
In the German capital and city state of Berlin, the legislature since 1951 (then of West Berlin) is called &quot;Abgeordnetenhaus&quot; (&quot;House of Representatives&quot;), adopting the tradition of the Prussian Landtag.

The national bicameral Parliament comprises the directly elected Bundestag and the Bundesrat which represents the state governments in Federal matters which affect the &quot;Länder&quot;.

=== Austrian legislatures ===
According to the Constitution of Austria, the &quot;Landtage&quot; are the unicameral legislatures of the nine states of Austria (), dealing with all matters not explicitly allotted to federal level:
* Landtag of Burgenland
* Landtag of Carinthia
* Landtag of Lower Austria
* Landtag of Upper Austria
* Landtag of Salzburg
* Landtag of Styria
* Landtag of Tyrol
* Landtag of Vorarlberg
As the Austrian capital Vienna (like Berlin) is both a city-state and a municipality, the Gemeinderat (municipal assembly) of Vienna also serves as the state Landtag. However, the city constitution states that municipal and state affairs are kept separate, and the two bodies hold separate meetings even though their memberships are identical.

The representatives are elected in general, free, secret and direct ballots according to the principle of proportional representation. The largest of the parliamentary groups (called &quot;Klubs&quot; in Austria) usually nominates the &quot;Landeshauptmann&quot; governor. The modern &quot;Landtage&quot; are the democratic successors of the estates assemblies in the corresponding crown lands of the Austrian Empire. Exceptions are the city of Vienna, which belonged to the Lower Austria Kronland until 1920, and Burgenland, ceded to Austria by the Kingdom of Hungary in 1921.

Austria&#x27;s national bicameral parliament consists of the directly elected National Council and the Federal Council, which represents the &quot;Landtage&quot; parliaments at the federal level. The two chambers meet in the Federal Assembly, held for the ceremonial swearing-in of the Austrian president.

<text>Lepe is a Spanish town in the province of Huelva, in the autonomous community of Andalusia. It is near the Portuguese border. According to the 2022 census, the city has a population of 28,617 inhabitants.

==Economy==
Until the late 1970s its economy was based on fishing but Lepe is now one of the wealthiest villages in the region thanks to its intensive farming of strawberries, which are exported all over Europe.

Lepe is known for its strawberries, and for Spanish jokes referring to its inhabitants as stupid.

==History==
Although deposits of Neolithic and Bronze Age have been found, there is no evidence of stable settlements in the municipality of Lepe. During the initial period of Roman rule, Lepe there was a rustic villa. There were fish farms at the present location of Lepe, Valsequillo and El Terrón. The retreat of the coast caused the abandonment of the settlement of Valsequillo, while fishing by El Terrón has continued until today. It is during the heyday of Roman rule when it blooms Lepe settlement located in a small village, linked to farming their fields and fishing port of El Terron. Based on classical texts, several authors have identified the current location of Lepe settlements with &quot;Laipe Megala&quot; (Rodrigo Caro, 1634), &quot;Laepa&quot; (García y Bellido, 1947; G. Bonsor, JP and E. Garrido Orta, 1922) and &quot;Praesidium&quot; (Luzon, 1975). Of all these options is &quot;Laepa&quot; which has more support among historians, although as a small country villa rather than a village itself. It is after the second wave of Arab conquests when Lepe becomes the economic center of the area, growing from a small farmhouse to a &quot;city about the Ocean Sea,&quot; as was described by the geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi later in the 1229. The name given during the period of Arab rule is &quot;Labb&quot;, which derives in the current name.

Several of Lepe’s former inhabitants played an important part in Christopher Columbus’s discovery of the Americas, as the sailor Rodrigo de Triana was the first to sight the coast of the Americas.

In the late 16th century, Marcos Alonso de la Garza left Lepe and settled in what is today the Mexican state of Durango, beginning a line of descendants, including Cpt. Blas María de la Garza Falcón, a conquistador of the state of Nuevo León.

==Main sights==
In the village is the 14th-century Iglesia de Santo Domingo de Guzmán built in the Mudéjar style. It houses Lepe&#x27;s patron saint, the Virgen de la Bella (Beautiful Virgin). Just outside the village, off the road to El Terrón, is the Ermita de Nuestra Señora de la Bella, a 14th-century hermitage dedicated to the Virgin. On the second Saturday in May there is a pilgrimage from Lepe to the hermitage, where the figure of the Virgen de la Bella is carried from the Iglesia de Santo Domingo to the Ermita.

Built under Philip II of Spain is the Torre del Catalán, a 16th-century lookout tower, used to warn of an impending invasion by Berber pirates. One can climb the tower for views of a nature reserve, the Paraje Natural Marismas del Río Piedras y la Flecha de Nueva Umbria.

Lepe&#x27;s main beach is La Antilla, 5 km south of Lepe. Located 5 km northeast of La Antilla and 5 km south of Lepe is the small fishing port of El Terrón. It has fine views across to El Rompido and the a nature reserve of the Marismas del Río Piedras. 

Lepe&#x27;s wines, which were exported to England in the Middle Ages, were mentioned in Chaucer&#x27;s The Canterbury Tales.

==Sport==

Lepe is home to San Roque de Lepe who play in the third division of Spanish football in the Segunda División B Group 4. The club play at Estadio Ciudad de Lepe, a purpose built stadium opened in 2011.

<doc id="422932" wikidata="Q441161" url="?curid=422932" title="Prince Buster">
<text>Cecil Bustamente Campbell (24 May 1938 – 8 September 2016), known professionally as Prince Buster, was a Jamaican singer-songwriter and producer. The records he released in the 1960s influenced and shaped the course of Jamaican contemporary music and created a legacy of work that would be drawn upon later by reggae and ska artists.

==Early life==
Cecil Bustamente Campbell was born in Orange Street in Kingston, Jamaica, on 24 May 1938. His middle name was given to him by his family in honour of the Labour activist and first post-Independence Prime Minister William Alexander Clarke Bustamante. In the early 1940s, Campbell was sent to live with his grandmother in rural Jamaica where his family&#x27;s commitment to the Christian faith, gave him his earliest musical experiences in the form of church singing as well as private family prayer and hymn meetings. Returning to live at Orange Street while still a young boy, Campbell attended the Central Branch School and St. Anne&#x27;s School.

While at school, Campbell performed three or four times a week at the Glass Bucket Club, as part of Frankie Lymon&#x27;s Sing and Dance Troupe; rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll-themed shows were popular during the 1950s, with the Glass Bucket Club establishing a reputation as the premier music venue and social club for Jamaican teenagers at that time. Upon leaving school he found himself drawn to the ranks of followers of sound system Tom the Great Sebastian. Jamaican sound systems at that time were playing American rhythm &#x27;n&#x27; blues and Campbell credits Tom the Great Sebastian with his first introduction to the songs and artists that would later influence his own music: The Clovers&#x27; &quot;Middle of the Night&quot;, Fats Domino&#x27;s &quot;Mardi Gras in New Orleans&quot;, the Griffin Brothers featuring Margie Day, and Shirley &amp; Lee.

==Career==
Campbell became more actively involved in the operational side of running a sound system after he was introduced to Clement &#x27;Coxsone&#x27; Dodd, a musically inclined businessman who operated one of Kingston&#x27;s most popular sound systems. Campbell found himself fulfilling a variety of roles for Coxsone: providing security, handling ticket receipts, identifying and sourcing music as well as working in the essential role of selector. The knowledge he gained about the financial and logistical aspects of staging a sound system dance was put to good use when Campbell made the decision to start his own sound system called &#x27;Voice of the People&#x27;. Campbell approached his family and a radio shop owner called Mr Wong for financial backing; both parties agreed. Campbell&#x27;s &#x27;Voice of the People&#x27; sound system was soon operational and within a short time had established itself as a rival to the sound systems of Coxsone and Duke Reid. Campbell applied to the Farm Work Program (guest worker scheme for the US agricultural sector) with the intention of buying music for his sound system but, on the day of departure, was refused entry into the scheme. Knowing that he would not be able to personally source records from the US, Campbell decided to record his own music. He approached Arkland &quot;Drumbago&quot; Parks, a professional drummer at the Baby Grand Club who had arranged and recorded a special (exclusive recording) for the Count Boysie sound system. Drumbago agreed to help and Campbell immediately began rehearsing with the musicians at the Baby Grand Club, including the guitarist Jah Jerry, who played on Campbell&#x27;s first recording session.

===1960s===
In 1961, Campbell released his first single &quot;Little Honey&quot; / &quot;Luke Lane Shuffle&quot; featuring Jah Jerry, Drumbago and Rico Rodriquez recording under the name of Buster&#x27;s Group. In that same year, he produced &quot;Oh Carolina&quot; by the Folkes Brothers, which was released on his Wild Bells label. The drumming on the record was provided by members of the Count Ossie Group, nyabinghi drummers from the Rastafarian community, Camp David, situated on the Wareika Hill above Kingston. After becoming a hit in Jamaica, &quot;Oh Carolina&quot; was licensed to Melodisc, a UK label owned by Emil Shalet. Melodisc released the track on their subsidiary label Blue Beat; the label would go on to become synonymous with 1960s ska releases for the UK market.

Campbell recorded prolifically throughout the 1960s; notable early ska releases include: &quot;Madness&quot; (1963), &quot;Wash Wash&quot; (1963, with Ernest Ranglin on bass), &quot;One Step Beyond&quot; (1964) and &quot;Al Capone&quot; (1964). The documentary &quot;This is Ska&quot; (1964), hosted by Tony Verity and filmed at the Sombrero Club, includes Campbell performing his Jamaican hit &quot;Wash Wash&quot;. In 1964, Campbell met World Heavyweight Champion boxer Muhammad Ali, who invited him to attend a Nation of Islam talk at Mosque 29 in Miami. That year Campbell joined the Nation of Islam and also started to release material, including a version of Louis X&#x27;s &quot;White Man&#x27;s Heaven is a Black Man&#x27;s Hell,&quot; on his own imprint label called &quot;Islam&quot;. In 1965, he appeared in &quot;Millie in Jamaica&quot; (a film short about Millie Small&#x27;s return to Jamaica after the world-wide success of &quot;My Boy Lollipop&quot;) which was broadcast on Rediffusion&#x27;s Friday evening pop show &quot;Ready, Steady, Go!&quot; Campbell had a top twenty hit in the UK with the single &quot;Al Capone&quot; (no. 18, February 1967). 
He toured the UK in spring 1967 appearing at the Marquee Club in May and later toured America to promote the RCA Victor LP release &quot;The Ten Commandments (From Man To Woman)&quot;.
&quot;Ten Commandments&quot; reached no. 81 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming his only hit single in the United States. By the late 1960s Campbell was once again at the forefront of a musical change in Jamaica; the new music would be called rocksteady. Campbell tracks like &quot;Shaking Up Orange Street&quot; (1967) were arranged with the slower, more soulful rocksteady template as used by Alton Ellis (&quot;Rock Steady&quot;) and many others. The album &quot;Judge Dread Rock Steady&quot; was released in 1967, and the title track &quot;Judge Dread&quot; with its satirical theme and vocal style proved to be popular to the point of parody. In 1968, the compilation album &quot;FABulous&quot; was released, opening with the track &quot;Earthquake&quot; (which revisited the theme of Orange Street) and including earlier hits. The album has regularly been reissued in the UK.

===1970s and beyond===
His career slowed up in the 1970s as the predominant style moved away from ska and rocksteady towards roots reggae, in part because as a Muslim he found it difficult to tailor his style towards a Rastafari audience. However he did make an appearance in the 1972 movie &quot;The Harder They Come&quot;, which featured Campbell in a cameo role as a DJ.

He subsequently moved to Miami to pursue business interests including running a jukebox company. From 1973 Campbell effectively retired from the music business, with only a handful of compilation albums issued. Even with the new interest in his music following the 2-Tone-led ska revival in the UK in 1979, he remained out of the limelight. Following an acclaimed appearance at the first Reggae Sunsplash event in July 1984 in London, he resumed performing with the Skatalites as his backing band towards the end of the 1980s, and resumed recording in 1992.

In 1994, a UK court ruled in favour of John Folkes and Greensleeves Records after they brought a lawsuit against Campbell and Melodisc (CampbelI by this time had acquired Melodisc) concerning authorship of &quot;Oh Carolina&quot;. Campbell had a top 30 hit in the UK with the track &quot;Whine and Grine&quot; (no. 21, April 1998) after the song had been used in an advert for Levi&#x27;s.

In 2001, Campbell was awarded the Order of Distinction by the Jamaican Government for his contribution to music. He performed at the 2002 Legends Of Ska festival in Toronto. Other appearances include: Sierra Nevada World Music Festival in 2003; the 2006 Boss Sounds Reggae Festival in Newcastle upon Tyne, the 40th Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland with the Delroy Williams Junction Band, and the 2007 UK Rhythm Festival. Campbell resided in Miami, Florida.

==Legacy==
The UK ska revival at the end of the 1970s that started with the 2-Tone label from Coventry introduced Campbell&#x27;s music to a new generation of listeners. In 1979 the band Madness released their first single on 2-Tone, a tribute to Campbell called &quot;The Prince&quot;. The B-side was a cover of the Campbell song &quot;Madness&quot; from which they took their name. Their second single, released on the Stiff label (&quot;The Prince&quot; would be the only single released by Madness on the 2-Tone label), was a cover of Campbell&#x27;s &quot;One Step Beyond&quot;, which reached the UK Top 10.

On their self-titled debut album, the Specials covered &quot;Too Hot&quot; and borrowed elements from Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Judge Dread&quot; (in the song &quot;Stupid Marriage&quot;) and &quot;Al Capone&quot; (in the song &quot;Gangsters&quot;). The Specials also included a cover of &quot;Enjoy Yourself&quot; on their second album &quot;More Specials&quot;.
The Beat covered &quot;Rough Rider&quot; and &quot;Whine &amp; Grine&quot; on their album &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Stop It&quot;. Campbell&#x27;s song &quot;Hard Man Fe Dead&quot; was covered by the U.S. ska band the Toasters on their 1996 album &quot;Hard Band For Dead&quot;.

In 2002, electronic duo Mint Royale sampled Prince Buster for their single &quot;Sexiest Man in Jamaica&quot; on their album &quot;Dancehall Places&quot;. In September 2002 the tune was released on David Wood and Neil Claxton&#x27;s Faith &amp; Hope Records label and debuted at #20 on the UK singles chart.

Filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn used Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Ten Commandments Of Man&quot; on the soundtrack of his 2019 television series &quot;Too Old to Die Young&quot;.

The Specials, with activist and vocalist Saffiyah Khan, recorded a rebuttal to &quot;Ten Commandments Of Man&quot;, also called &quot;10 Commandments&quot;, on their 2019 album &quot;Encore&quot;, criticising the original&#x27;s outdated representation of women.

Sex Pistols Steve Jones cited Prince Buster as an inspiration in his autobiography Lonely Boy.

==Death==
Campbell died on the morning of 8 September 2016, in a hospital in Miami, Florida, after suffering heart problems, according to his wife. He had reportedly been in poor health for some time after a series of strokes, including one in 2009 that left him unable to walk.

<text>Eisenstadt (; ; ; or ; ) is the capital city of the Austrian state of Burgenland. With a population of 15,074 (as of 2023), it is the smallest state capital and the 38th-largest city in Austria overall. It lies at the foot of the Leitha Mountains hill range.

From 1648 to 1921, Kismarton/Eisenstadt was part of the Habsburg Empire&#x27;s Kingdom of Hungary and the seat of the Hungarian noble family Eszterházy. During this time, the composer Joseph Haydn lived and worked in Eisenstadt as a court musician under the patronage of the Esterházy family. After the cessation of Burgenland to Austria in 1921, the city became the province&#x27;s capital in 1925. As the state capital of Burgenland, it functions as a center of public administration and services and is the seat of three institutes of higher education.

== Geography ==
Eisenstadt lies on a plain leading down to the river Wulka, at the southern foot of the Leitha Mountains, about from the Hungarian border.

=== Subdivisions ===
Eisenstadt is divided into three districts &quot;(Ortsteile)&quot;:
*Eisenstadt-Stadt (Eisenstadt proper)
* Kleinhöflein im Burgenland (; ) – a town that lies to the west of Eisenstadt proper
* St. Georgen am Leithagebirge (&quot;Lajtaszentgyörgy&quot;; &quot;Svetojurje&quot;) – a town that lies to the east of Eisenstadt proper

Furthermore, Eisenstadt is divided into five &quot;Katastralgemeinden&quot;:
* Eisenstadt-Stadt
* Oberberg, or Oberberg-Eisenstadt (; ) – the northern area of Eisenstadt starting beyond the Jewish quarter
* Unterberg, or Unterberg-Eisenstadt (&quot;Alsókismartonhegy&quot;; &quot;Željezno Donji Brig&quot;) – the southern area of Eisenstadt starting beyond the Kalvarienbergplatz &amp; the Ruster Straße and including the Jewish quarter
* Kleinhöflein im Burgenland
* St. Georgen am Leithagebirge

Other informal areas of the city include Wiesäcker and Lobäcker, which lie south of the Eisbach, a tributary of the Wulka. The city is surrounded by the district (&quot;Bezirk&quot;) of Eisenstadt-Umgebung.

The city previously included the districts &quot;(Ortsteile)&quot; of Eisenstadt-Stadt, Eisenstadt-Oberberg, Eisenstadt-Unterberg, and Eisenstadt-Schloßgrund (&quot;Kismartonváralja&quot;).

=== Nearby municipalities ===
* Großhöflein, Müllendorf, Steinbrunn, Neufeld/Leitha and Ebenfurth
* Hornstein
* Wulkaprodersdorf, Trausdorf/Wulka (on the Wulka and Eisbach)

=== Climate ===

==Names and etymology==
The city&#x27;s name means &quot;Iron City&quot; and was first recorded in 1118 as &quot;Castrum ferrum&quot;, referring to the history of iron mining and iron trade in the area. The first written mention of the town is from 1264 as &quot;minor Mortin&quot;, matching the Hungarian name, Kismarton, which recalls Martin of Tours, the patron saint of the main church.

== History ==
Archeological finds prove that the Eisenstadt area was already settled in the Hallstatt period. Celts and Romans settled somewhat later. During the Migration Period, the area was settled by different Germanic tribes and the Huns. Around 800, during the reign of Charlemagne, settlement by the Bavarii began. The territory became part of the Kingdom of Hungary in the 11th century.

The fortress built on the original earth works was destroyed by the troops of Margrave Leopold III of Austria. In 1241, it was destroyed by the Mongol invaders. In 1373, the town came into the possession of the Kanizsai family, who rebuilt the walls surrounding the town and built a fortress at the site of the present day castle between 1388 and 1392. In 1388, Eisenstadt was given the right to hold markets by Emperor Sigismund.

From 1440 Archduke Albert VI of Austria held the town as collateral for a loan. In 1451, Matthias Corvinus ceded it to Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor in return for the Holy Crown of Hungary. Matthias Corvinus reconquered it by force in 1482, but Maximilian I acquired it again in 1490. It remained under Habsburg rule until 1622; however, the Ottoman Empire briefly conquered Kismarton in 1529 and 1532 during their advances on the city of Vienna (see Ottoman wars in Europe). It was destroyed by fire in 1589.

In 1648, it passed under the rule of the Esterházy family. These Hungarian princes permanently changed the face of the city due to their extensive construction, especially on their castle, Schloss Esterházy. During this period, the city was captured by the army of Imre Thököly in 1683, and it saw the defeat of the rebel kuruc army of Sándor Károlyi by the Habsburgs in 1704. It was again destroyed by fire in 1776.

The appointment of Joseph Haydn as the prince&#x27;s &quot;Hofkapellmeister&quot; (court orchestra director, composing and performing music) began the great artistic period in the city&#x27;s history. In 1809, Eisenstadt was occupied by French troops during the Napoleonic Wars; in 1897, it was joined to the railway network.

Until the end of World War I, it was the seat of Kismarton district in Sopron county in the Kingdom of Hungary. Without plebiscite, the city and the entire Hungarian territory of Burgenland (with the exception of the city of Sopron and 11 other villages in which referendums were held) was annexed to Austria by the Saint-Germain and Treaties of Trianon in 1921. Since 30 April 1925, Eisenstadt has been the seat of the Burgenland state government and thus the state capital. During World War II, Eisenstadt was heavily bombarded. On 2 April 1945, it was captured by Soviet troops of the 3rd Ukrainian Front in the course of the Vienna Offensive, and the city remained under Soviet occupation until 1955. In 1960, it became the see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Eisenstadt.

== Politics ==
The current mayor of Eisenstadt is Thomas Steiner (ÖVP).

The district council is composed as follows ():
* Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP): 17 seats
* Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ): 8 seats
* Austrian Green Party (Grüne): 3 seats
* Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ): 1 seat

<text>In vector calculus, a vector potential is a vector field whose curl is a given vector field. This is analogous to a &quot;scalar potential&quot;, which is a scalar field whose gradient is a given vector field.

Formally, given a vector field formula_1, a &quot;vector potential&quot; is a formula_2 vector field formula_3 such that 
formula_4

==Consequence==
If a vector field formula_1 admits a vector potential formula_3, then from the equality 
formula_7
(divergence of the curl is zero) one obtains
formula_8
which implies that formula_1 must be a solenoidal vector field.

==Theorem==
Let
formula_10
be a solenoidal vector field which is twice continuously differentiable. Assume that formula_11 decreases at least as fast as formula_12 for formula_13. Define
formula_14
where formula_15 denotes curl with respect to variable formula_16. Then formula_3 is a vector potential for formula_1. That is,
formula_19

The integral domain can be restricted to any simply connected region formula_20. That is, formula_21 also is a vector potential of formula_1, where
formula_23

A generalization of this theorem is the Helmholtz decomposition theorem, which states that any vector field can be decomposed as a sum of a solenoidal vector field and an irrotational vector field.

By analogy with the Biot-Savart law, formula_24 also qualifies as a vector potential for formula_1, where

:formula_26.

Substituting formula_27 (current density) for formula_1 and formula_29 (H-field) for formula_3, yields the Biot-Savart law.

Let formula_20 be a star domain centered at the point formula_32, where formula_33. Applying Poincaré&#x27;s lemma for differential forms to vector fields, then formula_34 also is a vector potential for formula_1, where

formula_36

==Nonuniqueness==
The vector potential admitted by a solenoidal field is not unique. If formula_3 is a vector potential for formula_1, then so is
formula_39
where formula_40 is any continuously differentiable scalar function. This follows from the fact that the curl of the gradient is zero.

This nonuniqueness leads to a degree of freedom in the formulation of electrodynamics, or gauge freedom, and requires choosing a gauge.

<text>Gresham College is an institution of higher learning located at Barnard&#x27;s Inn Hall off Holborn in Central London, England that does not accept students or award degrees. It was founded in 1597 under the will of Sir Thomas Gresham, and hosts over 140 free public lectures every year. Since 2001, all lectures have been made available online. the Provost is Professor Martin Elliott.

==History==
===First four centuries===
Sir Thomas Gresham, founder of the Royal Exchange, left his estate jointly to the City of London Corporation and the Mercers&#x27; Company, which today support the college through the Joint Grand Gresham Committee under the presidency of the Lord Mayor of London. Gresham&#x27;s will provided for the setting up of the college – in Gresham&#x27;s mansion in Bishopsgate, on the site now occupied by Tower 42, the former NatWest Tower – and endowed it with the rental income from shops sited around the Royal Exchange.

The early success of the college led to the incorporation of the Royal Society in 1660, which pursued its activities at the college in Bishopsgate before moving to its own premises in Crane Court in 1710. Gresham College was mentioned &quot;particularly and academically&quot; alongside the Inns of Court and other colleges in London as part of a figurative University of London in Sir George Buck&#x27;s tract, &quot;The Third Universitie of England: Or a Treatise of the Foundations of all the Colledges, Auncient Schooles of Priviledge, and of Houses of Learning, and Liberall Arts, within and about the Most Famous Cittie of London&quot;, published in 1615 as an appendix to John Stow&#x27;s &quot;Annales&quot;. The 17th century saw various proposals for a third university in England, including one in London, taking in Gresham College. The college remained in Gresham&#x27;s mansion in Bishopsgate until 1768, and moved about London thereafter until the construction in 1842 of its own buildings in Gresham Street EC2. Gresham College did not become part of the University of London on the founding of the university in the 19th century, although a close association between the college and the university persisted for many years. In 1892 the foundation of a &#x27;Gresham University&#x27; in London was proposed in Parliament, intended to be a &quot;Teaching University worthy of this Metropolis.&quot; This was opposed by the Victoria University on the grounds that its medical faculty would dominate medical teaching in the country to the detriment of Manchester. The proposed university may just have borrowed the name from the college.

===21st century===
Since 1991, the college has operated at Barnard&#x27;s Inn Hall, Holborn EC1. Since 2000, the college regularly invites visiting speakers to deliver lectures on topics outside its usual range, and it also hosts occasional seminars and conferences. The college provides over 140 lectures a year, all open to the public free of charge.

Since 2001, the college has been recording its lectures and releasing them online in what is now an archive of over 2,000 lectures. Since 2007, lectures have also been available through YouTube, with 54 million views of 3,000 videos and 282,000 subscribers .

Annual lectures series of particular note hosted by the college include: the Gresham Special Lecture, the Annual Lord Mayor&#x27;s Event, and the Gray&#x27;s Inn Reading.

The college is a registered charity under English law.

==Professors==
The seven original Gresham College professorships that date back to the origins of the college are:

* Astronomy
* Divinity
* Geometry
* Law
* Music
* Physic
* Rhetoric

These original endowed chairs reflect the curriculum of the medieval university (the trivium and quadrivium); but as a place for the public and frequent voicing of new ideas, the college played an important role in the Enlightenment and in the formation of the Royal Society. Early distinguished Gresham College professors included Christopher Wren, who lectured on astronomy in the 17th century, and Robert Hooke, who was Professor of Geometry from 1665 until 1704.
 The professors received £50 a year, and the duties of their positions were specified tightly.

Today three further professorships have been added:

* Commerce, established in 1985.
* Environment, established in 2014.
* Information Technology, established in 2015.

The professors generally hold their positions for three years, extendable for a fourth year, and give six lectures a year. There are also regular visiting professors appointed to give series of lectures at the College, and a many single-lecture speakers.
==Gresham Special Lecture series==

<doc id="422948" wikidata="Q4861314" url="?curid=422948" title="Barn raising">
<text>A barn raising, also historically called a raising bee or rearing in the U.K., is a collective action of a community, in which a barn for one of the members is built or rebuilt collectively by members of the community. Barn raising was particularly common in 18th- and 19th-century rural North America. A barn was a necessary structure for any farmer, for example for storage of cereals and hay and keeping of animals. Yet a barn was also a large and costly structure, the assembly of which required more labor than a typical family could provide. Barn raising addressed the need by enlisting members of the community, unpaid, to assist in the building of their neighbors&#x27; barns. Because each member could ask others for help, reciprocation could eventually reasonably be presumed for each participant if the need were to arise.

The tradition of &quot;barn raising&quot; continues, more or less unchanged, in some Amish and Old Order Mennonite communities, particularly in Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and some rural parts of Canada. The practice continues outside of these religious communities, albeit less frequently than in the 19th century. Most frames today are raised using a crane and small crew.

== Description ==

A large amount of preparation is done before the one to two days a barn raising requires. Lumber and hardware are laid in, plans are made, ground is cleared, and tradesmen are hired. Materials are purchased or traded for by the family who will own the barn once it is complete.

Generally, participation is mandatory for community members. These participants are not paid. All able-bodied members of the community are expected to attend. Failure to attend a barn raising without the best of reasons leads to censure within the community. Some specialists brought in from other communities for direction or joinery may be paid, however.

One or more people with prior experience or with specific skills are chosen to lead the project. Older people who have participated in many barn raisings are crew chiefs. On the whole, the affair is well organized. At most barn raisings, the community members have raised barns before and approach the task with experience both in the individual tasks and the necessary organization. Young people participating physically for the first time have watched many barn raisings and know what is expected of them.

Only certain specialists are permitted to work on the more critical jobs, such as the joinery and doweling of the beams. (Post and beam construction is the traditional method of construction in barn raisings.) There is competition for these jobs, and they are sought after. Workers are differentiated by age and gender: men construct the barn, women provide water and food, the youngest children watch, and older boys are assigned to fetch parts and tools.

Most barn raisings were accomplished in June and July when the mostly agrarian society members had time between planting season and harvest season. Timber for the framing was mostly produced in the winter by the farmer and his crew hewing logs to the correct shape with axes or felling the trees and bringing them to a sawmill.

An ancient tradition is to place a bough, wreath and/or flag at the high point of the frame after the last piece is in place. This celebration is called topping out and historically the master carpenter may also make a speech and a toast.

== Social framework ==
In earlier American rural life, communities raised barns because many hands were required. In areas that were sparsely settled or on the edge of the frontier, it was not possible to hire carpenters or other tradesmen to build a barn. The harsher winters gave more urgency to the matter of barn construction than was present in the relatively milder climate in much of Europe. Similar conditions have given rise to similar institutions, such as the Finnish one of &#x27;talkoot&#x27;. As is clear from the account, for example, in Stevenson Whitcomb Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Pennsylvania Agriculture and Country Life 1640-1840,&quot; (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Historical Commission, p. 440 ff.), barn-raisings were typically occasions of community good-feeling, solidarity and festivity, as well as cooperative labor, and figured as part of a wider culture of neighborly mutual assistance (at harvest, for instance), sharing of tools and ox-teams, etc. Customarily the women of the families involved prepared hearty lunches for the builders and completion was celebrated with a feast and dance — often till dawn. Paid help was not a feature of these events.

Barn raisings occurred in a social framework with a good deal of interdependence. Members of rural communities often shared family bonds going back generations. They traded with each other, buying and selling land, labor, seed, cattle, and the like. They worshipped and celebrated together, because cities were too far away to visit with any frequency by horse and wagon.

== Contrast with church construction ==
Churches were considered as important to communities of the 18th and 19th centuries as barns. In like fashion, they were often constructed using unpaid community labor. There were important differences. Churches were not constructed with the same degree of urgency, and were most often built of native stone in some regions — a more durable material than the wood of which barns were made, and more time-consuming to lay. Barns, once completed, belonged to an individual family, while churches belonged to the community.

== Decline ==
Barn raising as a method of providing construction labor had become rare by the close of the 19th century. By that time, most frontier communities already had barns and those that did not were constructing them using hired labor. Mennonite and Amish communities carried on the tradition, however, and continue to do so to this day.

Group construction by volunteers enjoyed something of a resurgence during the 1970s, when houses, sheds, and barn-shaped structures were constructed for a variety of purposes. Echoes of the tradition can still be found in other community building projects, such as house building and renovation carried out by Habitat for Humanity.

<text>Sajeev John, OC, FRSC (born 1957) is a Professor of Physics at the University of Toronto and Canada Research Chair holder. He is known for his discovery of photonic crystals.

==Education and career==
He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics in 1979 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his Ph.D. in physics at Harvard University in 1984. His Ph.D. work at Harvard introduced the theory of classical wave localization and, in particular, the localization of light in three-dimensional strongly scattering dielectrics. From 1984–1986 he was a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, as well as a laboratory consultant to the Corporate Research Science Laboratories of Exxon Research and Engineering from 1985-1989.

From 1986-1989 he was an assistant professor of physics at Princeton University. In 1987, while at Princeton he co-invented, along with Eli Yablonovitch, the concept of a new class of materials with a photonic band gap called photonic crystals. This provided a fuller explanation of his original conception (1984) of the localization of light. He was a laboratory consultant to Bell Communications Research (Red Bank, NJ) in 1989. In the fall of 1989 he joined the senior physics faculty at the University of Toronto. He has been a Principal Investigator for Photonics Research Ontario and is a fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.

In 2011, John was selected as a Thomson-Reuters Citation Laureate. John was awarded the Killam Prize in Natural Sciences for 2014 by the Canada Council for the Arts. In 2017, he was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Canada &quot;For his revolutionary contributions to optical sciences, notably for his role in the development of new structures capable of harnessing the flow of light.&quot; In 2021, John was awarded the Herzberg Canada Gold Medal by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

Dr. John also received the 1996 Herzberg Medal for Physics and the 2007 Brockhouse Medal for Condensed Matter and Materials Physics from the Canadian Association of Physicists. He received the first ever McLean Fellowship from the University of Toronto in 1996, the 1997 Steacie Prize in Science and Engineering from the National Research Council of Canada, and the 2004 Rutherford Medal from the Royal Society of Canada. He is the first ever winner of Brockhouse Canada Prize in 2004, which he shared with materials chemist Geoffrey Ozin for their groundbreaking interdisciplinary work on photonic band gap materials synthesis. Professor John has also received the Killam Fellowship of the Canada Council for the Arts, the Guggenheim Fellowship (USA), the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Fellowship, and the Humboldt Senior Scientist Award (Germany). In 2007, Dr. John was awarded the C.V. Raman Chair Professorship of the Government of India. Prof. John is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, the Optical Society of America, the Royal Society of Canada, and a member of the Max Planck Society of Germany. He was the 2011 Elizabeth R.

<text>The RAD6000 radiation-hardened single-board computer, based on the IBM RISC Single Chip CPU, was manufactured by IBM Federal Systems. IBM Federal Systems was sold to Loral, and by way of acquisition, ended up with Lockheed Martin and is currently a part of BAE Systems Electronic Systems. RAD6000 is mainly known as the onboard computer of numerous NASA spacecraft.

==History==
The radiation-hardening of the original RSC 1.1 million-transistor processor to make the RAD6000&#x27;s CPU was done by IBM Federal Systems Division working with the Air Force Research Laboratory.

, there are 200 RAD6000 processors in space on a variety of NASA, United States Department of Defense and commercial spacecraft, including:
* Mars Exploration Rovers (&quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot;)
* Deep Space 1 probe
* Mars Polar Lander and Mars Climate Orbiter
* Mars Odyssey orbiter
* Spitzer Infrared Telescope Facility
* MESSENGER probe to Mercury
* STEREO Spacecraft
* IMAGE/Explorer 78 MIDEX spacecraft
* &quot;Genesis&quot; and &quot;Stardust&quot; sample return missions
* &quot;Phoenix&quot; Mars Polar Lander
* &quot;Dawn&quot; Mission to the asteroid belt using ion propulsion
* Solar Dynamics Observatory, Launched Feb 11, 2010 (flying both RAD6000 and RAD750)
* Burst Alert Telescope Image Processor on board the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission 
* DSCOVR Deep Space Climate Observatory spacecraft

The computer has a maximum clock rate of 33 MHz and a processing speed of about 35 MIPS. In addition to the CPU itself, the RAD6000 has 128 MB of ECC RAM. A typical real-time operating system running on NASA&#x27;s RAD6000 installations is VxWorks. The Flight boards in the above systems have switchable clock rates of 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 MHz.

Reported to have a unit cost somewhere between US$200,000 and US$300,000, RAD6000 computers were released for sale in the general commercial market in 1996.

The RAD6000&#x27;s successor is the RAD750 processor, based on IBM&#x27;s PowerPC 750.

<doc id="422982" wikidata="Q335529" url="?curid=422982" title="Frederick Spencer, 4th Earl Spencer">
<text>Vice-Admiral Frederick Spencer, 4th Earl Spencer, KG, CB, PC (14 April 1798 – 27 December 1857), styled The Honourable Frederick Spencer until 1845, was a British naval commander, courtier, and Whig politician. He initially served in the Royal Navy and fought in the Napoleonic Wars and the Greek War of Independence, eventually rising to the rank of Vice-Admiral. He succeeded his elder brother as Earl Spencer in 1845 and held political office as Lord Chamberlain of the Household between 1846 and 1848 and as Lord Steward of the Household between 1854 and 1857. In 1849 he was made a Knight of the Garter.

==Early life==
Spencer was born on 14 April 1798 at the Admiralty Building, London, and was baptised in St Martin-in-the-Fields. He was the fifth child born to George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer, and Lady Lavinia Bingham. Among his siblings was older brothers John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer (whose wife died in childbirth) and Sir Robert Cavendish Spencer, who died unmarried at sea. His older sister Lady Sarah Spencer was the wife of William Lyttelton, 3rd Baron Lyttelton.

His paternal grandparents were Home Secretary John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer, and his wife Margaret Georgiana Poyntz, daughter of the diplomat and courtier Stephen Poyntz. His maternal grandparents were Irish peer Charles Bingham, 1st Earl of Lucan, and his wife, the portrait miniature painter Margaret Smyth.

Spencer was educated at Eton from 1808 to 1811.

==Career==

Spencer then joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman on 18 September 1811, and fought in the Napoleonic Wars in the Mediterranean between 1811 and 1815. He served for a time under his brother, Captain the Hon. Robert Cavendish Spencer as a lieutenant aboard his ship , before receiving his own command, that of the brig on the South America Station. He was promoted to the rank of post-captain on 26 August 1822.

During the Greek War of Independence he commanded at the Battle of Navarino on 20 October 1827 and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in November of that year. The following year he fought with the Naval Brigade in the Morea expedition. For his actions he was made a Knight of the Order of St Louis of France and awarded the Order of St Anne of Russia and the Order of the Redeemer of Greece.

===Political career===
Spencer then retired from naval life and was elected Whig Member of Parliament for Worcestershire in 1831. He held this seat until 1832 and then represented Midhurst between 1832 and 1834 and again between 1837 and 1841. He was later an equerry in the household of the Duchess of Kent (Queen Victoria&#x27;s mother) from 1840 to 1845. The latter year he succeeded his elder brother in the earldom and took his seat in the House of Lords.

When the Whigs came to power under Lord John Russell in 1846, Lord Spencer was appointed Lord Chamberlain of the Household. He was sworn of the Privy Council the same year. He resigned as Lord Chamberlain in 1848 but returned to the government as Lord Steward of the Household in early 1854 under Lord Aberdeen, a post he held until shortly before his death in 1857, the last two years under the premiership of Lord Palmerston. He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1849.

He was also promoted to Rear-Admiral in 1852. and to Vice-Admiral (on the reserve list) in 1857.

==Personal life==

Lord Spencer was twice married. He married firstly his second cousin, Georgiana Poyntz (1799–1851), daughter of William Stephen Poyntz on 23 February 1830. They had three children:

*Lady Georgiana Frances Spencer (1832–1852), who died unmarried.
*John Poyntz Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer (1835–1910), who married Charlotte Seymour, a granddaughter of Vice-Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour and a first cousin of his stepmother Adelaide Seymour.
*Lady Sarah Isabella Spencer (1838–1919), who died unmarried.

After Georgiana&#x27;s death in 1851 he married, secondly, Adelaide Horatia Seymour (1825–1877), daughter of Sir Horace Seymour and a great-granddaughter of Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford, on 9 August 1854. They had two children:

*Lady Victoria Alexandrina Spencer (1855–1906), who married William Mansfield, 1st Viscount Sandhurst, and had issue.
*Charles Robert Spencer, 6th Earl Spencer (1857–1922), who married the Hon. Margaret Baring, daughter of Edward Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke.

Lord Spencer died at the family seat at Althorp, Brington, Northamptonshire, in December 1857, aged 59, and was succeeded in the earldom by his only son from his first marriage, John, who became a Liberal politician. Spencer&#x27;s son from his second marriage, Charles, who succeeded in the earldom in 1910, was also a Liberal politician. The Countess Spencer died at Guilsborough, Northamptonshire, in October 1877, aged 52. Lord Spencer was Lady Diana Spencer&#x27;s 2nd great grandfather.

<doc id="422990" wikidata="Q1323347" url="?curid=422990" title="Shunji Iwai">
<text>is a Japanese filmmaker, video artist, writer and documentary maker.

== Life and career ==
Iwai was born in Sendai, Miyagi, Japan. He attended Yokohama National University, graduating in 1987.

In 1988, he started out in the Japanese entertainment industry by directing TV dramas and music videos. In 1993, his television drama, &quot;Fireworks&quot;, brought him critical praise and the Directors Guild of Japan New Directors Award for his portrayal of a group of children in the town of Iioka.

In 1995, he went on to start his career in feature films, starting with the box-office hit &quot;Love Letter&quot;, in which he cast pop singer Miho Nakayama in dual roles. &quot;Love Letter&quot; also launched the film career of Miki Sakai who won a Japanese Academy Award as &#x27;Newcomer of the Year&#x27; for her portrayal of Itsuki Fujii as a young girl. Iwai collaborated with cinematographer Noboru Shinoda to produce a film praised for its evocative winter cinematography. &quot;Love Letter&quot; made an impact in other east Asian countries too, notably South Korea where the film&#x27;s success helped break down the post-World War II barriers to Japanese films being shown there.

In 1996, came the commercial and critical success of &quot;Swallowtail Butterfly&quot;, a multifaceted story of the fictional Yen Town, a city of immigrants in search of hope and a better life with three separate and distinct main characters. Ageha (Ayumi Ito), an orphaned teenage girl, Glico (Chara), a prostitute turned pop star, and Feihong (Hiroshi Mikami), an immigrant who manages Glico&#x27;s career and owns the Yen Town club. He also wrote the lyrics of a theme song for the film &quot;Swallowtail Butterfly (Ai no Uta)&quot; with Chara and Takeshi Kobayashi.

In 1998, Fine Line Features released &quot;Love Letter&quot; in the United States theatrically under the new title &quot;When I Close My Eyes&quot;; it was the first Iwai-directed film to be released in the United States theatrically.

Iwai enjoyed another kind of success with this film as well, having teamed up with Takeshi Kobayashi to create the music for the film and the Yen Town Band, headed by Pop star Chara. The band they created became a commercial hit in Japan. He would team up with Kobayashi again in 2001 for the harrowing High School Drama &quot;All About Lily Chou-Chou&quot;. Kobayashi would create the music for the titular pop star, Lily Chou-Chou (voiced by Japanese singer Salyu), that is spread through the film (as well as Debussy), and later be released as an album entitled &quot;Kokyu (Breathe)&quot;.

In 2002, he released a short, &quot;ARITA&quot;, in which he composed his own film score for the first time. In 2004 Iwai released &quot;Hana &amp; Alice&quot;, his first comedy. He once again composed the film score himself.

He has recently directed a commercial airing in Japan featuring Matsu Takako, whom he has not worked with since 1998.

October 2006 sees the Iwai-produced film &quot;Rainbow Song&quot; released in Japan. The film is directed by Naoto Kumazawa and was written by Ami Sakurai. It stars previous Iwai actors Hayato Ichihara, Yū Aoi and Shoko Aida. Also in 2006, Iwai spent time documenting and interviewing Kon Ichikawa while filming &quot;The Inugamis&quot; (&quot;Inugamike no ichizoku&quot;) to create a feature-length documentary about the director&#x27;s life.

A more recent project, a piece he wrote about the Japanese indie rock scene in the early 1990s called &quot;Bandage&quot;, was released on January 16, 2010. Apart from being in charge of the music production, &quot;Bandage&quot; represents Takeshi Kobayashi&#x27;s first time as a movie director. The project was originally taken by Ryuhei Kitamura, but was dropped in 2006. The filming started in 2008 and Kobayashi chose a completely different cast for the movie, casting J-pop singer Jin Akanishi and Kie Kitano for the main roles. It also included other actors who have worked with Iwai before, such as Ayumi Ito and Hideyuki Kasahara. The release of the horror film &quot;Vampire&quot; marked his English-language film debut.

<text>A digital object identifier (DOI) is a persistent identifier or handle used to uniquely identify various objects, standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISE). DOIs are an implementation of the Handle System; they also fit within the URI system (Uniform Resource Identifier). They are widely used to identify academic, professional, and government information, such as journal articles, research reports, data sets, and official publications.

A DOI aims to resolve to its target, the information object to which the DOI refers. This is achieved by binding the DOI to metadata about the object, such as a URL where the object is located. Thus, by being actionable and interoperable, a DOI differs from ISBNs or ISRCs which are identifiers only. The DOI system uses the indecs Content Model to represent metadata.

The DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document, whereas its location and other metadata may change. Referring to an online document by its DOI should provide a more stable link than directly using its URL. But if its URL changes, the publisher must update the metadata for the DOI to maintain the link to the URL. It is the publisher&#x27;s responsibility to update the DOI database. If they fail to do so, the DOI resolves to a dead link, leaving the DOI useless.

The developer and administrator of the DOI system is the International DOI Foundation (IDF), which introduced it in 2000. Organizations that meet the contractual obligations of the DOI system and are willing to pay to become a member of the system can assign DOIs. The DOI system is implemented through a federation of registration agencies coordinated by the IDF. The cumulative number of DOIs has increased exponentially over time, from 50 million registrations in 2011 to 391 million in 2025. The rate of registering organizations (&quot;members&quot;) has also increased over time from 4,000 in 2011 to 9,500 in 2013, but the federated nature of the system means it&#x27;s not immediately clear how many members there are in total today.Fake registries have even appeared.

== Nomenclature and syntax==
A DOI is a type of Handle System handle, which takes the form of a character string divided into two parts, a prefix and a suffix, separated by a slash.
: codice_1

The prefix identifies the registrant of the identifier and the suffix is chosen by the registrant and identifies the specific object associated with that DOI. Most legal Unicode characters are allowed in these strings, which are interpreted in a case-insensitive manner. The prefix usually takes the form codice_2, where codice_3 is a number greater than or equal to codice_4, whose limit depends only on the total number of registrants. The prefix may be further subdivided with periods, like codice_5.

For example, in the DOI name codice_6, the prefix is codice_7 and the suffix is codice_8. The &quot;10&quot; part of the prefix distinguishes the handle as part of the DOI namespace, as opposed to some other Handle System namespace, and the characters codice_4 in the prefix identify the registrant; in this case the registrant is the International DOI Foundation itself. codice_8 is the suffix, or item ID, identifying a single object (in this case, the latest version of the &quot;DOI Handbook&quot;).

DOI names can identify creative works (such as texts, images, audio or video items, and software) in both electronic and physical forms, performances, and abstract works such as licenses, parties to a transaction, etc.

The names can refer to objects at varying levels of detail: thus DOI names can identify a journal, an individual issue of a journal, an individual article in the journal, or a single table in that article. The choice of level of detail is left to the assigner, but in the DOI system it must be declared as part of the metadata that is associated with a DOI name, using a data dictionary based on the indecs Content Model.

===Display===
The official &quot;DOI Handbook&quot; explicitly states that DOIs should be displayed on screens and in print in the format codice_11.

Contrary to the &quot;DOI Handbook&quot;, Crossref, a major DOI registration agency, recommends displaying a URL (for example, codice_12) instead of the officially specified format. This URL is persistent (there is a contract that ensures persistence in the doi.org domain,) so it is a PURL—providing the location of an name resolver which will redirect HTTP requests to the correct online location of the linked item.

The Crossref recommendation is primarily based on the assumption that the DOI is being displayed without being hyperlinked to its appropriate URL—the argument being that without the hyperlink it is not as easy to copy-and-paste the full URL to actually bring up the page for the DOI, thus the entire URL should be displayed, allowing people viewing the page containing the DOI to copy-and-paste the URL, by hand, into a new window/tab in their browser in order to go to the appropriate page for the document the DOI represents.

==Content==
Major content of the DOI system currently includes:
* Scholarly materials (journal articles, books, ebooks, etc.) through Crossref, a consortium of around 3,000 publishers; Airiti, a leading provider of Chinese and Taiwanese electronic academic journals; and the Japan Link Center (JaLC) an organization providing link management and DOI assignment for electronic academic journals in Japanese.
* Research datasets through DataCite, a consortium of leading research libraries, technical information providers, and scientific data centers;
* European Union official publications through the EU publications office;
* The Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure project at Tsinghua University and the Institute of Scientific and Technical Information of China (ISTIC), two initiatives sponsored by the Chinese government.
* Permanent global identifiers for both commercial and non-commercial audio/visual content titles, edits, and manifestations through the Entertainment ID Registry, commonly known as EIDR.

In the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&#x27;s publication service OECD iLibrary, each table or graph in an OECD publication is shown with a DOI name that leads to an Excel file of data underlying the tables and graphs. Further development of such services is planned.

Other registries include Crossref and the &quot;multilingual European DOI Registration Agency (mEDRA)&quot;. Since 2015, RFCs can be referenced as codice_13.

==Features and benefits==
The IDF designed the DOI system to provide a form of persistent identification, in which each DOI name permanently and unambiguously identifies the object to which it is associated (although when the publisher of a journal changes, sometimes all the DOIs will be changed, with the old DOIs no longer working). It also associates metadata with objects, allowing it to provide users with relevant pieces of information about the objects and their relationships. Included as part of this metadata are network actions that allow DOI names to be resolved to web locations where the objects they describe can be found. To achieve its goals, the DOI system combines the Handle System and the indecs Content Model with a social infrastructure.

The Handle System ensures that the DOI name for an object is not based on any changeable attributes of the object such as its physical location or ownership, that the attributes of the object are encoded in its metadata rather than in its DOI name, and that no two objects are assigned the same DOI name. Because DOI names are short character strings, they are human-readable, may be copied and pasted as text, and fit into the URI specification. The DOI name-resolution mechanism acts behind the scenes, so that users communicate with it in the same way as with any other web service; it is built on open architectures, incorporates trust mechanisms, and is engineered to operate reliably and flexibly so that it can be adapted to changing demands and new applications of the DOI system. DOI name-resolution may be used with OpenURL to select the most appropriate among multiple locations for a given object, according to the location of the user making the request. However, despite this ability, the DOI system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users to non-free copies of documents, that would have been available for no additional fee from alternative locations.

The indecs Content Model as used within the DOI system associates metadata with objects. A small kernel of common metadata is shared by all DOI names and can be optionally extended with other relevant data, which may be public or restricted. Registrants may update the metadata for their DOI names at any time, such as when publication information changes or when an object moves to a different URL.

The International DOI Foundation (IDF) oversees the integration of these technologies and operation of the system through a technical and social infrastructure. The social infrastructure of a federation of independent registration agencies offering DOI services was modelled on existing successful federated deployments of identifiers such as GS1 and ISBN.

==Comparison with other identifier schemes==
A DOI name differs from commonly used Internet pointers to material, such as the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), in that it identifies an object itself as a first-class entity, rather than the specific place where the object is located at a certain time. It implements the Uniform Resource Identifier (Uniform Resource Name) concept and adds to it a data model and social infrastructure.

A DOI name also differs from standard identifier registries such as the ISBN, ISRC, etc. The purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers, whereas the primary purpose of the DOI system is to make a collection of identifiers actionable and interoperable, where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections.

The DOI system offers persistent, semantically interoperable resolution to related current data and is best suited to material that will be used in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner (e.g., public citation or managing content of value). It uses a managed registry (providing both social and technical infrastructure). It does not assume any specific business model for the provision of identifiers or services and enables other existing services to link to it in defined ways. Several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed.

The comparison of persistent identifier approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing. Imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as &quot;identifiers&quot; does not mean that they can be compared easily. Other &quot;identifier systems&quot; may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry, providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance (examples include Persistent Uniform Resource Locator (PURL), URLs, Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs), etc.), but may lack some of the functionality of a registry-controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme.

The DOI system does not have this approach and should not be compared directly to such identifier schemes. Various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some of the features offered by the DOI system for specific sectors (e.g., ARK).

A DOI name does not depend on the object&#x27;s location and, in this way, is similar to a Uniform Resource Name (URN) or PURL but differs from an ordinary URL. URLs are often used as substitute identifiers for documents on the Internet although the same document at two different locations has two URLs. By contrast, persistent identifiers such as DOI names identify objects as first class entities: two instances of the same object would have the same DOI name.

==Resolution==
DOI name resolution is provided through the Handle System, developed by Corporation for National Research Initiatives, and is freely available to any user encountering a DOI name. Resolution redirects the user from a DOI name to one or more pieces of typed data: URLs representing instances of the object, services such as e-mail, or one or more items of metadata. To the Handle System, a DOI name is a handle, and so has a set of values assigned to it and may be thought of as a record that consists of a group of fields. Each handle value must have a data type specified in its codice_14 field, which defines the syntax and semantics of its data. While a DOI persistently and uniquely identifies the object to which it is assigned, DOI resolution may not be persistent, due to technical and administrative issues.

To resolve a DOI name, it may be input to a DOI resolver, such as doi.org.

Another approach, which avoids typing or copying and pasting into a resolver is to include the DOI in a document as a URL which uses the resolver as an HTTP proxy, such as codice_15 (preferred) or codice_16, both of which support HTTPS. For example, the DOI codice_6 can be included in a reference or hyperlink as codice_12. This approach allows users to click on the DOI as a normal hyperlink. Indeed, as previously mentioned, this is how Crossref recommends that DOIs always be represented (preferring HTTPS over HTTP), so that if they are cut-and-pasted into other documents, emails, etc., they will be actionable.

Other DOI resolvers and HTTP Proxies include the Handle System and PANGAEA. At the beginning of the year 2016, a new class of alternative DOI resolvers was started by http://doai.io. This service is unusual in that it tries to find a non-paywalled (often author archived) version of a title and redirects the user to that instead of the publisher&#x27;s version. Since then, other open-access favoring DOI resolvers have been created, notably https://oadoi.org/ in October 2016 (later Unpaywall). While traditional DOI resolvers solely rely on the Handle System, alternative DOI resolvers first consult open access resources such as BASE (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine).

An alternative to HTTP proxies is to use one of a number of add-ons and plug-ins for browsers, thereby avoiding the conversion of the DOIs to URLs, which depend on domain names and may be subject to change, while still allowing the DOI to be treated as a normal hyperlink. A disadvantage of this approach for publishers is that, at least at present, most users will be encountering the DOIs in a browser, mail reader, or other software which does not have one of these plug-ins installed.

==IDF organizational structure==

The International DOI Foundation (IDF), a non-profit organization created in 1997, is the governance body of the DOI system. It safeguards all intellectual property rights relating to the DOI system, manages common operational features, and supports the development and promotion of the DOI system. The IDF ensures that any improvements made to the DOI system (including creation, maintenance, registration, resolution and policymaking of DOI names) are available to any DOI registrant. It also prevents third parties from imposing additional licensing requirements beyond those of the IDF on users of the DOI system.

The IDF is controlled by a Board elected by the members of the Foundation, with an appointed Managing Agent who is responsible for co-ordinating and planning its activities. Membership is open to all organizations with an interest in electronic publishing and related enabling technologies. The IDF holds annual open meetings on the topics of DOI and related issues.

Registration agencies, appointed by the IDF, provide services to DOI registrants: they allocate DOI prefixes, register DOI names, and provide the necessary infrastructure to allow registrants to declare and maintain metadata and state data. Registration agencies are also expected to actively promote the widespread adoption of the DOI system, to cooperate with the IDF in the development of the DOI system as a whole, and to provide services on behalf of their specific user community. A list of current RAs is maintained by the International DOI Foundation. The IDF is recognized as one of the federated registrars for the Handle System by the DONA Foundation (of which the IDF is a board member), and is responsible for assigning Handle System prefixes under the top-level codice_19 prefix.

Registration agencies generally charge a fee to assign a new DOI name; parts of these fees are used to support the IDF. The DOI system overall, through the IDF, operates on a not-for-profit cost recovery basis.

==Standardization==
The DOI system is an international standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization in its technical committee on identification and description, TC46/SC9. The Draft International Standard ISO/DIS 26324, &quot;Information and documentation – Digital Object Identifier System&quot; met the ISO requirements for approval. The relevant ISO Working Group later submitted an edited version to ISO for distribution as an FDIS (Final Draft International Standard) ballot, which was approved by 100% of those voting in a ballot closing on 15 November 2010. The final standard was published on 23 April 2012.

DOI is a registered URI under the info URI scheme specified by IETF . info:doi/ is the infoURI Namespace of Digital Object Identifiers.

The DOI syntax is a NISO standard, first standardized in 2000, ANSI/NISO Z39.84-2005 Syntax for the Digital Object Identifier.

The maintainers of the DOI system have deliberately not registered a DOI namespace for URNs, stating that:

<text>Round-the-pole flying (RTP) is a form of flying model aircraft, in which the model is attached via a line from its wingtip or fuselage to a central support structure. Control signals can be passed to the model via wires alongside or integral with the attachment line. The operator can control the aircraft using a control console, situated outside the flying circle of the aircraft. Contrast this to control line flying where the pilot/operator stands at the centre of the flying circle and directly supports the aircraft.

RTP can be used indoors or outdoors, though usually requires calm wind conditions if used outdoors. The power source for the model is usually an electric motor, since the power can be supplied via the line and heavy batteries need not be carried. This makes it particularly quiet, clean and suitable for indoor flying. Conventional engines can be used outdoors.

The pole itself is usually a simple stand heavy enough to withstand the centrifugal forces on it. The head of the pole needs to provide a freely rotating hub, and usually incorporates a ball bearing race of some kind. In addition, where signals and power need to pass to the model, some form of slip ring arrangement is required.

Models for RTP can range from the very simple, usually converted from rubber-band powered models, to sophisticated true scale designs. The use of electric power can permit sophisticated control effects such as retracting undercarriage, operating flaps, etc. However the limited degree of freedom of the tethered model precludes the use of full aerodynamic control. Climb and descent are usually effected using variations in power to the motors.

The control console can be nothing more than a simple rheostat allowing the current supplied to the model to be varied. More sophisticated control consoles can be envisaged.

Typical RTP set-ups allow multiple models to fly simultaneously on the same pole. This allows such activities as formation flying and dogfights to take place. A kill in a dogfight is achieved by damaging the opponent&#x27;s model with the propeller of the attacking model. Alternatively a paper streamer can be trailed behind each model and a kill is confirmed when the streamer has been successfully destroyed.

Other challenges such as flying under, over and between bars, popping balloons and loop the loop can also be attempted.

A yearly RTP Contest is held in Lake Tahoe, California. Called the Aaroone Cup, it requires 0.020 engines and is a speed and Concours d&#x27;Elegance contest. Record speeds exceed 60 mph on the 10-foot steel line.

== Round-the-pole flying with Radio Control ==
There is another concept of RTP flying. This concept is with throttle and elevator control. This was invented by the model building club &quot; kottenpark modelbouw club (in Dutch). This is done by using a normal RC-controller. In the pole is a RC-receiver including a RC-servo for controlling the elevator and a speed controller for regulation the electrical motor in the aircraft.

Elevator control and the electrical motor control is done with 2 electrical wires from the pole to the model aircraft. The elevator control is done by shortening one wire while simultaneously lengthening the other wire. This motion is converted in the model aircraft to control the elevator.

The whole idea behind this setup is to learn flying with remote control, because you have only 2 degrees of freedom.

<text>USS &quot;H-1&quot; (SS-28), the lead ship of her class of submarine of the United States Navy, was originally named &quot;Seawolf&quot;, making her the first ship of the U.S. Navy to be named for the seawolf.

&quot;Seawolf&quot; was laid down by the Union Iron Works of San Francisco, California. She was renamed on 17 November 1911, launched on 6 May 1913 sponsored by Miss Lesley Jean Makins, and commissioned at Mare Island Navy Yard on 1 December 1913.

==Service history==
The new submarine was attached to Torpedo Flotilla 2, Pacific Fleet, and operated along the West Coast out of San Pedro, California. During various exercises and patrols, she traveled the coast from Los Angeles, California to lower British Columbia, often in company with her sister ships and sometimes .

Sailing from San Pedro, California on 17 October 1917, she reached New London, Connecticut on 8 November. For the remainder of World War I, she was based there and patrolled Long Island Sound, frequently with officer students from the submarine school on board.

&quot;H-1&quot; and &quot;H-2&quot; sailed for San Pedro, California on 6 January 1920, transiting the Panama Canal on 20 February. On 12 March, as &quot;H-1&quot; made her way up the coast of Mexico&#x27;s Baja California Peninsula, she ran aground on a shoal off Magdalena Bay.

Four men, including the commanding officer, died trying to reach shore. The diesel freighter on her maiden voyage for the California &amp; Mexico Steamship Company (also this line&#x27;s inaugural voyage), tried to pull the submarine into deep water, and then carried 22 survivors to San Pedro where they arrived on March 18. pulled &quot;H-1&quot; off the rocks in the morning of 24 March, but in only 45 minutes, the submarine sank in some of water. Further salvage effort was abandoned. Her name was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 April, and she was sold for scrap in June 1920, but never recovered.

In 2019, her wreck was identified south of Baja California.

<doc id="423005" wikidata="Q967901" url="?curid=423005" title="Howard Devoto">
<text>Howard Devoto (born Howard Andrew Trafford, 15 March 1952) is an English singer and songwriter, who began his career as the frontman for punk rock band Buzzcocks, but then left to form Magazine, an early post-punk band. After Magazine, he went solo and later formed indie band Luxuria.

His singing has been characterized as a &quot;speak-sing voice that veered between amused croon and panicked yelp&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Scunthorpe, Devoto grew up in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, and Moortown, Leeds, where he attended Leeds Grammar School and met and befriended future Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon. In 1972, he went to Bolton Institute of Technology (now the University of Bolton) to study psychology, and, later, humanities. During these college years, he met his future bandmates Pete Shelley and Ben Mandelson. He picked the stage name &quot;Devoto&quot; before meeting Shelley from the name of a friend of his landlord called &quot;Andy Devoto&quot;.

===Buzzcocks===
Inspired by the Sex Pistols, Devoto co-formed Buzzcocks with singer/guitarist Pete Shelley in 1976. He left the band in February 1977 after only one record (the &quot;Spiral Scratch&quot; EP) and a small number of performances to form the band Magazine.

===Magazine===
Devoto formed the post-punk band Magazine in 1977. They released several critically acclaimed albums, which met with moderate commercial success, as well as minor hits such as &quot;Shot by Both Sides&quot; and &quot;A Song from Under the Floorboards&quot;. Magazine reformed in February 2009, initially performing on a tour of five dates, and subsequently continued playing live and began to record new material. A studio album, &quot;No Thyself&quot;, was released in October 2011.

===Solo years===

After Magazine split in 1981 Devoto spent two years putting together a solo album with former Magazine keyboard player Dave Formula. &quot;Jerky Versions of the Dream&quot; reached No. 57 in the UK Albums Chart in August 1983, and was reissued in 2007 by Virgin/EMI, featuring several tracks of bonus material.

===Collaborations===

A collaboration on three songs with Bernard Szajner on the &quot;Brute Reason&quot; LP was released on Island Records in 1983. This was followed by a rendering of Big Star&#x27;s &quot;Holocaust&quot; for the loose collective This Mortal Coil. The album &quot;It&#x27;ll End in Tears&quot; contained contributions from many of the 4AD label&#x27;s best artists, Devoto&#x27;s presence being somewhat atypical.

In 1997, Devoto wrote the lyrics to the Mansun track &quot;Everyone Must Win&quot;, which appeared on the &quot;Closed for Business&quot; EP. A year later he collaborated again with the band, writing lyrics for and singing on &quot;Railings&quot;, a B-side for &quot;Being a Girl (Part One)&quot;.

===Luxuria===
One of his next projects was a 1988 collaboration with Liverpool multi-instrumentalist Noko. As Luxuria they released two albums and a music video for the single &quot;Redneck&quot;.

===Life after popular music===
For most of the 1990s Devoto was little involved in music, earning his living by working for a photo agency.

In 2001, he teamed up with Buzzcocks colleague Pete Shelley for the first time in twenty-five years, and released the much-anticipated &quot;Buzzkunst&quot; under the name ShelleyDevoto. Reviews were mixed.

In 2002, Devoto had a small part in the movie &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot;, a film about Manchester&#x27;s Factory Records. In his brief cameo appearance, Devoto appears as a caretaker cleaning a men&#x27;s toilet while actor Martin Hancock portrays Devoto having a tryst with the wife of promoter/journalist Tony Wilson. The real-life Devoto breaks the fourth wall by addressing the camera and stating, deadpan, &quot;I &quot;definitely&quot; don&#x27;t remember this happening&quot;.

Magazine reformed in February 2009, with former Luxuria partner Noko replacing the deceased John McGeoch on guitar.

On 9 July 2009, Devoto was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Bolton for his contribution to music.

===Reunion with Buzzcocks===
In November 2011, it was announced he would be returning to the stage with Buzzcocks for two special shows as part of the Buzzcocks &quot;Back to Front&quot; tour on 25 and 26 May 2012. These took place at the O2 Apollo in Manchester and the O2 Academy in Brixton 

==Tributes, references and cover songs==
A number of bands continue to be influenced by his work. Momus recorded the tribute song &quot;The Most Important Man Alive&quot; for the Bungalow Records compilation &quot;Suite 98&quot; in 1998. Mansun have covered &quot;Shot by Both Sides&quot; live, and recorded it on their fourth and final album &quot;Kleptomania&quot;. Also Radiohead and Jarvis Cocker have both covered &quot;Shot by Both Sides&quot;. Both Ministry and Peter Murphy have covered Magazine&#x27;s &quot;The Light Pours Out of Me&quot;, whilst Simple Minds, My Friend The Chocolate Cake, Morrissey and Strange Boutique have covered Magazine&#x27;s &quot;A Song from Under the Floorboards&quot;.

<text>The Irish National Land League (Irish: &quot;Conradh na Talún&quot;), also known as the Land League, was an Irish political organisation of the late 19th century which organised tenant farmers in their resistance to exactions of landowners. Its primary aim was to abolish landlordism in Ireland and enable tenant farmers to own the land they worked on. The period of the Land League&#x27;s agitation is known as the Land War. Historian R. F. Foster argues that in the countryside the Land League &quot;reinforced the politicization of rural Catholic nationalist Ireland, partly by defining that identity against urbanization, landlordism, Englishness and—implicitly—Protestantism.&quot; Foster adds that about a third of the activists were Catholic priests, and Archbishop Thomas Croke was one of its most influential champions.

==Background==

Following the founding meeting of the Mayo Tenants Defence Association in Castlebar, County Mayo on 26 October 1878 the demand for The Land of Ireland for the people of Ireland was reported in the &quot;Connaught Telegraph&quot; 2 November 1878.

The first of many &quot;monster meetings&quot; of tenant farmers was held in Irishtown near Claremorris on 20 April 1879, with an estimated turnout of 15,000 to 20,000 people. This meeting was addressed by James Daly (who presided), John O&#x27;Connor Power, John Ferguson, Thomas Brennan, and J. J. Louden.

The &quot;Connaught Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s report of the meeting in its edition of 26 April 1879 began:

Since the days of O&#x27;Connell a larger public demonstration has not been witnessed than that of Sunday last. About 1 o&#x27;clock the monster procession started from Claremorris, headed by several thousand men on foot – the men of each district wearing a laurel leaf or green ribbon in hat or coat to distinguish the several contingents. At 11 o&#x27;clock a monster contingent of tenant farmers on horseback drew up in front of Hughes&#x27;s hotel, showing
discipline and order that a cavalry regiment might feel proud of. They were led on in sections, each having a marshal who kept his troops well in hand. Messrs. P.W. Nally, J.W. Nally, H. French, and M. Griffin, wearing green and gold sashes, led on their different sections, who rode two deep, occupying, at least, over an Irish mile of the road. Next followed a train of carriages, brakes, cares, etc. led on by Mr. Martin Hughes, the spirited hotel proprietor, driving a pair of rare black ponies to a phæton, taking Messrs. J.J. Louden and J. Daly. Next came Messrs. O&#x27;Connor, J. Ferguson, and Thomas Brennan in a covered carriage, followed by at least 500 vehicles from the neighbouring towns. On passing through Ballindine the sight was truly imposing, the endless train directing its course to Irishtown – a neat little hamlet on the boundaries of Mayo, Roscommon, and Galway.

Evolving out of this a number of local land league organisations were set up to work against the excessive rents being demanded by landlords throughout Ireland, but especially in Mayo and surrounding counties.

From 1874 agricultural prices in Europe had dropped, followed by some bad harvests due to wet weather during the Long Depression. The effect by 1878 was that many Irish farmers were unable to pay the rents that they had agreed, particularly in the poorer and wetter parts of Connacht. The localised 1879 Famine added to the misery. Unlike many other parts of Europe, the Irish land tenure system was inflexible in times of economic hardship.

In January 1874, there had been an attempt to revive what the Young Irelander Charles Gavan Duffy had hailed as the &quot;League of North and South&quot;.In 1852, the Tenant Right League had helped return 48 MPs to Westminster where they briefly cohered as the Independent Irish Party. The initiative in 1874 came from largely Presbyterian tenant righters in the north. The Route Tenants Defence Association (Ballymoney) organised an all-Ireland National Tenants Rights conference in Belfast. In addition to the &quot;Three F&#x27;s&quot; (fair rent fixity of tenure, and free sales), resolutions called for loans to facilitate tenant purchase of land and for breaking the landlord monopoly on local government. 

Once again there was a determination to organise parliamentary constituencies so as to return Members pledged to tenant rights. But, as in the 1850s, the &quot;shared dislike for, or hostility to, landlords, and a common desire for improved tenurial terms&quot; could not overcome the sectarian-aligned division over Irish self-government between the Repeal Association, or now in 1874 the Home Rule League, parliamentary candidates who adopted the tenant programme in the south and west, and the majority of the Liberals who championed it in the north.

==League founded==
The Irish National Land League was founded at the Imperial Hotel in Castlebar, the County town of Mayo, on 21 October 1879. At that meeting Charles Stewart Parnell, the prominent Home Rule Member of Parliament, was elected president of the league. Andrew Kettle, Michael Davitt and Thomas Brennan were appointed as honorary secretaries. This united practically in a single organisation all the different strands of land agitation and tenant rights movements on the &quot;nationalist&quot; side of the increasingly frozen sectarian-political divide in Ireland. 
The key motion at the Dublin meeting was proposed by Parnell. It proposed that the objectives of the League were:

... first, to bring about a reduction of rack-rents; second, to facilitate the obtaining of the ownership of the soil by the occupiers [and that these]

... can be best attained by promoting organisation among the tenant-farmers; by defending those who may be threatened with eviction for refusing to pay unjust rents; by facilitating the working of the Bright clauses of the Irish Land Act during the winter; and by obtaining such reforms in the laws relating to land as will enable every tenant to become owner of his holding by paying a fair rent for a limited number of years.

Parnell, Davitt, John Dillon and others then went to the United States to raise funds for the League with spectacular results. Branches were also set up in Scotland, where the Crofters Party imitated the League and secured a reforming Act in 1886.

The government had introduced the first Land Act in 1870, which proved largely ineffective. It was followed by further marginally more effective Irish Land Acts of 1880 and 1881. These established a Land Commission that started to reduce some rents. Parnell together with all of his party lieutenants, including Father Eugene Sheehy known as &quot;the Land League priest&quot;, went into a bitter verbal offensive and were imprisoned in October 1881 under the Irish Coercion Act in Kilmainham Jail for &quot;sabotaging the Land Act&quot;, from where the &quot;No-Rent Manifesto&quot; was issued, calling for a national tenant farmer rent strike until &quot;constitutional liberties&quot; were restored and the prisoners freed. It had a modest success In Ireland, and mobilized financial and political support from the Irish Diaspora.

Although the League discouraged violence, agrarian crimes increased widely. Typically a rent strike would be followed by eviction by the police and the bailiffs. Tenants who continued to pay the rent would be subject to a boycott, or as it was contemporaneously described in the US press, an &quot;excommunication&quot; by local League members. Where cases went to court, witnesses would change their stories, resulting in an unworkable legal system. This in turn led on to stronger criminal laws being passed that were described by the League as &quot;Coercion Acts&quot;.

The bitterness that developed helped Parnell later in his Home Rule campaign. Davitt&#x27;s views as seen in his famous slogan: &quot;The land of Ireland for the people of Ireland&quot; was aimed at strengthening the hold on the land by the peasant Irish at the expense of the alien landowners. In reaction to such appeals, and to the Phoenix Park murders to which Parnell&#x27;s unionist opponents sought to associate him, what limited Protestant support that the League had enjoyed in the north fell away.

Parnell aimed to harness the emotive element, but he and his party were strictly constitutional. He envisioned tenant farmers as potential freeholders of the land they had rented.

==In the United States==
The Land League had an equivalent organization in the United States, which raised hundreds of thousands of dollars both for famine relief and also for political action. The Clan na Gael attempted to infiltrate the Land League, with limited success.

==Land war==

From 1879 to 1882, the &quot;Land War&quot; in pursuance of the &quot;Three Fs&quot; (Fair Rent, Fixity of Tenure and Free Sale) first demanded by the Tenant Right League in 1850, was fought in earnest. The League organised resistance to evictions, reductions in rents and aided the work of relief agencies. Landlords&#x27; attempts to evict tenants led to violence, but the Land League denounced excessive violence and destruction.

Withholding of rent led to evictions until &quot;Ashbourne&#x27;s Act&quot; in 1885 made it unprofitable for most landlords to evict. By then agricultural prices had made a recovery, and rents had been fixed and could be reviewed downwards, but tenants found that holding out communally was the best option. Critics noted that the poorer sub-tenants were still expected to pay their rents to tenant farmers.

The widespread upheavals and extensive evictions were accompanied by several years of bad weather and poor harvests when the tenant farmers who were unable to pay the full arrears of rents resorted to a rent strike. A renewed Land War was waged under the Plan of Campaign from 1886 up until 1892 during which the League decided on a fair rent and then encouraged its members to offer this rent to the landlords. If this was refused, then the rent would be paid by tenants to the League and the landlord would not receive any money until he accepted a discount.

The first target, ironically, was a member of the Catholic clergy, Canon Ulick Burke of Knock, who was eventually induced to reduce his rents by 25%. Many landlords resisted these tactics, often violently and there were deaths on either side of the dispute. The Royal Irish Constabulary, the national armed police force, were charged with upholding the law and protecting both landlord and tenant against violence. Originally, the movement cut across some sectarian boundaries, with some meetings held in Orange halls in Ulster, but the tenancy system in effect there Ulster Custom was quite different and fairer to tenants and support drifted away.

As a result of the Land War, the Irish National Land League was suppressed by the authorities. In October 1882, as its successor Parnell founded the Irish National League to campaign on broader issues including Home Rule. Many of the Scottish members formed the Scottish Land Restoration League. In 1881, the League started publishing &quot;United Ireland&quot;, a weekly newspaper edited by William O&#x27;Brien, which continued until 1898.

==Outcomes==
Within decades of the league&#x27;s foundation, through the efforts of William O&#x27;Brien and George Wyndham (a descendant of Lord Edward FitzGerald), the 1902 Land Conference produced the Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903 which allowed Irish tenant farmers to buy out their freeholds with UK government loans over 68 years through the Land Commission (an arrangement that has never been possible in Britain itself). For agricultural labourers, D.D. Sheehan and the Irish Land and Labour Association secured their demands from the Liberal government elected in 1905 to pass the &quot;Labourers (Ireland) Act 1906&quot;, and the , which paid County Councils to build over 40,000 new rural cottages, each on an acre of land. By 1914, 75% of occupiers were buying out their landlords, mostly under the two Acts. In all, under the pre-UK Land Acts over 316,000 tenants purchased their holdings amounting to out of a total of in the country. Sometimes the holdings were described as &quot;uneconomic&quot;, but the overall sense of social justice was manifest.

The major land reforms came when Parliament passed laws in 1870, 1881, 1903 and 1909 that enabled most tenant farmers to purchase their lands, and lowered the rents of the others. From 1870 and as a result of the Land War agitations and the Plan of Campaign of the 1880s, various British governments introduced a series of Irish Land Acts. William O&#x27;Brien played a leading role in the 1902 Land Conference to pave the way for the most advanced social legislation in Ireland since the Union, the Wyndham Land Purchase Act of 1903. This Act set the conditions for the break-up of large estates and gradually devolved to rural landholders and tenants&#x27; ownership of the lands. It effectively ended the era of the absentee landlord, finally resolving the Irish Land Question.

<text>Francesco Scavullo (January 16, 1921 – January 6, 2004) was an American fashion photographer best known for his work on the covers of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; for over three decades, and his celebrity portraits.

Some of Scavullo&#x27;s more controversial work included a &quot;Cosmospolitan&quot; centerfold of a nude Burt Reynolds and photographs of a young Brooke Shields that some considered overly sexual.

==Biography==
Scavullo was born January 16, 1921, on Staten Island, New York City. He also lived in Midtown Manhattan at E 52nd Street. He used his father&#x27;s camera to photograph his sisters, who would model for him. He began working for a studio that produced fashion catalogs and soon moved to &quot;Vogue.&quot; Scavullo spent three years as Horst P. Horst&#x27;s assistant, studying Horst&#x27;s techniques. He created a cover for &quot;Seventeen&quot; in 1948 that won him a contract with the magazine. Scavullo soon opened his own studio in Manhattan, and was married to model Carol McCallson from 1952 to 1955.
Scavullo&#x27;s 1969 photograph of singer Janis Joplin with a cigarette in her hand was exhibited at the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth, Texas. The museum poster refers to Joplin, who died in 1970, as having a &quot;free-spirited fervor of the counterculture revolution.&quot;

Scavullo befriended a young teenager from Philadelphia, future supermodel Gia Carangi, whose career he was largely responsible for launching. When Carangi&#x27;s heroin addiction made it impossible for her to find work later, Scavullo continued to employ and support her until her eventual death from complications of AIDS. Scavullo himself was diagnosed as manic-depressive in 1981.

Scavullo created shots for various movie posters, album covers and Broadway shows, including one for &quot;A Star is Born&quot; (featuring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson), Judy Collins&#x27; &quot;Hard Times for Lovers,&quot; a portrait of Julie Andrews for Blake Edwards&#x27; &quot;Victor Victoria&quot;, the cover and poster photos of KISS&#x27; 1979 album &quot;Dynasty&quot;, photos of Donna Summer for her &quot;Once Upon A Time&quot; and &quot;Live and More&quot; double albums and later &quot;&quot;. In 1981, Scavullo was commissioned by Mikhail Baryshnikov to photograph the dancers of the American Ballet Theatre, which formed the basis of an exhibition that was later shown in a nationwide tour. In addition, he photographed the underground Warhol super star Tally Brown for his book Francesco Scavullo 1948-1984.

Scavullo photographed Duran Duran in the 1980s, with his work featured on various releases including the cover of &quot;The Wild Boys&quot; single. He appeared in the band&#x27;s tour documentary &quot;Sing Blue Silver.&quot;

Scavullo&#x27;s work has been used on the covers of &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Interview&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone.&quot; He published several books, from &quot;Scavullo on Beauty&quot; (1976) to &quot;Scavullo Nudes&quot; (2000).

Scavullo died on January 6, 2004 (ten days before his 83rd birthday) of heart failure at the age of 82 while on his way to a New York photo shoot with a then up-and-coming CNN news anchor, Anderson Cooper. Scavullo was survived by his partner in life and art, Sean Byrnes.

<doc id="423014" wikidata="Q2021216" url="?curid=423014" title="List of titles and honours of Elizabeth II">
<text>Elizabeth II held numerous titles and honours, both during and before her time as monarch of each of her Commonwealth realms. Each is listed below; where two dates are shown, the first indicates the date of receiving the title or award (the title as Princess Elizabeth of York being given as from her birth), and the second indicates the date of its loss or renunciation.

==Royal titles and styles==

* 21 April 192611 December 1936: &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; Princess Elizabeth of York
* 11 December 193620 November 1947: &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; The Princess Elizabeth
* 20 November 19476 February 1952: &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; The Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh
* 6 February 19528 September 2022: &quot;Her Majesty&quot; The Queen

Upon Elizabeth&#x27;s accession to the throne, she was asked by her Private Secretary what her regnal name would be, to which she responded, &quot;My own, of coursewhat else?&quot; Until 1953, her official style was &quot;by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Queen, Defender of the Faith&quot;. She was proclaimed as queen using that title in Canada and South Africa, whereas, in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, she was proclaimed as &quot;Queen Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God Queen of this Realm and of Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith&quot;.

A decision was reached by Elizabeth&#x27;s prime ministers at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x27; Conference of 1952, whereby the Queen would accord herself different styles and titles in each of her realms, reflecting that in each state she acted as monarch of that particular country, regardless of her other roles. Canada&#x27;s preferred format was: &quot;Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, Queen of Canada and of Her other realms and territories, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith&quot;. However, as Australia wished to have the United Kingdom mentioned in all the Queen&#x27;s titles, the resolution reached was a designation that included the United Kingdom as well as, for the first time, separate reference to the other Commonwealth realms. Thereafter, separate but parallel royal styles and titles acts were passed in each of the Commonwealth realms, granting Elizabeth a distinct but similarly constituted title in each state, meaning that when Elizabeth was crowned in the same year, she held seven separate titles.

With further evolution of the Commonwealth since that time, Elizabeth held at the time of her death 15 different regnal titles, one for each of the current Commonwealth realms. In all realms other than Canada and Grenada, the reference to the United Kingdom has been removed; Australia doing so in 1973, in contrast to the Australian government&#x27;s position 20 years earlier. Traditionally, the Queen&#x27;s titles are listed in the order in which the realms other than the United Kingdom (the original realm) first became Dominions—namely, Canada (1867), Australia (1901), and New Zealand (1907)—followed by the rest in the order in which the former colony became an independent realm: Jamaica (1962), The Bahamas (1973), Grenada (1974), Papua New Guinea (1975), the Solomon Islands (1978), Tuvalu (1978), Saint Lucia (1979), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (1979), Belize (1981), Antigua and Barbuda (1981) and Saint Kitts and Nevis (1983).

Owing to her status, Elizabeth II was usually just known as &quot;The Queen&quot; across the world.

The Queen&#x27;s British styles and titles were read out at her funeral by David White, Garter Principal King of Arms, as follows: 

The Queen&#x27;s New Zealand styles and titles were read out at the State Memorial Service at the Wellington Cathedral on 26 September by Phillip O&#x27;Shea, New Zealand Herald of Arms Extraordinary, as follows:
===Dispute in Scotland===

Though the situation was the same in every one of the Queen&#x27;s realms beyond the United Kingdom, only within Scotland did the title &quot;Elizabeth II&quot; cause controversy as there had never been an &quot;Elizabeth I&quot; in Scotland. In an act of sabotage, new Royal Mail post boxes in Scotland, bearing the royal cypher &quot;ER&quot;, were vandalised, after which, to avoid further problems, post boxes and Royal Mail vehicles in Scotland bore only the Crown of Scotland. A legal case, &quot;MacCormick v. Lord Advocate&quot; (1953 SC 396), was taken to contest the right of the Queen to title herself &quot;Elizabeth II&quot; within Scotland, arguing that to do so would be a breach of the Act of Union. The case, however, was lost on the grounds that the pursuers had not title to sue the Crown and the numbering of monarchs was part of the royal prerogative, and thus not governed by the Act of Union. Winston Churchill suggested that future British monarchs should be numbered according to either their English or Scottish predecessors, whichever number is higher.

At the opening ceremony of the devolved Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh in 1999, attended by the Queen, the Presiding Officer Lord Steel said at the close of his opening address: &quot;It is good that today, once again, we the elected representatives of the people are able to welcome your majesty, not only as Queen of the United Kingdom, but seated as you are among us, to greet you in the historic and constitutionally correct manner, with warmth and affection, as Queen of Scots.&quot; In 2002 Winnie Ewing, then president of the Scottish National Party, wrote to the Queen asking her to adopt the title &quot;Elizabeth I&quot; in Scotland.

Other realms adopted the style &quot;Queen Elizabeth II&quot; despite never having been ruled by Queen Elizabeth I of England.

<text>Herbert John Streicher (August 27, 1947 – March 19, 2013), better known by his professional pseudonym Harry Reems, was an American pornographic actor, later working as a real estate agent. His most famous roles were as Doctor Young in the 1972 pornographic cult classic &quot;Deep Throat&quot; and The Teacher in the 1973 classic &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot;. Throughout the 1970s and into the mid-1980s, he was one of the most prolific performers in the adult film industry. He became the first American actor to be prosecuted solely for appearing in a film. He retired from the industry in 1985.

==Early life==
Reems was born Herbert John Streicher on August 27, 1947, into a Jewish family. He was the youngest of three children. His father Don Streicher worked as a salesman before becoming a bookmaker. His mother, Rose, was a model. Harry&#x27;s father later entered the printing industry and was wealthy enough to move the family to Westchester, New York. In 1965, at age 18, Harry went the University of Pittsburgh to become a dentist. He later enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, from which he received an honorable discharge following hardship leave. In 1967 he moved to the East Village in Manhattan where his brother and roommate were gaining experience as actors. His early non-pornographic acting career was principally in off-Broadway theater for La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, New York Theater Ensemble and National Shakespeare Company.

==Career==
Prior to appearing in &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, Streicher was chosen by filmmaker Eduardo Cemano to perform a hardcore scene in a film called &quot;The Deviates&quot;, which had been released previously as a softcore film. It was a body-painting sex scene that Streicher later described as his most painful sex experience because the tempera paint used began to dry and crack. Cemano then featured him in his first 16 mm feature film, called &quot;The Weirdos and the Oddballs&quot;, which was later upgraded to 35 mm and released as &quot;Zora Knows Best&quot;. It was for this film that he changed his name to Peter Long.

Looking for ways to support himself, Streicher appeared in dozens of short silent stag films, often referred to as &quot;loops&quot;, during the early 1970s. He eventually went on to appear in approximately 140 feature-length sexploitation and hardcore films between 1971 and 1974 and from 1982 to 1985, with &quot;Deep Throat&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot; (1973) being the best known, as well as violent exploitation films like &quot;Forced Entry&quot; (1973) and &quot;Sex Wish&quot; (1976); in the former he plays a sadistic Vietnam veteran hellbent on rape and murder – later described by Streicher as the one film he regretted appearing in – while in the latter he plays a husband-turned-vigilante seeking revenge over the rape and murder of his wife.

In 1975 he published a memoir, &quot;Here Comes Harry Reems,&quot; in which he details the early years of his adult film career. Reems also appeared in a couple of mainstream films, such as the sex comedy/horror film &quot;Case of the Full Moon Murders&quot; (1973), the drama &quot;Deadly Weapons&quot; (1974), horror films &quot;Demented&quot; (1980) and &quot;To All a Goodnight&quot; (1980), the comedy &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Movie Madness&quot; (1982) and the TV movie &quot;The Cartier Affair&quot; (1984). He provided narration for the film &quot;Mae West&quot; (1982). He also appeared in several Swedish-produced porn films, including &quot;Justine &amp; Juliette&quot; (1975), &quot;Bel Ami&quot; (1976) and &quot;Molly&quot; (1977), as well as the mainstream &quot;SS Operation Wolf Cub&quot; (1983).

For the production of &quot;Deep Throat&quot; in Miami, Florida in January 1972, Streicher was hired to be part of the lighting crew, although the director was unable to cast one of the roles and asked him to play the part. He was paid $250 for one day of acting work ($1,200 total). Streicher said that he was unaware that the director had given him the name &quot;Harry Reems&quot; until he saw the movie.

==Trial and later years as an actor==
Reems&#x27; appearance in &quot;Deep Throat&quot; led to his arrest by FBI agents in New York City in July 1974 and his indictment in Memphis, Tennessee, in June 1975 on federal charges of conspiracy to distribute obscenity across state lines. Reems called it forum shopping. He was convicted in April 1976 with 11 other individuals and four corporations.

Reems&#x27; conviction was overturned on appeal in April 1977, as his activities in making the film took place before a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on obscenity in 1973 (&quot;Miller v. California&quot;), and Reems was granted a new trial. The charges against Reems were dropped in August. The defense argued he was the first American actor to ever be prosecuted by the federal government merely for appearing in a film, and he received considerable support from established Hollywood and New York celebrities during his trial, including Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty, Shirley MacLaine, Richard Dreyfuss, Colleen Dewhurst, Rod McKuen, Ben Gazzara, Mike Nichols, Julie Newmar, Dick Cavett, George Plimpton, and Stephen Sondheim. Nicholson, Beatty, and Louise Fletcher were reportedly ready to testify on his behalf at his trial. Reems&#x27; successful appeal was handled by Alan Dershowitz. His autobiography &quot;Here Comes Harry Reems&quot; was published in 1975.

Reems was cast in the 1978 musical film &quot;Grease&quot; as Coach Calhoun, but, out of fear that his notoriety would jeopardize the film&#x27;s box office in the Southern United States, he was replaced by Sid Caesar.

Reems returned to the stage in the plays &quot;The Office Murders&quot; (1979) and &quot;What the Butler Saw&quot; (1981).

In 1982, after an eight-year hiatus from porn, Reems returned to the industry and performed in the film &quot;Society Affairs&quot;, and reportedly received a six-figure salary. In 1984, he starred in &quot;Those Young Girls&quot; with the notoriously then 16 year old Traci Lords (who had lied about her age). Reems retired from performing in porn in 1985. In the same year, he was included in the XRCO Hall of Fame; also included in the AVN Hall of Fame

==Later years==

After years of drug abuse and homelessness, Reems began his recovery in 1989 while living in Park City, Utah. He was married to Jeanne Sterret, a religious woman he had met while skiing in the same city. He then converted from Judaism to Christianity. &quot;Being the low-bottom drunk that I was, I started going around to churches,&quot; said Reems. &quot;I called myself a church gypsy.&quot; Reems credited his conversion to Reverend Mark Heiss, a former pastor with Park City Community Church in Park City, Utah.

Heiss was abruptly replaced at the church by someone else, for reasons Reems says were never explained; Reems left the congregation because he believed church attendance was &quot;about putting money in the coffers.&quot; Outside organized religion, he continued to meditate, pray, and offer gratitude to God. &quot;If I didn&#x27;t put God in my life, I&#x27;d be dead now,&quot; he said. &quot;I am not religious. I&#x27;m spiritual, 100 percent.&quot; He continued to identify himself as &quot;Harry Reems&quot;, even using the name while he worked as a real estate agent. He later was a trustee at a local United Methodist church.

He was interviewed in the 2005 documentary &quot;Inside Deep Throat&quot;. Reems&#x27;s entrance into the adult entertainment industry, his experience filming &quot;Deep Throat&quot; and its subsequent infamy and obscenity trials, are the subject of the 2010 play &quot;The Deep Throat Sex Scandal&quot;. During the Los Angeles run of the play, Reems died in Utah; his death was noted by the production.

In 2014, award-winning playwright Craig Hepworth opened his play &quot;Porno Chic&quot; about Reems and Lovelace and the fallout from &quot;Deep Throat&quot; in Manchester, UK. The play opened to rave reviews, and the 2016 production went on to win Best Drama at the GMF Awards. The play is set to return in 2018/19 for a UK tour.

==Death==
Reems died of pancreatic cancer on March 19, 2013, aged 65, at the Salt Lake City Veterans Administration Medical Center. He had no children.

<doc id="423019" wikidata="Q958125" url="?curid=423019" title="Love Letter (1995 film)">
<text>Love Letter is a 1995 Japanese romantic film written, directed and edited by Shunji Iwai in his debut feature film and starring Miho Nakayama. The majority of the film was shot on the island of Hokkaidō, primarily in Otaru. It achieved great success at the box office in Japan and gained popularity in other East Asian countries, particularly South Korea. Remarkably, it was one of the first Japanese films to be shown in South Korean cinemas since World War II, garnering 645,615 admissions and ranking as the tenth highest-grossing general release of the year.

Shunji Iwai collaborated with cinematographer Noboru Shinoda, resulting in a film celebrated for its evocative winter cinematography. Pop singer Miho Nakayama was cast in the dual roles of Hiroko Watanabe and Itsuki Fujii, while teenager Miki Sakai made her movie debut and won the &#x27;Newcomer of the Year&#x27; Award at the Japanese Academy Awards for her portrayal of a young Itsuki Fujii. Etsushi Toyokawa and Takashi Kashiwabara played the main male roles as Akiba Shigeru and the male Itsuki Fujii, respectively.

The American distribution rights for the film were acquired by Fine Line Features, which released it in theaters under the new title When I Close My Eyes.

==Plot==

Hiroko Watanabe, living in Kobe, loses her fiancé, Itsuki Fujii, in a mountain climbing accident. Two years later, on the day of Itsuki&#x27;s memorial ceremony, Hiroko looks through his high school yearbook and finds an address under his name. She writes a letter to him and receives a reply from a woman named Itsuki Fujii, who bears a striking resemblance to Hiroko. The movie alternates between Hiroko and Female Itsuki as they exchange letters.

Female Itsuki, who works at the public library, is suffering from a persistent cold but refuses to seek medical help. It is revealed that her father died of pneumonia when she was in high school. Hiroko visits her friend Akiba and shows him the letter, believing it to be a message from heaven. Akiba confesses his feelings for Hiroko and encourages her to let go of Itsuki. Hiroko continues writing to Itsuki, unaware that the reply she receives is actually from Akiba, who sent the letter asking for proof of Itsuki&#x27;s identity.

To uncover the truth and help Hiroko move on, Akiba and Hiroko plan a visit to Otaru, Female Itsuki&#x27;s hometown. However, Female Itsuki is tricked into going to the hospital, where she falls asleep and has a dream about her father&#x27;s death. Meanwhile, Hiroko and Akiba wait outside Female Itsuki&#x27;s home but decide to leave a letter for her instead of meeting her in person. They later spot each other briefly before parting ways.

Back home, Hiroko realizes that there were two Itsuki Fujiis in the yearbook and wonders if her physical resemblance to Female Itsuki is the reason why her fiancé fell in love with her. She asks Female Itsuki to confirm this theory and to share her high school memories of Itsuki.

Flashbacks reveal that Male Itsuki was a shy and peculiar boy who shared a name with Female Itsuki. They were often paired together as a couple by their classmates. Female Itsuki failed as a go-between for Sanae, a girl who has a crush on Itsuki. During her mourning period for her father, Female Itsuki is visited by Male Itsuki, who asks her to return a book for him. After her return to school, she discovers that Male Itsuki has transferred, and the book exchange was the last time she saw him.

Female Itsuki visits her old school and learns that Male Itsuki died in the mountain accident two years ago. Hiroko and Akiba visit the mountain where Itsuki died, sharing their memories of him. Meanwhile, Female Itsuki collapses from a fever, and her neglected cold has turned into pneumonia, mirroring her father&#x27;s fate. Her mother and grandfather brave a snowstorm to get her to the hospital just in time.

In the mountains, Akiba wakes Hiroko to watch the sunrise and points to a peak, symbolically greeting Itsuki. Hiroko cries out to Itsuki, mimicking their first letters. Meanwhile, Female Itsuki wakes up in the hospital.

Some time later, Hiroko and Itsuki continue their correspondence. Itsuki receives a visit from volunteer girls from her former high school library, who show her a book Male Itsuki had given her for return. They discover his name on the checkout card and, on the back, find a sketch he made of Female Itsuki. Instead of writing about the drawing, Female Itsuki decides not to send the letter.

<text>The  (, &quot;Ancestral Heritage&quot;) was a pseudoscientific organization founded by the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; in Nazi Germany in 1935. Established by &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler in July 1, 1935 as an SS appendage devoted to promoting racial theories espoused by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, the &quot;Ahnenerbe&quot; consisted of academics and scientists from a broad range of academic disciplines who fostered the idea that Germans descended from an Aryan race which was racially superior to other racial groups.

Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, and transformed the country into a one-party state governed as a dictatorship. He claimed that Germans were descended from an Aryan race which, in contrast to established academic understandings, had invented most major developments in human history, such as agriculture, art, and writing. Most of the world&#x27;s scholars did not accept this, and the Nazis established the &quot;Ahnenerbe&quot; in order to provide evidence for their racial theories and to promote them to the German public. &quot;Ahnenerbe&quot; scholars interpreted evidence to fit Hitler&#x27;s beliefs, and many consciously fabricated evidence to do so. The organisation sent expeditions to various parts of the world to find evidence to support their theories.

The government of Nazi Germany used the organization&#x27;s research to justify many of their policies, including the Holocaust. Nazi propaganda also cited &quot;Ahnenerbe&quot; claims that archaeological evidence indicated that the Aryan race had historically resided in eastern Europe to justify German expansion there. In 1937, the &quot;Ahnenerbe&quot; became an official branch of the SS and was renamed the Research and Teaching Community in Ancestral Heritage (). Much of their research was placed on hold after the outbreak of World War II in 1939, though they continued to carry out new research in areas under German occupation after Operation Barbarossa began in 1941.

During the end of World War II in Europe in 1945, &quot;Ahnenerbe&quot; members destroyed much of the organization&#x27;s paperwork to avoid being incriminated in forthcoming war crimes trials. Numerous members escaped Allied denazification policies and remained active in West Germany&#x27;s archaeological establishment in the postwar era, which stifled scholarly research into the &quot;Ahnenerbe&quot; until German reunification in 1990. Ideas promoted by the organization have retained an appeal for some neo-Nazi and far-right circles and have also influenced later pseudoarchaeologists.

== Background ==
Adolf Hitler believed that one could divide humanity into three groups: &quot;the founders of culture, the bearers of culture, the destroyers of culture&quot;. The founders of culture, in Hitler&#x27;s view, were a biologically distinct Aryan race who (he believed) had been tall, blond, and originating in Northern Europe. He believed that in prehistory, the Aryan race had been responsible for all significant developments in human culture, including agriculture, architecture, music, literature, and the visual arts. He believed that most modern Germans were the descendants of these Aryans and had genetically inherited the Aryans&#x27; biological superiority to other races. The destroyers of culture, in Hitler&#x27;s view, were the Jews, whom he regarded not as a genetically diverse population sharing certain ethno-cultural and religious traits—as they were then widely recognized—but as a unified, biologically distinct race. He believed that wherever Jews went, they damaged and ultimately destroyed the cultures surrounding them.

Hitler had promoted his ideas about the greatness of Germany&#x27;s ancestors in his 1925 book, . Outside Germany, most scholars and scientists regarded Hitler&#x27;s ideas about human evolution and prehistory as nonsense, in part due to the absence of any evidence that North European communities had ever originated major developments in prehistory, such as the development of agriculture and writing, all of which first appeared in the Near East and in Asia.

In January 1929 Hitler appointed Nazi Party member Heinrich Himmler to head the (SS), a paramilitary group founded in 1925 to serve as personal bodyguards to Hitler and other Nazis. Himmler set out to re-organise the SS, introducing a better system of organisation, and gathering intelligence on prominent Jews and Freemasons, as well as on rival political groups. In 1929, Himmler launched an SS recruitment campaign, and by the end of 1931 the group had 10,000 members. Himmler aimed to ensure that this membership was as racially Nordic as possible, establishing the SS Race and Settlement Main Office (RuSHA) to screen both applicants and the women whom SS members proposed to marry. In believing in the existence of a &quot;Nordic&quot; racial type which was the purest survival of the ancient Aryans, Himmler was influenced by the Nordicist ideas of Hans F. K. Günther (1891–1968), which had been popular in German nationalist circles over the preceding decades.

Himmler had an abiding interest in the past, and in how it could provide a blueprint for the future. However, his views of the ancient Germanic peoples differed from Hitler&#x27;s in certain areas. Hitler was perplexed as to why ancient societies in southern Europe had developed more advanced technology and architecture than their contemporaries in northern Europe. Hitler stated that &quot;People make a tremendous fuss about the excavations carried out in districts inhabited by our forebears of the pre-Christian era. I am afraid that I cannot share their enthusiasm, for I cannot help remembering that, while our ancestors were making these vessels out of stone and clay, over which our archaeologists rave, the Greeks had already built the Acropolis.&quot; Hitler explained this by claiming that the Aryans must also have inhabited the south of the continent and that they were responsible for establishing the societies of ancient Greece and Rome. Specifically, he believed that it was the warmer climates of the south that enabled these Aryans to develop in ways that those living further north, in colder and wetter climates, did not. Himmler was aware of these views but, unlike Hitler, admired what he believed was the fierceness and valour of the Germanic tribes of northern Europe. He was particularly interested in Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Germania&quot;, an ethnographic and historical account of the Iron-Age Germanic tribes written by the Roman historian at the end of the first century CE.

=== Nazi Party takes power ===
In the 1932 federal election, the Nazis secured 230 seats in the Reichstag, making them the largest single party but without a controlling majority. Six months later, President Paul von Hindenburg invited Hitler to become Chancellor, after which the latter cemented Nazi dominance over the government. In February 1933, Hitler convinced von Hindenburg to issue the Reichstag Fire Decree, legally suspending civil liberties. Himmler, who was newly appointed as the police chief of Munich, ordered the arrests of those he regarded as a threat to the Nazis—including journalists, labour organisers, Jewish community leaders, socialists, and communists—and their incarceration in Dachau concentration camp. Hitler approved of Himmler&#x27;s tactics and appointed him head of the political police across Germany.

In 1933, Himmler initiated plans to establish a &quot;Nordic Academy&quot; to assist the instruction of the SS upper ranks. He was assisted in this by Karl Maria Wiligut, an occultist who was popular in German ultra-nationalist circles. Himmler brought Wiligut into the SS—where he eventually rose to the rank of Brigadeführer—and gave him a private villa in Berlin. Using Wiligut&#x27;s prophecies as his guide, Himmler selected Wewelsburg castle in Westphalia to serve as a base for many SS operations. The architect Hermann Bartels was employed to oversee renovations to the castle to make it fit for the SS&#x27;s use. As part of these alterations, one of the rooms in the building became known as &quot;the Grail Room&quot; with a rock crystal representing the Holy Grail being placed in a central position. Himmler also established a private museum at the castle, employing the young archaeologist Wilhelm Jordan to manage it.

In 1934, Himmler met the Dutch prehistorian Herman Wirth, who was then living in Germany, at the home of Johann von Leers, a Nazi propagandist. Wirth was one of the most controversial prehistorians in Germany. After examining symbols found in rural Frisian folk art, he became convinced that they represented the survival of an ancient script used by a prehistoric Nordic civilisation. This script, Wirth believed, was the world&#x27;s oldest written language and had been the basis for all other ancient scripts. Wirth also believed that if he could decipher it, he could then learn the nature of the ancient religion of the Aryan race. This belief conflicted with established scholarly understandings of the past; by the 1930s, scholars were aware that the world&#x27;s two oldest scripts were those of Mesopotamia and Egypt, and that northern Europe only developed its own form of literacy, that of the runes, under the influence of Etruscan script between 400 BCE to 50 CE. Attempting to explain the lack of any archaeological or historical evidence for an ancient advanced Nordic civilisation, Wirth claimed that the Aryans had evolved in an Arctic homeland two million years ago, before establishing their advanced society on a land in the North Atlantic, which had since sunken into the sea, giving rise to the stories about Atlantis.

Wirth&#x27;s ideas were rejected and ridiculed by the German archaeological establishment, although they had gained the support of several wealthy backers, which assisted him in promoting them. Himmler was among those who liked Wirth&#x27;s ideas. Himmler was interested in the pre-Christian religions of northern Europe, believing that a modern Pagan religion modelled on them could replace Christianity as the primary religion of the German people. Himmler disliked Christianity because of its Semitic origins, its presentation of Jesus of Nazareth as a Jew, and its advocacy of charity and compassion. Later, Himmler privately told his personal physician that after the Second World War, &quot;the old Germanic gods will be restored&quot;.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
On July 1, 1935, Himmler organised a meeting at the Berlin headquarters of the SS where he discussed his desire to launch a prehistoric research institute. Both Wirth and the agriculturalist Richard Walther Darré were present, and both responded with enthusiasm to the idea. The group was launched as a department of RuSHA. Wirth became the group&#x27;s president, while Himmler took the role of superintendent, a position entailing considerable control by placing him in charge of its board of trustees. Its formal goal was &quot;to promote the science of ancient intellectual history&quot;.

The organisation was initially named the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Society for the Study of the History of Primeval Ideas&quot;), but this was soon shortened to Ahnenerbe. This was a German term for &quot;something inherited from the forefathers&quot;. The Ahnenerbe&#x27;s first premises were at number 29 and 30 of the Brüderstrasse, a thirteenth-century street in Berlin. These corner buildings were rented from the city&#x27;s department store magnate Rudolf Herdzog. Initially, it employed seven members of staff. Reflecting Wirth&#x27;s fixation on the idea of an ancient Aryan script, the organisation&#x27;s early focus was upon what Wirth called &quot;script and symbol studies&quot;. One of its researchers, Yrjö von Grönhagen, was for instance tasked with collecting the Finnish wooden calendars which were engraved with various symbols.

Starting in 1934, Himmler began financially supporting and visiting excavations in Germany. This brought him into contact with archaeologists like , Hans Schleif, and Wilhelm Unverzagt, director of the in Berlin. Initially, there were two departments within the SS engaged in archaeology: the of the and the at the RuSHA. The latter (&quot;RA IIIB&quot;) was established in 1934 and was supposed to serve as a &quot;general staff&quot; for all SS activities related to prehistory. It was responsible for archaeological research and related propaganda and led by Rolf Höhne, a geologist. Höhne was eventually replaced by Peter Paulsen, an archaeologist, in October 1937. The department did not conduct any excavations itself, but was intended to extend the influence of the SS over other institutions, especially those responsible for education/research and monument preservation. In fact, Langsdorff did this in Himmler&#x27;s personal staff. The department also tried to make use of pre-history in the training and indoctrination of SS members. When the RuSHA was restructured, the department was dissolved with its responsibilities passing to the . The in Himmler&#x27;s personal staff was established in 1935 on the initiative of Langsdorff. In March 1937, Höhne joined the leadership of this department. By 1937, it was responsible for SS excavations and maintained its own personnel for this activity.

The organization&#x27;s official mission was twofold. Its first purpose was to reveal new evidence for the accomplishments of the ancestors of the modern Germans &quot;using exact scientific methods&quot;. Its second purpose was to convey its findings to the German public through magazine articles, books, museum exhibits, and scholarly conferences.
According to Pringle, it was however &quot;in the business of myth-making&quot;, repeatedly &quot;distorting the truth and churning out carefully tailored evidence to support the racial ideas of Adolf Hitler.&quot; Some members of the Ahnenerbe consciously altered their evidence and interpretations to match Hitler&#x27;s beliefs; others appear to have been unaware of how their adherence to Nazi doctrine was shaping their interpretations.

Himmler regarded the Ahnenerbe as an elite think tank which would sweep away previous scholarship on the development of humanity and reveal that Hitler&#x27;s ideas on the subject were true. Himmler also believed that the group&#x27;s investigations might reveal ancient secrets about agriculture, medicine, and warfare which would benefit Nazi Germany. It employed scholars from a wide range of academic fields, including archaeology, anthropology, ethnology, folkloristics, runology, Classics, history, musicology, philology, biology, zoology, botany, astronomy, and medicine. Himmler believed that scholars active in all of these different fields would piece together a view of the past that would revolutionise established interpretations; in his words, it would represent &quot;hundreds of thousands of little mosaic stones, which portray the true picture of the origins of the world.&quot;

On July 1, 1935, at SS headquarters in Berlin, Himmler met with five &quot;racial experts&quot; representing Darré and with Wirth. Together they established an organization called the &quot;German Ancestral Heritage—Society for the Study of the History of Primeval Ideas&quot; (), shortened to its better-known form in 1937. At the meeting they designated its official goal, “to promote the science of ancient intellectual history,” and appointed Himmler as its superintendent, with Wirth serving as its president. Himmler appointed Wolfram Sievers (General Secretary) of the Ahnenerbe.

Through 1937, the Ahnenerbe was essentially engaged in amateur research. Financial and academic pressure caused Himmler to start looking for an alternative to Wirth as early as the spring of 1936. In September, Hitler negatively referred to Wirth&#x27;s beliefs regarding Atlantis and their influence on &quot;Böttcherstrasse architecture&quot; in a speech at the .

In March 1937, the Ahnenerbe was given a new statute, implementing the (leader principle) and giving Himmler extensive powers. Wirth was deposed as president and appointed honorary president, a powerless position. Himmler&#x27;s position as was given more power.

Walther Wüst was appointed the new president of the Ahnenerbe. Wüst was an expert on India and a dean at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, working on the side as a for the (SD, Security Service). Referred to as &quot;The Orientalist&quot; by Wolfram Sievers, Wüst had been recruited by him in May 1936 because of his ability to simplify science for the common man. After being appointed president, Wüst began improving the Ahnenerbe, moving the offices to a new headquarters that cost in the Dahlem neighborhood of Berlin. He also worked to limit the influence of “those he deemed scholarly upstarts,” which included cutting communication with the RuSHA office of Karl Maria Wiligut.

The led by Sievers was turned into the institution&#x27;s . The Ahnenerbe was renamed . It was moved from the RuSHA to Himmlers&#x27;s personal staff.

Wirth and Wilhelm Teudt lost their departments in Ahnenerbe in 1938. In 1939, the statutes were changed again and Wirth was deposed as honorary president. Himmler&#x27;s and Wüsts&#x27; titles were switched with Himmler now the president. Next to Wüst, the academic with most influence in the institution after 1939 was Herbert Jankuhn, who in 1937 still had categorically rejected cooperation with the &quot;unscientific&quot; Ahnenerbe.

Ahnenerbe was a mix between an SS department and an . Membership was open to all natural and legal persons. Its staff were SS members, many also working in other SS positions, and thus subject to SS jurisdiction.

In late 1936, Ahnenerbe took over the publication of Teudt&#x27;s magazine , first in cooperation with Teudt, then without him. The monthly now became the official voice of Ahnenerbe and was aimed at a wider audience. From December 1936, the magazine was distributed free of charge to all SS leaders.

Cooperation with other SS departments was initially limited, but improved after 1937. Contacts with the SD-HA and the editorial team of the SS weekly intensified. Ahnenerbe eventually had the scientific responsibility for the and in conjunction with the SS-HA, Ahnenerbe established and .

In 1939, the Ahnenerbe held its first independent annual convention, at Kiel. The event&#x27;s success contributed to the trend that archaeologists were increasingly turning to the Ahnenerbe and away from Alfred Rosenberg&#x27;s rival .

In fiscal year 1938–1939, the budget for the excavations department was , about 12% of the Ahnenerbe&#x27;s total budget. More than a third of that went to the Haithabu activities. Under Jankuhn&#x27;s direction four more archaeological departments were set up: in April 1938 the (a laboratory for analyzing pollen) was established at Dahlem under the leadership of . The at Wilhelmshaven led by , the led by Martin Rudolph and the directed by followed in 1939.

As a gift for Hitler&#x27;s fiftieth birthday, among the presents which Himmler procured for him was a set of leather bound books, one of which was on the subject of the Ahnenerbe&#x27;s research.

The Ahnenerbe sought to cultivate an air of professional integrity. The Ahnenerbe became an integral part of the SS.
By 1939, the Ahnenerbe employed 137 scholars and scientists, as well as 82 support workers, including artists, photographers, laboratory technicians, librarians, accountants, and secretaries.

=== The Holocaust ===
Himmler used the Ahnenerbe&#x27;s research to fuel and justify the Holocaust. In a 1937 speech at Bad Tölz, Himmler announced that the bog bodies of northwestern Europe, which testified to an Iron Age tradition in which individuals were deliberately killed and deposited in bogs, must have represented the eradication of homosexuals. This was an idea that he had adopted from Ahnenerbe archaeologist Herbert Jankuhn. His adoption of this suggestion was linked to his homophobic fear that male homosexuality was transmittable and that it could spread within the ranks of the SS and other spaces of male bonding unless strong measures were implemented to prevent it. Himmler then claimed this alleged ancient tradition as legitimation for the extermination of homosexuals within his own society. As many as 15,000 gay men were rounded up and imprisoned in concentration camps, where up to 60 percent died.

=== Second World War ===
Amid the German invasion of Poland in 1939, the Ahnenerbe sent a team into Warsaw to remove any items from its museums which they believed to be German in origin. In 1939, the Ahnenerbe&#x27;s further four planned expeditions—to Iran, the Canary Islands, the Andes, and Iceland—were indefinitely postponed. At the end of the war in Europe, members of the Ahnenerbe destroyed much of the organisation&#x27;s paperwork lest it incriminate them during future war crime tribunals.

=== Institutes ===

The Ahnenerbe had several different institutes or sections for its departments of research. Most of these were archeological but others included the Pflegestätte für Wetterkunde (Meteorology Section) headed by Obersturmführer Dr Hans Robert Scultetus, founded on the basis that Hanns Hörbiger&#x27;s could be used to provide accurate long-range weather forecasts, and a section devoted to musicology, whose aim was to determine &quot;the essence&quot; of German music. It recorded folk music on expeditions to Finland and the Faroe Islands, from ethnic Germans of the occupied territories, and in South Tyrol. The section made sound recordings, transcribed manuscripts and songbooks, and photographed and filmed instrument use and folk dances. The lur, a Bronze Age musical instrument, became central to this research, which concluded that Germanic consonance was in direct conflict to Jewish atonalism.

== Expeditions ==
=== Iceland ===
The country of Iceland was of particular interest to Hitler and Himmler due to their belief that the country was the Thule area which served as the birthplace of the Aryan race. In 1938, Himmler would send an archeological team to Iceland in hopes of finding an ancient place of worship for Nordic gods like Thor and Odin. A total of three Nazi-led trips would occur to Iceland in 1938. However, the three Ahnenerbe expeditions were limited due to restrictions enacted by the Iceland government. Despite finding a cave which the Ahnenerbe-led expedition team claimed was the location of the mystic place of worship, known as the hof, it would be proven that the site was in fact uninhabited before the 18th century.

=== Karelia ===
In 1935, Himmler contacted a Finnish nobleman and author, Yrjö von Grönhagen, after seeing one of his articles about the Kalevala folklore in a Frankfurt newspaper. Grönhagen agreed to lead an expedition through the Karelia region of Finland to record pagan sorcerers and witches. Because there was uncertainty about whether the Karelians would allow photography, the Finnish illustrator Ola Forsell also accompanied the team. Musicologist brought along a magnetophon, hoping to record pagan chants.

The team departed on their expedition in June 1936. Their first success was with a traditional singer, , who knew a song closely resembling one in the Kalevala although he was unaware of the book. Later, in Tolvajärvi, the team photographed and recorded Hannes Vornanen playing a traditional Finnish kantele.

One of the team&#x27;s final successes was in finding Miron-Aku, a soothsayer believed to be a witch by locals. Upon meeting the group, she claimed to have foreseen their arrival. The team persuaded her to perform a ritual for the camera and tape recorder in which she summoned the spirits of ancestors and &quot;divine[d] future events.&quot; The team also recorded information on Finnish saunas.

===Bohuslän===
After a slide show on February 19, 1936 of his trip to Bohuslän, a region in southwestern Sweden, Wirth convinced Himmler to launch an expedition to the region, the first official expedition financed by the Ahnenerbe. Bohuslän was known for its massive quantity of petroglyph rock carvings, which Wirth believed were evidence of an ancient writing system predating all known systems. Himmler appointed Wolfram Sievers to be the managing director of the expedition, likely because of Wirth&#x27;s earlier troubles balancing finances.

On August 4, 1936, the expedition set off on a three-month trip, starting at the German island of Rügen, then continuing to Backa, the first recorded rock-art site in Sweden. Despite the existence of scenes showing warriors, animals and ships, Wirth focused on the lines and circles that he thought made up a prehistoric alphabet. While his studies were largely based on personal belief, rather than objective scientific research, Wirth made interpretations of the meanings of ideograms carved in the rock, such as a circle bisected by a vertical line representing a year and a man standing with raised arms representing what Wirth called &quot;the Son of God.&quot; His team proceeded to make casts of what Wirth deemed the most important carvings and then carried the casts to camp, where they were crated and sent back to Germany. Once satisfied with their work at the site, the team set out on a trek through Sweden, eventually reaching the Norwegian island of Lauvøylandet.

=== Italy ===
In 1937, the Ahnenerbe sent the archaeologist Franz Altheim and his wife, the photographer Erika Trautmann, to Val Camonica, to study prehistoric rock inscriptions. The two returned to Germany claiming that they had found traces of Nordic runes on the rocks, supposedly confirming that ancient Rome was founded by Nordic incomers.
Also, an expedition to Sardinia was planned in the 1930s, but the reasons for it still remain unknown.

=== Central Eurasia ===
In 1938, Franz Altheim and his research partner Erika Trautmann requested the Ahnenerbe sponsor their expedition from Central Europe through Western Asia to study an internal power struggle of the Roman Empire, which they believed was fought between the Nordic and Semitic peoples. Eager to credit the vast success of the Roman Empire to people of a Nordic background, the Ahnenerbe agreed to match the put forward by Hermann Göring, an old friend of Trautmann&#x27;s.

In August 1938, after spending a few days traveling through remote hills searching for ruins of Dacian kingdoms, the two researchers arrived at their first major stop in Bucharest, the capital of Romania. There Grigore Florescu, the director of the Municipal Museum, met with them, and discussed both history and the politics of the day, including the activities of the Iron Guard.

After traveling through Istanbul, Athens, and Lebanon, the researchers went to Damascus. They were not welcomed by the French, who ruled Syria as a colony at the time. The newly-sovereign Kingdom of Iraq was being courted for an alliance with Germany, and Fritz Grobba, the German envoy to Baghdad, arranged for Altheim and Trautmann to meet with local researchers and be driven to Parthian and Persian ruins in southern Iraq, as well as Babylon.

Through Baghdad, the team went north to Assur where they met Sheikh Adjil el Yawar, a leader of the Shammar Bedouin tribe and commander of the northern Camel Corps. He discussed German politics and his desire to duplicate the success of Abd al-Aziz ibn Saud who had recently ascended to power in Saudi Arabia. With his support, the team traveled to their final major stop, the ruins of Hatra on the former border between the Roman and Persian empires.

=== New Swabia ===

The third German Antarctic Expedition took place between 1938 and 1939. It was led by Alfred Ritscher (1879–1963).

=== Germany ===
==== Hedeby ====
Excavations that had been ongoing at Hedeby since 1930 were formally put under the aegis of Ahnenerbe in 1938 by Jankuhn.

==== Baden-Württemberg ====
In 1937–1938, Gustav Riek led an excavation at the &quot;Heuneburg&quot; on the Danube in Baden-Württemberg, where an ancient fortress had been discovered much earlier. The Ahnenerbe thus won out over Hans Reinerth of the who had competed for the excavation. Riek focused on the burial mound known as where he found the main burial chamber to have been plundered in antiquity. In its direct vicinity another grave was discovered, however, that included rich grave furnishings. Due to the outbreak of war in 1939 the excavations were discontinued.

A private expedition by Richard Anders and Wiligut into the Murg Valley of northwestern Baden-Württemberg had nothing to do with the Ahnenerbe.

==== Mauern ====
The Ahnenerbe also was active in the &quot;&quot; (Mauern caves) in the Franconian Jura. R.R. Schmidt discovered red ochre, a common pigment for cave paintings made by the Cro-Magnon.

In autumn 1937, , a Frisian nationalist who had applied to the SS Excavations Department earlier that year, took over the excavation. His team proceeded to find artifacts such as burins, ivory pendants, and a woolly mammoth skeleton. They also discovered Neanderthal remains buried with what appeared to be throwing spears and javelins, a technology thought to have been developed by the Cro-Magnons.

Bohmers interpreted this to mean that Cro-Magnons had left these stones in the caves over 70,000 years before, and this was therefore the oldest Cro-Magnon site in the world. To validate his claims, Bohmers traveled around Europe speaking with colleagues and organizing exhibitions, notably in the Netherlands, Belgium and France.

=== France ===
At the Parisian Institute for Human Paleontology, Bohmers met with Abbé Henri Breuil, an expert on cave art. Breuil arranged for Bohmers to visit Trois Frères, a site whose owners allowed only a small number of visitors. First, however, Bohmers took a quick trip to London, followed by a tour of several other French points of interest: Font-de-Gaume (a site featuring Cro-Magnon cave paintings), Teyat, La Mouthe and the caves of Dordogne. Then Bohmers moved on to Les Trois-Frères.

==== Bayeux Tapestry ====
The Ahnenerbe took great interest in the 900-year-old Bayeux Tapestry. In June 1941, its staff oversaw the transport of the tapestry from its home in Bayeux Cathedral to an abbey at Juaye-Mondaye, and finally to the Château de Sourches. In August 1944, after Paris was liberated by the Allies, two members of the SS were dispatched to Paris to retrieve the tapestry, which had been moved into the basement of the Louvre. Contrary to Himmler&#x27;s orders, however, they chose not to attempt to enter the Louvre, most likely because of the strong presence of the French Resistance in the historic area.

=== Tibet ===

In 1937, Himmler decided that he could increase the Ahnenerbe&#x27;s visibility by investigating Hans F. K. Günther’s claims that early Aryans had conquered much of Asia, including attacks against China and Japan in approximately 2000 BC, and that Gautama Buddha was himself an Aryan offshoot of the Nordic race. Walther Wüst later expanded on this theory, stating in a public speech that Adolf Hitler&#x27;s ideology corresponded with that of the Buddha, since the two shared a common heritage. However, according to contemporary research Hitler himself was not interested in Buddhism or Tibet.

=== Poland ===

After the invasion of Poland in September 1939, Wolfram Sievers wrote to Himmler stressing the need to appropriate exhibits from numerous museums. Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) Franz Six oversaw , who was commanding a small team that entered Kraków to obtain the 15th-century Veit Stoss altar. Because the Poles had foreseen the German interest in the altar, they had disassembled it into 32 pieces, which were shipped to different locations, but Paulsen located each piece, and on October 14, 1939, he returned to Berlin with the altar in three small trucks and had it stored in the locked treasury of the Reichsbank. After conferring with Hitler, who had not initially been told of the operation to capture it, it was decided to send the altar to an underground vault in Nuremberg, for safety.

Reinhard Heydrich, then head of RSHA, sent Paulsen back to Kraków in order to seize additional museum collections, but Göring had already sent a team of his own men, commanded by Kajetan Mühlmann under the supervision of Dagobert Frey, to loot the museums. Mühlmann agreed to let Paulsen take items of scholarly interest back to the Ahnenerbe, while keeping artworks for Göring. During the looting, Hans Frank, the head of the German General Government in occupied Poland, issued an order dated November 22, 1939 prohibiting the “unapproved export” of Polish items. Paulsen obeyed the order, but his colleague Hans Schleif arranged for five freightcars of loot from the Warsaw Archaeological Museum to be shipped to Poznań, which was outside Frank&#x27;s control. In return, Schleif was appointed as a trustee for Wartheland. Paulsen later tried to take credit for the freightcars&#x27; contents in his report to RuSHA, but was reassigned.

Eduard Paul Tratz of the Ahnenerbe also removed some exhibits from the State Zoological Museum in Warsaw to the Haus der Natur, the museum in Salzburg of which he was founder and director.

=== Crimea ===
After the German Army conquered the Crimea in early July 1942, Himmler sent Herbert Jankuhn, as well as and Baron Wolf von Seefeld, to the region in search of artifacts to follow up the recent display of the Kerch “Gothic crown of the Crimea” in Berlin.

Jankuhn met with senior officers of 11, part of , while waiting at the field headquarters of the 5th SS Panzer Division. Commander Otto Ohlendorf gave Jankuhn information about the Crimean museums. Traveling with the 5th SS Panzer, Jankuhn&#x27;s team eventually reached Maykop, where they received a message from Sievers that Himmler wanted an investigation of Mangup Kale, an ancient mountain fortress. Jankuhn sent Kersten to follow up on Mangup Kale, while the rest of the team continued trying to secure artifacts that had not already been taken by the Red Army. 11b&#x27;s commander Werner Braune aided the team.

Jankuhn was ultimately unable to find Gothic artifacts denoting a German ancestry, even after intelligence about a shipment of 72 crates of artifacts shipped to a medical warehouse. The area had been ravaged by the time the team arrived and only 20 crates remained, but they contained Greek and stone-age artifacts, rather than Gothic.

=== Ukraine ===
In June 1943, 27-year-old SS-&quot;Untersturmführer&quot; Heinz Brücher, who held a PhD from Tübingen in botany, was tasked with an expedition to Ukraine and Crimea. Konrad von Rauch and an interpreter identified as Steinbrecher were also involved in the expedition.

In February 1945, Brücher was ordered to destroy the Ahnenerbe&#x27;s 18 active research facilities to avoid their capture by advancing Soviet forces. He refused, and after the war continued his work as a botanist in Argentina and Trinidad.

== Cancelled expeditions ==
=== Bolivia ===
After winning in a writing contest, Edmund Kiss traveled to Bolivia in 1928 to study the ruins of temples in the Andes. He claimed that their apparent similarity to ancient European structures indicated that they had been designed by Nordic migrants millions of years earlier. He also claimed that his findings supported the World Ice Theory, which held that the universe originated from a cataclysmic clash between gigantic balls of ice and glowing mass. Arthur Posnansky had been studying a local site called Tiwanaku, which he also believed supported the theory. (In reality, Tiwanuku was built in the 1st millennium AD by Amerindian peoples.)

After contacting Posnansky, Kiss approached Wüst for help planning an expedition to excavate Tiwanaku and a nearby site, Siminake. The team would consist of 20 scientists, who would excavate for a year and also explore Lake Titicaca, and take aerial photographs of ancient Incan roads they believed had Nordic roots. By late August 1939, the expedition was nearly set to embark, but the invasion of Poland caused the expedition to be postponed indefinitely.

=== Iran ===
In 1938, the Ahnenerbe&#x27;s president, Walther Wüst, proposed a trip to Iran to study the Behistun Inscription, which had been created by order of the Achaemenid Shah Darius I, who had declared himself to have been of Aryan origin in his inscriptions. The inscriptions were recorded atop steep cliffs using scaffolding that was removed after the inscriptions were made. Unable to afford the cost of erecting new scaffolds, Wüst proposed that he, his wife, an amanuensis, an Iranian student (Davud Monshizadeh), a photographer and an experienced mountaineer be sent with a balloon-mounted camera. The onset of the war, however, saw the trip postponed indefinitely.

=== Canary Islands ===
Early travelers to the Canary Islands had described the Guanche natives as having golden-blond hair and white skin, and mummies had been found with blond tresses—facts which Wirth believed indicated that the islands had once been inhabited by Nordics. His colleague Otto Huth proposed an autumn of 1939 expedition to study the ancient islanders’ racial origins, artifacts and religious rites. At the time, the Canary Islands were part of Francisco Franco’s fascist Spanish State (). Because Franco refused to side with the Axis when the war started, however, the trip was cancelled.

=== Iceland ===
Bruno Schweizer had already traveled to Iceland three times in 1938 when he proposed an Ahnenerbe expedition with seven others to the country in order to learn about their ancient farming practices and architecture, record folksongs and dances, and also collect soil samples for pollen analysis.

The first setback for the expedition was the ridicule of the Scandinavian press, publishing stories in February 1939 claiming the expedition was based on false ideas about Icelandic heritage and sought old church records that did not even exist. An enraged Himmler publicly shut down the trip, but after calming down he allowed the planning of the trip to be secretly continued. The final setback occurred when Himmler&#x27;s personal staff was unable to get enough Icelandic crowns—Iceland&#x27;s currency. Not being able to quickly solve this problem, the trip was rescheduled for the summer of 1940. In May 1940, the British invaded neutral Iceland, but when the war had started the expedition had already been shelved.

In 1940, following the British occupation of Iceland, the Ahnenerbe-funded Bruno Kress, a German researcher who was in the country at the time, was rounded up along with other German nationals present on the island. Kress was interned in Ramsey on the Isle of Man, but was allowed to correspond with Sievers through letters. Kress&#x27;s &quot;Grammar of Icelandic&quot; was eventually published in East Germany in 1955. Kress later worked for the East German (Stasi).

== Other Ahnenerbe activities ==
=== Master Plan East ===

After being appointed Commissioner for the Strengthening of the German Race, Himmler set to work with Konrad Meyer on developing a plan for three large German colonies in the eastern occupied territories. Leningrad, northern Poland and the Crimea would be the focal points of these colonies intended to spread the Aryan race. The Crimean colony was called &quot;Gotengau&quot;, &quot;Goth district&quot;, in honor of the Crimean Goths who had settled there and were believed to be Aryan ancestors of the Germans.

Himmler estimated that Aryanization of the region would take twenty years, first expelling all the undesirable populations, then re-distributing the territory to appropriate Aryan populations. In addition to changing the demographics of the region, Himmler also intended to plant oak and beech trees to replicate traditional German forests, as well as plant new crops brought back from Tibet. To achieve the latter end, Himmler ordered a new institution set up by the Ahnenerbe and headed by Schäfer. A station was then set up near the Austrian town of Graz where Schäfer set to work with seven other scientists to develop new crops for the Reich.

The final piece of the puzzle fell into place after Hitler read a work by Alfred Frauenfeld which suggested resettling inhabitants of South Tyrol, believed by some to be descendants of the Goths, to Crimea. In 1939 the South Tyroleans were ordered by Hitler and Benito Mussolini to vote on whether they wanted to remain in Italy and accept assimilation or emigrate to Germany. Over 80% chose the latter (for details see South Tyrol Option Agreement). Himmler presented the to Hitler and received approval in July 1942.

Full implementation of the plan was not feasible because of the war, but a small colony was founded around Himmler&#x27;s field headquarters at Hegewald, near Kiev. Starting on October 10, 1942, Himmler&#x27;s troops deported 10,623 Ukrainians from the area in cattle cars before bringing in trains of ethnic Germans () from northern Ukraine. The SS authorities gave families supplies as well as land, but also informed them of quotas of food they would be required to produce for the SS.

=== Failed seizure of Tacitus manuscript ===
The Ahnenerbe had tried to gain possession of the Codex Aesinas, a famous medieval copy of Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Germania&quot;. Although Mussolini had originally promised it as a gift in 1936, it remained in the possession of the Count Aurelio Baldeschi Guglielmi Balleani outside Ancona, from where the Ahnenerbe tried to obtain it after Mussolini was deposed.

=== Headquarters relocation ===
On July 29, 1943, the Royal Air Force&#x27;s firebombing of Hamburg led Himmler to order the immediate evacuation of the main Ahnenerbe headquarters in Berlin. The extensive library was moved to Schloss Oberkirchberg near Ulm while the staff was moved to the tiny village of Waischenfeld near Bayreuth, Bavaria. The building selected was the 17th century . While much of the staff was not ecstatic about the primitive conditions, Sievers seemed to have embraced the isolation.

== Financing ==
Financially, the Ahnenerbe was separate from the Nazi Party treasury and had to find funding from other sources including membership dues and donations. After 1938, it received funds from the . In addition, a foundation () was established, set up with funds from business leaders. One of the largest donations, approximately , came from Deutsche Bank boardmember Emil Georg von Stauß associates, including BMW and Daimler-Benz. The foundation also received royalties from patents partially held by the SS (see below). During the war, Ahnenerbe also received money from other SS departments and profited from the of Jewish property—its headquarters in Dahlem had been purchased at half its market value. In 1940, another estate in Munich was added.

In 1936, the SS formed a joint company with Anton Loibl, a machinist and driving instructor. The SS had heard about reflector pedals for bicycles, that Loibl and others had been developing. Assuring that Loibl got the patent himself, Himmler then used his political weight to ensure the passing of a 1939 law requiring the use of the new reflective pedals—of which the Ahnenerbe received a share of the profits, in 1938.

== Medical experiments ==
The (&quot;Institute for Military Scientific Research&quot;), which conducted extensive medical experiments using human subjects, became attached to the Ahnenerbe during World War II. It was managed by Wolfram Sievers. Sievers had founded the organization on the orders of Himmler, who appointed him director with two divisions headed by Sigmund Rascher and August Hirt, and funded by the Waffen-SS.

=== Dachau ===
Sigmund Rascher was tasked with helping the Luftwaffe determine what was safe for their pilots—because aircraft were being built to fly higher than ever before. He applied for and received permission from Himmler to requisition camp prisoners to place in vacuum chambers to simulate the high altitude conditions that pilots might face.

Rascher was also tasked with discovering how long German airmen would be able to survive if shot down above freezing water. His victims were forced to remain out of doors naked in freezing weather for up to 14 hours, or kept in a tank of icewater for 3 hours, their pulse and internal temperature measured through a series of electrodes. Warming of the victim was then attempted by different methods, most usually and successfully by immersion in very hot water, and also less conventional methods such as placing the subject in bed with women who would try to sexually stimulate him, a method suggested by Himmler.

Rascher experimented with the effects of Polygal, a substance made from beets and apple pectin, on coagulating blood flow to help with gunshot wounds. Subjects were given a Polygal tablet, and shot through the neck or chest, or their limbs amputated without anaesthesia. Rascher published an article on his experience of using Polygal, without detailing the nature of the human trials, and also set up a company to manufacture the substance, staffed by prisoners.

Similar experiments were conducted from July to September 1944, as the Ahnenerbe provided space and materials to doctors at Dachau concentration camp to undertake “seawater experiments”, chiefly through Sievers. Sievers is known to have visited Dachau on July 20, to speak with Ploetner and the non-Ahnenerbe Wilhelm Beiglboeck, who ultimately carried out the experiments.

=== Skulls ===
Walter Greite rose to leadership of the Ahnenerbe&#x27;s &quot;Applied Nature Studies&quot; division in January 1939, and began taking detailed measurements of 2,000 Jews at the Vienna emigration office—but scientists were unable to use the data. On December 10, 1941, Bruno Beger met with Sievers and convinced him of the need for 120 Jewish skulls. During the later Nuremberg Trials, Friedrich Hielscher testified that Sievers had initially been repulsed at the idea of expanding the Ahnenerbe to human experimentation, and that he had “no desire whatsoever to participate in these.”
* Jewish skull collection: Beger collaborated with August Hirt, of the Reich University of Strassburg, in creating a Jewish skeleton collection for research. The bodies of 86 Jewish men and women were ultimately collected and macerated.

== Post-World War II ==
=== Trials ===
* Wolfram Sievers: In Waischenfeld American troops captured a slew of documents that would be used in the case against Sievers which would be a part of the Doctors&#x27; Trial. Sievers was charged for aiding in the Jewish skull collection and human medical experiments at Dachau and Natzweiler. In his defense, Sievers claimed he had helped a resistance group since 1929, which was supported by testimony from Friedrich Hielscher on April 15, 1947. Sievers was nevertheless found guilty on all four counts on August 21, 1947, and sentenced to death. He was hanged on June 2, 1948, at Landsberg Prison.
* Richard Walther Darré: One of the founders of the Ahnenerbe, Darré was tried in the Ministries Trial. He received seven years imprisonment after being found not guilty on more serious charges.
* Edmund Kiss: His Bolivia trip having been cancelled, Kiss served in the armed forces the rest of the war, taking command of SS men at Wolfschanze near the end. He was interned in the Darmstadt camp after the war, but was released in June 1947 due to severe diabetes. His de-Nazification classification was as a “major offender”. This allowed him to only take a manual labor job. Following this decision, Kiss hired a lawyer to protest this decision, a major component of his case being he had never been a member of the Nazi Party. After somewhat renouncing his past, Kiss was reclassified as a &quot;Mitläufer&quot; in 1948 and fined 501 DM.
* Walther Wüst: Although the president of the Ahnenerbe from 1937 until the end of the war, Wüst&#x27;s claims that he was unaware of any medical experiments were acknowledged, and in 1950 he was classified as a &quot;Mitläufer&quot; and released, returning to the University of Munich as a professor-in-reserve.
* Bruno Beger: In February 1948, Beger was classified as &quot;exonerated&quot; by a denazification tribunal unaware of his role in the skeleton collection. In 1960, an investigation into the collection began in Ludwigsburg, and Beger was taken into custody on March 30, 1960. He was released four months later, but the investigation continued until coming to trial on October 27, 1970. Beger claimed that he was unaware the Auschwitz prisoners he measured were to be killed. While two others indicted in the trial were released, Beger was convicted on April 6, 1971, and sentenced to three years in prison for being an accomplice in the murder of 86 Jews. Neither of his colleagues with whom he was tried, Hans Fleischhacker and Wolf-Dietrich Wolff, was convicted.

== Legacy ==
=== Academic study ===
During the 20th century, little scholarly research into the Ahnenerbe took place. Many scholars had likely been dissuaded from exploring the subject because ex-Ahnenerbe members held prominent academic positions in West Germany and did not want younger historians or archaeologists investigating their links with the SS. The main scholar to explore the subject in this period was a Canadian historian, Michael Kater, who conducted his research while in Germany. As the University of Heidelberg sought to publish Kater&#x27;s thesis on the subject in 1966, Walther Wüst unsuccessfully tried to legally prevent it from doing so. Kater&#x27;s research was then published in 1974 as &quot;Das &quot;Ahnenerbe&quot; der SS 1935–1945&quot;.

Following German unification in 1990, Achim Leube began an examination of the surviving historical evidence on the Ahnenerbe, much of which had been based in West Germany. In November 1998, Leube oversaw an international academic conference in Berlin on the Nazis&#x27; relationship with prehistory.

=== Influence in pseudo-archaeology ===
Many of the ideas inherited or developed by the Ahnenerbe remain influential. Canadian author Heather Pringle has particularly drawn attention to the influence of Edmund Kiss&#x27; various &quot;crackpot theories&quot; concerning such matters as the World Ice Theory and the origins of Tiwanaku upon subsequent writers such as H.S. Bellamy, Denis Saurat and, later, Graham Hancock.

== In popular culture ==

Much misinformation about the Ahnenerbe has circulated, due in part to adaptations of the group in fiction, and historically dubious conspiracy theories that sometimes confuse the Ahnenerbe with the roughly contemporaneous Thule Society, or the historically unverified Vril society.

The Ahnenerbe formed the basis for the depiction in the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; franchise of Nazis searching for religious artifacts.

<doc id="423023" wikidata="Q3487408" url="?curid=423023" title="Socialism from below (organization)">
<text>Socialism from below (&quot;Socialisme par en bas&quot;, SPEB), founded in 1997 and disbanded in 2007, was one of two socialist groups in France based on the International Socialism tradition of the Trotskyist movement. It was affiliated to the International Socialist Tendency led by the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) in Britain.

Its origins lay in a small group of former members of Lutte Ouvriere who left that group in 1974 expecting to join a larger group, Union Ouvrier, which had broken from LO the previous year. They found that UO had already disintegrated, its members going in many directions. Therefore, they formed a group of their own, initially named Combat Communiste.

Some members of Combat Communiste were won over to the positions of the International Socialists (IS, forerunner of the SWP) and sought to win other militants to their views before launching an independent group of their own. They joined the Ligue Communiste Revolutionnaire (LCR) to further that aim and later left to found the Socialisme International group.

During the 1990s, Tony Cliff, leading theoretician in the British Socialist Workers Party encouraged Socialisme International to follow the successful example of Linksruck (which entered the youth section of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) and grew substantially) and join the French Socialist Party. This caused a split, with some members founding a small group called Socialisme, some leaving entirely, and the remainder renaming themselves Socialisme Par En Bas. In the event the tactic was disastrous and SPEB left the Socialist Party again shortly afterwards.

SPEB grew somewhat during the radicalisation in France in the late 1990s around the anti-capitalist movement, but was still too small to take full advantage. It joined ATTAC en masse, but when the latter began to lose the initiative and stall in the aftermath of 9/11, it started to concentrate its efforts on building Agir Contre La Guerre (Act Against the War). Following the relatively good showing for the far left in the French presidential elections in 2002, SPEB advocated the &#x27;unity of the revolutionary left&#x27;, and applied to join the LCR as an official faction. This move was supported by the British SWP, which at that time was starting to develop closer relations with the LCR.

In late January 2004 SPEB, then numbering approximately 50 militants, was permitted to join the LCR as a faction. Socialisme International (the Socialisme group renamed), by then much smaller, had joined the LCR some months previously. SPEB disbanded in early 2007.</text><links>

<text>A content package is a file containing content in a database metadata. 

A content package is used in e-learning to define some learning content or an assessment that can be delivered, for example by a Learning Management System. It&#x27;s a standard way of describing learning content that can be read by many programs. 

The most widely used content packaging format is that defined by IMS Global, which uses an XML manifest file called imsmanifest.xml wrapped up inside a zip file. The learning content itself is either included in the zip file if it is HTML or other media that can run on its own, or else is referenced as a URL from within the manifest.

The IMS format was used by SCORM to define their packaging format, and typically every sharable content object (SCO) is defined by a content package.

The AICC also define a content package format for material that can be called by the widely used AICC HACP standard. Their format consists of four comma separated ASCII files that define details about the learning content including a URL.

<doc id="423033" wikidata="Q5614792" url="?curid=423033" title="Guelph Mercury">
<text>The Guelph Mercury was an English language daily newspaper published in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. It published a mix of community, national and international news and is owned by the Torstar Corporation. The newspaper, in many incarnations, was a part of the community since 1854. It was one of the oldest broadsheet newspapers in Ontario. Publication was discontinued in late January 2016.

== History ==
The &quot;Wellington Mercury&quot; was founded in 1853, and published weekly by owner George Keeling.

A competing paper was started in 1854, named the &quot;Guelph Advertiser&quot;. It was published weekly as well.

In 1862, Toronto newspaperman and MP James Innes took over the editorship of the &quot;Guelph Advertiser&quot; and shortly thereafter formed a partnership with John McLagan, owner of the competing weekly newspaper the &quot;Guelph Mercury&quot;.

The two papers merged to form the &quot;Mercury and Advertiser&quot;. &quot;The Mercury&quot; was expanded into a daily newspaper in 1867. Among its editors was the future best-selling novelist Thomas B. Costain who worked there from 1908 to 1910. &quot;The Guelph Mercury&quot; has since had numerous owners. Innes sold his share in the newspaper in 1905 to J. Innes McIntosh, who also bought the &quot;Guelph Herald&quot;, a competing daily newspaper, in 1924. McIntosh then sold his share in 1929 to James Playfair, who sold the paper in the late 1940s to Thomson Newspapers. Thomson remained owner for half a century, until Hollinger Inc. purchased the paper in 1995. Sun Media purchased the paper in 1998 and then resold it to Torstar.

&quot;The Guelph Mercury&quot; was then published six days a week by Metroland Media Group, a subsidiary of Torstar Corporation. The newspaper also published a free weekly roundup for some time as well as various other special publications. A magazine, &quot;Guelph Life&quot;, was cancelled as a cost-cutting measure in 2009 but restored in 2015; it continued after the &quot;Guelph Mercury&quot; ceased publication in early 2016. The Mercury was one of few Metroland newspapers still to have their own presses since the Mercury&#x27;s sister paper, the &quot;Waterloo Region Record&quot;, is printed at another Torstar site, &quot;The Hamilton Spectator&quot; in Hamilton, Ontario. In February 2009, Torstar announced layoffs across the chain, including 13 newsroom staff at the &quot;Guelph Mercury&quot;. According to the announcement, copy editing and page production of the paper will be transferred to the &quot;Waterloo Region Record&quot;, reducing the editorial staff of the paper to two managers and eight reporter–photographers. Both the &quot;Guelph Tribune&quot; and &quot;Guelph Mercury&quot; are owned and published by Metroland Media Group but keep separate newsrooms and operations. The Guelph Mercury&#x27;s Goss Urbanite Press was shut down on February 7, 2014, at which time printing moved to the &quot;Hamilton Spectator&quot;.

== Publication discontinued ==
On January 25, 2016, Metroland Media Group announced that the &quot;Guelph Mercury&quot; would publish its final issue on January 29, 2016, citing a difficulty in remaining profitable because of declining circulation (9,000 subscriptions at that time) and difficulty obtaining national advertising. All of the staff were laid off. At the time of the announcement, there was an indication that some content would continue to be published on the newspaper&#x27;s web site. Metroland Media Group confirmed that it would continue publishing news and &quot;unique local content&quot; through its twice-weekly &quot;Guelph Tribune&quot; which is distributed free of charge. As well, the &quot;Mercury&quot;″s real estate section, &quot;Guelph and District Homes&quot;, would continue to be printed and distributed.

By April 2016, the &quot;Guelph Tribune&quot; had increased its coverage of local news and rebranded with a new title, &quot;Guelph Mercury Tribune&quot;. At the same time, the &quot;Guelph Mercury Tribune&quot; started using the website www.guelphmercury.com as its main location for online local news, information and advertising.

<text>KEO is the name of a proposed space time capsule which was to have been launched in 2003 carrying messages from the citizens of present Earth to humanity 50,000 years from now, when it would re-enter Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Its name represents the three most frequently used sounds common to the most widely spoken languages today, , , and . Everyone was invited to contribute to the time capsule, and the organizers encouraged everybody to gather messages from children, senior citizens, and the illiterate so that every culture and demographic on Earth was represented. Moreover, the organizers were committed to not filtering the messages, stating &quot;all the messages received, without undergoing any censorship, will be embarked aboard KEO.&quot; The launch has been delayed several times due to major geopolitical shakeups, including 9/11 and the restructuring of the ESA. , no launch date has been confirmed.

== Contents ==
*Personal messages
*A sample of air
*A sample of sea water
*A sample of earth
*A diamond that encases a drop of human blood chosen at random with the DNA of the human genome engraved on one of its facets. 
*An astronomical clock that shows the current rotation rates of several pulsars
*Photographs of people of all cultures
* &quot;the contemporary Library of Alexandria&quot;, an encyclopedic compendium of current human knowledge.

== Technical aspects ==
The messages and library will be encoded in glass-made radiation-resistant DVDs. Symbolic instructions in several formats will show the future finders how to build a DVD reader. 

The satellite has enough capacity to carry a four-page message from each of the more than six billion (as of the original 2009 deadline) inhabitants on the planet. Once the satellite is launched, the messages will be made freely available on the web.

The satellite itself is a hollow sphere 80 cm in diameter. The sphere is engraved with a map of Earth and surrounded by an aluminium layer, a thermal layer and several layers of titanium and other heavy materials intertwined with vacuum. The sphere is resistant to cosmic radiation, atmosphere re-entry, space junk impacts, etc. For its first few years in orbit, KEO will sport a pair of wings 10 meters across that will aid in its spotting from Earth. As the satellite enters the atmosphere, the thermal layer will produce an artificial aurora to give a signal of the satellite&#x27;s re-entry. The passive satellite will not carry any communications or propulsion systems. It was planned to be launched by an Ariane 5 rocket (which was discontinued in 2023, and replaced by Ariane 6) into an orbit 1,800 km high, an altitude that will bring it back to Earth in 500 centuries, the same amount of time that has elapsed since early humans started to draw on cavern walls.

== Timeline ==
== Popular culture ==
* &quot;Life After People&quot;: Season 2 Episode 3, &quot;Crypt of Civilization&quot;, mentions KEO as one of the last time capsules in the universe.

<text>USS &quot;O-5&quot; (SS-66) was one of 16 O-class submarines built for the United States Navy during World War I.

==Description==
The O-class submarines were designed to meet a Navy requirement for coastal defense boats. The submarines had a length of overall, a beam of and a mean draft of . They displaced on the surface and submerged. The O-class submarines had a crew of 29 officers and enlisted men. They had a diving depth of .

For surface running, the boats were powered by two NELSECO diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a New York Navy Yard electric motor. Power for the two electric motors is provided by a pair of 60-cell batteries. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the O class had a range of at .

The boats were armed with four 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes in the bow. They carried four reloads, for a total of eight torpedoes. The O-class submarines were also armed with a single retractable 3&quot;/50 caliber deck gun.

==Construction and career==
&quot;O-5&quot; was laid down on 8 December 1916 by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company of Quincy, Massachusetts. She was launched on 11 November 1917, and commissioned on 8 June 1918 with Lieutenant commander George A. Trever in command. During the final months of World War I, &quot;O-5&quot; operated along the Atlantic coast and patrolled from Cape Cod to Key West, Florida. On October 6, 1918 &quot;O-5&quot; was at the Brooklyn Navy Yard when Lieutenant (Junior Grade) William J. Sharkey noticed that the submarine&#x27;s batteries were giving off toxic gas. Sharkey informed his commanding officer and the two went forward in the submarine to investigate. The batteries then exploded killing LTJG Sharkey and fatally injuring LCDR Trevor. LTJG Sharkey was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross. &quot;O-5&quot; departed Newport, Rhode Island on 3 November 1918 with a 20-submarine contingent bound for European waters; however, hostilities had ceased before the vessels reached the Azores.

After the Armistice with Germany, &quot;O-5&quot; operated from the Submarine School at New London, Connecticut until 1923. &quot;O-5&quot; then sailed to Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, for a brief tour. On 28 October, as &quot;O-5&quot; entered Bahía Limón, preparatory to transiting the Panama Canal, she was rammed by the United Fruit Company steamer &quot;Abangarez&quot; and sank in less than a minute. Three men died; 16 others escaped Two crewmembers, Henry Breault and Lawrence Brown, were trapped in the forward torpedo room, which they sealed against the flooding of the submarine. Local engineers and divers were able to rig cranes and other equipment and lift &quot;O-5&quot; far enough off the bottom that the bow broke the surface, exposing a hatch which led to the compartment where the two men were trapped, allowing them to be freed. Henry Breault was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.

Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 April 1924, she was raised and later sold as a hulk to R.K. Morris in Balboa, Panama, on 12 December 1924. The sinking made &quot;O-5&quot; valueless for future naval service. She was stripped of valuable fittings and equipment when sold for $3,125. Her original cost had been $638,000.

==Recovery of &quot;O-5&quot;==
On 28 October 1923, &quot;O-5&quot; was operating with other units of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet under the command of Commander Submarine Force, Coco Solo, Canal Zone. At approximately 0630, &quot;O-5&quot;, under the command of Lieutenant Harrison Avery, was underway across Bahía Limón toward the entrance to the Panama Canal. The steamship SS &quot;Abangarez&quot;, owned by the United Fruit Company and captained by Master W.A. Card, was underway toward Dock No. 6 at Cristobal. Through a series of maneuvering errors and miscommunication, the SS &quot;Abangarez&quot; collided with the &quot;O-5&quot; and struck the submarine on the starboard side of the control room, opening a hole some ten feet long and penetrating the number one main ballast tank. The submarine rolled sharply to port – then back to starboard – and sank bow first in 42 feet of water.

Salvage efforts began immediately, and divers were sent down from a salvage tug that arrived from Coco Solo. By 10:00am, they were on the bottom examining the wreck. To search for trapped personnel, they hammered on the hull near the aft end of the ship and worked forward. Upon reaching the torpedo room, they heard answering hammer blows from inside the boat. In 1923 the only way the salvage crew could get the men out of the submarine was to lift it physically from the mud using cranes or pontoons. One of the largest crane barges in the world, &quot;Ajax&quot;, built specifically for handling the gates of the canal locks, was in the Canal Zone. However, there had been a landslide at the famous Gaillard Cut and &quot;Ajax&quot; was on the other side of the slide, assisting in clearing the Canal. The excavation shifted into high gear and by 2:00pm on the afternoon of the sinking, the crane barge &quot;Ajax&quot; squeezed through and was on its way to the &quot;O-5&quot; site.

Divers worked to tunnel under &quot;O-5&quot;″s bow so lifting cables could be attached. &quot;Ajax&quot; arrived about midnight, and by early morning, the cable tunnel had been dug, the cable run, and a lift was attempted. Sheppard J. Shreaves, supervisor of the Panama Canal&#x27;s salvage crew and himself a qualified diver, had been working continuously throughout the night to dig the tunnel, snake the cable under the submarine, and hook it to &quot;Ajax’s&quot; hoist. Now the lift began. As the crane took a strain, the lift cables broke. Shreaves and his crew worked another cable set under the bow and again &quot;Ajax&quot; pulled. Again, the cable broke. All through the day, the men worked. Shreaves had been in his diving suit nearly 24 hours. As noon on the 29th approached, the crane was ready for another lift, this time with buoyancy being added by blowing water out of the flooded Engine Room. Then, just after noontime, the bow of &quot;O-5&quot; broke the surface. Men from the salvage force quickly opened the torpedo room hatch, and Breault and Brown emerged into the fresh air.

==Brown&#x27;s Account==

Breault and I separated to pound on each of the boat’s sides. In this way, the rescuers would know that there were two of us. Breault played a kind of tune with his hammer, indicating to the diver that we were in good shape and cheerful. Neither of us knew Morse Code. We had no food or water, and only a flashlight. We were confident we could stay alive for forty-eight hours. ...The high pressure and foul air gave us severe headaches. We did very little moving or talking; it excited our hearts too much. ...We heard scraping on the hull for hours. A couple of times we felt the O-5 being lifted, and then we got tossed roughly when the slings broke. We knew they were hard after us. This buoyed our hopes for rescue tremendously. ...Finally, the sub began to be tilted upward slowly. We felt we would escape this time, but it seemed like forever. The last 20 minutes were unbearable. We heard our comrades walking on deck. Breault opened the hatch and we could see daylight. We were saved!!!

==Aftermath==
Lieutenant Harrison Avery was held responsible for the collision on 26 November 1923, but a later Court of Naval Inquiry cleared the &quot;O-5&quot; of blame for the collision. At the time of his death, in October 1934, Lieutenant Commander Avery commanded the of the Asiatic Fleet.

United States vs. United Fruit Company (Submarine &quot;O-5&quot; – &quot;SS Abangarez&quot;) continued in the courts. Federal Judge Wayne G. Borah, New Orleans, on 20 August 1932, ruled &quot;O-5&quot; was at fault in the collision.

&quot;O-5&quot; was sticken from the Navy List on 28 April 1924 and sold for scrap on 12 December 1924.

<text>Cerro Maravilla is Puerto Rico&#x27;s fourth highest peak at . It is located on the northern edge Barrio Anón in Ponce, close to the border with the municipality Jayuya, and is part of the Cordillera Central (Central Mountain Range). It is known as &quot;El Cerro de los Mártires&quot; (&quot;Mountain of the Martyrs&quot;) and characterized as the most infamous peak in Puerto Rico, due to the 1978 Cerro Maravilla murders which took place here.

==Location and access==
The peak is located at the end of the 0.5 km-long Puerto Rico Highway 577, which is accessible via Puerto Rico Highway 143, traveling either westbound or eastbound. PR-143 is a secondary two-way, two-lane mountainous road that is relatively well traveled. The peak&#x27;s coordinates are: .

The height of the mountain makes for some interesting sights. For example, on clear days both the northern and southern coasts of the island can be appreciated simultaneously. In the winter season, the air is crisp and the temperature at night will usually fluctuate between the 40s and 60s degrees Fahrenheit. The chirping of the familiar &quot;coquis&quot; is prominent after nightfall.

==Cerro Maravilla incident==
The peak might be best known for being the place where two Puerto Rico independence activists were slain on 25 July 1978 in a police ambush (see Cerro Maravilla murders.) This controversy has since turned the mountain into a meeting point for supporters of the independence of the Puerto Rican Commonwealth to gather annually to remember the murdered activists and condemn the current colonial status.

==Climate==
Cerro Maravilla has a subtropical highland climate (Cfb) under the Köppen climate classification. The surrounding area over is one of the few places in the island to have a true temperate climate. Although the temperature remains mild year round, night temperatures in winter may reach the mid 40s at times.

<doc id="423043" wikidata="Q394084" url="?curid=423043" title="Quadrille">
<text>The quadrille is a dance that was fashionable in late 18th- and 19th-century Europe and its colonies. The quadrille consists of a chain of four to six &quot;contredanses&quot;. Latterly the quadrille was frequently danced to a medley of opera melodies.

Performed by four couples in a rectangular formation, it is related to American square dancing. The quadrille also gave rise to Cape Breton Square Dancing via American square dancing in New England. The Lancers, a variant of the quadrille, became popular in the late 19th century and was still danced in the 20th century in folk-dance clubs. A derivative found in the Francophone Lesser Antilles is known as &quot;kwadril&quot;, and the dance is also still found in Madagascar as well as old Caribbean culture.

==History==
The term &quot;quadrille&quot; originated in 17th-century military parades in which four mounted horsemen executed square formations. The word probably derived from the Italian &quot;quadriglia&quot; (diminutive of &quot;quadra&quot;, hence a small square).

The dance was introduced in France around 1760: originally it was a form of cotillion in which only two couples were used, but two more couples were eventually added to form the sides of a square. The couples in each corner of the square took turns, in performing the dance, where one couple danced, and the other couples rested. The &quot;quadrille des contredanses&quot; was now a lively dance with four couples, arranged in the shape of a square, each couple facing the center. One pair was called the &quot;head&quot; couple, the adjacent pairs the &quot;side&quot; couples. A dance figure was often performed first by the head couple and then repeated by the side couples. Terms used in the dance are mostly the same as those in ballet, such as &quot;jeté, chassé, croisé, plié&quot; and &quot;arabesque&quot;.

Reaching English high society in 1816 through Lady Jersey, the quadrille became a craze. As it became ever more popular in the 19th century it evolved into forms that used elements of the waltz, including The Caledonians and The Lancers. In Germany and Austria dance composers (Josef Lanner and the Strauss family) composed for the quadrille. Its popularity made it a metaphor, the &quot;stately quadrille&quot;, of the constant formation of fresh political alliances with different partners in order to maintain the balance of power in Europe. Lewis Carroll lampooned the dance in &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;″s &quot;The Lobster Quadrille&quot; (1865).

Though new music was composed, the names of the five parts (or &quot;figures&quot;) remained the same, as did the steps and the figures themselves. The parts were called:

# &quot;Le Pantalon&quot; (&quot;Trousers&quot;)
# &quot;L&#x27;été&quot; (&quot;Summer&quot;)
# &quot;La Poule&quot; (The Hen&quot;)
# &quot;La Pastourelle&quot; (&quot;The Shepherd Girl&quot;)
# &quot;Finale&quot;

All the parts were popular dances and songs from that time (19th century): &quot;Le Pantalon&quot; was a popular song, the second and third part were popular dances, &quot;La Pastourelle&quot; was a well-known ballad by the cornet player Collinet. The finale was very lively.

Sometimes &quot;La Pastourelle&quot; was replaced by another figure; &quot;La Trénis&quot;. This was a figure made by the dance master Trenitz. In the Viennese version of the quadrille both figures were used: &quot;La Trénis&quot; became the fourth part, and La Pastourelle the fifth, making a total of six parts.

Notable quadrilles include among others the following: Le beau monde, Le piège de Méduse and Le prophète (the quadrille from the latter was also included in the arrangement Les Patineurs).

==The quadrille – musical analysis==
Thus the quadrille was a very intricate dance. The &quot;standard&quot; form contained five different parts, and the Viennese lengthened it to six different parts. The following table shows what the different parts look like, musically speaking:
* part 1: Pantalon (&quot;written in &quot;&quot; or &quot;)
*: theme A – theme B – theme A – theme C – theme A
* part 2: Été (&quot;always written in &quot;)
*: theme A – theme B – theme B – theme A
* part 3: Poule (&quot;always written in &quot;)
*: theme A – theme B – theme A – theme C – theme A – theme B – theme A
** &quot;Part 3 always begins with a two-measure introduction&quot;
* part 4: Trénis (&quot;always written in &quot;)
*: theme A – theme B – theme B – theme A
* part 5: Pastourelle (&quot;always written in &quot;)
*: theme A – theme B – theme C – theme B – theme A
* part 6: Finale (&quot;always written in &quot;)
*: theme A – theme A – theme B – theme B – theme A – theme A
** &quot;Part 6 always begins with a two-measure introduction&quot;

All the themes are 8 measures long.

<doc id="423045" wikidata="Q3506099" url="?curid=423045" title="Suzie Q (dance move)">
<text>The Suzie Q (also Susie Q, Suzy Q or Susy Q) is a dance step in the Big Apple, Lindy Hop, Salsa, and other dances. In line dances this step is also known as heel twist (actually refers to step 2) or grind walk. The step is also used in jazz dance, and in Salsa shines.

The step originated from a novelty dance of the 1930s with the same name addressed in the 1936 song &quot;Doin&#x27; the Suzie-Q&quot; by Lil Hardin Armstrong.

== Name origin ==
The origin of the name &quot;Suzie Q&quot; is uncertain. 
* An obituary published in &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; on September 21, 2008 for Susie Jane Dwyer (maiden name Quealy) (April 24, 1915 – September 17, 2008) of San Francisco makes the claim that &quot;The popular song hit of the era, &#x27;Doin&#x27; the Susie Q&#x27; was written in her honor.&quot;
* A December 12, 1936 news story claimed that the Suzie Q dance was introduced by two dancers from Georgia. The dancers had previously performed and introduced the dance at Syracuse, New York, but the audience misheard “Syracuse” as “Susie-Q.”

==The step==
The feet perform alternating cross steps and side steps with swivel action, as follows.

*On 1, put the right foot on the heel across the left foot and put the weight on this heel, the toe being on the floor. 
*On 2, swivel on the heel, the right toe swinging to the right, while doing a small step by the left foot to the side, almost in place or simply transferring the weight onto the left foot, or stepping slightly back.

Step 1 may also be accompanied with a light swivel of the left toe.

One may continue in one of the ways:
*Repeat steps 1 and 2 several times.
*or
** On 3, step with the right foot to the right.
** On 4, bring the left foot together or step across the right foot.
** repeat steps 1, 2, 3, 4.
*or (change of direction)
**On 3, step with the right foot to the right.
**On 4, do nothing.
**5, 6, 7, 8 do any of the three patterns from the opposite foot.

===Partnered Suzy Qs===
In Lindy Hop, Suzy Qs can be performed by couples, either facing each other in open position, or side by side.

ITN announced in the late summer of 1999 that it was set to launch its own news channel, initially by the end of the year, with the aim of competing against BBC News 24, Sky News and CNN International. Taking a long time to launch the channel would undermine ITN&#x27;s efficacy within a few years.

The channel launched on 1 August 2000 as a joint venture between ITN and NTL as the ITN News Channel. The channel was touted as &quot;the world&#x27;s first multimedia news channel&quot;, with availability on digital radio and mobile phones, in conjunction to the existing television platforms.

===As ITV News Channel===
In June 2002, Carlton Television and Granada Television – the predecessors of ITV plc – bought out ITN&#x27;s 65% stake. This led to a rebrand as the ITV News Channel in September 2002.

From the February 2004 relaunch, the channel came into its own. Along with the rest of ITV News, the channel was presented from the so-called &quot;theatre of news&quot; set, a large virtual studio allowing presentation either from behind a desk or by presenters walking around, using the news wall to explain a story with the aid of graphics. For the first time, two presenters could present the channel together, which the management viewed as an improvement.

In April 2004, the newly created ITV plc bought NTL&#x27;s 35% stake to assume full control of the channel.

===Closure===
On 15 December 2005, it was confirmed that the channel would close down in 2006, in order to use its Freeview bandwidth (which was already timeshared with ITV4) to launch the CITV channel based on the existing CITV brand, and to use its funding to boost ITV News coverage on the main ITV Network. ITV stated that it would launch new bulletins on ITV2 &amp; ITV3, but this did not materialise.

The closure was subsequently brought forward and the channel closed down on Friday 23 December 2005 at 18:00 (GMT). The reason given was that it would have been unfair to expect the channel&#x27;s staff to work long hours over Christmas knowing that the channel would soon be closing.

The schedule for the last day of transmission on the ITV News Channel:

*07:00 – &quot;The Scott Chisholm Show&quot;
*10:00 – &quot;ITV News Live with Alastair Stewart&quot;
*11:45 – &quot;The Scott Chisholm Show&quot;
*12:30 – &quot;ITV Lunchtime News&quot; simulcast
*13:30 – &quot;ITV News Live with Faye Barker&quot;
*15:00 – &quot;ITV News Live with Nicholas Owen and Nina Hossain&quot;
*16:00 – &quot;ITV News Live with Owen Thomas and Faye Barker&quot;
*17:30 – Special: &quot;Five Years of the News Channel&quot;, presented by Alastair Stewart
At the end of the final programme, Alastair Stewart closed the channel with the words:
The picture then faded out to a blank screen for three seconds before fading back in to the ITN end board. The station closed shortly afterwards.

===Post-closure===
On 15 June 2007, ITN chief executive Mark Wood said the company would not rule out launching another 24-hour TV news channel. There was also speculation that cable group Virgin Media was considering launching its own news channel to rival Sky News and BBC News, with some reports suggesting that it might look to partner with ITN. Later that year, Setanta Sports News was launched, a tie up between Virgin Media and ITN which lasted until 2009.

In July 2022, it was reported that the new streaming platform ITVX would feature an ITV News 24/7 service. The service would provide ITV News around the clock as well as providing an on-demand service for in-depth investigations, explanatory and eye-witness journalism. The service would not be a conventional rolling news channel but it would have occasional live programmes and bulletins. Instead, the service would focus on video on-demand content which would be continuously updated. ITVX began rolling out on 17 November 2022, and fully launched on 8 December 2022.

== Programming and presentation==
News content and programming for the channel was provided by ITN.

As the ITN News Channel, it was broadcast from a small studio with accommodation for only one presenter at a time. When relaunched as the ITV News Channel, it initially used the standard ITV News studio of the time, which was built for fixed length bulletins only, so the style of presentation was always more basic than that of its competitors.

As the channel shared facilities with ITV News bulletins on the ITV network (which were also simulcast on the news channel), it had to move to other studios for around an hour before each ITV bulletin to allow for rehearsals. Initially a single locked-off camera studio was used at these times, which was very basic. Later the channel used a virtual reality studio at these times or, following ITN&#x27;s takeover of the production of &quot;London Tonight&quot;, that studio.

The channel used to broadcast live ITV Sport coverage of UEFA Champions League football matches whenever two British teams were playing simultaneously.When a breaking news bulletin was being reported, the news report would take the full screen while the football would be shown in an inset in the corner.

==Presenters==
During the period as the ITN News Channel, its pool of presenters were from across the ITN programme portfolio of ITV News, Channel 4 News and 5 News, along with occasional freelancers. Presenters included John Suchet, John Nicolson, Leyla Daybelge, Alison Bell, Andrew Harvey, Sharon Grey, Owen Thomas, Ian Axton, Kirsty Lang, Simon Vigar, Lloyd Bracey, Sasha Herriman and Rachel McTavish.

When the channel became the ITV News Channel, presenters from ITV News on the ITV Network began presenting the news channel. For the first month of so before any regular appearances occurred, many reporters also presented on the News Channel, including Ros Childs, who presented after John Suchet on the first day after the rebranding to the ITV News Channel. During the Iraq war the well-known British newscaster Angela Rippon presented on the channel and then went on to host a regular weekend programme in 2004 and 2005.

Following the February 2004 relaunch, presenters included ITN veteran Alastair Stewart who hosted the flagship &quot;Live with Alastair Stewart&quot; programme every weekday morning. Andrew Harvey, Lucy Alexander, Leyla Daybelge, Chris Rogers, Phil Gayle, Owen Thomas and Sasha Herriman were also used. All of ITV News&#x27; main presenters, with the exception of Trevor McDonald, had also appeared on the channel. Presenters from ITV&#x27;s regional news programmes and freelancers also regularly appeared on the channel at weekends and holiday periods.

In December 2005 Scott Chisholm, part of the original 1989 Sky News team, joined the channel to present the breakfast programme, which lasted just two weeks due to the channel&#x27;s closure.

From the 2 February 2004 relaunch, the channel&#x27;s typical weekday schedule was usually the following:

* 05:30 – &quot;ITV Morning News&quot;, simulcast live with ITV
* 06:00 – Repeats of &quot;ITV Morning News&quot;
* 07:00 – &quot;ITV News Live&quot; with Lucy Alexander and Andrew Harvey
* 10:00 – &quot;ITV News Live&quot; with Alastair Stewart And Lucy Alexander
* 11:45 – &quot;ITV News Live&quot; with Andrew Harvey (would include PMQs at 12.00pm on Wednesdays)
* 12:30 – &quot;ITV Lunchtime News&quot; with Nicholas Owen, simulcast live with ITV
* 13:00 – &quot;ITV News Live&quot; with Leyla Daybelge
* 14:00 – &quot;ITV News Live&quot; with Steve Scott 
* 15:00 – &quot;ITV News Live&quot; with Mark Austin and Mary Nightingale 
* 16:00 – &quot;ITV News Live&quot; with Steve Scott
* 17:30 – &quot;ITV News Live&quot; with Leyla Daybelge
* 18:30 – &quot;ITV Evening News&quot; with Mark Austin and Mary Nightingale, simulcast with ITV
* 19:00 – &quot;ITV News Live&quot; with Joyce Ohajah
* 20:00 – &quot;ITV News Live&quot; with Felicity Barr
* 21:00 – &quot;ITV News Live&quot; with Steve Scott
* 21:30 – &quot;ITV News Network&quot; with Steve Scott, broadcast from the &quot;London Tonight&quot; studio
* 22:00 – &quot;ITV News at Ten&quot; with Steve Scott, broadcast from the &quot;London Tonight&quot; studio
* 22:30 – &quot;ITV News at 10.30&quot; with Trevor McDonald, simulcast live with ITV
* 23:00 – &quot;ITV News Live&quot; with Joyce Ohajah
* 01:00 until 05:30 – Repeats of &quot;ITV News at Ten&quot; with live news summaries on the hour
On some weeknights they would simply rerun the 23:00 hour through the night with live summaries on the hour. On other weeknights they would have a live 30 minute newscast with in view sign language, which would then be repeated through the night with live summaries on the hour.

==Competition==
The channel&#x27;s main competitors were Sky News and BBC News 24.

At times of breaking UK news of importance to audiences in Australia, such as terrorist attacks, the channel was sometimes relayed by Australia&#x27;s Nine Network. However, the Nine Network usually preferred the Sky News feed, to which it had equal access.

<doc id="423052" wikidata="Q17055253" url="?curid=423052" title="1984 New Zealand general election">
<text>The 1984 New Zealand general election was a nationwide vote to determine the composition of the 41st New Zealand Parliament. It marked the beginning of the Fourth Labour Government, with David Lange&#x27;s Labour Party defeating the long-serving Prime Minister, Robert Muldoon, of the National Party. It was also the last election in which the Social Credit Party won seats as an independent entity. The election was also the only one in which the New Zealand Party, a protest party, played any substantial role.

A snap election, Muldoon called for it a month prior. When doing so he was both live on television and visibly drunk, leading to the election being dubbed the &quot;schnapps election&quot;.

==Background==
Before the election, the National Party governed with 47 seats, a small majority. The opposition Labour Party held 43 seats, and the Social Credit Party held two. Although National theoretically commanded a two-seat lead over the other parties, dissent within the National caucus (particularly by Marilyn Waring and Mike Minogue) resulted in serious problems for National leader Robert Muldoon. Muldoon felt that he could no longer maintain a majority until the end of the sitting year.

The 1984 election was called when Marilyn Waring told Muldoon that she would not support his government in the vote over an opposition-sponsored anti-nuclear bill. Muldoon, visibly drunk, announced a snap election on national television on the night of 14 June. It is believed that Muldoon&#x27;s behaviour was also the result of a number of personal factors, including, not least, tiredness and frustration, but alcohol and diabetes also, issues that had been plaguing him for some time. Muldoon&#x27;s drunkenness while making the announcement led to the election being nicknamed the &quot;schnapps election&quot;.

There is debate over whether the election was necessary — Waring had not threatened to block confidence and supply, meaning that the government could still have continued on even if it had lost the anti-nuclear vote. Nevertheless, Muldoon appears to have wanted an election to reinforce his mandate (just as Sidney Holland sought and won a mandate to oppose striking dock-workers with the 1951 snap election).

Muldoon&#x27;s government, which had been growing increasingly unpopular in its third term, was seen as rigid, inflexible, and increasingly unresponsive to public concerns. The Labour Party had actually gained a plurality of the vote in the previous two elections, but had narrowly missed out on getting a majority of the seats. Labour&#x27;s primary campaign message was one of change — Muldoon&#x27;s government, which employed wage and price controls in an attempt to &quot;guide&quot; the economy, was widely blamed for poor economic performance. Labour also campaigned to reduce government borrowing, and to enact nuclear-free policy.

The New Zealand Party, founded by property tycoon Bob Jones, was launched primarily to oppose the Muldoon government (although it did not support Labour). A right-wing liberal party, it promoted less government control over markets, in contrast to the paternalist and somewhat authoritarian policies of National, the other significant right-wing party.

===MPs retiring in 1984===
Seven National MPs and two Labour MPs intended to retire at the end of the 40th Parliament.

==Electoral changes==
The 1983 electoral redistribution was even more politically influenced than the previous one in 1977. The Labour Party believed it had been disadvantaged in 1977 and it was not to let this happen again. Every proposal was put to intense scrutiny, and this resulted in the electoral redistribution taking forty-one working days; the average length of the five previous redistributions was eight. As Social Credit had two MPs, the Labour Party nominee on the commission formally represented that party, which further increased tensions. The 1981 census had shown that the North Island had experienced further population growth, and three additional general seats were created, bringing the total number of electorates to 95. The South Island had, for the first time, experienced a population loss, but its number of general electorates was fixed at 25 since the 1967 electoral redistribution. More of the South Island population was moving to Christchurch, and two electorates were abolished ( and ), while two electorates were recreated ( and ). In the North Island, six electorates were newly created (, , , , , and ), three electorates were recreated (, , and ), and six electorates were abolished (, , , , , and ).

==The election==
The election was held on 14 July. There were 2,111,651 registered voters. Turnout was 93.7%, the highest turnout ever recorded in a New Zealand election. Most political scientists attribute the high turnout to a desire by voters for change.

Immediately after the election there was a constitutional crisis when Muldoon initially refused to follow the advice of the incoming Labour government and devalue the New Zealand Dollar.
==Summary of results==
The 1984 election saw the Labour Party win 56 of the 95 seats in parliament, a gain of 13. This was enough for it to hold an outright majority and form the fourth Labour government. The National Party won only 37 seats, a loss of ten. The New Zealand Party, despite winning 12.2% of the vote, failed to gain any seats at all. Social Credit managed to win two seats, the same number as it had held previously. The Values Party, an environmentalist group, gained fifth place, but no seats.

There were 95 seats being contested in the 1984 election, three more than in the previous parliament. All but two of these seats were won by one of the two major parties.

The Labour Party, previously in opposition, won 56 seats, an outright majority. Most of the seats won by Labour were in urban areas, following the party&#x27;s typical pattern. Exceptions to this general trend include the eastern tip of the North Island and the western coast of the South Island. Labour&#x27;s strongest regions were the Wellington area (where the party won every seat), as well as theWestern and Southern areas of Auckland where most of the poorest lived, Christchurch and Dunedin (cities in which it won most seats). Smaller cities such as Hamilton, Nelson, Napier, Hastings and Palmerston North were also won by Labour. As expected, Labour also won all four Māori seats, maintaining its traditional strength there.

The National Party, the incumbent government, was (as expected) strongest in rural areas. Most of the rural North Island was won by National, as were most of the rural areas on the South Island&#x27;s eastern coast. In the larger cities, the party fared poorly, with the Northern and the Eastern affluent areas of Auckland and the Western areas of Christchurch being the only places that the party won seats. It was more successful in smaller cities, however, winning Rotorua, Tauranga, Invercargill, New Plymouth and Whangarei. It was placed second in two Māori electorates, and third in the other two.

The only minor party to win electorates was the Social Credit Party, which won East Coast Bays and Pakuranga (both in Auckland). It had held East Coast Bays before the election, but won Pakuranga for the first time. It did not manage to retain Rangitikei, which it had also held before the election. Social Credit candidates were placed second in six electorates, including Rangitikei.

The New Zealand Party, despite gaining more votes than Social Credit, did not win any seats. Some commentators have suggested that the party was not seeking to do so, and instead was merely acting as a spoiler for National. This impression has been backed up by comments by Bob Jones himself. The party was, however, placed second in the electorates of Remuera (an affluent part of Auckland), Kaimai, and Tauranga.

The Values Party, an environmentalist group, managed to win 0.2% of the vote, substantially below previous efforts. The party, which was in slow decline, would eventually vanish, but its ideals and goals would be reborn in the Green Party.

In two of the Māori electorates, the Mana Motuhake party gained second place, but the party did not gain a substantial number of votes elsewhere.

No independent candidates won seats, but one independent candidate, Mel Courtney, was placed second in the electorate of Nelson.

===Summary of changes===
*Eleven new seats were created, of which seven (Christchurch North, Dunedin West, Glenfield, Otara, Panmure, Tongariro and West Auckland) were won by Labour, and four (Franklin, Raglan, Rodney and Waikaremoana) by National.
*A further ten seats were won by Labour from National: East Cape, Eden, Hamilton East, Hamilton West, Hawkes Bay, Horowhenua, Ohariu, Wairarapa and Waitaki. Social Credit lost Rangitikei to National. National also lost Pakuranga to Social Credit.
*Nine electorates had incumbent MPs retire and replaced them with MPs from the same party, six National and three Labour. Kaipara, Rangiora, Taranaki, Tauranga, Waikato and Waipa remained National, while Sydenham, Tasman and Yaldhurst remained Labour. In Rangiora, National MP Derek Quigley&#x27;s decision not to stand for re-election followed serious clashes with Muldoon over economic policy, while in Sydenham, John Kirk had resigned from the Labour Party.

<text>Gylippus (; was a Spartan general (strategos) of the 5th century BC; he was the son of Cleandridas, who was the adviser of King Pleistoanax and had been expelled from Sparta for accepting Athenian bribes in 446 BC and fled to Thurii, a pan-Hellenic colony then being founded in the instep of Italy with Athenian help and participation. His mother may have been a helot, which meant he was not a true Spartiate but a mothax, a man of inferior status. Despite this, from an early childhood he was trained for war in the traditional Spartan fashion and on reaching maturity had been elected to a military mess, his dues contributed by a wealthier Spartiate patron. For an individual of marginal origins, war was an opportunity to gain honor and eminence.

When Alcibiades urged the Spartans to send a general to lead the Syracusan resistance against the Athenian expedition, Gylippus was appointed (414 BC), his arrival was a turning point of the struggle. More daring than Nicias, the Athenian commander he faced, he was able to gain an upper hand by driving the Athenians from key strategic locations and essentially breaking the siege. When Athens sent Demosthenes with reinforcements, he too was defeated by Gylippus, which ultimately led to the downfall of the Athenian campaign in Syracuse.

Diodorus, probably following Timaeus, represents him as inducing the Syracusans to pass sentence of death on the captive Athenian generals, but there is also the statement of Philistus (Plutarch, Nicias, 28), a Syracusan who himself took part in the defence, and Thucydides (vii. 86), that he tried, though without success, to save their lives, wishing to take them to Sparta as a signal proof of his success.

Gylippus, like his father, met his downfall in a financial scandal; entrusted by Lysander with a treasure of silver coins for delivery to the ephors at Sparta, he could not resist the temptation to embezzle part of the shipment. Upon discovery of this theft, Gylippus fled Sparta and went into exile. He was condemned to death &quot;in absentia&quot; and disappears from historical records.

<doc id="423056" wikidata="Q49506" url="?curid=423056" title="Delta (rocket family)">
<text>The Delta rocket family was a versatile range of American rocket-powered expendable launch systems that provided space launch capability in the United States from 1960 to 2024. Japan also launched license-built derivatives (N-I, N-II, and H-I) from 1975 to 1992. More than 300 Delta rockets were launched with a 95% success rate. The series was phased out in favor of the Vulcan Centaur, with the Delta IV Heavy rocket&#x27;s last launch occurring on April 9, 2024.

== Origins ==

The original Delta rockets used a modified version of the PGM-17 Thor, the first ballistic missile deployed by the United States Air Force (USAF), as their first stage. The Thor had been designed in the mid-1950s to reach Moscow from bases in Britain or similar allied nations, and the first wholly successful Thor launch had occurred in September 1957. Subsequent satellite and space probe flights soon followed, using a Thor first stage with several different upper stages. The fourth upper-stage combination of the Thor was named the Thor &quot;Delta&quot;, reflecting the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet. Eventually the entire Thor–Delta launch vehicle came to be called simply &quot;Delta&quot;.

NASA intended Delta as &quot;an interim general-purpose vehicle&quot; to be &quot;used for communication, meteorological, and scientific satellites and lunar probes during 1960 and 1961&quot;. The plan was to replace Delta with other rocket designs when they came on-line. From this point onward, the launch vehicle family was split into civilian variants flown from Cape Canaveral, which bore the Delta name, and military variants flown from Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB), which used the more warlike Thor name. The Delta design emphasized reliability rather than performance by replacing components that had caused problems on earlier Thor flights; in particular, the trouble-prone inertial guidance package made by AC Spark Plug was replaced by a radio ground guidance system, which was mounted to the second stage instead of the first. NASA made the original Delta contract to the Douglas Aircraft Company in April 1959 for 12 vehicles of this design:
* Stage 1: Modified Thor IRBM with a Block I MB-3 engine group consisting of one Rocketdyne LR-79 main engine and two Rocketdyne LR-101 vernier thrusters for roll control, producing a total of thrust, including LOX/RP1 turbopump exhaust.
* Stage 2: Modified Able. Pressure-fed UDMH/nitric acid-powered Aerojet AJ-10-118 engine producing . This reliable engine cost US$4 million to build and is still flying in modified form today. Gas-jet attitude control system.
* Stage 3: Altair. A spin-stabilized (via a turntable on top of the Able) at 100 rpm by two solid rocket motors before separation. One ABL X-248 solid rocket motor provided of thrust for 28 seconds. The stage weighed and was largely constructed of wound fiberglass.

These vehicles would be able to place into a LEO or into GTO. Eleven of the twelve initial Delta flights were successful, and until 1968, no failures occurred in the first two minutes of launch. The high degree of success achieved by Delta stood in contrast to the endless parade of failures that dogged West Coast Thor launches. The total project development and launch cost came to US$43 million, US$3 million over budget. An order for 14 more vehicles was made before 1962.

=== Delta II (6000-series and 7000-series) ===
The Delta II series was developed after the 1986 &quot;Challenger&quot; accident and consisted of the Delta 6000-series and 7000-series, with two variants (Light and Heavy) of the latter.

The Delta 6000-series introduced the Extra Extended Long Tank first stage, which was longer, and the Castor 4A boosters. Six SRBs ignited at takeoff, and three ignited in the air.

The Delta 7000-series introduced the RS-27A main engine, which was modified for efficiency at high altitude at some cost to low-altitude performance, and the lighter and more powerful GEM-40 solid boosters from Hercules. The Delta II Med-Lite was a 7000-series with no third stage and fewer strap-ons (often three, sometimes four) that was usually used for small NASA missions. The Delta II Heavy was a Delta II 792X with the enlarged GEM-46 boosters from Delta III.

=== Delta III (8000-Series) ===
The Delta III 8000-series was a McDonnell Douglas / Boeing-developed program to keep pace with growing satellite masses:
* The two upper stages, with low-performance fuels, were replaced with a single cryogenic stage, improving performance and reducing recurring costs and pad labor. The engine was a single Pratt &amp; Whitney RL10, from the Centaur upper stage. The hydrogen fuel tank, 4 metres in diameter in orange insulation, is exposed; the narrower oxygen tank and engine are covered until stage ignition. Fuel tank contracted to Mitsubishi and produced using technologies from Japanese H-II launcher.
* To keep the stack short and resistant to crosswinds, the first-stage kerosene tank was widened and shortened, matching the upper-stage and fairing diameters.
* Nine enlarged GEM-46 solid boosters were attached. Three have thrust-vectoring nozzles.

Of the three Delta III flights, the first two were failures, and the third carried only a dummy (inert) payload.

=== Delta IV (9000-series) ===
As part of the Air Force&#x27;s Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program, McDonnell Douglas / Boeing proposed Delta IV. As the program name implied, many components and technologies were borrowed from existing launchers. Both Boeing and Lockheed Martin were contracted to produce their EELV designs. Delta IVs were produced in a new facility in Decatur, Alabama.

* The first stage changed to liquid hydrogen fuel. Tank technologies derived from Delta III upper stage, but widened to 5 metres.
* The kerosene engine replaced with Rocketdyne RS-68, the first new, large liquid-fueled rocket engine designed in the United States since the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) in the 1970s. Designed for low cost, it had lower chamber pressure and efficiency than the SSME, and a much simpler nozzle. Thrust chamber and upper nozzle was a channel-wall design, pioneered by Soviet engines. Lower nozzle was ablatively cooled.
* The second stage and fairing were taken from the Delta III in smaller (Delta IV Medium) models; widened to 5 metres in Medium+ and Heavy models.
* Medium+ models had two or four GEM 60, solid boosters.
* The plumbing was revised and electrical circuits eliminated need for a launch tower.

The first stage was referred to as a Common Booster Core (CBC); a Delta IV Heavy attached two extra CBCs as boosters.

== Launch reliability ==
From 1969 through 1978 (inclusive), Thor-Delta was NASA&#x27;s most used launcher, with 84 launch attempts. (Scout was the second-most used vehicle with 32 launches.) Satellites for other government agencies and foreign governments were also launched on a cost-reimbursable basis, totaling 63 satellites. Out of the 84 launch attempts there were 7 failures or partial failures, a 91.6% success rate.

The Delta was a launch success, but it has also been a significant contributor to orbital debris, as a variant used in the 1970s was prone to in-orbit explosions. Eight Delta second stages launched between 1973 and 1981 were involved in fragmentation events between 1973 and 1991 usually within the first 3 years after launch, but others have broken apart 10 or more years later. Studies determined that explosions were caused by propellant left after shutdown. The nature of the propellant and the thermal environment occupied by the derelict rockets made explosions inevitable. Depletion burns were started in 1981, and no fragmentation events for rockets launched after that have been identified. Deltas launched before the 1970s variant have had fragmentation events as long as 50 years after launch.

== Numbering system ==
In 1972, McDonnell Douglas introduced a four-digit numbering system to replace the letter-naming system. The new system could better accommodate the various changes and improvements to Delta rockets and avoided the problem of a rapidly depleting alphabet. The digits specified (1) the tank and main engine type, (2) number of solid rocket boosters, (3) second stage (letters in the following table refer to the engine), and (4) third stage:

This numbering system was to have been phased out in favor of a new system that was introduced in 2005. In practice, the new system was never used, as all but the Delta II have been retired:

== History ==
Prior to the launch of Channel 4 in 1982, the name &quot;ITV2&quot; had sometimes been used to refer informally to an envisioned second commercial network in the UK. However, the name resurfaced in the late 1990s for very different reasons. The launch of digital terrestrial television services in the UK saw each existing analogue terrestrial broadcaster given a slice of bandwidth with which to carry their existing service after the analogue switch off, with space left over for new channels. While strictly speaking this space belonged to each regional contractor for use within their own region, ITV had undergone a series of buyouts earlier in the decade; the three players operating the majority of the network, Granada, Carlton, and United News &amp; Media, jointly launched ITV2 in 1998 to be broadcast to most of the country as a uniform service. While free-to-air, it was marketed alongside their own subscription based ONdigital platform. Other ITV licensees, SMG, UTV and GMTV launched their own services in the space (see below).

ITV2 was announced in May 1998, and the channel&#x27;s original controller was Brian Barwick.

ITV2 launched at 7:00pm on 7 December 1998. The first programme was an hour-long introductory programme called &quot;It Takes Two&quot;, presented by Gabby Logan and Vinnie Jones. Billie Piper was heavily involved in the channel&#x27;s promotion at launch, with an updated version of the 1966 song It Takes Two sung by her used as the theme song for the launch programme and featured in the original promos for the channel.

While ITV2 is now an entertainment channel aimed to a younger audience, at its launch in 1998 it was a mixed genre channel and featured some programmes aimed at much older audiences than what the channel broadcasts currently. Despite this, the channel was launched to target a younger, more male audience.

Much of the original content in its launch schedule was current affairs related programming fronted by ITV newscasters. Katie Derham presented a weekly media analysis programme called &quot;Wide Angle&quot;, John Suchet fronted a weekly current affairs discussion programme called &quot;Who, What, Why&quot;, and Trevor McDonald presented an interview series, &quot;Trevor McDonald Meets...&quot;. These three programmes all ran on Sunday nights.

There were repeats of popular ITV programmes including &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;, &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;, &quot;A Touch of Frost&quot;, &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, &quot;Gladiators&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Try This at Home&quot;, &quot;Trisha&quot;, &quot;This Morning&quot;, &quot;Loose Women&quot; and &quot;My Wonderful Life&quot;, American acquisitions such as &quot;Judge Judy&quot;, &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;, &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;Maggie Winters&quot;, omnibus editions of ITV soaps &quot;Emmerdale,&quot; &quot;Coronation Street, The Bill&quot; and &quot;Home and Away&quot; and a Saturday football results service called &quot;Football First&quot;, which was promoted to ITV1 in 2001 (while maintaining an ITV2 slot) and rebranded as &quot;The Goal Rush&quot;. Other launch programmes included youth magazine show &quot;Bedrock&quot; and &quot;Soap Fever&quot; which taken a look at the UK&#x27;s major television soap operas. There was also live coverage of the &quot;UEFA Champions League&quot; among a range of other sports coverage Many of the older skewing drama series were dropped after the launch of ITV3 in 2004, and the launch of ITV4 the year later saw ITV2 ditch sports coverage, except on certain occasions as overspill.

In June 2004, ITV plc announced that they were going to double the channel&#x27;s programme budget and would add more American series and movies. On 1 November 2004, in an attempt to launch ITV3 on Sky, ITV2 moved from 175 to 118 on Sky after ITV plc bought GSkyB for £10 million. As a result, Plus was permanently closed down, with its EPG slot taken by ITV3.

On 10 October 2006, ITV announced the launch of a one-hour timeshift service of ITV2, ITV2+1. The channel launched on 30 October 2006 along with ITV3 +1.

In November 2006, ITV2 commissioned its first soap opera, &quot;Echo Beach&quot;. The series was to be interlinked with ITV1&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;Moving Wallpaper&quot;. In the end however, &quot;Echo Beach&quot; was broadcast on ITV1 instead of ITV2 as was originally planned.

ITV2 and its one-hour timeshift channel began broadcasting 24 hours a day on 17 March 2008. The hours formerly held by GMTV2 were moved to ITV4. GMTV2 programming moved from ITV2 to ITV4.
On 20 August 2008, ITV2 unveiled a new look. The logo was given a 3D look, with six new idents. The new look co-incided with a lineup of new programmes including &quot;Celebrity Juice&quot;, &quot;CelebAir&quot;, &quot;The Fashion Show&quot; and &quot;No Heroics&quot;.

ITV2 was launched on UPC Ireland in the Republic of Ireland on 4 January 2010, marking the first time the channel has been officially available in the country. The channel had already been (and remains) available to Irish viewers on free-to-air satellite for some time, however it is still not listed in the Sky electronic programme guide. On 1 April 2011, ITV2 was removed from UPC Ireland along with ITV3 and ITV4 due to the expiry of a carriage agreement between UPC and ITV. UPC Ireland claim that ITV is not in a position to renegotiate the deal because ITV had struck a deal with another channel provider to provide it with exclusive rights to air certain content from the channels. Conversely, UPC Ireland also claims to have been in discussions right up to the last moment to continue broadcasting the channels. ITV2, ITV3 and ITV4 were restored to the UPC Ireland line-up on 20 December 2011. Virgin Media One and its sister channel Virgin Media Two already hold carriage agreement to air certain ITV content within the Republic of Ireland, alternatively UTV is available within the Republic. ITV2 is available along with ITV3 and ITV4 within Switzerland, all three channels are available on SwisscomTV and UPC Cablecom. ITV2 is registered to broadcast within the European Union/EEA through ALIA in Luxembourg.

From 11 January 2011, ITV2 +1 on the Freeview platform has changed its broadcasting hours to until On 1 June 2011, an additional hour was added in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, allowing ITV2 +1 to start at On 2 August 2011, ITV2 +1 began to broadcast 24 hours a day on Freeview across the UK, using an eleventh stream created on mux A.

As part of the changes, ITV2 +1 swapped slots on Sky&#x27;s electronic programme guide with Men &amp; Motors, resulting in the timeshift channel making a significant jump from channel 184 to 131. It is now Sky 218.

ITV2 was made available on Freeview in the Channel Islands on 29 February 2012, a few months after ITV plc bought Channel Television from Yattendon Group plc.

In February 2014, ITV2 announced it was to focus more on entertainment programming, specifically drama and comedy panel shows - with reality and lifestyle, such as &quot;The Only Way is Essex&quot; shifted away from ITV2 to a new reality TV focused channel, ITVBe. This shift was not for long however as in 2015 the revival of &quot;Love Island&quot; premiered on ITV2, and has since became the channel&#x27;s flagship programme.

On 23 March 2015, it was announced that ITV2 had acquired the rights to broadcast US animated comedy &quot;Family Guy&quot;, which had previously been airing on competing youth channel BBC Three. At the same time, ITV also bought the rights to &quot;American Dad!&quot;, &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; and &quot;Bordertown&quot;. They began airing on ITV2 on 29 February 2016.

When sport was moved to ITV4, this meant no sports would air on ITV2. However, ITV4 was an evening only service and normally ITV2 would broadcast weekday daytime sports, including games from the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The weekend daytime sports coverage broadcast on ITV4. On 20 June 2016, ITV2 simulcast ITV&#x27;s coverage of a UEFA Euro 2016 match between England and Slovakia. In September 2020. ITV2 broadcast the British Touring Car Championship rather than ITV4 as the channel was broadcasting both the Tour De France and World Series of Darts, and ITV3 broadcast ITV Racing. It was repeated in 2021 for the UEFA Euro 2020 match between England and the Czech Republic.

In November 2021, the channel moved into the true crime genre with &quot;The Social Media Murders&quot;, a three-part documentary series with a different case examined every night, over three days. A second series debuted on ITVX in March 2023 with repeats on ITV1.

In March 2022, ITV announced that their new reality game show &quot;Loaded in Paradise&quot;, which sees teams in Greece trying to win a chance of spending the prize pot of 50,000 euros, and &quot;Tell Me Everything&quot;, a mental health themed drama series, would be two of the first ITV2 shows to debut on their new streaming service ITVX before getting terrestrial slots, which eventually came in April 2023 and June 2023 respectively.

In June 2022, ITV2 picked up a number of American drama series, primarily teen and family dramas from the late 1990s and 2000s, for daytimes including re-runs of &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, &quot;Hart of Dixie&quot; and &quot;The O.C.&quot; as well as the sports drama &quot;All American&quot;, which had replaced &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot; in its 7 pm timeslot. Subsequently ITV2 has also picked up &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; and &quot;Chuck&quot;. Later additions have included &quot;Charmed&quot; and &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;.

&quot;All American&quot; was unsuccessful in its 7pm slot and so after a month of consistently low ratings, it was moved to around 2am each morning, with &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot; returning on 4 July 2022. Despite this incident, in January 2023, ITV2 would later stop airing &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot; altogether and replace it with &quot;Superstore&quot;, a programme which ITV2 used to air until September 2022 when it was replaced by &quot;Secret Crush&quot;. After another three months of low ratings, this decision was eventually reversed, and &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot; returned to ITV2 for a second time in April 2023.

In August 2022, the channel axed its Katherine Ryan presented dating show &quot;Ready To Mingle&quot; after some episodes in the first series received ratings as low as 60,000 viewers, and picked up the rights to the &quot;Big Brother&quot; format, launching a teaser trailer for its return to British TV during the &quot;Love Island&quot; final.

On 19 September 2022, ITV2 and other ITV digital channels simulcast ITV&#x27;s coverage of the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey.

On 7 October 2022, the ITV2 Twitter and YouTube accounts were replaced by ITVX accounts in order to streamline the ITV channels for an upcoming rebrand. This came into place on 15 November 2022.
In March 2023, it was announced that ITV would be closing its children&#x27;s channel CITV after seventeen years (and forty years as a strand on ITV1) later in the year and moving its content to ITVX. In addition to this, it was also announced that children&#x27;s programmes would return to an early morning slot on ITV2. The block launched on 2 September 2023 following the CITV Channel&#x27;s closure and ran between 5:00 and 9:00 before being changed to 6:00 to 9:00 on 19 November 2023.

On 8 October 2023, &quot;Big Brother&quot; made its debut on ITV, with a special launch show simulcast on both ITV1 &amp; ITV2 watched by more than 2.5 million viewers.

==Most watched programmes==

The following is a list of the six most watched shows on ITV2, based on Live +28 data supplied by BARB up to 10 January 2019.

Before &quot;Love Island&quot;&#x27;s successful return, the highest rated show on the channel was episode 7.01 of &quot;Celebrity Juice&quot;, starring Phillip Schofield, on 9 February 2012.

== Awards ==
ITV2 won Channel of the Year at the Broadcast Digital Awards in 2007 and again in 2013. It was also named Non-Terrestrial Channel of the Year at the Edinburgh International Television Festival in 2007.

==Criticisms==
In a 2009 episode of &quot;Screenwipe&quot;, &quot;Black Mirror&quot; creator Charlie Brooker criticised the channel&#x27;s programming as being &quot;nihilistic worthlessness&quot; and called it &quot;a monument to cultural death&quot; and &quot;frighteningly meaningless.&quot;

In 2014, the channel was subject to a controversy about one of its shows. &quot;Dapper Laughs: On the Pull&quot; was created by Vine comedian Daniel &quot;Dapper Laughs&quot; O&#x27;Reilly. The show was criticised for promoting violence against women and dubbed by one paper as &quot;a rapist&#x27;s almanac&quot;. Due to these criticisms, an online petition for the show&#x27;s cancellation reaching 68,210 signatures and a sexist joke glorifying rape said by O&#x27;Reilly during one of his live shows, ITV chose not to commission a second series. A subsequent live tour was also cancelled. In the wake of the scandal, Stewart Lee criticised O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; apology and said &quot;what kind of person gets banned from ITV2? That&#x27;s like being banned from a pub that&#x27;s on fire.&quot;

In October 2024, in the midst of the Israel-Hamas war, an episode of the series &quot;Big Brother&quot; was edited by the channel to remove all images of a watermelon symbol, which has been used as a symbol of Palestinian solidarity, that appeared on the shirt of contestant Ali Bromley. Writing for &quot;The Intercept&quot;, Nikita Mazurov compared the action to George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, from which the series &quot;Big Brother&quot; takes its name, arguing that the editing of the episode represented a &quot;key tenant of the novel: old media being edited and original versions destroyed, leaving no trace of any modification having taken place.&quot;

==Subsidiary channels==
===ITV2 +1===
The timeshift channel ITV2 +1 launched 30 October 2006, along with its sister channel, ITV3 +1. It was allocated channel number 211 on Sky. On 6 May 2008 it was announced that ITV2 +1 would swap with Men &amp; Motors on the Sky EPG making a jump from 184 to 131. This channel is often unable to broadcast certain programmes &quot;for legal reasons&quot;, but the programme in question might still be listed on the EPG.
ITV2 +1 currently resides on Sky channel 218, and is also available on Freeview channel 29 Freesat channel 114 and Virgin TV channel 315. From 29 November 2023, ITV2+1 started going off air at 2am each night on Freeview. This was due to ITV clearing a Freeview slot, moving ITVBe+1, ITV3+1 and ITV4+1 to timeshare with ITV2+1. At 2am, ITVBe+1 takes over the bandwidth. ITV2+1 resumes its Freeview programming at 7am.

===ITV2 HD===
ITV2 HD, a high-definition simulcast of ITV2, launched on 7 October 2010 on Sky channel 225. The channel was initially available through Sky&#x27;s pay subscription service in a non-exclusive deal, before being added to Virgin Media&#x27;s service on 14 March 2013. Original HD programming includes entertainment shows, &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got More Talent&quot;, &quot;The Xtra Factor&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity: Extra Camp&quot;; original drama such as the third and fourth series of &quot;Secret Diary of a Call Girl&quot;; and acquired content including &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; and &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; and a range of movies.

On 1 November 2022, in the lead up to the launch of ITVX, the encryption was dropped on ITV2 HD at around 11am that day and so became free to air. Later that day, Freesat data had been added to ITV2 HD, indicating that the channel will be made available on Freesat soon. On 8 November 2022 the HD version replaced the SD version on Freesat channel 113.

== Former local variants ==

=== S2 ===
S2 was a television station broadcast throughout the Scottish and Grampian ITV regions by SMG plc, the holder of the Scottish and Grampian region ITV franchises. S2, which aired on the digital terrestrial platform, was launched 30 April 1999 and closed just over two years later – as part of a deal with ITV Digital – on 27 July 2001.

By the end of its life, it had lost nearly all of its Scottish programmes and mainly simulcast ITV2, but covered the ITV2 graphic with an opaque S2 graphic.

=== UTV2 ===
UTV2 was a television station broadcast by Ulster Television on Digital Terrestrial Television in Northern Ireland. It was launched in 1999 as TV You. The programming consisted primarily of simulcasts with the ITV2 station shown in England, Wales and the Scottish Borders, although they did also use archive broadcasts from UTV. UTV2 closed on 22 January 2002 following a deal with ITV Digital and was replaced by the national variant.

== Branding ==
When the channel launched, the logo was very similar in style to the ITV logo at the time and ITV were worried the channel looked just like an extension of ITV and did not offer anything new. It was soon after this that the channel received a complete overhaul along with the other ITV channels in 2006.

The channel received a new lime green logo, chosen as ITV thought it had a young fresh feel to it. The channel also received six new idents which all had names beginning with &quot;Too&quot; to relate to the 2 in the channel&#x27;s name. They were called; &quot;Too Fast&quot;, &quot;Too Hot&quot;, &quot;Too Cold, &quot;Too Expensive&quot;, &quot;Too Glamorous&quot; and &quot;Too Loud&quot;. Each of the idents were made up of a mix of shades of green to match the channel&#x27;s logo.

In 2008, the channel received another new look. The green logo was kept but edited. The channel now had a new 3D logo to try to make the channel look more modern and appealing to a younger audience.

During Newcastle United&#x27;s run in the 2004–05 UEFA Cup, the channel was rebranded as ITV Toon on matchdays, referring to the club&#x27;s nickname &quot;the Toon&quot;. The channel&#x27;s yellow and blue idents changed to black and white, to match the club&#x27;s colours.

In line with the corporate rebranding of ITV, ITV2 received a new look on 14 January 2013. The channel&#x27;s slogan became &quot;the home of infectious entertainment&quot;, and received a &quot;hot red&quot; version of the logo and red on-screen identity including new idents.

ITV2 presentation was given a refresh on 12 August 2015, with new branding, idents, the introduction of gif style bitesized promos, and a reboot of the channel&#x27;s social feeds, spanning YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram along with the launch of new ITV2 channels on Snapchat and Tumblr. As part of the refresh, the logo kept its previous state but was changed colour from hot red to turquoise.

ITV2 was given another rebrand on 15 November 2022, with new branding and idents along with the launch of the streaming service ITVX. As part of the refresh, the logo is now coloured pink and uses idents that are cross-used across ITV1, ITV3, ITV4, and ITVBe with different views which reflect the channel&#x27;s image and programming output.

<text>USS &quot;R-12&quot; (SS-89) was an &quot;R&quot;-class coastal and harbor defense submarine of the United States Navy.

==Construction==
&quot;R-12&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company of Quincy, Massachusetts, on 28 March 1918. She was launched on 15 August 1919, sponsored by Miss Helen Mack, and commissioned at Boston, Massachusetts, on 23 September 1919.

==History==
&quot;R-12&quot; remained at Boston, Massachusetts until she headed down the coast on 11 March to New London, Connecticut, whence she operated until the end of May. She then continued south to Panama; transited the Panama Canal at the end of June; arrived at San Pedro, Los Angeles, in July; and with the hull classification symbol &quot;SS-89&quot;, departed the California coast for Pearl Harbor at the end of August. Arriving on 6 September 1920, she remained in Hawaiian waters, with occasional exercises on the West Coast and off Johnston Island until 1930. On 10 May 1921 R-14 ran out of usable fuel and lost radio communications while searching for the ocean going tug, , which was lost as sea en route from Mare Island to Pearl Harbor. The crew stitched together blankets, hammocks and battery deck covers, and then spent 5 days under sail to travel 120 miles back to Hawaii. The CO received a letter of commendation for the crew&#x27;s innovative actions from his Submarine Division Commander, CDR Chester Nimitz. On 12 December 1930, &quot;R-12&quot; got underway for the East Coast and returned to New London, Connecticut, on 9 February 1931. She conducted exercises with Destroyer Squadrons of the Scouting Force into the spring, then following overhaul trained personnel assigned to the Submarine School. On 27 September 1932, she departed New London for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where, after decommissioning on 7 December, she joined other &quot;R&quot;-boats berthed there in the Reserve Fleet.

Some seven and a half years later, on 1 July 1940, &quot;R-12&quot; recommissioned in ordinary and shifted to New London to complete activation. Recommissioned in full on 16 October, she sailed for Panama on 10 December, arrived on 23 December, and into October 1941, patrolled the approaches to the Panama Canal. On 31 October, she returned to New London and for the next three months operated off the New England coast. In February 1942, she commenced patrols to the south and for the next year operated primarily from Guantanamo Bay and Key West, Florida. In March and April 1943, she was back at New London, then in May she returned to Key West, Florida, where she trained submariners for the remainder of her career.

===Accident and loss===
Shortly after noon on 12 June 1943, &quot;R-12&quot;, while underway to conduct a torpedo practice approach, sounded her last diving alarm. As she completed preparations to dive, the forward battery compartment began to flood. The collision alarm was sounded and a report was made that the forward battery compartment was flooding. Orders were given to blow main ballast, but the sea was faster. In about 15 seconds, &quot;R-12&quot; was lost. The commanding officer Lieutenant Commander Edward E. Shelby, one other officer, and three enlisted men were swept from the bridge as the boat sank and were rescued from the sea about six hours later by the submarine chaser USS &quot;SC-449&quot;. The subsequent 14-day search involved as many as 14 ships. Forty-two people died. &quot;R-12&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 6 July.

===Discovery===
Sometime before 25 May 2011, an exploration team led by Tim Taylor aboard the expedition vessel RV &quot;Tiburon&quot; located and documented the wreck of &quot;R-12&quot;. The reason for her loss remains unknown. In making the discovery, the team deployed a state-of-the-art autonomous underwater robot which collected first ever imagery of the remains of &quot;R-12&quot;. They are collaborating and sharing their findings with the US Navy. RV &quot;Tiburon&quot; intends to launch a future expedition to further investigate the possible causes of the sinking, and collect detailed archeological baseline data.
Updated information from the Department of the Navy shows the following:
On 12 June 1943, the &quot;R-12&quot; headed out from Key West to practice launching torpedoes. But as the boat prepared to dive, the forward battery compartment began to flood, and the sub sank in 15 seconds, according to a Navy Court of Inquiry.

<text>Season extension in agriculture is any method that allows a crop to be grown beyond its normal outdoor growing season and harvesting time frame, or the extra time thus achieved. To extend the growing season into the colder months, one can use unheated techniques such as floating row covers, low tunnels, caterpillar tunnels, or hoophouses. However, even if colder temperatures are mitigated, most crops will stop growing when the days become shorter than 10 hours, and resume after winter as the daylight increases above 10 hours. A hothouse — a greenhouse which is heated and illuminated — creates an environment where plants are fooled into thinking it is their normal growing season. Though this &quot;is&quot; a form of season extension for the grower, it is not the usual meaning of the term. 

Season extension can apply to other climates, where conditions other than cold and shortened period of sunlight end the growing year (e.g. a rainy season).

==Structures==

* Unheated greenhouses (also known as &quot;cold houses&quot;) offer protection from the weather, such as sub-optimal temperatures, freezing or drying winds, damaging wind gusts, frost, snow and ice. Unheated greenhouses can extend the growing season of cold hardy vegetables well into the fall and sometimes even through winter until spring. Sometimes supplementary heating is appropriate when temperatures &quot;inside&quot; the greenhouse drop below 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

* Passive heated or low-energy greenhouses: Using principles of passive solar building design and including thermal mass will help keep an otherwise unheated greenhouse several degrees warmer at night and on overcast days. Other systems such as ground-coupled heat exchangers, thermal chimneys, thermosiphons, or &quot;climate batteries&quot; can also be used to take ground-stored heat and use it to help heat a greenhouse.

* Polytunnels (hoop houses): Whereas a greenhouse has a frame and is glazed with glass or stiff polycarbonate sheets, polytunnels are built with thin polyethylene plastic sheeting stretched over curved frameworks, often extending as long &quot;tunnels&quot;. &quot;Low tunnels&quot; are short enough that a person cannot walk inside them, perhaps 2 to 4 feet tall, and the plastic must be lifted to access the plants. &quot;High tunnels&quot; are commercial-sized buildings, tall enough to walk through without bending and sometimes tall enough to operate tractors inside. Sometimes polytunnels are built with two layers of plastic sheeting and air blown in between them; this increases the insulation factor, but also cuts down on the amount of sunlight reaching the plants.

* Row covers are lightweight fabrics placed over plants to retain heat and can provide several degrees of frost protection. Row covers, being fabric, allow rain to permeate the material, and also allow plants to transpire without holding in the moisture (as happens under plastic sheeting). Row cover material can be laid directly onto the crop (&quot;floating row covers&quot;), or laid over a framework of hoops or wires. Row covers can be set up outside of any protective structure or placed over crops within high tunnels or greenhouses. In its simplest function, it allows a light frost to form on the cover instead of on the leaves beneath. Outside row covers must be clipped or pinned in place or weighted down on the edges. Inside row covers may be draped to the ground without further attachment.

* Cold frames are transparent-roofed enclosures, built low to the ground, used to protect plants from cold weather. Cold frames are found in home gardens and in vegetable farming. They are most often used for growing seedlings that are later transplanted into open ground. A typical cold frame has traditionally been a rectangle of framing lumber with an old window placed over it. Since the advent of plastic sheeting, it is often used instead of old windows. 

* Temporary coverings: In smaller gardens almost any type of cover, including glass cloches, newspaper cones, baskets, miscellaneous bits of plastic, and mulches such as hay, leaves, or straw can be used as frost-protection that is pulled on and off each day when frost is likely to occur overnight.

==Other methods==

* Hotbeds: a mass of hot compost is used for the heat it gives off to warm a nearby plant. Typically a few centimetres of soil are placed on top of the compost mass, and the plant grows there, above the rising heat.

* Mulches: many a material placed on the soil around plants will help retain heat. Organic mulches include straw, compost, etc. Synthetic mulches, typically, plastic sheeting with slits through which plants grow, is used extensively in large-scale vegetable growing. When the plastic is black, its color may absorb more solar heat, but if the plastic is clear, it may provide a greenhouse effect; both concepts are touted in discussions of mulching, usually without citations of any field trials that might clarify which to choose. Organic mulches, in addition to retaining heat by insulating, can potentially also add some heat from their decomposition, although they must be properly chosen, as factors such as thermal or chemical &quot;burning&quot; (excess heat, acidity, or both) and coliform bacteria accompany animal manure used as row-crop mulch. One principle involved is to prefer aged compost over fresh compost for this purpose, as its earlier predigestion by soil microbes ends the early phase of intense heat, low pH, and gut bacteria dominance but still leaves a bit more exothermic potential available. 

* Raised beds: beds where the soil has been loosened and piled a few inches to more than a foot above the surrounding area heat more quickly in spring, allowing earlier planting.

<doc id="423064" wikidata="Q1790796" url="?curid=423064" title="Madai">
<text>Madai (, ; , ) is a son of Japheth and one of the 16 grandsons of Noah in the &quot;Book of Genesis&quot; of the Hebrew Bible.

== Associated nations ==

=== Medes and related Iranian nations ===
Biblical scholars have generally identified Madai with the Iranian Medes of much later records. The Medes, reckoned to be his offspring by Josephus and most subsequent writers, were also known as &quot;Madai&quot;, including in both Assyrian and Hebrew sources.

Also linked with Madai is the Iranian city of Hamadan.

The Kurds, Balochs, Azeris (before Turkification) still maintain traditions of descent from Madai.

=== Others ===
Some scholars in more modern times have also proposed connections with various earlier nations, such as Mitanni, Matiene, and Mannai.

== In the Book of Jubilees ==
According to the &quot;Book of Jubilees&quot; (10:35-36), Madai had married a daughter of Shem, and preferred to live among Shem&#x27;s descendants, rather than dwell in his allotted inheritance beyond the Black Sea (seemingly corresponding to the British Isles), so he begged his brothers-in-law, Elam, Asshur and Arphaxad, until he finally received from them the land that was named after him, Media.

Another line in &quot;Jubilees&quot; (8:5) states that a daughter of Madai named Milcah (Aramaic: &quot;Melkâ&quot;) married Cainan, who is an ancestor of Abraham also mentioned in the Septuagint version of Genesis and in the Gospel of Luke (3:36).

== Purported link with Medos and Medea ==
&quot;Medos&quot; (), and his mother Medea, were also reckoned to be the ancestors of the Medes in classical Greek mythical history. Christian scholars have proposed linking Hebrew &quot;Madai&quot; and Greek &quot;Medos&quot; since at least the time of Isidore of Seville [&quot;Etym&quot; 9.2.28], ca. 600 AD.

<doc id="423074" wikidata="Q609077" url="?curid=423074" title="Orbiter (simulator)">
<text>Orbiter is a space flight simulator program developed to simulate spaceflight using realistic Newtonian physics. The simulator was released on 27 November 2000; the latest edition, labeled &quot;Orbiter 2024&quot;, was released on 31 December 2024. On 27 July 2021, its developer, Martin Schweiger, announced to the community that &quot;Orbiter&quot; is being published under open source MIT License.

&quot;Orbiter&quot; was developed by Martin Schweiger, a senior research fellow in the computer science department at University College London, who felt that space flight simulators at the time were lacking in realistic physics-based flight models, and decided to write a simulator that made learning physics concepts enjoyable. It has been used as a teaching aid in classrooms, and a community of add-on developers have created a multitude of add-ons to allow users to fly assorted real and fictional spacecraft and add new planets or planetary systems.

==About the simulator==

===Features===
&quot;Orbiter&quot; is a realistic physics simulator which allows users to explore the Solar System in a number of spacecraft, both realistic, such as the ; and fictional, such as the &quot;Delta-Glider.&quot; Schweiger has included fictional spacecraft to allow for easier flights for less experienced users. The simulator is realistic enough to re-enact historical space flights, and the ability to fly fictional ships also allows the player to reach areas of the Solar System that cannot be reached by human spaceflight at the present time.

A spacecraft&#x27;s engines are defined only by the amount of thrust they put out and amount of fuel they use, allowing anything from solar sails to conventional rocket engines to futuristic nuclear fission and fusion drives to be simulated. Everything between ground movement and interplanetary travel is supported, including orbital and sub-orbital flight, although only vessel-ground collisions are supported. Docking and attachment systems allow the user to simulate docking with a space station or other spacecraft, and rendezvous with and retrieval of satellites. Users can also build space stations in orbit.

The Solar System as presented in &quot;Orbiter&quot; consists of the Sun, the eight planets and their major moons. Many dwarf planets, asteroids (except Vesta), and comets not included in the simulator are available as add-ons. Although &quot;Orbiter&quot; contains a database of over 100,000 stars, these are for display purposes only and interstellar travel is currently not possible in the simulator. The simulator also includes a planetarium mode that allows ecliptic and celestial grids to be overlaid onto the star map, along with labels of the constellations and other celestial markers. The planetarium mode can also display labels indicating the location and identity of objects in the Solar System, such as planets, moons, or vessels, that appear within a certain proximity based on their type. This mode can also display labels on the celestial bodies in the Solar System at certain coordinates on their surface for indicating cities, historical markers, geological formations, and other interesting sites.

The traditional simulated control interface in &quot;Orbiter&quot; consists of two multi-function displays and a head-up display. Each features several modes of operation, with all commands given via the keyboard or mouse. The simulator also supports customized control panels and instruments, including 3-D virtual cockpits and 2-D instrument panels. These allow the player to use the mouse to interact with the panels, and allows more complex systems and instruments that are customized for each ship. The addition of a virtual cockpit also allows the player to freely look around from the perspective of the pilot. Since &quot;Orbiter 2006 Patch 1&quot;, it has supported TrackIR, which allows the simulator to track the head-movements of the player and adjust the view accordingly.

===Realism===
&quot;Orbiter&quot; was developed as a simulator, with accurately modeled planetary motion, gravitation effects (including non-spherical gravity), free space, atmospheric flight and orbital decay. The position of the planets in the solar system is calculated by the VSOP87 solution, while the Earth-Moon system is simulated by the ELP2000 model. Only n-body Newtonian mechanics are simulated, not taking relativistic effects into account. This means that phenomena such as time dilation due to relativistic effects are not simulated.

The default version of &quot;Orbiter&quot; before the 2024 edition had no sound, however popular add-ons called OrbiterSound and XRSound are available. Both of them provide engine noises, ambient sounds in the cabin, radio chatter and other sounds including playlists. Both of them contain options to maintain a realistic silence when the craft is viewed externally during spaceflight. There is no collision detection for objects in space, apart from defined docking ports. Since &quot;Orbiter 2024&quot;, XRSound is now included in the base package, but must be enabled in the launchpad options to function.

Since &quot;Orbiter 2016&quot;, terrain elevation is modeled for Earth, the Moon, and Mars. Support was also added for higher definition surface textures and clouds.

==Included spacecraft==
&quot;Orbiter&quot;&#x27;s standard distribution includes real and fictional spacecraft and space stations:

===Real vessels===
;: The &quot;Orbiter&quot; version of the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;, a retired Space Shuttle orbiter formerly operated by NASA, and the only player-controllable spacecraft based on a real world design that is included with the basic installation of &quot;Orbiter&quot;.
;Space Station &quot;Mir&quot;: &quot;Orbiter&quot;&#x27;s model of the historic Russian space station. Unlike its real counterpart, it was not deorbited and is placed in an orbit which is closer to the ecliptic plane. This was done initially to make &quot;Mir&quot; a good origin of interplanetary flights in earlier versions of &quot;Orbiter&quot;, when &quot;Orbiter&quot; also automatically refueled spacecraft on docking with a space station. Using the scenario editor, it&#x27;s still possible to refuel in-flight or start the simulation docked and with full tanks. However, it is possible to move Mir into the correct orbit.
;International Space Station:In a similar orbit as the real ISS and in a completed state, it shows modules which are no longer planned to be installed on the real ISS.
;Hubble Space Telescope (HST): A model of the real HST, it gets used together with &quot;Orbiter&quot;&#x27;s Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;.
;Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) Satellite: Like the Hubble Space Telescope, it&#x27;s one of the example payloads for &quot;Orbiter&quot;&#x27;s Space Shuttle.

===Fictional vessels===
;Delta-Glider (DG): A delta wing spaceplane, which is rather easy to fly and thus good for the first steps into &quot;Orbiter&quot;. A variant of the Delta-glider is also included, the Delta-Glider-S (DG-S), which trades some of the propellant capacity for a scramjet propulsion system, at the cost of requiring fuel from the main engine fuel tank. It&#x27;s possible to travel from Earth to Mars with the DG, making it possible to practice interplanetary missions. It is technically a single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane.
;Shuttle-A: A small space freighter, which can transport six large cargo containers with a total mass of . It does not have an aerodynamic hull so it is at home on the Moon and Mars. While it is possible to launch and land the spacecraft from Earth, particularly when empty, the lack of aerodynamic lift coupled with Earth&#x27;s high gravity and thick atmosphere make this a difficult and fuel-costly operation. Its cargo containers are however equipped with automatic parachutes. Using the parachutes, it&#x27;s possible to simulate a cargo run from a lunar base to Earth and back, dropping the cargo while still in the upper atmosphere. Its high inertia and inferior aerodynamics make it harder to fly in an atmosphere than the Delta-glider. 
;Shuttle-PB: A small personal spacecraft, with high agility and a futuristic performance. As its main purpose is to serve as simple SDK example for add-on developers, it lacks many complex details of other included ships in &quot;Orbiter&quot; like 2D or 3D cockpits or animations.
;Dragonfly: A complex crewed space tug for the construction of space stations. It simulates its various subsystems at a higher complexity than all other standard spacecraft in &quot;Orbiter&quot;, being a good example of the technical possibilities of &quot;Orbiter&quot;&#x27;s SDK. Its flight model is also within the possibilities of current technology, making it a so-called &quot;nearly realistic&quot; spacecraft.
;Luna-OB1: A fictional wheel shaped station in lunar orbit, inspired by Space Station V from the beginning of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. It consists of a wheel, attached to a central hub with two spokes. The wheel has a diameter of and is spinning at a frequency of one cycle per 36 seconds, providing its occupants with a centrifugal acceleration of .

;Carina: A small fictional science satellite, which is used as payload on &quot;Orbiter&quot;&#x27;s Space Shuttle. It is a completely inert payload currently. It is based on a proposed European re-entry capsule experiment, to be launched on the Ariane 4, which later resulted in the ARD.

==&quot;Orbiter&quot; add-ons==

An extensive API enables &quot;Orbiter&quot; users to contribute by creating add-ons. Many spacecraft are available for download as add-ons, ranging from the Soviet Vostok spacecraft to Apollo program. Another popular category of add-ons are modifications of the standard spacecraft of &quot;Orbiter&quot;, ranging from simple visual changes to complex simulations of the internal subsystems of these fictional crafts. Examples of these more advanced default spacecraft include the XR Series of vessels.

Add-ons are also available for new surface bases, MFD modes, extensions of the simulation menu, space stations, planets, and even other planetary systems. Since &quot;Orbiter 2006&quot;, a scenario editor is included, which can also be extended for supporting the special attributes of add-on vessels. A third party modlist installer by orbiter-mods.com called Orb can be used to automatically install mod bundles, though this tool has been noted to be largely ignorant of the addon licenses and terms of use, and is a point of contention within the community.

<doc id="423076" wikidata="Q871396" url="?curid=423076" title="Nontheism">
<text>Nontheism or non-theism is a range of both religious and non-religious attitudes characterized by the absence of espoused belief in the existence of God or gods. Nontheism has generally been used to describe apathy or silence towards the subject of gods and differs from atheism, or active disbelief in any gods. It has been used as an umbrella term for summarizing various distinct and even mutually exclusive positions, such as agnosticism, ignosticism, ietsism, skepticism, pantheism, pandeism, transtheism, atheism (strong or positive, implicit or explicit), and apatheism. It is in use in the fields of Christian apologetics and general liberal theology.

An early usage of the hyphenated term &quot;non-theism&quot; is attributed to George Holyoake in 1852. Within the scope of nontheistic agnosticism, philosopher Anthony Kenny distinguishes between agnostics who find the claim &quot;God exists&quot; uncertain and theological noncognitivists who consider all discussion of God to be meaningless. Some agnostics, however, are not nontheists but rather agnostic theists. Other related philosophical opinions about the existence of deities are ignosticism and skepticism. Because of the various definitions of the term &quot;God&quot;, a person could be an atheist in terms of certain conceptions of gods, while remaining agnostic in terms of others.

==Origin and definition==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (2007) does not have an entry for &quot;nontheism&quot; or &quot;non-theism&quot;, but it does have an entry for &quot;non-theist&quot;, defined as &quot;A person who is not a theist&quot;, and an entry for the adjectival &quot;non-theistic&quot;.

An early usage of the hyphenated &quot;non-theism&quot; is by George Holyoake in 1852, who introduces it because:
This passage is cited by James Buchanan in his 1857 &quot;Modern Atheism under its forms of Pantheism, Materialism, Secularism, Development, and Natural Laws&quot;, who however goes on to state:
Spelling without hyphen sees scattered use in the later 20th century, following Harvey Cox&#x27;s 1966 &quot;Secular City&quot;: &quot;Thus the hidden God or deus absconditus of biblical theology may be mistaken for the no-god-at-all of nontheism.&quot; Usage increased in the 1990s in contexts where association with the terms &quot;atheism&quot; or &quot;antitheism&quot; was unwanted. The 1998 &quot;Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics&quot; states, &quot;In the strict sense, all forms of nontheisms are naturalistic, including atheism, pantheism, deism, and agnosticism.&quot;

Pema Chödrön uses the term in the context of Buddhism:
==Nontheistic religions==

Nontheistic traditions of thought have played roles in Buddhism, Christianity, including Nontheist Quakers, Hinduism, Jainism, Taoism, Creativity, Dudeism, Raëlism, Humanistic Judaism, Laveyan Satanism, The Satanic Temple, Unitarian Universalism, and Ethical culture.

<text>The Veterans Committee is the popular name of various committees of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum that elect participants other than recently retired players.

Originally, it referenced the National Baseball Hall of Fame Committee to Consider Managers, Umpires, Executives and Long-Retired Players; a former voting committee of the Baseball Hall of Fame that provided an opportunity for Hall of Fame enshrinement to all individuals who are eligible for induction but ineligible for consideration by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA). The term &quot;Veterans Committee&quot; is taken from the body&#x27;s former official name: National Baseball Hall of Fame Committee on Baseball Veterans, which first met in 1953.

The committee structure and voting process has undergone multiple changes, most recently in April 2022. Currently, baseball players and non-players (managers, executives, and umpires) considered by the committee are classed into two timeframes, the Contemporary Baseball Era (1980–present) and the Classic Baseball Era (before 1980). Voting is conducted annually in December, with any elected persons inducted into the Hall of Fame the following calendar year. Balloting currently rotates on an annual basis for nominees selected from one of three groups: players of the Contemporary Baseball Era, non-players of the Contemporary Baseball Era, and all persons of the Classic Baseball Era.

==History==

The Veterans Committee can be traced back to 1939 when Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis formed the Old-Timers Committee to consider players from the 19th century for induction to the Hall of Fame. In 1939, the committee selected five players. In 1944, shortly after Landis&#x27; death, the committee voted him into the Hall via a special election. Landis was the 28th person inducted to the Hall—over the next several years, the committee added 23 more: 10 in 1945, 11 in 1946, and 2 in 1949.
In 1953, the Veterans Committee met for the first time under the name Committee on Baseball Veterans. In its first voting, the 11-member committee elected six players to the Hall. Starting in 1955, they would meet to elect up to two players in odd-numbered years. In 1959, Lee Allen succeeded Ernest Lanigan as Hall of Fame historian. According to Bill James, Paul Kerr (president of the Hall of Fame from 1961 to 1978) would generally convince the committee to select players that Allen suggested to him, until Allen&#x27;s death in 1969. In 1961, the Veterans Committee expanded from 11 to 12 members. In 1962, the Veterans Committee went back to annual elections to the Hall of Fame, with the continued mandate to elect up to two players a year. In 1971, the Veterans Committee made seven selections; partly in response to such a large class, the Veterans Committee was then limited to selecting two players and one non-player every year.

Frankie Frisch, a 1947 inductee to the Hall, was a major voice on the committee in the 1970s. Backed by former teammate and fellow Hall of Famer Bill Terry and sportswriters J. Roy Stockton and Fred Lieb, who had covered Frisch&#x27;s teams, he managed to get five of his teammates elected to the Hall by the committee between 1970 and 1973: Jesse Haines, Dave Bancroft, Chick Hafey, Ross Youngs, and George Kelly. Additionally, in the three years after his death, two more teammates (Jim Bottomley and Freddie Lindstrom) were elected. After Frisch died and Terry left the committee, elections were normalized.

After the 1977 election, the Veterans Committee was limited to two selections overall per year. In 1978, membership increased to 15 members; five Hall of Famers, five owners and executives, and five sportswriters. The members would meet in Florida during spring training to elect a player or two every year. The Veterans Committee mandate of up to two players was increased briefly from 1995 to 2001. In these years, the committee could elect one extra player from the Negro leagues and one from the 19th century in addition to the two regular players.

Starting in 1995, the Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to elect as many as two executives, managers, umpires, and older major league players—the categories considered in all its meetings since 1953. By a new arrangement it separately considered candidates from the Negro leagues and from the 19th century with authority to select one from each of those, via two special ballots. The older players eligible were those with ten major league seasons beginning 1946 or earlier; those who received at least 100 votes from the BBWAA in some election up to 1992; and those who received at least 60% support in some election beginning 1993. Players on Major League Baseball&#x27;s ineligible list could not be elected. The committee could elect up to four people each year.

During much of its existence, the Veterans Committee consisted of 15 members selected by the Hall of Fame for defined terms. A six-man subcommittee of this group met as a screening committee to determine who would be on the ballot. The committee met annually to consider candidates in four separate categories: players, managers, umpires, and executives. The Veterans Committee met privately, and its ballots and voting results were generally not revealed prior to 2003. From the mid-1970s until 2001, the top candidate in each category was elected to the Hall of Fame if he earned at least 75% of the committee&#x27;s votes.

The Board of Directors reformed the system radically with new rules enacted in August 2001. Formerly, 15 members were appointed to limited terms; the new Veterans Committee would comprise all living members of the Hall, plus recipients of the Spink and Frick awards to writers and broadcasters. In particular, the new members were 61 living Hall of Famers, 13 living recipients of the J. G. Taylor Spink Award, 13 living recipients of the Ford C. Frick Award, and three members of the previous committee with terms that had not yet expired. Elections for players retired more than 20 years would be held every other year and elections for (managers, umpires and executives) would be held every fourth year. The first cycle for both categories would be in 2002 and 2003 for induction in 2003.

==Revisions to the voting process==

===2001 revisions===

In 2001, the Hall of Fame radically changed the composition and election procedures for the Veterans Committee, which was revised to consist of:

*All living members of the Hall of Fame;
*All living recipients of the Ford C. Frick Award for baseball broadcasters;
*And all living recipients of the J. G. Taylor Spink Award for baseball writers.

All members of the former Veterans Committee remained active until the expiration of their terms. Only two were on the committee for the 2003 election, the first under the new election procedures. Only one of the former Veterans Committee members (John McHale) remained on the committee for the 2005 and 2007 elections, and his term expired immediately after the 2007 election.

The election procedures instituted in 2003 are listed below. The procedures were changed again in 2007. Rules, and portions thereof, that changed in 2007 are indicated in &quot;italics&quot;.
*Elections for players would now be held every two years, starting in 2003.
*&quot;Managers, umpires, and executives would be elected from a single composite ballot every four years, starting in 2003.&quot;
*The Historical Overview Committee, a ten-member panel appointed by the secretary-treasurer of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America, created an initial list of figures &quot;from whom both ballots would be created&quot;. At this point, the players&#x27; ballot consisted of &quot;200 players&quot;.
*Ballots were screened &quot;by two groups – a sixty-member panel drawn from the membership of the BBWAA&quot;, and a panel of six living Hall of Famers selected by the Hall of Fame Board. The Hall of Famer panel selected five players for the players&#x27; ballot&quot;, and the BBWAA panel selected twenty-five players for the players&#x27; ballot, as well as all candidates for the composite ballot.&quot;
*The selections of the Hall of Famer and BBWAA panels were then merged, creating a single players&#x27; ballot. Players chosen on both ballots appeared only once on this ballot, which now contained a &quot;minimum of twenty-five and a maximum of thirty players.&quot;
*The players&#x27; ballot and &quot;composite ballot (fifteen candidates)&quot; are made public before voting.
*Balloting is held by mail, with a stated deadline.
*The Veterans Committee vote is made public after voting.
*All candidates who receive 75% or more of the vote are elected; election is no longer restricted to only the top vote-getter.
*&quot;Every player with ten or more years of major-league experience who has not been active in the previous twenty years, and is not on Major League Baseball&#x27;s ineligible list, is eligible for Veterans Committee consideration.&quot; In the past, players who did not receive a certain percentage of the votes on a BBWAA ballot were permanently ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration.

Using these procedures, no one was elected to the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 2003, 2005, or 2007.

===2007 revisions===
Following the 2007 elections, the makeup of the committee was again changed, and several procedures were also modified:

;Changes affecting all elections
*The Historical Overview Committee will continue to formulate the players and managers/umpires ballots, but it will now present a players&#x27; ballot of only twenty players and a managers/umpires ballot of only ten figures. The executives ballot, consisting of ten individuals, will be formulated by the voting body for that ballot.

;Changes affecting player elections
*The players ballot is now restricted to players whose careers began in 1943 or later.
*Voting for the players ballot is now restricted to Hall of Fame members. Winners of the Frick and Spink Awards are considered &quot;honorees&quot; and are thus ineligible to vote on the main players ballot.
*The list of those eligible for the players ballot will be separately reviewed by a six-member panel of Hall of Famers, which will select five players for the ballot.
*Next, all living Hall of Famers are invited to a meeting at the Hall of Fame during induction weekend. The Hall of Famers who are present at this meeting will narrow the list to a final ballot of 10 players.
*The final players ballot is sent to all living Hall of Famers, who can vote for as many as four individuals.

;Pre-World War II players
*Players whose careers began before 1943 are now considered &quot;every five years&quot; by a committee of twelve Hall of Famers, writers, and baseball historians, to be chosen by the Hall of Fame Board. The first election of pre-World War II players was conducted in 2009.

;Changes affecting non-player elections
*The composite ballot will be split into two separate ballots, one for managers and umpires and the other for executives.
*Voting on the managers/umpires and executives ballots will now be conducted for induction in even-numbered years, starting with the class of 2008.
*The voting body for the managers/umpires ballot will be a sixteen-member body of Hall of Famers, executives, and media veterans appointed by the Hall of Fame Board.
*The voting body for the executives ballot will be a separate twelve-member body of Hall of Famers, executives, and media veterans appointed by the Hall of Fame Board.
*Each ballot is presented to the applicable voting board. As is the case for the players&#x27; ballot, each voter can choose as many as four individuals.

The threshold for induction remained at 75% of all who voted on the appropriate ballot. In the first election held under the new rules, two managers and three executives were elected in December 2007 as part of the 2008 election process.

===2010 revisions===
The Hall announced a new Veterans Committee voting process on June 26, 2010, effective with the 2011 election process that began late in 2010. The two biggest changes are:
* Managers, umpires, executives, and players will now be considered on a single ballot.
* Living Hall of Fame members will no longer constitute a single electoral body. Instead, separate 16-member subcommittees will be created to vote on individuals from different eras of baseball.

Candidates were classified by the time-periods that cover their greatest contributions:
* Pre-Integration Era (1871–1946)
* Golden Era (1947–1972)
* Expansion Era (1973 and later)

Candidates from each era were considered every third year, starting with the Expansion Era in the 2011 election (December 2010, 2013), followed by the Golden Era (December 2011, 2014) and then by the Pre-Integration Era (December 2012, 2015).

The existing Historical Overview Committee formulated each ballot for release in the October or November before the next planned induction ceremony. The Expansion Era ballot included 12 candidates, while the other two ballots included ten each. The Hall&#x27;s Board of Directors selected 16-member committees for each era, made up of Hall of Famers, executives, baseball historians, and media members. Each committee convened at the Winter Meetings in December to consider and vote on candidates from its assigned era. As before, the threshold of induction remained at 75% of those voting.

===2016 revisions===
On July 23, 2016, the Hall of Fame announced changes to the Era Committee system. Highlighting these changes was a restructuring of the time-frames to be considered, with a much greater emphasis on modern eras. Additionally, those major league players, managers, umpires and executives who excelled before 1950, as well Negro leagues stars, would still be afforded an opportunity to have their careers reviewed, but with less frequency.

Separate 16-member subcommittees were defined to vote on individuals from different eras of baseball, with candidates still being classified by the time-periods that covered their greatest contributions:
* Early Baseball (1871–1949)
* Golden Days (1950–1969)
* Modern Baseball (1970–1987)
* Today&#x27;s Game (1988–present)

The size of all committee ballots was set at 10 candidates. Whilst there was previously a one-year waiting period after elimination from annual BBWAA consideration, that waiting period was removed. The Today&#x27;s Game and Modern Baseball committees were scheduled to convene twice every five years, the Golden Days committee once every five years, and the Early Baseball committee once every 10 years.

While meetings take place in December, voting was included with the induction class for the following calendar year (e.g. December 2016 committee balloting was part of 2017 Hall of Fame elections and induction).

The induction ceremony originally scheduled for July 26, 2020, was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic; persons originally scheduled for induction in 2020 were inducted in 2021. Committee meetings originally scheduled for December 2020 (Golden Days and Early Baseball) were postponed for a year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Committee scheduling for 2022 and beyond is not presented here, as the structure of committees was further amended in April 2022.

The criteria for committee eligibility differed for players, managers, and executives:
* Players: Must be retired for at least 15 years. This means that no player will be eligible for committee consideration until a minimum of 10 years after he first becomes eligible to appear on the BBWAA ballot, regardless of whether or not he appears on a ballot.
** The Hall has not yet established a policy on the timing of eligibility for committee consideration for players who die while active or during the standard 5-year waiting period for BBWAA eligibility. In these instances, the standard waiting period for BBWAA eligibility of 5 years from retirement is shortened to 6 months from death.
* Managers and umpires: Must have at least 10 years of service in that role, and either be (1) retired for at least 5 years or (2) at least age 65 &quot;and&quot; retired for 6 months.
* Executives: Must be retired for at least 5 years, or be at least age 70. Executives who meet the age cutoff will be considered regardless of their positions in an organization or their currently active statuses. Previously, active executives 65 years or older were eligible for consideration.

===2022 revisions===
The Hall of Fame announced additional changes to its era committees on April 22, 2022, effective immediately. The multiple eras previously utilized were collapsed into just two eras: the Contemporary Baseball Era (1980–present) and the Classic Baseball Era (prior to 1980). An annual rotation of three ballots was also defined:
* Contemporary Baseball Era players: balloting in December 2022 for the class of 2023
* Contemporary Baseball Era non-players (managers, executives, and umpires): balloting in December 2023 for the class of 2024
* Classic Baseball Era: balloting in December 2024 for the class of 2025
The rotation will then continue every three years. A one-year waiting period beyond potential BBWAA eligibility (which had been abolished in 2016) was reintroduced, thus restricting the committee to considering players retired for at least 16 seasons.

The Baseball Hall of Fame officially named this group the &quot;Golden Era Committee&quot; (&quot;The Committee&quot;), which voted for the first time on December 5, 2011.

===2016===
The Pre-Integration ballot for election was released on October 5, 2015; final voting was conducted by the Pre-Integration Committee, a 16-member body which met at baseball&#x27;s winter meetings in Nashville on December 6, with 75% (12 of 16 votes) required for election; results were announced the following morning. The committee&#x27;s members, appointed by the Hall of Fame&#x27;s board of directors, were announced later in fall 2015 and included members of the Hall, baseball executives, members of the media and historians:

*Hall of Famers: Bert Blyleven, Bobby Cox, Pat Gillick and Phil Niekro

Blyleven, Gillick, Niekro, DeWitt, Hughes, Hirdt, Morris, Smith and T.R. Sullivan previously served on the committee which selected the 2013 inductees. For the second consecutive year, none of the candidates received enough votes for election; it marked the third consecutive year – and the fifth time in seven years – in which no former players were chosen by the Hall&#x27;s special committees. Speaking on MLB Network&#x27;s &quot;Hot Stove&quot; immediately after it broadcast the announcement, Major League Baseball&#x27;s official historian John Thorn expressed surprise and disappointment at the results, noting that he had felt there were three particularly strong candidates (prior to the announcement, he had commented favorably on the candidacies of Doc Adams and Harry Stovey); he speculated that the number of good candidates may have deadlocked the voting once again, and suggested that the Hall may need to amend the voting process in the future.

<text>Egham ( ) is a town in the Borough of Runnymede in Surrey, England, approximately west of central London. First settled in the Bronze Age, the town was under the control of Chertsey Abbey for much of the Middle Ages. In 1215, Magna Carta was sealed by King John at Runnymede, to the north of Egham, having been chosen for its proximity to the King&#x27;s residence at Windsor. Under the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the early 16th Century, the major, formerly ecclesiastical, manorial freehold interests in the town and various market revenues passed to the Crown.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, Egham became a stop on coaching routes between London and many places to the west. The importance of this shrank from the building of the Western and South Western Railways but was for many decades offset by the stark growth in the population of London and the country at large. Egham station was opened in 1856 on the line from Waterloo to Reading and services are operated today by South Western Railway. The town is west of the M25 motorway, accessible via junction 13.

The campus of Royal Holloway, University of London is to the west of Egham town centre, close to Englefield Green.

==History==

Egham predates 670 AD when Chertsey Abbey was founded; one of the earliest Chertsey charters mentions &quot;Egeham&quot;. The place-name means &quot;Ecga&#x27;s farm&quot;.

Egham appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Egeham&quot;. It was held by Chertsey Abbey and kept by that institution after the conquest when its assets were: 15 hides; 12 ploughlands, of meadow, together with woodland, &#x27;herbage and pannage&#x27; worth 75 hogs. It rendered one of the largest sums in Surrey to its feudal overlords per year, £30 10s 0d.

The village of Egham was, before 19th-century losses, an ancient parish raping land totalling in the counties of Berkshire (briefly) and Surrey; incorporating Egham, Egham Hill, Cooper&#x27;s Hill, Englefield Green, Virginia Water, Shrubs Hill, Runnymede, Egham Hythe, and a considerable portion of Windsor Great Park. In the medieval period it was divided into four roughly equal tythings:

*Hythe (which was on fairly similar boundaries to Egham Hythe)
*Town
*Strode (later also known as Stroude), but which now denotes a much smaller, and inconsistent area
*Englefield, which is partly Englefield Green, partly Virginia Water

The manor of Egham, which includes Runnymede, belonged formerly and in 1215 to Chertsey Abbey, and after the Dissolution of the Monasteries (around 1540) became the property of the Crown, though granted to various tenants (holders) at different times.

 Magna Carta was sealed at nearby Runnymede in 1215, and is commemorated by a memorial, built in 1957 by the American Bar Association, at the foot of Cooper&#x27;s Hill (a small rise adjacent to the Thames floodplain, immortalised in verse by poets including John Denham (&quot;Cooper&#x27;s Hill&quot;) and Alexander Pope (&quot;Windsor Forest&quot;)). A sculpture by artist David Parfitt portraying King John and Robert Fitzwalter in the act of sealing Magna Carta can be found in Church Road in the centre of town.

Another memorial at the top of the hill in nearby Englefield Green, the Air Forces Memorial commemorates Commonwealth air force personnel killed during the Second World War but who have no known grave. It was the first new-built British building to be listed in the post-war era. The memorial is administered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and freely open to the public year-round. It has excellent views towards London, Windsor and the Surrey Hills, as well as being a place of quiet contemplation and reflection.
Egham at one time held horse races which took place at the Runnymede meadow, which interfered with the Egham Inclosure Act 1814 and the consequent award made in 1817, which divided up the meadow, as the act stipulated that any enclosures which should interfere with the holding of Egham races at the end of August upon its usual course must be removed every year. In 1836 the races were presided over by William IV, who gave a plate to be run for at the meeting, which coincided with festivities at Windsor for his daughter&#x27;s marriage. The races ceased in 1884.

Other than two forming the hub of today&#x27;s Virginia Water (including Wentworth), the principal properties were &#x27;Egham Manor and Park&#x27;, &#x27;Egham Wick&#x27;, &#x27;Kenwolde Court&#x27;, &#x27;Markwood&#x27;, &#x27;Kingswood&#x27; and &#x27;Alderhurst&#x27; for a time home of Lord Thring.

Parts of Egham have featured in national and international news in the 21st century. On 12 September 2007 a case of foot-and-mouth disease was found in Egham, from the previous outbreak found in early August 2007. Occasional flooding of Runnymede and parts of Egham Hythe have taken place following exceptional Thames Valley winter rainfall. Units of the army were deployed to assist with defences and dealing with damage from flooding in the 2013-14 winter storms.

<text>USS &quot;S-4&quot; (SS-109) was an S-class submarine of the United States Navy. In 1927, she was sunk by being accidentally rammed by a United States Coast Guard destroyer with the loss of all hands but was raised and restored to service until stricken in 1936.

==Construction==
&quot;S-4&quot;″s keel was laid down on 4 December 1917 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 27 August 1919 sponsored by Mrs. Herbert S. Howard, and commissioned on 19 November 1919.

==Service==
Following acceptance trials, a visit to Havana, Cuba from 14 to 19 January 1920, and subsequent operations along the Gulf of Mexico and New England coasts, &quot;S-4&quot; departed New London, Connecticut on 18 November to rendezvous off New Hampshire with her assigned unit – Submarine Divisions 12 (SubDiv 12) – and SubDiv 18. The two divisions were about to embark on a historic voyage which, at that time, was to be the longest cruise undertaken by American submarines. Assigned to Submarine Flotilla 3 of the Asiatic Fleet at Cavite in the Philippine Islands, they sailed via the Panama Canal and Pearl Harbor and arrived at Cavite on 1 December 1921.

&quot;S-4&quot; operated out of the Cavite Naval Station, with occasional visits to Chinese ports, until late 1924, when the two divisions were reassigned to the West Coast of the United States. Departing Cavite on 29 October, they arrived at Mare Island, California on 30 December.

Remaining at Mare Island in 1925, she operated along the U.S. West Coast through 1926, mainly at San Francisco, San Pedro Submarine Base-San Pedro, and San Diego, California. She departed Mare Island on 10 February 1927 and sailed to the Panama Canal Zone, where she operated through March–April, then proceeded to New London, Connecticut, arriving on 3 May. For the remainder of the year, she operated off the New England coast.

==Sinking==
On 17 December 1927, while surfacing from a submerged run over the measured-mile off Provincetown, Massachusetts, she was accidentally rammed and sunk by the United States Coast Guard destroyer on Rum Patrol. The sinking was reported to be at a depth of located off Wood End Coast Guard Station, which was located near Wood End Light.

&quot;Paulding&quot; stopped and lowered lifeboats, but found only a small amount of oil and air bubbles. Rescue and salvage operations were commenced led by Rear Admiral Frank H. Brumby, Captain Ernest J. King, Lieutenant Henry Hartley and Commander Edward Ellsberg, only to be thwarted by severe weather. Significant effort was made to rescue six known survivors trapped in the forward torpedo room, who had exchanged a series of signals with the rescue force, by tapping on the hull. As the trapped men used the last of available oxygen in the sub, they sent a morse-coded message, &quot;Is there any hope?” The response, composed by Captain King was: &quot;There is hope. Everything possible is being done.&quot; Thwarted by the weather, the rescue force could not rescue the six men and all 40 men aboard were lost.

During the course of the rescue operation, Chief Gunner&#x27;s Mate Thomas Eadie rescued, at the risk of his own life, a fellow diver, Fred Michels, who became fouled in the wreckage while attempting to attach an air hose to &quot;S-4&quot;. For his heroism, Eadie was awarded the Medal of Honor.

&quot;S-4&quot; was raised on 17 March 1928, by a salvage effort commanded by Capt. King. Several of the salvage divers, including Eadie and previous Medal of Honor recipient Frank W. Crilley, were awarded the Navy Cross for their actions during the operation. Another Medal of Honor recipient, Chief Boatswain George Cregan, received the Navy Cross for his service as commander of the tugboat during the rescue attempt. The submarine was towed to the Boston Navy Yard for dry-docking and was decommissioned on 19 March 1928.

==Return==
&quot;S-4&quot; was recommissioned on 16 October 1928, after repairs and conversion to a test vessel for submarine rescue experimentation. She served at Key West, Florida early in 1929–1930, and in the Northeastern United States during the remainder of those years. In 1931, she operated again at New London until departing there on 3 January 1932 for Pearl Harbor. Sailing via the Panama Canal, she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 29 August. On 7 April 1933, &quot;S-4&quot; was decommissioned and laid up. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 January 1936 and scuttled on 15 May 1936.

<doc id="423085" wikidata="Q155879" url="?curid=423085" title="Diana Krall">
<text>Diana Jean Krall (born November 16, 1964) is a Canadian jazz pianist and singer known for her contralto vocals. She has sold more than 15 million albums worldwide, including over six million in the US. On December 11, 2009, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine named her the second greatest jazz artist of the decade (2000–2009), establishing her as one of the best-selling artists of her time.

Krall is the only jazz singer to have had eight albums debut at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Jazz Albums chart. To date, she has won two Grammy Awards and eight Juno Awards. She has also earned nine gold, three platinum, and seven multi-platinum albums.

==Early years==
Krall was born on November 16, 1964, in Nanaimo, British Columbia, the daughter of Adella A. (&quot;née&quot; Wende), an elementary school teacher, and Stephen James &quot;Jim&quot; Krall, an accountant. Krall&#x27;s only sibling, Michelle, is a former member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Krall&#x27;s father played piano at home, and her mother sang in a community choir. Krall began studying piano herself at the age of four and took exams through The Royal Conservatory of Music. 

In high school, she was a member of a student jazz group; at 15, she began playing professionally in local restaurants. Krall won a scholarship to attend the Berklee College of Music in Boston, where she studied from 1981 to 1983, before spending time in Los Angeles to play jazz. She returned to Canada to record her first album in 1992.

She met veteran bassist Ray Brown in the early 1980s. Impressed by her piano playing, he introduced Krall to other musicians and was an important mentor.

== Career ==

Krall recorded her first album, &quot;Stepping Out&quot;, for Justin Time Records in 1992; the album was released in 1993. She was accompanied by bassist John Clayton and drummer Jeff Hamilton. It caught the attention of producer Tommy LiPuma, who produced her second album, &quot;Only Trust Your Heart&quot; (1995).

Her third album, &quot;All for You: A Dedication to the Nat King Cole Trio&quot; (1996), was nominated for a Grammy and continued for 70 weeks in the &quot;Billboard&quot; jazz charts. &quot;Love Scenes&quot; (1997) quickly became a hit record with the trio of Krall, Russell Malone (guitar), and Christian McBride (bass).

In August 2000, Krall partnered with Tony Bennett for a 20-city tour, and in 2008–09 they worked together again for a song on the TV series &quot;&quot;

Orchestral arrangements by Johnny Mandel provided the background for her fifth studio album &quot;When I Look in Your Eyes&quot; (1999), her first released through Verve Records. The band mix was kept, following arrangements on &quot;The Look of Love&quot; (2001) created by Claus Ogerman; this record achieved platinum status and reached the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The title track from the album, a cover of the &quot;Casino Royale&quot; standard popularized in the late 1960s by Dusty Springfield and Sérgio Mendes, reached number 22 on the adult contemporary chart.

In September 2001, Krall began a world tour. Her concert at the Paris Olympia was recorded and released in 2002 as her first live record, &quot;Live in Paris&quot; (issued with a different European title, &quot;A Night In Paris&quot;). The album included covers of Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot; (a hit on U.S. smooth jazz radio) and Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;A Case of You&quot;, and was also released as a video album.

The 2001 movie &quot;The Score&quot; (US and Germany), starring [Robert De Niro]] and Marlon Brando, featured a recording of Krall&#x27;s entitled: &quot;I&#x27;ll Make It Up As I Go.&quot; This song accompanied the film&#x27;s ending credits (chapter 12) and was composed by fellow Canadian David Foster.

After marrying English singer-songwriter Elvis Costello in 2003, Krall worked with him as a lyricist and began to compose her own songs, resulting in the album &quot;The Girl in the Other Room&quot;. Released in April 2004, it quickly rose to the top five in the United Kingdom and made the Australian top 40 albums chart. She also joined Ray Charles on his &quot;Genius Loves Company&quot; album in 2004 for the song &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot;, and her 2004 performance at Bell Centre, Montreal on June 29 was released as her second live CD and DVD, &quot;Live at the Montreal Jazz Festival&quot;, released on November 23, 2004.

In late May 2007, Krall was featured in a Lexus advertisement campaign. That year she also sang &quot;Dream a Little Dream of Me&quot; with piano accompaniment by pianist Hank Jones for an &quot;all-star&quot; tribute album &quot;We All Love Ella: Celebrating the First Lady of Song&quot; (2007) produced by Phil Ramone.

&quot;Quiet Nights&quot;, produced by Krall and Tommy LiPuma, was released on March 31, 2009, and consisted of mainly bossa nova standards.

Krall produced Barbra Streisand&#x27;s album &quot;Love Is the Answer&quot;, released on September 29, 2009.

In 2011, Krall went on a private retreat to Sri Lanka. In September 2012, she accompanied Paul McCartney at Capitol Studios in a live performance of his album &quot;Kisses on the Bottom&quot;, which was shown live on the internet. On September 13, 2012, Krall performed &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot; at astronaut Neil Armstrong&#x27;s memorial service in Washington, D.C.

Her 11th studio album, &quot;Glad Rag Doll&quot;, produced by T Bone Burnett, was released on October 2, 2012, and covered mainly jazz tunes from the 1920s and 1930s. Her next, &quot;Wallflower&quot;, released on February 3, 2015, by Verve Records and produced by David Foster, tackled more recent composers including the Eagles (two songs), Elton John and Bernie Taupin (&quot;Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word&quot;), 10cc (&quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love&quot;), Neil Finn (&quot;Don&#x27;t Dream It&#x27;s Over&quot;), and Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan (&quot;Alone Again (Naturally)&quot;). The album&#x27;s title song is from Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Bootleg Series&quot;, and Paul McCartney gave her his blessing to include &quot;I&#x27;ll Take You Home Tonight&quot;, a previously unreleased original song he had written for his own &quot;Kisses on the Bottom&quot; album.

On May 5, 2017, Krall released her thirteenth album, &quot;Turn Up the Quiet&quot;, produced by Krall and Tommy LiPuma again. The album won a Juno Award as vocal jazz album of the year in 2018.

On September 14, 2018, a joint album between Krall and Tony Bennett, &quot;Love Is Here to Stay&quot;, was released. The album features the song &quot;Fascinating Rhythm&quot;, originally recorded by Bennett in 1949, which earned him a Guinness World Record for the &quot;longest time between the release of an original recording and a re-recording of the same single by the same artist&quot; — 68 years and 342 days.

September 2020 brought the release of her sixteenth studio album, &quot;This Dream of You&quot;, named after Krall&#x27;s rendition of the Bob Dylan song from his 2009 album &quot;Together Through Life&quot;. The album&#x27;s dozen tracks were selected from over 30 unused recordings previously laid down by Krall with her longtime producer Tommy LiPuma before his death in 2017. The album was completed in May 2020 with production finished by Krall herself, and included the jazz standard &quot;Autumn in New York&quot; for which a video was created to raise awareness for New York Cares, the largest volunteer organization in New York City founded in 1987.

Krall&#x27;s companions on her 2024 tour were Sebastian Steinberg and Matt Chamberlain.

==Personal life==

Krall and British musician Elvis Costello were married on December 6, 2003, at Elton John&#x27;s estate outside London. Their twin sons, Dexter Henry Lorcan and Frank Harlan James, were born December 6, 2006, in New York City.

Krall&#x27;s mother died of multiple myeloma in 2002, within months of the deaths of Krall&#x27;s mentors Ray Brown and Rosemary Clooney.

<text>The United Seventh-Day Brethren is a small sabbatarian Adventist body.

In 1947, several individuals and two independent congregations within the Church of God Adventist movement came together to form the &quot;United Seventh-Day Brethren&quot;. The organization was effected in order to increase fellowship and to combine their efforts in evangelism, publications, and other ministries.

The &quot;United Seventh-Day Brethren&quot; shares traits with other Church of God Adventist bodies, but is quite distinct from most other Christian groups known as Brethren. Their teachings include a belief in one God, and in the virgin birth, death, resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ. The Ten Commandments, including the seventh-day sabbath, are recognized as still in effect. The eating of clean meats and abstinence from unclean meats is observed according to the standards of the Old Testament &quot;Law of Moses&quot;. The widespread Christian belief in the immortality of the soul is rejected. Seventh-Day Brethren are premillennial in eschatology. Each local congregation is autonomous.

&quot;The Vision&quot; was once an official periodical of the &quot;United Seventh-Day Brethren&quot;. Now privately owned, it still reflects the beliefs of the church. In 1980, the &quot;General Association of United Seventh-Day Brethren&quot; consisted of four congregations, one each in Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma.

The Iowa congregation was located in Marion, Iowa with pastor W. Allen Bond. It was formed in the early 1960s and disbanded in the early 1980s

<text>S1909/A2840 is a bill that was passed by the New Jersey Legislature in December 2003, and signed into law by Governor James McGreevey on January 4, 2004, that permits human cloning for the purpose of developing and harvesting human stem cells. Specifically, it legalizes the process of cloning a human embryo, and implanting the clone into a womb, provided that the clone is then aborted and used for medical research. The legislation was sponsored by Senators Richard Codey (D-Essex) and Barbara Buono, and Assembly members Neil M. Cohen (D-Union), John F. McKeon, Mims Hackett (D-Essex), and Joan M. Quigley (D-Hudson). The enactment of this law will enable researchers to find cures for debilitating and deadly diseases.

==Views regarding the legislation==

Supporters of the legislation hailed it as promoting medical progress through science, giving hope for the development of treatments for debilitating diseases such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, cancer, and diabetes. Assemblyman Neil Cohen lauded it as &quot;not the most significant law we&#x27;ll write this session—but this century.&quot; Paralyzed actor Christopher Reeve, who believed that such legislation may hasten the development of methods to reverse paralysis, testified in support of the bill.

However, Congressmen Chris Smith, Mike Ferguson, and Scott Garrett assailed it, saying, &quot;This legislation will launch New Jersey blindly into the vanguard of terrible human-rights violations and grisly human experimentation.&quot; They also claim that, in practice, once a clone is developing in a womb, there is nothing that will prevent it from leading to &quot;the world&#x27;s first human clone being born and starting a horrible new era of human history.&quot; New Jersey&#x27;s Catholic bishops condemned the newly legalized process as violating &quot;a central tenet of all civilized codes on human experimentation beginning with the Nuremberg Code...[It approves] doing deadly harm to a member of the human species solely for the sake of potential benefit to others.&quot;

==Related policies around the world==

SCNT is currently legal for research purposes in the United Kingdom, having been incorporated into the 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act in 2001. Permission must be obtained from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority in order to perform or attempt SCNT.

In the United States, the practice remains legal, as it has not been addressed by federal law.

In 2005, the United Nations adopted a proposal submitted by Costa Rica, calling on member states to &quot;prohibit all forms of human cloning inasmuch as they are incompatible with human dignity and the protection of human life.&quot; This phrase may include SCNT, depending on interpretation.

The Council of Europe&#x27;s Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine and its Additional Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine, on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Being appear to ban SCNT. Of the council&#x27;s 45 member states, the convention has been signed by 31 and ratified by 18. The Additional Protocol has been signed by 29 member nations and ratified by 14.

<doc id="423092" wikidata="Q2718109" url="?curid=423092" title="Canadian–American Reciprocity Treaty">
<text>The Canadian–American Reciprocity Treaty of 1854, also known as the Elgin-Marcy Treaty (after its key negotiators, James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin and William L. Marcy), was a treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States that applied to British North America, including the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland Colony. The treaty covered raw materials; in effect from 1854 to 1866, it represented a move toward free trade and was opposed by protectionist elements in the United States.

After the American Civil War ended in 1865, US protectionist elements were joined by Americans angry at tacit support by Britain for the Confederate States during the war, and that alliance was successful in terminating the treaty in 1866. The response in much of British North America was to unite some of its colonies in 1867 into the new country of Canada. The new country expected to allow many new economic opportunities in Canada and to unify the colonies against the growing American expansionist sentiments, especially after the Alaska Purchase.

Attempts by the Liberal Party of Canada to revive free trade with an identically named treaty in 1911 led to a political victory for the protectionist Conservative Party, which warned that Canada would be annexed by the Americans. Talk of reciprocity ended for decades, and free trade did not return until the 1988 Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement.

==Origins==
Faced with the ending of British imperial preference when the British Corn Laws, tariffs on food imported to Britain, were repealed in 1846, the Canadian business community based in Montreal looked south. Merchants threatened to push for annexation to the United States unless London negotiated a free trade deal. In 1854, they achieved what they wanted by the Elgin–Marcy Treaty, which listed most Canadian raw materials and agricultural produce, especially timber and wheat, as goods to be admitted duty-free to the US market. The treaty ended the US 21% tariff on natural resource imports.

In exchange, the Americans were given fishing rights off the East Coast. The treaty also granted a few navigation rights to each other&#x27;s lakes and rivers.

The treaty represented an attempt by American manufacturers to enlarge their export market and to obtain cheaper raw materials and an attempt by free traders, tariff reformers, and their Democratic Party allies to lower the tariff. The protected interests, represented by the Republican Party, fought back and opposed the treaty.

==Effects==
Historians have agreed the impact was small for the United States but have debated its effects on Canada. After the treaty took effect, there was a large increase in Canada&#x27;s exports to the United States and a rapid growth of the Canadian economy, especially in southern Ontario and Nova Scotia. Canadian exports to the United States grew by 33% after the treaty, but American exports grew by only 7%. Within ten years, trade had doubled between the two countries. For nearly a century, Canadian economists saw the reciprocity era as a halcyon period for the Canadian economy.

In 1968, that optimistic view was challenged by the economic historians Lawrence H. Officer and Lawrence B. Smith. They argued that the growth of trade was caused by the introduction of railways to Canada and by the American Civil War, both of which led to huge demand in the United States.

They also argue the statistics to be questionable. Before the tariffs, much smuggling had taken place. Free trade brought the trade into the open, but the recorded increase in trade did not reflect actual growth in the economy.

In 1855, there were poor wheat harvests in the United States and Britain, and Russian wheat supplies were also cut off by the Crimean War. It was a great year for Canadian wheat, independently of the introduction of the tariff.

It was also argued that the treaty hurt Canadian manufacturing. For instance, the export of milk and barley hurt the Canadian cheese and beer trades. Some scholars like Officer and Smith hold that the economic prosperity that followed the treaty had little to do with tariffs.

The treaty stimulated the coal mining industry in Nova Scotia. The colony was already moving toward free trade before the treaty took effect, but the treaty still resulted in modest direct gains. The structure of the economy changed because markets for some commodities, such as coal, increased greatly, but the demand for other goods was unchanged. The treaty complemented the earlier movement toward free trade and stimulated the export of commodities that were sold primarily to the United States.

==Abrogation==
The treaty was abrogated by the Americans in 1866 for several reasons. Many felt that Canada was the only party of the treaty benefiting from it and objected to the protective Cayley–Galt Tariff, which was imposed by the Province of Canada on manufactured goods. Also, the Americans were angry at the British unofficial support for the Confederacy during the American Civil War: blockade runners carrying British arms supplies, Confederate Navy commerce raiders built from British shipyards (e.g., CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;), and British tolerance of Confederate Secret Service activities in its territories as an anti-U.S. base of military operations (such as James Dunwoody Bulloch, the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; Affair, the St. Albans Raid, and the Confederate Army of Manhattan) all in violation of British neutrality laws. These actions prolonged the Civil War by two years and inflicted a great amount of war cost and American lives (mostly from British blockade running).

The state of Maine, given its location, was a key player. Reciprocity benefited Portland&#x27;s trading position with respect to Montreal and the Canadian hinterland, but many Maine politicians and businessmen worked successfully to terminate the treaty. Many Americans were angry with Canadians&#x27; actions during the Civil War, like engaging in arms trafficking through blockade running for the South, and tolerating and even aiding Confederate activities such as the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; Affair, the St. Albans Raid, and the Confederate Army of Manhattan.

There was complacency on the part of Portland railroad interests, and the Bangor lumber interests opposed the continental economic integration that was envisaged by the treaty.

Canada attempted to negotiate a new reciprocity treaty, but the Americans were committed to high tariffs and would not agree. Starting in 1879, Canadian Prime Minister John A. Macdonald set up a Canadian system of tariffs, known as the National Policy.

==Aftermath==
From 1867 to 1911, the Liberals generally favoured reciprocity. After they won the 1896 election, however, their leader, Canadian Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, did not pursue free trade because the United States refused to discuss the issue. Instead, he implemented a Liberal version of the National Policy by maintaining high tariffs on goods from other countries that restricted Canadian goods. However, he lowered tariffs to the same level as countries that admitted Canadian goods. Political rhetoric made it a party issue. The Conservatives, which stood publicly for nationalism and protectionism (the National Policy), succeeded in associating the Liberals with free trade, commercial union, with the United States, and continentalism that would lead to annexation by the United States.

In 1911, Laurier&#x27;s Liberals successfully negotiated a reciprocity treaty, again called the &quot;Canadian–American Reciprocity Treaty&quot;, with US President William Howard Taft. In a speech before the US House of Representatives, Speaker Champ Clark spoke warmly of the treaty, saying it was a step towards the United States annexing Canada. The Conservatives made reciprocity the central issue of the 1911 election and ignited anti-American sentiment by dire warnings the treaty would turn the economy over to American control. The Liberals were decisively defeated in the 1911 election, and the treaty was rejected by the new Conservative government, led by Robert Borden.

After 1945, both nations joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and tariffs began to steadily decline. Free trade between the two nations was finalized by the 1988 Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement.

<text>Chrysalis Group was a UK media company that was founded by Chris Wright, chairman, and Terry Ellis. Wright was named in &quot;Sunday Times Rich List 2009&quot; of the 1,000 richest persons in the UK. Previously having interests in television, books and radio, Chrysalis now focuses on the areas of music publishing, music recording, artist management and entertainment product distribution. The music branch includes The Hit Label, Echo and Papillon Records.

The television arm was sold to All3Media in 2003. Chrysalis Records was sold to EMI in 1991, Chrysalis&#x27; song publishing was acquired by BMG Rights Management in September 2010. Universal Music Group absorbed most of EMI in 2012. The record label was then bought by the Warner Music Group. They in turn sold the Chrysalis Books Group to Anova Books, including the imprints Batsford and Robson Books, in 2005. On 25 June 2007 Chrysalis Radio was sold for £170 million to Global Radio.

Blue Raincoat Music bought most of Chrysalis from Warner Music in May 2016. In August 2019, Reservoir Media Management acquired Blue Raincoat.

<text>BBC London is the BBC English Region producing local radio, television, teletext and online services in London and parts of the surrounding area. Its output includes the daily &quot;BBC London&quot; news bulletin and weekly &quot;Sunday Politics&quot; on television, the BBC Radio London radio station and local coverage of the London area on BBC Online and BBC Red Button. The region&#x27;s headquarters are situated in the new eastern extension of the BBC&#x27;s Broadcasting House.

==Services==
===Television===

The staple of the local television service is BBC London bulletin which broadcasts daily on BBC One, appearing with short bulletins during &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot;, after the &quot;BBC News at One&quot;, the &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot; and &quot;BBC Weekend News&quot;. The flagship programme is broadcast between 18:30 and 19:00 each weekday evening, following the end of the &quot;BBC News at Six&quot; and is presented by Riz Lateef. Comparisons are inevitably made to the commercial TV regional competition, in this case &quot;ITV News London&quot;, which is produced for ITV by ITN. BBC London can be viewed in any part of the UK (and Europe) on digital satellite channel 954 on the BBC UK regional TV on satellite service.

BBC London also produces current affairs, features and sports programming for the region including the topical magazine series &quot;Inside Out&quot;, a 20-minute opt-out during &quot;Sunday Politics&quot;.

===Radio===

BBC Radio London combines speech and music based programmes 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Broadcasting across London on 94.9 FM, DAB, Virgin Media Channel 930, Sky Channel 0152 (in London area only), Freeview Channel 721 and also online. The station was previously known as &quot;BBC London Live&quot;, &quot;GLR&quot; (Greater London Radio) and &quot;BBC London 94.9&quot;. 

The current Breakfast show presenters are Penny Smith and Paul Ross and the mid morning phone-in show is presented by Vanessa Feltz. The Breakfast and Drivetime shows feature a wealth of local London news and comment with roving reporters out and about. Other programmes such as JoAnne Good or Robert Elms include varied speech and music with local news bulletins every half-hour. 

News bulletins on BBC Radio London at the top of the hour are traditionally longer than other BBC radio services at 5 minutes to fit in international, national and local stories with local sport and weather. In addition to the News service, a dedicated travel news service is operated by BBC London on TV, Radio and Online using information supplied by Transport for London, National Rail and National Highways. The travel news on BBC Radio London is updated at 31 and 58 minutes past each hour during off peak times, and every 15 minutes, starting at the top of the hour, during evening and morning peaks. It is one of the few radio stations to have access to TfL traffic cameras.

Sport is a major part of the radio schedule, with a three-hour sports based programme each weeknight evening and four-hour sport specials on Saturdays and Sundays. This is more than most other BBC local radio stations and reflects London&#x27;s large number of sporting teams and events.

==History==
The bulletin launched on 1 October 2001 following changes to the coverage areas of BBC transmitters allowing for the establishment of new editorial areas. The main result was a reorganisation of the BBC&#x27;s South East region; the London area was to break away entirely, while a new programme, &quot;South East Today&quot; was to be created for the new South East region. BBC London, as it came to be called, replaced the long-running &quot;Newsroom South East&quot;. 

Greater London and its environs have had a regional BBC television news service for many decades, but the boundaries of the region have always been somewhat nebulous due to the coverage areas of the transmitters used, as television signals do not tend to stick neatly to administrative or historical boundaries. Therefore, while the main focus of &quot;regional&quot; news coverage for this area has always been on the capital itself, it has for much of the BBC&#x27;s life had to offer coverage of other parts of the Home Counties as well. 

There were many incarnations of regional news programmes in this area before the current programme was introduced in 2001. These included the London segment of the &quot;Nationwide&quot; from Lime Grove Studios; in this case, the regional presenters for London were also usually the main presenters of the national sequence of the programme which followed. Other identities for the London area coverage were &quot;London Plus&quot;, and finally &quot;Newsroom South East&quot;. 

Originally, the BBC London and the South East region took in the whole of Greater London, together with parts of Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent, Surrey, Hampshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Sussex, Bedfordshire and Oxfordshire. This meant that sizeable communities which probably deserved dedicated programming of their own – such as Oxford, Luton, Crawley and Medway – were often ill-served by a London-biased programme. 

The area created for the BBC London programme to broadcast to now covers a much more tightly-defined area, chiefly Greater London but still including parts of Bedfordshire, Essex, and Hertfordshire in the East of England region and parts of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire, Kent, Oxfordshire, Surrey and West Sussex in the South East England region. There is also some overlap with the editorial areas of other BBC regions in this part of England. 

Oxfordshire (excluding Henley-on-Thames), most of Buckinghamshire, north Berkshire, north east Wiltshire, south east Gloucestershire and south west Northamptonshire, took an opt-out of South Today for some years before coming to an end on financial grounds in 2022. Most of Kent and East Sussex continues to be covered by the BBC South East region based in Tunbridge Wells, which produces &quot;South East Today&quot;.

==Studios==

The previous news services for the area, in the old BBC South East region, were variously based in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, White City and Elstree in Hertfordshire. Following the launch of BBC London, the region moved into facilities in Marylebone High Street, where the news service was based alongside BBC London News and the BBC&#x27;s Governance Unit. 

The arrangement was only a temporary one, as at the time the BBC was trying to consolidate its London portfolio into a few properties. This included, most notably, the planned closure of BBC Television Centre and the extension and renovation of Broadcasting House, stage one of which would construct a huge wing, mirroring Broadcasting House in shape, size and structure named Egton Wing. The wing has recently been renamed the Peel Wing after John Peel and is the home of a number of BBC services including BBC London, who moved there in 2009 following the structure&#x27;s completion and fitting.

<text>Classic FM (styled as CLASSIC M) is one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s three Independent National Radio stations and is owned and operated by Global Media &amp; Entertainment (Global). The station broadcasts classical music and was launched in 1992.

Classic FM was the first national classical music station to launch since the opening of BBC Radio 3 25 years earlier on 30 September 1967, and 46 years since the opening of Radio 3&#x27;s predecessor of The Third Programme on 29 September 1946.

, the station has a weekly audience of 4.4 million listeners, according to RAJAR.

==Overview==
Classic FM broadcasts nationally on FM, DAB+, Freeview, satellite and cable television and is available internationally by streaming audio over the internet. It is the only Independent National Radio station to broadcast on FM alongside BBC Radios 1, 2, 3 and 4. In addition to playing a wide repertoire of traditional classical music, the station also features more modern orchestral pieces such as film scores, television theme music and video game music.

==History==

The idea for a national, commercial FM network devoted to classical music originated with the management at GWR Group, an entrepreneurial group of UK commercial radio stations. It had been operating a trial programme on its AM frequencies in Wiltshire and Bristol, testing audience reaction to a regular drive-time programme of popular classical music. It proved successful, and the company&#x27;s CEO, Ralph Bernard, and programme director, Michael Bukht, drew up the plans for a national station.

Meanwhile, Brian Brolly, formerly the CEO of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s Really Useful Group, had a similar idea in 1990. After failing to raise sufficient funds for the project, Brolly&#x27;s consortium was approached by the GWR Group, and the two merged. The UK Government had decided to award several new national radio licences, and invited tenders. Brolly had brought the idea to Rick Senat, the long-serving head of business affairs in London for Warner Bros. and current owner of Hammer Films. Initially rejected by Warner Bros., Senat showed the project to the President of Time Warner International Broadcasting, Tom McGrath, a former classical musician and conductor. Time Warner agreed to back the project, but was prohibited under UK law of that time from owning more than a 25% interest.

The Radio Authority had granted an exemption so that Time Warner could hold more than 25%, provided a UK citizen/corporation was larger in the shareholding group.

The station launched at 06:00 on Monday 7 September 1992, after two months of test transmissions using a recording of birdsong. Nick Bailey presented the first programme, and &quot;Zadok the Priest&quot; by George Frideric Handel was the first piece to be played. Other launch presenters included Henry Kelly, Susannah Simons, Petroc Trelawny and Adrian Love.

Global, the UK&#x27;s largest radio station ownership group, now owns the station. Classic FM has broadcast from its current studios, on the second floor of 30 Leicester Square in central London, since March 2006. The first programme to be broadcast live from there was Mark Griffiths&#x27; programme on 26 March 2006.

In April and May 2017, &quot;High Score&quot;, the first series on UK radio dedicated to video game music, was first broadcast on Classic FM. According to the station&#x27;s website, it became &quot;the most popular programme on &#x27;Listen Again&#x27; in Classic FM&#x27;s 25-year history&quot;. It was presented by composer Jessica Curry.

On 2 January 2024, Classic FM switched from being broadcast in 128 kbps stereo DAB to being broadcast in 64 kbps stereo DAB+.

=== Spin Off Stations ===
On 10 September 2024, it was announced that Classic FM would, for the first time, receive spin-off stations. The names of the two stations were then revealed on 11 September 2024, after a two week long social media campaign by Global. The stations – Classic FM Calm and Classic FM Movies - launched the following day.

==Shows==
===Hall of Fame===
Classic FM&#x27;s &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; is broadcast annually over the four days of the Easter weekend. First broadcast in 1996, the show counts down the 300 most-popular pieces as voted for by listeners, culminating in the number one on the evening of Easter Monday.

The number one spot was occupied until 2001 by Max Bruch&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 1, and then by Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2. In 2006 the top spot was taken by Mozart&#x27;s Clarinet Concerto. From 2007 to 2010, the top place on the Hall of Fame was taken by Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;The Lark Ascending&quot;. The 2011 &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; saw Rachmaninov&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2 return to the top spot, ending Vaughan Williams&#x27; four-year run, and held the position again in 2012 and 2013. In 2014 The Lark Ascending replaced Rachmaninov, which slipped back to number 2 and remained number 1 through to 2017.

In 2018, the top spot was taken by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s 1812 Overture, Rachmaninov&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2 was a non-mover in second place, and Vaughan Williams&#x27; &quot;The Lark Ascending&quot; descended to third place after a four-year run at no. 1.

In the 2019 Hall of Fame, Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;The Lark Ascending&quot; reclaimed the top spot, followed by Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2 and Edward Elgar&#x27;s Enigma Variations at second and third respectively. 2020 and 2021&#x27;s Hall Of Fame also saw &quot;The Lark Ascending&quot; voted the most popular piece by Classic FM listeners.

===Nation&#x27;s Favourite Christmas Carol===
Classic FM broadcasts the &quot;Nation&#x27;s Favourite Christmas Carol&quot; in a similar format to the &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;. The show counts down the thirty most popular Christmas carols every Christmas Day between 13:00 and 15:00, as voted for by listeners. It began in 2001, with &quot;In the Bleak Midwinter&quot; winning the first vote. The following year, &quot;Silent Night&quot; was voted the nation&#x27;s favourite. The vote has been won by &quot;O Holy Night&quot; in almost every year since then, with the only other winner being &quot;Silent Night&quot; in 2014 and 2015.

===Classic FM chart===
From the station&#x27;s launch in September 1992 until the end of 2019, Classic FM broadcast a weekly classical chart show. Initially transmitted on Saturday mornings, the programme later moved to Sunday evening. The final chart show was aired on 21 December 2019.

=== Playlist ===
At the heart of Classic FM&#x27;s identity from the start was its playlist of popular classics. It was compiled over the first few years by Robin Ray, who drew up a list of more than 50,000 classical music pieces and rated them for popular appeal, which forms the basis for the Classic FM playlist. Selector software developed by RCS Inc in the United States, which had previously been used only for pop music, was adapted for classical music by Howard, Ray and others to include many more fields and categories, and deal with many more rotation rules to create a playlist from the 50,000 listed tracks; the first &quot;officially broadcast&quot; track was &quot;Zadok the Priest&quot;.

==Composer in residence==
Classic FM named a composer in residence in 2004, Joby Talbot. Talbot composed a piece, scored for up to five instruments, each month for the year of his residence. The compositions were also premiered on Classic FM. The twelve compositions form part of a larger piece, released on a CD entitled &quot;Once Around the Sun&quot; on 23 May 2005.

Talbot was succeeded by Patrick Hawes as the new composer in residence in 2006 and composed the piano album &quot;Towards the Light&quot; during his residency. In May 2008 Howard Goodall, the composer and television presenter, joined Classic FM as the station&#x27;s latest composer in residence. Goodall also presented a new programme on the station, &quot;Howard Goodall on...&quot;, beginning on 7 June 2008.

Debbie Wiseman was named composer in residence in 2015. Her first album commissioned for Classic FM was &quot;The Musical Zodiac&quot;, which was released the following year.

==Sponsorship==
Classic FM were sponsors of Queens Park Rangers Football Club between 1992 and 1994.

<text>Indian Village is a neighborhood located in Detroit, Michigan, bounded to the north and south by Mack Avenue and East Jefferson Avenue, respectively, along the streets of Burns, Iroquois, and Seminole. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

==Overview==
The district has a number of architecturally-significant homes built in the early 20th century. Some of the houses have been substantially restored, and many others are well kept up. Bordering Indian Village to the west is West Village, with additional historic homes, townhouses and apartments.

Many of the homes were designed by prominent architects, such as Albert Kahn, Louis Kamper and William B. Stratton, for some of the area&#x27;s most prominent citizens, such as Edsel Ford. A lot of homes are very large, with some over 12,000 square feet (1,100 m2). Many have a carriage house, with some of those being larger than an average suburban home. Some of the houses also have large amounts of Pewabic Pottery tiles.

Indian Village has very active community organizations, including the Indian Village Association, Men&#x27;s Garden Club and Women&#x27;s Garden Club. The neighborhood hosts an annual Home &amp; Garden Tour on the first Saturday in June, neighborhood yard sales in September, a holiday home tour in December, and many other community events. The neighborhood contains many historic homes including that of automotive entrepreneur Henry Leland, founder of Lincoln and Cadillac, who resided at 1052 Seminole St. With a white population of 63 percent Indian Village is one of Detroit&#x27;s few white majority neighborhoods.

==Schools==
Detroit Public Schools operates the area&#x27;s public schools.

Residents are zoned to Nichols Elementary School, Marcus Garvey African Centered Academy K-8 for middle school, and Southeastern High School. On previous occasions, Butzel Middle School served Indian Village.

Private schools serving Indian Village include the Benjamin E. Mays Male Academy, the Detroit Waldorf School and Detroit Friends School. Cornerstone Schools formerly operated the K-5 Iroquois Campus in Indian Village.

<doc id="423114" wikidata="Q2026177" url="?curid=423114" title="Operation Loyton">
<text>Operation Loyton was the codename given to a Special Air Service (SAS) mission in the Vosges department of France during the Second World War.

The mission, between 12 August and 9 October 1944, had the misfortune to be parachuted into the Vosges Mountains, at a time when the German Army was reinforcing the area, against General George Patton&#x27;s Third Army. As a result, the Germans quickly became aware of their presence and conducted operations to destroy the SAS team.

With their supplies running out and under pressure from the German army, the SAS were ordered to form smaller groups to return to Allied lines. During the fighting and breakout operations 31 men were captured and later executed by the Germans.

==Background==
The Vosges is a region in north-eastern France close to the German border. In 1944 it was sparsely populated and consisted of wooded hills, valley pastures and small isolated villages, an ideal area for a small mobile raiding force to operate. In late 1944 it was also the area that General George Patton&#x27;s Third Army was heading towards, but outrunning their supplies they had stopped at Nancy. To counter the American advance the Germans had moved reinforcements, including the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division Götz von Berlichingen, into the area.

==Mission==

A small SAS advance party commanded by Captain Henry Druce was parachuted into the Vosges on 12 August 1944. The drop zone was in a deeply wooded mountainous area west of Strasbourg. The advance party&#x27;s objective was to contact the local French resistance, carry out a reconnaissance of the area, identify targets for an attack and locate a suitable dropping zone for the main force.

The main party under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Brian Franks arrived 18 days after the advance party on 30 August 1944. Their landing was not without incident. A parachute equipment container filled with ammunition exploded on contact with the ground. A member of the resistance assisting to move the parachute containers died after eating plastic explosive, believing it was some sort of cheese. A Frenchman who was found in the area supposedly picking mushrooms, who the resistance believed was an informer, was detained. In the confusion following the explosion of the ammunition container, he managed to snatch up a Sten gun and was shot trying to escape.

The following day the SAS started patrolling and set up observation posts. Almost immediately they became aware that their presence had been betrayed to the Germans. There were far more Germans in the area than they expected and a force of 5,000 Germans were advancing up a valley near the village of Moussey just a short distance from the SAS base camp. The SAS&#x27;s aggressive patrolling, sabotage attacks and the number of fire fights they had engaged in, led the Germans to believe they were up against a far larger force than there actually was. Over two nights, the 19 and 20 September, reinforcements were parachuted in which consisted of six Jeeps and another 20 men. The Jeeps, armed with Vickers K and Browning machine guns, allowed the SAS to change their tactics. The Jeep patrols shot up German road convoys and staff cars. A patrol under the command of Captain Druce even entered Moussey, just as a Waffen-SS unit was assembling. Driving through the town, they opened fire and inflicted many casualties.

The Germans, unable to locate the SAS base, were aware that they could not be operating without the assistance of the local population. To gain information about the location of the SAS camp, all the male residents of Moussey between the ages of 16 and 60, a total of 210 men, were arrested. After being interrogated they were transported to concentration camps, from which only 70 returned after the war. On 29 September 1944 Captain Druce was sent to cross back over into the American lines, with the order of battle for a Panzer division which had been obtained by a member of the resistance. Initially with F/O Fiddick, R.C.A.F 622 Sqn, but alone on the second and third occasions, Druce passed through the German lines three times before eventually reaching safety.

At the start of October, with Patton&#x27;s army stalled and supplies running out, the likelihood that the Americans would relieve the SAS had dwindled. It was decided to end the operation, which had only been intended to last two weeks and had now lasted over two months. Lieutenant Colonel Franks ordered his forces to split up into small groups and make their own way back to the Allied lines away. One patrol was ambushed by the Waffen-SS, killing three men. The fourth, Lieutenant Peter Johnsen, was wounded but managed to escape. Another 34 men failed to reach Allied lines.

==Aftermath==
At the end of the war Franks began investigating the fate of his missing men. All that was known for certain was that three men accompanying Lieutenant Johnsen had been killed, and that 10 men had been buried in the cemetery at Moussey. The SAS was officially disbanded in October 1945. Prior to this the 2nd SAS War Crimes Investigation Team (2 SAS WCIT) had been formed, amongst other things, to look into the events after Loyton. 2nd SAS Intelligence Officer Major Eric &#x27;Bill&#x27; Barkworth had been informed of the existence of the Commando Order, which called for the execution of all captured commandos when he was interviewing captured German officers in 1944. In July 1945 Franks was informed by the French that the bodies of some SAS men had been found in the French occupation zone at Gaggenau.
Franks ordered 2 SAS WCIT, under the command of Major Beckworth, to travel to the area. Their investigation discovered that of the 31 missing SAS men, 30 had been murdered by the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), some of them at the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp in the Vosges mountains. One man&#x27;s fate was never discovered.

Erich Isselhorst, head of the &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; in Strasbourg, was sentenced to death by a British military tribunal in June 1946 for the murder of the British POWs but handed over to the French. He was once more sentenced to death in May 1947, now by a French military tribunal, and executed in Strasbourg on 23 February 1948. While posted in Strasbourg, Isselhorst was part of the Operation Waldfest, a scorched earth operation in which villages in Alsace and Lorraine were destroyed to eliminate shelter for Allied troops for the upcoming winter and inhabitants deported as forced labour or to concentration camps. In a coordinated operation by the Wehrmacht and SS, villages were raided, French resistance fighters and the captured SAS soldiers were executed.

Isselhorst ordered the execution of the captured British SAS members, as well as a number of French civilians, three French priests and four US airmen. The prisoners were taken over the Rhine river on trucks to Gaggenau on 21 November 1944. The leader of the execution commando, Karl Buck, thought it unwise to leave mass graves of shot allied soldiers in an area so close to the front line. The prisoners were initially kept in a local jail but then, on or shortly after 25 November, unaware of their fate, taken to a local forest and, in groups of three, shot in the head in a bomb crater. One prisoner attempted to escape but was killed as well. Apart from Isselhorst, his second in command, Wilhelm Schneider was also executed for the war crime in January 1947. Buck was sentenced to death by British and French military courts. However, he was reprieved and released from prison in 1955.
In 2003 a memorial was erected at Moussey to commemorate those who had been murdered. It details the three men from Phantom, the 31 SAS men, the 140 French civilians and one British and two French service women of the Special Operations Executive that had also been caught up in the search for the SAS camp. A memorial to the operation also exists at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.

<doc id="423133" wikidata="Q4381349" url="?curid=423133" title="Music of Equatorial Guinea">
<text>Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s culture has been less documented than most African countries, and commercial recordings remain scarce.

==National music==
The national anthem of Equatorial Guinea was written by Atanasio Ndongo Miyone and adopted in 1968, when the country gained independence from Spain . Equatorial Guinea was carved out of three former Spanish colonies: Río Muni, a strip of land between Cameroon and Gabon; Bioko, an island near Cameroon; and Annobón, an island in the Atlantic Ocean far from the mainland.

==Traditional music==

The largest ethnic group are the Fang (85.7% (1994 census) of a total 704,001 (July 2013 est.)), with 6.5% Bubi and smaller populations of Mdowe (3.6%), Annobonese (1.6%) and Bujeba (1.1%), including smaller groups such as the Ndowe, the Bisio and the Combe.

The Fang are known for their mvet, a cross between a zither and a harp. The mvet can have up to fifteen strings. The semi-spherical part of this instrument is made of bamboo and the strings are attached to the center by fibers. Music for the mvet is written in a form of musical notation that can only be learned by initiates of the bebom-mvet society. Music is typically call and response with a chorus and drums alternating. Musicians like Eyi Muan Ndong have helped to popularize folk styles.

A three- or four- person orchestra consisting of some arrangement of sanza, xylophone, drums, zithers and bow harps accompanies the many dances in Equatorial Guinea, such as the &quot;balélé&quot; and the &quot;risque ibanga&quot;.

Another popular instrument is the tam-tam, a wooden box covered with animal skin. In its center are bamboo keys installed with complete musical scales. A second type of tam-tam has two different levels of musical keys. Generally, wooden musical instruments are decorated with fauna images and geometric drawings. Drums are covered with animal skins or animal drawings.

==Popular music==

There is little popular music coming out of Equatorial Guinea. Pan-African styles like soukous and makossa are popular, as are reggae and rock and roll. Acoustic guitar bands based on a Spanish model are the country&#x27;s best-known indigenous popular tradition, especially national stars Desmali and Dambo de la Costa.

Other musicians from Equatorial Guinea include Malabo Strit Band, Luna Loca, Chiquitin, Dambo de la Costa, Ngal Madunga, Lily Afro and Spain-based exiles like Super Momo, Hijas del Sol and .

<doc id="423135" wikidata="Q3328693" url="?curid=423135" title="Music of Ivory Coast">
<text>The music of [[Ivory Coast]] includes music genres of many ethnic communities, often characterised by vocal polyphony especially among the Baoulé, talking drums especially among the Nzema people and by the characteristic polyrhythms found in rhythm in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Popular music genres from Ivory Coast include zouglou and Coupé-Décalé. A few Ivorian artists who have known international success are Magic System, Alpha Blondy, Dobet Gnahoré, Tiken Jah Fakoly, Meiway and Christina Goh.

==National music==
Ivory Coast&#x27;s national anthem is &quot;L&#x27;Abidjanaise&quot;. French is the official language taught and spoken by Ivorians but many Ivorians have their own ethnic tribal language.

There are many music genres in Ivory Coast, music from different tribes Couper Decaler, Zouglou, Pop, Arabic musics etc. Ivory Coast have different varieties of music based on the population race living there.

==Traditional music==

Ethnic groups of Ivory Coast include Akan 42.1%, Voltaic or Gur speakers 17.6%, Northern Mandes 16.5%, Krous 11%, Southern Mandes 10%, other 2.8% (includes 30,000 Lebanese and 45,000 French) (2004). The immigrant community makes up over 20% of a population of over 6 million. An estimated 65 native languages are spoken in the country. Dyula acts as a trade language and is commonly spoken by Muslims.

Each of the ethnic groups has its own folk music traditions, most showing strong vocal polyphony (a common characteristic of African music). Talking drums are common among the Nzema people, who are also known for their &quot;abissa&quot; purification dance, part of the popular &quot;N&#x27;Guess Bon Sens&quot;, &quot;Savane Alla&quot;, &quot;Kolouba Nobert&quot;, Religious music of &quot;Emi Tiapo&quot; dance music of Meiway.

==Popular music==
&quot;Gbégbé&quot;, a Bété rhythm, has been a part of popular music since Ivory Coast&#x27;s independence, popularized by Soeurs Comöé and later, Frères Djatys and Sery Simplice. Ernesto Djédjé, however, is considered the father of Ivorian popular music. Using one of the folk rhythms of the Bété, as well as his teacher Amédée Pierre&#x27;s &quot;dopé&quot; style, Djédjé has long been an advocate of Ivorian music, railing against the &quot;Congolization&quot; of the Abidjan scene. Outside of Ivory Coast, Djédjé is best known for 1977&#x27;s &quot;Gnoantre-Ziboté&quot;, which was a Pan-African hit, and found some success in France and Canada. He plays a type of music called &quot;ziglibithy&quot;.

Since Djédjé, few Ivorian musicians have been able to achieve the same level of fame. Luckson Padaud&#x27;s &quot;laba laba&quot; style, which is similar to the Bété &quot;ziglibithy&quot;, has had some success, as has Gnaore Djimi&#x27;s &quot;polihet&quot;.

===Ivorian artists in World styles===
The most popular styles in Ivory Coast are imported reggae from Jamaica, hip hop from the United States, Ndombolo from Congo, Zouk from the Caribbean and Couper Decaler; the country has produced notable musicians of both genres, especially Alpha Blondy who produces reggae. Tiken Jah Fakoly is another popular Ivorian reggae musician, who has been living in exile due to his politically outspoken lyrics. Perhaps uniquely in Africa reggae is the most popular music genre in Abidjan.

=== Hip Hop ===

Hip hop has been popular in Ivory Coast since the mid-1990s, and includes a gangsta rap-influenced style called rap dogba. Notable hip hop musicians include All Mighty, Rudy Rudiction, M.C. Claver and Angelo. The new R&amp;B group 2431(formerly known as Monah) is also taking over, as R&amp;B became very famous since U.S. chart-topping Akon had a concert in Abidjan, late 2006. Other R&amp;B stars include Teeyah and Tour de Garde. The victory of Ivorian hip hop group Kiff No Beat at the biggest hip-hop competition in Ivory Coast called Faya Flow in 2009 increased the profile of the genre there.

=== Jazz ===

Luc Sigui (born 7 April 1968 in Abidjan), is a smooth jazz guitarist &amp; singer, Luc Sigui released first album &quot;Jemima&quot;, 2008. From 2000 to 2004 he attended to famous guitarist course like, Eric Boell, Fred Sokolow, Denis Roux, to perform his jazz. In 2000 he was called by a famous African band of Pop Music called &quot;Woody&quot; to be the guitarist. In 1996, he formed with some others Ivorian Christians Musicians and singers a gospel team called Resurrection; and release 3 albums of Gospel Music. In 1991 he won the award of young budding musician of Côte d’Ivoire.Luc Sigui released with Universal, in 2008 a jazz album, called &quot;Jemima&quot; an album that ranks among the albums benchmarked for smooth jazz. 

===Zoblazo===
Zoblazo, pioneered from 1990 by Freddy Meiway, the former front man to the bands Les Genitaux, Defense d&#x27;Ivoire, and Zo Gang, integrated traditional rhythms of southern Ivory Coast with electronic instruments and party lyrics. His success across the country in the mid to late 1990s spawned a string of hit Zoblazo records that has continued through 2007, even as other dance styles, like coupé décalé have edged out Zoblazo. Even Meiway, through a series of guest musicians like Manu Dibango, Jacob Desvarieux, Lokua Kanza, Kojo Antwi and Koffi Olomidé has added Cuban, Mbalax and Ghanaian Hi-life musics.

===Zouglou===
Zouglou, a recent Ivorian popular tradition, comes from the early 1990s when university students, upset about living conditions on campus, began rallying around Didier Bilé. Zouglou was satirical in nature, and usually accompanied by a dance to a fictional god. The most popular artists of Zouglou are Petit Yodé &amp; l&#x27;enfant Siro, Magic System, Petit Denis and Espoir 2000. Many popular Ivorian zouglou artists are now living in exile due to their political support to the former president Laurent Gbagbo.

===Coupé-Décalé===
Coupé-Décalé was pioneered by the late Stephane Doukouré (a.k.. &quot;Douk-Saga&quot;) during the post-2002 militaro-political crisis in Ivory Coast. It reflects the aspirations of a large section of Ivorian youth. Coupé-Décalé is a very percussive style featuring African samples, Congo beats, deep bass, and repetitive, minimalist arrangements. Lyrically, Coupé-Décalé is about happiness, expressing daily life in 
Ivorian society, and also gives an insight into the political situation of the country. The prominent artists of Coupé-Décalé are Arafat DJ (Yôrôbô) with its concepts coming out every time that his is asked for. His music is for the youth. And many other talented Ivorian artists. The most prominent singer in actuality is named DJ Mix 1er with its croubata dance, derived from Coupé-Décalé. Other names like David Tayorault, Afrika Representer, Kédjévara, Chouchou Salvador, Anderson 1er, DJ Léo, Bébi Philip, Safarel, Serge Beynaud, Débordo Leekunfa, and Doliziana Débordo are recurrent.

<text>An embrasure (or crenel or crenelle; sometimes called gunhole in the domain of gunpowder-era architecture) is the opening in a battlement between two raised solid portions (merlons). Alternatively, an embrasure can be a space hollowed out throughout the thickness of a wall by the establishment of a bay. This term designates the internal part of this space, relative to the closing device, door or window. In fortification this refers to the outward splay of a window or of an arrowslit on the inside.

In ancient and medieval military engineering, embrasures were constructed in towers and walls. A loophole, arrow loop or arrowslit passes through a solid wall, and thus forms an embrasure of shooting, allowing archer or gunner weapons to be fired out from the fortification while the firer remains under cover.

This type of opening was flared inward - that is: the opening was very narrow on the outside, but wide on the inside, so that archers had free space of movement and aiming, while exterior attackers had as much difficulty as possible to reach them. There are embrasures especially in fortified castles and bunkers. The generic term of &quot;loophole&quot; is gradually abandoned because of its imprecision, in favour of those more precise of archer, crossbowman, gunner archer. The splay of the wall on the inside provides room for defending soldiers and their equipment, allowing them to get as close to the wall-face and to the arrowslit itself as possible. Examples of deep embrasures with arrowslits are to be seen at Aigues-Mortes and Château de Coucy, both in France.

With the introduction of firearms, the term &quot;embrasure&quot; designated more specifically the opening made in a fortified structure to allow the firing of these weapons. In modern architecture, embrasures are incorporated during construction because they are intended to receive a door or a window. These are not openings made after construction.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;embrasure&quot; () comes from French (), and is described as a hole in a parapet through which cannons are laid to fire into the moat or field.

==History==
The invention of the arrowslit is attributed to Archimedes during the siege of Syracuse in 214–212 BCE:

However, the invention was later forgotten until reintroduced in the 12th century.

By the 19th century, a distinction was made between embrasures being used for cannons, and loopholes being used for musketry. In both cases, the opening was normally made wider on the inside of the wall than the outside. The outside was made as narrow as possible (slightly wider than the muzzle of the weapon intended to use it) so as to afford the most difficult possible shot to attackers firing back, but the inside had to be wider in order to enable the weapon to be swivelled around so as to aim over a reasonably large arc.

==Variations==
A distinction was made between horizontal and vertical embrasures or loopholes, depending on the orientation of the opening formed in the outside wall. A vertical loophole—which was much more common—allows the weapon to be easily raised and lowered in elevation to cover a variety of ranges easily. To sweep from side to side, however, the weapon (and its firer or crew) must bodily move from side to side to pivot around the muzzle, which is effectively fixed by the width of the opening. A horizontal loophole, on the other hand, facilitates quick sweeping across the arc in front, but makes large adjustments in elevation very difficult. These were usually used in circumstances where the range was very restricted or where rapid cover of a wide field was preferred.

Another variation of the embrasure featured both horizontal and vertical slits arranged in the form of a cross, and was called a &quot;crosslet loop&quot; or an &quot;arbalestina&quot; since it was principally intended for arbalestiers (crossbowmen). In the 16th and 17th centuries, after the crossbow had become obsolete as a military weapon, crosslet loopholes were still sometimes created as a decorative architectural feature with Christian symbolism.

A stepped embrasure was often utilised on pillbox bunkers of the 20th century. This allowed for a relatively wide field of fire compared to a traditional embrasure while also minimising the shot trap result created by the sloped opening. A series of perpendicular &quot;steps&quot; that tapered to the gun port ensured that any incoming fire that struck the inward-facing surface of a step would be stopped or deflected laterally by the outward-facing surface of the step and not funnelled inward toward the gunner. In the 19th century, each step was known as a &#x27;redent&#x27;, based on Old French and Latin for &#x27;double notching&#x27; or &#x27;like the teeth of a saw&#x27;.

On warships of the late 1860s and onwards to the First World War, the sides of a ship&#x27;s hull might be recessed in locations near to a gun mounted in the hull. These recesses were also termed embrasures and were intended to allow a wider arc of fire than a standard broadside arrangement would otherwise permit. Central-battery ironclads like featured such embrasures for fore and aft fire from the amidships battery&#x27;s end guns. Later ironclads like featured embrasures which were &#x27;open to the sky&#x27; in that they had no overhanging structure above the recessed area. This &#x27;open-topped&#x27; embrasure became the standard arrangement for many cruisers and battleships of the pre-WW1 period. Once hull-mounted broadside weapons disappeared from the world&#x27;s navies, so did the term.

<text>Emory Scott Land (January 9, 1879 – November 27, 1971) was an officer in the United States Navy, noted for his contributions to naval architecture, particularly in submarine design. Notable assignments included serving as Chief of the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Construction and Repair during the 1930s, and as Chairman of the U.S. Maritime Commission during World War II.

==Early life and education==
From Cañon City, Colorado, Land graduated from the University of Wyoming with an A.B. degree in 1898. He then entered the United States Naval Academy, graduating on May 21, 1902. Though only 135 to 140 pounds, he played football as a halfback for four years in Laramie and four years at Annapolis. In 1900, he scored the game-winning touchdown in the Army-Navy game after recovering a blocked kick.

Following two years of sea duty, he became a naval architect specializing in submarine construction. In 1907, Land earned a master&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Wyoming and an M.S. degree in naval architecture and marine engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In June 1939, he returned to the University of Wyoming to receive an honorary doctor of laws degree.

On April 15, 1909, Land married Elizabeth Catharine Stiles in Newton Centre, Massachusetts. In her honor, Admiral Land created the Betty Styles Land Memorial Fund to finance the Ships Literary Club, known as “the public library of the seas,” which provided free books for merchant seamen.

==Career==
During World War I, he served on the Board of Devices and Plans connected with Submarines in Warfare, the Board of Standardization of Submarines, and the staff of Admiral William S. Sims, who commanded all U.S. naval forces in European waters.

Land played a key role in the design of the S-class submarines from 1917 to 1919, the United States Navy&#x27;s first attempt to build a submarine capable of operating with the battle fleet. Land was vice chairman of the Navy&#x27;s postwar V-boat Plans Committee in 1920. He was awarded the Navy Cross for his work on submarine design and construction and for work in the war zone.

===Interwar years and World War II===
In July 1922, Land qualified as a naval aviation observer in Pensacola, Florida. In January 1923, he was promoted to captain. Land subsequently earned a private pilot&#x27;s license at the age of 49. His interest in aviation was partly spurred by his wife&#x27;s cousin Charles Lindbergh. He served as assistant chief of the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics for about two years and then on extended leave as vice president and treasurer of the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics for over a year until 1930.
From October 1, 1932, until April 1, 1937, Land was Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair. In this position, he played a major role in submarine development leading to the highly successful fleet boats of World War II.

Land retired as a rear admiral in 1937, but on February 18, 1938, he became Chairman of the U.S. Maritime Commission, overseeing the design and construction of the more than 4,000 Liberty ships and Victory ships that flew the U.S. flag during World War II. Land concurrently served as Administrator of the War Shipping Administration (WSA), established by Executive Order 9054 on February 7, 1942. Thus Land exercised authority over both construction and allocation of non-combatant maritime assets to Army, Navy and commerce. In July 1944, he was advanced to vice admiral on the retired list by a special act of Congress.

Land was also instrumental in overseeing the establishment of the United States Merchant Marine Academy, located in Kings Point, New York as a commissioning source for officers entering the Merchant Marine and Naval Reserve in World War II. Land Hall, located at the Academy, is named in his honor.

===Post-war activities===
On January 15, 1946, Land resigned as Chairman of the U.S. Maritime Commission. For his outstanding services he was rewarded with both the Army Distinguished Service Medal and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal by the War Department.

==Later life and death==
Land served as President of the Air Transport Association of America from 1946 to 1957 and worked as a consultant for General Dynamics Corporation until his death in November 1971 at age 92. He lived in Washington, D.C., and continued to walk several miles daily, but died at the Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. Land was buried beside his wife at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia.
