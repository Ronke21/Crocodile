<text>John Elias Baldacci (born January 30, 1955) is an American politician who served as the 73rd governor of Maine from 2003 to 2011. A Democrat, he also served in the United States House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003 and in the Maine Senate from 1982 to 1994.

During his tenure as governor, Baldacci initiated reforms in the areas of health care, energy development, administrative reform and efficiency, public education, and led significant efforts to expand investment in workforce training and development. During his four terms in the U.S. Congress, he served on the Agriculture Committee and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. He currently serves as vice chair of the board of the non-partisan Northeast-Midwest Institute, a Washington-based, private, nonprofit, and nonpartisan research organization dedicated to economic vitality, environmental quality, and regional equity for Northeast and Midwest states.

==Early life and political career==
Born in Bangor, Maine, Baldacci grew up with seven siblings in an Italian-Lebanese family. As a child, he worked in the family business, Momma Baldacci&#x27;s restaurant in Bangor. A 1973 graduate of Bangor High School, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from the University of Maine at Orono in 1986.

Baldacci was first elected to public office in 1978 at the age of 23, when he served on the Bangor City Council. He continued in politics, winning election to the Maine Senate in 1982 from a Bangor-area district. He was reelected two times, serving a total of 12 years.

==United States House of Representatives==

In 1994, following the retirement of his cousin, United States Senator George J. Mitchell, Baldacci won election to the U.S. House of Representatives from Maine&#x27;s Second District, replacing Olympia Snowe, who had moved on to Mitchell&#x27;s open Senate seat. He defeated fellow state senator Rick Bennett in one of the few Democratic pickups of the 1994 cycle, taking 47 percent to Bennett&#x27;s 41 percent.

Baldacci would never face another contest nearly that close, and was reelected to Congress three times with well over 70 percent of the vote. He served on the House Agriculture Committee and the House Transportation Committee.

==Governor of Maine==
===2002 election===

A Democrat, Baldacci was first elected in the 2002 Maine gubernatorial election with 47.2% of the vote, defeating Republican nominee Peter Cianchette, who garnered 41.5% of the vote, Green Independent nominee Jonathan Carter, who received 9%, and unenrolled former Democrat John Michael, who received 2%. Baldacci was sworn in as Maine&#x27;s governor on January 8, 2003. In 2006, Baldacci won re-election from a field of four major candidates. As governor, he was a member of the National Governors Association and the Democratic Governors Association.

===First term===
After being elected, Baldacci attempted to fill a $1.2-billion deficit. This was done through budget cuts, consolidation, and fee increases. Baldacci refused to raise broad-based taxes, honoring a campaign pledge. Baldacci won approval for major initiatives including Dirigo Health, the Maine Community College System, and Pine Tree Development Zones (PTDZ).

Pine Tree Development Zones were enacted in 2004 and offered eligible businesses the chance to greatly reduce or virtually eliminate state taxes for up to ten years when they create new, quality jobs in certain business sectors or move existing jobs in those sectors to Maine. However, a report released in 2014 showed that the PTDZ program was ineffective, costing state government more than it brought in. Over the first ten years of the program, it cost Maine $457 million.

Baldacci&#x27;s overhaul of the healthcare system was established with his Dirigo Health Care Act. The program offers subsidized health care to individuals and Maine businesses with fewer than 50 employees. The program expanded wellness centers across the state. Individuals in the system enjoy preventive care when most other insurance policies rejected people with preexisting conditions. Proponents claim that the preventive care eventually lowers health care costs.

With the Maine Community College System he took technical colleges and revamped them into community colleges by adding more courses, more teachers and programs relevant to the communities in which they were established. He passed legislation that made it possible for credits and degrees from the community colleges to be transferable to the University of Maine system if student wished to pursue a four-year degree. The community college system grew exponentially adding new satellites. In their first three years, Maine&#x27;s community colleges grew 42 percent. The demand is so great there are waiting lists for admission.

In 2005, Baldacci introduced legislation to expand Maine&#x27;s civil rights law to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. This legislation in Maine had been defeated via referendum by voters two times before. The law passed, but opponents of the law initiated a referendum to overturn the law. Voters upheld the new law.

Baldacci is a supporter of regionalization, a sometimes contentious policy of merging local-government services to save money on administrative costs.

===2006 election===

Baldacci ran for reelection in 2006, facing opposition from Republican Chandler Woodcock, Independents Barbara Merrill and Phillip Napier, and Green Independent Party candidate Pat LaMarche.

Democratic-leaning voters had a wide array of choices. Merrill, who was elected to her state house seat as a Democrat, Woodcock, and LaMarche received money from Maine&#x27;s Clean Elections law. Merrill and LaMarche were generally seen as taking votes from Baldacci, while Woodcock&#x27;s socially conservative position prompted many longtime Republicans to throw their votes to Baldacci, Merrill, or LaMarche.

Baldacci won the election with 38.11% of the vote. Woodcock placed second with 30%. Merrill received a surprising 21%, narrowly defeating Baldacci among unenrolled voters. LaMarche finished with 10%, enough to maintain ballot access for the Green Party.

===Second term===
Baldacci was inaugurated on January 3, 2007, in Augusta. Baldacci, in his second term, built on the foundation he created in his first four years in office. He increased Maine&#x27;s competitiveness in the global economy; streamlined government services; attracted good jobs; and ensured that all Mainers have access to quality education, workforce training, and health care. In 2008 the recession hit forcing more consolidation efforts and Baldacci never increased state income taxes. He left office with a surplus and a rainy day fund.

During his inaugural speech, Baldacci reaffirmed his goal for school administration consolidation. Shortly after he began his second term, his biennial budget proposal included consolidating Maine&#x27;s 152 school districts into 26 Regional School Units. Maine has four forms of government: state, county, local towns and school administration districts. Consolidation of the school administration districts led to cutting back jobs that were duplicated and the savings were then put back into the classrooms.

In 2007, Baldacci announced a plan to send 125 Maine prisoners to the private Corrections Corporation of America called North Fork Correctional Facility in Sayre, Oklahoma, to ease crowding at the Maine State Prison in Warren. Critics, such as the Maine Civil Liberties Union called for supervised release of non-violent prisoners and sentence commutation for model inmates to ease overcrowding instead. The proposal was killed by the Maine Legislature. However, in 2009, Baldacci&#x27;s administration again suggested that the state could relocate prisoners to Oklahoma. The owner and operator of the Oklahoma prison, Corrections Corporation of America, indirectly contributed to Baldacci&#x27;s re-election campaign and hired Baldacci&#x27;s cousin and advisor, Jim Mitchell, as a lobbyist.

Baldacci continued a major effort to promote alternative energies and energy independence for the state. Maine homes and businesses were heated 86 percent with oil. As of 2011, that declined to 76 percent. Baldacci&#x27;s programs promoted wood pellets, which were manufactured in the state using Maine&#x27;s vast forest lands, as well as wind, solar, biofuels and wave technologies. He also started the Energy Efficiency Trust. He successfully created new standards and goals for the states Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS). These RPS standards encouraged alternative energy suppliers to invest in Maine using the state&#x27;s natural resources sustainably. Offshore wind technologies for floating wind turbines developed at the University of Maine brought Energy Sec. Steven Chu to visit the University and the Department of Energy has given the university various grants to continue the research.

Baldacci also brought the region&#x27;s leaders together for a special conference to coordinate and cooperate on regional energy efforts such as the infrastructure needed to carry the electricity to markets. In addition Baldacci led the effort for Maine to become part of the first cap and trade state consortium for East coast states called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which has brought in $83 million to the state for weatherization programs.

Throughout Baldacci&#x27;s eight years he promoted a number of bond efforts that were passed by the people of Maine to increase research and development in the state focusing on sectors of growth and innovation. These bonds helped to transform research and development in biomedicine, composites and forest products at Maine&#x27;s leading educational institutions.

In February 2008, Baldacci hosted an official visit to Maine by Premier of New Brunswick, Shawn Graham, which was the first official visit to Maine by an incumbent head of a Canadian province. In his visit, Graham addressed a joint session of the Maine Legislature in which he proposed increasing cross-border trade, tourism, transportation as well as additional co-operation on energy and education.

In the 2008 Democratic Presidential primary Baldacci, as a superdelegate, pledged his support for Hillary Clinton despite Barack Obama winning the state&#x27;s Democratic Presidential Primary. By June 2008, it was clear that Obama would be the nominee and he announced his support for Obama.

On May 6, 2009, Baldacci signed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage in Maine. This made him the first governor ever in the U.S. to sign a same-sex marriage bill into law where it was not previously court-ordered. (The Governor of Connecticut, Mary Jodi Rell, had been the first to sign a bill codifying same-sex marriage into law on April 23, 2009.) Maine&#x27;s legalization of same-sex marriage was narrowly overturned by a statewide referendum vote on November 3, 2009, but brought back on a pro-same-sex marriage referendum on November 6, 2012, and became law.

Baldacci left office in 2011, and was succeeded by Republican Paul LePage.

==Personal life and family==
Baldacci lived with his wife Karen and son Jack in the Blaine House in Augusta, while governor.

Baldacci&#x27;s brother, Joe, is a member of the Bangor City Council. He is a first cousin once removed of former Maine senator and majority leader George J. Mitchell and a second cousin of author David Baldacci. In addition, he is also related to State Representative Chris Greeley, who like Baldacci and Mitchell, is half-Lebanese. His wife Karen was the head of Maine Reads, a nonprofit umbrella organization for &quot;Read With ME&quot;, privately funded by Verizon. Karen now works as a registered dietitian (RD) at the Supplemental Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) in Portland.

Baldacci held a technician class amateur radio license with call sign KB1NXP, which expired in 2018.

<text>The Alaska State Legislature is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Alaska. It is a bicameral institution consisting of the 40-member Alaska House of Representatives (lower house) and the 20-member Alaska Senate (upper house). There are 40 House Districts (1–40) and 20 Senate Districts (A–T). With a total of 60 lawmakers, the Alaska State Legislature is the smallest bicameral state legislature in the United States and the second-smallest of all state legislatures (only the 49-member unicameral Nebraska Legislature is smaller). There are no term limits for either chamber. The Alaska State Legislature meets in the Alaska State Capitol in Juneau. The current meeting, since January 21, 2025 is the 34th Alaska State Legislature. The previous meeting, 33rd Alaska State Legislature, met from 2023 to 2025. Before that, the 32nd Alaska State Legislature, met from 2021 to 2023.

==Organization==

===Non-professional legislature===
Unlike other state legislatures with longer sessions, the Alaska State Legislature&#x27;s comparatively short session allows many lawmakers to retain outside employment, especially in the state&#x27;s many seasonal industries, such as fishing and tourism. In this, the Alaska State Legislature retains some of the volunteer nature that characterized most state legislatures until the middle of the 20th century. This has led to recurring but minor controversy around the potential for conflict of interest inherent in legislators&#x27; outside employment.

===Terms and qualifications===

A candidate for legislative office must be a qualified voter and resident of Alaska for no less than three years, and a resident of the district from which elected for one year immediately preceding filing for office. A senator must be at least 25 years of age and a representative 21 years of age at the time the oath of office is taken.

Each chamber of the legislature may expel a member with the concurrence of two-thirds of the membership of that house. This has happened only once in the legislature&#x27;s history. On February 5, 1982, the Alaska Senate of the 12th Legislature expelled Bethel senator George Hohman from the body. Hohman was convicted of bribery in conjunction with his legislative duties on December 24, 1981, and had defiantly refused to resign from his seat. Expulsion was unnecessary during the more recent Alaska political corruption probe, as legislators targeted by the probe resigned, lost renomination or re-election, or did not seek re-election.

The Alaska Constitution gives the legislature the authority to set the term start date. Legislative terms begin on the second Monday in January following a presidential election year and on the third Tuesday in January following a gubernatorial election. Representatives have a two-year term, and senators have a four-year term. One-half of the senators shall be elected every two years.

===Meetings===
Annual sessions begin in January and are limited by statute to 90 calendar days. Special sessions of 30 calendar days may be convened by a consensus of two-thirds of each house.

In the 2006 elections, a voter initiative was passed that reduced the statutory length of the session from 121 days to 90 days. The 2008 session was the first 90-day session. Although the session adjourned on time, opponents of the shorter session claimed that legislation was rushed and public input was jeopardized.

==Legislative process==

===Introduction===
Legislators introduce a bill by giving it to the Chief Clerk of the Alaska House of Representatives or the Secretary of the Alaska Senate. Bills submitted by the governor are introduced through a Rules Committee in either chamber. The chief clerk of the house or the senate secretary assigns each bill a number.

During session, a bill is introduced and first read by number, sponsor or sponsors, and title. The bill is then referred to a committee or multiple committees. Both chambers have the following committees: Finance; Health, Education and Social Services; Judiciary; Labor and Commerce; Community and Regional Affairs; Resources; Rules; State Affairs and Transportation; and any subcommittees created by committee chairs.

===Committee work===
Committee chairs can choose whether or not to hear a bill, and committees can vote to approve a bill in its original form or make modifications through a committee substitute. Once bills or substitutes are approved, the legislation is referred to the next committee of assignment or to the Rules Committee, which can further amend the bill or assign it to the chamber&#x27;s daily calendar.

===Floor action===
Once the Rules Committee has scheduled a bill on the chamber floor, it appears on the calendar in Second Reading. The bill is again read by number, sponsor or sponsors, and title, along with the standing committee reports. A motion is made on the floor to adopt any committee substitutes. Amendments can also be offered and voted on. Third Reading is where the motion is made to vote on the bill.

===Opposite chamber===
After final passage in either the Alaska House of Representatives or Alaska Senate, a bill is engrossed and sent to the opposite house to go through the same process of introduction, committee referral, and three readings.

===Enactment===
When a bill is not modified in the second house, that house can send it to the governor on Third Reading, through enrollment. If the bill is modified, the house of origin must vote to accept or reject amendments by the opposite house. A Fourth Reading, in the case of acceptance, will send the bill to the governor, through enrollment. If amendments are rejected, the bill can be sent to conference, where members of the Senate and House hash out a final version and send it to a Fourth Reading in both houses.

The governor can choose to sign or veto the legislation. In the case of the veto, a two-thirds majority can override the veto. If signed or approved by a veto override, the legislation becomes law. Unlike in many states, the governor does not have the power of the pocket veto.

==Caucuses==
Unlike many other state legislative chambers in the United States, both houses of the Alaska State Legislature have a longstanding tradition of majority caucuses encompassing members of both major parties (Republican and Democratic). Democrats caucusing with the majority are colloquially known as &quot;Bush Democrats,&quot; a reference to the Alaskan bush country from which they typically hail. Members of the minority party caucusing with the majority are treated as members of the majority for purposes of committee assignments and caucus meetings.

<text>The Oregon Electric Railway (OE) was an interurban railroad line in the U.S. state of Oregon that linked Portland to Eugene.

==History==
Service from Portland to Salem began in January 1908. The Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway purchased the system in 1910, and extended service to Eugene in 1912. After the company requested, and received, permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission to abandon a section of line in Portland because of declining ridership and worsening traffic congestion. Passenger service was cut back to Front and Jefferson streets the following day, and OE moved its ticket office to that location. The tracks along 10th and Salmon streets were abandoned and soon removed. Regular passenger service in the Willamette Valley ended in May 1933.

Electrified freight service continued until dieselization in 1945. The Oregon Electric was merged into the new Burlington Northern Railroad in 1970. The Burlington Northern operated the last freight train on the ex-OE Forest Grove branch on December 31, 1994, in preparation for the construction of Westside MAX, part of the TriMet light rail system.

==Route==
The tracks run parallel to the main modern Union Pacific line between Portland and Eugene, used for freight and passenger service. The OE line is to the west, closely following the Willamette River. In the 2000s, the line has been under consideration as an alternative for Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Cascades&quot; and &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; passenger lines. Removing passenger service from the clogged Union Pacific track would improve the timeliness of the trains, permit higher capacity, and allow higher-speed travel, peaking at .

The right-of-way between Portland and Tigard has since been abandoned. From the North Bank Depot, it followed 10th Avenue, Salmon Street, and the west bank of the Willamette River. Portions of the right-of-way between the South Waterfront and Multnomah Boulevard are currently under Interstate 5.

==Remnants==
* The Forest Grove Station is now owned by Friends of Historical Forest Grove, which is the town&#x27;s historical society, This station was Southern Pacific Red electric, Forest Grove Oregon Electric station was located behind current fire station.
*The former Oregon Electric line from Tigard to Eugene is now operated by the Portland &amp; Western Railroad. BN donated the track from Tigard to Quinaby (a farming community north of Keizer) to the State of Oregon and sold the track to the Portland &amp; Western. South of Quinaby, the line is still owned by BN successor BNSF and leased to P&amp;W for operation.
* The OE branch between Hillsboro and Beaverton is now part of the MAX Blue Line.
*Passenger service is again available on the segment from Tigard to Wilsonville as part of the Westside Express Service (WES) commuter rail line. WES service continues north of Tigard to Beaverton using a former Southern Pacific track that the OE had used since the mid-1930s when its own route north of Tigard to downtown Portland was abandoned. The OE used to join with the ex-Southern Pacific track at Greton, located in the northern part of Tigard near the intersection of S.W. North Dakota Street and S.W. Tiedeman Avenue. Today, the original OE track ends and joins the former SP line southeast of S.W. Hall Boulevard. The parking lot of the current WES station in downtown Tigard is where the OE tracks used to lie; the abandoned right-of-way is still plainly visible north of downtown Tigard.
*The former station in Eugene had been reused and housed the Oregon Electric Station restaurant.
*The Albany station was a video poker outlet and later a pizza parlor. It underwent renovations from 2022 to 2025 to prepare for conversion into a restaurant.
*The Multnomah depot was located at the current site of the John&#x27;s Market parking lot, on the northwest corner of SW 35th and Multnomah Blvd. The adjacent 1913 Nelson Thomas Building, characterized as &quot;streetcar era commercial&quot; architecture, still stands.
*The North Bank Depot in Portland was the northern terminal for the OE from 1912 to 1931. Used also as a warehouse, the building (and a matching one across the street) was preserved and converted into condominiums in the 1990s.
*The site of the Tigard station is now occupied by the Tigard Chamber of Commerce.
*The former Springfield Southern Pacific station was leased to Oregon Electric for a brief period. Is now a museum. It has an authentic semaphore signal and baggage car outside.
*Several of the railway&#x27;s electric substations still exist, including those at Tonquin and Waconda.

<doc id="426219" wikidata="Q377930" url="?curid=426219" title="Classical electromagnetism">
<text>Classical electromagnetism or classical electrodynamics is a branch of physics focused on the study of interactions between electric charges and currents using an extension of the classical Newtonian model. It is, therefore, a classical field theory. The theory provides a description of electromagnetic phenomena whenever the relevant length scales and field strengths are large enough that quantum mechanical effects are negligible. For small distances and low field strengths, such interactions are better described by quantum electrodynamics which is a quantum field theory.

== History ==
The physical phenomena that electromagnetism describes have been studied as separate fields since antiquity. For example, there were many advances in the field of optics centuries before light was understood to be an electromagnetic wave. However, the theory of electromagnetism, as it is currently understood, grew out of Michael Faraday&#x27;s experiments suggesting the existence of an electromagnetic field and James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s use of differential equations to describe it in his &quot;A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism&quot; (1873). The development of electromagnetism in Europe included the development of methods to measure voltage, current, capacitance, and resistance. Detailed historical accounts are given by Wolfgang Pauli, E. T. Whittaker, Abraham Pais, and Bruce J. Hunt.

== Lorentz force ==
The electromagnetic field exerts the following force (often called the Lorentz force) on charged particles:

:formula_1

where all boldfaced quantities are vectors: is the force that a particle with charge &quot;q&quot; experiences, is the electric field at the location of the particle, is the velocity of the particle, is the magnetic field at the location of the particle.

The above equation illustrates that the Lorentz force is the sum of two vectors. One is the cross product of the velocity and magnetic field vectors. Based on the properties of the cross product, this produces a vector that is perpendicular to both the velocity and magnetic field vectors. The other vector is in the same direction as the electric field. The sum of these two vectors is the Lorentz force.

Although the equation appears to suggest that the electric and magnetic fields are independent, the equation can be rewritten in term of four-current (instead of charge) and a single electromagnetic tensor that represents the combined field (formula_2):
:formula_3

==Electric field==
The electric field E is defined such that, on a stationary charge:

:formula_4

where &quot;q&quot;0 is what is known as a test charge and is the force on that charge. The size of the charge does not really matter, as long as it is small enough not to influence the electric field by its mere presence. What is plain from this definition, though, is that the unit of is N/C (newtons per coulomb). This unit is equal to V/m (volts per meter); see below.

In electrostatics, where charges are not moving, around a distribution of point charges, the forces determined from Coulomb&#x27;s law may be summed. The result after dividing by &quot;q&quot;0 is:

:formula_5

where &quot;n&quot; is the number of charges, &quot;qi&quot; is the amount of charge associated with the &quot;i&quot;th charge, r&quot;i&quot; is the position of the &quot;i&quot;th charge, r is the position where the electric field is being determined, and &quot;ε&quot;0 is the electric constant.

If the field is instead produced by a continuous distribution of charge, the summation becomes an integral:

:formula_6

where formula_7 is the charge density and formula_8 is the vector that points from the volume element formula_9 to the point in space where E is being determined.

Both of the above equations are cumbersome, especially if one wants to determine E as a function of position. A scalar function called the electric potential can help. Electric potential, also called voltage (the units for which are the volt), is defined by the line integral

:formula_10

where formula_11 is the electric potential, and &quot;C&quot; is the path over which the integral is being taken.

Unfortunately, this definition has a caveat. From Maxwell&#x27;s equations, it is clear that is not always zero, and hence the scalar potential alone is insufficient to define the electric field exactly. As a result, one must add a correction factor, which is generally done by subtracting the time derivative of the A vector potential described below. Whenever the charges are quasistatic, however, this condition will be essentially met.

From the definition of charge, one can easily show that the electric potential of a point charge as a function of position is:

:formula_12

where &quot;q&quot; is the point charge&#x27;s charge, r is the position at which the potential is being determined, and r&quot;i&quot; is the position of each point charge. The potential for a continuous distribution of charge is:

:formula_13

where formula_7 is the charge density, and formula_8 is the distance from the volume element formula_9 to point in space where &quot;φ&quot; is being determined.

The scalar &quot;φ&quot; will add to other potentials as a scalar. This makes it relatively easy to break complex problems down into simple parts and add their potentials. Taking the definition of &quot;φ&quot; backwards, we see that the electric field is just the negative gradient (the del operator) of the potential. Or:

:formula_17

From this formula it is clear that E can be expressed in V/m (volts per meter).

== Electromagnetic waves ==
A changing electromagnetic field propagates away from its origin in the form of a wave. These waves travel in vacuum at the speed of light and exist in a wide spectrum of wavelengths. Examples of the dynamic fields of electromagnetic radiation (in order of increasing frequency): radio waves, microwaves, light (infrared, visible light and ultraviolet), x-rays and gamma rays. In the field of particle physics this electromagnetic radiation is the manifestation of the electromagnetic interaction between charged particles.

== General field equations ==
As simple and satisfying as Coulomb&#x27;s equation may be, it is not entirely correct in the context of classical electromagnetism. Problems arise because changes in charge distributions require a non-zero amount of time to be &quot;felt&quot; elsewhere (required by special relativity).

For the fields of general charge distributions, the retarded potentials can be computed and differentiated accordingly to yield Jefimenko&#x27;s equations.

Retarded potentials can also be derived for point charges, and the equations are known as the Liénard–Wiechert potentials. The scalar potential is:

:formula_18

where formula_19 is the point charge&#x27;s charge and formula_20 is the position. formula_21 and formula_22are the position and velocity of the charge, respectively, as a function of retarded time. The vector potential is similar:

:formula_23

These can then be differentiated accordingly to obtain the complete field equations for a moving point particle.

== Models ==
Branches of classical electromagnetism such as optics, electrical and electronic engineering consist of a collection of relevant mathematical models of different degrees of simplification and idealization to enhance the understanding of specific electrodynamics phenomena. An electrodynamics phenomenon is determined by the particular fields, specific densities of electric charges and currents, and the particular transmission medium. Since there are infinitely many of them, in modeling there is a need for some typical, representative
:(a) electrical charges and currents, e.g. moving pointlike charges and electric and magnetic dipoles, electric currents in a conductor etc.;
:(b) electromagnetic fields, e.g. voltages, the Liénard–Wiechert potentials, the monochromatic plane waves, optical rays, radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, gamma rays etc.;
:(c) transmission media, e.g. electronic components, antennas, electromagnetic waveguides, flat mirrors, mirrors with curved surfaces convex lenses, concave lenses; resistors, inductors, capacitors, switches; wires, electric and optical cables, transmission lines, integrated circuits etc.; all of which have only few variable characteristics.

<text>The Massachusetts General Court, formally the General Court of Massachusetts, is the state legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts located in the state capital of Boston. The name &quot;General Court&quot; is a holdover from the earliest days of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, when the colonial assembly, in addition to making laws, sat as a judicial court of appeals. Before the adoption of the state constitution in 1780, it was called the Great and General Court, but the official title was shortened by John Adams, author of the state constitution. It is a bicameral body. The upper house is the Massachusetts Senate which is composed of 40 members. The lower body, the Massachusetts House of Representatives, has 160 members; until 1978, the state house had 240 members. It meets in the Massachusetts State House on Beacon Hill in Boston.

Since 1959, Democrats have controlled both houses of the Massachusetts General Court, often by large majorities. The Democrats enjoyed veto-proof supermajorities in both chambers for part of the 1990s (i.e., enough votes to override vetoes by a governor) and also currently hold supermajorities in both chambers.

State senators and representatives both serve two-year terms. There are no term limits; a term limit was enacted by initiative in Massachusetts in 1994 but in 1997 was struck down by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, which ruled that it was an unconstitutional attempt to provide additional qualifications for office by statute, rather than constitutional amendment.

The legislature is a full-time legislature, although not to the extent of neighboring New York or some other states.

== History ==
===Massachusetts Bay Colony===
The earliest history of the General Court is in the original charter of 1629. Massachusetts Bay Colony, one of the original Thirteen Colonies, was a royally chartered joint stock company founded in 1628 in London. Much like other joint-stock companies of the time the first General Court was a meeting of shareholders, known as freemen. The &quot;Great and General Court&quot; was to meet in London and elect its officers and members in the same manner as other colonial charted companies of the time such as the Virginia Company and the East India Company. The freemen would meet annually to elect representatives in the form of a Royal Governor, a Deputy Governor, and a Council made from the directors of the company. These officials were to have royally assented governmental control of the colony and would be tasked with the management and defense of the colonial plantation. The first Court assembled would be made from these members to discuss and evaluate the situation of the colony.

The first meeting of the original General Court took place in London in 1629. The General Court selected John Endicott as its representative to the colony. Soon after, Governor John Winthrop and the Deputy Governor Thomas Dudley broke with protocol when they themselves traveled to New England and moved the government to Massachusetts Bay. Along with them came the stock holders of the company and the Council of Assistants.

Once in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the new government reorganized itself out of convenience. Instead of attempting to assemble all stockholders to the meeting of the General Court the government decided on having each town elect two representatives to send in their stead. The General Court became a &quot;de facto&quot; bicameral legislature by virtue of the distinction between delegates elected by towns and the Council of Assistants. The assistants acted as magistrates and counselors of jurisprudence, however when in session they served as a sort of upper house. Their assent and approval was needed in order for any decision from the house of delegates to be passed. The new legislature was elected annually.

Suffrage was allowed only for men who were Puritan church members and freemen. This General Court removed any feudal restraints on the population and codified a Bill of Rights and powers of a judiciary. The General Court also enshrined the Laws of Moses as legal code under the discretion of local magistrates creating a theocratic quasi-democratic state.

By votes of the General Court in the 1630s, the system of government changed to have an elected governor and to restrict the list of &quot;freemen&quot; to those affiliated with certain Puritan churches. In 1634, after complaint the charter was not being followed, a compromise resulted in recomposition of the General Court as two deputies elected by freemen in each town. Problems with a judicial case resulted in another reform in 1638, where the Council of Assistants became an upper house that sat separately, with consent of both houses required to pass legislation.

In October 1650 the General Court took exception to the book &quot;The Meritorious Price of Our Redemption&quot; by William Pynchon. They regarded it as containing many errors and heresies and thus destroyed it at Boston Common.

===Province of Massachusetts Bay in New England===

With the collapse of the Dominion of New England in the Glorious Revolution in 1689 The Assistants convened an assembly of delegates from each town to reform the General Court.

With the Massachusetts Charter in 1691 the Province of Massachusetts Bay absorbed the colony of Plymouth. The Plymouth Colony, along with the District of Maine and the islands off Cape Cod, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and Nantucket were to be an extension of Massachusetts and thus under the authority of the General Court.

Under this new system the religious qualification, that suffrage be for only Puritan men, was changed to a qualification of property ownership. The Assistants were also officially changed to a Governor&#x27;s Council to be selected by the governor to act as an upper house as well as a council for advice and consent. All laws passed by the General Court were to be approved by Royal Governor of the province. The powers of the monarch to be expanded in this new system as well. The King had full control of maritime affairs and acted as an executive, through the Royal Governor, to enforce commercial law.

This separation of powers led to some friction with the Royal Governor and the General Court. The General Court retained power over spending and budget and while the Royal Officers, in the form of the Governor, the Governor&#x27;s Council, etc. had more executive authority the Court could cause political stalemate if its demands were not met. Even the Governor&#x27;s reserve power to dissolve the General Court was ineffective because a new assembly had to be elected the following year.

With the passage of the Intolerable Acts by the Parliament of Great Britain there was political turmoil in the province. With political disorder Thomas Gage, then the Royal Governor, cancelled the new elections for the General Court and in 1774 the assembly was essentially dissolved. This allowed the governor to rule by decree and appoint town governments.

In defiance of both Crown law and Gage, members of the General Court formed the Massachusetts Provincial Congress and seized control of the colony except for Boston, where British troops maintained control until when they evacuated the city on March 17, 1776. The Governor&#x27;s Council acted as the executive in the absence of the governor and lieutenant governor, administering the rebel forces of the colony during the early years of the American Revolutionary War, which began in Massachusetts at the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. The General Assembly declared Massachusetts independent from Britain on May 1, 1776. With the war still ongoing, demands for government reform resulted in the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1778, but the text proposed by the legislature failed in a statewide voter referendum. The Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1779–1780 was held by a specially-elected body, and the resulting text, after amendment and ratification, became the current state constitution.

===Later history===

The current Massachusetts General Court has met as the legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts since the adoption of the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780. The body was in operation before Massachusetts became a U.S. state on February 6, 1788.

The first sessions, starting in 1780, were one-year elected sessions for both houses. This was expanded to two-year sessions starting with the 142nd General Court in January 1921. Thereafter, the legislative year was defined as: &quot;The first legislative year starting with the opening of the biennial session and ends at midnight on Tuesday before the first Wednesday of the following year. The second legislative year starts on the first Wednesday of the second year and ends when the legislature prorogues or at midnight on Tuesday before the first Wednesday of the following year.

Watson F. Hammond, seated in 1885, was the first Native American to be elected to the body.

Florence Slocomb was one of the first three women in the Commonwealth to be elected to the state Legislature and the first woman from Worcester to win a state legislative seat, representing that district from 1926 to 1928.

Althea Garrison was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1992 and is known as the first transgender person to serve in a state legislature in the United States. She was outed against her will following the election and served one term.

As of 2018, the General Court was composed of 75 percent male and 25 percent female representation.

==Chambers==
=== Senate ===
There are 40 senatorial districts in Massachusetts, named for the counties in which they are located.

=== House of Representatives ===
There are 160 representational districts in Massachusetts, named for the counties in which they are located. The speaker of the House has historically been quite powerful, exerting significant influence over all aspects of state government.

==Current joint committees and members==

== Legislative procedure ==
The General Court is responsible for enacting laws in the state. The two legislative branches work concurrently on pending laws brought before them.

Lawmaking begins when legislators, or their delegates, file petitions accompanied by bills, resolves or other types of legislation electronically, using the Legislative Automated Workflow System (LAWS). The electronically submitted legislation is received in the House or Senate Clerk&#x27;s office where the petitions, bills, and resolves are recorded in an electronic docket book. The clerks number the bills and assign them to appropriate joint committees. There are 26 of these committees, each responsible for studying the bills which pertain to specific policy areas, taxation, education, health care, insurance, and others. Each committee is composed of six senators and eleven representatives. The standing committees schedule public hearings for the individual bills, which afford citizens, legislators and lobbyists the opportunity to express their views. Committee members meet at a later time in executive session to review the public testimony and discuss the merits of each bill before making their recommendations to the full membership of the House or Senate. The public may still observe &quot;executive&quot; sessions, but may not participate in these meetings. The committee then issues its report, recommending that a bill &quot;ought to pass&quot; or &quot;ought not to pass&quot; and the report is submitted to the Clerk&#x27;s office.

The first reading of a favorably reported bill is automatic and generally occurs when the committee&#x27;s report appears in the Journal of the House or Senate. Matters not requiring reference to another Joint, House or Senate committee are, following the first reading, referred without debate to the Committee on Senate Rules if reported in the Senate, except certain special laws (relative to a city or town) are placed directly on the Senate Calendar (Orders of the Day), or, without debate to the House Steering, Policy and Scheduling committee if reported into the House. Reports from Senate Rules or House Steering, Policy and Scheduling are placed on the Calendar of the Chamber receiving the report for a second reading. If a bill reported favorably by a joint committee affects health care it is referred by the House or Senate Clerk to the joint committee on Health Care Financing; and the first reading is delayed until the next favorable report, thus allowing Health Care Financing to report to either the House or Senate. The Health Care Financing Committee is required to provide an estimated cost of the bill, when making their report. If the estimated cost is less than $100,000, the bill bypasses having to be referred to Ways and Means. If a bill is not related to health care, but affects the finances of the Commonwealth, or, if it is reported by the Health Care Financing Committee with an estimated cost greater than $100,000, it is referred to the Senate or House Committee on Ways and Means after the first reading. Adverse reports (&quot;ought not to pass&quot;) are also referred to the Committee on Steering and Policy in the Senate or placed without debate in the Orders of the Day for the next session of the House. Acceptance by either branch of an adverse report is considered the final rejection and the matter of the matter. However, an adverse report can be overturned. A member may move to substitute the bill for the report, and, if the motion to substitute carries, the matter is then given its first reading and follows the same procedure as if reported favorably by committee.

After a bill is read for a second time, it is open to debate on amendments and motions. Following debate, a vote is taken and if the bill receives a favorable vote by the membership, it is ordered to a third reading and referred to the Committee on Bills in the Third Reading. This amounts to preliminary approval of the bill in that branch. That committee examines technical points, as well as the legality and constitutionality of the measure, and ensures that it does not duplicate or contradict existing law. The committee then issues a report and returns the bill to the House or Senate for its third reading. At that time, legislators can further debate and amend the bill. Following the third reading, the body votes on &quot;passing the bill to be engrossed.&quot;

The bill must then pass through three readings and engrossment in the second legislative branch. Should that occur, it is sent to the Legislative Engrossing Division where it is typed on special parchment in accordance with the General Laws. However, if the second branch passes an amended version of the bill, the legislation returns to the original branch for a vote of concurrence in the amendment. If concurrence is rejected, a conference committee consisting of the three members from each legislative branch representing both political parties may be formed to effect a compromise piece of legislation. When a compromise is reached, the bill is sent to both legislative branches for their approval.

A vote &quot;to enact&quot; the bill, first in the House and later in the Senate, is the final step in the passage of a bill by the legislature. Following enactment, the bill goes to the governor, who may sign the bill into law, allow it to become law without signing it (if the governor holds the bill for ten days without taking any action while the legislature is in session, it becomes law without his or her signature), veto it, or return it to the legislature with recommended changes. If the legislature has concluded its yearly session, and the governor does not sign the bill within ten days, it dies. This is referred to as a &quot;pocket veto.&quot; This ten-day period includes Sundays and holidays, even if they fall on the tenth day, and it begins the day after the legislation is laid on the governor&#x27;s desk.

A bill signed by the governor, or passed by two-thirds of both branches over his veto, becomes a law. It is usually effective in ninety days. The day after the governor signs the bill is considered to be the first day, and each succeeding day, including Sundays and holidays is counted until the ninetieth. Laws considered &quot;emergency&quot; in nature take effect immediately upon signing if the legislature has voted to attach an &quot;emergency preamble&quot; to the bill. Adoption of the preamble requires a two-thirds standing vote of the membership. The governor may also declare an act to be an emergency law and make it effective at once. A special act takes effect thirty days from the day it is signed, unless it contains a provision to make it effective immediately.

<text>This article lists the [[Head of state|heads of state]] of [[Libya]] since the country&#x27;s independence in 1951.

Libya has been in a tumultuous state since the start of the Arab Spring-related Libyan crisis in 2011; the crisis resulted in the collapse of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and the killing of Muammar Gaddafi, amidst the First Civil War and the foreign military intervention. The crisis was deepened by the factional violence in the aftermath of the First Civil War, resulting in the outbreak of the Second Civil War in 2014. The control over the country is currently split between the Government of National Stability (GNS)—supported by the House of Representatives (HoR)—in Tobruk and the Government of National Unity (GNU) in Tripoli and their respective supporters, as well as various jihadist groups and tribal elements controlling parts of the country.

<text>The University of New Zealand was New Zealand&#x27;s sole degree-granting university from 1874 to 1961. It was a collegiate university embracing several constituent institutions at various locations around New Zealand. 

After the University of New Zealand was dissolved in 1961, its constituent colleges became four independent degree-granting universities and two associated agricultural colleges: the University of Otago (Dunedin), University of Canterbury (Christchurch), University of Auckland (Auckland), Victoria University of Wellington (Wellington), Canterbury Agricultural College (Lincoln) and Massey Agricultural College (Palmerston North). 

==History==
The University of New Zealand Act set up the university in 1870. At that time, the system&#x27;s headquarters was in Christchurch, Canterbury Province.

The University of Otago negotiated to keep its title of &quot;university&quot; when it joined the University of New Zealand in 1874, but it agreed to award degrees of the University of New Zealand. The colleges in Christchurch, Auckland and Wellington were known as &quot;university colleges&quot; rather than &quot;universities&quot; throughout most of the history of the University of New Zealand.

The Universities Act of 1961 dissolved the university and granted degree-conferring powers to the former constituent colleges. The New Zealand Vice-Chancellors&#x27; Committee assumed certain administrative functions exercised by the University Grants Committee which in turn assumed some functions of the University of New Zealand on its demise.&lt;br&gt;

==Entrance to the university==
The university set its own entrance examination and awarded scholarships to provide financial assistance for students. When the university was dissolved matters concerning entrance to New Zealand universities became the responsibility of the Universities Entrance Board, a subcommittee of the University Grants Committee. The Universities Entrance Board was in turn merged into the New Zealand Qualifications Authority in 1990.

==Other use of the name==
Te Wānanga o Aotearoa, founded in 1984, used &quot;The University of New Zealand&quot; as an English translation of its name, although it had no connection with the former university. After objections from bodies such as the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors&#x27; Committee (the heads of the universities) and the Ministry of Education over illegal use of a protected word (in this case, &quot;university&quot;) and thus possibly misleading advertising, the effective co-branding of the wānanga was phased out. The institution is now formally registered as a &quot;wānanga&quot;, one of five types of Crown-owned tertiary institutions under New Zealand law, the others being universities, colleges of education, specialist colleges and polytechnics.

<text>Michael Owen Johanns ( ; born June 18, 1950) is an American attorney and politician who served as a United States senator from Nebraska from 2009 to 2015. He served as the 38th governor of Nebraska from 1999 until 2005, and was chair of the Midwestern Governors Association in 2002. In 2005, he was appointed by President George W. Bush to serve as the secretary of agriculture, where he served from 2005 to 2007, becoming the fourth Nebraskan to hold that position.

Born in Osage, Iowa, Johanns is the graduate of Saint Mary&#x27;s University of Minnesota and Creighton University School of Law. He began his career as an attorney working in private practice before clerking for the Nebraska Supreme Court. Elected to the Lancaster County Board as a Democrat in 1983, Johanns served there until 1987, and was elected to the Lincoln City Council in 1988. He was elected the 47th mayor of Lincoln in 1991 and reelected in 1995.

In Nebraska&#x27;s 1998 gubernatorial election, Johanns defeated Democratic political aide Bill Hoppner, and in 2002 he was reelected over insurance executive Stormy Dean. In 2008, Johanns ran for the Republican nomination to replace retiring U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel. He won the primary, defeating businessman Pat Flynn, and the general election, defeating Democratic challenger Scott Kleeb. He was sworn in on January 3, 2009; along with Jim Risch of Idaho, he became only one of two new Republican senators sworn into the 111th United States Congress. On February 18, 2013, Johanns announced that he would not run for reelection to a second term in 2014, and was succeeded by fellow Republican Ben Sasse.

==Early life, education and legal career==
Johanns was born in Osage, Iowa, the son of Adeline Lucy (née Royek) and John Robert Johanns. His father was of German and some Luxembourgish ancestry, and his maternal grandparents immigrated from Poland. He grew up living and working on his family&#x27;s farm.

He graduated from Osage Community High School in 1968 and went on to study at Saint Mary&#x27;s University of Minnesota in Winona, where he received his Bachelor of Arts in Communications in 1971. Johanns earned his Juris Doctor from Creighton University School of Law, and joined the Nebraska State Bar Association in 1974.

After his graduation, he clerked for Nebraska Supreme Court Judge Hale McCown from 1974 to 1975, before practicing law for Cronin and Hannon in O&#x27;Neill, Nebraska from 1975 to 1976. He was a partner at Nelson, Johanns, Morris, Holdeman, and Titus, a law firm he founded in Lincoln, Nebraska in 1976, where he practiced until 1991.

==Early political career==
Johanns served on the Lancaster County Board from 1983 to 1987 as a Democrat. In 1988, he was elected as a Republican to the Lincoln City Council, where he served from 1989 to 1991. On May 7, 1991, he was elected the 47th Mayor of Lincoln, defeating incumbent Mayor Bill Harris, with 54% of the vote. He took office as Mayor on May 20, 1991. In 1995, Johanns won reelection with no opposition, becoming the first Mayor of Lincoln to do so since the 1950s. After being elected governor of Nebraska, he was succeeded as mayor by Dale Young, who was appointed by the Lincoln City Council.

==Governor of Nebraska==
===Elections===
====1998====
Johanns began campaigning early in Nebraska&#x27;s 1998 gubernatorial election, holding his first campaign event in October 1995. The early start led to a slow, steady build-up in name recognition and organizational support, and an advantage of small donors over his Republican opponents, Nebraska State Auditor John Breslow and U.S. Representative Jon Lynn Christensen. Johanns visited all of Nebraska&#x27;s 93 counties, traveling over 100,000 miles. Christensen, a two-term representative who promised not to serve more than three terms in the House, was seen as a surprise candidate in the gubernatorial election, as he had to give up his seat on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. Christensen (who saw backing from the Christian right), and Breslow ran their campaigns on a staunch social conservative message and were seen as trying to &quot;outconservative&quot; and outdistance one another, while Johanns was seen as an attractive candidate for moderate voters.

Christensen was seen as the early frontrunner, though his lead fell dramatically in the final weeks after he made public comments that he signed an affidavit after he and his first wife divorced, saying that her adultery broke up their marriage. He also saw backlash from comments he made about his second wife (Tara Dawn Holland, Miss America 1997), that he got her to swear that she was a virgin who was &quot;saving herself for marriage.&quot; His campaign also vigorously attacked Johanns in a flier for allowing &quot;obscene and racist&quot; broadcasts to air on Lincoln&#x27;s public access cable channel. The broadcasts showed a man urinating in public; though Johanns tried to stop the program, the airing was protected by a federal lawsuit. The flier was condemned by Republican members of Nebraska&#x27;s congressional delegation, with then-Senator Chuck Hagel saying that &quot;Nobody in the Republican Party of Nebraska can be proud of Jon Christensen&#x27;s conduct. I hope the people of the state will get out and vote and register their feelings on the conduct of this campaign.&quot; Hagel also added that his tactics &quot;embarrassed Nebraska.&quot;

Though the race was seen as a &quot;dead heat&quot; the day before the primary, Johanns won with 40% of the vote, to Breslow&#x27;s 29% and Christensen&#x27;s 28%. The primary was seen as one of the most expensive in Nebraska history, with Breslow spending $3.8 million ($2.5 million of his own money), Christensen spending $1.8 million and Johanns spending $1.7 million.

Incumbent Ben Nelson, a popular Democrat in the staunchly red state, was term-limited after serving two terms as governor, leaving the Democratic field open. Bill Hoppner won the Democratic nomination, defeating lawyer and former member of the Nebraska Legislature Jim McFarland. Hoppner, an attorney who previously served as the chief of staff to senators J. James Exon and Bob Kerrey, had never won an election before; he had run for governor and was defeated by Nelson in the 1990 primary.

On November 3, 1998, Johanns and his running mate, David I. Maurstad, defeated Hoppner and his running mate, Pam Bataillon, in the general election, by a margin of 54% to 46%.

====2002====
Johanns won reelection in 2002 by a landslide, defeating Democrat Stormy Dean by a margin of 69% to 27%, thus becoming the first Republican governor of Nebraska to be reelected since Victor E. Anderson in 1956.

===Tenure===

During his first term, Johanns focused on direct property tax relief. He succeeded in enacting a total of $85 million in such relief.

Johanns was a supporter of Initiative 413, amending Nebraska&#x27;s constitution to limit state government spending, and adjusting tax revenue increases to the rate of inflation. In 2002 Johanns signed legislation raising the state&#x27;s cigarette tax by 50 cents per pack; from 34 to 84 cents. Johanns proposed another 20 cents increase in cigarette taxes, saying that &quot;I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to get much debate that medical costs are higher when you smoke. Cigarette and tobacco use may be a choice, but every one of us pays for its use, either with our health or our pocketbooks, or both.&quot;

Johanns led agriculture trade missions to Japan, China, Taiwan, Australia, South Korea and Brazil. He signed legislation increasing state gasoline taxes by 1.25 cents for ethanol incentive funding, raising $1.5 million annually for Nebraska&#x27;s Ethanol Production Incentive Cash Fund. Johanns served as the chairman of Governors&#x27; Ethanol Coalition in 2001.

Johanns was known for his strong stance on vetoing bills. In 1999 Johanns vetoed 26 bills in only five days, more than any previous governor in Nebraska history. In 2003 Johanns vetoed the entire $5.4 billion two-year Nebraska state budget. He said that he &quot;could not accept a budget that raised taxes to grow government at a time when the state must cut spending,&quot; and called for a nearly 10% cut in every state government program. Johanns vetoed legislation increasing the pay of members of the Nebraska Legislature, though the veto was overridden by the legislature; he also vetoed legislation authorizing teacher salary increases.

During the 1999 legislative session, the Nebraska Legislature passed a moratorium of executions in a 27 to 21 vote, becoming the first state in the nation to send such a proposal to the governor&#x27;s desk. The bill set bans on all executions for two years, while a study to see if the death penalty was being applied fairly in the state took place. Though the bill prevented executions from taking place, it did not exempt the sentencing of the death penalty in new cases. Johanns, who is a proponent of the capital punishment, vetoed the bill a week after its passage; calling the bill &quot;poor public policy&quot; that would &quot;at a minimum be utilized to advance further unnecessary criminal appeals by those currently sentenced to death row in Nebraska.&quot; The veto of the bill was condemned by the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Bar Association and Pope John Paul II.

In 1999, Johanns saw criticism from the groups People For the American Way and the American Civil Liberties Union for signing a proclamation declaring May 22, &quot;March for Jesus Day,&quot; in honor of a fundamentalist Christian group in Nebraska. Critiques said that Johanns was &quot;violating the neutrality of religions that is required of his office. He was endorsing Christianity over all other religions, sending an impermissible message to Nebraskans of other faiths or of no faith that their beliefs are disfavored by the Government.&quot; Johanns also endorsed &quot;Back to the Bible Day,&quot; though he refused to issue a proclamation for Earth Religion Awareness Day, a day requested by Wicca groups. Johanns said that &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to sign a proclamation for the Jewish faith, Hinduism, whatever. So long as it doesn&#x27;t require me to sign something I personally don&#x27;t agree with.&quot; Johanns previously refused to sign a proclamation for LGBT Pride in 1997, citing his Christianity.

Johanns twice served as the chair of the National Governors Association&#x27;s Committee on Economic Development and Commerce from 2000 to 2001 and from 2002 to 2003. In July 2001, he was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank of the United States to serve on the banks Advisory Committee, and in 2003 served as the chairman of the Governor&#x27;s Biotechnology Partnership.

Johanns succeeded Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack as chair of the Midwestern Governors Association in 2002.

==United States Secretary of Agriculture==

On December 2, 2004, Johanns was nominated by President George W. Bush to replace outgoing Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman. As a result, he scrapped plans to run against Democratic U.S. Senator Ben Nelson (his predecessor as governor) in the 2006 election. In his announcement nominating Johanns as agriculture secretary, President Bush explained that he chose him to replace Veneman for his support of ethanol and biodiesel and for his knowledge in foreign trade; calling him &quot;a man of action and of complete integrity.&quot; Johanns was confirmed in a voice vote by the Senate on January 20, 2005, hours after Bush&#x27;s second inauguration. He tendered his resignation as Governor of Nebraska on that day, and was sworn in the next day.

The Department of Agriculture under Johanns received criticism for being too slow to perform additional tests on cows suspected of having mad cow disease.

==U.S. Senate==
===2008 election===

On September 20, 2007, Johanns resigned as the Secretary of Agriculture and announced on October 10, 2007 that he would run for the United States Senate seat vacated by Senator Chuck Hagel. On November 4, 2008, he was elected to the United States Senate, defeating Democratic nominee Scott Kleeb in the general election.

===Tenure===
Johanns&#x27; time in the Senate was low-key: he never appeared on one of the Sunday morning talk shows. He voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and opposed cap-and-trade legislation. He was a member of the &quot;Gang of Eight&quot; that tried to negotiate a federal deficit reduction deal in 2011 and was pivotal in re-routing the proposed route of the Keystone Pipeline.

Johanns received an award from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society for his work to support funding for autoimmune disease research.

==Millennium Challenge Corporation==

In December 2015, President Barack Obama nominated Johanns to be a member of the board of directors of the Millennium Challenge Corporation. This nomination was confirmed by a voice vote of the U.S. Senate in February 2016. In March 2019, President Donald Trump nominated him for a second term on the board.

==Personal life==
Johanns married his first wife, Connie Johanns, in 1972. They had two children together: a son, Justin and a daughter, Michaela. He also has five grandchildren. Johanns and his wife divorced in 1985, and in 1986 he married Stephanie Armitage, a former Lancaster County Commissioner and Nebraska state senator.

<text>The United States Revenue Cutter Service was established by an act of Congress () on 4 August 1790 as the Revenue-Marine upon the recommendation of Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton to serve as an armed customs enforcement service. As time passed, the service gradually gained missions either voluntarily or by legislation, including those of a military nature. It was generally referred to as the Revenue-Marine until 31 July 1894, when it was officially renamed the Revenue Cutter Service. The Revenue Cutter Service operated under the authority of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. On 28 January 1915, the service was merged by an act of Congress with the United States Life-Saving Service to form the United States Coast Guard.

==Background and establishment==
Immediately after the American Revolutionary War the new United States struggled financially. The federal government desperately needed revenue, and determined to raise it chiefly from tariffs on imports. Strong enforcement of tariff laws could blunt rampant smuggling. Urged on by Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, the United States Congress on 4 August 1790 established the Revenue-Marine, later renamed the Revenue Cutter Service by act of 31 July 1894 (28 Stat. 171).

A cutter vessel is a small or medium-sized boat or sailing ship, built for speed and with a shallow draft. While some larger cutters had two or three masts, many cutters had only one, located more centrally on the ship than was typical of larger vessels. In modern times, any naval ship built for speed and agility is still referred to as a cutter.

The Revenue-Marine&#x27;s enabling legislation required ten vessels built for a &quot;System of Cutters&quot;. Two cutters were to be assigned to &quot;the coasts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire; one for Long Island Sound; one for New York; one for the Bay of Delaware; two for the Chesapeake (these of course to ply along the neighboring coasts); one for North Carolina; and one for Georgia&quot;. On 21 March 1791 President George Washington commissioned the first seven masters. Among those commissioned were Hopley Yeaton and John Foster Williams of Massachusetts, Jonathan Maltbie of Connecticut, Patrick Dennis of New York, James Montgomery of Pennsylvania, Simon Gross of Maryland, and Richard Taylor of Virginia. William Cooke of North Carolina was commissioned on 25 April 1791, Robert Cochrane of South Carolina on 8 May 1791, and 20 May 1791 John Howell of Georgia. Each cutter was constructed where it was to be assigned; a move by Hamilton to satisfy members of Congress and gain their votes for the establishment of the service. Washington suggested to Hamilton that it would be advantageous to have each master supervise the construction of his own cutter; a suggestion that Hamilton put into use along with a limitation that each cutter cost no more than 1,000 . Hamilton&#x27;s cost restrictions proved unrealistic for three of the new cutters; cost 2,050, cost 1,255, and cost over 1,500.

The same legislation that established the ten original cutters also provided for the complement and pay scales of the crew of each vessel. Each vessel was provided with a master with pay set at $30 per month and three mates at $20, $16, and $14, respectively. In addition each cutter was allowed four mariners at $8 apiece and two boys at $4.

==History==
===Early missions===
Between 1790 and 1798, the Revenue-Marine was the only armed maritime service of the United States, as the Navy had been disbanded. Each cutter master was answerable to and received his sailing orders directly from the Collector of Customs of the port to which his ship was assigned. All crew pay, requests for supplies, arrangements for repairs to the cutter, and mission-specific tasking came directly from the port&#x27;s Customs House. After the Slave Trade Act of 1794 was enacted, the Revenue-Marine began intercepting slave ships which were illegally importing slaves into the United States.

This was the case from 1791 to 1871, except for the period 1843–49, when oversight was vested in the Revenue Marine Division of the Treasury Department. Standing orders for individual cutters were stated in general terms, allowing captains to exercise their discretion and judgment to the fullest. Captains also had far-reaching authority &quot;to seize vessels and goods in the cases in which they are liable to seizure for breaches of the Revenue laws&quot; and to send inspection parties aboard vessels already in port to ensure that cargo intended for export also did not violate revenue laws. Yet despite this considerable authority, Alexander Hamilton, in his first letter of instruction to the captains, had specifically directed that they &quot;will always keep in mind that their countrymen are freemen, and, as such, are impatient of everything that bears the least mark of a domineering spirit. ... They will endeavor to overcome difficulties, if any are experienced, by a cool and temperate perseverance in their duty – by address and moderation, rather than by vehemence or violence.&quot;

===Quasi-War with France===

During the Quasi-War with France from 1798 to 1801, the United States Navy was formed and the Revenue-Marine fought alongside the Navy, capturing or assisting in the capture of 20 French ships. Ten of these were captured by the USRC &quot;Pickering&quot;.
Revenue cutters were assigned to enforce the very unpopular Embargo Act of 1807, which outlawed nearly all European trade, import and export, through American ports. The Act was enforced until it was repealed in 1808.

===The War of 1812===
In wartime, the Revenue Marine was placed under the command of the U.S. Navy, and the cutters themselves were often placed into military service. made the first American capture of an enemy ship in the War of 1812, the brig &quot;Patriot&quot;, in June 1812.

On 3 August 1812, the boats of the British frigates and captured the 6-gun revenue cutter in the Little River, Bay of Fundy, together with three privateer schooners, &quot;Madison&quot;, &quot;Olive&quot;, and &quot;Spence&quot; (or &quot;Spruce&quot;).

Then on 22 August 1812, , under the command of Captain Thomas Huskisson, captured the USRC &quot;James Madison&quot; after a chase of seven hours. The cutter was pierced for fourteen guns but had only ten mounted, two of which she threw overboard to lighten her during the chase. She had a crew of 65 men and was seven days out of Savannah, but had made no captures. Huskisson described her: &quot;[She is] coppered and copper-fastened, is two years old, and sails remarkably fast.&quot;

On the night of 12 June 1813, the small cutter &quot;Surveyor&quot;, with a crew of 16 and an armament of only six carronades, was anchored in the York River (Virginia), when a 90-man boarding party from the frigate attacked her. The attack came from an angle at which &quot;Surveyor&quot; could not use her carronades. However, the Revenue Marine seamen, under Captain William S. Travis, each was armed with two muskets and held their fire until the British boats were upon them. After a fierce hand-to-hand fight that left five Americans wounded and three British dead and five wounded, the British succeeded in taking &quot;Surveyor&quot;. Lieutenant Cririe, first lieutenant of &quot;Narcissus&quot; and commander of the boats, returned Captain Travis&#x27;s sword to him—an unusual gesture of respect—for his &quot;gallant defense&quot; of &quot;Surveyor&quot;.

On 11 October 1814, the cutter &quot;Eagle&quot; encountered &quot;Narcissus&quot;, and the , which was guarding the &quot;Suzan&quot;, a captured American merchant ship. The British ship badly outgunned &quot;Eagle&quot;, which was pierced for 10 guns but only had two mounted. Captain Frederick Lee beached &quot;Eagle&quot; on Long Island to avoid being sunk. Not yet defeated, the Revenue Marine seamen removed the guns from &quot;Eagle&quot;, hoisted them up a 160-foot bluff, dragged them into position, and continued firing at &quot;Dispatch&quot;. The British sent in boats to capture &quot;Eagle&quot;. When the Americans ran out of cannonballs, they still did not surrender, instead retrieving the cannonballs fired at them by &quot;Dispatch&quot; and shooting them back. Even after being forced to use the ship&#x27;s logbook for wadding, the crew, together with local militia, continued to fight. Eventually, the British retrieved &quot;Eagle&quot; and took her away.

===Counter-piracy operations===
After the War of 1812, British and Spanish sea power in the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico weakened, allowing a resurgence of piracy along the Gulf Coast. The West Indies anti-piracy operations of the United States revenue cutters were dispatched to fight the pirates. In 1819, the one-gun schooners USRC &quot;Alabama&quot; and USRC &quot;Louisiana&quot; fought two engagements with pirates, one on the open sea and another at Breton Island, Louisiana. On 19 July 1820, &quot;Alabama&quot; captured four pirate ships off La Balize. In 1822, with USS &quot;Peacock&quot; and HMS &quot;Speedwell&quot;, &quot;Alabama&quot; engaged pirates again, which resulted in the taking of five more pirate ships.
In 1832, Secretary of the Treasury Louis McLane issued written orders for revenue cutters to conduct winter cruises to assist mariners in need, and Congress made the practice an official part of regulations in 1837. This was the beginning of the life-saving mission for which the later United States Coast Guard would be best known worldwide.

===Mexican–American War===
Revenue-Marine cutters again served under the U.S. Navy in the Mexican–American War of 1846–1848. The cutters were crucial for shallow-water amphibious assaults.
===American Civil War===

On 11 April 1861, the USRC &quot;Harriet Lane&quot; fired the first shot of the maritime conflict in the American Civil War of 1861–1865. The cutter fired a shot across the bow of the civilian mail steamship &quot;Nashville&quot; as it tried to enter Charleston Harbor during the bombardment of Fort Sumter because &quot;Nashville&quot; was flying no identifying flag. The ship then promptly raised the U.S. standard, and &quot;Harriet Lane&quot; broke off. Captain John Faunce, skipper of &quot;Harriet Lane&quot;, gave permission for &quot;Nashville&quot; to proceed to Charleston harbor and she was promptly seized by the Confederate Navy.

President Abraham Lincoln issued the following order to Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase on 14 June 1863: &quot;You will co-operate by the revenue cutters under your direction with the navy in arresting rebel depredations on American commerce and transportation and in capturing rebels engaged therein.&quot;
Revenue cutters assisted U.S. Navy operations throughout the war. &quot;Harriet Lane&quot; joined a federal naval squadron to capture Fort Clark and Fort Hatteras, which served as bases for Confederate blockade runners. USRC &quot;E.A. Stevens&quot;, a prototype 110-foot semi-submersible ironclad gunboat, in company with USS &quot;Monitor&quot;, USS &quot;Galena&quot;, and two other gunboats, participated in the unsuccessful sortie up the James River to Drewry&#x27;s Bluff to attack the Confederate capital at Richmond. After carrying President Lincoln from Washington on 9 May 1862, USRC &quot;Miami&quot; assisted navy transports in landing federal troops at Ocean View, Virginia.

In June 1863, in an incident known as the &quot;Battle of Portland Harbor&quot;, the revenue cutter &quot;Caleb Cushing&quot; was captured by Confederate raiders, commanded by Lieutenant Charles Read, CSN, from the CSS &quot;Tacony&quot;. The &quot;Cushing&quot; was pursued by two civilian ships carrying a detachment of soldiers from Fort Preble and a number of civilian volunteers. Seeing that capture was imminent, the Confederates abandoned the &quot;Cushing&quot; in a lifeboat after setting her on fire. The Confederates were captured but the &quot;Cushing&quot; was destroyed when the gunpowder on the ship detonated.

After President Lincoln was assassinated on 15 April 1865, revenue cutters were ordered to search all ships for any conspirators who might be trying to escape.

===Post–Civil War operations===
The increase in coastal trade along the Atlantic seaboard after the civil war and the purchase of Alaska in 1867 had a significant impact on the development of the Revenue Cutter Service. Demands by the public to do something about losses in lives and property at sea prompted Secretary of the Treasury George S. Boutwell, under President Ulysses S. Grant, to reorganize the service. He appointed N. Broughton Devereux on 1 July 1869 as chief of an interim Revenue Marine Bureau that included the Revenue Cutter Service, the Steamboat Inspection Service, the Marine Hospital Service and the Life-Saving Service. Devereaux appointed two boards to study the problems facing the service; one investigated personnel requirements, the other analyzed the requirements for the cutter fleet.

The fleet board produced a study that was presented to Congress on 26 May 1870, the result of which was that of the twenty-four steaming cutters in the service, four were harbor tugs, six were stationed on the Great Lakes and the remaining steaming cutters were stationed in the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The harbor tugs were left where they were stationed and all of the lake cutters were recommended for repair and stayed located where they were except for one which was home-ported in a different city. All of the steaming coastal cutters except for two were a successful side-wheel design which were retained. The board recommended keeping only one of the propeller driven steam cutters, the USRC &quot;Mahoning&quot;. Of the twelve sail cutters in the fleet, only five of the most seaworthy were recommended by the board to be retained. Devereaux&#x27;s report to Congress included a request for four new steam cutters: a large propeller-driven ship, a large side-wheeler and two smaller side-wheelers. Recommendations were made as to the types of engines to be used on various cutters and all were to be equipped with sails to save on coal consumption. Additionally, Devereaux requested $125,000 to cover the unexpected costs of operating cutters &quot;Lincoln&quot;, &quot;Wayanda&quot; and &quot;Reliance&quot; in Alaskan waters during 1869.

The personnel board that Devereaux convened found that the Revenue Cutter Service was rife with abuses through the political control by customs collectors in the ports where the cutters were assigned. It was possible under the structure in place at the time to be appointed by the customs collector to the captaincy of a cutter without having ever served aboard a ship.

Although the Department of the Treasury remained in charge of the service throughout the 19th century, its conventional organization was resumed after the war, with cutters reporting to local customs officials. A new Revenue Marine Division was established in 1871, which became the United States Revenue Cutter Service by an act of 31 July 1894 (28 Stat. 171).

During the harsh winter of 1897–1898, Lieutenant David H. Jarvis of USRC &quot;Bear&quot; led a relief party to 265 whalers whose ships had been stranded in the ice off the northern coast of Alaska.

===Spanish–American War===

With the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in 1898, the Revenue Cutter Service saw plenty of action in both the Cuban and Philippine theaters. Many revenue cutters were assigned to the blockade of Havana Harbor. During the Battle of Manila Bay on 1 May 1898, USRC &quot;Hugh McCulloch&quot; fought with the American squadron under Commodore George Dewey.
On 11 May 1898, , equipped with two 6-pounder (3 kg) guns and a machine gun, took part in the Battle of Cárdenas off the coast of Cárdenas, Cuba. Together with Navy torpedo boat , &quot;Hudson&quot; fought against a Spanish gunboat and coastal batteries until forced to withdraw. Under extremely heavy fire, &quot;Hudson&quot; towed the disabled &quot;Winslow&quot; away from the battle. Congress awarded Frank H. Newcomb, the captain of &quot;Hudson&quot;, a Congressional Gold Medal for his bravery. Each of the officers assigned to &quot;Hudson&quot; received a silver medal and the enlisted crew received a bronze medal.

==Officer rank structure==
From the establishment of the Revenue Cutter Service in 1790 until 1799 the officers of the service were called &quot;master&quot; and &quot;mate&quot;; the same terms for officers used on merchant ships. Initially, the masters and mates were commissioned &quot;officers of the customs&quot; under the act, rather than commissioned military officers. The system of cutters authorized by Congress in the 1790 act authorized 10 cutters to be constructed. Each cutter was to be crewed by the master, first, second, and third mates as well as four &quot;mariners&quot; and two &quot;boys&quot; Congress established a military rank structure for the Revenue Cutter Service in a 2 March 1799 act which authorized the use of the terms &quot;captain&quot; and &quot;lieutenant&quot;.

The ranks of officers in the Revenue Cutter Service, and later the U.S. Coast Guard, were not made comparable to Navy ranks until 1922. However Navy officers started to complain in 1834 when Revenue Cutter officer&#x27;s uniforms started to resemble Navy uniforms.

In 1908, Congress established the rank of &quot;captain-commandant&quot; equal to the rank of a U.S. Navy captain and also the rank of &quot;senior captain&quot; equal to a commander. The position of &quot;chief engineer&quot; was established ranking with that of senior captain.

==Formation of the U.S. Coast Guard==
President Woodrow Wilson signed into law the Coast Guard Act on 28 January 1915. This act combined the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service with the United States Life-Saving Service to form the new United States Coast Guard. The U.S. Coast Guard assumed the responsibilities of the United States Lighthouse Service in 1939 and the Navigation and Steamboat Inspection Service in 1942.

In 1990, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Paul A. Yost Jr. established a military award known as the Coast Guard Bicentennial Unit Commendation, which commemorated the original founding of the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service.

<doc id="426235" wikidata="Q10566065" url="?curid=426235" title="Maryland General Assembly">
<text>The Maryland General Assembly is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Maryland that convenes within the State House in Annapolis. It is a bicameral body: the upper chamber, the Maryland Senate, has 47 representatives, and the lower chamber, the Maryland House of Delegates, has 141 representatives. Members of both houses serve four-year terms. Each house elects its own officers, judges the qualifications and election of its own members, establishes rules for the conduct of its business, and may punish or expel its own members.

The General Assembly convenes its legislative session for 90 days each year to act on more than 2,300 bills including the state&#x27;s annual budget, which it must pass before adjourning &quot;sine die&quot;. The General Assembly&#x27;s 446th session convened on January 10, 2024.

==History==
The forerunner of the Maryland General Assembly was the colonial institution, an Assembly of Free Marylanders (and also Council of Maryland).
Maryland&#x27;s foundational charter created a state ruled by the &quot;Palatine lord,&quot; Lord Baltimore. As ruler, Lord Baltimore owned directly all of the land granted in the charter, and possessed absolute authority over his domain.

However, as elsewhere in British North America, British political institutions were re-created in the colonies, and the Maryland General Assembly fulfilled much the same function as the House of Commons. An act was passed providing that:

from henceforth and for ever everyone being of the council of the Province and any other gentleman of able judgement summoned by writ (and the Lord of every Manor within this Province after Manors be erected) shall and may have his voice, seat, and place in every General Assembly ... together with two or more able and sufficient men for the hundred as the said freedmen or the major part of them ... shall think good.

In addition, the Lord Proprietor could summon any delegates whom he desired. In 1639, noting that Parliament had not been summoned in England for a decade, the free men of Maryland passed an act to the effect that &quot;assemblies were to be called once in every three years at the least&quot;, ensuring that their voices would be regularly heard. During the American Revolution the colonial Assembly ceased to exist, and was replaced by its modern successor.

Starting in 1867, the Assembly became increasingly unrepresentative. As the population of Baltimore increased, it and other urban areas were not granted additional seats. By 1918, the city&#x27;s population had increased 175% while the entire state gained only 46% with no reallocation of political power. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the General Assembly adjourned early on March 18, 2020, for the first time since the Civil War.

==Qualifications and membership==
Each senator or delegate must be a U.S. citizen and a resident of Maryland for at least one year preceding his or her election. A prospective legislator must have resided in the legislative district the candidate seeks to represent for the six months prior to election. A senator must be at least twenty-five years of age at the time of election and a delegate at least twenty-one. Military officers other than members of the reserves are not eligible for election to the General Assembly.

Each term lasts four years. However, members of the General Assembly are not term-limited. If a vacancy occurs in either house through death, resignation, or disqualification, the Governor of Maryland appoints a replacement whose name is submitted by the State Central Committee of the same political party as the legislator whose seat is to be filled.

==Legislative districts==
The current pattern for distribution of seats began with the legislative apportionment plan of 1972 and has been revised every ten years thereafter according to the results of the decennial U.S. Census. A Constitutional amendment, the plan created 47 legislative districts, many of which cross county boundaries to delineate districts relatively equal in population. Each legislative district elects one senator and three delegates. In most districts, the three delegates are elected at large from the whole district via block voting. However, in some more sparsely populated areas of the state, the districts are divided into subdistricts for the election of delegates: either into three one-delegate subdistricts or one two-delegate subdistrict and one one-delegate subdistrict.

==Leadership==
The Senate is led by a President and the House by a Speaker whose respective duties and prerogatives enable them to influence the legislative process significantly. The President and the Speaker appoint the members of most committees and name their chairs and vice-chairs, except in the case of the Joint Committee on Investigation whose members elect their own officers. The President and Speaker preside over the daily sessions of their respective chambers, maintaining decorum and deciding points of order. As legislation is introduced, they assign it to a standing committee for consideration and a public hearing. The president pro tempore appoints majority and minority whips and leaders.

== Overview of legislative procedure ==
A bill is a proposal to change, repeal, or add to existing state law. A House Bill (HB) is one introduced in the House of Delegates (for example: HB 6); a Senate Bill (SB), in the Senate.

Bills are designated by number, in the order of introduction in each house. For example, HB 16 refers to the sixteenth bill introduced in the House of Delegates. The numbering starts afresh each session. The names of the sponsor (and co-sponsors, if any), the legislator who introduced the bill, becomes part of the title. Bills listed as &quot;The Speaker (By Request of Administration)&quot;, &quot;The President (By Request of Administration)&quot;, &quot;Minority Leader (By Request of Administration)&quot;, or &quot;Committee Chair (By Request of Department)&quot; are bills proposed by the Governor and his agencies and are not proposals of the Speaker of the House, the President of the Senate, the Minority Leader, or the respective Committee Chair. They are listed with the official title of a legislator rather than the Governor due to requirements in the Maryland Constitution.

The legislative procedure, is divided into distinct stages:
*. The procedure begins when a Senator or Delegate decides to author a bill. A legislator sends the idea for the bill to the Department of Legislative Services&#x27; bill drafting division, where it is drafted into bill form. The draft of the bill is returned to the legislator for introduction.
*Introduction or First Reading. A bill is introduced or read the first time when the bill number, the name of the sponsor, and the descriptive title of the bill are read on the floor of the house.
*Committee hearing. After introduction, a bill is assigned to the appropriate policy committee, appropriate to the subject matter, for its first hearing. Notice of the hearing is published in the Maryland Register to allow for public comment. During the committee hearing the sponsor presents the bill to the committee, and testimony may be heard in support or opposition to the bill from any member of the public. The committee then votes on whether to pass the bill out of committee, or that it be passed as amended. Bills may be amended several times. It takes a majority vote of the committee membership for a bill to be passed and sent to the next committee or to the floor.
*Second reading. A bill recommended for passage by committee is read a second time on the floor of the house. Legislators, not on the committee where the bill received its public hearing, may only offer amendments to the bill at this stage. House bills in the Senate may be amended by senators on second or third reading and Senate bills in the House may also be amended on second or third reading. After all amendments are considered, the presiding officer orders the bill to be printed for third reading. This printing would include any committee or floor amendments.
* Third reading. A roll call vote is taken. An ordinary bill needs a majority vote to pass. An emergency bill requires a three-fifths vote, and a bill requiring the Maryland Constitution to be amended requires a three-fifths vote.
* Second house. If the bill receives a constitutional majority from the first house, the bill repeats the same steps in the other house. If the second house passes the bill without changing it, it is sent to the governor&#x27;s desk.
* Resolution of Differences (concurrence or conference). If a measure is amended in the second house and passed, it is returned to the house of origin for consideration of amendments. The house of origin may concur with the amendments and send the bill to the governor or reject the amendments and submit it to a two-house conference committee. Appointed by the Senate President and the House Speaker, a conference committee consists of three members of each house. The committee sends a report of its recommendations to each chamber which then can adopt or reject it. If the report is adopted, the bill is voted upon for final passage in each house. If the report is rejected by either house, the bill fails.

* Governor&#x27;s action. All passed bills, except the budget bill and constitutional amendments, must be presented to the Governor within twenty days following adjournment of a session. The Governor may veto bills within thirty days after presentation. If a passed bill is not vetoed, it becomes law. The budget bill, however, becomes law upon its final passage and cannot be vetoed. Constitutional amendments also cannot be vetoed; they become law only upon their ratification by the voters at the next general election.
* Veto overrides. A vetoed bill is returned to the house of origin, where a vote may be taken to override the governor&#x27;s veto; a three-fifths vote of both houses is required to override a veto.
* Effective date. Each bill that is passed by the Legislature and approved by the Governor is assigned a chapter number by the Secretary of State. These chaptered bills are statutes, and ordinarily become part of Maryland law. Ordinarily a law passed during a regular session takes effect October 1 of the same year. Emergency bills go into effect as soon as the governor signs them; these include acts calling for special elections and emergency measures necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety.

<text>The Delaware General Assembly is the legislature of the U.S. state of Delaware. It is a bicameral legislature composed of the Delaware Senate with 21 senators and the Delaware House of Representatives with 41 representatives. It meets at Legislative Hall in Dover, convening on the second Tuesday of January of odd-numbered years, with a second session of the same Assembly convening likewise in even-numbered years. Normally the sessions are required to adjourn by the last day of June of the same calendar year. However the Governor can call a special session of the legislature at any time.

Members are elected from single-member districts, all apportioned to roughly equal populations after each decennial Census. Elections are held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November and approximately half of the Senate is elected every two years to a four-year term, and the entire House of Representatives is elected every two years to a two-year term. Vacancies are filled through special elections. There are no term limits for either chamber.

With 62 seats, the Delaware General Assembly is the second-smallest bicameral state legislature in the United States – ahead of Alaska (60 seats) and behind Nevada (63).

== History ==
The Delaware General Assembly was one of the thirteen legislatures that participated in the American War of Independence. Created by the Delaware Constitution of 1776, its membership and responsibilities have been modified by the Delaware Constitution of 1792, the Delaware Constitution of 1831, the Delaware Constitution of 1897, and Supreme Court of the United States decision in &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; in 1965.

Significant actions of the General Assembly include the calling of the constitutional convention which became the first to ratify the United States Constitution in 1787 (which led to Delaware&#x27;s state nickname, &quot;the First State&quot;), and its rejection of secession from the Union on January 3, 1861, even though Delaware was a slave state. Also significant was its repeated refusal to legislate the end of slavery or voting rights for women, requiring federal law to enforce those changes.

Until 1898, the General Assembly was apportioned by county: a total of 30 members elected at-large by county with equal numbers from each of the three counties. After 1898, the total membership was increased to 52 and they were elected from districts, mostly corresponding to the geographical boundaries of hundreds within the counties. However, there was little recognition of disparities in population, except for the addition of two extra senators and five extra representatives elected from much more populous New Castle County. After the Supreme Court decision in &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; in 1965, the General Assembly was forced to redistrict so that all members of both houses were elected from districts of equal population. By 1972, the total membership had increased to its present 62.

In 1924, Florence Wood Hanby became the first woman elected to the Delaware General Assembly, winning a seat in the Delaware House of Representatives.

It is the only legislature with the power to unilaterally amend its constitution without requiring a referendum or any other approval.

<text>Azuaga () is a town located in the province of Badajoz in southern Extremadura, bordering the Andalusian provinces of Seville and Córdoba in Spain. Azuga is 140 km from Badajoz, 125 km from Córdoba, and 140 km from Seville, in the foothills of Sierra Morena in the frontier region of Campiña Sur.

With a surface area of 498 km2, Azuaga is the fourth largest municipality by area in the province of Badajoz and includes the village of the Cardenchosa. The inhabitants in 2010 were 8303.

==History==
===Ancient era===
Azuaga has archeological remains from the Megalithic era, the Copper Age, Bronze Age, and also from the Orientalizing Period.

In the period of the Roman Empire, Azuaga was part of the province of Lusitania, known variously as &quot;Municipium Flavium Ugultuniacum&quot;, &quot;Municipium Iulium V&quot;, or &quot;Julia Flavia&quot;. Its inhabitants were of the Galeria tribe (Latin &quot;tribu Galeria&quot;). Local remains from the era include two stone tablets with inscriptions.

There are few remains from the Visigothic era.

===Middle Ages===
When Spain fell into Moorish hands, Azuaga underwent a period of growth. Among the historical evidence of Moorish Azuaga, the Muslim geographer and traveler Al Idrisi mentions the settlement in the 12th century, alluding to it as a hilltop fort - (حِصْن زُوَاغَة - HiSn Zuwāghah). This is the first writing that mentions Azuaga by name. It would appear that at that time the people of Azuaga were of the Berber tribe &quot;Al-Zuwaga&quot;, hence the name. Azuaga still has a surviving portion of its 11th-century castle.

In 1236 Azuaga was conquered by the Christian kingdoms of Castile, during the reign of Ferdinand III, by the Order of Santiago, directed at that time by Pelay Pérez Correa. The Christian captured the castle and constructed the new Torre del Homenaje (&quot;Tower of Homage&quot;), the best conserved portion of the castle today.

In 1477, in the Ermita (Hermitage) de San Sebastián (later the Convento de La Merced [Mercy], then the Ermita de La Merced), the Order de Santiago held a general chapter meeting and selected Don Alonso de Cárdenas as its new master.

===Modern era===
In the first census of Extremadura in 1551, Azuaga was the largest population center in Extremadura. In 18th century censuses, Azuaga appears as one of the principal towns of the region. It dominated the region in artisanal and manufacturing activity, most prominently in textiles and dyes.

Azuagueños artist Juan del Castillo (1585–1658) did his major work in Seville, where he was the maestro of an . His brother Agustín del Castillo (1590–1626) painted in Córdoba.

In the 16th century, two different clerics were known by the same name, Fray Pedro de Azuaga. One was an important Franciscan theorist, permanent counsellor to Philip II. The other, active in the last third of the century rose steadily through the ecclesiastical ranks, ultimately becoming Bishop of Chile in 1596.

During the colonial era, Azuaga ranked seventh in Extremadura in the number of people who went to the Americas. This is more significant than it might at first sound, because Extremadura was a major force in the conquest of the Americas.

In the nineteenth century and the early twentieth century, Azuaga was more or less eclipsed. Between 1920 and 1960, Azuaga experienced major activity in mining lead and (to a lesser degree) silver, which brought renewed prosperity to the region, fluctuating between 16,000 and 18,000 inhabitants, but after that the population fell off rapidly as workers migrated elsewhere, nearly half of the town&#x27;s population departing. An identifiable group of azuagueños emigrated to Sant Boi de Llobregat (Barcelona).

<doc id="426241" wikidata="Q1095676" url="?curid=426241" title="Clark Air Base">
<text>Clark Air Base is a Philippine Air Force base in Luzon, located west of Angeles City, and about northwest of Metro Manila. Clark Air Base was previously a United States military facility, operated by the U.S. Air Force under the aegis of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) and their predecessor organizations from 1903 to 1991. The base covered with a military reservation extending north that covered another .

The base was a stronghold of the combined Philippine and American forces during the final months of World War II, and a backbone of logistical support during the Vietnam War until 1975. Following the departure of American forces in 1991 due to the eruption of Mount Pinatubo and rejection by the Philippine Senate for renewing the presence of U.S. military bases in the Philippines, the base became the site of Clark International Airport, as well as the Clark Freeport Zone and the Air Force City of the Philippine Air Force.

In April 2016, an Air Contingent of USAF A-10s and HH-60s was deployed from U.S. air bases in Pyeongtaek and Okinawa to Clark. The Air Contingent included five A-10C Thunderbolt IIs from the 51st Fighter Wing, Osan AB, South Korea; three HH-60G Pave Hawks from the 18th Wing, Kadena AB, Japan; and approximately 200 personnel deployed from multiple Pacific Air Force units. The primary mission of the contingent appears to be to patrol disputed South China Sea islands, &quot;to provide greater and more transparent air and maritime domain awareness to ensure safety for military and civilian activities in international waters and airspace.&quot; The air contingent builds upon previous deployments by U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon aircraft to Clark.

==History==

Clark Air Base was originally established as Fort Stotsenburg in Sapang Bato, Angeles, Pampanga in 1903 under control of the U.S. Army. A portion of Fort Stotsenburg was officially set aside for the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps and named Clark Field in September 1919 after Harold M. Clark. Clark later served as a landing field for U.S. Army Air Corps medium bombers and accommodated half of the heavy bombers stationed in the Philippines during the 1930s. It was very large for an air field of its day, and in the late summer and fall of 1941, many aircraft were sent to Clark in anticipation of a war with Imperial Japan. However, most of them were destroyed on the ground during an air raid nine hours after the Pearl Harbor attack.

The base was attacked by Japanese forces on December 8, 1941 destroying dozens of aircraft and the base was evacuated on December 24. American forces on Bataan and Corregidor fell on April 9, 1942 leading a few days later to the brutal Bataan Death March. Clark became a major center for Japanese air operations throughout the war. Japanese aircraft flying out of Clark participated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the largest naval battle of the Second World War.

During the war, Allied prisoners on the Bataan Death March passed by the main gate of Clark Air Base as they followed the railway tracks north towards Camp O&#x27;Donnell. During October through January 1945 American air raids damaged or destroyed over 1500 Japanese aircraft. On January 31, American forces regained possession of Clark Field after three months of fierce fighting to liberate the Philippines. It was immediately returned to U.S. Army Air Forces control.

Clark grew into a major American air base during the Cold War, as a launching pad for the Korean War and serving as an important logistics hub during the Vietnam War. 

Clark and the other United States bases in the Philippines became the focus of significant controversy in the Philippines during the Dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, becoming one of the most common points of contention raised during numerous major protests. Meanwhile, Marcos was able to use ongoing negotiations for the renewal of the US bases treaty as a way of limiting US government criticism and intervention against human rights abuses, attacks on press freedom, and the shuttering of democratic institutions in the Philippines. When the Marcoses were deposed in February 1986, they fled the Presidential Palace and were flown to Clark, and it was from there that the US government flew them into exile in Hawaii.

Before extensive damage from the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption of 1991, the Philippine government offered to renew the leases on Clark, Subic and a handful of smaller bases for $825 million annually. After the volcanic eruption, the U.S. offered about $200 million annually and only for Subic; the lease for Clark was not renewed.

In November 1991, the United States Air Force lowered the U.S. flag and transferred Clark Air Base to the Philippine government. With the United States military&#x27;s withdrawal from Clark, the base was systematically looted by the local population and was left abandoned for several years. It finally became the Clark Freeport Zone, the site of Clark International Airport (CIA) and parts of it are still owned and operated by the Philippine Air Force, retaining the same name, Clark Air Base.

In June 2012, the Philippine government, under pressure from Chinese claims to their seas, agreed to the return of American military forces to Clark.

===Military units===

During much of the Cold War, Clark Air Base&#x27;s activity largely revolved around the 405th Fighter Wing, later renumbered as the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing in September 1974 and its fleet of F-4 Phantom II fighter jets. It also hosted an interceptor squadron and a flight school, all of which flew a variety of other combat aircraft. Transient aircraft of many types, especially cargo jets, were common.

Fighter planes regularly visited to participate in aerial warfare exercises at Crow Valley about to the northwest. In November 1973, headquarters for the 374th Tactical Airlift Wing was transferred from Ching Chuan Kang Air Base, Taiwan, to Clark Air Base. With this move came two squadrons of C-130E transport aircraft, the 21st Tactical Airlift Squadron and the 776th Tactical Airlift Squadron.

Clark was served regularly by cargo and passenger flights to and from Andersen AFB, Guam; Kadena AB, Japan; Diego Garcia; Jakarta, Indonesia; Bangkok and Ubon Thailand; and Saigon, South Vietnam (until 1975). During the 1970s, passengers arrived via Trans International Douglas DC-8 and Braniff International DC-8s (the Pickle and the Banana) flights from Travis AFB, California (via Honolulu and Guam).

By 1980, the base had grown to such an extent that weekly Flying Tigers Boeing 747 service to St. Louis (via Kadena AB Japan; Anchorage; and Los Angeles) had begun. The 747 service was taken over by Tower Air sometime in the late 1980s and was augmented with a weekly Hawaiian Airlines L-1011 or Douglas DC-8 to Guam-Honolulu-Los Angeles.

===Shootings===
On October 29, 1987, unidentified gunmen shot and killed three airmen.

On May 14, 1990, suspected New People&#x27;s Army (NPA) communist rebels shot and killed two airmen.

==Culture==
Clark Air Base was arguably the most urbanized military facility in history and was the largest American base overseas. At its peak around 1990, it had a permanent population of 15,000. It had a base exchange, large commissary, small shopping arcade, branch department store, cafeterias, teen centers, hotel, miniature golf, riding stables, zoo, and other concessions.

===Recreation===
Angeles City bars were legendary, particularly around the red-light district on Fields Avenue. As a result, Clark&#x27;s servicemen&#x27;s clubs were under considerable pressure to serve its members with wholesome entertainment. All three were large-scale operations: the Officer&#x27;s Club (CABOOM) near the parade ground, the Top Hat Club for non-commissioned officers (NCOs) near Lily Hill, which moved to near the Silver Wing in 1986, and the Coconut Grove Airmen Open Mess (AOM) housed in a large vaulted room that contained palm trees. The officer&#x27;s club featured a four star dining room, but catered to NCO&#x27;s during lunchtime. The airman&#x27;s club got first dibs on Broadway shows and swing bands due to an agreement that whoever paid transportation costs got priority. The NCO club came second. The airman&#x27;s club had numerous theme bars and rental girls for dance partners during swing band tenures on the large dance floor. The club security (bouncers) were outfitted in formal PI wear each evening of a different hue. The PI formal wear for men was lace shirts (the barong Tagalog) with French cuffs, traditional and very elegant. The volume of enlisted troops flowing through PI to Vietnam created a large audience for AOM offerings. The NCO Club was still a very extensive operation and operated an upscale dining room, an in-house thrift shop, a pinball arcade, and a calendar of daily activities. It regularly brought major bands and artists from the United States to perform.

At least a hundred sponsored clubs and organizations were active on the base, including the Knights of Columbus, a Latino American club, the Civil Air Patrol, and martial arts dojos. Two major movie theaters operated daily: the Bobbitt Theater which played first-run films, and the Kelly Theater which showed older releases. By 1988 the Kelly Theater ceased showing films and was used mainly for Commander&#x27;s Calls and large squadron-sized meetings. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, movies were also shown at the Bamboo Bowl, the football stadium on base.

The Bamboo Bowl, later renamed Challenger Field, was used mainly for high school football games as the school did not have its own athletic field. In addition to high school football games, it also hosted recreational league football games for ages 8–18. The high school football teams were included as part of the recreational league. The base&#x27;s sole high school, Wagner High, had multiple football teams. It was also used for the base&#x27;s 11-man tackle football league, which not only included teams from Clark but from Subic Naval Base as well.

To keep the residents entertained at home, Clark had an active broadcast center called FEN, or Far East Network Philippines, a division of American Forces Network. A television station broadcast on Channel 8, then Channel 17 after 1981. It showed about 20 hours per day of syndicated programs from the &quot;big three&quot; networks in the United States, with local news and talk programs. The content was locally syndicated until 1983 when it began airing live programming by satellite from Los Angeles.

FEN had two 24-hour radio stations: an AM station which broadcast news and popular music, and stereo FM which was dedicated to easy-listening and classical music. Local Filipino TV also aired newer American shows than FEN did. Unlike the local TV stations in Europe, they were broadcast in the same format as American TV and not dubbed in Tagalog, the local language. Likewise, several American-styled radio stations in Manila were popular with Clark residents: one notable example in the 1980s was 99.5 DWRT-FM.

Two major annual events at Clark were the annual Chili Cookoff, held near the Silver Wing recreation center around September, and the Happening on the Green (&quot;the HOG&quot;) in February. The HOG attracted thousands of residents. Amusements and rides were built and operated not only by Filipino entertainment contractors but also by individual Air Force units seeking to boost unit morale, showcase their talents, and raise unit funds.

Because of the warm climate and the large number of units, slow pitch softball tournaments were held quarterly. There were at least two gymnasiums, three walking/running tracks and seven softball fields on base. There were also tennis courts, a clubhouse with tennis merchandise, and tennis pros available for a couple of dollars per hour to hit with you at any time. They had a local tournament each year.

===Pop culture references===
In 2013, author Nick Auclair published &quot;Steel&#x27;s Treasure&quot;, a fictional novel set on Clark Air Base.

The 1969 novel &quot;One to Count Cadence&quot;, by James Crumley, has its initial setting in an Army unit stationed at Clark Air Base, and has become the &quot;Catch 22&quot; novel of the Vietnam War.

===Education===
The Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DoDDS) operated six schools at Clark Air Base, serving children from kindergarten to twelfth grade.

* Elementary schools (kindergarten-5th grade): MacArthur Elementary School, V. I. Grissom Elementary School, and Wurtsmith Elementary School. The latter two were located in the hill housing area. Most officers and senior enlisted families attended Grissom. 
* Middle schools (6th–8th grade): Lily Hill Middle School, and Wagner Middle School. The latter primarily served the hill housing area and officer dependents.
* High school: Wagner High School, known as Clark Dependent School in the 1950s and Wurtsmith Memorial High School in the 1960s.

Clark was also home to several community colleges, namely the Pacific Far East Campus of Central Texas College. Most classes were held in the evenings at Wagner High School.

==Climate==
Climate at the base is characterized by two distinct seasons: a &quot;dry season&quot; from November through April, and a &quot;rainy season&quot; with monsoon rains that occur from May through October. During the dry season, winds are usually northeasterly and skies are fair. Some afternoon showers tend to appear by April. April brings the highest average temperatures of any month, though the hottest days of the year tend to occur in May. Due to the very dry state of vegetation at this time, ash and soot often falls on Clark Air Base as farmers burn their fields for planting. During drought years, wildfires occasionally broke out in the overgrown areas west of the golf course and northeast of the airfield.

Rainy season normally arrives during the month of June. July and August are wet, with many dark overcast days, and frequent afternoon and evening rains. Typhoons are common in late summer and fall, approaching from the east. They are rarely strong at Clark Air Base as the facilities are far inland, and the typhoon circulation is disrupted by the Sierra Madre mountain range on the east coast. Rain and typhoon activity diminishes sharply by November and December, when the dry season arrives once again. Temperatures are at their coolest, with nighttime lows sometimes falling to 64 °F (18 °C) or lower.

From 1953 to 1991, the mean daily low was and the mean daily high was , with April being warmest and January coolest. The average annual rainfall was .

<doc id="426244" wikidata="Q854910" url="?curid=426244" title="List of heads of state of Malawi">
<text>This is a list of the heads of state of Malawi, from the independence of Malawi in 1964 to the present day.

From 1964 to 1966 the head of state under the Constitution of 1964 was the queen of Malawi, Elizabeth II, who was also the monarch of other Commonwealth realms. The monarch was represented in Malawi by a governor-general. Malawi became a republic within the Commonwealth under the Constitution of 1966 and the monarch and governor-general were replaced by an executive president.

==Monarch (1964–1966)==
The succession to the throne was the same as the succession to the British throne.

===Governor-general===

The governor-general was the representative of the monarch in Malawi and exercised most of the powers of the monarch. The governor-general was appointed for an indefinite term, serving at the pleasure of the monarch. Since Malawi was granted independence by the Malawi Independence Act 1964, rather than being first established as a semi-autonomous dominion and later promoted to independence as defined by the Statute of Westminster 1931, the governor-general was to be always appointed solely on the advice of the Cabinet of Malawi without the involvement of the British government. As Malawi became a republic before Glyn Jones, the former colonial governor, was replaced, this never happened. In the event of a vacancy the chief justice would have served as the officer administering the government.

==Republic (1966–present)==

Under the country&#x27;s 1966, 1994 and 1995 constitutions, the president is executive head of state.

The first president, Hastings Banda, was elected by the National Assembly and subsequently had himself declared president for life in 1970. He was defeated in 1994, a year after his life term was abolished as part of Malawi&#x27;s transition to democracy. Since then, presidents have been elected in direct popular elections for a five-year term. Presidents may be elected any number of times, but not more than twice in a row. In the event of a vacancy, the vice-president becomes president for the balance of the term.

<doc id="426247" wikidata="Q523783" url="?curid=426247" title="Donald Carcieri">
<text>Donald Louis Carcieri ( ; ; born December 16, 1942) is an American politician and corporate executive who served as the 73rd Governor of Rhode Island from January 2003 to January 2011. Carcieri has worked as a manufacturing company executive, aid relief worker, bank executive, and teacher. He is the latest member of the Republican Party to have served as Governor of Rhode Island.

==Personal background==
Carcieri was born and raised in East Greenwich, Rhode Island, the son of Marguerite E. (née Anderson) and Nicola J. Carcieri, a football and basketball coach at East Greenwich High School. His father was of Italian descent and his mother was of Swedish descent. Carcieri played baseball, basketball, and football while in high school and received a college scholarship. He graduated from Brown University with a degree in International Relations. Carcieri started his career as a high school math teacher, working in Newport, Rhode Island, and Concord, Massachusetts. He later became a banker and businessman, working his way up the ranks to become an executive vice president at Old Stone Bank.

In 1981, Carcieri and his family moved to Kingston, Jamaica, where he worked for Catholic Relief Services. Two years later, he returned to Rhode Island and became an executive at the Cookson Group. He eventually became Joint Managing Director for Cookson and CEO of the company&#x27;s Cookson America subsidiary. At the request of Carcieri, Cookson established their U.S. headquarters in an unused building in downtown Providence. As of 2006 he had 4 children and 13 grandchildren.

==Governorship==
He ran for Governor of Rhode Island in 2002. In the Republican primary election, he defeated James Bennett, who had won the endorsement of the state Republican Party. He went on to defeat Democrat Myrth York, 55% to 45% in the general election.

===Station night club fire===
On February 20, 2003, The Station nightclub in West Warwick, Rhode Island, was engulfed in a catastrophic fire which claimed 100 lives. The fire, which was one of the worst such tragedies in American history, was widely covered by the national press, which gave Carcieri&#x27;s public statements on the event nationwide coverage. Eventually the Governor declared a moratorium on pyrotechnics for crowds under 300 people.

===Conflicts with the legislature===
In 2005, both houses of the Rhode Island General Assembly passed a bill legalizing medical marijuana. Carcieri vetoed the bill, but the legislature overrode Carcieri by a large margin. Carcieri and the Democratic-dominated General Assembly have been at odds on a number of issues: enacting separation of powers, the treatment of state workers, and whether children of illegal immigrants should have access to the state childcare health care plan. Carcieri often warned against increasing the size of the state&#x27;s welfare programs as unaffordable and unsustainable and that the state suffers economically from a history of corruption. Carcieri has had a history of confrontations with the heavily Democratic state legislature, community activists, and organized labor.

===Re-election===

Carcieri won re-election in 2006. Rhode Island is one of 19 states that elects its governor and lieutenant governor separately rather than on a single party ticket; Carcieri faced his own Lieutenant Governor, Democrat Charles J. Fogarty, who was prevented, by term limits, from running again for the Lieutenant Governor position.

===2007 snowstorm===
One of the most controversial events of Carcieri&#x27;s governorship occurred on December 13, 2007, when the state of Rhode Island experienced a storm which dumped about 10–12 inches of snow on the state at the time of the evening commute. It became known as the &quot;December Debacle.&quot; On that day, Carcieri was in the Middle East and could not be contacted until the storm was over. As a result of the timing of the storm and of conflicts between various state agencies about who was responsible for emergency management during Carcieri&#x27;s absence, there was inadequate snow clearance on major highways, causing gridlock long into the night and stranding several buses of schoolchildren in snowbanks for a number of hours. Widely criticized for blocking the Lieutenant Governor from taking charge in his absence, Carcieri admitted that his administration did &quot;a poor job of communications&quot; during the storm. However, he refused to answer questions concerning who would be in charge of the state in the event of his absence. Eventually a judge required Carcieri to release documents indicating his orders on the chain of command in such situations.

===Immigration===

On March 27, 2008, Carcieri signed an Executive Order requiring state agencies and vendors to verify the legal status of all employees and directing the Rhode Island State Police and the Department of Corrections to work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to ensure federal immigration laws are enforced.

===Stance on LGBT issues===
Carcieri is a member of the National Organization for Marriage which advocates for marriage to be legally defined as a union of one man and one woman.

In November 2009, Carcieri vetoed H 5294 which, if enacted, would allow domestic partners to oversee and care for a same-sex partner&#x27;s funeral arrangements. The bill&#x27;s impetus was motivated by an event when the State refused to release the body of a man to his 17 year same-sex partner. In his veto message, Carcieri made the following statement: &quot;This bill represents a disturbing trend over the past few years of the incremental erosion of the principles surrounding traditional marriage, which is not the preferred way to approach this issue.&quot;

In January 2010, the Legislature voted to override the veto.

===2009 furlough controversy===
In the fiscal year 2010, the state of Rhode Island was facing a budget shortfall of $528 million. In an effort to shed $67.8 million, Carcieri imposed 12 furlough days. The first unpaid day was to occur on Friday, September 5, 2009. The unions representing state workers were able to, in the 11th hour, have a restraining order issued by Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice Maureen McKenna Goldberg with a full court hearing on the matter to occur on September 12. Almost immediately Carcieri issued a press release noting he now has no other option but layoffs. He further went on to say &quot;It should greatly disturb every state employee and every Rhode Islander that labor leaders are willing to sacrifice people’s jobs so they can maintain their stranglehold on the citizens of this state.&quot;

<text>The Colorado General Assembly is the state legislature of the State of Colorado. It is a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and House of Representatives that was created by the 1876 state constitution. Its statutes are codified in the &quot;Colorado Revised Statutes&quot; (C.R.S.). The session laws are published in the &quot;Session Laws of Colorado&quot;.

Colorado&#x27;s legislature is similar to those of other states, except that, unlike many states, Colorado does not give its lieutenant governor any legislative authority (e.g. tie-breaking vote).

==History==

The first meeting of the Colorado General Assembly took place from November 1, 1876, through March 20, 1877. Succeeding sessions met every two years until 1950, when it began to meet annually.

The lieutenant governor served as Senate President until 1974 when Article V, Section 10 of the state constitution was amended, granting the Colorado Senate the right to elect one of its own members as President.

==Constitutional definition==
The Colorado Constitution establishes a system of government based on the separation of powers doctrine with power divided among the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government. Article V vests the legislative power of the state in the General Assembly, while reserving to the people the power to propose, approve, and reject both laws and amendments to the state Constitution by initiatives or referendums.

==Composition==
The General Assembly is bicameral, composed of the Colorado House of Representatives and the Colorado Senate. The House has 65 members and the Senate 35. Members of the House are elected to two-year terms, and members of the Senate are elected to four-year terms.

General legislative elections are held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in each even-numbered year. The entire House is elected in each general election. Senators are elected in two classes such that, as nearly as possible, one-half of the senators are elected in each general election.

House members are limited to four consecutive terms in office, and state senators are limited to two consecutive terms. However, term-limited former members of both houses can run again after a four-year break.

The vast majority of members of the General Assembly who are ultimately elected (in excess of 90% of members ultimately elected in all recent sessions) are nominated through a major political party caucus process that places candidates on a primary ballot for the position sought in their political party, which generally requires 30% support from delegates to the relevant nominating body of the political party. It is also possible for individuals who have been registered to vote and affiliated with the political party in question for at least a year to gain access to a partisan primary ballot by petition.
Minor party candidates can gain access to the general election ballot through a minor party caucus process. Unaffiliated candidates can gain access to the general election ballot by petition.

Vacancies in legislative offices are generally filled by political party vacancy committees, rather than special elections. Vacancy appointees who fill the first half of a state senators term must stand for election at the next even year November election for the remainder of the state senate term for the seat to which the state senator was appointed.

The state auditor is appointed by the General Assembly, as are many members of independent boards and commissions.

Currently, the Colorado General Assembly is controlled by the Democratic Party. Democrats also hold the governor&#x27;s office.

The Colorado General Assembly was the first state legislature to welcome women as elected members, with Clara Cressingham, Carrie C. Holly and Frances S. Klock all being elected to the State House of Representatives in 1894 and Helen Robinson being elected to the State Senate in 1912 (the second state upper house in the country to welcome women as members).

==Procedure and powers==
With the notable exceptions listed below, the Colorado General Assembly operates in a manner quite similar to the United States Congress.

Regular sessions are held annually and begin no later than the second Wednesday in January. Regular sessions last no more than 120 days. Special sessions may be called at any time by the governor or upon written request of two-thirds of the members of each house, but are infrequent. Some committees of the General Assembly work between sessions and have limited power to take action without General Assembly approval between legislative sessions.

Joint procedural rules of the two chambers require most legislation to be introduced very early in the legislative session each year, and to meet strict deadlines for completion of each step of the legislative process. Joint procedural rules also limit each legislator to introducing five bills per year, subject to certain exceptions for non-binding resolutions, uniform acts, interim committee bills and appropriations bills. Most members of the General Assembly decide which bills they will introduce during the legislative session (or most of them) prior to its commencement, limiting the ability of members to introduce new bills at constituent request once the legislative session has begun.

Most bills adopted by the General Assembly include a &quot;safety clause&quot; (i.e. a legislative declaration that the bill concerns an urgent matter) and take effect on July 1 following the legislative session unless otherwise provided. Some bills are enacted without a &quot;safety clause&quot; which makes it possible to petition to subject those bills to a referendum before they take effect, and have an effective date in August following the legislative session unless otherwise provided.

Colorado&#x27;s legislature does not have an analog to the filibuster in the United States Senate requiring a supermajority for approval of any matter. The lieutenant governor does not have the power to preside or break tie votes in either house of the General Assembly. All new executive branch rules are reviewed annually by the legislature and the legislature routinely invalidates some of them each year.

The General Assembly does have subpoena power, However this power is rarely used.

The General Assembly does not have a role in the appointment or retention of state judges, although it must authorize the creation of each judgeship.

Many state agencies and programs are subject to &quot;sunset review&quot; and are automatically abolished if the General Assembly does not reauthorize them.

==The state budget process==
The governor submits a proposed budget to the Joint Budget Committee each year in advance of the year&#x27;s legislative session. Colorado&#x27;s fiscal year is from July 1 to June 30.

All bills introduced in the General Assembly are evaluated by the non-partisan state legislative services body for their fiscal impact and must be provided for in appropriations legislation if there is a fiscal impact.

A state budget, called the &quot;Long Bill&quot; is prepared each year by the Joint Budget Committee of the General Assembly. Unlike many legislative initiatives, the Long Bill is neither an acronym nor named after an individual with significant influence. The Long Bill is simply a lengthy bill that contains many appropriations. The House and the Senate alternate the job of introducing the long bill and making a first committee review of it. Colorado&#x27;s state legislature is required to obtain voter approval in order to incur significant debt, to raise taxes, or to increase state constitutional spending limitations. It is also required to comply with a state constitutional spending mandate for K-12 education. The Governor has line item veto power over appropriations.

==Legislative staff==

The Colorado General Assembly is staffed by approximately 230-year-round staff and 115 session-only staff. Staffing levels and expenditures have decreased since 2003. Similarly to Congressional staffers, legislative staff in Colorado fall into five broad categories: member staff, administrative staff, committee staff, communications and leadership staff, and legal service staff. With the exception of those working in communications and leadership, employees of the General Assembly are non-partisan staffers.

==Current makeup==
There are 65 House Members and 35 Senate Members making up the 100 seats in Colorado General Assembly. Based on the 2010 census, each House member represents about 77,372 constituents and each Senator 143,691.

The 2018 Colorado elections resulted in Democrats extending their control in the House (41 Democrats; 24 Republicans) and capturing the Senate majority.

All 65 Colorado House seats were up for election in 2022. The chamber&#x27;s Democratic majority increased to 46-19, keeping a supermajority. Also, the Democrats kept their majority in the 2022 elections for the Colorado State Senate. The current Senate makeup is 23 Democrats and 12 Republicans.

The 74th session will mark the first time in state history that women will hold the majority of seats in the General Assembly.

<doc id="426255" wikidata="Q7008154" url="?curid=426255" title="New Hampshire General Court">
<text>The General Court of New Hampshire is the bicameral state legislature of the U.S. state of New Hampshire. The lower house is the New Hampshire House of Representatives with 400 members, and the upper house is the New Hampshire Senate with 24 members. This ratio of one Senate seat for every 16.67 House seats makes New Hampshire&#x27;s ratio of upper house to lower house seats the largest in the country.

The General Court convenes in the New Hampshire State House in downtown Concord, opened in 1819. The House of Representatives continues to meet in its original chambers, making Representatives Hall the oldest chamber in the United States still in continuous legislative use. When numbered seats were installed in Representatives Hall, the number thirteen was purposely omitted in deference to triskaidekaphobia.

The annual pay for legislators is set by law at $100.00.

==House of Representatives==
The House of Representatives consists of 400 members coming from 204 districts across the state created from divisions of the state&#x27;s counties, each making up about 3,000 residents for every one legislator.

Unlike many legislative chambers, there is no central &quot;aisle&quot; to cross. Instead, there are five sections with aisles between them. Seats are pre-assigned.

=== Composition of the House of Representatives ===

, the composition of the House of Representatives is:
==New Hampshire Senate==
The New Hampshire Senate has been meeting since 1784. It consists of 24 members representing Senate districts based on population. As of the 2025–26 legislative session, there are 16 Republicans and 8 Democrats in the Senate.

=== Composition of the Senate ===

==Media coverage==

The New Hampshire State House press covers the New Hampshire State House for newspapers, news services and other news-gathering operations. The New Hampshire General Court website has calendars and journals for both the House and the Senate.

Pew Research Center in 2014 reported New Hampshire had one of the nation&#x27;s smallest statehouse press corps, with five full-time reporters and an additional nine part-time reporters.

<doc id="426256" wikidata="Q5290887" url="?curid=426256" title="1970 Dominicana de Aviación DC-9 crash">
<text>&lt;noinclude&gt;

On February 15, 1970, a Dominicana de Aviación McDonnell Douglas DC-9 operating as Dominciana de Aviación Flight 603 enroute from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic to San Juan, Puerto Rico crashed into the Caribbean Sea shortly after takeoff. The crash killed all 97 passengers and 5 crew on board, making it the deadliest aviation disaster to occur within the Dominican Republic until the crash of Birgenair Flight 301 in 1996, in the Caribbean Sea, leaving 189 dead.

== Aircraft ==
The aircraft, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 registered as HI-177 (with serial number 47500 and line number 546), was manufactured by McDonnell Douglas the 1969. The aircraft was powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-7 turbofan engines. It had been in service with Dominicana for less than a month (with only 354 flying hours) when it crashed.

== Accident ==
The airliner was operating an international flight from Las Américas International Airport near Santo Domingo, to San Juan&#x27;s Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport. The flight took off at about 6:30 PM. Two minutes after departure, one of the engines lost thrust. The crew declared an emergency, telling air traffic controllers that the right engine had flamed out, and requested to immediately return to the airport. While the crew were preparing to turn back toward the airport, the left engine also flamed out. The aircraft descended until it hit the sea about two miles south of the airport. There were no survivors among the 97 passengers and five crew members on board.

== Investigation ==
There were initially concerns of a terrorist attack as the family of Antonio Imbert Barrera was on board. However, the investigation concluded that the cause of the crash was the sequential failure of both engines caused by fuel contamination due to water ingress. Neither the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) or flight data recorder (FDR) was ever found.

==Notable victims==
Several famous passengers were among the dead, including:
*Former world lightweight boxing champion Carlos Cruz, who was flying alongside his wife and their two children back to San Juan for a fight against Roger Zami.
*The coach and eleven players of the Puerto Rico women&#x27;s national volleyball team, who were returning home after a friendly game against the Dominican Republic women&#x27;s national volleyball team.

== Aftermath ==
Immediately after the Santo Domingo crash, Dominicana suspended all operations. Four of the airline&#x27;s mechanics were reportedly arrested as well. In addition, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) banned Dominicana aircraft from operating to the United States. The ban was lifted later in the year after Dominicana leased a replacement DC-9 aircraft, to be flown by crews from the Spanish airline Iberia.

Dominicana eventually resumed full services, including to the United States. The airline flew until 1995 when the government of Joaquín Balaguer forced it to suspend services indefinitely, officially ceasing all operations in 1999.

<text>Stone skipping and stone skimming are the arts of throwing a flat stone across water in such a way (usually sidearm) that it bounces off the surface. &quot;Skipping&quot; counts the number of bounces; &quot;skimming&quot; measures the distance traveled.

==History==
The 2nd-century CE Greek scholar Julius Pollux calls the game ἐποστρακισμός. The 3rd-century CE Latin writer Marcus Minucius Felix described children skipping shells on the beach. In England, a 1583 text calls it &quot;Ducks and Drakes&quot;. An early explanation of the physics of stone-skipping was provided by Lazzaro Spallanzani in the 18th century.

===Records===
The world record for the number of skips, according to the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;, is 88, by Kurt &quot;Mountain Man&quot; Steiner. The cast was achieved on September 6, 2013, at Red Bridge in the Allegheny National Forest, Pennsylvania. The previous record was 65 skips, by Max Steiner (no relation), set at Riverfront Park, Franklin, Pennsylvania. Before him, the record was 51 skips, set by Russell Byars on July 19, 2007, skipping at the same location. Kurt Steiner also held the world record between 2002 and 2007 with a throw of 40 skips, achieved in competition in Franklin, PA.

The Guinness World Record for the furthest distance skimmed using natural stone stands at 121.8m for men, established by Dougie Isaacs (Scotland), and 52.5m for women, thrown by Nina Luginbuhl (Switzerland). These records were made on 28 May 2018 at Abernant Lake, Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, Wales.

There are several stone skimming championships held. The record for most World Championship wins also sits with Dougie Isaacs (Scotland), with 8 Men&#x27;s World Stone Skimming Championship wins (2005, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016) and the Women&#x27;s World Stone Skimming Championship wins record sits with Lucy Wood (England) with 5 wins (2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2018).

==Championships==
The &quot;Big Four&quot; American stone skipping contests include (in order of establishment and participant rankings): 
# The Mackinac Island championship, held on July 4 in northern Michigan (entry by invite only; must win prior Mackinac Open or Pennsylvania Qualifier to enter); 
# The Pennsylvania championship, held usually the 3rd Saturday of August in Franklin, PA, about one hour southeast of Erie (winners invited to the subsequent Michigan contest);
# The Vermont championship (about one month after Pennsylvania) on the shore of Lake Paran, North of Bennington; and
# The Great Southern championship in Arkansas (Labor Day weekend).

Former world champion Coleman-McGhee founded the North American Stone Skipping Association (NASSA) in 1989 in Driftwood, Texas. NASSA-sanctioned world championships were held from 1989 through 1992 in Wimberley, Texas. The next official NASSA World Championship is expected to be held at Platja d&#x27;en Ros beach in Cadaqués, Catalonia, Spain..

A stone skimming championship takes place every year in Easdale, Scotland, where relative distance counts as opposed to the number of skips, as tends to be the case outside of the US. The event was run for more than 20 years by Donald Melville, who is seen as having done more for the sport than anyone. Since 1997, competitors from all over the world have taken part in the World Stone Skimming Championships (WSSC) in a disused water-filled quarry on Easdale Island using sea-worn Easdale slate of maximum 3&quot; diameter. Each participant gets three throws and the stone must bounce/skip at least twice to count (i.e. 3 water touches minimum). The event featured in the 2019 BBC Scotland documentary &quot;Sink or Skim&quot;. The WSSC for 2020-2022 were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic before resuming competition in September 2023.

Other domestic distance-based championships in the UK are currently the Welsh and British, but they were cancelled in 2020 and 2021 for reasons including the COVID-19 pandemic. The British is next due to be held in 2023. Japan holds competitions where both skimming and skipping principles, as well as a throw&#x27;s overall aesthetic quality, are taken into account to determine the winners. At present, there is also a competition at Ermatingen in Switzerland and occasionally in the Netherlands (both skimming/distance-based).

==Underlying physics==

Although stone skipping occurs at the air-water interface, surface tension has very little to do with the physics of stone-skipping. Instead, the stones are a flying wing akin to a planing boat or Frisbee, generating lift from a body angled upwards and a high horizontal speed.

The same physical effects apply to a stone when traveling in air or water. However, the force only compares to gravity when immersed in water, because the latter fluid has higher density. The result is a characteristic bouncing or skipping motion, in which a series of extremely brief collisions with the water appear to support the stone.

During each collision, the stone&#x27;s horizontal velocity is approximately constant and its vertical motion can be approximated as a non-Hookean spring. The stone is only partially immersed, and lift from the immersed back suspends the stone and torques it towards tumbling. That torque is stabilized by the gyroscope effect: the stone-skipper imparts a perpendicular initial angular momentum much larger than the collisional impulse, so that the latter induces only a small precession in the axis of rotation.

Stones improperly oriented at the moment of collision will not rebound: the largest observed angle of attack preceding a rebound occurred at an angle of approximately 45°. Conversely, a stone making angle 20° with the water&#x27;s surface may rebound even at relatively low velocities, as well as minimizing the time and energy spent in the following collision.

In principle, a stone can skip arbitrarily-long distances, given a sufficiently high initial speed and rotation. Each collision saps an approximately constant kinetic energy from the stone (a dynamical equation equivalent to Coulomb friction), as well as imparting an approximately constant angular impulse. Experiments suggest that initial angular momentum&#x27;s stabilizing effect limits most stones: even &quot;long-lived&quot; throws still have high translational velocities when they finally sink.

<text>The Vermont General Assembly is the legislative body of the state of Vermont, in the United States. The Legislature is formally known as the &quot;General Assembly&quot;, but the style of &quot;Legislature&quot; is commonly used, including by the body itself. The General Assembly is a bicameral legislature, consisting of the 150-member Vermont House of Representatives and the 30-member Vermont Senate.
Members of the House are elected by single and two-member districts. 68 districts choose one member, and 41 choose two, with the term of service being two years. The Senate includes 30 Senators, elected by seven single-member and nine multi-member districts with two or three members each. It is the only state legislative body in the United States in which a third party has had continuous representation and been consecutively elected alongside Democrats and Republicans.

The Vermont General Assembly meets at the Vermont State House in the state capital of Montpelier. Biennial terms commence on the Wednesday following the first Monday in January (beginning in 1915; thus, terms commence in odd-numbered years).

==Elections==
Legislative elections are held in November of every even-numbered year. Representatives and Senators serve two-year terms. One must be a resident of the state for the two years, and of the legislative district for the one year immediately preceding the election in order to qualify for either house.

The House is headed by the Speaker of the House, while the Senate is headed by the State&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor as the Senate President. The Senate President has only a casting vote. More often, the Senate is presided over by the President pro tempore, who is chosen at the start of each session.

For past partisan compositions of both houses see Political party strength in Vermont.

==Functions==
The Legislature is empowered to make law, subject to the Governor&#x27;s power to veto a bill. However, the veto may be overridden by the Legislature if there is a two-thirds majority in favor of overriding in each chamber.

The Legislature has the sole power to propose amendments to the Constitution of Vermont. An amendment must originate in the Senate, where it must receive a two-thirds vote. After passing the Senate, it must also receive a majority vote in the House. Any amendment that passes both Houses must be repassed by majority votes, after a newly elected legislature is seated; again, first in the Senate, then in the House. The proposed amendment must then be passed by a majority of the state&#x27;s voters at a referendum. Only every other Senate session may initiate the amendment process. Thus, Senates elected in off-year (i.e. non-Presidential) elections may initiate amendments, but not Senates elected during Presidential elections. (Vermont Constitution, Chapter 2, Section 72)

==History==
Vermont had a unicameral legislature until 1836. It added a senate by constitutional amendment. Prior to 1915, the legislature opened its session in the fall. In 1915 it began opening in January. The legislature takes a break the week of Town Meeting Day in March.

=== One Town, One Vote ===
From 1777 to 1965, each city/town elected one representative to the Vermont House of Representatives, regardless of the population of the municipality. This changed with the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s 1964 decree of &quot;One Man, One Vote&quot; in &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot;, which affected all state legislatures across the Union.

<text>David Sklansky (born December 22, 1947) is an American professional poker player and author. An early writer on poker strategy, he is known for his mathematical approach to the game. His key work &quot;The Theory of Poker&quot; presents fundamental principles on which much later analysis is based.

==Early years==
Sklansky was born and raised in Teaneck, New Jersey, where he graduated from Teaneck High School in 1966. He attended the University of Pennsylvania, but dropped out before graduation. He returned to Teaneck and passed multiple Society of Actuaries exams by the age of 20, and worked for an actuarial firm.

==Poker career==
Sklansky is an authority on gambling. He has written and contributed to fourteen books on poker, blackjack, and general gambling.

Sklansky has won three World Series of Poker bracelets, two in 1982 ($800 Mixed Doubles with Dani Kelly, and $1,000 Draw Hi) and one in 1983 ($1,000 Limit Omaha Hi). He also won the &quot;Poker By The Book&quot; invitational event on the 2004 World Poker Tour, outlasting a table full of poker legends, which included Phil Hellmuth Jr, Mike Caro, T. J. Cloutier, and Mike Sexton, and then finally overcoming Doyle Brunson.

Sklansky attended the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania for a year before leaving to become a professional gambler. He briefly took on a job as an actuary before embarking into poker. While on the job, he discovered a faster way to do some of the calculations and took that discovery to his boss. The boss told him he could go ahead and do it that way if he wanted but wouldn&#x27;t pass on the information to the other workers. &quot;In other words, I knew something no one else knew, but I got no recognition for it,&quot; Sklansky is quoted as saying in Al Alvarez&#x27;s 1983 work &quot;The Biggest Game in Town.&quot; &quot;In poker, if you&#x27;re better than anyone else, you make immediate money. If there&#x27;s something I know about the game that the other person doesn&#x27;t, and if he&#x27;s not willing to learn or can&#x27;t understand, then I take his money.&quot;

As of 2015, his live tournament winnings exceed $1,350,000. He lives in Las Vegas, Nevada.

===World Series of Poker bracelets===
==Publications==
Sklansky has authored or co-authored 14 books on gambling theory and poker. Most of his books are published by Two Plus Two Publishing. His book cover art often features hand guns. His 1976 book &quot;Hold&#x27;em Poker&quot; was the first book widely available on the subject of hold&#x27;em poker. It&#x27;s through these books that he popularized the concept of Sklansky Bucks (now often referred to as luck-adjusted winnings), which are used by professional poker players to this day.

<text>The State of Rhode Island General Assembly is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Rhode Island. A bicameral body, it is composed of the lower Rhode Island House of Representatives with 75 representatives, and the upper Rhode Island Senate with 38 senators. Members are elected in the general election immediately preceding the beginning of the term or in special elections called to fill vacancies. There are no term limits for either chamber. The last General Assembly election took place on 2024, electing members to the Senate and House.

The General Assembly meets at the Rhode Island State House on the border of Downtown and Smith Hill in Providence. Smith Hill is sometimes used as a metonym for the Rhode Island General Assembly.

== History ==

===Early independence===
On June 12, 1775, the Rhode Island General Assembly met at East Greenwich to pass a resolution creating the first formal, governmentally authorized navy in the Western Hemisphere: &quot;It is voted and resolved, that the committee of safety be, and they are hereby, directed to charter two suitable vessels, for the use of the colony, and fit out the same in the best manner, to protect the trade of this colony... &quot;That the largest of the said vessels be manned with eighty men, exclusive of officers; and be equipped with ten guns, four-pounders; fourteen swivel guns, a sufficient number of small arms, and all necessary warlike stores. &quot;That the small vessel be manned with a number not exceeding thirty men. &quot;That the whole be included in the number of fifteen hundred men, ordered to be raised in this colony... &quot;That they receive the same bounty and pay as the land forces...&quot;The Rhode Island General Assembly was one of the thirteen colonial legislatures that rejected British rule in the American War of Independence. The General Assembly was the first legislative body during the war to seriously consider independence from Great Britain. On May 4, 1776, five months before the Continental Congress formally adopted the United States Declaration of Independence, Rhode Island became the first colony of what would soon be the future United States to legally leave the British Empire. William Ellery and the first chancellor of Brown University Stephen Hopkins were signatories to the Declaration of Independence for Rhode Island.

A decisive march ending with the defeat of British forces commanded by Charles Cornwallis began in Newport, Rhode Island under the command of French forces sent by King Louis XVI and led by the Comte de Rochambeau. The American forces in the march were jointly led by General George Washington. The march proceeded through Providence, Rhode Island and ended with the defeat of British forces following the Siege of Yorktown at Yorktown, Virginia and the naval Battle of the Chesapeake. Nathanael Greene was a member along with his cousin, Christopher Greene.

===Federal debate===
Over a decade after the war, the General Assembly led by the Country Party pushed aside calls to join the newly formed federal government, citing its demands that a Bill of Rights should be included in the new federal U.S. Constitution and its opposition to slavery. With a Bill of Rights under consideration and with an ultimatum from the new federal government of the United States that it would begin to impose export taxes on Rhode Island goods if it did not join the Union, the General Assembly relented. On May 29, 1790, Rhode Island became the last of the Thirteen Colonies to sign the U.S. Constitution, becoming the thirteenth U.S. state (and the smallest).

===State constitutions===
From 1663 until 1842, Rhode Island&#x27;s governing state constitution was its original colonial charter granted by King Charles II of England, a political anomaly considering that while most states during the War of Independence and afterwards wrote scores of new constitutions with their newly found independence in mind, Rhode Island instead continued with a document stamped by an English king. Even nearly seventy years after U.S. independence, Rhode Island continued to operate with the 1663 Charter, leaving it after 1818 (when Connecticut, the other holdout, dropped its colonial charter for a contemporary constitution) the only state whose official legal document was passed by a foreign monarch.

While the 1663 Charter was democratic considering its time period, rising national demands for voting suffrage in response to the Industrial Revolution put strains on the colonial document. By the early 1830s, only 40% of the state&#x27;s white males could vote, one of the lowest white male voting franchise percentages in the entire United States. For its part, the General Assembly proved to be an obstacle for change, not eager to see its traditional wealthy voting base shrink.

Constitutional reform came to a head in 1841 when supporters of universal suffrage led by Thomas Wilson Dorr, dissatisfied with the conservative General Assembly and the state&#x27;s conservative governor, Samuel Ward King, held the extralegal People&#x27;s Convention, calling on Rhode Islanders to debate a new liberal constitution. At the same time, the General Assembly began its own constitution convention dubbed the Freeman&#x27;s Convention, making some democratic concessions to Dorr supporters, while keeping other aspects of the 1663 Charter intact.

Elections in late 1841 and early 1842 led to both sides claiming to be the legitimate state government, each with their own respective constitutions in hand. In the days following the highly confusing and contentious 1842 gubernatorial and state legislature elections, Governor King declared martial law. Liberal Dorr supporters took up arms to begin the Dorr Rebellion.

The short-lived rebellion proved unsuccessful in overthrowing Governor King and the General Assembly. The Freeman&#x27;s Constitution eventually was debated upon by the legislature and passed by the electorate. Although not as liberal as the People&#x27;s document, the 1843 Freeman&#x27;s Constitution did greatly increase male suffrage in Rhode Island, including ending the racial requirement. Further revisions in the 1843 document were made by the General Assembly and passed by the electorate in 1986.

<text>The Connecticut General Assembly (CGA) is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Connecticut. It is a bicameral body composed of the 151-member House of Representatives and the 36-member Senate. It meets in the state capital, Hartford. There are no term limits for members of either chamber.

During even-numbered years, the General Assembly is in session from February to May. In odd-numbered years, when the state budget is completed, session lasts from January to June. The governor has the right to call for a special session after the end of the regular session, while the General Assembly can call for a &quot;veto session&quot; after the close in order to override gubernatorial vetoes.

During the first half of session, the House and Senate typically meet on Wednesdays only, though by the end of the session, they meet daily due to increased workload and deadlines.

==History==

The three settlements that would become Connecticut (Hartford, Wethersfield, and Windsor) were established in 1633, and were originally governed by the Massachusetts Bay Company under terms of a commission for settlement. When the commission expired in 1636 and the Connecticut Colony was established, the legislature was established as the &quot;General Corte&quot;, consisting of six magistrates along with three-member committees representing each of the three towns. In 1639, the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut were adopted, which changed the spelling to &quot;General Court;&quot; formalized its executive, judicial, and legislative authority; and changed its membership to consist of the governor and six magistrates (each elected for one year terms) and three or four deputies per town (elected for six-month terms). Although the magistrates and deputies sat together, they voted separately and in 1645 it was decreed that a measure had to have the approval of both groups in order to pass. The Charter of 1662 changed the name to the General Assembly, while replacing the six magistrates with twelve assistants and reducing the number of deputies per town to no more than two. In 1698, the General Assembly divided itself into its current bicameral form, with the twelve assistants as the Council and the deputies as the House of Representatives. The modern form of the General Assembly (divided into the upper Senate and lower House and devoid of all executive and judicial authority) was incorporated in the 1818 constitution.

==Facilities==
Most of the General Assembly&#x27;s committee and caucus meetings are held in the modern Legislative Office Building (LOB), while the House and Senate sessions are held in the State Capitol. The two buildings are connected via a tunnel known as the &quot;Concourse&quot;, which stretches underneath an off-ramp of Interstate 84. Most offices for legislators and their aides are also housed in the LOB, though some legislative leaders choose to be based in the State Capitol itself.

Each committee has its own office space, with most being located in the LOB. A few committees, particularly select committees, have their offices in the Capitol. Committee chairs and ranking members normally choose to have their personal offices near their committee offices, rather than staying in their caucus areas.

The General Assembly is also provided with facilities such as a cafeteria, private dining room, newsstand, and library.

==Committee system==
The General Assembly has 26 committees, all of which are joint committees; that is, their membership includes House and Senate members alike. Several committees have subcommittees, each with their own chair and special focus.

Before most bills are considered in either the House or Senate, they must first go through the committee system. The primary exception to this rule is the emergency certification bill, or &quot;e-cert,&quot; which can be passed on the floor without going through committee first. The e-cert is generally reserved for use during times of crisis, such as natural disasters or when deadlines are approaching too quickly to delay action.

===Permanent committees===
Most are permanent committees, which are authorized and required by state statute to be continued each session.

The twenty-seven permanent committees of the General Assembly are:
* Aging Committee
* Appropriations Committee
* Banking Committee
* Children Committee
* Commerce Committee
* Education Committee (K–12)
* Energy and Technology Committee
* Environment Committee
* Executive and Legislative Nominations Committee
* Finance, Revenue, and Bonding Committee
* General Law Committee
* Government Administration and Elections Committee
* Government Oversight Committee
* Higher Education and Employment Advancement Committee
* Housing Committee
* Human Services Committee
* Insurance and Real Estate Committee
* Internship Committee
* Judiciary Committee
* Labor and Public Employees Committee
* Joint Committee on Legislative Management
* Planning and Development Committee
* Public Health Committee
* Public Safety and Security Committee
* Regulation Review Committee
* Transportation Committee
* Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee

Of those, the Executive and Legislative Nominations Committee, Internship Committee, Joint Committee on Legislative Management, and Regulation Review Committee are considered bi-partisan and feature leadership from each party.

===Select committees===
Some committees are select committees, authorized to only function for a set number of years before being brought up for review. Most select committees deal with issues of major importance during a particular time period and are created in response to specific problems facing the state. As of the 2025 legislative session, there is one active select committee, the Select Committee on Special Education.

===Leadership and staff===
Most committee chair positions are held by the ruling party, but committees considered officially bi-partisan have chairs from both the Republican and Democratic caucuses. Bi-partisan committees are ones that are mostly administrative in nature, such as the Legislative Internship Committee. Most committees have ranking members, or leaders from the minority party who serve as the leaders of their party on each committee.

All committees have their own staff members. The four largest committees (Appropriations, Finance, Judiciary, and Public Health) are led by non-partisan senior committee administrators. The rest are led by a committee clerk appointed by the majority party. The majority and minority party appoint assistant clerks.

Each committee is assigned additional non-partisan staffers from the Office of Legislative Research, the Office of Fiscal Analysis, and the Legislative Commissioners&#x27; Office who, respectively, research legislation and issues, assess fiscal impacts, and draft legislation.

==Subpoena power==
The General Assembly has subpoena power under Connecticut General Statutes §2-46. Recent decisions by the Connecticut Supreme Court, the state supreme court, have clarified and limited this power.

§2-46 vests the Connecticut General Assembly with broad subpoena power. The power to compel documents and testimony is vested in the President of the Senate, Speaker of the House of Representatives, or either of the chairman of any committee (Connecticut has joint Committees, with a chairman from each house of the General Assembly). Once subpoenaed, a person refusing to comply may be fined between $100 and $1000, and imprisoned for between one month and one year.

The legislature has the power to subpoena the sitting governor of Connecticut in limited circumstances. The Connecticut Supreme Court clarified these circumstances, during the John G. Rowland impeachment process, in &quot;Office of the Legislature v. The Select Committee On Inquiry&quot;, 271 Conn. 540 (2004), holding that the legislature can issue subpoenas only in conjunction with its mandate under the state constitution. Impeachment is a constitutional power of the legislature under Article IX of the Connecticut Constitution, and therefore the legislature can compel the testimony of the governor in conjunction with impeachment proceedings.

The ability of the legislature to subpoena judges of the state court has also been clarified in court. During the controversy surrounding the retirement of the chief justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court, William &quot;Taco&quot; Sullivan, the Connecticut General Assembly subpoenaed the testimony of Sullivan, who was still sitting on the Court. Sullivan challenged the subpoena in Connecticut Superior Court. The court ruled, in &quot;Sullivan v. McDonald&quot; (WL 2054052 2006), that the legislature could only subpoena a sitting Justice in an impeachment proceeding. On appeal, the entire Connecticut Supreme Court recused itself, and the argument was made before the judges of the Connecticut Appellate Court sitting as the Supreme Court. The Judiciary Committee, who issued the subpoenas, argued that they could also issue subpoenas in conjunction with their constitutional confirmation power. Sullivan voluntarily testified before a ruling was issued.

==Public participation==
The majority of General Assembly proceedings are open to members of the public. Public hearings are held regularly during the session for residents to be given a chance to testify on pending legislation. Viewing areas are offered in both chambers for people who would like to observe, though the floor of each chamber is generally restricted to legislators, staff members, interns, and certain members of the media collectively known as the Capitol Press Corps. Additionally, the Connecticut Network, or CT-N, broadcasts the majority of each session for viewing on television.

Members of the public are often recognized during legislative proceedings, particularly sessions of the House. Representatives and Senators can call for a &quot;point of personal privilege&quot; when there is no business pending on the floor, which allows them to introduce family members or residents of their districts to the rest of the membership. The entire chamber often recognizes civic and youth groups, particularly championship-winning sports teams. Some residents receive special citations from the membership as well.

<doc id="426277" wikidata="Q3103766" url="?curid=426277" title="Georgia General Assembly">
<text>The Georgia General Assembly is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Georgia. It is bicameral, consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

Each of the General Assembly&#x27;s 236 members serve two-year terms and are directly elected by constituents of their district. The Constitution of Georgia vests all legislative power with the General Assembly. Both houses have similar powers, though each has unique duties as well. For example, the origination of appropriations bills only occurs in the House, while the Senate is tasked with confirmation of the governor&#x27;s appointments.

The General Assembly meets in the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta.

==History==
The General Assembly, which is the legislative branch of the state&#x27;s government, was created in 1777 during the American Revolution—it is older than the United States Congress. During its existence the Assembly has moved four different times when the state capital changed its location. The first location of the Assembly was Savannah, then Augusta and Louisville, moving from there to Milledgeville, and finally to Atlanta in 1868.

===The General Assembly in Savannah===
By January 1777 Savannah had become the capital of Georgia—when the former colony declared independence from Britain. The legislature, then a unicameral body, met there in 1777–1778—retreating to Augusta when the British captured the city. They were not in Augusta long before it was captured by the British in 1779. Augusta changed hands three times during the war, finally returning to American possession in July 1781. They stayed in Augusta until the British left Savannah in May 1782 and the legislature returned to the capital.

===Move to Augusta===
Between 1783 and 1785, the Georgia General Assembly met in both Savannah and Augusta—moving from there when tensions arose between the two cities, causing then Governor Lyman Hall to officially reside in both places. On February 22, 1785, the General Assembly held its last meeting in Savannah—Augusta had become the official capital due to pressure from the general populace to have their capital in the center of the state.

===On to Louisville===
As the population dispersed—shifting the geographic center, it was determined that the state&#x27;s capital needed to move as well. A commission was appointed by the legislature in 1786 to find a suitable location that was central to the new demography. The commission recommended Louisville, which would become Georgia&#x27;s first planned capital and would hold her first capitol building. Due to the fact that the capital would have to be built from the ground up, and because of numerous construction delays, it took a decade to build the city. The name Louisville was chosen by the General Assembly in honor of King Louis XVI of France for France&#x27;s aid during the Revolutionary War.

The new state house, a two-story 18th century Gregorian building of red brick, was completed in 1796. The Legislature designated Louisville the &quot;permanent seat&quot; of Georgia&#x27;s government. Yet, further western expansion created the need for another new state capital. The capitol building was purchased by Jefferson County and used as a courthouse, but the building had to be torn down because it became unsound. A plaque marks the location of the old Capitol.

===The Assembly arrives in Milledgeville===

In 1804, the state government decided that yet another capital, would be needed. Subsequently, an act was passed authorizing construction of a new capital city on in the area currently known as Baldwin County. The city was named Milledgeville in honor of Governor John Milledge.

The new Capitol took two years to complete and was a brick construction in the Gothic Revival style. The legislature convened &quot;The Georgia Secession Convention of 1861&quot; in the Milledgeville statehouse on January 16, 1861. On January 19, delegates voted for Georgia to secede from the Union—208 in favor with 89 against—drafting a new constitution, and declaring the state an independent Republic.
On January 21, Assembly delegates (secessionists finishing with a slight majority of delegates) celebrated their decision by a public signing of the Ordinance of Secession outside of the State Capitol. Later that year, the legislature also voted to send $100,000 to South Carolina for &quot;the relief of Charlestonians&quot; who suffered a disastrous fire in December 1861. With General Sherman&#x27;s approach, the members of the General Assembly adjourned in fall 1864, reconvening briefly in Macon in 1865. As the American Civil War came to a close with the federal government in military control of Georgia, the legislature reconvened at the Capitol in Milledgeville.

===Atlanta===
In 1867, Major General John Pope, military governor of Georgia, called for an assembly in Atlanta to hold a constitutional convention. At that time Atlanta officials moved once again to have the city designated as Georgia&#x27;s state capital, donating the property where Atlanta&#x27;s first city hall was constructed. The constitutional convention agreed and the people voted to ratify the decision on April 20, 1868. The Georgia General Assembly first convened in Atlanta on July 4, 1868.

In 1884, the legislature appropriated one million dollars to build a new State Capitol. Construction began October 26, 1884, and the building was completed (&quot;slightly under budget&quot;) and occupied on June 15, 1889.

Notably, the dome atop the capitol building is plated with real gold, most of which came from the Dahlonega, Georgia area. The roofing gives rise to local colloquialisms—for instance, if one knowledgeable Georgian wanted to ask another what the General Assembly was doing, he might ask what was happening &quot;under the gold dome.&quot;

==Organization and procedure of the General Assembly==
The General Assembly meets in regular session on the second Monday in January for no longer than 40 legislative (rather than calendar) days each year. Neither the House nor the Senate can adjourn during a regular session for longer than three days or meet in any place other than the state capitol without the other house&#x27;s consent. The legislative session usually lasts from January until late March or early April. When the General Assembly is not sitting, legislative committees may still meet to discuss specific issues. In cases of emergency, the Governor can summon a special session of the Assembly. Days in special session do not count towards the 40-day constitutional limit.

===Committees===
Both the House and Senate are organized into various legislative committees. All bills introduced in the General Assembly will be referred to at least one committee. Committee chairs usually come from the majority party. Committee chairs determine the business of the committee, including which bills get a hearing.

===Rules of procedure, employees and interim committees===
Each house of the General Assembly may determine procedural rules governing its own employees. The General Assembly as a whole, or each house separately, has the ability to create interim committees.

At the beginning of each two-year term, the House elects a speaker, who is always from the majority party. Unlike in the federal House of Representatives, the speaker usually presides over sittings of the House. There is also a speaker pro tempore, who presides in the absence of the speaker.

The Lieutenant Governor of Georgia is the ex officio &quot;president&quot; of the State Senate. The lieutenant governor is elected for a four-year term in a statewide vote along with the governor. The lieutenant governor does not have the power to introduce legislation.

===Oath of office===
Before taking office senators and representatives must swear (or affirm) an oath—stipulated by state law.

===Legislative procedure===
A majority of the members to which each house is entitled constitutes a quorum to transact business. A smaller number may adjourn from day to day and compel the presence of its absent members. In order for a bill to become law, it must be passed by both chambers of the General Assembly, and receive the governor&#x27;s signature. In each chamber, the number of votes required to pass a bill is determined according to the number of seats in the chamber, not merely the number of votes cast. Therefore, a bill must receive 91 votes in the House (a majority of its membership) and 29 votes in the Senate, regardless of the number of legislators voting. In the case of a tie, the presiding officer of each chamber may cast the deciding vote.

Some motions require more than an absolute majority to pass. A resolution to amend the state constitution, for instance, requires a two-thirds vote in both chambers (121 votes in the House and 38 votes in the Senate).

All senators and representatives are entitled to introduce bills and resolutions. Bills are intended to have the force of law, while resolutions may or may not have any practical effect. Bills and resolutions are referred to a legislative committee by the presiding officer as soon as they are introduced. The presiding officer has discretion to refer a bill to any committee he or she chooses, although the chamber may vote to move a bill to a different committee.

Committee chairs determine which bills will be heard in committee. Bills that do not get a committee hearing cannot proceed, and the majority of bills die in committee this way. Because most committee chairs are from the majority party, bills that are introduced by members of the majority are much more likely to be heard. The vast majority of legislation considered by the Assembly is introduced by the majority party. Committees will hear testimony from a bill&#x27;s sponsor, as well as experts in the public and private sectors and concerned citizens. Members of the committee may ask questions of the sponsor. Committees usually amend bills under their consideration; an amended version of a bill is known as a &quot;substitute.&quot; Once the committee is done debating, it will vote on the bill, as well as any proposed amendments. If the bill is approved, it is transmitted to the Committee on Rules.

Both the House and Senate have a Rules committee. The House Committee on Rules meets early in the morning on most legislative days to determine which bills will get a floor vote that day. Power in House Rules is highly centralized, and the committee usually acts as a rubber stamp for decisions already made by the chairperson, the speaker, and even the governor. The Senate Committee on Rules meets after each legislative day, to determine the agenda for the next legislative day.

For the first 28 days in a legislative session, the House and Senate only consider legislation introduced by their own members. After the 28th day, bills passed by one chamber will &quot;cross over&quot; to the other, hence why the day is known as &quot;Crossover Day.&quot; After Crossover Day, no new bills will be considered. If a bill, after having crossed over to the other chamber, is amended in committee on on the floor, it will have to return to the original chamber for final approval. Further amendments may be made, and the bill will move back and forth until both chambers agree. If the two chambers cannot agree on the final version of a bill by the end of the session, the bill is not passed.

===Vacancies===
Whenever a vacancy occurs in the General Assembly, an event that occurs whenever a member dies, resigns, or moves from the district from which he was elected, it is filled according to Georgia law and the Constitution. If the vacancy occurs anytime prior to the end of the legislative session in the second year of a term, the governor must issue a writ of special election within ten days of the vacancy occurring, and, if the vacancy occurs after the end of the legislative session in the second year of a term, then the governor may choose to issue a writ of special election. But, if the vacancy exists at the time that an extraordinary session is called, then the governor must issue a writ of special election within 2 days after the call for the extraordinary session, and, if the vacancy occurs after the call but before the special session has concluded, then the governor must issue a writ of special election within 5 days of the occurrence. In each case, the writ of special election must designate a day on which the election will be held, which must be no less than 30 days and no more than 60 days after the governor issues the writ.

===Salaries===
Members of the General Assembly receive salaries provided by law, so long as that salary does not increase before the end of the term during which the increase becomes effective. Members of the Georgia General Assembly currently earn $17,000 a year.

===Election and returns; disorderly conduct===
Each house holds the responsibility of judging the election, returns, and qualifications of its own members. Also, each house has the power to punish its own members for disorderly misconduct. Punishments for such conduct include:

*censure
*fine
*imprisonment
*expulsion

However, no member may be expelled except upon a two-thirds vote of the house in which he or she sits.

===Contempt===
When a person is guilty of contempt, the individual may be imprisoned if ordered by either the House or the Senate.

===Elections by either house===
All elections of the General Assembly are to be recorded. The recorded vote then appears in the journal of each house.

===Open meetings===
Sessions of the General Assembly, including committee meetings, are open to the public except when either house makes an exception.

===Legislative history===
The General Assembly does not publish reports and does not keep bill files. Major legislation is discussed in detail in the &quot;Peach Sheets&quot;, a student-written part of Georgia State University College of Law&#x27;s Law Review. Recent &quot;Peach Sheet&quot; articles are available in an online archive. Otherwise, &quot;Peach Sheets&quot; articles should be included in the Georgia State Law Review databases on Lexis, Westlaw and HeinOnline.

==Composition==

The Georgia General Assembly began in 1777 as a body consisting of the lower House of Assembly to which counties elected two members each, and an Executive Council, which included a councillor elected by their respective Assembly delegation. After the enactment of the Georgia Constitution of 1789, the body was changed to a bicameral legislature of a Senate and House of Representatives, both to be directly elected. From 1789 to 1795, senators were elected every three years, and after the enactment of the May 1795 Constitution, senators were elected annually to one-year terms. Senators were moved to two-terms after December 5, 1843.

It is now made up of a Senate (the upper house) and a House of Representatives (the lower house). The Senate has 56 members while the House of Representatives has 180. Members from each body serve for two years, but have no limit to the number of times they can be re-elected. Both senators and representatives are elected from their constituents&#x27; districts.

===Qualifications for election===
The Georgia Constitution stipulates that members of the Senate must be citizens of the United States, at least 25 years old, a citizen of the state of Georgia at least two years, and a legal resident of the district the senator was elected to. Members of the House of Representatives must be citizens of the United States, at least 21 years old, a Georgia citizen for at least two years, and a legal resident of the district the representative was elected for at least one year.

===Disqualifications===
According to the Georgia Constitution Article III Section II Paragraph IV:
* No person on active duty with any branch of the armed forces of the United States shall have a seat in either house unless otherwise provided by law.
* No person holding any civil appointment or office having any emolument annexed thereto under the United States, this state, or any other state shall have a seat in either house.
* No Senator or Representative shall be elected by the General Assembly or appointed by the Governor to any office or appointment having any emolument annexed thereto during the time for which such person shall have been elected unless the Senator or Representative shall first resign the seat to which elected; provided, however, that, during the term for which elected, no Senator or Representative shall be appointed to any civil office which has been created during such term.

===Officers===
The presiding officer of the Senate is the President of the Senate or Lieutenant Governor. Like the United States Senate, a President Pro Tempore is elected by the Senate from among its members. The President Pro Tempore acts as president in case of the temporary disability of the President. In case of the death, resignation, or permanent disability of the President or in the event of the succession of the President to the executive power, the President Pro Tempore becomes President. The Senate also has as an officer the Secretary of the Senate.

The House of Representatives elects its own Speaker and a Speaker Pro Tempore. The Speaker Pro Tempore becomes Speaker in case of the death, resignation, or permanent disability of the Speaker. The Speaker Pro Tempore serves until a new Speaker is elected. The House also has as an officer the Clerk of the House of Representatives.

===Historic composition===
The 1866 Constitution called for 22 seats in the Senate and 175 seats in the House. The 1877 Constitution expanded the Senate to 44 seats while keeping 175 members in the House.

==Powers and privileges==
Article III Section VI of the Georgia State Constitution specifies the powers given to the Georgia General Assembly. Paragraph I states, &quot;The General Assembly shall have the power to make all laws not inconsistent with this Constitution, and not repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, which it shall deem necessary and proper for the welfare of the state.&quot; Moreover, the powers the Constitution gives the Assembly include land use restrictions to protect and preserve the environment and natural resources; the creation, use and disciplining through court martial of a state militia which would be under the command of the Governor of Georgia acting as commander-in-chief (excepting times when the militia is under Federal command); The power to expend public money, to condemn property, and to zone property; The continuity of state and local governments during times of emergency; state participation in tourism. The use, control and regulation of outdoor advertising within the state.

===Limitation of powers===
Paragraph V of Article III Section VI states that:

*The General Assembly shall not have the power to grant incorporation to private persons but shall provide by general law the manner in which private corporate powers and privileges may be granted.
*The General Assembly shall not forgive the forfeiture of the charter of any corporation existing on August 13, 1945, nor shall it grant any benefit to or permit any amendment to the charter of any corporation except upon the condition that the acceptance thereof shall operate as a novation of the charter and that such corporation shall thereafter hold its charter subject to the provisions of this Constitution.
*The General Assembly shall not have the power to authorize any contract or agreement which may have the effect of or which is intended to have the effect of defeating or lessening competition, or encouraging a monopoly, which are hereby declared to be unlawful and void.
*The General Assembly shall not have the power to regulate or fix charges of public utilities owned or operated by any county or municipality of this state, except as authorized by this Constitution.
*No municipal or county authority which is authorized to construct, improve, or maintain any road or street on behalf of, pursuant to a contract with, or through the use of taxes or other revenues of a county or municipal corporation shall be created by any local Act or pursuant to any general Act nor shall any law specifically relating to any such authority be amended unless the creation of such authority or the amendment of such law is conditioned upon the approval of a majority of the qualified voters of the county or municipal corporation affected voting in a referendum thereon. This subparagraph shall not apply to or affect any state authority.

===Privileges of members===
Members of the Georgia General Assembly maintain two important privileges during their time in office. First, no member of either house of the Assembly can be arrested during sessions of the General Assembly or during committee meetings except in cases of treason, felony, or &quot;breach of the peace&quot;. Also, members are not liable for anything they might say in either the House or the Senate or in any committee meetings of both.

<text>The North Carolina General Assembly is the bicameral legislature of the state government of North Carolina. The legislature consists of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives. The General Assembly meets in the North Carolina State Legislative Building in Raleigh.

The General Assembly drafts and legislates the state laws of North Carolina, also known as the &quot;General Statutes&quot;. The General Assembly is a bicameral legislature, consisting of the North Carolina House of Representatives (formerly called the North Carolina House of Commons until 1868) and the North Carolina Senate. Since 1868, the House has had 120 members, while the Senate has had 50 members. There are no term limits for either chamber.

Both chambers have two-year terms and are currently controlled by the Republican Party, but they only hold veto power in the Senate, holding 1 seat shy of a supermajority in the House of Representatives.

==History==
===Colonial period===

In 1663, King Charles II of England granted a royal charter to eight lords proprietor to establish the colony of Carolina in North America. Under the terms of the charter, regular management of the colony was to be overseen by a governor and a council. An assembly consisting of two representatives from each county elected by freeholders was to have the power to write laws with the approval of the governor, his council, and the lords proprietor. This system of government was ultimately never implemented in the area which eventually became North Carolina. In early 1665 the lords proprietor promulgated a constitution for Carolina, the &quot;Concessions and Agreement&quot;. The document provided for a governor, a council of six to 10 men chosen by the governor with the consent of the lords, and an elected assembly. It also stipulated that the assembly&#x27;s consent was required for taxes to be levied and that vacancies in the assembly were to be filled by elections called by the governor and his council. A new royal charter for Carolina was granted in 1665 and required the forming of an assembly.

After receiving his commission, Carolina Governor William Drummond summoned a body of freemen who selected 12 deputies to represent their interests. Together with the governor and his council, the deputies served as a provisional legislature for Albemarle County and eventually was named the General Court and Committee. It held its first meeting in the spring of 1665. When the governor and his deputy were absent, the assembly would designate a president or speaker to lead its sessions. Approximately two years later, the temporary assembly divided the county into four precincts: Chowan, Currituck, Pasquotank, and Perquimans. The freemen in each county were to convene at the beginning of every year to elect five representatives for the permanent assembly. The first election occurred on January 1, 1668.

While required to abide by the &quot;Concessions&quot; and support the interests of the lords proprietor, the assembly was powerful and largely left to manage itself. It decided the length and locations of its own sessions, when it adjourned, and its own quorum. It wrote laws, levied taxes, created courts, incorporated towns, determined the sites of ports and forts, regulated the militia, allotted land, and granted citizenship. Laws passed by the legislature held effect for 18 months and were sent to England for ratification by the lords. The lords could refuse to ratify laws and let them expire. From 1692 to 1712, North Carolina and South Carolina were organized as one Province of Carolina. The colony had one governor but North Carolina retained its own council and assembly. After 1731, the members of the governor&#x27;s council were chosen by the Privy Council and were responsible to the British king.
During the period of royal control after 1731, North Carolina&#x27;s governors were issued sets of secret instructions from the Privy Council&#x27;s Board of Trade. The directives were binding upon the governor and dealt with nearly all aspects of colonial government. As they were produced by officials largely ignorant of the political situation in the colony and meant to ensure greater direct control over the territory, the instructions caused tensions between the governor and the General Assembly. The assembly controlled the colony&#x27;s finances and used this as leverage by withholding salaries and appropriations, sometimes forcing the governors to compromise and disregard some of the Board of Trade&#x27;s instructions. Particularly after 1760, the lower house increasingly viewed itself as the representative of the colonists&#x27; interests in opposition to the British Crown&#x27;s interests as relayed by the governor and the council. Frequent tensions between Governor Josiah Martin—a firm supporter of the secret instructions—and the Assembly in the 1770s led the latter to establish a committee of correspondence and accelerated the colony&#x27;s break with Great Britain.

===Revolution and early statehood===

In 1774, the people of the colony elected a provincial congress, independent of the royal governor, as the American Revolution began. Inspired by the structure of the lower house of the General Assembly and organized in part by House Speaker John Harvey, its purpose was to chose delegates to send to the Continental Congress. In addition to this, the congress adopted punitive measures against Great Britain for its Intolerable Acts and empowered local committees to govern the state as royal control dissipated. A second congress in April 1775 adopted additional economic measures against Great Britain, leading Governor Martin to dissolve the colonial assembly before fleeing the colony. There would be five provincial congresses. The fifth Congress approved the first constitution in 1776. This constitution was not submitted to a vote of the people. The Congress simply adopted it and elected Richard Caswell, the last president of the Congress, as acting governor until the new legislature was elected and seated.

Per the terms of the constitution, North Carolina had a government with a separation of powers divided amongst executive, legislative, and judicial branches, though the legislative branch retained the most power. The General Assembly, vested with the state&#x27;s legislative power, was made a bicameral body, consisting of a Senate made up of one member from each county in the state and a House of Commons with two members from each county and one from each of several specially-designated &quot;borough towns&quot;. As such, the size of the legislature would grow with the addition of new counties and borough towns. Property requirements stipulated that House members had to own at least 100 acres and senators at least 300 to serve. Elections for members of both houses were to beheld annually, and each house was responsible for electing its own officers. The assembly was responsible for electing the governor, other executive officers, and all judges. The first North Carolina General Assembly was convened on April 7, 1777, in New Bern, North Carolina.

Due to the outbreak of hostilities and in an effort to present itself to the public, North Carolina&#x27;s legislature met in various locations throughout the war, though most often in New Bern, Halifax, and Hillsborough. In September 1781, British forces captured the governor and several members of the General Assembly during a raid on Hillsborough. The war ended in 1783. 

The General Assembly&#x27;s governance of the state was virtually unchallenged until 1787, when the North Carolina Superior Court found a state law in violation of the state constitution in the case &quot;Bayard vs. Singleton&quot; and overturned it, thus helping to establish a principal of judicial review. In 1791, the General Assembly appointed a commission to designate permanent seat of state government, and the following year the legislature fixed the seat at the planned city of Raleigh. Construction of a North Carolina State House began in Raleigh in 1792 and became the meeting place for the General Assembly in 1794. It was enlarged in 1820 and burnt down in 1831. The legislature convened in the governor&#x27;s residence in the interim and briefly considered relocating their seat before appropriating money to erect a new capitol in Raleigh. The North Carolina State Capitol was completed in 1840.

In 1834 the General Assembly voted narrowly in favor of a measure to establish a convention to amend the state constitution. The subsquent convention in 1835 offered significant changes to the state&#x27;s constitution which were ratified in a popular referendum. Amendments set the number of senators at 50 and the number of commoners (representatives to the House) at 120. Senate districts were no longer required to be limited to individual counties, but instead be coterminous with which counties were to be included in it and based on a judgement of approximate wealth measured by tax receipts. Sessions for the legislature were changed from annual to biennial. The terms of legislators were also lengthened accordingly to two years. The office of governor was also made popularly elective. In 1850, property requirements for qualifying to vote in Senate races were abolished.

In May 1861, at the urging of the governor, the General Assembly passed a resolution calling for the establishment of a convention to consider seceding from the United States. Later that month the convention met in Raleigh and adopted an Ordinance of Secession and adopted the Constitution of the Confederate States. The convention met several times from then until November 1862, during which time it served as a transitional government for the state, superseding the authority of the General Assembly and making changes to state law on its own. After the president of the convention declined to convene it to discuss issues of wartime speculation and extortion, authority returned to the state&#x27;s other civil leaders and institutions. During the Civil War the General Assembly continued to meet in regular biennial sessions, but also convened in seven extraordinary sessions to address wartime issues.

===Reconstruction Era===
In 1868, a new constitution was crafted by a convention and ratified by popular vote. The document provided for universal male suffrage and abolished all property requirements and religious tests for officeholders. It changed the name of the House of Commons to the House of Representatives. The constitution also created the office of lieutenant governor which was to be filled by popular statewide election. It replaced the speaker of the Senate as that body&#x27;s presiding officer and assumed the former office&#x27;s role in succeeding to the governorship in the event it became vacant. Property qualifications for holding office were abolished in order to enlarge opportunity. Finally, the legislature made executive officers and judges subject to popular election rather than appointment by the legislature. It also reverted legislative sessions from a biennial schedule to annual.

African-American men were first elected to the state legislature in 1868, including Henry Epps, Abraham H. Galloway, and John A. Hyman in the Senate and Parker D. Robbins, Wilson Cary Nicholas, B. W. Morris, A. W. Stevens, John S. Leary, Isham Sweat, Henry C. Cherry, John H. Williamson, A.A. Crawford, Cuffie Mayo, W. T. J. Hayes, Ivey Hutchings, John S. W. Eagles, George W. Price, Thomas A. Sykes, James H. Harris, William Cawthorn, and Richard Falkner in the House. Despite efforts by Red Shirts and other white Democratic paramilitary groups to disrupt Republican meetings and suppress black voting in order to ensure the Democratic takeover, some African Americans continued to be elected in the 19th century, especially to local offices. Between 1868 and 1900, 113 blacks were elected to the House of Representatives. But shortly before the turn of the century, the Democrats regained control of the state legislature (after a biracial coalition between Republicans and Populists had briefly held power) and passed laws to create barriers to voter registration through poll taxes, literacy tests and other devices.

Applied subjectively by white administrators, these methods effectively disenfranchised most black people in the state. Black voters were eliminated by 1904. An estimated 75,000 black male citizens lost the vote. African Americans were closed out of politics in North Carolina for decades, with most not regaining the ability to vote until after passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and federal overview and enforcement.

===20th century===
Lillian Exum Clement became the first female member of the General Assembly when she joined the House of Representatives in 1921. Gertrude Dills McKee became the first woman to be elected to the State Senate in 1930. Female representation slowly increased in the following decades.

The General Assembly began increasing the length of its sessions and hiring more support staff in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1959, the General Assembly organized a commission to design and fund a new, larger meeting place to accommodate the body, its staff, and improve the delivery of services to the legislators. Construction began in 1961 and was completed by early 1963. The General Assembly held its first session in the new North Carolina State Legislative Building on February 6. In 1967, legislative committees began keeping records of their minutes. In 1968, the General Assembly, in tandem with national trends towards state legislative professionalization, hired its first legislative services officer, initially dubbed its administrative officer. The following year the Assembly by law created the Legislative Services Commission to oversee the legislative services officer and the administrative affairs of its operations. The 1969 session also marked the first time the body used a computer to keep records of its bills and track their progress.

For hundreds of years North Carolina&#x27;s legislative representation was apportioned such that each county had at least one representative in the House and that all Senate districts were supposed to contain approximately equal populations, though the latter tenant was undermined by a constitutional requirement that no counties be split between different districts. As a result, by the 1960s, rural constituents were significantly overrepresented in the legislature. Following developments in federal jurisprudence in the early 1960s that led to the creation of the principle of one man, one vote, in 1965 a U.S. District Court panel ruled that the state&#x27;s legislative districts were unconstitutional. As a result, in the 1960s and 1970s the legislature designed districts in a manner which significantly rebalanced the representation of the state in a more equitable manner. Henry Frye became the state&#x27;s first black legislator in the 20th century when he joined the House of Representatives in 1969. The number of black legislators steadily increased in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1973, Henry Ward Oxendine became the first Native American member of the legislature.

In the early 1970s, Democratic legislators, spurred in part by the election of a Republican governor in 1972, began an effort to strengthen the General Assembly&#x27;s power and influence in state government which continued into the 1980s. As a result, the legislature hired its own research staff, created an independent judicial office to review administrative affairs in the state bureaucracy, and began appointing its own members to state board and commissions, though the latter practice was ruled unconstitutional by the North Carolina Supreme Court in 1982. In 1977, the state constitution was amended to allow for governors and lieutenant governors to seek second terms. Shortly thereafter, the House, feeling threatened by the strengthened positions of the governor and Senate leadership, broke from a decades-long trend and began electing speakers to successive terms. In the mid-1980s, the legislature ceased using multi-member legislative districts. In 1994, Daniel F. McComas became the first Latino elected to the General Assembly.

== Membership ==
The General Assembly has 170 elected members, with 120 members of the North Carolina House of Representatives and 50 members of the North Carolina Senate. Each represents a district. Each house has the sole power to judge the election and qualification of its own respective members. Legislators&#x27; are elected biennially in even-numbered years. Their terms of office begin at the start of the January following the year of their election. There are no term limits for legislators. All legislators swear a state constitutionally-prescribed oath of office. In the event of the vacancy of a seat, the governor is constitutionally obligated to appoint a person nominated by the previous incumbent&#x27;s political party&#x27;s respective district executive committee to fill the seat.

The assembly is styled after the citizen legislature model, with legislating considered a part-time job. Members receive a base salary of $13,951 per year, supplemented by per-diem payments and travel reimbursements. Increases in legislative pay adopted by the assembly cannot take effect until after a succeeding election.

==Structure and process==

Each house of the legislature has eight leadership roles. The Senate&#x27;s leadership is made up of the president of the Senate, president &quot;pro tempore&quot;, majority leader, majority whip, majority caucus chair, minority leader, minority whip, and minority caucus chair. Per the constitution, the office of president of the Senate is held &quot;ex officio&quot; by the lieutenant governor. In this capacity they direct the debate on bills and maintain order in that house, but have little influence over its workflow. They cannot cast a vote in the Senate except to break ties. The president &quot;pro tempore&quot; is elected by the full Senate. They appoint the body&#x27;s committees. All other leadership positions are filled by the decision of party caucuses.

The leadership of House of Representatives is analogous to that in the Senate, except that in place of a president and president &quot;pro tempore&quot;, the body is led by a speaker and speaker &quot;pro tempore&quot;. The speaker is in charge of appointing the body&#x27;s committees. Both officers are elected by the full house from among its members, with the rest determined by party caucuses. In the event of an even political divide in the House, co-speakers may be elected in lieu of a single speaker.

Both houses appoint a principal clerk—who keeps their respective bodies&#x27; records, a reading clerk—who reads documents as required by the constitution, house rules, or the presiding officer, and a sergeant at arms—who maintains order in their house. Standing committees in each house consider introduced legislation, hold hearings, and offer amendments. All bills are examined by a body&#x27;s respective rules committee before being brought before a full house for a vote.

== Powers ==
The constitution of North Carolina vests the state&#x27;s legislative power in the General Assembly; the General Assembly writes state laws/statutes. Legislation in North Carolina can either be in the form of general laws or special/local laws. General laws apply to the entire state, while local laws apply only to specific counties or municipalities. The constitution requires that all effective laws be styled &quot;The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts:&quot;, with only the words following that phrase being legally operative. The legally valid language of each passed bill is punctuated by the ratification certificate, consisting of the obligatory signatures of the presiding officers of each house. Most laws have an &quot;effective date&quot; which stipulate the time they go into effect. Those that do not have an explicit stipulation go into effect 60 days after the assembly&#x27;s adjournment &quot;sine die&quot;.

The assembly has the power to levy taxes and adopts the state budget. The constitution enumerates a unique procedure for the passing of revenue legislation; all revenue bills must be read three times with each reading occurring on a different day, journal records of votes must include the name of each legislator and how they voted, and all revenue bills must appropriate money for a specific purpose. The assembly is also responsible for drawing the districts of its own members and the districts of the state&#x27;s congressional delegation after every decennial U.S. census. The legislative power of the assembly must be exercised by the whole body and not devolved upon a portion of the whole, and actions taken during one session of the assembly can be undone by a succeeding session. The governor signs bills passed by the General Assembly of which they approve into law and are empowered to veto bills of which they disapprove. A veto can be overridden by a three-fifths majority vote of the assembly. Local bills and congressional and legislative reapportionment decisions are not subject to gubernatorial veto. Aside from regular legislation, the two houses of the General Assembly can also issue joint resolutions which are not subject to veto.

The assembly wields oversight authority over the state&#x27;s administrative bureaucracy. It can alter gubernatorial executive orders concerning the organization of state agencies by joint resolution. Its Joint Legislative Commission on Governmental Operations has the authority to seize state agency documents and inspect facilities of agencies and contractors with the state. All legislative committees are empowered to subpoena the testimony of witnesses and documents. The constitution allows for the General Assembly to provide for the filling of executive offices not already provided for in the constitution. The body is also empowered to resolve contested elections for state executive officers by joint ballot. Its advice and consent is required for the installation of some state agency heads. The assembly can also influence the bureaucracy through its power to create or dissolve agencies or countermand administrative rules by writing laws and by its decisions in appropriations. The constitution empowers the House of Representatives to impeach elected state officials by simple majority vote. In the event an official is impeached, the Senate holds a trial, and can convict an official by two-thirds majority vote and remove them from office. The General Assembly can also, by a two-thirds majority vote, determine the governor or a judge mentally or physically incapable of serving.

The General Assembly has the sole power to propose amendments to the state constitution. If a proposed amendment receives the support of three-fifths of the House and the Senate, it is scheduled for ratification by a statewide referendum. State constitutional amendments and state legislative votes on the ratification of federal constitutional amendments are not subject to gubernatorial veto.

==Sessions==

The General Assembly&#x27;s sessions are convened according to standards prescribed by the state constitution and state statute. The General Assembly meets in regular session—or the &quot;long session&quot;—beginning in January of each odd-numbered year, and adjourns to reconvene the following even-numbered year for what is called the &quot;short session&quot;. Though there is no limit on the length of any session, the &quot;long session&quot; typically lasts for 6 months, and the &quot;short session&quot; typically lasts for 6 weeks. The legislature crafts its biennial state budget during the &quot;long session&quot; and typically only makes modifications to it during the &quot;short session&quot;. Typically the legislature adjourns shortly after June 30, the end of North Carolina&#x27;s fiscal year, following the passing of a budget. The governor may call the General Assembly into extraordinary session after consulting the Council of State and is required to convene the assembly in specific circumstances to review vetoed legislation. A majority of the Council of State can call the legislature into session to consider the governor&#x27;s mental capacity to serve.

A basic majority of the members of a house constitute a quorum to do business. When in session, both Houses of the legislature typically meet on Monday evenings and in the middle of the day on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Legislative committees usually convene in the mornings and late afternoons. Committees sometimes meet when their house is not in session. Both houses are empowered to temporarily adjourn for three days or less at their own discretion. The proceedings of each house are constitutionally-required to be reported in official journals and published at the end of each session. Official transcripts of debates on the floors of the House and Senate are not produced, though audio of their sessions is recorded as well as the minutes of committee meetings. The records of individual lawmakers are not subject to the state&#x27;s public records law. Each house chamber has a gallery from which members of the public can attend and observe sessions.

== Administration and support agencies ==

Administrative support of the General Assembly is overseen by the Legislative Services Commission, a panel comprising five members of each house. As of October 2023, the assembly relies on over 600 support staff who work in the Legislative Building and the Legislative Office Building. Daily operations of the legislature&#x27;s facilities are directed by the legislative services officer. Every legislator is assigned at least one legislative assistant or clerk, who manage legislators&#x27; schedules, relay communications with constituents, and offer advice on policy issues. Some legislators employ additional staff. The General Assembly&#x27;s members and facilities are guarded by the North Carolina General Assembly Police. The North Carolina Legislative Library serves as a repository of legislative documents and facilitates research for legislators and their staff.

<text>The Ohio General Assembly is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Ohio. It consists of the 99-member Ohio House of Representatives and the 33-member Ohio Senate. Both houses of the General Assembly meet at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus.

==Legislative agencies==
The Legislative Service Commission is one of several legislative agencies. It serves as a source for legal expertise and staffing and drafts proposed legislation, also helps serve as an advertisement to the general public as to what is happening inside the assembly.

==History==

The General Assembly first convened in Chillicothe, then the Ohio capital, on March 1, 1803.

The second constitution of Ohio, effective in 1851, took away the power of the General Assembly to choose the state&#x27;s executive officers, granting that right to the voters. A complicated formula apportioned legislators to Ohio counties and the number of seats in the legislative houses varied from year-to-year.

&quot;The Ohio Politics Almanac&quot; by Michael F. Curtin (Kent State University Press) described apportionment thus:

The new [1851] constitution ... contained a complicated formula for apportionment, the so-called &quot;major fraction rule.&quot; Under it, the state&#x27;s population was divided by 100, with the resulting quotient being the ratio of representation in the House of Representatives. Any county with a population equal to at least half the ratio was entitled to one representative; a county with a population of less than half the ratio was grouped with an adjacent county for districting; a county containing a population of at least one and three-fourths the ratio was entitled to two representatives; a county with a population equal to three times the ratio was entitled to three representatives. To determine Senate districts, a similar procedure was followed; the starting point, however was figured by dividing the state&#x27;s population by 35. The ratios for the House and Senate and the resulting apportionment was determined by a board consisting of the governor, auditor, and secretary of state.

In 1903, the apportionment system was modified by the Hanna amendment, which also gave the governor veto power over the assembly&#x27;s acts, which could be overridden by a two-thirds vote of both houses. The last state constitutional convention, held in 1912, gave the governor a line-item veto, but reduced the supermajority required for overriding the veto to three-fifths. In 1956, a referendum increased the terms of state senators from two to four years.

The Hanna amendment (which guaranteed each county at least one representative and all members elected at large) guaranteed that rural areas of Ohio would dominate the legislature. However, several decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court surrounding the legal principal of one man, one vote mandated apportionment proportional to population. Reapportionment was ordered in 1964. Starting with the 1966 election, the number of seats in the two chambers were fixed at their present numbers of 33 and 99.

Republican activists, led by Fred A. Lennon, began pursuing term limits in the 1980s, in 1992, a referendum set term limits of eight consecutive years in office: four consecutive terms in the House or two consecutive terms in the Senate. Years in office are considered consecutive if they are separated by less than four years. A former member of the legislature who had served eight years becomes eligible for election to the legislature after four years out of office.

== Vacancies ==
The Ohio House and Ohio Senate use slightly different methods to fill vacant seats. In both chambers, a replacement is first elected by the members of the relevant chamber who are affiliated with the same party as the departing member. In the House, the replacement will serve for the remainder of the term. In the Senate, the replacement will serve for the remainder of the term only if the vacancy occurred after the first 20 months of the four-year Senate term. If the vacancy occurred during the first 20 months of the term, then a special election will be held during the next regularly-scheduled even-year statewide election. The replacement selected by the party members will then serve until the end of December following the special election, with the winner serving the remainder of the term.

<doc id="426293" wikidata="Q3567567" url="?curid=426293" title="Montana Legislature">
<text>The Montana State Legislature is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Montana. It is composed of the 100-member Montana House of Representatives and the 50-member Montana Senate.

The Montana Constitution dictates that the legislature meet in regular session for no longer than 90 days in each odd-numbered year. The primary work of the legislature is to pass a balanced biennial budget which must then be approved by the governor. If the governor vetoes a bill, the legislature may override the veto by a two-thirds vote.

Since the beginning of statehood for Montana, the Legislature has been split along party lines fairly consistently and evenly. Since adoption of the current state constitution in 1972, which mandated single-member legislative districts for the first time in the state&#x27;s history, the Montana Senate has been controlled by Democrats in 9 sessions and Republicans in 16 sessions. During the same period, the Montana House has been controlled by Democrats in 8 sessions and Republicans in 15 sessions, with two ties. According to state law, in the instance of a tie, control goes to the party of the sitting governor. The 67th Legislature (2021–2022) was controlled by the Republican Party with the House having 67 Republican members and 33 Democratic members; the Senate has 31 Republican and 19 Democratic members.

The 68th Legislature (2023-2024) was controlled by a Republican &quot;supermajority,&quot; meaning that Republicans controlled two-thirds of the seats in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, allowing them to override gubernatorial vetoes and potentially pass proposals for amendments to the Montana Constitution.

Members are limited to serving no more than eight years in either chamber, but the term limit is consecutive, not lifetime.

Legislative districts are redrawn every ten years, after each census. The new boundaries, after the 2020 census, became effective starting with the 2024 elections.

The Montana State Legislature meets in the state capitol in Helena.

<doc id="426294" wikidata="Q7679673" url="?curid=426294" title="Talk Soup">
<text>Talk Soup is a television show produced for cable network E! that debuted on January 7, 1991, and aired until August 2002. &quot;Talk Soup&quot; aired selected clips of the previous day&#x27;s daily talk shows—ranging from daytime entries like &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot; to celebrity interview shows like &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;—surrounded by humorous commentary delivered by the host. Although &quot;Talk Soup&quot; poked fun at the talk shows, it also advertised the topics and guests of upcoming broadcasts. Despite this, several talk shows, including &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, refused to allow clips of their shows to be shown on the series. During its run, &quot;Talk Soup&quot; was nominated for five Daytime Emmy Awards, winning once in 1995 for Outstanding Special Class Program. A show based on it, &quot;The Soup&quot;, aired from 2004 to 2015.

The show frequently poked fun at actors Randolph Mantooth and Mario Van Peebles. Also featured was a womanizing Argentine sock puppet named Señor Sock that had bought several ThighMasters because he was madly in love with Suzanne Somers.

==Hosts==
* Greg Kinnear (1991–1995)
* John Henson (1995–1999)
* Hal Sparks (1999–2000)
* Aisha Tyler (2001–2002)

The show had number of guest hosts over the years, including Roseanne Barr, Brad Garrett, Juliette Lewis, Patrick Warburton, Sarah Silverman, Suzanne Somers, Jon Hamm, Julia Sweeney, Kevin Nealon, Robert McRay, David Brenner, Crow T. Robot, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Jerry Springer, Adam Carolla, Dr. Drew Pinsky, Jimmy Kimmel, Tom Arnold, Roger Lodge, Catherine O&#x27;Hara, Teri Garr, David Spade, Donna D&#x27;Errico, Richard Lewis, George Hamilton, Wayne Brady, Rolonda Watts, French Stewart, Sally Jessy Raphael, and Kato Kaelin.

==Episodes==
In 1993, the show was part of an episode of the CBS show &quot;48 Hours&quot; with Dan Rather. The program was about the proliferation of talk shows on the TV landscape and featured a behind-the-scenes segment with the Talk Soup staff and host Kinnear.

Later that same year, the show taped a series of shows at the Disney/MGM Studios at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. It was the first time the show was done in front of a live studio audience. During its run at Disney, the show premiered Talk Soup: The Motion Picture. Technically not a feature film but rather a grand trailer, it included Kinnear running in the middle of a crowded Wilshire Boulevard, throwing a staffer off the top of the E! building and being run over by a car in front of E! personality Arthel Neville.

Talk show guests were not the only ones the show skewered. Footage of Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s mother, Jackie Stallone, eating shrimp at an event covered by E! News was comic fodder for the show.

Celebrities who appeared in sketches and walk-on appearances include Eric Idle, David Duchovny, Danny Aiello, Montel Williams, Adam West, Jonathan Harris, Neil Norman and his Cosmic Orchestra, Florence Henderson, Danny Bonaduce, Phil Hartman, Joan Collins, Billy Barty, George Foreman, Sugar Ray Leonard, Kristi Yamaguchi, Scott Hamilton, Ed Asner, Sherman Hemsley, Soupy Sales, Gary Coleman, Jenna Jameson, Robin Givens, Dawn Wells, The Moffatts and the cast of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

==Awards==
The show won an Emmy for Outstanding Special Class Program in 1995. It has also been nominated for four other Daytime Emmys and three CableAce awards.

==&quot;The Soup&quot;==

In 2004, E! leveraged the &quot;Talk Soup&quot; brand by renaming and reformatting &quot;The What The? Awards&quot; to create the show known today as &quot;The Soup&quot; with actor Joel McHale as host and co-writer, which aired until December 18, 2015.

One remnant from &quot;Talk Soup&quot; that carried over to &quot;The Soup&quot; is the &quot;Chat Stew&quot; segment which shows clips from various talk shows and funny comments. The segment is introduced with a CGI crock pot filled with talk show logos and host heads, while a woman (announcer Kelly Andrews) voices about the &quot;stew&quot; being &quot;so meaty!&quot;

On an episode of &quot;The Soup&quot; in January 2009, John Henson, a former host of &quot;Talk Soup&quot;, appeared as a guest star to promote his show, &quot;Wipeout&quot;. Aisha Tyler has also appeared on &quot;The Soup&quot;, claiming she wanted to &quot;see the old studios.&quot;

&quot;The Soup&quot; has been mistakenly referred to as &quot;Talk Soup&quot; by Jean Bice, Mickey Rourke, Beth Koller and many others in the media.

<text>Amused to Death is the third studio album by English musician Roger Waters, released 7 September 1992 on Columbia. Produced by Waters and Patrick Leonard, it was mixed in QSound to enhance its spatial feel. The album features Jeff Beck on lead guitar on several tracks. The album&#x27;s title was inspired by Neil Postman&#x27;s 1985 book &quot;Amusing Ourselves to Death.&quot;

In 2015, the album was remastered and re-released with new artwork and in different formats, including a new 5.1 surround sound mix by original engineer James Guthrie, assisted by Joel Plante.

==Background and production==
Roger Waters started working on &quot;Amused to Death&quot; in 1987 when he first wrote &quot;Perfect Sense.&quot; It was several years before the album was released.

&quot;Amused to Death&quot; was produced by Patrick Leonard, Waters, and was co-produced with Nick Griffiths in London at The Billiard Room, Olympic Studios, CTS Studios, Angel Recording Studios and Abbey Road Studios. The album was engineered by Hayden Bendall, Jerry Jordan, and Stephen McLaughlan and mixed by James Guthrie. The album is mixed in QSound to enhance the spatial feel of the audio, and the many sound effects on the album – rifle range ambience, sleigh-bells, cars, planes, distant horses, chirping crickets, and dogs – all make use of the 3-D facility.

Amused to Death is the only studio album by Waters to not have a tour supporting it, though some songs were performed during the In The Flesh and Us + Them tours, and &quot;The Bravery of Being Out of Range&quot; was performed on the This Is Not A Drill tour.

==Themes==

The album is loosely organized around the idea of an ape randomly switching channels on a television, but explores numerous political and social themes, including critiques of the First Gulf War in &quot;The Bravery of Being Out of Range&quot; and &quot;Perfect Sense&quot;.

The first track, &quot;The Ballad of Bill Hubbard&quot;, features the voice of World War I veteran . A member of the Royal Fusiliers, he describes finding fellow soldier William &quot;Bill&quot; Hubbard – to whom the album is dedicated – severely wounded on the battlefield. After failed attempts to take him to safety, Razzell is forced to abandon him in no man&#x27;s land. The tale is continued at the end of the title track, at the very end of the album, providing a coda to the tragic story, with Razzell describing how he finally found peace. The excerpts are from BBC Television&#x27;s 1991 &quot;Everyman&quot; documentary, &quot;A Game of Ghosts&quot;, marking the 75th anniversary of the start of the Battle of the Somme. &quot;I found it very moving,&quot; Waters remarked. &quot;That original programme confronted the horrors of war and told the real story. It was an example of television taking its responsibilities seriously.&quot; The opening track also features the sound of several animals.

The second song, &quot;What God Wants, Part I&quot;, follows and contrasts the moving words of Razzell by opening with the TV being tuned instead into an excerpt of a child who says, &quot;I don&#x27;t mind about the war. That&#x27;s one of the things I like to watch – if it&#x27;s a war going on. &#x27;Cos then I know if, um, our side&#x27;s winning, if our side&#x27;s losing...&quot; he is then interrupted by the channel being changed and a burst of ape-chatter.

&quot;Perfect Sense&quot; is a two-part song about a world where live transmissions of wars are the main form of entertainment. The first part begins with a loud, unintelligible rant, then a backwards message from Waters: &quot;Julia, however, in the light and visions of the issues of Stanley, we changed our minds. We have decided to include a backward message. Stanley, for you, and for all the other book burners.&quot; The message climaxes with Waters yelling in the aggressive Scottish voice he used to depict the teacher in &quot;The Wall&quot;. In the second part, sportscaster Marv Albert narrates a war as if it were a basketball game. &quot;My main inspiration behind the song &#x27;Perfect Sense&#x27;,&quot; Waters explained, &quot;came from thinking about the days of the Roman Empire, when they would flood the Colosseum and have fights between rival galleys. I&#x27;ve always been intrigued by this notion of war as an entertainment to mollify the folks back home, and the Gulf conflict fuelled that idea.&quot; 
&quot;The Bravery of Being Out of Range&quot; includes a reference to a song written by Waters on Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;Animals&quot;, &quot;Sheep&quot;, and to &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot;. In &quot;Sheep&quot; Waters sings, &quot;I&#x27;ve looked over Jordan and I have seen, things are not what they seem&quot;; in &quot;The Bravery of Being Out of Range&quot; he sings &quot;I looked over Jordan and what did I see? I saw a U.S. Marine in a pile of debris.&quot;

&quot;Late Home Tonight, Part I&quot;, which opens with the song of a Eurasian skylark, recalls the 1986 US air strike against Libya from the perspective of two &quot;ordinary wives&quot; and a young American F-111 pilot. The lyrics about &quot;when you take the jeans from the refrigerator&quot; reference a 1985 Levi&#x27;s 501 commercial.

At the beginning of &quot;What God Wants, Part II&quot; Charles Fleischer (better known as the voice of Roger Rabbit) performs the greedy teleevangelist&#x27;s sermon. The lyrics about God wanting silver, gold and &quot;his secret never to be told&quot; reference the nursery rhyme, &quot;One for Sorrow&quot;. &quot;What God Wants, Part III&quot; musically references the Pink Floyd songs &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Part I)&quot;, &quot;Echoes&quot; and &quot;Breathe (In the Air)&quot;. It ends with an audio clip of Tom Bromley, an elderly WWI veteran, singing &quot;Wait &#x27;Till the Sun Shines, Nellie&quot; &quot;a capella&quot;. The clip is also from &quot;A Game of Ghosts&quot;.

&quot;Too Much Rope&quot; includes the line, &quot;Each man has his price, Bob, and yours was pretty low.&quot; &quot;I would sometimes rehearse vocal takes by impersonating Bob Dylan,&quot; Waters explained. &quot;That line originally read, &#x27;Each man has his price, my friends…&#x27; – so make of that what you will. As a joke, I sang &#x27;Bob&#x27; instead, and Pat &quot;(Leonard, producer)&quot; insisted that we leave it in. So, although it was unintentional, I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s there for &quot;(Pink Floyd producer)&quot; Bob Ezrin. I hope he appreciates it.&quot;

The song &quot;Watching TV&quot; (a duet with Don Henley) explores the influence of mass media on the Chinese protests for democracy in Tiananmen Square.

In &quot;It&#x27;s a Miracle&quot; Waters makes a scathing reference to Andrew Lloyd Webber (whom he would accuse elsewhere of having plagiarised music from Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Echoes&quot; for sections of the musical &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;): The same song features a sample from the 1977 low-budget zombie film &quot;Shock Waves&quot; in which the film&#x27;s characters wrestle over a flashlight. The title track begins with the lyric, &quot;Doctor, Doctor&quot;. &quot;Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk&quot; on &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;, the first song written by Waters, opens with the same line.

===HAL samples===
Waters stated in a &quot;Rockline&quot; interview on February 8, 1993, that he had wanted to use dialogue samples from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; on the album, specifically HAL 9000&#x27;s &#x27;dying&#x27; monologue. Stanley Kubrick, the film&#x27;s director, turned him down on the basis that it would open the door to many other people using the sound sample. Others think that Kubrick refused because Pink Floyd had not allowed him to use music from &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; in his film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. Waters did use the samples of HAL describing his mind being taken away when performing live – specifically at the beginning of &quot;Perfect Sense, Part I&quot; during his In the Flesh tour, after Kubrick&#x27;s death, and it was finally incorporated into the &quot;Amused to Death&quot; album for the 2015 remaster / remix release.

== Title ==
The album&#x27;s title was inspired by Neil Postman&#x27;s book &quot;Amusing Ourselves to Death.&quot; In Postman&#x27;s later book &quot;The End of Education&quot;, he remarks on the album:

==Packaging==
The album&#x27;s original artwork features a chimpanzee watching television in reference to Kubrick&#x27;s film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. The image on the TV is a gigantic eyeball staring at the viewer. According to Waters, the ape was &quot;a symbol for anyone who&#x27;s been sitting with his mouth open in front of the network and cable news for the last 10 years.&quot;

==Reception==

AllMusic described the album as &quot;a masterpiece in the sense that it brings together all of his obsessions in one grand, but not unwieldy, package&quot;. &quot;Record Collector&quot; wrote that the album shows Waters &quot;at his most bleakly inspired since the cautionary parable of &quot;The Wall&quot;&quot;. However, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was less favorable, writing &quot;The result is blurred structure (partly improved by the moving old-soldier&#x27;s tale Waters uses as a framing device), too much repetition and a certain distance and overintellectualization. [...] overall there&#x27;s a dearth of the good old pop-rock appeal that always lifted the better Pink Floyd records.&quot; A negative review came from &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, writing &quot;self-importance doesn&#x27;t equal profundity, and the world&#x27;s most mind-blowing engineering couldn&#x27;t cover up the deterioration of Waters&#x27; singing and melodic sense since his days with Floyd.&quot; &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; included &quot;Amused to Death&quot; on their list &quot;Top 100 90&#x27;s Rock Albums&quot;.

==Legacy==
Waters told &quot;Classic Rock&quot;: &quot;My view is that I&#x27;ve been involved in two absolutely classic albums – &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and &quot;The Wall&quot; [...] And if you haven&#x27;t got &quot;Amused to Death&quot;, you haven&#x27;t got the full set. So this album – the live one, which pulls together songs from all three albums – hopefully redresses the balance.&quot; On 19 September 2013, Waters told BBC HardTalk that &quot;Amused to Death&quot; has been completely underrated.

On 15 April 2015, Waters announced that the album would be remastered and reissued on 24 July 2015 featuring a new 5.1 multichannel audio mix, as well as a new stereo mix. It was made available in a number of formats, including CD, SACD, Blu-ray and high-resolution downloads. In a review of the 2015 remastering of the album, journalist J.C. Maçek III of Spectrum Culture wrote that &quot;Not every album can be a masterpiece, but Waters has stated that &quot;Amused to Death&quot; is an underrated effort that serves as a third part to &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and &quot;The Wall&quot;. But it&#x27;s nowhere near those other albums. The 2015 remastering makes it a good sounding album, but it&#x27;s just not the kind of infinitely listenable album that Waters is capable of creating.&quot; In its review of the 2015 reissue, PopMatters wrote: &quot;not only has &quot;Amused to Death&quot; aged well musically, it has unfortunately aged well thematically too. [...] &quot;Amused to Death&quot; was and still is a powerful statement from one of rock music&#x27;s most literate misanthropes. As time goes on, it gets harder and harder to believe that it slipped under everyone&#x27;s radar so thoroughly.&quot; Drowned in Sound wrote: &quot;&quot;Amused to Death&quot; stands up on its own as one of the better, more intriguing post-Floyd records&quot;.

In 2016 &quot;Amused to Death&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Surround Sound Album at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards. The winners were listed as follows:
&quot;James Guthrie, surround mix engineer; James Guthrie &amp; Joel Plante, surround mastering engineers; James Guthrie, surround producer (Roger Waters) 
Label: Columbia/Legacy&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Amused to Death&quot; reached No. 8 on the UK Albums Chart, Waters&#x27; first Top 10 as a solo artist in his homeland, and a career high of No. 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, aided by &quot;What God Wants, Part I&quot;, which hit No. 4 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in 1992. It was also certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry for sales of over 60,000 in the UK.

<doc id="426303" wikidata="Q2166850" url="?curid=426303" title="Triple Frontier">
<text>The Triple Frontier (, ) is a tri-border area along the junction of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, where the Iguazú and Paraná rivers converge. Near the confluence are the cities of Puerto Iguazú (Argentina), Foz do Iguaçu (Brazil) and Ciudad del Este (Paraguay). This area is near Iguazú Falls and the Itaipu hydroelectric plant.

==Population==
The population in the Triple Frontier is concentrated in three border cities, with the majority of the region&#x27;s population living on the Paraguayan side of the border. Of the three major border cities, the largest is Ciudad del Este in Paraguay, which in 2018 had a population of 299,255. Meanwhile, the tourist-centric Brazilian city Foz do Iguaçu has a population of approximately 258,248 (2020) and Puerto Iguazú, Argentina is the smallest of the three cities, with a population of just 82,227. 

In the metropolitan region of the Paraguayan side, Presidente Franco has a population in 2018 of 98,805; Hernandarias, 79,036; and Minga Guazú, 86,755. 

All together, the population of the Triple Frontier adds up to about 950,000 people, making this region the tripoint with the highest population in the world. 

The Arab community and other Asian immigrant communities, which make up an important part of the urban population in the Triple Frontier, are estimated to number approximately 30,000.
==Tourism==
The Triple Frontier is an important tourist area, within the touristic subregion of the Región de las Aguas Grandes. Visitors can see the Tancredo Neves bridge, which connects the Argentine city of Puerto Iguazú and its Brazilian neighbor, Foz do Iguaçu. At the convergence of the borders, each of the three bordering countries has erected an obelisk, painted in the national colors of the country in which it is located. All three countries can be seen from each of the obelisks.


The Guarani Aquifer is arguably the biggest reservoir of fresh, potable water in the world—right under Triple Border soil (Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay). The majority (71%) of its 1.2 million square kilometers lies in Brazil. 
==Security==
The George W. Bush administration cited &quot;clear examples&quot; of Islamic groups in the tri-border region in 2002 that &quot;finance terrorist activities.&quot; Hezbollah and Hamas were believed at the time to operate in the Triple Frontier.

The particular geography of the border region, rampant political corruption and weak judicial system make it very difficult to monitor organized crime and the illicit activities connected with it. To U.S. officials and law enforcement familiar with the region, &quot;Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia have been fostering a well-financed force of Islamist radicals in the region&quot;.

A counter-terrorism expert with the Pentagon&#x27;s National Security Study Group described the Tri-border in 2007 as &quot;the most important base for Hezbollah outside Lebanon itself, home to a community of dangerous fanatics that send their money to financially support Hezbollah.&quot; Of the 25,000 Lebanese Arabs who live in the region, not all support terrorism, but many openly acknowledge they send money to Hezbollah and that Shiite mosques have &quot;an obligation to finance it&quot;.

The Paraguayan authorities say they have evidence that money is being sent to organizations with terrorist connections because of the amount of money leaving Paraguay for the Middle East, said Carlos Altemburger, Chief of the Department for the Prevention and Investigation of Terrorism in Paraguay. In response to the situation, Paraguay approved the entry of 400 US soldiers &quot;for joint military exercises, such as programs on fighting urban terrorists, public security and humanitarian assistance&quot;, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. However, in October 2006 Paraguay decided not to renew a defense-cooperation agreement.

Foz do Iguaçu tourist groups dispute the reports of terrorist activity in the region, as has the U.S. State Department.

Since 1996, the Tripartite Command of the Triple Frontier, which coordinates monitoring tasks among the three bordering countries, has been operating from Foz do Iguaçu. The 3+1 Group was created between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and the United States (the &quot;1&quot;), in 2002 to further strengthen security in the region. In 2005, the governments of the three nations stated they would set up a joint intelligence center in Foz do Iguaçu specifically to monitor the situation.

<doc id="426305" wikidata="Q874437" url="?curid=426305" title="Group selection">
<text>Group selection is a proposed mechanism of evolution in which natural selection acts at the level of the group, instead of at the level of the individual or gene.

Early authors such as V. C. Wynne-Edwards and Konrad Lorenz argued that the behavior of animals could affect their survival and reproduction as groups, speaking for instance of actions for the good of the species. In the 1930s, R.A. Fisher and J.B.S. Haldane proposed the concept of kin selection, a form of altruism from the gene-centered view of evolution, arguing that animals should sacrifice for their relatives, and thereby implying that they should not sacrifice for non-relatives. From the mid-1960s, evolutionary biologists such as John Maynard Smith, W. D. Hamilton, George C. Williams, and Richard Dawkins argued that natural selection acted primarily at the level of the gene. They argued on the basis of mathematical models that individuals would not altruistically sacrifice fitness for the sake of a group unless it would ultimately increase the likelihood of an individual passing on their genes. A consensus emerged that group selection did not occur, including in special situations such as the haplodiploid social insects like honeybees (in the Hymenoptera), where kin selection explains the behaviour of non-reproductives equally well, since the only way for them to reproduce their genes is via kin.

In 1994 David Sloan Wilson and Elliott Sober argued for multi-level selection, including group selection, on the grounds that groups, like individuals, could compete. In 2010 three authors including E. O. Wilson, known for his work on social insects especially ants, again revisited the arguments for group selection. They argued that group selection can occur when competition between two or more groups, some containing altruistic individuals who act cooperatively together, is more important for survival than competition between individuals within each group. A large group of ethologists conceded that while inclusive fitness may be debatable, it was still a useful theory in practice.

==Early developments==
Charles Darwin developed the theory of evolution in his book, &quot;Origin of Species&quot;. Darwin also made the first suggestion of group selection in &quot;The Descent of Man&quot; that the evolution of groups could affect the survival of individuals. He wrote, &quot;If one man in a tribe... invented a new snare or weapon, the tribe would increase in number, spread, and supplant other tribes. In a tribe thus rendered more numerous there would always be a rather better chance of the birth of other superior and inventive members.&quot;

Once Darwinism had been accepted in the modern synthesis of the mid-twentieth century, animal behavior was glibly explained with unsubstantiated hypotheses about survival value, which was largely taken for granted. The naturalist Konrad Lorenz had argued loosely in books like &quot;On Aggression&quot; (1966) that animal behavior patterns were &quot;for the good of the species&quot;, without actually studying survival value in the field. Richard Dawkins noted that Lorenz was a good of the species&#x27; man&quot; so accustomed to group selection thinking that he did not realize his views &quot;contravened orthodox Darwinian theory&quot;. The ethologist Niko Tinbergen praised Lorenz for his interest in the survival value of behavior, and naturalists enjoyed Lorenz&#x27;s writings for the same reason. In 1962, group selection was used as a popular explanation for adaptation by the zoologist V. C. Wynne-Edwards. In 1976, Richard Dawkins wrote a well-known book on the importance of evolution at the level of the gene or the individual, &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;.

From the mid-1960s, evolutionary biologists argued that natural selection acted primarily at the level of the individual. In 1964, John Maynard Smith, C. M. Perrins (1964), and George C. Williams in his 1966 book &quot;Adaptation and Natural Selection&quot; cast serious doubt on group selection as a major mechanism of evolution; Williams&#x27;s 1971 book &quot;Group Selection&quot; assembled writings from many authors on the same theme.

It was at that time generally agreed that this was the case even for eusocial insects such as honeybees, which encourages kin selection, since workers are closely related.

==Kin selection and inclusive fitness theory==
Experiments from the late 1970s suggested that selection involving groups was possible. Early group selection models assumed that genes acted independently, for example a gene that coded for cooperation or altruism. Genetically based reproduction of individuals implies that, in group formation, the altruistic genes would need a way to act for the benefit of members in the group to enhance the fitness of many individuals with the same gene. But it is expected from this model that individuals of the same species would compete against each other for the same resources. This would put cooperating individuals at a disadvantage, making genes for cooperation likely to be eliminated. Group selection on the level of the species is flawed because it is difficult to see how selective pressures would be applied to competing/non-cooperating individuals.

Kin selection between related individuals is accepted as an explanation of altruistic behavior. R.A. Fisher in 1930 and J.B.S. Haldane in 1932 set out the mathematics of kin selection, with Haldane famously joking that he would willingly die for two brothers or eight cousins. In this model, genetically related individuals cooperate because survival advantages to one individual also benefit kin who share some fraction of the same genes, giving a mechanism for favoring genetic selection.

Inclusive fitness theory, first proposed by W. D. Hamilton in the early 1960s, gives a selection criterion for evolution of social traits when social behavior is costly to an individual organism&#x27;s survival and reproduction. The criterion is that the reproductive benefit to relatives who carry the social trait, multiplied by their relatedness (the probability that they share the altruistic trait) exceeds the cost to the individual. Inclusive fitness theory is a general treatment of the statistical probabilities of social traits accruing to any other organisms likely to propagate a copy of the same social trait. Kin selection theory treats the narrower but simpler case of the benefits to close genetic relatives (or what biologists call &#x27;kin&#x27;) who may also carry and propagate the trait. A significant group of biologists support inclusive fitness as the explanation for social behavior in a wide range of species, as supported by experimental data. An article was published in &quot;Nature&quot; with over a hundred coauthors.

One of the questions about kin selection is the requirement that individuals must know if other individuals are related to them, or kin recognition. Any altruistic act has to preserve similar genes. One argument given by Hamilton is that many individuals operate in &quot;viscous&quot; conditions, so that they live in physical proximity to relatives. Under these conditions, they can act altruistically to any other individual, and it is likely that the other individual will be related. This population structure builds a continuum between individual selection, kin selection, kin group selection and group selection without a clear boundary for each level. However, early theoretical models by D.S. Wilson et al. and Taylor showed that pure population viscosity cannot lead to cooperation and altruism. This is because any benefit generated by kin cooperation is exactly cancelled out by kin competition; additional offspring from cooperation are eliminated by local competition. Mitteldorf and D. S. Wilson later showed that if the population is allowed to fluctuate, then local populations can temporarily store the benefit of local cooperation and promote the evolution of cooperation and altruism. By assuming individual differences in adaptations, Yang further showed that the benefit of local altruism can be stored in the form of offspring quality and thus promote the evolution of altruism even if the population does not fluctuate. This is because local competition among more individuals resulting from local altruism increases the average local fitness of the individuals that survive.

Another explanation for the recognition of genes for altruism is that a single trait, group reciprocal kindness, is capable of explaining the vast majority of altruism that is generally accepted as &quot;good&quot; by modern societies. The phenotype of altruism relies on recognition of the altruistic behavior by itself. The trait of kindness will be recognized by sufficiently intelligent and undeceived organisms in other individuals with the same trait. Moreover, the existence of such a trait predicts a tendency for kindness to unrelated organisms that are apparently kind, even if the organisms are of another species. The gene need not be exactly the same, so long as the effect or phenotype is similar. Multiple versions of the gene—or even meme—would have virtually the same effect. This explanation was given by Richard Dawkins as an analogy of a man with a green beard. Green-bearded men are imagined as tending to cooperate with each other simply by seeing a green beard, where the green beard trait is incidentally linked to the reciprocal kindness trait.

==Multilevel selection theory==
Kin selection or inclusive fitness is accepted as an explanation for cooperative behavior in many species, but the scientist David Sloan Wilson argues that human behavior is difficult to explain with only this approach. In particular, he claims it does not seem to explain the rapid rise of human civilization. Wilson has argued that other factors must also be considered in evolution. Wilson and others have continued to develop group selection models.

Early group selection models were flawed because they assumed that genes acted independently; but genetically based interactions among individuals are ubiquitous in group formation because genes must cooperate for the benefit of association in groups to enhance the fitness of group members. Additionally, group selection on the level of the species is flawed because it is difficult to see how selective pressures would be applied; selection in social species of groups against other groups, rather than the species entire, seems to be the level at which selective pressures are plausible. On the other hand, kin selection is accepted as an explanation of altruistic behavior. Some biologists argue that kin selection and multilevel selection are both needed to &quot;obtain a complete understanding of the evolution of a social behavior system&quot;.

In 1994, David Sloan Wilson and Elliott Sober argued that the case against group selection had been overstated. They considered whether groups can have functional organization in the same way as individuals, and consequently whether groups can be &quot;vehicles&quot; for selection. They do not posit evolution on the level of the species, but selective pressures that winnow out small groups within a species, e.g. groups of social insects or primates. Groups that cooperate better might survive and reproduce more than those that did not. Resurrected in this way, Wilson &amp; Sober&#x27;s new group selection is called multilevel selection theory.

In 2010, Martin Nowak, C. E. Tarnita and E. O. Wilson argued for multi-level selection, including group selection, to correct what they saw as deficits in the explanatory power of inclusive fitness. A response from 137 other evolutionary biologists argued &quot;that their arguments are based upon a misunderstanding of evolutionary theory and a misrepresentation of the empirical literature&quot;.

Wilson compared the layers of competition and evolution to nested sets of Russian matryoshka dolls. The lowest level is the genes, next come the cells, then the organism level and finally the groups. The different levels function cohesively to maximize fitness, or reproductive success. The theory asserts that selection for the group level, involving competition between groups, must outweigh the individual level, involving individuals competing within a group, for a group-benefiting trait to spread.

Multilevel selection theory focuses on the phenotype because it looks at the levels that selection directly acts upon. For humans, social norms can be argued to reduce individual level variation and competition, thus shifting selection to the group level. The assumption is that variation between different groups is larger than variation within groups. Competition and selection can operate at all levels regardless of scale. Wilson wrote, &quot;At all scales, there must be mechanisms that coordinate the right kinds of action and prevent disruptive forms of self-serving behavior at lower levels of social organization.&quot; E. O. Wilson summarized, &quot;In a group, selfish individuals beat altruistic individuals. But, groups of altruistic individuals beat groups of selfish individuals.&quot;

Wilson ties the multilevel selection theory regarding humans to another theory, gene–culture coevolution, by acknowledging that culture seems to characterize a group-level mechanism for human groups to adapt to environmental changes.

MLS theory can be used to evaluate the balance between group selection and individual selection in specific cases. An experiment by William Muir compared egg productivity in hens, showing that a hyper-aggressive strain had been produced through individual selection, leading to many fatal attacks after only six generations; by implication, it could be argued that group selection must have been acting to prevent this in real life. Group selection has most often been postulated in humans and, notably, eusocial Hymenoptera that make cooperation a driving force of their adaptations over time and have a unique system of inheritance involving haplodiploidy that allows the colony to function as an individual while only the queen reproduces.

Wilson and Sober&#x27;s work revived interest in multilevel selection. In a 2005 article, E. O. Wilson argued that kin selection could no longer be thought of as underlying the evolution of extreme sociality, for two reasons. First, he suggested, the argument that haplodiploid inheritance (as in the Hymenoptera) creates a strong selection pressure towards nonreproductive castes is mathematically flawed. Second, eusociality no longer seems to be confined to the hymenopterans; increasing numbers of highly social taxa have been found in the years since Wilson&#x27;s foundational text &quot;&quot; was published in 1975. These including a variety of insect species, as well as two rodent species (the naked mole-rat and the Damaraland mole rat). Wilson suggests the equation for Hamilton&#x27;s rule:

:::rb &gt; c

(where b represents the benefit to the recipient of altruism, c the cost to the altruist, and r their degree of relatedness) should be replaced by the more general equation

:::rbk + be &gt; c

in which bk is the benefit to kin (b in the original equation) and be is the benefit accruing to the group as a whole. He then argues that, in the present state of the evidence in relation to social insects, it appears that be&gt;rbk, so that altruism needs to be explained in terms of selection at the colony level rather than at the kin level. However, kin selection and group selection are not distinct processes, and the effects of multi-level selection are already accounted for in Hamilton&#x27;s rule, &quot;rb&quot;&gt;&quot;c&quot;, provided that an expanded definition of &quot;r&quot;, not requiring Hamilton&#x27;s original assumption of direct genealogical relatedness, is used, as proposed by E. O. Wilson himself.

Spatial populations of predators and prey show restraint of reproduction at equilibrium, both individually and through social communication, as originally proposed by Wynne-Edwards. While these spatial populations do not have well-defined groups for group selection, the local spatial interactions of organisms in transient groups are sufficient to lead to a kind of multi-level selection. There is however as yet no evidence that these processes operate in the situations where Wynne-Edwards posited them.

Rauch et al.&#x27;s analysis of host-parasite evolution is broadly hostile to group selection. Specifically, the parasites do not individually moderate their transmission; rather, more transmissible variants – which have a short-term but unsustainable advantage – arise, increase, and go extinct.

==Applications==

=== Differing evolutionarily stable strategies ===
The problem with group selection is that for a whole group to get a single trait, it must spread through the whole group first by regular evolution. But, as J. L. Mackie suggested, when there are many different groups, each with a different evolutionarily stable strategy, there is selection between the different strategies, since some are worse than others. For example, a group where altruism was universal would indeed outcompete a group where every creature acted in its own interest, so group selection might seem feasible; but a mixed group of altruists and non-altruists would be vulnerable to cheating by non-altruists within the group, so group selection would collapse.

===Implications in population biology===

Social behaviors such as altruism and group relationships can impact many aspects of population dynamics, such as intraspecific competition and interspecific interactions. In 1871, Darwin argued that group selection occurs when the benefits of cooperation or altruism between subpopulations are greater than the individual benefits of egotism within a subpopulation. This supports the idea of multilevel selection, but kinship also plays an integral role because many subpopulations are composed of closely related individuals. An example of this can be found in lions, which are simultaneously cooperative and territorial. Within a pride, males protect the pride from outside males, and females, who are commonly sisters, communally raise cubs and hunt. However, this cooperation seems to be density dependent. When resources are limited, group selection favors prides that work together to hunt. When prey is abundant, cooperation is no longer beneficial enough to outweigh the disadvantages of altruism, and hunting is no longer cooperative.

Interactions between different species can also be affected by multilevel selection. Predator-prey relationships can also be affected. Individuals of certain monkey species howl to warn the group of the approach of a predator. The evolution of this trait benefits the group by providing protection, but could be disadvantageous to the individual if the howling draws the predator&#x27;s attention to them. By affecting these interspecific interactions, multilevel and kinship selection can change the population dynamics of an ecosystem.

Multilevel selection attempts to explain the evolution of altruistic behavior in terms of quantitative genetics. Increased frequency or fixation of altruistic alleles can be accomplished through kin selection, in which individuals engage in altruistic behavior to promote the fitness of genetically similar individuals such as siblings. However, this can lead to inbreeding depression, which typically lowers the overall fitness of a population. However, if altruism were to be selected for through an emphasis on benefit to the group as opposed to relatedness and benefit to kin, both the altruistic trait and genetic diversity could be preserved. However, relatedness should still remain a key consideration in studies of multilevel selection. Experimentally imposed multilevel selection on Japanese quail was more effective by an order of magnitude on closely related kin groups than on randomized groups of individuals.

===Gene-culture coevolution in humans===

Gene-culture coevolution (also called dual inheritance theory) is a modern hypothesis (applicable mostly to humans) that combines evolutionary biology and modern sociobiology to indicate group selection. It is believed that this approach of combining genetic influence with cultural influence over several generations is not present in the other hypotheses such as reciprocal altruism and kin selection, making gene-culture evolution one of the strongest realistic hypotheses for group selection. Fehr provides evidence of group selection taking place in humans presently with experimentation through logic games such as prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, the type of thinking that humans have developed many generations ago.

Gene-culture coevolution allows humans to develop highly distinct adaptations to the local pressures and environments more quickly than with genetic evolution alone. Robert Boyd and Peter J. Richerson, two strong proponents of cultural evolution, postulate that the act of social learning, or learning in a group as done in group selection, allows human populations to accrue information over many generations. This leads to cultural evolution of behaviors and technology alongside genetic evolution. Boyd and Richerson believe that the ability to collaborate evolved during the Middle Pleistocene, a million years ago, in response to a rapidly changing climate.

In 2003, the behavioral scientist Herbert Gintis examined cultural evolution statistically, offering evidence that societies that promote pro-social norms have higher survival rates than societies that do not. Gintis wrote that genetic and cultural evolution can work together. Genes transfer information in DNA, and cultures transfer information encoded in brains, artifacts, or documents. Language, tools, lethal weapons, fire, cooking, etc., have a long-term effect on genetics. For example, cooking led to a reduction of size of the human gut, since less digestion is needed for cooked food. Language led to a change in the human larynx and an increase in brain size. Projectile weapons led to changes in human hands and shoulders, such that humans are much better at throwing objects than the closest human relative, the chimpanzee.

In 2015, William Yaworsky and colleagues surveyed the opinions of anthropologists on group selection, finding that these varied with the gender and politics of the social scientists concerned.
In 2019, Howard Rachlin and colleagues proposed group selection of behavioural patterns, such as learned altruism, during ontogeny parallel to group selection during phylogeny.

==Criticism==

The vast majority of behavioural biologists have not been convinced by renewed attempts to revisit group selection as a plausible mechanism of evolution.

The use of the Price equation to support group selection was challenged by van Veelen in 2012, arguing that it is based on invalid mathematical assumptions.

Advocates of the gene-centered view of evolution such as Dawkins and Daniel Dennett remain unconvinced about group selection. Dawkins suggests that group selection fails to make an appropriate distinction between replicators and vehicles. The evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne summarizes the arguments in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; in non-technical terms as follows:

The psychologist Steven Pinker states that &quot;group selection has no useful role to play in psychology or social science&quot;, since in these domains it &quot;is not a precise implementation of the theory of natural selection, as it is, say, in genetic algorithms or artificial life simulations. Instead [in psychology] it is a loose metaphor, more like the struggle among kinds of tires or telephones.&quot;

It is part of the northern fringe of the Nellis Range, measuring . Tonopah Test Range is located about northwest of Groom Lake, the home of the Area 51 facility.

Like the Groom Lake facility, Tonopah is a site of interest to conspiracy theorists, mostly for its use of experimental and classified aircraft. As such, it is not generally the focus of alien enthusiasts, unlike its neighbor. It is currently used for nuclear weapons stockpile reliability testing, research and development of fusing and firing systems, and testing nuclear weapon delivery systems. The airspace comprises restricted area R-4809 of the Nevada Test and Training Range and is often used for military training.

==Description==
The Tonopah Test Range is owned by the United States Department of Energy and is managed by Sandia National Laboratories, a division of Honeywell International, which operates the Tonopah Test Range under an Air Force permit with the National Nuclear Security Administration. The range is part of the Great Basin Desert and lies mostly within the Cactus Flat valley, consisting of horst and graben geology. It is flanked by the Cactus Peak hills to the west and the Kawich Peak to the east, which is home of Silverbow, one of the largest mining ghost towns in Nevada. The vegetation consists mostly of black sagebrush and creosote bush. It holds a sizable wild horse and burro population, closely monitored by the Bureau of Land Management. Common denizens of the TTR include the gray fox, pronghorn, coyote, and mule deer, along with the native birds sage thrasher, sage grouse, and sage sparrow.

===Airfields===
One of the primary facilities on the TTR is a large airfield (Area 10), consisting of a runway and numerous hangars. About five minor abandoned airfields exist throughout the TTR which were primarily used during World War II by units based at Tonopah Army Air Field (now serving as Tonopah&#x27;s municipal airport). Only Mellan Airstrip, southeast of Tonopah Test Range Airport, survived past the 1960s, upgraded to a concrete runway. A US Air Force assessment published in 2000 indicated it was a minimally adequate airfield which was used to support tactical C-130 and C-17 training.

===Mancamp===
About six miles (10 km) north of the airfield is a large housing area called Mancamp. It contains about 50 twin-level dormitories. A recreation center, houses, a bar, a library, game room, weight room, Olympic size indoor pool, racquetball courts, a two-lane bowling alley, a barbecue pad, and an ATM. There is also an athletic track, tennis courts, and softball fields. Just outside Mancamp a small civilian compound existed, but was mostly dismantled by 2000. Google Earth imagery indicated that Mancamp&#x27;s streets were renovated sometime between 2003 and 2007.

===Sandia National Laboratories===
Operations by Sandia are controlled at the TTR Operations Control Center (Area 3), just southeast of the main airfield, which houses the range safety officer, test director, and key engineers. Activities are monitored with video, high-speed cameras, and radar tracking devices. Though nuclear weapons have never been detonated on the TTR, the 1963 test Project Rollercoaster involved the destruction of four weapons, which caused some plutonium to be dispersed into the soil north of Antelope Lake.

==History==

In the early 20th century, the region was used primarily for mining and some grazing. Early maps from the 1930s indicated a roadway connecting the towns of Caliente and Tonopah via Rachel, which ascended Cedar Pass and crossed through the northern part of the future Tonopah Test Range. In 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt directed the establishment of a US Army Air Corps training range in this area. During the 1950s, weapons design research had been conducted largely at the Salton Sea testing base, but haze problems forced the Department of Energy to seek another location. The Tonopah Test Range was withdrawn from public use in 1956, and testing began in 1957 for United States Department of Energy weapons programs. For most of its life, the range was administered by Sandia National Laboratories. In 2008, the National Nuclear Security Administration proposed to move its facilities on the Tonopah Test Range to White Sands Missile Range, a move that local and state politicians say would cost the area jobs and lost revenue.

===Constant Peg===
From 1979 to 1988, Tonopah hosted a MiG air combat training program code named Constant Peg. The brainchild of Colonel Gail Peck, the program was run by the 4477th Test &amp; Evaluation Squadron, &quot;Red Eagles&quot;, and allowed American aircrews the opportunity to fly – and to fly against – the fighter aircraft of their Cold War rivals. Constant Peg was formally declassified on November 15, 2006, though it had been discussed by name in various media since the mid-1980s. At the height of the operation, the Red Eagles flew 14 Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21s and 9 Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23s (with additional airframes of both types available for cannibalization), and had also operated the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 until 1982, when the type proved too dangerous to continue flying. Between July 1979 and its final sortie in March 1988, 5,930 aircrew were exposed to Constant Peg.

===Stealth===

F-117s of the 4450th Tactical Group operated from Tonopah in secret from 1982 through 1989 while the program was still classified. During this period Mancamp was connected to the airfield by shuttle bus service, while the airfield in turn was connected to Nellis Air Force Base by between five and twenty Key Air Boeing 727 and/or Boeing 737 flights per day from Nellis to Tonopah. The airfield was also serviced by one or two Janet Boeing 737 flights daily, which were presumably from McCarran International Airport and served Sandia National Laboratories employees. In early 1991, Key Air lost the contract and the service was taken over by American Trans Air Boeing 727 aircraft. Key Air departed directly from Nellis, AFB, and did not utilize McCarren International, as it was too far a distance from the base, and impractical.

===Contamination===
It was revealed in 2007 that during the 1980s a contractor had dumped up to 1,000 pounds of urea at a pond on the TTR, resulting in the die-off of 61 horses in 1988. The fluid had been used as a de-icing agent. The Bureau of Land Management investigated in November 1988, and imposed remedial actions and assessed a $15,000 fine. In 2007 over concerns that the chemical was infiltrating groundwater, a whistleblower unsuccessfully attempted to get the Environmental Protection Agency to intervene, leading to an August 2007 inquiry with the Department of the Interior by Senator Harry Reid.

===S-300PS SAM testing===
The TTR has also been the site of US testing of foreign-made surface-to-air missile systems. Satellite imagery confirms the US secretly acquiring the Russian made S-300PS surface-to-air missile system from an unknown supplier in order to test UAVs as well as other advanced aircraft based at nearby airbases. According to OSGEOINT, these bases include Creech Air Force Base, the Yucca Lake UAV testing facility, and Nellis Air Force Base, operating the MQ-9 Reaper, RQ-170, and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter in addition to other aircraft. The testing of aircraft is executed under the direction of the 53rd Wing Test and Evaluation Group based at Nellis.

<doc id="426311" wikidata="Q852753" url="?curid=426311" title="Queen's Park F.C.">
<text>Queen&#x27;s Park Football Club is a Scottish professional football club based in Glasgow, which plays in the Scottish Championship, the second tier of the Scottish football pyramid. Queen&#x27;s Park is the oldest association football club in Scotland, having been founded in 1867, and is the 10th oldest in the world.

The club was fully amateur for the first 152 years and has played in white and black hoops as shirt colours for the vast majority of its existence. 
For many years, the club was the only fully amateur club in the Scottish professional leagues, until its membership voted to end that status in November 2019. The club&#x27;s amateur status was reflected by its Latin motto, &#x27;Ludere Causa Ludendi&#x27; – &#x27;To Play for the Sake of Playing&#x27;.

Queen&#x27;s Park is also the only Scottish football club to have played in the English FA Cup Final, achieving this feat in both 1884 and 1885. With 10 titles, Queen&#x27;s Park has won the Scottish Cup the third most times of any club, behind only Celtic and Rangers, although their last such win was in 1893. Having also been the first winners, Queen&#x27;s were the record holders of the Scottish Cup for 51 years until Celtic claimed the trophy for the 11th time in 1925.

For over a century, the club&#x27;s home has been Hampden Park in south-east Glasgow, a Category 4 stadium which is also the home of the Scotland national team. The club alternate playing games there with playing at their previous reserve and training ground adjacent to the main stadium, Lesser Hampden, with plans to fully redevelop it into a 1,774-seat stadium.

== History ==
=== Beginnings (1867–68)===

The Queen&#x27;s Park Football Club was founded on 9 July 1867 with the words: &quot;Tonight at half past eight o&#x27;clock a number of gentlemen met at No. 3 Eglinton Terrace for the purpose of forming a football club.&quot;

Gentlemen from the local YMCA took part in football matches in the local Glasgow area which gave the club its name. During the inaugural meeting, debate raged over the club&#x27;s name. Proposals included: &#x27;The Celts&#x27;; &#x27;The Northern&#x27;, and &#x27;Morayshire&#x27;. Perhaps such choice of names suggest a Highland influence within the new club. After much deliberation, &#x27;Queen&#x27;s Park&#x27; was adopted and carried, but only by a majority of one vote. Although Queen&#x27;s was not the first club in Britain, that honour going to Edinburgh&#x27;s Foot-Ball Club, formed in 1824, they can certainly claim to be the first Association club in Scotland. Opposition first came in the form of a now defunct Glaswegian side called Thistle F.C. and Queen&#x27;s won 2–0 on 1 August 1868.

=== Early domination (1868–1900) ===

Within the context of the emerging Association game in Scotland, the historian and broadcaster Bob Crampsey compared the role of the Queen&#x27;s Park club with that of the Marylebone Cricket Club in cricket and The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in golf. The Glasgow club&#x27;s control of the early playing rules in Scotland, early management of the Scotland national team, and instigation of the Scottish Football Association and Scottish Challenge Cup provide evidence of its status as the &#x27;Premier&#x27; or &#x27;Senior&#x27; club of Scotland.

On 30 November 1872, Scotland faced England at the West of Scotland Cricket Club ground at Hamilton Crescent. For the one and only time all eleven Scots players were from Queen&#x27;s Park and they wore blue jerseys, as those were the current colours of Queen&#x27;s. 4,000 spectators watched Scotland play with a 2–2–6 formation and England with a 1–1–8 line-up.

Queen&#x27;s Park formed the Scottish Football Association on 13 March 1873, with eight other clubs. The match against Dumbreck on 25 October was the first match to be played at the first Hampden Park. It was also the first match which saw Queen&#x27;s Park players wear their custom black and white hooped jerseys, which lent the club the nickname of &#x27;The Spiders&#x27;. David Wotherspoon, a Queen&#x27;s Park player and committee member, has been credited with the introduction of the black and white hoops. Most importantly, it was the first Scottish Cup tie and Scottish competitive match for the club and Queen&#x27;s won 7–0. In the final, Queen&#x27;s defeated Clydesdale 2–0 at Hampden.

Success in the Scottish Cup followed in the next two years with final victories over Renton and Third Lanark. In drawing 2–2 with Clydesdale in the 1875 semi-final, Queen&#x27;s conceded their first ever goals. Defeat for the club was first experienced with a 2–1 defeat to Vale of Leven in the 5th round in December 1876. Third Lanark and Rangers eliminated the Spiders before Queen&#x27;s reclaimed the cup in 1880 with a win over Thornliebank. Dumbarton were beaten in the final in successive years. In 1881, Queen&#x27;s had to beat them twice after Dumbarton successfully appealed that the crowd at Kinning Park had encroached following a 2–1 defeat. Dumbarton got revenge in 1883 but Queen&#x27;s won again in 1884 without even having to play the final after Vale of Leven refused to play on the date stipulated by the SFA.

In the early days of England&#x27;s FA Cup, Scottish clubs were often invited to compete. As a result, Queen&#x27;s Park twice finished runners-up in this competition, in 1884, when they lost 2–1 to Blackburn Rovers and in 1885, when they lost 2–0, again to Blackburn Rovers. 1886–87 was the last time that they entered the FA Cup competition. This remained the only instance of the same teams meeting in consecutive FA Cup finals until Manchester United and Manchester City met in both the 2023 and 2024 FA Cup finals.

Afterwards, the domination in the competition that the club had enjoyed began to lessen as more teams strengthened. The trophy was reclaimed in 1890 with a replay win over Vale of Leven and the club&#x27;s 10th and final success came in 1893 with a 2–1 win over Celtic at Ibrox. In the same year, professional football was acknowledged by the SFA. Three years previously, the Scottish Football League had been formed but Queen&#x27;s declined to join, stressing their amateur principles. Queen&#x27;s Park joined the Scottish League in 1900 and took part in the 1900–01 season (being added directly to the top division rather than the lower division).

Nevertheless, the Queen&#x27;s players of the time were held in high regard throughout the country and some are still remembered today. Charles Campbell won eight Scottish Cup winners medals with Queen&#x27;s and earned 13 Scotland caps. Wattie Arnott was a near ever-present in the successful teams of the 1880s. Robert Smyth McColl scored a remarkable number of goals for Queen&#x27;s and soon moved on to Newcastle United and Rangers. In an unprecedented move, he returned to Queen&#x27;s and scored six goals in his final match. Andrew Watson was the first black football player in Britain. He won three Scotland caps and starred in one of the club&#x27;s earliest sides. J.A.H Catton, a notable sports editor, named Watson in his all-time Scotland team in 1926.

====Pioneers of the modern passing game====

Queen&#x27;s Park are accredited with introducing a collective and &#x27;scientific&#x27; form of team based passing which would become known as &#x27;combination&#x27; football. Although rudimentary forms of passing existed prior to 1872, and Queen&#x27;s themselves appear to have indulged in this, the combination game as a systematic form of passing was being played by the club at the time of the first official international match between Scotland and England. This changed the nature of the Association game as the culture in London at this time was largely one of dribbling and &#x27;backing up&#x27;. Scotland&#x27;s promotion of the combination game would ultimately lead to the introduction of professionalism in England in 1885, due to the large importation of Scottish players (known as Scotch Professors) into the midlands and the north of England.

During the late 1860s and early 1870s the club practised regularly and experimented with playing styles. According to Richard Robinson, who wrote the club&#x27;s official 50th anniversary history,Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays were fixed upon as the nights for play... Whoever selected the teams on practising nights had the power to place their men on the field, or appoint substitutes, and the players shall be bound to adhere to their instructions. Robinson also explains the means by which the passing game was developed, The club... never neglected practice, and this practice was indulged in systematically. Sides were arranged— North v. South of Eglinton Toll, Reds v. Blues, Light v. Heavy Weights, President&#x27;s Team v. J. Smith&#x27;s Team (a series of six games), and Clerks v. The Field, etc. In these games the dribbling and passing, which raised the Scottish game to the level of a fine art, were developed. Dribbling was a characteristic of English play, and it was not until very much later that the Southerners came to see that the principles laid down in the Queen&#x27;s Park method of transference of the ball, accompanied by strong backing up, were those which got the most out of a team. Combination was the chief characteristic of the Queen&#x27;s Park play. Queen&#x27;s were certainly playing a passing game by the time of their FA Cup tie (March 1872) with Wanderers, the most successful English side of the 1870s. Of the Queen&#x27;s Park team, &quot;The Field&quot; magazine notes that, &quot;They dribble little and usually convey the ball by a series of long kicks, combined with a judicious plan of passing on.&quot; It is the first official international match, played on 30 November 1872, where the first reference is given to their style as a culture of passing. &quot;The Graphic&quot;, a London-based weekly illustrated newspaper, provides the following insight into the game,

Individual skill was generally on England&#x27;s side, the dribbling of Kirke-Smith, Brockbank and Ottaway being very fine, while Welch, half-back, showed himself a safe and good kick. The Southrons, however, did not play to each other so well as their opponents, who seem to be adepts in passing the ball.
&quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; report on the game makes the following observation of the differences between both sides,

The Englishmen had all the advantage of weight, their average being about two stones heavier than the Scotchmen and they had also the advantage in pace. The strong point of the home club was that they played excellently well together.

The newspaper article which features Queen&#x27;s Park&#x27;s 5–0 victory over Wanderers in October 1875 (a match in which C.W. Alcock and the Anglo Scot A.F. Kinnaird played in for Wanderers) gives a concise description of the style of combination adopted by the club, particularly in the section which describes the second and third goals,

After a &quot;hand&quot; within thirty yards of the Wanderers&#x27; lines, Weir got possession, and, successfully charging the English forwards, passed it on to Herriot, who in turn placed it to Campbell, who by a well judged kick dropped the ball just below the bar, thus securing another goal for the Scotsmen in sixteen minutes. No sooner had the English captain started the ball than Herriot, Weir and Lawrie, by neat passing sent it back, and after the backs and half backs had shown good play, the two M&#x27;Neills brought it along the left side, and passing it to Lawrie, the latter made a shot for goal, but the ball passed just outside the goal post. The play was now in the centre, the Queen&#x27;s Park men dribbling and passing, while their opponents indulged chiefly in heavy kicking. In 33 minutes from the commencement of operations H. M&#x27;Neill, obtaining possession, kicked the ball to Herriot, who unselfishly serving it to Lawrie, the latter again made a shot for goal, this time with more success, as the ball, passing above the goalkeeper&#x27;s head, went clean through thus obtaining the third goal.

====Queen&#x27;s Park in the Football Association====

In 1870 Queen&#x27;s joined The Football Association which is based in London – the only football governing body in existence at the time. Their main attraction was to the new Challenge Cup and contributions were made to pay for the trophy. Queen&#x27;s reached the first semi-finals in 1872 but had to withdraw due to lack of funds after drawing their first competitive match 0–0 with The Wanderers at the Kennington Oval. Financial constraints meant that Queen&#x27;s played little part in the competition until 1884 where they stormed to the final before losing 2–1 to Blackburn Rovers at The Oval. Another loss to Blackburn the following year was the closest Queen&#x27;s got to winning the English trophy. In 1887, Scottish clubs were banned from entering by the Scottish Football Association. Although the solid crossbar first appeared in the Sheffield Rules code, Queen&#x27;s Park was responsible for its use in Association football when the club successfully put forward a motion for its introduction at a meeting of the Football Association in 1875.

Queen&#x27;s Park were invited to play in the annual Sheriff of London Charity Shield, a precursor of the FA Community Shield in 1899 which pitted the best amateur and professional sides of the season against each other. They would play the Football League First Division champions Aston Villa. The amateur side was usually represented by Corinthian, however Queen&#x27;s Park had defeated them 4–1 at Hampden Park earlier that year and the trophy committee decided that they deserved the honour. The match ended in a scoreless draw which saw the sides share the honour, holding the trophy for six months each.

=== Queen&#x27;s in the Scottish League top flight (1900–58)===
However, as the 20th century drew nearer, Queen&#x27;s found themselves playing in only cup competitions and the Glasgow League. A remarkable run to the 1900 Scottish Cup final saw Queen&#x27;s only narrowly lose 4–3 to Celtic. The previous 25 years had Queen&#x27;s achieve great success in cup competition but after ten years of resistance they finally took the big step to the Scottish League, first entering Division One in 1900–01.
Queen&#x27;s struggled with top-flight football and the professional sides which surrounded them. An early high-point was a 1–0 victory over Celtic at the opening of the new Hampden Park in 1903. By previous standards, however, unspectacular seasons followed and the club even finished in the relegation zone on five occasions. Queen&#x27;s were spared by vote until 1922 when, after a few solid seasons, the team were eventually relegated in second-last place. Queen&#x27;s bounced back immediately, winning Division Two at the first attempt. In a league season of 24 victories and only five defeats, the Spiders even managed a 4–3 win over Celtic in the Glasgow Cup, with James McAlpine scoring a hat-trick. McAlpine&#x27;s fine play inspired Queen&#x27;s to their greatest ever placing in the Scottish League, when they finished 5th in Division One in 1929. He would go on to set a goal scoring record for the club and his appearance record was only beaten by Ross Caven at the turn of the next century. In 1928, the same side also came closest to any Spiders team since 1900 to winning the Scottish Cup but lost 2–1 to Celtic in the semi-finals.

World War II helped Queen&#x27;s stay in the top league a little longer as at the end of 1938–39 season, the club were relegated. Six seasons in the Southern League followed, and it gave youth and many new players a chance to develop at Hampden as the players of before left to serve their country. Bobby Brown was one such player who started at Queen&#x27;s in 1939 but left in 1941 to serve as a pilot. When he returned at the end of the War, he found his goalkeeping position occupied by a teenage Ronnie Simpson who had made his debut at the age of 14. Although obviously a bleak time for everyone, this period gave many footballers at Queen&#x27;s Park an opportunity to play at the highest level under little pressure.

When War ended, Queen&#x27;s joined the Scottish &#x27;A&#x27; Division, where they stayed for three seasons, before relegation in 1948. The next few years were erratic but gradually a great team came together. Fourth place in 1954–55 was followed by first in 1955–56. The side was composed of players familiar with each other and the success was a reward for such longstanding legends as Charlie Church and Bert Cromar. Cromar played in every league game, as did goalkeeper Frank Crampsey (brother of journalist and Queen&#x27;s fan Bob), who kept 17 clean sheets. Queen&#x27;s only lasted two seasons in the top Division and were relegated in 1958, having only won four league games all season, and losing heavily on many occasions.

===League reconstruction (1958–1994)===

With stalwarts such as Cromar, Hastie and Omand all having moved on, the mid-1960s saw a new side which promised much. Future Scotland Internationalist Bobby Clark played in goal in 1964–65 season as Queen&#x27;s finished fourth. That finish was again achieved in 1968, with Queen&#x27;s winning 20 games (eight in succession towards the end) and scoring 76 goals. It was a formidable side which featured established Spiders Malky Mackay Sr. (the father of Malky Mackay), Peter Buchanan and Eddie Hunter. Ultimately, no success was gained, however, and as that side splintered, the club toiled until the mid-70s.

The 1975–76 season saw the reconstruction of the Scottish Leagues and Queen&#x27;s entered the Second Division (third tier). Coinciding with this, Queen&#x27;s appointed a head coach for the first time. Davie McParland led Queen&#x27;s to 4th place but left at the end of the season to join Partick Thistle. Joe Gilroy was his successor and Queen&#x27;s finished 5th, 7th and 13th under his guidance before his departure at the end of 1978–79.

Former player Eddie Hunter took charge and within two seasons, Queen&#x27;s had been promoted as 1980–81 champions. The talent in the side was obvious. Derek Atkins was an ever-present in goal, John McGregor a high scoring defender and Jimmy Nicholson and Gerry McCoy netted a combined tally of 28 goals. Much of the side was inexperienced, with full-back Bobby Dickson one of the few who had been a mainstay in previous years. After a highly respectable finish of 8th the following season, Queen&#x27;s finished bottom and were relegated in 1983. The main reason for this was the loss of some of the best players who had won promotion. In particular, John McGregor and Alan Irvine departed, leaving for Liverpool and Everton respectively. During the same season, Queen&#x27;s lost 2–1 to Rangers at Hampden in the Scottish Cup quarter-finals.

Recovery took a while but eventually a good side featuring Stevie Ross, Kenny Brannigan, Ian McCall and Ross Caven finished 4th in 1985–86 – winning three more games than the Championship side of 1981. Queen&#x27;s lost narrowly by 2–1 at Celtic Park in the Fourth round of the Scottish Cup in the February 1986.

1987–88 was a further improvement but 21 victories was only enough for 3rd place. 1990–91 was another season of frustration as Queen&#x27;s squandered a chance for promotion after having been in contention for so long and finished 5th, only four points behind 2nd place Montrose.

===Modern history (1994–2019)===

Eddie Hunter was fired as the club&#x27;s manager in December 1994 as Queen&#x27;s failed to recapture the achievements of the previous decade. Former Alloa Athletic manager Hugh McCann was appointed as his successor but after an 8th-place finish in the new 10 team Third Division, he left the club. Graeme Elder took over as player/coach but the team continued their disappointing run and he eventually resigned. A happier memory from this time was the 5–1 demolition of Albion Rovers at Hampden in August 1997, the opposition finishing the match with seven players. There was also an incredible 5–5 draw at East Fife in Hunter&#x27;s last season, with fan favourite Brian McPhee scoring four goals for Queen&#x27;s.

====Constitutional change====

The club&#x27;s constitution was changed prior to the appointment of the next manager, which meant that Queen&#x27;s could sign former professionals provided they were not paid by the club. Former Dundee manager John McCormack was unveiled in July 1998 as the new head coach. Like Eddie Hunter, McCormack succeeded in winning the league after just two seasons. The new boss used the new legislation to great effect and even persuaded the club to allow the loaning of professionals. The ex-pros and the committed amateurs combined to give Queen&#x27;s a superb start to the league season and it was November before defeat was felt. A 4–0 loss to challengers Forfar Athletic towards the end of the season was quickly forgotten as Queen&#x27;s won their last five matches, clinching the Championship at Cowdenbeath on the final day of 1999–2000. The addition of ex-pros such as Neil Inglis, Paul Martin, Graham Connell and Johnny Whelan helped. The late loan signing of Paul Walker from Stranraer also proved to be very shrewd as he scored two winning goals in the final run-in. After nearly 20 years of service to the club, Ross Caven won a Championship medal and there was also success for the hard-working Danny Ferry who had been with Queen&#x27;s through the lean spells of the 90s.

====Promotions and relegations====
Having won promotion, the Spiders only lasted one season in the Second Division. A good start was made but after the New Year results became increasingly hard to come by and Queen&#x27;s were relegated on the last day on goal difference. The following season featured a new and largely inexperienced team and Queen&#x27;s did not win a match until November. There was a period of revival for the team and some great results were achieved, but the poor start meant that Queen&#x27;s finished bottom of the Third Division, and thus, bottom of Scottish football, for the first time in their history. The start to the following season was unspectacular but the team managed to get to the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup before losing 4–3 to Brechin City at Hampden. Months before, McCormack had been made part-time by Queen&#x27;s. When Morton made an approach for his services in November 2002, he left to take the full-time position.

After a lengthy wait, former player Kenny Brannigan was announced as the new manager of Queen&#x27;s Park in January 2003. His short term at the club was unsuccessful and only a couple of memorable results were achieved, notably a 2–1 win over Inverness Caledonian Thistle in the League Cup. A reasonable start to season 2004–05 came to a halt when Brannigan physically confronted a player and a supporter during a match against Elgin City. Queen&#x27;s lost the match 1–0 and Brannigan lost his job.

Billy Stark was installed as Kenny Brannigan&#x27;s replacement in August 2004 and the season ended with Queen&#x27;s in 4th place. Inconsistency prevented Queen&#x27;s from reaching the first ever play-offs the following season but in 2006–07 the Spiders were promoted. Not unlike the successful side of 1981, there were few veterans, and the team mostly consisted of young players with little or no experience of football away from Queen&#x27;s Park. In August 2006, Queen&#x27;s defeated SPL side Aberdeen in a League Cup penalty shoot-out to record one of their greatest ever victories. League form dramatically improved after the New Year as only one home match was lost in the second half of the season. Queen&#x27;s went on a run of eight consecutive victories, during which goalkeeper David Crawford set a new club record by keeping seven successive shut-outs. Queen&#x27;s finished 3rd in the league, acquiring only one less point than the side which had won the Championship 7 years earlier. Promotion was achieved via the play-offs. Queen&#x27;s defeated Arbroath in the semi-finals 4–1 on aggregate and then East Fife in the final 7–2 on aggregate. Richard Sinclair and Frankie Carroll became the first players in the club&#x27;s history to win promotion on more than one occasion. Queen&#x27;s Park&#x27;s cavalier playing style was one which was lauded by coaches from opposition sides during the season and they were acknowledged as being well worthy of their promotion.

Combining the end of the promotion season and the start of 2007–08, Queen&#x27;s managed 11 consecutive victories (8 league wins) in all competition. Although Billy Stark had signed a new contract in the summer of 2007, he left midway through the following season to take the managerial post of the Scotland under-21s.

====Gardner Speirs and young talent====

Stark was replaced in February 2008 by Gardner Speirs who secured safety from relegation and an 8th-place finish. Queen&#x27;s lost many talented players in the summer of 2008 to paying clubs but only narrowly lost 2–1 to Celtic in the Scottish Cup fifth round in February 2009.

After finishing 9th in the Second Division in season 2008–09 and then being defeated in the end-of-season play-off semi-finals (losing 1–2 on aggregate v Stenhousemuir), Queen&#x27;s Park were relegated to the Third Division. In January 2010, David Murray scored the &quot;Spiders&quot; 3000th competitive home goal.

Despite poor starts in their last two Third Division campaigns, on both occasions Queen&#x27;s Park did enough to qualify for the end of season playoffs. They lost at the semi-final stage in both ties, firstly to Arbroath and then to Albion Rovers. In season 2012–13, faced with greater public scrutiny due to Rangers being accepted into the bottom tier, Queen&#x27;s had their best season in years, finishing third and playing attractive attacking football. They failed to achieve promotion in the play-offs, losing to Peterhead, and the side, which contained players such as Andrew Robertson, Lawrence Shankland, Aidan Connolly, Paul McGinn and Blair Spittal was broken up in the close season.

In season 2014–15 Queen&#x27;s Park finished 2nd and qualified for the Scottish league one playoffs. In the first leg, the Spiders drew with Arbroath 2–2 at Gayfield Park before defeating them in the home leg thanks to a 118th minute winner from Queen&#x27;s defender Tony Quinn. In the second leg, which would determine the winner of the playoff and subsequent promotion, Queen&#x27;s Park were defeated 1–0 by Stenhousemuir in the first leg at Hampden Park. In the away leg at Ochilview Park, Queen&#x27;s Park would draw 1–1 with the Warriors, meaning Queen&#x27;s Park would play League Two football the following season.

====150th anniversary====
After finishing fourth in the 2015–16 league season, they were promoted after beating Clyde in the playoff final. Queen&#x27;s Park celebrated their 150th birthday on 9 July 2017, with events held to mark the occasion. Following a ninth-place finish in 2017–18, they were relegated to Scottish League Two at the end of the season after a 3–2 aggregate loss to Stenhousemuir in the play-offs.

In the 2018–19 Scottish Challenge Cup, the Spiders recorded a 4–2 penalty win over Champions League regulars, The New Saints of the Welsh Premier League in the second round of the competition.

===Queen&#x27;s turn professional (2019–present)===
====Back to back promotions, return to the second tier====

A major change to the club&#x27;s constitution was proposed in 2019, with its members asked if they wished to end amateur status and to allow the hiring of professional players. Part of the motivation for the proposal was that several good players had been lost without the club receiving any compensation due to its status. The club&#x27;s members voted to move to professional status following a motion on 14 November 2019. 91% of QPFC members elected to go pro, enabling the club to sign players to longer-term contracts and collect transfer fees.

Former Dundee United and Falkirk coach Ray McKinnon was appointed as the club&#x27;s new head coach in January 2020. He became the first manager of Queen&#x27;s Park since the 1980s to secure two wins in his first two matches in charge, before the league two season was ended prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the summer of 2020, Queen&#x27;s Park signed many professional players from higher placed Scottish teams, including former Dundee United striker Simon Murray, and the team went on to win the 2020–21 Scottish League Two title and gain promotion to League One.

On 12 January 2021, former Motherwell and Hibernian CEO Leeann Dempster was appointed as the club&#x27;s new chief executive. Dempster announced she would be stepping down from her role in January 2024.

Ray McKinnon would leave his role as head coach at the end of the 2020–21 season. He was replaced by Queen&#x27;s stalwart Laurie Ellis in the close season but Ellis would be relieved of his duties in December 2021 following a downturn in form.

Owen Coyle was announced as the new manager of Queen&#x27;s Park in March 2022. Queen&#x27;s Park were promoted to the 2022–23 Scottish Championship after beating Dunfermline Athletic 1–0 in the play–off semi-final and then beating Airdrieonians 3–2 in the final of the Championship play-off, thus securing back to back promotions from the fourth to the second tier of Scottish football.

In their first season back in the second tier, Queen&#x27;s narrowly missed out on automatic promotion to the Scottish Premiership and were beaten in the Premiership play-offs by city rivals Partick Thistle. Owen Coyle announced he would be stepping down from his role shortly thereafter.

In June 2023, in what was hailed as an ambitious move by the club, Queen&#x27;s Park announced that former Ajax and Anderlecht coach Robin Veldman had been appointed as their new head coach. After a slump in form following a promising start to the league campaign, Veldman left his position on 9 December 2023.

Former St Johnstone manager Callum Davidson was announced as the club&#x27;s new head coach in January 2024. He would go on to make multiple high profile signings such as Danny Wilson, Cammy Kerr, and Zak Rudden.

On 3 May 2024, Queen&#x27;s Park finished the 2023–24 Scottish Championship season in 8th place, narrowly avoiding a relegation play-off spot thanks to a 2–0 win over Airdrieonians at Hampden Park after a difficult season.

On 27 July 2024, Queen&#x27;s Park progressed out of the Scottish League Cup group stage for the first time in the new structure after beating Kelty Hearts 6–0. On 17 August 2024 Queen&#x27;s travelled to Pittodrie Stadium to face Aberdeen in the cup&#x27;s second round where they would narrowly lose 1–0 in added time.

On 9 February 2025, Queen&#x27;s Park travelled to Ibrox for a Fifth Round Scottish Cup match and achieved &quot;One of the greatest shocks in Scottish football history&quot; when they won by a goal to nil.

== Rivals and friendships==
Despite being located midway between Celtic and Rangers, Queen&#x27;s Park&#x27;s former resistance to professionalism resulted in the club not competing in the same division as those teams for long periods of time, and thus turning to rivals in lower divisions, such as Partick Thistle, Clyde, Albion Rovers and Third Lanark (the latter being the Spiders&#x27; closest neighbours until they went defunct in 1967).

Since the mid-2000s, Queen&#x27;s Park supporters have had a strong relationship with German Oberliga side SG Wattenscheid 09 due to the similarities between the two clubs, including the traditional black and white playing colours of each clubs home jerseys.

===Supporters===

Queen&#x27;s Park have had a supporters&#x27; association since 1947 and currently have members around the world in dozens of countries. The Queen&#x27;s Park Supporters&#x27; Association (QPSA) organise bus travel for away fixtures, organise fundraisers, sell unofficial merchandise, organise quiz nights and other social gatherings and publish monthly newsletters to their members.
Queen&#x27;s Parks more vocal supporters go by the alias of the &#x27;Irn Bru Firm&#x27; due to the club&#x27;s previous long standing connection to the soft drink. The &#x27;Irn Bru Firm&#x27; tend to congregate at the back of section P2 in Hampden Park where they will stand and sing traditional chants. At away games, the &#x27;Irn Bru Firm&#x27; will stand, chant, clap and hang flags with Queen&#x27;s Park related text or images.

== Kit history ==

== Stadium ==

When Queen&#x27;s Park was formed in 1867, the club initially played on the Queen&#x27;s Park Recreation Ground at Crosshill, from where they took their name. In 1873 they moved to their first enclosed ground, naming it Hampden Park after a nearby street, Hampden Terrace. A grandstand and pavilion were erected over the next few years and the ground became a regular venue for international matches and cup finals, but in 1883 the club were forced to vacate the site to make way for the construction of the Cathcart Circle railway. After a year playing at Clydesdale Cricket Club&#x27;s Titwood ground, a second Hampden was opened in October 1884. Whilst the club continued to attract major fixtures, they faced increasing competition as other Glasgow venues such as Celtic Park and Ibrox were developing their facilities more rapidly. To maintain their position in Scottish football, Queen&#x27;s Park decided to purchase some farmland at Mount Florida, where the third Hampden was opened in 1903. Second Hampden was subsequently taken over by Third Lanark, who renamed it after their previous ground, Cathkin Park.

Hampden celebrated its centenary on 31 October 2003. The stadium also houses the offices of the Scottish Football Association (SFA) and the Scottish Football Museum. Despite its large capacity and worldwide profile, it was owned by Queen&#x27;s Park and leased by the SFA until 2020. It is the national football stadium of Scotland, the venue for all major cup finals and most Scotland international fixtures, and has hosted several UEFA competition finals. 
Hampden Park was the largest stadium in the world until 1950, when the Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro was completed. Many of the record attendances in football were set at Hampden in the mid-20th century. After the release of the Taylor Report in the wake of the Hillsborough disaster, among other football tragedies, it was converted to an all-seater. Hampden&#x27;s capacity following redevelopment was , although Queen&#x27;s Park&#x27;s average league attendance is around 1,800.

With matches in the 2012 Olympic Games having been played there, Hampden was converted into an athletics venue to be the main stadium of the 2014 Commonwealth Games. This meant Queen&#x27;s Park had to move its home games to the Excelsior Stadium in Airdrie for a full year; the cup finals and Scotland matches also went elsewhere. The stadium has hosted other sports including rugby union, American football, motorcycle speedway and boxing, as well as many music concerts.

Lesser Hampden is a smaller ground to the west of the main stadium which Queen&#x27;s Park traditionally used for training and reserve team or youth matches. In 2018, a deal was made for the SFA to purchase Hampden from Queen&#x27;s Park upon the expiry of the lease in 2020 for a fee of £5 million, with the club intending to improve Lesser Hampden and play their matches there. In November 2019 the club announced plans to redevelop Lesser Hampden into a 1,774 capacity ground. As of August 2020, ownership of the main stadium had been transferred to the SFA and a new facility was under construction at Lesser Hampden. Queen&#x27;s Park played their last match at Hampden on 20 March 2021, as their lease on the ground expired at the end of the month. They groundshared at the Falkirk Stadium for the rest of the 2020–21 season, Firhill during 2021–22, and Ochilview in 2022–23. The club released a revised plan in December 2021.

On 8 June 2023, Queen&#x27;s announced that they entered an agreement with the Scottish Football Association to use Hampden Park as their ground for home matches ahead of the upcoming season. This agreement was then extended into the 2024–25 season.

<doc id="426315" wikidata="Q947731" url="?curid=426315" title="Tie (music)">
<text>In music notation, a tie is a curved line connecting the heads of two notes of the same pitch, indicating that they are to be played as a single note with a duration equal to the sum of the individual notes&#x27; values. A tie is similar in appearance to a slur; however, slurs join notes of different pitches which need to be played independently, but seamlessly (legato).

Ties are used for three reasons: (a) when holding a note across a bar line; (b) when holding a note across a beat within a bar, i.e. to allow the beat to be clearly seen; and (c) for unusual note lengths which cannot be expressed in standard notation.

==Explanation==
A writer in 1901, said that the following definition is preferable to the previous:
Other sources:


Ties are normally placed opposite the stem direction of the notes, unless there are two or more voices simultaneously.

The tie shown at the top right connects a quarter note (crotchet) to a sixteenth note (semiquaver), creating a note as long as a quarter note, or five times as long as a sixteenth note—there is no single note value to express this duration. However, in some cases one might tie two notes that could be written with a single note value, such as a quarter note tied to an eighth note (the same length as a dotted quarter). This might be because:

*A barline is between the notes
::&lt;score&gt;
\relative c&quot; {
 b1~ b
}&lt;/score&gt;

*The second note begins a metric grouping, falling on a stressed beat of the meter. This change in notation (choosing the tie rather than the longer note value) does not affect performance, but it makes the music easier to read. Sometimes it can be used to make it clear that it has the appropriate rhythm. For example, a measure with three equal notes would have a quarter note on each side but two tied eighth notes in the middle; a measure with three equal notes would have all quarter notes.

::&lt;score&gt;

\relative c&quot; {
 \time 6/8 b4 b8~ b b4

Several notes in succession can be tied together. Such a succession can also be part of a larger, slurred phrase, in which case, ties and slurs must be used simultaneously and distinguishably.

==History==
The tie first appeared in 1523 in the Recerchari, motetti, canzoni by Marco Antonio Cavazzoni. The tie was used to show the duration of differing harmonies on early figured basses to show how they should be sounded over the held bass note. Many early pianists, like Beethoven, used the tie in many pieces to show the demand of gentle reiteration.

<text>A slur is a symbol in Western musical notation indicating that the notes it embraces are to be played without separation (that is, with legato articulation). A slur is denoted with a curved line generally placed over the notes if the stems point downward, and under them if the stems point upwards.

The example below shows two measures in with a slur for each measure:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&quot; {
 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;violin&quot;
 \key e \minor \time 6/8
 e16( dis e fis g b, c d e gis, a b)
 c( e, f g! a c, d e f g a b)
}&lt;/score&gt;

== Performance ==
Slurs mean different things for different instruments:

*For bowed string instruments, the notes should be played in one bow stroke.
* For plucked string instruments, such as guitars, the notes should be played without plucking the individual strings (hammer-ons and pull-offs).
* For wind instruments, the notes should be played without re-articulating each note (tonguing), except for the slide trombone (and other instruments that control the pitch with a slide), on which only certain kinds of combinations can be played with no tongue without making a glissando – thus &quot;legato tonguing&quot; is employed.
* For vocal music, slurs are usually used to mark notes which are sung to a single syllable (melisma).

A slur can be extended over many notes, sometimes encompassing several bars. In extreme cases, composers are known to write slurs which are near-impossible to achieve; in that case the composer wishes to emphasise that the notes should be performed with as much legato as possible.

<text>The Barbary dove, ringed turtle dove, ringneck dove, ring-necked turtle dove, or ring dove (&quot;Streptopelia risoria&quot;) is a domestic member of the dove and pigeon family (Columbidae).

== Taxonomy and domestication ==
The Barbary dove was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the doves and pigeons in the genus &quot;Columba&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Columba risoria&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as India. The specific epithet &quot;risoria&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;laughing&quot;. The Barbary dove was formerly believed to be a domesticated form of the Eurasian collared dove (&quot;Streptopelia decaocto&quot;), but genetic evidence has shown that it is a domesticated form of the African collared dove (&quot;Streptopelia roseogrisea&quot;).

There is a disagreement as to whether &quot;risoria&quot; should replace &quot;roseogrisea&quot; as the epithet for the African collared dove. In 2008 the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature expressed an opinion that &quot;risoria&quot; should have priority, but this change has not been followed in the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela C. Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC), or by the Clements Checklist of Birds of the World maintained by members of Cornell University.

It appears that it can hybridize freely with either species, and its status as a species must therefore be regarded as doubtful. However, because of the wide use of both the common and systematic names, it is best to consider it separately from either of the parent species. Their time of domestication is also uncertain. While Linnaeus described them in 1758, they may have been imported into Italy from North Africa in the late 16th century.

== Behavior ==
Barbary doves are easily kept and long-lived in captivity, living for up to 12 years. There have been cases of doves living over 20 years, and, in one case, of a dove living for 29 years. In recent years they have been used extensively in biological research, particularly into the hormonal bases of reproductive behaviour, because their sequences of courtship, mating and parental behaviour have been described accurately and are highly consistent in form. Dove fanciers have bred them in a great variety of colours; the number of colours available has increased dramatically in the latter half of the 20th century, and it is thought that this has been achieved by interbreeding with &quot;Streptopelia roseogrisea&quot;. 

Some of these doves carry a mutation that makes them completely white. These white Barbary doves are most commonly used in stage magic acts. White Barbary doves are also traditionally released in large public ceremonies, since it is a peace symbol in several cultures, and &quot;dove releases&quot; are also sometimes found at weddings and funerals. However, a release dove is, in fact, usually a homing pigeon, as Barbary doves lack the homing instinct.

The &quot;coo&quot; of the Barbary dove is created by muscles that vibrate air sent up from the dove&#x27;s lungs. These muscles belong to the fastest known class of vertebrate muscles, contracting as much as 10 times faster than muscles vertebrates use for running. This class of muscles is usually found in high speed tissue such as a rattlesnake&#x27;s tail. Barbary doves are the first bird species to have been found to have this class of muscle.

=== Breeding ===
They can be crossed with the pigeon to create offspring, but the offspring are not fertile.

<text>The African collared dove (Streptopelia roseogrisea) is a small dove found in the Sahel, northern parts of the Horn of Africa and southwestern Arabia. Although it lives in arid lands, it is found around water sources.

This bird is typically around in length. Its upper body, from shoulders to tail, is a pale grayish brown, though the wing edge has a bluish tinge. Flight feathers are darker, and nearly black. Head, neck and breast are pinkish shading to white on the chin and belly. There is little sexual dimorphism.

The African collared dove is the species thought to be the wild ancestor of the domestic Barbary dove, though some suggest the Eurasian collared dove (&quot;Streptopelia decaocto&quot;) may also have been involved. The African collared dove is able to hybridise with the Barbary dove, and it is thought that the increase in the range of colours of Barbary doves available that occurred in the later 20th century was the result of the importation of African collared doves into the United States for interbreeding.

It is reported to have been introduced into New Zealand, but it is more likely that the birds there are descended from domestic Barbary doves.

Streptopelia roseogrisea has a diet of grass seeds and other plants. They would also eat berries, insects, and snails.

<text>Jennifer Helen Jones, Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb, (born 23 December 1949) is a British politician who served as Deputy Mayor of London from 2003 to 2004. A member of the Green Party of England and Wales, she was until September 2019 the sole Green Party member in the House of Lords.

Jones represented the Green Party in the London Assembly from its creation in 2000 until standing down in 2016. She was the Green candidate for Mayor of London in the 2012 election, coming third with 4.48% of first preferences. She served as Deputy Mayor of London from May 2003 to June 2004. She was also the sole Green councillor on Southwark Council from 2006 to 2010.

On the London Assembly, Jones&#x27;s prime areas of interest were transport, housing and planning, and policing, &quot;with a strong emphasis on sustainability and localism&quot;. In addition to her period as deputy mayor, Jones served as Chair of London Food, Green Transport Advisor, and Road Safety Ambassador. It was announced at the beginning of August 2013 that she was to become the first Green life peer in the House of Lords since Tim Beaumont. She was introduced to the House of Lords on 5 November 2013.

==Early life and career==
Jones grew up on the Moulsecoomb estate in Brighton, She attended the co-educational Westlain Grammar School (was Falmer High School now BACA). Before entering politics, Jones worked as a financial controller in London. She studied environmental archaeology at the UCL Institute of Archaeology as a mature student, graduating with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in 1991. She spent about 10 years in the Middle East, working on paleobotany, before embarking on a career in politics.

==Political career==
Jones joined the Green Party (UK) in 1988, which splintered two years later into three parties, one of which is the Green Party of England and Wales. She has held several posts within the party, including the position of chair on the executive from 1995 to 1997.

=== London Assembly member ===
In the 2000 election, Jones won a place in the inaugural London Assembly as part of a three-strong Green Group, including Councillor Darren Johnson AM and Victor Anderson, who resigned in March 2003 and was replaced by Noel Lynch for the remainder of the term. The 2004 GLA elections saw the Greens lose the seat held by Lynch, leaving Jones and Johnson as the two remaining members of the Green Group.

In May 2003, the Green Party, after some internal dissent, accepted an offer from the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, to nominate a deputy mayor; they chose Jones, who held the post until June 2004. The offer was part of Livingstone&#x27;s pledge to rotate the position of deputy mayor, although he later declined to offer the post to the Conservatives and had an offer to the Liberal Democrats turned down.

As a London Assembly Member, Jenny Jones promoted the issues of road safety, food, sustainable transport, social justice and the police and civil liberties.

She was a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority, and has issued a report on traffic policing. She sat on both the MPA&#x27;s Strategic and Operational Policing Committee and Civil Liberties Panel. Elsewhere she put forward a motion and has put questions to the Mayor calling for progress on women&#x27;s issues, specifically in relation to violence against women and support provision.

Jones chaired the Planning and Housing Committee, which issued a report on food growing and planning in London, Cultivating the Capital. It concluded that &quot;London has only three or four days stocks of food should there be any disruption to supply&quot;. Jones issued an individual report in January 2010 on affordable housing in London, which determined that &quot;the cost of buying a home [in London] has risen twice as fast as incomes&quot;.

She was also a member of the Confirmation Hearings and Transport Committees.

She previously held roles as the Mayor&#x27;s Road Safety Ambassador and Green Transport advisor, focusing on road safety and cycling in London respectively, as well as being the former Chair of London Food, a mayoral commission which &quot;aims to give Londoners fresher, healthier and more affordable food while reducing the environmental impact of our current food supply&quot;. As Chair, Jones was responsible for drawing up the Sustainable Food Strategy for London and chaired the Food Implementation Group overseeing the strategy More recently, she also issued a report on the subject of food security in the capital.

=== Southwark Councillor ===
In the 2006 local elections, Jones was elected as a councillor for the South Camberwell ward in the London Borough of Southwark, the Greens&#x27; first councillor in Southwark. She came third in the ward, polling 1014 votes. In the 2010 elections she lost her seat, coming fifth with 1282 votes.

=== Parliamentary candidate ===
In the 2005 general election, Jones stood in the Dulwich and West Norwood parliamentary constituency, coming fourth with 2,741 votes (6.5%).

In the 2010 general election, she stood in the Camberwell and Peckham parliamentary constituency, coming fourth with 1,361 votes (2.9%).

=== Mayoral candidate ===
In March 2011, Jones was selected as the Green Party&#x27;s candidate for the 2012 London Mayoral election winning 67% of the votes against prominent Green Party members Dr Shahrar Ali and Farid Bakht, stating &quot;At this time of savage cuts to essential services, London needs a Mayor who will create a fairer city and reduce the gap between rich and poor. These are hard times for people who care about quality services, local businesses, and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities. I promise to make fighting cuts to housing benefit, the NHS and youth services a key part of my campaign to be Mayor.&quot;

At the election, she came third with 98,913 first preference votes (4.5%), but lost her deposit due to scoring less than 5% of the vote.

=== House of Lords ===
On 20 September 2013, Jones was created a Life Peer taking the title Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb, of Moulsecoomb in the County of East Sussex. She was nominated for this appointment by her party after a ballot of members. She was introduced to the House of Lords on 5 November 2013. She became the first Green Party peer since the death of Tim Beaumont, in 2008. Jones was joined in the House of Lords by Natalie Bennett, Baroness Bennett of Manor Castle, in October 2019.

==Political views==
=== Climate and ecological crisis ===
On 17 November 2018, Jones joined the demonstration organised in London by Extinction Rebellion. She told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that &quot;We are at the point where if we don’t start acting and acting fast we are just going to wipe out our life support system&quot; and that &quot;Basically, conventional politics has failed us – it’s even failed me and I’m part of the system – so people have no other choice&quot;.

===The City===
In her statement of policy for the 2012 election, Jones proposes several ideas to bring &quot;a renaissance of micro, small and medium businesses&quot; in order to spread &quot;wealth to all Londoners&quot;, seeking &quot;a financial services sector that works for them&quot;. She argues for a system that rewards good long-term investment &quot;instead of trying to make a fast buck&quot; and proposes a good financial example to be Sweden&#x27;s Handelsbanken which gives &quot;good basic pay and no bonuses.&quot; One of her candidacy&#x27;s most distinct positions is with respect to The City with ambitions to &quot;Abolish the City of London Corporation and replace it with a democratic London borough&quot;, &quot;support new institutions like local community banks focused on lending to small businesses and social enterprises&quot; and &quot;Promote building societies and credit unions and lobby the Government to put its remaining nationalised banking assets into one of these models rather than a bank&quot;. Elsewhere, Jones has been critical of excessive top-level remuneration, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s difficult not to feel enraged&quot; by statistics showing the average FTSE CEO earns 565 times the national average.

=== The European Union and Brexit ===
Jones is a Eurosceptic and advocated the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. Jones cited lack of democracy, waste and cost as her reasons for supporting Brexit. In October 2015, Jones gave her support to Vote Leave, an organisation campaigning to leave the European Union in the referendum in the UK. Jones cited the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and EU policies of austerity as part of a measure to deal with Greece&#x27;s national debt imposed by the European troika as reasons to support Brexit. She also argued that &#x27;the EU exists on too large a scale for genuine democratic oversight and accountability. The Green party believes that small is beautiful – and the EU is gigantist in its very nature.&#x27;
However, on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Any Questions&quot; on 8 June 2022, Jones argued that Brexit had now been seen to be causing economic and other damage, and that people should keep an open mind about the possibility of rejoining the EU in the future if it becomes clear that it would be better going forward for the people of the UK to do so. She has since stated that &#x27;The only sensible thing now is to cut our losses and rejoin the EU&#x27;. 

===Fair Pay ratio===
Jones and the Green Party, alongside others, are deeply critical of the inequalities in the pay between the rich people and poor people. Jones supports calls by the New Economics Foundation to introduce a 10:1 pay ratio, whereby the highest earner in a company or institution should earn no more than 10 times the lowest paid employee. Jones&#x27;s policy indicates that, if elected, this would be instigated in &quot;City Hall, Transport for London, the fire brigade and the police&quot;, and she claims &quot;more equal societies tend to be happier and healthier as well as experiencing lower levels of violent crime.&quot; This is a high priority for her candidacy and she states that &quot;this would mean that no City Hall cleaner could earn less than a tenth the Mayor’s salary, and the Commissioner of the Met Police couldn’t earn more than ten times a young recruit.&quot;

===Transgender issues===
Jones&#x27;s views on transgender issues have sometimes attracted media attention for differing from the Green Party&#x27;s line. She claims that she supports trans rights, but does not support self-identification of gender and, in March 2018, re-tweeted a statement that linked self-identification to cases of child abuse in Telford. In the same year, Jones claims that her crowdfunder leaflets were defaced with &quot;TERF&quot; at the Green Party conference. 

At the 2021 Conference, Jones spoke in favour of Motion E01, which argued that women were discriminated against &quot;solely upon their biological sex&quot;. This motion was defeated, following criticism that the motion excluded trans women.

===Healthy eating===
Jones has argued for big changes to London&#x27;s current food culture as Chair of London Food during Ken Livingstone&#x27;s second Mayoral term. During her time as chair, London Food released its ‘Food Strategy’ aiming to &quot;help improve food in London’s schools, hospitals and other public institutions&quot; and &quot;offer people on low income better access to healthy and affordable food&quot;. Some of the reports key points were:
* &quot;Consideration will be given to the role that the public sector can play in helping to facilitate more producer collaborations and logistics and distribution partnerships, to help smaller producers to compete in the market, and to encourage new entrants.&quot;
* &quot;Directing better the existing resources available for business support for specialist food manufacturers and processors, particularly on consumer market trends and collaborative working, and particularly for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) that reflect London’s diverse communities.&quot;
* &quot;Promote and expand opportunities for small-scale food production for individuals and communities through gardens, orchards, schools, allotments and parks and open spaces&quot;
* &quot;Continue to increase the amount of organic and local food provided through public sector services in London in response to growing consumer demand.&quot;
* &quot;Research and promote the positive benefits of nutritious food for children.&quot;

In 2008, Jones released a report ‘Why London Needs to Grow More Food’ stressing &quot;The Mayor of London has planning and development powers, which could be used to support widespread urban agriculture in London through the commercial and voluntary sectors, community-led social enterprises, and by engaging the unemployed, elderly, and lower skilled groups&quot;.

=== Housing ===
Jones sees tackling homelessness as a key and achievable target and criticised Johnson&#x27;s poor record: &quot;This rise in homelessness is unsurprising and depressing, but completely avoidable. One fifth of people became homeless just because their insecure tenancy ended, another fifth because they have had to move out of their parents’ home into the incredibly expensive rental market. With housing benefit cuts now biting deep into people&#x27;s incomes, this is only going to get worse.&quot; Jones proposes to &quot;bring all grants for pan-London homelessness services into the GLA to protect frontline services, and work closely with homelessness organisations to ensure nobody needs to spend a second night out sleeping rough on the street.&quot;

In her campaign for mayor, Jones has spoken against the inflationary effects of certain businesses, stating, &quot;we want to change the housing market from a playground for speculative investment to a source of secure, affordable homes&quot;. Jones has spoken in favour of community engagement in planning, specifically with regards to housing co-operatives. To help co-operatives develop, she proposes to &quot;establish the London Mutual Housing Company to help communities set-up Community Land Trusts, which will give them control over the design, development and management of permanently affordable homes.&quot; In addition to this, she proposes a scheme to build affordable homes and to give communities the means to bring unused buildings back into use. For the Greens fuel poverty is a big issue and &quot;Green London Assembly Members worked to secure the city&#x27;s largest home insulation programme and demonstrated how it could be funded to reach over a million homes.&quot;

=== Male curfew proposal ===
On 11 March 2021, following the disappearance of Sarah Everard, Jones proposed that a 6pm curfew for men is put in place. In her opinion this will help to make women feel safer and also reduce discrimination. Jones&#x27; proposals received criticism from the Conservative Party leader in the London Assembly Susan Hall, and former leader of Reform UK, Nigel Farage. Jones later said that the comment was &quot;not an entirely serious suggestion as I don&#x27;t have the power to do that&quot; and reiterated that a ban on men leaving their house was not Green Party policy.

===Police===
Jones was a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority from its creation in 2000 &quot;and has worked on a wide range of policing issues, with a particular focus on road safety, violence against women, civil liberties and neighbourhood policing&quot; until it was disbanded in 2012. She was outspoken about numerous issues including what she called mayor Boris Johnson&#x27;s demonisation of youth through the use of &quot;baseless&quot; rhetoric on &quot;soaring gang-membership and rising knife-crime&quot;, suggesting the mayor created an unhelpful climate of fear. Jones then served as a member of the MPA&#x27;s replacement body, the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee.

In response to the riots in August 2011, Jones and Green Party leader, Caroline Lucas MP co-authored an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, arguing that all cuts to policing should be postponed until December 2012 when a sufficient review of the events has occurred and the lessons from the London Olympics are learned, &quot;In the meantime, the police should focus on spending money wisely, and ensuring that police officers are not burdened with administrative tasks which take them away from frontline policing.&quot;

After herself being kettled at a students demonstration, Jones was vociferously critical of this police tactic, telling the BBC the police used kettling to &quot;imprison peaceful campaigners and have shown they can&#x27;t be trusted with such a powerful tactic&quot;, suggesting &quot;The Met&#x27;s reputation sinks even further every time they abuse their powers and it&#x27;s time to stop this particular mistreatment&quot;.

In June 2014, Jones penned an editorial in &quot;The Guardian&quot; wherein she criticised the surveillance tactics of police on activists. After going through the process now available through the Data Protection Act to get the police report on herself, she found that she was labelled a potential &quot;domestic extremist&quot;. She found that the report contained only publicly available information, such as tweets, and that nothing in it would suggest potentially dangerous activity. Jones has been under surveillance by the police&#x27;s &quot;domestic extremism&quot; unit from 2001 until 2012, including the time during her attempt to become London&#x27;s mayor. She viewed the revelation as both a violation of her privacy and a waste of police resources. She is now calling for a re-evaluation of police policies, especially in regards to political activists.

In January 2016, whistleblower Sgt David Williams claimed that the police&#x27;s &quot;domestic extremism&quot; unit shredded records &quot;related to&quot; Jones in June 2014, the month Jones met with the unit pressing for answers.

===Transport===
Jones commissioned the initial Transport for London report into promoting cycling that paved the way for the London Cycle-hire scheme. Ashok Sinha, Chief executive of the London Cycling Campaign, said of Jones &quot;In 2008 the London Cycling Campaign gave Jenny Jones a Special Award for her Lifetime Services to cycling. This was in recognition of her success in helping to push cycling into mainstream politics, her efforts to deliver many cycling projects on the ground, and her energies as cycling champion in general.&quot;.
In a confrontation with the Mayor over cycle safety, Johnson said:

Johnson&#x27;s advisor wrote to Jones claiming there had been:

Which turned out not to be true. In a written statement Jones said, &quot;we know that cycle safety is the big problem which puts Londoners off jumping on their bikes. There are a growing number of deaths and injuries of cyclists and trying to cover that up by issuing factually inaccurate statements won’t change the reality,&quot; continuing, &quot;We urgently need to fix the most dangerous junctions and reverse the Mayor’s policy of giving priority to motorised traffic. The Mayor needs to stand his policy on its head and give legal priority on many local roads to pedestrians and cyclists.&quot; Jones has also been critical of Johnson&#x27;s neglect of cycling in outer London, stating &quot;given that 70% of the potential new cyclists identified by TfL are outside of inner and central London, it is shocking that the Transport Strategy has no clear plan for cycling in the suburbs and outer London.&quot;

Jones has spoken against Boris Johnson&#x27;s transport policy of &quot;making motoring cheaper in London, whilst public transport fares are raised above inflation&quot;. At Mayor&#x27;s question time, Jones highlighted a &quot;promise&quot; Johnson had made in 2008 to make all new buses hybrid by 2012 when in reality less than 10% had met this criterion. Jones wishes for a reduction in the burden for Londoners felt by Johnson&#x27;s price increases and proposes a reduction in fares of about 4%. Jones supported the congestion charge as a way to lower pollution and road casualties and spoke against the mayor&#x27;s cancellation of the Western extension, arguing that it made London dirtier, more crowded and less safe. Jones favours replacing the congestion charge with a &quot;smart, pay-as-you drive scheme&quot;. Jones has also called for more people to use public transport and to reduce &quot;non-essential&quot; journeys, but has been criticised for frequently taking taxi journeys on expenses. Jones opposes High Speed 2 and states that its budget should be spent on local transport.

<doc id="426334" wikidata="Q622439" url="?curid=426334" title="Small and medium enterprises">
<text>Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) or small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are businesses whose personnel and revenue numbers fall below certain limits. The abbreviation &quot;SME&quot; is used by many national agencies and international organizations such as the World Bank, the OECD, European Union, the United Nations, and the World Trade Organization (WTO).

In any given national economy, SMEs outnumber large companies by a wide margin and also employ many more people.
On a global scale, SMEs make up 90% of all companies and more than 50% of all employment. For example, in the EU, 99% of all businesses are SMEs. Australian SMEs makeup 98% of all Australian businesses, produce one-third of the total GDP (gross domestic product) and employ 4.7 million people. In Chile, in the commercial year 2014, 98.5% of the firms were classified as SMEs. In Tunisia, the self-employed workers alone account for about 28% of the total non-farm employment, and firms with fewer than 100 employees account for about 62% of total employment. United States&#x27; SMEs generate half of all U.S. jobs, but only 40% of GDP.

Developing countries tend to have a larger share of small and medium-sized enterprises. SMEs are also responsible for driving innovation and competition in many economic sectors. Although they create more new jobs than large firms, SMEs also suffer the majority of job destruction/contraction.

According to the World Bank Group&#x27;s 2021 FINDEX database, there is a $1.7 trillion funding gap for formal, women-owned micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. Additionally, over 68% of small women-owned firms lack access to finance.

== Overview ==

SMEs are important for economic and social reasons, given the sector&#x27;s role in employment. Due to their size, SMEs are heavily influenced by their Chief Executive Officer, a.k.a. CEOs. The CEOs of SMEs are often the founders, owners, and managers of the SMEs. The duties of the CEO in a SME mirror those of the CEO of a large company: the CEO needs to strategically allocate their time, energy, and assets to direct the SMEs. Typically, the CEO is the strategist, champion and leader for developing the SME or the prime reason for the business failing.

At the employee level, Petrakis and Kostis (2012) explore the role of interpersonal trust and knowledge in the number of small and medium enterprises. They conclude that knowledge positively affects the number of SMEs, which in turn positively affects interpersonal trust. The empirical results indicate that interpersonal trust does not affect the number of SMEs. Therefore, although knowledge development can reinforce SMEs, trust becomes widespread in a society when the number of SMEs is greater.

Medium- or mid-sized enterprises which have grown beyond the scale of a &quot;small business&quot; may have different support needs from those of small businesses, and their contribution to the local and national economy where they operate may also be quite distinct from the contribution of a smaller business.

== By country ==
Multilateral organizations have been criticized for using one measure for all. The legal boundary of SMEs around the world vary, and below is a list of the upper limits of SMEs in some countries.

=== Africa ===
African small businesses frequently struggle to get the cash they require to thrive. According to the SME Finance Forum, the formal financing gap for African SMEs averaged 17% of GDP across the 43 countries assessed in 2017.

According to the World Bank, women own 58% of all MSMEs in Africa.

The European Investment Bank&#x27;s Banking in Africa survey, 2021 suggests that most of the responding banks had a non-performing loan (NPL) ratio of at least 5%. NPLs account for at least 10% of the SME portfolio in approximately one-third of African banks. Furthermore, 50% of the banks had at least 5% of their SME portfolio under the moratorium, and 40% had at least 5% of SME loans under some type of restructuring.

==== Egypt ====
Most of Egypt&#x27;s businesses are small-sized, with 97 percent employing fewer than 10 workers, according to census data released by state-run statistics body CAPMAS (Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics).

Medium-sized enterprises with 10 to 50 employees account for around 2.7 percent of total businesses. However, big businesses with over 50 employees account for 0.4 percent of all enterprises nationwide.

The data is part of Egypt&#x27;s 2012/13 economic census on establishments ranging from small stalls to big enterprises. Economic activity outside the establishments – like street vendors and farmers, for example – were excluded from the census.

The results show that Egypt is greatly lacking in medium-sized businesses.

Seventy percent of the country&#x27;s 24 million businesses have only one or two employees. But less than 0.1 percent – only 784 businesses – employ between 45 and 49 people.

==== Kenya ====
In Kenya, the term changed to MSME, which stands for &quot;micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises&quot;.

For micro-enterprises, the minimum number of employees is up to 10 employees. For small enterprises, it is from 10 to 50. For medium enterprises, it is from 50 to 100.

==== Nigeria ====
The Central Bank of Nigeria defines small and medium enterprises in Nigeria according to asset base and a number of staff employed. The criteria are an asset base that is between ₦5 million ($15,400) to ₦500 million ($1,538,000), and a staff strength that is between 11 and 100 employees.

==== Somalia ====
In Somalia, the term is SME (for &quot;small, medium, and micro enterprises&quot;); elsewhere in Africa, MSME stands for &quot;micro, small, and medium enterprises&quot;. An SME is defined as a small business that has more than 30 employees but less than 250 employees.

==== South Africa ====
In the National Small Business Amendment Act 2004, micro-businesses in the different sectors, varying from the manufacturing to the retail sectors, are defined as businesses with five or fewer employees and a turnover of up to R100,000 ZAR ($6,900). Very small businesses employ between 6 and 20 employees, while small businesses employ between 21 and 50 employees. The upper limit for turnover in a small business varies from R1 million ($69,200) in the agricultural sector to R13 million ($899,800) in the catering, accommodations and other trade sectors as well as in the manufacturing sector, with a maximum of R32 million ($2,214,800) in the wholesale trade sector.

Medium-sized businesses usually employ up to 200 people (100 in the agricultural sector), and the maximum turnover varies from R5 million ($346,100) in the agricultural sector to R51 ($3,529,800) million in the manufacturing sector and R64 ($4,429,600) million in the wholesale trade, commercial agents and allied services sector.

A comprehensive definition of an SME in South Africa is, therefore, an enterprise with one or more of the following characteristics: 
* Fewer than 200 employees,
* Annual turnover of less than R64 million,
* Capital assets of less than R10 million,
* Direct managerial involvement by owners

=== Asia ===
SMEs account for nearly 90% of all company entities in developing Asian countries and are the principal private sector employers, supplying 50-80% of all jobs.

SMEs cover 97-99% of all firms in South-east Asia, contributing considerably to each country&#x27;s GDP—for example, 46% in Singapore, 57% in Indonesia, and over 40% in other nations.

==== Bangladesh ====

In Bangladesh, Bangladesh Bank defines Small and medium enterprises based on fixed assets, employed manpower and yearly turn over, and they are definitely not Public Limited Co. and requires these characteristics:

Key: SE = Small enterprises; ME = Medium enterprises; N/A = Not Applicable; Tk lakhs= × 100,000 Bangladeshi takas
====Hong Kong====
Hong Kong defines Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) as any manufacturing business that employs less than 100 people or any non-manufacturing business that employs less than 50 people.

98% of business establishments in Hong Kong are defined as SMEs and employed 45% of the work force.

==== India ====
India defines Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises based on dual criteria of investment and turnover.
This definition is provided in Section 7 of Micro, Small &amp; Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 (MSMED Act) and was notified in September 2006. The Act provides for the classification of enterprises based on their investment size and the nature of the activity undertaken by that enterprise. As per MSMED Act, enterprises are classified into two categories - manufacturing enterprises and service enterprises. For each of these categories, a definition is given to explain what constitutes a micro-enterprise or a small enterprise or a medium enterprise. If an enterprise does not fall under the above categories, it would be considered a large-scale enterprise.

In June 2020, India updated the definition as follows:
Businesses that are declared as MSMEs and within specific sectors and criteria can then apply for &quot;priority sector&quot; lending to help with business expenses; banks have annual targets set by the Prime Minister&#x27;s Task Force on MSMEs for year-on-year increases of lending to various categories of MSMEs. MSME is considered a key contributor to India&#x27;s growth and contributes 48% to India&#x27;s total export.

In India, one need to apply for Udyam Registration with Government to avail the benefits of MSME.

==== Indonesia ====

In Indonesia, the government defines micro, small, and medium enterprises (Indonesian: &quot;usaha mikro kecil menengah&quot;, UMKM) based on their assets and revenues according to Law No. 20/2008:
An annual revenue of Rp 50 billion is approximately equal to US$3.1 million as of April 2024.

Despite their significant contribution to GDP and job creation, Indonesian MSMEs confront a number of obstacles. One of the most significant is capital access: 60-70 percent of MSMEs lack access to financial institutions and their funding options. Other restrictions include inadequate infrastructure, difficulties acquiring company licences and permissions, high tax rates, political insecurity, and improving their brand image in the digital era.

21st-century businesses strategically use both their websites and social media in order to advertise their products and control their branding. Quality content on both information streams will positively affect branding and attract customers.

The People&#x27;s Business Credit (Kredit Usaha Rakyat, or KUR [&quot;id&quot;]) was established in 2007 by President Yudhoyono to extend credit to businesses that were considered &quot;feasible but not bankable&quot;. Bank Rakyat Indonesia conducts more than half of KUR lending nationwide. In Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, 529 MSMEs with the potential to be funded have been identified by Bank Indonesia.

==== Philippines ====

According to the Department of Trade and Industry&#x27;s 2020 List of Establishments report, there are 957,620 registered business enterprises operating in the country, composed of 99.51% MSMEs and 0.49% large firms. The MSMEs consist of 88.77% microenterprises, 10.25% small enterprises, and 0.49% medium enterprises. Among the top industry sectors include (1) wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles (445,386); (2) accommodation and food service activities (134,046); (3) manufacturing (110,916); (4) other service activities (62,376); and (5) financial and insurance activities (45,558) which accounted for about 83.77% of the total number of MSME establishments. Prior to the pandemic, MSMEs generated more than 5.38 million jobs or 62.66% of the country&#x27;s total employment with a 29.38% share from micro-enterprises followed by 25.78% and 7.50% for small and medium enterprises.

==== Singapore ====

With effect from 1 April 2011, the definition of SMEs is businesses with annual sales turnover of not more than $100 million or employing no more than 200 staff.

=== Europe ===

==== European Union ====

Small companies are important to the European economy as they account for 99.8% of non-financial enterprises in the European Union (EU) and employ two-thirds of the workforce in the EU. The majority of European firms are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), employing over 100 million people. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a large majority of SMEs saw a decline in revenue during 2020-2021.

Medium-sized businesses (or mid-caps) play an important role in the European economy, accounting for a considerable part of employment and wealth production. According to a recent European Commission analysis, mid-cap companies (250-3000 people) make up about 17% of total employment and 21% of turnover in the EU27 business sector.

Micro firms (with fewer than nine employees) employ 38% of the total workforce, while SMEs with fewer than 250 employees account for 34.4%. Larger (XL) firms with 3,000 or more employees account for 10.1% of overall employment in EU business sectors. According to Eurostat SBS statistics, in 2021, tiny enterprises (0-9 workers) and SMEs (excluding micro firms) employed around 30% and 34.5% of the entire workforce in EU27 business sectors, while bigger firms (250+ employees) contributed for 36.4% of overall employment.

The pandemic has had a greater impact on SMEs than on large businesses, with an average sales loss of 26% versus 23% for large businesses. Government assistance appears to have benefited SMEs more than large corporations among the companies that do have overdraft facilities, indicating a successful application of policies to ease financial limitations for SMEs even when they receive help from the banking sector. The EIB Group contributed more than €16.35 billion to small and medium-sized firms in 2022.

SMEs were more quick in altering output during the pandemic, despite the intensity of the shock. In reaction to the crisis, one-third of major enterprises altered their output or services, compared to 37% of SMEs.

Large businesses, on the other hand, embraced digitization to a greater extent than small businesses, with 26% boosting their online distribution of products and services, compared to 22% for SMEs. The most significant difference in adaption measures was shown in the chance of expanding remote work, which increased by 25% among SMEs but 50% among large businesses.

The criteria for defining the size of a business differ from country to country, with many countries having programs of business rate reduction and financial subsidy for SMEs. According to the European Commission, SMEs are enterprises which meet the following definition of staff headcount and either the turnover or balance sheet total definitions:

In July 2011, the European Commission said it would open a consultation on the definition of SMEs in 2012. A consultation document was issued on 6 February 2018 and the consultation period closed on 6 May 2018. , no conclusions or responses have yet emerged.

In Europe, there are three broad parameters that define SMEs:
* Micro-enterprises have up to 10 employees
* Small enterprises have up to 50 employees
* Medium-sized enterprises have up to 250 employees.
The European definition of SME follows: &quot;The category of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is made up of enterprises which employ fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not exceeding 50 million euro, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding 43 million euro.&quot; In order to prepare for an evaluation and revision of some features of the small and medium-sized enterprises definition European Union established public consultation period from 6 February 2018 to 6 May 2018. Public consultation is available for all EU member country citizens and organizations. Especially, national and regional authorities, enterprises, business associations or organizations, venture capital providers, research and academic institutions, and individual citizens are expected as the main contributors.

EU member states have had individual definitions of what constitutes an SME. For example, the definition in Germany had a limit of 255 employees, while in Belgium it could have been 100. The result is that while a Belgian business of 249 employees would be taxed at full rate in Belgium, it would nevertheless be eligible for SME subsidy under a European-labelled programme.

SMEs are a crucial element in the supplier network of large enterprises which are already on their way towards Industry 4.0.
According to German economist Hans-Heinrich Bass, &quot;empirical research on SME as well as policies to promote SME have a long tradition in [West] Germany, dating back into the 19th century. Until the mid-20th century, most researchers considered SME as an impediment to further economic development and SME policies were thus designed in the framework of social policies. Only the Ordoliberalism school, the founding fathers of Germany&#x27;s social market economy, discovered their strengths, considered SME as a solution to mid-20th century economic problems (mass unemployment, abuse of economic power), and laid the foundations for non-selective (functional) industrial policies to promote SMEs.&quot; Only around 20% of European SMEs are substantially digitalized, compared to almost 50% of major businesses. Small and medium-sized companies make up 56.2% of the non-financial sector.

Smaller companies account for more than 60% of the value contributed to the non-financial sector in Belgium, Italy, and Spain, three of the nations worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. An estimated 50% of Europe&#x27;s small firms may fail because they lack the substantial financial reserves required to weather the crisis.

With around 338,000 functioning in Bulgaria in 2022, SMEs and mid-caps are major contributors in the Bulgarian economy. They also employ over 75% of the workforce and create 65% of the economy&#x27;s added value.

The results of an EU survey conducted in 2021 suggest that during the pandemic, in countries with larger fiscal packages, SMEs were on average more likely to experience bankruptcy even after controlling for the size of the shock, the use of bank financing, and country and sector fixed effects. When policy assistance rises by 1% of GDP, the probabilities of bankruptcy for a SME are 2.7 times higher than for a non-SME. Credit limitations are especially difficult for SMEs and new businesses to overcome. Credit constraints affect 24% of SMEs and 27% of young businesses.

Medium-sized firms are ahead of SMEs in terms of digital technology adoption, with performance comparable to that of larger enterprises. Over 84% of XL businesses invested in at least one digital technology, compared to approximately 75% for mid-caps.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020, SMEs in Europe have suffered unprecedented economic instability and turbulence. In 2023, they faced further challenges, including higher input costs, higher borrowing costs and uncertainty.

As a result, the SME value added in the European Union, adjusted for inflation, remains below the pre-crisis level of 2019, and is anticipated to fall further in 2024.

Inflation’s impact is more pronounced for small and medium-sized enterprises, with the probability of increased investment rising by 4.3 percentage points compared to a smaller 1.7 percentage point increase for larger firms, as of 2024. Rising energy costs led to a 5.6 percentage point increase in planned investments in energy efficiency, largely driven by SMEs, increasing from 52.3% to 57.9% in 2022. 

In the European Union, SMEs have played a significant role in advancing the goals of the Green Deal. Many SMEs increased their planned investments in energy efficiency by 5.6% in 2022, from 52.3% to 57.9%. The European Green Deal&#x27;s emphasis on energy efficiency aligned with this trend, helping to drive investments aimed at reducing emissions and energy consumption. 

==== Poland ====
The SME sector in Poland generates almost 50% of the GDP, and out of that, for instance, in 2011, micro companies generated 29.6%, small companies 7.7%, and medium companies 10.4% (big companies 24.0%; other entities 16.5%, and revenues from customs duties and taxes generated 11.9%). In 2011, out of the total of 1,784,603 entities operating in Poland, merely 3,189 were classified as &quot;large&quot;, so 1,781,414 were micro, small, or medium. SMEs employed 6.3 million people out of the total of 9.0 million of labour employed in the private sector. In Poland in 2011 there were 36.2 SMEs per 1,000 inhabitants.

Nearly seven million people are employed by small businesses in Poland, which accounts for around half of the country&#x27;s GDP, yet smaller businesses are less likely than larger ones to invest in strategies to combat climate change or boost energy efficiency. In October 2021, the Bank Ochrony Środowiska, a Polish bank that specializes in funding environmental protection initiatives received €75 million from the European Investment Bank (EIB) for these small enterprises.

The Polish bank wants to use at least 50% of the loan for initiatives with a clear emphasis on tackling climate change, such improving building energy efficiency or turning to renewable energy sources like solar power. The money is set to be distributed across Poland, with around 80% of it projected to go to cohesive regions.

====Slovenia====
Slovenia&#x27;s one-stop-shops for SMEs were recognised by the European Commission in 2008 as a good practice example in making public administration responsive to SME need.

===Outside the EU===

==== Norway ====

In Norway it is normal to describe small and medium-sized businesses as businesses with fewer than 100 employees. Businesses with 1–20 employees are defined as small, while businesses with 21–100 employees are considered medium-sized. A business with more than 100 employees would be considered a large business. &quot;Micro-sized businesses&quot; is a little-used expression in Norway.NHO

Small and medium-sized businesses make up more than 99% of all businesses in Norway, and together they employ 47% of all employees in the private sector. Together, SMEs account for 44% of the economic value added each year: almost 700 billion Norwegian Kroner (NOK).Fakta om små og mellomstore bedrifter (SMB)

==== Switzerland ====

In Switzerland, the Federal Statistical Office defines small and medium-sized enterprises as companies with less than 250 employees. The categories are the following:
* Microentreprises: 1 to 9 employees
* Small enterprises: 10 to 49 employees
* Medium-sized enterprises: 50 to 249 employees
* Large enterprises: 250 employees or more
==== United Kingdom ====
In the United Kingdom (UK), a company is defined as being an SME if it meets two out of three criteria: it has a turnover of less than £25m, it has fewer than 250 employees, it has gross assets of less than £12.5m. Very small companies are called in the UK micro-entities, which have simpler financial reporting requirements. Such micro-enterprises must meet any two of the following criteria: balance sheet £316,000 or less; turnover £632,000 or less; employees 10 or less.

Many small and medium-sized businesses form part of the UK&#x27;s currently growing , or &quot;Brittelstand&quot; as it is also sometimes named. These are businesses in Britain that are not only small or medium but also have a much broader set of values and more elastic definition.

The Department for Business Innovation and Skills estimated that at the start of 2014, 99.3% of UK private sector businesses were SMEs, with their £1.6 trillion annual turnover accounting for 47% of private sector turnover.

In order to support SMEs, the UK government set a target in 2010 &quot;that 25% of government’s spend, either directly or in supply chains, goes to SMEs by 2015&quot;; it achieved this by 2013.

=== North America ===

==== Canada ====
Industry Canada defines a small business as one with fewer than 100 paid employees, and a medium-sized business as one with at least 100 and fewer than 500 employees. As of December 2012, there were 1,107,540 employer businesses in Canada of the rally . Canadian controlled private corporations receive a 17% reduction in the tax rate on taxable income from active businesses up to $500,000. This small business deduction is reduced for corporations whose taxable capital exceeds $10M and is eliminated for corporations whose taxable capital exceeds $15M. It has been estimated that almost $2 trillion of Canadian SMEs will be coming up for sale over the next decade, which is twice as large as the assets of the top 1,000 Canadian pension plans and approximately the same size as Canadian annual GDP.

==== Mexico ====
The small and medium-sized companies in Mexico are called PYMEs, which is a direct translation of SMEs. There is also another categorization in the country called MiPyMEs. The MiPyMEs are micro, small and medium-sized businesses, with an emphasis on micro which are one man companies or a type of freelance.

==== United States ====
In the United States, the Small Business Administration sets small business criteria based on industry, ownership structure, revenue and number of employees (which in some circumstances may be as high as 1500, although the cap is typically 500).
Both the US and the EU generally use the same threshold of fewer than 10 employees for small offices (SOHO).

=== Oceania ===

==== Australia ====

In Australia, a SME has 200 or fewer employees. Micro Businesses have 1–4 employees, small businesses 5–19, medium businesses 20–199, and large businesses 200+. Australian SMEs make up 98% of all Australian businesses, produce one-third of total GDP, and employ 4.7 million people. SMEs represent 90 percent of all goods exporters and over 60% of services exporters.

==== New Zealand ====
In New Zealand, 99% of businesses employ 50 or less staff, and the official definition of a small business is one with 19 or fewer employees. It is estimated that approximately 28% of New Zealand&#x27;s gross domestic product is produced by companies with fewer than 20 employees.

<doc id="426335" wikidata="Q296796" url="?curid=426335" title="Dino De Laurentiis">
<text>Agostino &quot;Dino&quot; De Laurentiis (; 8 August 1919 – 10 November 2010) was an Italian film producer and businessman who held both Italian and American citizenship. Following a brief acting career in the late 1930s and early 1940s, he moved into film production; alongside Carlo Ponti, he brought Italian cinema to the international scene in the post-World War II period. He produced or co-produced over 500 films, with 38 of his Hollywood films receiving Academy Award nominations. He was also the creator and operator of DDL Foodshow, a chain of Italian specialty foods stores.

==Early life==
Agostino De Laurentiis was born in Torre Annunziata, Kingdom of Italy, on 8 August 1919. He grew up selling spaghetti made by his father&#x27;s pasta factory. His older brother, Luigi De Laurentiis (1917–1992), later followed him into film production. He studied at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in 1937 and 1938, but his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II.

==Career==
===Film production===
De Laurentiis produced his first film, &quot;L&#x27;ultimo Combattimento&quot;, in 1941. His company, the Dino de Laurentiis Cinematografica, moved into film production in 1946. In the early years, De Laurentiis produced Italian neorealist films such as &quot;Bitter Rice&quot; (1949) and the early Fellini works &quot;La Strada&quot; (1954) and &quot;Nights of Cabiria&quot; (1956), often in collaboration with producer Carlo Ponti. 

In the 1960s, De Laurentiis built his own studio facilities. He produced such films as &quot;Barabbas&quot; (1961), a Christian religious epic; &quot;The Bible: In the Beginning...&quot; (1966); an imitation James Bond film; &quot;Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die&quot;, &quot;Navajo Joe&quot; (1966), a spaghetti Western; &quot;Anzio&quot; (1968), a World War II film; &quot;Barbarella&quot; (1968) and &quot;&quot; (1968), both successful comic book adaptations; and &quot;The Valachi Papers&quot; (1972), released before its originally scheduled date in order to capitalize on the popularity of &quot;The Godfather&quot;. 

In 1973, De Laurentiis relocated his headquarters to New York and he was reportedly considering to produce an American television series. His studio financially collapsed during the 1970s. In the 1980s, he had his own studio: De Laurentiis Entertainment Group (DEG) based in Wilmington, North Carolina. The studio made Wilmington an unexpected center of film and television production. In 1990, he obtained backing from an Italian friend and formed another company: Dino De Laurentiis Communications in Beverly Hills.

De Laurentiis produced a number of successful films, including &quot;The Scientific Cardplayer&quot; (1972), &quot;Serpico&quot; (1973), &quot;Death Wish&quot; (1974), &quot;Mandingo&quot; (1975), &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; (1975), &quot;The Shootist&quot; (1976), &quot;Drum&quot; (1976), Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;The Serpent&#x27;s Egg&quot; (1977), &quot;Ragtime&quot; (1981), &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; (1982), &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986) and &quot;Breakdown&quot; (1997). De Laurentiis&#x27; name became well known through the 1976 &quot;King Kong&quot; remake, which was a commercial hit; &quot;Lipstick&quot; (1976), a rape and revenge drama; &quot;Orca&quot; (1977), a killer whale film; &quot;The White Buffalo&quot; (1977), a western; the disaster movie &quot;Hurricane&quot; (1979); the remake of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1980); David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; (1984); &quot;The Bounty&quot; (1984); and &quot;King Kong Lives&quot; (1986). 

De Laurentiis produced several adaptations of Stephen King works, including &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; (1983), &quot;Cat&#x27;s Eye&quot; (1985), &quot;Silver Bullet&quot; (1985), and &quot;Maximum Overdrive&quot; (1986). De Laurentiis&#x27; company was involved with the horror sequels &quot;Halloween II&quot; (1981), &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; (1987), and &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; (1992). De Laurentiis also produced the first Hannibal Lecter film, &quot;Manhunter&quot; (1986), an adaptation of the Thomas Harris novel &quot;Red Dragon&quot;. He passed on adapting the novels&#x27; sequel, &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991), but produced the two follow-ups, &quot;Hannibal&quot; (2001) and &quot;Red Dragon&quot; (2002), a re-adaptation of the novel. He also produced the prequel &quot;Hannibal Rising&quot; (2007), which tells the story of how Hannibal becomes a serial killer.

===DDL Foodshow===
DDL Foodshow was an Italian specialty foods store with three locations: two in New York City and one in Beverly Hills. They were opened in the mid-1980s, and were owned and operated by De Laurentiis.

The first store was opened in the restored palm court in the ornate lobby of the historic Endicott Hotel, now a co-op on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side, near the existing Zabar&#x27;s food emporium on Broadway. The first NYC store opened in November 1982, and it was reported that the store &quot;opened to crowds of 30,000 over the Thanksgiving weekend, when de Laurentiis himself greeted customers at the door&quot;. The store&#x27;s assistant manager said that &quot;it was like the premiere of a movie&quot;.

The food critic Gael Greene wrote a scathing review on the opening in &quot;New York&quot;. In an interview with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; a month later, she admitted that the store was &quot;probably the most stunningly handsome grocery in the world, certainly in New York&quot;, but &quot;the pricing was insane. They hadn&#x27;t paid enough attention to the competition.&quot; She reported that she&#x27;d talked to De Laurentiis: &quot;Dino&#x27;s reaction was that I&#x27;m full of it. And we&#x27;re meeting over a bowl of pasta to discuss it.&quot; A review in &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; said that it was &quot;worth a peek and a purchase&quot;.

DDL Foodshow was later considered to be a forebear of the new Italian specialty goods food-store restaurant dining attraction Eataly.

==Personal life==
De Laurentiis&#x27; brief first marriage in Italy was annulled.

In 1949, De Laurentiis married Italian-British actress Silvana Mangano, with whom he had four children: Veronica, an author and actress; Raffaella, a fellow film producer; Federico, also a film producer who died in a plane crash in 1981; and Francesca. His granddaughter through Veronica is chef Giada De Laurentiis, while his nephew through his brother Luigi is fellow film producer Aurelio De Laurentiis. He and Mangano divorced in 1988, and she died of lung cancer the following year.

Having lived in the U.S. since 1976, De Laurentiis became an American citizen in 1986. 

In 1990, De Laurentiis married American producer Martha Schumacher, who had produced many of his films since 1985. They had two daughters named Carolyna and Dina and remained married until his death in 2010. Schumacher died of cancer in 2021.

==Death==
On 10 November 2010, at the age of 91, De Laurentiis died at his home in Beverly Hills, California.

==Awards and recognitions==
In 1957, De Laurentiis and Carlo Ponti won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for producing &quot;La Strada&quot; (1954). This was a unique occasion when the producers&#x27; names were included in the nominations, and they, not the director Federico Fellini, received the award.

In 2001, De Laurentiis received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

In 2012, he was posthumously honored with the America Award by the Italy–USA Foundation.

<text>Simon Harcourt, 1st Earl Harcourt, (1714 – 16 September 1777), known as Viscount Harcourt between 1727 and 1749, was a British diplomat and general who became Viceroy of Ireland.

==Biography==
Harcourt was born in Oxfordshire, the son of Hon. Simon Harcourt, M.P. for Wallingford and Abingdon, and Elizabeth Evelyn, sister of Sir John Evelyn, 1st Baronet. His father died in 1720, when Simon was still a small child. He was educated at Westminster School and in 1727 succeeded his grandfather Simon Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt as 2nd Viscount Harcourt. In 1745, having raised a regiment for service during the Jacobite Rebellion, the 76th Foot (Lord Harcourts Regiment), he received a commission as a colonel in the army. The regiment was disbanded on 10 June 1746.

In 1749, he was created Earl Harcourt of Stanton Harcourt. He was appointed governor to the prince of Wales, afterward George III, in 1751; and after the accession of the latter to the throne, in 1761, he was appointed as special ambassador to Mecklenburg-Strelitz, to negotiate a marriage between King George and Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (Princess Charlotte), whom he conducted to England.

He held a number of appointments at court and in the diplomatic service. He was the British ambassador to Paris from 1768 to 1772. He was promoted to the rank of general in 1772; and in October of the same year he succeeded Lord Townshend as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, an office which he held until 1777. His proposal to impose a tax of 10% on the rents of absentee landlords had to be abandoned owing to opposition in England; but he succeeded in conciliating the leaders of Opposition in Ireland, and he persuaded Henry Flood to accept office in the government. Resigning in January 1777, he retired to Nuneham Park. He died there shortly afterwards by accidentally drowning in a well while trying to rescue his favourite dog, which had fallen into the well while the pair had been out for a walk. He succeeded in rescuing the dog despite losing his life; several hours after going missing, Harcourt was found head first down the well with only his lower legs and feet visible above the water and the dog sitting on his feet.

==Personal life==
He married, on 16 October 1735, Rebecca Samborne Le Bass (died 16 January 1765), daughter and heiress of Charles Samborne Le Bass, of Pipewell Abbey, Northamptonshire. They had two sons and two daughters:

*George Simon Harcourt, 2nd Earl Harcourt (1 August 1736 – 20 April 1809), married on 26 September 1765 his first cousin the Hon. Elizabeth Venables-Vernon (21 January 1746 – 25 January 1826), daughter of George Venables-Vernon, 1st Baron Vernon and Martha Harcourt, without issue.
*Lady Elizabeth Harcourt (18 June 1739 – 21 January 1811), married on 20 June 1763 Sir William Lee, 4th Baronet, of Hartwell (12 September 1726 – 6 July 1799)
*Hon. Anne Harcourt (June 1741 – August 1746)
*William Harcourt, 3rd Earl Harcourt (20 March 1743 – 17 June 1830), upon whose death without male issue the family titles became extinct.

<text>Wesley Branch Rickey (December 20, 1881 – December 9, 1965) was an American baseball player and sports executive. Rickey was instrumental in breaking Major League Baseball&#x27;s color barrier by signing black player Jackie Robinson. He also created the framework for the modern minor league farm system, encouraged the major leagues to add new teams through his involvement in the proposed Continental League, and introduced the batting helmet. He was posthumously elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1967.

Rickey played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Browns and New York Highlanders from 1905 through 1907. After struggling as a player, Rickey returned to college, where he learned about administration from Philip Bartelme. Returning to the major leagues in 1913, Rickey embarked on a successful managing and executive career with the St. Louis Browns, St. Louis Cardinals, Brooklyn Dodgers and Pittsburgh Pirates. The Cardinals elected him to their team Hall of Fame in 2014.

Rickey also had a career in football, as a player for the professional Shelby Blues and as a coach at Ohio Wesleyan University and Allegheny College. He received the nickname &quot;Mahatma&quot; after sportswriter Tom Meany read an article describing Mahatma Gandhi as a combination of &quot;your father and Tammany Hall.&quot;

==Early life==
Wesley Branch Rickey was born on December 20, 1881, in Portsmouth, Ohio, the son of Jacob Frank Rickey and Emily (née Brown). Rickey was the uncle of Beth Rickey, a Louisiana political activist. He graduated from Valley High School in Lucasville, Ohio, in 1899.

==College career==
Rickey was a catcher on the baseball team at Ohio Wesleyan University, where he obtained his B.A. Rickey was a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.

Rickey attended the University of Michigan, where he received his LL.B.

While at Michigan, Rickey applied for the job as Michigan&#x27;s baseball coach. Rickey asked every alumnus he had ever met to write letters to Philip Bartelme, the school&#x27;s athletic director, on his behalf. Bartelme recalled, &quot;Day after day those letters came in.&quot; Bartelme was reportedly impressed with Rickey&#x27;s passion for baseball and his idealism about the proper role of athletics on a college campus. Bartelme convinced the dean of the law school that Rickey could handle his law studies while serving as the school&#x27;s baseball coach. Bartelme reportedly called Rickey into his office to tell him he had the job if only &quot;to put a stop to those damn letters that come in every day.&quot; The hiring also marked the beginning of a lifelong friendship and business relationship between Rickey and Bartelme. Bartelme and Rickey worked together for most of the next 35 years, and in 1944 a California newspaper noted: &quot;He and Rickey have had a close association in baseball ever since Bartelme was head of the athletic department of the University of Michigan where Rickey took to baseball just as a means to build up his failing health.&quot;

During his four years as head baseball coach from 1910 to 1913, Rickey&#x27;s record was 68–32–4. In his final season, the Michigan squad — led by brilliant sophomore first baseman and left-handed pitcher George Sisler, who batted .445 — compiled a 21–4–1 won-lost record, a winning percentage of .827.

Rickey was a Freemason, first at Lucasville Lodge #465 in Ohio, then at Tuscan Lodge #360 in St. Louis. After arriving in Brooklyn, Rickey joined Montauk Masonic Lodge #286 in Brooklyn.

Stricken with tuberculosis, he sought treatment in Saranac Lake, New York in 1908 and 1909 at the Trudeau Sanatorium. Later, he moved into the Jacob Schiff cottage.

==Professional football career==
Before his front office days, Rickey played both football and baseball professionally.

In 1902, Rickey played professional football for the Shelby Blues of the &quot;Ohio League&quot;, the direct predecessor to the modern National Football League (NFL.) Rickey often played for pay with Shelby while he was attending Ohio Wesleyan. During his time with Shelby, Rickey became friends with his teammate Charles Follis, who was the first black professional football player. He also played against him on October 17, 1903, when Follis ran for a 70-yard touchdown against the Ohio Wesleyan football team. After that game Rickey praised Follis, calling him &quot;a wonder.&quot; It is also possible that Follis&#x27; poise and class under the pressures of such racial tension, as well as his exceptional play in spite of it, inspired Rickey to sign Jackie Robinson decades later. Rickey, however, stated his inspiration for bringing Jackie Robinson into baseball was the ill-treatment he saw received by his black catcher Charles Thomas on the Ohio Wesleyan baseball team coached by Rickey in 1903 and 1904 and the gentlemanly way Thomas handled it. When Rickey signed Robinson, Charles Thomas&#x27; story was made known in the papers

==Professional baseball career==
===Minor leagues===

In 1903, Rickey signed a contract with the Terre Haute Hottentots of the Class B Central League, making his professional debut on June 20. Rickey was assigned to the Le Mars Blackbirds of the Class D Iowa–South Dakota League. During this period, Rickey also spent two seasons–1904 and 1905—coaching baseball, basketball and football at Allegheny College in Pennsylvania where he also served as athletic director and as an instructor of Shakespeare, English, and freshman history.

===St. Louis Browns (1905–1906)===
A left-handed-batting catcher, he played in both baseball&#x27;s minor and major leagues. Rickey debuted in the major leagues with the St. Louis Browns in 1905.

===New York Highlanders (1907)===
Sold to the New York Highlanders in 1907, Rickey could neither hit nor field while with the club, and his batting average dropped below .200. One opposing team stole 13 bases in one game while Rickey was behind the plate, which was an American League record until 1911. Rickey also injured his throwing arm and retired as a player following that season.

==Managerial and executive career==
===St. Louis Browns (1913–1916)===
Rickey was in his third year as the Wolverines&#x27; baseball coach when St. Louis Browns owner Robert Hedges rewarmed their relationship. Hedges inquired if Rickey were interested in running the minor-league Kansas City Blues, which he was thinking of purchasing. Citing his commitment to Michigan, Rickey turned Hedges down, but he agreed to do some part-time scouting for the Browns in the West during the summer of 1912. That September, a persistent Hedges presented Rickey with a new opportunity: to become his top assistant and business manager of the MLB Browns themselves, at a substantial salary increase, effective after Michigan&#x27;s 1913 baseball season. This time Rickey agreed to terms, and his career as a professional baseball executive was launched at age 31 on June 1, 1913. After three months in the Browns&#x27; front office, on September 17, 1913, Rickey was also appointed field manager, replacing incumbent George Stovall and adding those responsibilities to his existing duties. Veteran players Jimmy Austin and, later, Burt Shotton became Rickey&#x27;s &quot;Sunday managers&quot;, running the Browns on the Sabbath in the young pilot&#x27;s absence.

The Browns, in the midst of one of several low points during their 52-year history, were 52–90 and in last place at the time. Rickey steered them to a 5–6–1 record over the last 12 games of their season. Then, in , with Rickey in charge from the first day of spring training, they improved by 14 games, jumping from eighth to fifth place in the American League. However, the Browns took a giant step backwards; despite the June signing of the player who would become one of the greatest in franchise history—future Hall of Famer Sisler—they went only 63–91, 8½ games poorer than the 1914 edition.

The team&#x27;s on-field struggles notwithstanding, Rickey maintained Hedges&#x27; confidence. But during the 1915–1916 offseason, as part of the settlement of the Federal League &quot;war&quot;, Hedges sold the Browns to the former operator of the Feds&#x27; St. Louis entry, Philip DeCatesby Ball. The new owner brought along his own manager, Fielder Jones, and restricted an unhappy Rickey to front-office duties. Compounding matters, the men&#x27;s personalities clashed, and as the 1916 season concluded, Rickey began searching for other employment.

===St. Louis Cardinals (1917–1942)===

====Early years and World War I service (1917–1918)====
Coincidentally, the National League&#x27;s St. Louis Cardinals were also enduring a period of ownership turmoil. In 1916, they had finished eighth and last in the Senior Circuit and attracted a league-worst 224,308 fans to Robison Field, and their owner, Helene Hathaway Britton, put them up for sale. A local consortium of businessmen, including automobile dealer Sam Breadon, quickly formed to buy the financially strapped team and keep it from moving elsewhere. Searching for a chief executive, they reached out to seven St. Louis sportswriters and asked for recommendations; all seven separately suggested Rickey.

But, before he could join the Cardinals, Rickey had to sort out his existing obligations to Ball and the Browns. American League president and founder Ban Johnson, determined to keep Rickey in his league, pressured Ball to seek a temporary injunction to enforce the terms of Rickey&#x27;s contract. The dispute was resolved in April 1917, when Rickey was permitted to assume his duties as the Cardinals&#x27; club president and business manager; he also purchased a small share of the team. Apart from his year as president of the Continental League in 1959–1960, Rickey would spend the remainder of his baseball career in the National League.

Each of Rickey&#x27;s first two seasons with the Cardinals would be overshadowed by the United States&#x27; entry into World War I, on April 6, 1917.

Despite their last-place standing in 1916, Rickey inherited two Hall-of-Fame assets: 21-year-old infielder Rogers Hornsby and the Cardinals&#x27; manager, Miller Huggins. Each contributed to a strong bounce-back season in 1917: Hornsby batted .327 in 145 games and led the team in hits, and Huggins guided the Cardinals to 82 wins and a third-place finish. During the 1920s, Hornsby would become the cornerstone of the franchise as it became a National League pennant contender. But Huggins, who had been a member of a rival ownership group that lost its bid for the Cardinals to Breadon&#x27;s syndicate, departed for the New York Yankees at season&#x27;s end; there he would lead an eventual American League and MLB powerhouse as a consolation prize for Ban Johnson&#x27;s circuit.

The war-disrupted 1918 campaign saw the Cardinals, managed by veteran minor-league pilot Jack Hendricks, perform poorly. They plummeted to last place in the National League, winning only 51 of 131 games during the shortened regular season, which ended September 2. Rickey, however, had by that point already enlisted as an officer in the United States Army, wearing a military uniform to work at the Cardinals&#x27; front office before reporting for duty in Washington. His leave of absence, or temporary resignation, from the team began August 31, 1918.

He embarked by steamship for France and the Western Front in mid-September. Recovering from a bout of pneumonia contracted aboard ship, Rickey commanded a training unit of the Chemical Warfare Service that included Ty Cobb and Christy Mathewson. His unit saw action as part of the First Gas Regiment. After the November 11, 1918, armistice ended hostilities, Rickey returned to the United States on December 23 and, when he resumed his duties with the Cardinals, he succeeded Hendricks as field manager for 1919.

====Field manager (1919–1925)====
Rickey&#x27;s record as manager of the Cardinals for six full years, and part of a seventh, was relatively mediocre (458–485–4, .486). They did improve from only 53 victories in 1919 to 75 in 1920. Then they posted winning marks from 1921 to 1923. In 1920, the ownership of the team stabilized when Sam Breadon purchased controlling interest and took over, from Rickey, as club president.

On the field, the club was led by second baseman Hornsby, who batted over .400 three times (and .397 once). Others—such as Jack Fournier, Jesse Haines, Austin McHenry and Jack Smith—also contributed to the team&#x27;s surge. But McHenry&#x27;s tragic death from a brain tumor in 1922 was a difficult blow for the Cardinals to absorb. They fell from 87 to 85 to 79 wins over the 1921–1923 period; then, in 1924, they dropped below .500 and finished 76–78.

Off the field, Rickey and Breadon pursued the farm system concept. By 1923, the Cardinals had ownership stakes or affiliations with five minor-league teams, including top-level Syracuse, Class A Houston, and Class C Fort Smith; the Detroit Tigers were the only other major-league club with as much as a single &quot;farm team.&quot; At the MLB level, sophomore Jim Bottomley, a future Hall of Famer, took over the Cardinals&#x27; first base job and batted .371 with 194 hits. Twenty-year-old Ohio Wesleyan graduate Howard Freigau started 81 games at shortstop, and outfielders Ray Blades and Heinie Mueller became key contributors. The rosters of Rickey&#x27;s farm teams in 1923 included another future Hall of Famer, Chick Hafey, as well as future 1920s Cardinal standouts Les Bell, Taylor Douthit, Fred Frankhouse and Wattie Holm.

But while perfecting the process of player development was his most important achievement of the time, Rickey also contributed to the sartorial appearance of the Cardinals. For the first time, they wore uniforms that featured the two distinctive cardinal birds perched on a baseball bat over the name &quot;Cardinals&quot; with the letter &quot;C&quot; of the word hooked over the bat in 1922. The concept of this pattern originated in a Presbyterian church in Ferguson, Missouri, at which Rickey was speaking. He noticed a colorful cardboard arrangement featuring two cardinal birds perched on a branch on a table. The arrangement&#x27;s designer was a woman named Allie May Schmidt. Schmidt&#x27;s father, a graphic designer, assisted Rickey in creating the logo that is part of a familiar staple on Cardinals uniforms.

In 1923, Rickey also experimented with placing uniform numbers on the sleeves of his players to help fans identify them. The practice was abandoned after only one season, but putting numbers on the backs of uniform shirts became widespread during the 1930s.

====Business/general manager (1925–1942)====
When the Cardinals&#x27; 1925 season began poorly, Breadon fired Rickey from his manager&#x27;s post on May 30. At 13–25, the club was in last place in the National League, 13 games out of the lead. Hornsby was named player–manager to succeed him. Aged 43 at the time of his firing, Rickey had been a player, manager and executive in the Major Leagues, and there had been little indication to this point that he would ever belong in a baseball hall of fame.

However, Breadon could not deny Rickey&#x27;s acumen for player development, and asked him to stay to run the front office. An embittered Rickey stated, &quot;You can&#x27;t do this to me, Sam. You are ruining me.&quot; &quot;No.&quot; Breadon responded, &quot;I am doing you the greatest favor one man has ever done to another.&quot;

Although he was not the first executive titled as a &quot;general manager&quot; in Major League Baseball history — his actual title was &quot;business manager&quot; — through his activities, including inventing and building the farm system, Rickey came to embody the position of the baseball operations executive who mastered roster construction, scouting, player acquisition and development, and business affairs, came to define the responsibilities of a 20th-century GM. In the quarter century between 1926 and 1950, Rickey&#x27;s Cardinals and Dodgers teams would win eight National League titles during his stewardship; the teams he left behind would win six more pennants within five years immediately after his departure from their front offices.

Meanwhile, in 1926, his first full year as manager, Hornsby led the Cardinals to their first World Series championship.

=====Development of the farm system=====
Two more pennants followed in and , although each team fell to its American League foe in the World Series. By , Rickey&#x27;s Cardinals were the class of the National League. They won 101 games in 1931 and won the World Series in seven games over the defending champion Philadelphia Athletics. The star of the 1931 World Series was rookie Pepper Martin, a 1928 graduate of Rickey&#x27;s player development system. With eight owned or affiliated farm teams by 1931, the system was fed by the Cardinals&#x27; scouting corps, headed by Charley Barrett (1871–1939), who introduced tryout camps to identify young amateur talent across the U.S. to fill the pipeline. Soon, other organization graduates joined the team, among them future Hall of Famers Dizzy Dean and Joe Medwick, nicknamed &quot;Ducky&quot;, and Dean&#x27;s brother Paul &quot;Daffy&quot; Dean. The Deans and Medwick were integral parts of the Redbirds, known as the &quot;Gashouse Gang&quot;, who won the franchise&#x27;s third World Series title.

Despite the ravages of The Great Depression, the Cardinal farm system continued to expand during the 1930s, with 21 teams by , 28 in , and 33 in . Kenesaw Mountain Landis, the Commissioner of Baseball, was concerned that Rickey&#x27;s minor league system was going to ruin baseball by destroying existing minor league teams, and he twice released over 70 Cardinal minor leaguers. Despite Landis&#x27; efforts, Rickey&#x27;s minor league system continued to thrive, and similar systems were adopted by every major league team within a few years. Arguably, the farm system &quot;saved&quot; the minor leagues, by keeping them &quot;necessary&quot; after the television age began and minor league attendance figures declined.

Rickey continued to develop the Cardinals up until the early 1940s. In his final year at St. Louis, 1942, the Cardinals had their best season in franchise history, winning 106 games and the World Series title. The team was led by a new crop of players developed by the Cardinals, two of whom, Enos Slaughter and Stan Musial, became Hall of Famers; and several others, among them future MVP Marty Marion, who were among the best at their position during their eras. Even their manager Billy Southworth was a product of their farm system.

===Brooklyn Dodgers (1943–1950)===

When Rickey&#x27;s good friend Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Larry MacPhail enlisted in the army to serve in World War II after the 1942 season, the Dodgers hired Rickey to replace him as president and general manager, ending a tenure of over two decades with the Cardinals. In 1945, the Dodger ownership reorganized, with Rickey acquiring 25% of Dodger stock to become an equal partner with three other owners.

====Further innovations====
Rickey continued to innovate in his time with Brooklyn. He was responsible for the first full-time spring training facility, in Vero Beach, Florida, and encouraged the use of now-commonplace tools such as the batting cage, pitching machines, and batting helmets. He also pioneered the use of statistical analysis in baseball (what is now known as sabermetrics), when he hired statistician Allan Roth as a full-time analyst for the Dodgers in 1947. After viewing Roth&#x27;s evidence, Rickey promoted the idea that on-base percentage was a more important hitting statistic than batting average. While working under Rickey, Roth was also the first person to provide statistical evidence that platoon effects were real and quantifiable.

====Breaking the color barrier====
Rickey&#x27;s most memorable act with the Dodgers involved signing Jackie Robinson, thus breaking baseball&#x27;s color barrier, which had been an unwritten rule since the 1880s. This policy had continued under a succession of baseball leaders, including Landis, who was openly opposed to integrating Major League Baseball for what he regarded as legitimate reasons. Landis died in 1944, but Rickey had already set the process in motion, having sought (and gained) approval from the Dodgers Board of Directors in 1943 to begin the search for &quot;the right man.&quot;

In early 1945, Rickey was anticipating the integration of black players into Major League Baseball. Rickey, along with Gus Greenlee who was the owner of the original Pittsburgh Crawfords, created the United States League (USL) as a method to scout black players specifically to break the color line. It is unclear if the league actually played the 1945 season or if it was only used as a pretense for integration. Around this time, Rickey held tryouts of black players, under the cover story of forming a new team in the USL called the &quot;Brooklyn Brown Dodgers.&quot; The Dodgers were, in fact, looking for the right man to break the color line.

On August 28, 1945, Rickey signed Robinson, who never played in the USL, to a minor league contract. Robinson had been playing in the Negro leagues for the Kansas City Monarchs. On October 23, 1945, it was announced that Robinson would join the Montreal Royals, the Dodgers&#x27; International League affiliate, for the 1946 season. He would end up as the league&#x27;s batting champion, and led the Royals to a dominant league championship.

There was no statute officially banning blacks from baseball, only a universally recognized unwritten rule which no club owner was prepared to break that was perpetuated by culturally entrenched racism and a desire by club owners to be perceived as representing the values and beliefs of everyday American white men. The service of black Americans in the Second World War, and the celebrated pre-war achievements of black athletes in American sports, such as Joe Louis in boxing and Jesse Owens in track, helped pave the way for the cultural shift necessary to break the barrier.

Rickey knew that Robinson would face racism and discrimination. Rickey made it clear in their momentous first meeting that he anticipated wide-scale resistance both inside and outside baseball to opening its doors to black players. As predicted by Rickey, right from the start Robinson faced obstacles among his teammates and other teams&#x27; players. No matter how harsh the white people were towards Robinson, he could not retaliate. Robinson had agreed with Rickey not to lose his temper and jeopardize the chances of all the blacks who would follow him if he could help break down the barriers.

Red Barber recounted in Ken Burns&#x27;s documentary &quot;Baseball&quot; that Rickey&#x27;s determination to desegregate Major League Baseball was born out of a combination of idealism and astute business sense. The idealism was at least partially rooted in an incident involving a team for which Rickey worked early on. While managing at Ohio Wesleyan University, a black player, Charles Thomas, was extremely upset at being refused accommodation, because of his race, at the hotel where the team stayed. Though an infuriated Rickey managed to get him into the hotel for the night, he never forgot the incident and later said, &quot;I may not be able to do something about racism in every field, but I can sure do something about it in baseball.&quot; The business element was based on the fact that the Negro leagues had numerous star athletes, and logically, the first Major League team to hire them would get the first pick of the players at an attractive price. At the time, Mexican brewery czar Jorge Pasquel was raiding America for black talent (e.g. Satchel Paige), as well as disgruntled white players, for the Mexican League with the idea of creating an integrated league that could compete on a talent level with the U.S. major leagues. However idealistic, Rickey did not compensate Monarchs ownership for the rights to obtain Robinson, nor did he pay for rights to Don Newcombe, who would also join the Dodgers from a Negro leagues club. Rickey also attempted to sign Monte Irvin but Newark Eagles business owner Effa Manley refused to allow Irvin to leave her club without compensation. When she threatened to sue him in court, Rickey stopped the pursuit of Irvin, who would later sign with the New York Giants.

Amid much fanfare, Jackie debuted, and turned out to be a success. Robinson was baseball&#x27;s first rookie of the year, and while he was often jeered by opposing baseball players, managers, and fans, he became extremely popular with the American public. His success became the crowning achievement of Rickey&#x27;s illustrious career. His Dodgers would make the World Series that year. Although they lost in seven games to the New York Yankees, Rickey&#x27;s vision and action had set the stage for the Dodgers to be contenders for decades to come. And it opened the door for other leaders like Larry Doby of the Cleveland Indians, who integrated the American League in 1947, as well.

====Later career with Dodgers====
From 1945 through 1950, Rickey was one of four owners of the Dodgers, each with one quarter of the franchise. When one of the four (John L. Smith) died, Walter O&#x27;Malley took control of that quarter. Also in 1950, Branch Rickey&#x27;s contract as Dodger president expired, and Walter O&#x27;Malley decided that were Rickey to retain the job, almost all of Rickey&#x27;s power would be gone; for example, he would no longer take a percentage of every franchise sale. Rickey declined a new contract as president. Then, to be a majority owner, O&#x27;Malley offered to buy Rickey&#x27;s portion. Seeing no reason to hold on to the club, Rickey decided to comply. In a final act of retaliation against O&#x27;Malley, Rickey instead offered the club percentage to a friend for $1 million. His chances at complete franchise control at risk, O&#x27;Malley was forced to offer more money, and Rickey finally sold his portion for $1.05 million (equivalent to approximately $ in ).

===Pittsburgh Pirates (1951–1955)===
Immediately upon leaving the Dodgers, Rickey was offered the position of executive vice president and general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates by the team&#x27;s new majority owner, John W. Galbreath. He joined them on November 1, 1950, one month after the 1950 Bucs, who lost 96 out of 153 games, finished in last place for only the third time in the 20th century. With an average player age of 28.6 years, they also were one of the oldest teams in the National League. Bringing several key aides with him from Brooklyn, Rickey began a tear-down/re-building process that would consume his entire five-year term as general manager. The Pirates finished eighth (and last) four times and seventh once, compiled a miserable 269–501 (.349) record, and in 1952 posted a dismal 42–112 record, lagging behind the champion Dodgers by 54 games. It was the second-worst season in franchise history, and the fourth-worst in modern (post-1900) baseball history. After presiding over one last-place season with the Pirates, Rickey proposed cutting the pay of power-hitting superstar Ralph Kiner. When Kiner objected, Rickey famously quipped, &quot;Son, we could have finished last without you!&quot;

Perhaps his most notable innovation during his Pittsburgh tenure came during the season, when the Pirates became the first team to permanently adopt batting helmets on both offense and defense. These helmets resembled a primitive fiberglass &quot;miner&#x27;s cap&quot;. This was the mandate of Rickey, who also owned stock in the company producing the helmets. Under Rickey&#x27;s orders, all Pirate players had to wear the helmets both at bat and in the field. The helmets became a permanent feature for all Pirate hitters, but within a few weeks the team began to abandon their use of helmets on defense, partly because of their awkwardly heavy feel. Once the Pirates discarded the helmets on defense, the trend disappeared from the game.

Health problems forced Rickey to retire in 1955. The Pirates were still mired in the NL basement; they would not have another winning record until 1958. However, with an average age of 25.5, they were the youngest outfit in the Senior Circuit in 1955. Five years later, Rickey&#x27;s contributions would help lead to a World Series championship for Pittsburgh in 1960. Wrote author Andrew O&#x27;Toole in 2000, &quot;The core of the 1960 championship team [notably Roberto Clemente, Dick Groat, Bill Mazeroski, Elroy Face and Vern Law, among others] was put together and nurtured by Rickey.&quot;

Rickey fast-tracked youngsters like Law and Bob Friend, signed by his predecessor, Roy Hamey, to the majors. He recruited Groat off the Duke University campus, drafted Face and Clemente from Brooklyn&#x27;s minor league system, and his scouts and minor league instructors found Mazeroski and developed him for MLB delivery in 1956. Pittsburgh&#x27;s farm and scouting system would continue to be highly productive into the 1970s, especially in developing Latin American players signed by scout Howie Haak, one of the people whom Rickey had brought to the Pirates from the Dodgers.

Rickey remained on the Pirate masthead as chairman of the board for almost four full seasons after Joe L. Brown succeeded him as general manager in October of . He also held a small amount of stock in the club. But that association ended in the middle of August 1959, when, nearing his 78th birthday, Rickey took on another challenge as the chief executive of a proposed third major league, the Continental League.

===President of Continental League (1959–1960)===

A significant shift in population from the Eastern and Midwestern United States to the West and South after World War II wreaked havoc with the established 16-team, two-league major league structure, opening up growing markets and triggering a two-decade-long series of franchise relocations beginning in . In , these were dramatized by the transfer of each of New York City&#x27;s National League teams, the Dodgers and Giants, to California, abandoning their established fan bases. When mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. and attorney William Shea were unsuccessful in their attempts to attract Senior Circuit teams from smaller markets (including the Pirates) to New York, Shea announced plans for a third major league in professional baseball, the Continental League, on July 27, 1959. In addition to New York, the Continental would be represented by clubs in Denver, Houston, Minneapolis–Saint Paul and Toronto, plus three additional markets to round out an eight-team league. It was scheduled to begin play in April 1961.

Three weeks after the formation of the new circuit was announced, on August 18, 1959, Rickey sold his stake in the Pirates, resigned as board chairman, and signed a 16-month contract to become the first president of the new league at a reported $50,000 annual salary (equivalent to approximately $ in ). He immediately led a delegation of Continental League owners to a summit meeting in a Manhattan hotel with Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick, the presidents of the National and American leagues, and a subcommittee of MLB club owners. The established leagues were wary of a new challenge to baseball&#x27;s antitrust law exemption, when the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Emanuel Celler, a Brooklyn Democrat enraged by his borough&#x27;s loss of the Dodgers, introduced legislation that would place baseball under antitrust law. This concern led Frick and his entourage to publicly treat the Continental League with respect; at the meeting, Frick asked Rickey and the other league presidents (Warren Giles and Joe Cronin) to form a committee that would set up ground rules to govern the admission of the Continental to eventual equal status with the two major leagues.

As those rules were taking shape, Rickey presided over the admission of the Continental League&#x27;s three remaining founding franchises: Atlanta, Buffalo and Dallas–Fort Worth. He made public appearances—for example, as the &quot;mystery guest&quot; on the prime-time TV quiz show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;—to advance his view that a third, eight-team league would be more beneficial to baseball than expansion of the two existing circuits. But behind the scenes, National and American league owners were working on their own plans to expand their loops and scuttle Rickey&#x27;s start-up league. In August 1960, they offered the Continental League&#x27;s owners a deal: each established league would add two new franchises by 1962. In return, they demanded that the new circuit disband. Against Rickey&#x27;s advice, his owners agreed to the compromise and the new league perished, still on the drawing board.

In 1961, Minneapolis–Saint Paul got a 60-year-old American League franchise, the transferred Washington Senators, with an expansion team replacing them in the capital. In 1962, the New York Mets and Houston Colt .45s were admitted to the Senior Circuit as expansion teams. By 1993, all of the Continental League&#x27;s cities except Buffalo were in Major League Baseball.

===Return to Cardinals (1962–1964)===

After negotiations broke down in March 1961 that would have seen Rickey take over the Mets as their first president and general manager, he went into temporary retirement. The year also saw Rickey endure tragedy and hardship on a personal level. On April 10, 1961, his son, Branch Jr., farm system director of the Pirates, died from complications of diabetes at the age of 47. Then, on June 27, Rickey suffered a &quot;serious&quot; heart attack—his second cardiac event since 1958—while staying at his summer home on Canada&#x27;s Manitoulin Island and was airlifted to a Sudbury, Ontario, hospital for treatment. Upon his recovery, Rickey and his wife, Jane, decided to move from suburban Pittsburgh back to St. Louis in 1962, where, on October 29, Rickey returned to the Cardinals exactly 20 years to the day he left to become general consultant on the development of Cardinal players and special advisor to owner August A. Busch Jr.

But Rickey&#x27;s second stint with the Cardinals was marred by controversy. He recommended that Cardinal icon Stan Musial be compelled to retire, even after the eventual Hall of Famer&#x27;s stellar season, in which Musial, 41, had finished third in the National League batting race (hitting .330 in 135 games played), and broken Honus Wagner&#x27;s NL record for career hits. Rickey wrote to Busch: &quot;He can&#x27;t run, he can&#x27;t field, and he can&#x27;t throw. Twenty-five Musials would finish in last place.&quot; Musial would play one more campaign before retiring from the field in September 1963.

Rickey also undermined St. Louis general manager Bing Devine, who had begun his baseball career under Rickey in the late 1930s as an office boy. He was a vocal critic of one of Devine&#x27;s highest profile (and most successful) trades, when he acquired veteran shortstop Groat from Pittsburgh after the 1962 season. Rickey believed that Groat, 32 at the time, was too old. Groat, however, still had two prime years left. He batted .319 () and .292 (), and was runner-up in the National League&#x27;s 1963 Most Valuable Player Award balloting. He was the NL&#x27;s starting shortstop in both the 1963 and 1964 All-Star games, and helped lead the 1963 Cardinals to a second-place finish. But the 1964 team fell behind in the standings and seemed stalled in fifth place in mid-August. When Busch fired Devine on August 17 and replaced him with Rickey protégé Bob Howsam, the 82-year-old consultant and special advisor was cast as the cause of Devine&#x27;s downfall. The controversial firing embarrassed Busch when the team Devine assembled caught fire in the season&#x27;s final six weeks, won the National League pennant, and triumphed in the 1964 World Series. After the season, Busch terminated Rickey&#x27;s contract, ending a professional baseball career that had spanned 62 years.

==Death==
A public speaker in his later years, on November 13, 1965, Rickey collapsed in the middle of a speech in Columbia, Missouri, as he was being elected to the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame. He had told a story of physical courage and was about to relate an illustration from the Bible. &quot;Now I&#x27;m going to tell you a story from the Bible about spiritual courage,&quot; he said. Rickey murmured he could not continue, collapsed and never spoke again. He faltered, fell back into his seat and slipped onto the floor. He never regained consciousness. His brain was damaged when his breathing stopped momentarily, though his heart picked up its rhythm again. Through the next 26 days, hospitalized in a coma, there was little change.

On December 9 at about 10 p.m., he died of heart failure at Boone County Memorial Hospital in Columbia, Missouri, 11 days before his 84th birthday. Branch Rickey was interred at Rush Township Burial Park in Rushtown, Ohio, near where his parents, his widow, Jane (who died in 1971), and three of his children (including Branch Jr.) also rest. Rickey&#x27;s grave overlooks the Scioto Valley, about three miles from his boyhood home in Stockdale, Ohio.

==Honors and legacy==
According to historian Harold Seymour:
:Branch Rickey stands forth as professional baseball&#x27;s counterpart of that oldest stereotype of American folklore, the shrewd hard-working, God-fearing Yankee trader. He was also one of baseball&#x27;s genuine innovators, an administrator who made a lasting imprint upon the industry...[His] seeming contradictions between profession and practice, together with this skill and oratorical obfuscation and circumlocution, caused many to regard Rickey as a hypocritical mountebank. Yet even his detractors acknowledged Rickey&#x27;s industriousness, organizing genius, an unsurpassed ability to judge the potential of raw recruits... Rickey built the Cardinals into a baseball empire that, at its peak, comprised 32 clubs, 600 or 700 players, and an investment of more than $2 million.

In addition to Rickey&#x27;s election to the Baseball Hall of Fame as a contributor in 1967, in 1997 he was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame, in 2009 he was elected to the College Baseball Hall of Fame.

In January 2014, the Cardinals announced Rickey among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.

A ballpark in Portsmouth, Ohio, once used by the Portsmouth Explorers, a charter member of the Frontier League before the club folded in 1996, is named in Rickey&#x27;s honor. The Branch Rickey Arena at Ohio Wesleyan University is also named in his honor.

A section of US Highway 23 in Ohio, running north from the Franklin County border to the city of Delaware, has been named the Branch Rickey Memorial Highway.

In 1992, Rotary International of Denver, Colorado, created the Branch Rickey Award, which is given annually to a Major League Baseball player in recognition of exceptional community service. Outside of Coors Field in Denver is a monument to Rickey by the sculptor George Lundeen, dedicated in 2005, with this simple inscription:

Another quotation attributed to Rickey is:

Members of his family also became involved in baseball. Son Branch Jr. was an executive with the Dodgers and Pirates for over two decades prior to his 1961 death, and grandson Branch Rickey III served as a farm system director with the Pirates and Cincinnati Reds and president of the Triple-A American Association and Pacific Coast League during a 57-year baseball career. His brother Frank Wanzer Rickey (1888–1953) scouted for the Cardinals and Dodgers; his signees included Hall of Famers Slaughter and Johnny Mize. Frank Rickey&#x27;s son-in-law, Charles A. Hurth (1906–1969), was a longtime minor league executive who served as president of the Double-A Southern Association and, briefly in the spring of 1961, as the first general manager of the Mets when Branch Rickey and the team were still discussing a top role in the New York front office; that job ultimately went to George Weiss, the former Yankee executive.

Moreover, Rickey&#x27;s influence continued to loom large after his passing, especially in the National League. One year after his 1965 death, five of the league&#x27;s ten general managers—Howsam (Cardinals), Devine (Mets), Brown (Pirates), Buzzie Bavasi (Dodgers) and Bill DeWitt (Reds), as well as NL president Giles—had at one time worked under Rickey during his long executive career.

===Portrayals on stage, film and television===
Due to his connection with Jackie Robinson, Rickey has been portrayed numerous times on screen and stage:

* In the 1950 movie &quot;The Jackie Robinson Story&quot;, he is portrayed by Minor Watson.
* In the 1996 HBO movie &quot;Soul of the Game&quot;, Rickey is played by Edward Herrmann.
* In the 2013 film &quot;42&quot;, Rickey is played by Harrison Ford. Rickey&#x27;s great-granddaughter, actress Kelley Jakle, also appears in the film.
* Rickey is the title character in the 1989 Edward Schmidt play &quot;Mr. Rickey Calls a Meeting&quot;, a fictionalized version of the meeting in which Rickey offered Jackie Robinson a major-league contract.

Additionally, he was also featured heavily in the 2016 PBS documentary, &quot;Jackie Robinson&quot;, which was directed by Ken Burns.

<text>The Progressive Citizens&#x27; Party in Liechtenstein (, FBP) is a conservative political party in Liechtenstein. The FBP is one of the two major political parties in Liechtenstein, along with the liberal-conservative Patriotic Union. Founded in 1918 along with the now-defunct Christian-Social People&#x27;s Party, it is the oldest party in Liechtenstein.

==History==
The party was established in 1918 by middle class citizens and members of the agricultural community as a response to the formation of the Christian-Social People&#x27;s Party (VP). In addition to being linked to the commercial and rural environment, the party was also firmly anchored in the clergy. It won the majority of the elected the 1918 elections, but the VP formed a government following the November 1918 Liechtenstein putsch.

The VP won elections in 1922, January 1926 and April 1926, but the FBP won the 1928 elections, and became the party of government until 1938, with Josef Hoop serving as prime minister until 1945. In 1938 the FBP allowed the Patriotic Union (VU) to join it in a coalition government. The two parties governed in coalition until the 1997 elections, after which the Patriotic Union formed a government. The FBP won the 2001 elections and its leader Otmar Hasler became prime minister. Following the 2005 elections the coalition was renewed, with Hasler remaining prime minister. The VU&#x27;s Klaus Tschütscher held the post between 2009 and 2013, after which FBP leader Adrian Hasler became prime minister.

In the 2017 state election, the FBP lost 4.8% of the vote and was awarded only nine of the 25 seats. However, it remained the party with the most votes in the state parliament, as the Patriotic Union only gained slightly and still had eight Landtag members.

In the 2021 state elections, Adrian Hasler and government councilor Mauro Pedrazzini (also a FBP member) decided not to run for government again after eight years. With Sabine Monauni, the FBP nominated a woman as prime minister candidate for the state elections for the first time. The party nominated Katrin Eggenberger and Manuel Frick as further candidates for the government. 

The FBP won 35.9% of the votes in the 2021 state elections and won 10 seats in the Landtag. Mathematically, the FBP was elected by around 100 voters (0.6%) more. The discrepancy arose from the fact that the voters in the Oberland, with 15 votes per ballot paper, had a higher weight on the total party vote result than the voters in the Unterland with ten votes per person. Voter turnout was stable at 78.0%. The FBP and VU formed a coalition government, which appointed Monauni as deputy prime minister. If she had become prime minister, she would have been the first female to hold the position.

In the 2025 elections, former president of the landtag Ernst Walch was the party&#x27;s candidate for prime minister. The party further nominated Sabine Monauni and Daniel Oehry as government candidates. In the election, the FBP won 7 seats with 27.9% of the vote share, the lowest in its history.

== Ideology and policy ==
The FBP tends to be conservative on social/cultural issues. As for economic issues, it is economically liberal but also claims to follow a social market economy policy. The party states its policies are based on Christian values such as solidarity, respect and justice. It also advocates a dualistic form of government, claiming to support both the monarchy and the people as sovereigns.

=== Women&#x27;s rights ===
The FBP was an early proponent of the introduction of women&#x27;s suffrage to Liechtenstein, starting in 1970. However, two separate referendums on the issue were rejected by male-only voters in 1971 and 1973 respectively. The Women in the FBP group was founded in September 1982 to represent women&#x27;s issues within the party, and also to further advocate for the introduction of women&#x27;s suffrage. The party then again proposed the issue to the Landtag of Liechtenstein in December 1983 and again in April 1984. Following a successful referendum (among men only) in July 1984, women&#x27;s suffrage was introduced to Liechtenstein.

Emma Eigenmann, belonging to the FBP, was the woman elected to the Landtag of Liechtenstein in 1986. In the first Mario Frick cabinet, Cornelia Gassner, also belonging to the FBP, became the first female government councillor. Rita Kieber-Beck was also the first female Deputy Prime Minister of Liechtenstein.

=== LGBT rights ===

Compared to the Patriotic Union, members of the FBP are more inclined to support LGBT rights:
:a. Percentages do not add up to 100%.

The FBP also voted &quot;en bloc&quot; with the Free List (FL) party on 6 May 2022 to narrowly defeat a proposed legislation (i.e., &quot;Amendment to the Article 25 of the Partnership Act&quot;) that would have limited adoption and reproductive rights of same-sex couples.

<text>The Patriotic Union (, VU) is a liberal-conservative political party in Liechtenstein. The VU is one of the two major political parties in Liechtenstein, along with the monarchist-conservative Progressive Citizens&#x27; Party (FBP). The VU is the relatively more liberal of the two parties, supporting a constitutional monarchy and advocating for greater democratic governance. Since 2021, it is led by Thomas Zwiefelhofer and holds ten seats in the 25-member Landtag of Liechtenstein.

==History==
The Patriotic Union was formed by the 1936 merger of the Christian-Social People&#x27;s Party (VP) with the minor party Liechtenstein Homeland Service (LHD). While the VP was the larger and more popular party, following the merger members of the LHD took prominent positions in the leadership of the new party.

After decades of being second to the Progressive Citizens&#x27; Party, the VU became the largest party in the Landtag for the first time as a result of the 1970 general elections. Although it lost the 1974 elections to the FBP, it won the 1978 elections and retained its Landtag majority until February 1993. However, early elections in October 1993 saw it regain its majority, which it held until 2001. After the 2005 state elections, which brought in an all-time low of votes, the VU provided 10 of the 25 deputies and was represented by Deputy Prime Minister Klaus Tschütscher and Hugo Quaderer in the five-member government. The VU emerged as the clear winner from the 2009 state elections and had an absolute majority in the state parliament for the 2009–2013 legislative period with 13 seats and provided the new head of government in the coalition government with the FBP. The Patriotic Union lost five seats in the state parliament in the 2013 state elections and was then represented with eight seats and provided two of the four government councillors. In the 2017 state election, the Patriotic Union was able to slightly increase its share of the vote by 0.2%, but still retained 8 of the 25 seats in the state parliament. In the 2021 state elections, the VU achieved 10 out of 25 mandates and recorded a 2.1% increase in votes compared to the 2017 state elections.

Currently, its member Daniel Risch is the head of government. Furthermore, the party also has two members (Dominique Hasler and Graziella Marok-Wachter) as government councillors.

== Ideology ==
The party is liberal-conservative but has members that are more socially conservative, especially when it comes to LGBT rights. It is also economically liberal, advocating a modern liberal market economy with a balanced budget.

<doc id="426360" wikidata="Q7518916" url="?curid=426360" title="Simon Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt">
<text>Simon Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt, PC (December 1661 – 29 July 1727) of Stanton Harcourt, Oxfordshire, was an English Tory politician who sat in the English and British House of Commons from 1690 until 1710. He was raised to the peerage as Baron Harcourt in 1711 and sat in the House of Lords, becoming Queen Anne&#x27;s Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain. He was her solicitor-general and her commissioner for arranging the union with Scotland. He took part in the negotiations preceding the Peace of Utrecht.

==Early life==
Harcourt was born in December 1661 at Stanton Harcourt, Oxfordshire, to Stanton Harcourt, the only son of Sir Philip Harcourt, and his first wife Anne Waller, daughter of Sir William Waller of Osterley Park, Middlesex. He was educated at a school at Shilton, Oxfordshire, under Samuel Birch, to 1677 and was admitted at Inner Temple in 1676. He matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford, on 30 March 1677, aged 15, and was awarded BA in 1679. In 1683, he was Called to the Bar. He had four brothers and four sisters from his father&#x27;s second marriage in 1674 to Elizabeth Lee. He succeeded to the family estates on the death of his father on 20 March 1688.

==Career==
Harcourt was recorder of Abingdon from June to December 1687 and, after a break at the time of the revolution, from October 1689 to April 1711. At the 1690 English general election, he was returned as Tory Member of Parliament for Abingdon. In 1701 he was nominated by the Commons to conduct the impeachment of Lord Somers. In 1702 he became solicitor-general and was knighted by Queen Anne. In the same year he became bencher and treasurer of his Inn and was awarded DCL at Oxford University. At the 1705 English general election, he was returned as MP for Bossiney, and as commissioner for arranging the union with Scotland which he was largely instrumental in promoting. Harcourt was appointed attorney-general in 1707, but resigned office in the following year when his friend Robert Harley, afterwards Earl of Oxford, was dismissed.

Harcourt defended Sacheverell at the bar of the House of Lords in 1710, being then without a seat in Parliament; but in the same year was returned for Cardigan, and in September again became attorney-general. In October he was appointed lord keeper of the great seal, and in virtue of this office he presided in the House of Lords for some months without a peerage, until, on 3 September 1711, he was created Baron Harcourt of Stanton Harcourt; but it was not till April 1713 that he received the appointment of Lord Chancellor. In 1710 he had purchased the Nuneham Courtenay estate in Oxfordshire, but his usual place of residence continued to be at Cokethorpe near Stanton Harcourt, where he once received a state visit from Queen Anne.

In the negotiations preceding the Peace of Utrecht, Harcourt took an important part. There is no sufficient evidence for the allegations of the Whigs that Harcourt entered into treasonable relations with the Pretender. On the accession of George I however, he was deprived of office and retired to Cokethorpe, where he enjoyed the society of men of letters, Swift, Pope, Prior and other famous writers being among his frequent guests. With Swift, however, he had occasional quarrels, during one of which the great satirist bestowed on him the sobriquet of &quot;Trimming Harcourt.&quot;

He exerted himself to defeat the impeachment of Lord Oxford in 1717, and in 1723 he was active in obtaining a pardon for another old political friend, Lord Bolingbroke. In 1721 Harcourt was created a viscount and returned to the privy councils; and on several occasions during the king&#x27;s absences from England he was on the Council of Regency. In 1726, he acquired the manor of Cogges from the heirs of Sir Francis Blake.

==Private life==
Harcourt enjoyed the reputation of being a brilliant orator; Speaker Onslow going so far as to say that &quot;Harcourt had the greatest skill and power of speech of any man I ever knew in a public assembly.&quot; He was a member of the famous Saturday Club, frequented by the chief literati and wits of the period, with several of whom he corresponded. Some letters to him from Pope are preserved in the Harcourt Papers. His portrait was painted by Kneller; it was once at Nuneham House.

Harcourt married first at St Marylebone on 18 October 1680 Rebecca Clarke (buried at Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, 16 May 1687), daughter of the Rev. Thomas Clarke, his father&#x27;s chaplain, by whom he had five children; secondly Elizabeth Spencer (c. 1657 – Downing Street, 16 June 1724), daughter of Richard Spencer; and thirdly in Oxfordshire on 30 September 1724 Elizabeth Vernon (c. 1678 – 12 July 1748), daughter of Sir Thomas Vernon, of Twickenham Park. He left children by his first wife only:
* Hon. Simon Harcourt (1684 – 1 July 1720), who was MP for Wallingford, and predeceased his father, the Lord Chancellor, leaving a son, married Elizabeth Evelyn, sister of Sir John Evelyn, of Wotton, and daughter of John Evelyn, by whom he had one son and four daughters:
** Simon Harcourt, 1st Earl Harcourt
** Hon. Martha Harcourt (15 July 1715 – London, Lower Grosvenor Street, 8 April 1794), married at St George, Hanover Square, on 10 April 1744 George Venables-Vernon, afterwards Baron Vernon (9 February 1708 – 21 August 1780)
** Hon. Anne Harcourt
** Hon. Elizabeth Harcourt
** Hon. daughter Harcourt
* Hon. Philip Harcourt, died young
* Hon. Anne Harcourt, married John Barlow
* Hon. Arabella Harcourt, married Herbert Aubrey

He died at 2am at Harcourt House, Cavendish Square, and was interred at Stanton Harcourt 4 August.

<doc id="426362" wikidata="Q49668" url="?curid=426362" title="Free List (Liechtenstein)">
<text>The Free List (, FL) is a centre-left to left-wing political party in Liechtenstein. As of 2025, it has two seats in the Landtag of Liechtenstein and is represented in five of the eleven local councils. It was founded in 1985 and described itself as social-democratic and green.

== History ==
The Free List ran for the first time in the 1986 state elections. In this election, and also in the 1989 election, it was unable to overcome the threshold clause.

In 1993, the Free List overcame the 8% electoral threshold for the first time with over 10% in the state elections and was also able to consolidate in the early elections in the same year with 8.5%, although this remained its worst result since then. Having increased to over 11% in 1997 and falling again somewhat in 2001, FL reached a record 13.0% of the votes in the 2005 election and thus won three out of a total of 25 mandates. In the 2009 elections, it fell to 8.9% and was only able to win one seat. In the 2013 election, its share rose again to over 11%, which in turn brought the party three mandates. In the state elections on February 5, 2017, the party gained 1.5%, but this didn&#x27;t change the number of seats.

In the 2021 state election, the Free List gained 12.9%, an increase of 0.3%, but the number of seats held by the party remained the same.

== Policies ==
The central themes of the Free List are sexual equality, social justice, solidarity, environmental protection, good public transport services, and the integration of foreigners. It advocates the introduction of a representative monarchy in the Principality, limiting the veto powers of the monarchs. Secularist, it also criticizes the relation between the state and the Catholic Church in Liechtenstein, as well as the Archdiocese of Vaduz and the Archbishop Wolfgang Haas for their socially conservative attitude.

== Youth wing ==
The Young List (, JL) was founded in 2019 as a young party associated with the Free List. In September 2020, the youth organization presented its goals for the first time at the General Assembly of the Free List.

In October 2020, Young List started collecting signatures for a petition with the aim of lowering the voting age in Liechtenstein to 16. In May 2021, JL addressed a corresponding petition to the state parliament, which referred it to the government.

In September 2021, the Young List was constituted as a separate association.

At the general assembly in August 2022, the members Daniel Lochner (from Triesen) and Samuel Schurte (from Balzers) decided to stand as mayoral candidates in the 2023 municipal elections.

According to its own statements, the Young List has around 60 members (as of 2022).

<text>Anolis carolinensis or green anole () (among other names below) is a tree-dwelling species of anole lizard native to the southeastern United States and introduced to islands in the Pacific and Caribbean. A small to medium-sized lizard, the green anole is a trunk-crown ecomorph and can change its color to several shades from brown to green.

Other names include the Carolina anole, Carolina green anole, American anole, American green anole, North American green anole and red-throated anole. It is commonly called chameleon in the southeastern United States and sometimes referred to as the American chameleon (typically in the pet trade) due to its color-changing ability; however, it is not a true chameleon.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Anolis carolinensis&quot; is a species of the large lizard genus &quot;Anolis&quot; within the family Dactyloidae (anole lizards). This species was named by Friedrich Siegmund Voigt (1781-1850) in 1832.

Phylogenetic evidence indicates that the Carolina anole belongs to the &quot;Anolis carolinensis&quot; anole series, a wider clade of Caribbean &quot;Anolis&quot; which are all also known as &quot;green anoles&quot;. This group is composed of mid-sized trunk-crown anoles with large, conspicuously elongated heads and extreme levels of sexual dimorphism. Other members of this thirteen-species clade include &quot;A. brunneus &amp; A. smaragdinus&quot; from the Bahamas, &quot;A. longiceps&quot; from Navassa Island, &quot;A. maynardii&quot; from the Cayman Islands, and &quot;A. allisoni&quot; &amp; &quot;A. porcatus&quot; from Cuba; &quot;A. carolinensis&quot; is the only member of this clade native to the American mainland. Genetic analysis indicates that &quot;A. carolinensis&quot; originates from an oceanic dispersal event of an ancestral green anole from Cuba to the southern United States during the late Miocene or Pliocene. This is a rare example of an insular species successfully colonizing the mainland of a continent rather than the more common vice versa, although several other Caribbean animal and plant groups have similarly successfully colonized mainland North America via Florida. The present diversity of Central and South American anoles is also thought to originate from a colonization of the American mainland by an insular Caribbean anole taxon.

== Description ==
The anole is a small to medium-sized lizard, with a slender body. The head is long and pointed with ridges between the eyes and nostrils, and smaller ones on the top of the head. The toes have adhesive pads to facilitate climbing. Green anoles use jumping for their primary means of locomotion. They exhibit sexual dimorphism, the males being fifteen percent larger. Adult males within a population can be classified within a heavyweight and a lightweight morph. The male dewlap (throat fan) is three times the size of the female&#x27;s and bright orange to red, whereas that of the female is lighter in color. The dewlap is usually pink for &quot;Anolis carolinensis&quot; (more orange-red in &quot;A. sagrei&quot;) and is very rarely present in females. The color of the dewlap is variable and different from the lizard eye to the human eye. Green anoles are thought to be capable of seeing a larger range of the UV spectrum, and that the dewlap reflects ultraviolet light to attract mates. Female anoles do, however, often have a dorsal line down their back. Extension of the dewlap from the throat is used for communication. Males can form a pronounced dorsal ridge behind the head when displaying or when under stress. Females and juveniles have a prominent white stripe running along their spine, a feature most males lack.

Adult males are usually long, with about 60-70% of which is made up of its tail. They have a body length, also known as a snout to vent length (SVL), up to and can weigh from .

===Coloration and color morphs===
Colour varies from brown to green and can be changed like many other kinds of lizards, but anoles are closely related to iguanas and are not true chameleons. Although &quot;A. carolinensis&quot; is sometimes called an &#x27;American chameleon&#x27;, true chameleons do not naturally occur in the Americas, and &quot;A. carolinensis&quot; is not the only lizard currently in its area of distribution capable of changing colour. In contrast, many species of true chameleons display a greater range of color adaptation, though some can hardly change color at all.

Typical coloration for a green anole ranges from bright green to dark brown, with little variation in between. The color spectrum is a result of three layers of pigment cells or chromatophores: the xanthophores, responsible for the yellow pigmentation; cyanophores, responsible for the blue pigmentation, and melanophores, responsible for the brown and black pigmentation. The anole changes its color depending on mood, level of stress, activity level and as a social signal (for example, displaying dominance). &quot;Anolis carolinensis&quot; takes darker coloration as its base color at the beginning of the breeding season when it is generally cooler, and the adult males change their body coloration to more greenish when they need to advertise their territorial possession. Although often claimed, evidence does not support that they do it in response to the color of the background (camouflage). Whether they do it in response to temperature (thermoregulation) is less clear, with studies both supporting it and contradicting it. Changing color while under a sharply contrasting shadow can cause a &quot;stencil effect&quot;, where the outline of the shadow is temporarily imprinted in the animal&#x27;s coloration (see image in gallery, below). When stressed—while fighting, for example—the skin just behind the lizard&#x27;s eyes may turn black independently from the rest of the animal&#x27;s coloration, forming &quot; spots&quot;.

A lack in one of the pigment genes causes color exceptions. These color mutations are also called phases. The rare blue-phased green anole lacks xanthophores, which results in a blue, rather than red, often pastel blue, anole. These specimens have become popular recently in the pet trade market. When the anole is completely lacking xanthophores, it is said to be axanthic and the animal will have a completely pastel- or baby-blue hue. They are extremely rare—usually produced in one of every 20,000 individual anoles in the wild. Another phase is the yellow-phased green anole, which lacks cyanophores. Colonies of these rare color-phased anoles have been reported, but anoles with these color mutations rarely live for long, since the green color provides camouflage for hunting down prey, as well as hiding from predators.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species is native to North America, where it is found mainly in the subtropical southeastern parts of the continent. Anoles are the most abundant on the Atlantic Coastal Plains in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, and on the Gulf Coast in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, where they extend inland as far as Texas Hill Country and the DFW Metroplex; they have also been recorded in Tamaulipas, Mexico, but it is mostly likely an introduction. In the Carolinas, they are found on the coastal plains as far north as False Cape in Virginia, and in the southern piedmont of North Carolina, but throughout South Carolina, while in Georgia they are widespread except in the Blue Ridge region.

The species has been introduced into various locales in the Pacific and the Caribbean: Hawaii, the Ogasawara Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Bahamas, Anguilla, Palau, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, as well as the Canary Islands. In 2005 they were recognized and listed as an invasive alien species in the Ogasawara Islands of Japan for causing insect population collapse. Green anoles have also been considered successful invaders as they have made their way into parts of Europe. They have been sighted in Orange County and San Diego County of southern California, with sightings in San Diego going at least as far back as 1993.

&quot;A. carolinensis&quot; is arboreal in nature but may be seen on the ground and frequently seen on shrubs in the low country of the Carolinas. However, it can live in cities like Atlanta with little trouble so long as there is plentiful vegetation and bugs to eat. One can observe them on steps, trellises, and railings adjacent to foliage; on particularly hot summer days they may seek to cool off on indoor walls or on wrap around porches of older buildings, and in the former case can simply be captured in a shoebox and gently placed outdoors. It is common on roadsides, the edges of forests where there are shrubs and vines, but also construction sites having abundant foliage and sunlight. Their preferred habitat is open pine communities with a greater shrub density, it may harbor a greater abundance of anoles where they are able to watch for prey and intruders coming into their territory.

== Conservation ==
Although not threatened as a species, Carolina anoles increasingly struggle with competition from introduced anole species, such as the brown anole (&quot;Anolis sagrei&quot;), also known as the Bahamian anole. This competition happened to be an interesting model for evolutionary studies, as it illustrates the process of adaptation. When &quot;A. sagrei&quot; first appeared in the United States in the early 1900s, the Carolina anole mostly ceded ground-level territories and were relegated to a very different ecosystem high in the treetops. On occasion, more aggressive Carolina anole individuals may still be seen closer to the ground. Currently, &quot;A. carolinensis&quot; is abundant in its area of distribution and is able to thrive in disturbed areas, so it is not considered threatened, but &quot;A. sagrei&quot; may represent a developing threat in some areas.

== Relationships and hybridization ==
&quot;A. carolinensis&quot; has been found to regularly hybridize with a closely related species, &quot;Anolis porcatus&quot; (the Cuban green anole), in Southern Florida, where &quot;A. porcatus&quot; has been introduced. A 2022 study found there to be asymmetric introgression of certain &quot;A. porcatus&quot; alleles within the population of hybrid individuals, three of which were found to be significantly associated with environmental variables indicative of urbanization. It remains uncertain as to how this admixture of invasive alleles to the Carolina anole will affect the conservation of the species going forward. Not all admixture from invasive populations should be viewed as a negative outcome, and adaptive introgression as a result of hybridization with an ecologically robust invasive population might facilitate the long-term survival of native populations otherwise unable to adapt to human impact on the environment.

==Behavior==
Male anoles are strongly territorial creatures. Some have even been witnessed fighting their own reflections in mirrored glass. The male will fight other males to defend his territory. On sighting another male, the anole will compress his body, extend the dewlap, inflate a dorsal ridge, bob his head and attempt to chase the rival away. If the rival male continues to approach, anoles will fight by biting and scratching each other. Studies have also shown that there is a positive correlation between bite-force and the size of the individual&#x27;s dewlap.
One study showed that heavyweights had 50% higher testosterone concentrations than lightweights during the breeding season. It seems that disproportionately larger heads and dewlaps may be correlated to higher bite forces of heavyweights. Those with darker colorations will choose lower perch sites compared to their lighter conspecifics. For heavyweight males of the same size the one with the higher bite force wins disputes more frequently.
Adult female anoles have much smaller dewlaps that they rarely use during encounters with other anoles and never use during courting. Serious injury is rare, but males often carry numerous scars on their heads and faces, especially during the mating season. Their territories, which are about , usually include two to three females.

The Carolina anole is diurnal and active throughout the year, peaking in spring and fall. Winter activity is dependent on sun and temperature.

==Diet==
An anole&#x27;s diet consists primarily of small insects such as crickets, grasshoppers, flies, butterflies, moths, cockroaches, small beetles, and other arthropods, including spiders, as well as occasionally feeding on various molluscs, grains, and seeds. Although anoles have been observed preying upon smaller reptiles such as juvenile skinks, this is not thought to be typical behavior. Many people who keep these lizards as pets feed them mealworms, grubs, maggots, and small crickets.

== Predators ==
Major predators include the broadhead skink, snakes, birds, and in urban habitats, cats. Like many lizards, anoles display autotomic tails, which wiggle when broken off. This distracts the predator and helps the anole to escape. A new tail then starts to develop. The new tail, however, containing cartilage rather than bone, will typically not grow back to the same length as the first one, and may exhibit a marked difference in color and texture from the rest of the animal. Green anoles will also try to escape predators by climbing vertical walls, trees, fences, or any vertical surface they can find. This ability is possible due to their enlarged toe pads and great climbing ability.

Anoles are parasitized by some species of sarcophagid flies, including &quot;Lepidodexia blakeae&quot;. Adult flies will deposit eggs on live anoles, and the fly larvae develop inside the lizard until they emerge from a wound and pupate into adult flies in sediment. Infection is often fatal, with mortality rates possibly as high as 90%.

==Reproduction==

The typical breeding season for Carolina anoles starts as early as April and ends in late September, gonadal activity being largely regulated by photoperiod, enlarging in spring as the weather warms up and days lengthen, and then regressing in late summer. At the beginning of the non-breeding season, green anoles experience a refractory season, which would occur from late fall until late winter/early spring.

During this time, the males patrol their territory and the most brilliant displays of these creatures can be seen. Males defend their territory and females from rivals, while courting the females with elaborate displays of extending their brightly colored dewlaps while bobbing up and down, almost doing a dance. The dewlap is also used to ward off other males. The male courts and pursues a female until the two successfully mate. Usually, when the female is ready to mate, she may let the male catch her, at which point he will grasp her by biting a fold of her skin behind her neck. The male will then position his tail underneath the female&#x27;s tail near her vent. Males have two sex organs, known as hemipenes, which are normally kept within the body, but are everted from his vent for mating. Males seem to alternate between the left and right hemipenis on successive matings.

The female matures one ovarian follicle at a time, the ovaries alternating in production. The sight of a courting male induces ovarian development, sexual receptiveness and then ovulation. About two to four weeks following mating, the female lays her first clutch of eggs, usually one or two in the first clutch. She can produce an egg every two weeks during the breeding season, until about 10 eggs have been produced. However, she can store sperm for up to eight months following mating. She then buries the soft-shelled eggs in a shallow depression in soft soil, leaf litter, compost, rotting wood, or even a hole in a nearby tree. Eggs average by in size.
The eggs are left to incubate by the heat of the sun, and if successful, will hatch in about five to seven weeks (30–45 days) from late May to early October. The incubation temperature has to be . On hatching, the hatchlings are in length.

The hatchlings must fend for themselves, as they are not cared for by either parent. The young hatchlings must be wary of other adult anoles in the area, as well as larger reptiles and mammals, which could eat them. Younger anoles differ from adults in having less obvious head ridges, a wider head and shorter tail. They mature in about eight months.

==Captivity==
Carolina anoles&#x27; nervous natures makes it advisable not to attempt to handle them very often; despite this, Carolina anoles are popular pets. Individual animals may or may not adapt readily to cage life. Care must be taken to ensure the animals receive the support they need to adapt to captivity. An adequately sized enclosure, as well as the appropriate plants and substrate material, are beneficial to the health of captive Carolina anoles.

A green anole in captivity, if cared properly, can live up to 8 years. These lizards can be easily kept in a 10-gallon aquarium as they rarely grow more than 8 inches.

However, there should be one male green anole in a tank as they are territorial and may end up fighting for the territory. Keeping multiple female green anoles in a tank won&#x27;t create any problem unless there isn&#x27;t enough room for them.

Green anoles are considered to be a good pet for beginners as they are easy to care for. Their habitat should include the following:
* Humidity level should be kept at 60-70%.
* Day temperature should be maintained at .
* Night temperature should be maintained at .
* A basking light should be installed in the tank and a temperature of must be maintained.
* Natural light is best for reptiles, but a UVB light can be installed in the terrarium. A 5.0 UVB light would be a good option.
* Green anoles are terrestrial lizards and spend most of their time on the ground or climbing plants. They do not dig or burrow. A substrate should not be harmful for their skin. Substrate can be made using coconut coir, moss, reptile soil, etc., which is natural and also helps maintain moisture and temperature.
* Hatchlings should be given 2-3 food items (insects) once a day, whereas an adult should be fed 2-3 food insects every other day. Gut loading or dusting of insects can provide better nutrients to the lizards in captivity.

==Genomics==
This species has been chosen as a model reptile for genomics by the National Human Genome Research Institute genome sequencing program. It was selected because of the ease and low cost of laboratory breeding and evolutionary value of the diversity of the genus. In 2011, the complete genome of this lizard was sequenced and published in &quot;Nature&quot;. Before its genome was published, only mammals and three bird species had been sequenced among amniotes. The draft genome sequence is 1.78 Gb (compared with 2.0–3.6 Gb mammalian and 0.9–1.3 Gb avian genome assemblies), of which 27% are mobile elements such as LINEs. A total of 17,472 protein-coding genes and 2,924 RNA genes were predicted from the &quot;A. carolinensis&quot; genome assembly.

<text>Rally &amp; Issues () was a conservative political party in the Principality of Monaco. The party was the main party in the coalition Horizon Monaco after the 2013 Monegasque general election.

==History==

The party was established as the National and Democratic Union () in 1962 by a merger of the National Union of Independents and the National Democratic Entente, who between them held all 18 seats in the National Council. The new party won 17 of the 18 seats in the 1963 elections, and all 18 in the 1968 elections. It was reduced to 16 seats in 1973 as two opposition parties won seats, but won every seat again in the 1978, 1983 and 1988 elections.

In the 1993 elections it lost three seats, but retained a large majority. It won all 18 seats again in 1998, but the 2003 elections saw it win just three seats as it was defeated by the Union for Monaco alliance. It changed its name to Rally &amp; Issues prior to the 2008 elections, and incorporated the Rally for Monaco as well as Values and Issues.

<doc id="426367" wikidata="Q4799878" url="?curid=426367" title="Arthur Onslow">
<text>Arthur Onslow (1 October 169117 February 1768) was an English politician. He set a record for length of service when repeatedly elected to serve as Speaker of the House of Commons, where he was known for his integrity.

==Early life and education==
Onslow was born in Kensington, the elder son of Foot Onslow (died 1710) and his wife Susannah née Anlaby. He was educated at The Royal Grammar School, Guildford, and Winchester College and matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, in 1708, although he took no degree. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1713, but had no great practice in law.

==Career==
When George I came to the throne, Onslow&#x27;s uncle Sir Richard Onslow was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer. Arthur became his private secretary. When Richard left office in 1715, Arthur obtained a place as receiver general of the Post Office. He became Recorder of Guildford in 1719. As his Post Office position was not compatible with a parliamentary seat, he passed it on to his younger brother Richard when he entered Parliament in 1720 for Guildford.

==Marriage and family==
On 8 October 1720, Onslow married Anne Bridges (1703–1763), daughter of John Bridges of Thames Ditton, Surrey, and the niece and coheir of Henry Bridges of Imber Court. After his father-in-law died in the mid-1720s, Onslow came into the entire estate, which had increased through the addition of the holding of Ann&#x27;s sister, Rose, who had recently died. (She had married his younger brother Richard, whose life interest in her estate Arthur purchased after her death.) Inheriting estates from his wife&#x27;s family considerably improved Onslow&#x27;s financial position. Onslow made Imber Court in Thames Ditton his principal seat. Onslow and Anne had two children:
*George Onslow, 1st Earl of Onslow (1731–1814)
*Anne Onslow (died 20 December 1751)

==Politics==
In February 1720, Onslow had been returned as Whig Member of Parliament for Guildford at a by-election. He represented that borough until Parliament was dissolved in 1727. During this period, he was known to have declared against a proposal to levy Roman Catholics in 1722, and opposed the motion to reverse Bolingbroke&#x27;s attainder in 1725. In 1726, he was one of the Commons managers for the trial of Macclesfield for corruption.

In 1727, he was returned both for Guildford and Surrey, with the highest majority ever recorded, and elected to serve for Surrey; his younger brother Richard Onslow replaced him at Guildford in a by-election.

On 23 January 1728, Onslow was unanimously elected Speaker of the House of Commons, a post which had been held by his uncle Sir Richard Onslow, Bt, and his ancestor Richard Onslow. He would be unanimously re-elected Speaker in 1735, 1741, 1747 and 1754, setting a record for length of service in that office: 33 years. On 25 July 1728, he was sworn of the Privy Council, and was also made a bencher of the Middle Temple that year. The following year, on 13 May 1729, he was made Chancellor and Keeper of the Great Seal to Queen Caroline, who was godmother to his son George in 1731.

In October 1731 the Cotton Library caught fire. Onslow&#x27;s intervention on the night, throwing books out of the windows into the courtyard below, and subsequent oversight of their repair and preservation, saved many valuable books and manuscripts for the nation. 

Onslow&#x27;s speakership was distinguished by his great integrity in a corrupt and jobbing age. His great achievement as Speaker was to assert the independence, authority, and impartiality of that post. While he continued to participate in ordinary political activity, speaking and voting in committee, he did not hesitate to oppose Government policy when necessary. Onslow saw his role to be the protection and defence of Parliament in the tradition established by the Glorious Revolution. He insisted on rigidly observing parliamentary forms and procedure, which he viewed as a protection to independent MPs. But his devotion to precedent led him to condemn the reporting of parliamentary debates as breach of privilege.

On 20 April 1734, Onslow received the valuable office of Treasurer of the Navy. In 1742, after casting his vote on a highly political issue, he resigned the post to confute claims of political influence. He continued to receive emoluments from the office of Speaker, such as those for private bills. He also became Recorder of Guildford and high steward of Kingston upon Thames in 1737. During the 1730s, he was involved in the effort that led to the charter of the Foundling Hospital and was one of its founding governors. In 1753 he was instrumental in persuading Parliament to fund the purchase of Hans Sloane&#x27;s collection and the Harleian Library, which together with the Cotton Library established the British Museum.

Due to failing health, he retired from Parliament in 1761, doing so with the unanimous thanks of the House of Commons. He received an annuity of £3000 from the King for his life and that of his son, the first occasion upon which a retiring Speaker was pensioned.

==Legacy and honours==

* Onslow was awarded the Freedom of the City of London.
* He was voted a trustee of the British Museum.
* Onslow County, North Carolina, was named in his honour.

He died at his home in London in 1768 and was buried at Thames Ditton, but his body and that of his wife were later removed to the Onslow burial place in Merrow Church, Surrey.

Horace Walpole at one point said of him that he was &quot;too pompous to be loved, though too ridiculous to be hated&quot;, but subsequently wrote in more considered fashion:
No man had ever supported with more firmness the privileges of the House, nor sustained the dignity of his office with more authority. His knowledge of the constitution equalled his attachment to it. To the Crown he behaved with all the decorum of respect, without sacrificing his freedom of speech. Against the encroachments of the house of peers he was an inflexible champion. His disinterested virtue supported him through all his pretensions; and though to conciliate popular favour he affected an impartiality that by turns led him to the borders of insincerity and contradiction; and though he was often so minutely attached to forms, that it made him troublesome in affairs of higher moment, it will be difficult to find a subject, whom gravity will so well become, whose knowledge will be so useful and so accurate, and whose fidelity to his trust will prove so unshaken.

==Descendants==
Speaker Onslow&#x27;s nephew, George Onslow (1731–1792), a son of his brother Richard, was a lieutenant colonel and Member of Parliament for Guildford from 1760 to 1784. George had a younger brother Richard (1741–1817), who entered the Royal Navy and was promoted Admiral in 1799.

One of his descendants, Cranley Onslow, was a member of parliament in the late 20th century.

==Arthur Onslow in Thames Ditton==
Onslow gained much by his marriage to Ann. Onslow made Imber Court in Thames Ditton his principal seat. Early in his career, Onslow became High Steward of Kingston upon Thames. When he died in 1768 at the age of 76, he was buried at St Nicholas Church, Thames Ditton but subsequently his body, and that of his wife Ann, were moved to the Onslow burial site at Merrow Church, near Clandon.

<text>Abū al-Ḥassan, Aḥmad Ibn Ibrāhīm, al-Uqlīdisī (, ) was a mathematician of the Islamic Golden Age, possibly from Damascus, who wrote the earliest surviving book on the use of decimal fractions with Hindu–Arabic numerals, &quot;Kitāb al-Fuṣūl fī al-Ḥisāb al-Hindī&quot; (&quot;The Book of Chapters on Hindu Arithmetic&quot;), in Arabic in 952. The book is well preserved in a single 12th century manuscript, but other than the author&#x27;s name, original year of publication (341 AH, 952/3 AD) and the place (Damascus) we know nothing else about the author: after an extensive survey of extant reference material, mathematical historian Ahmad Salīm Saʿīdān, who discovered the manuscript in 1960, could find no other mention of him. His nickname &quot;al-Uqlīdisī&quot; (&quot;the Euclidean&quot;) was commonly given to people who sold manuscript copies of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;.

In the introductory remarks to his &quot;Arithmetic&quot;, Al-Uqlīdisī claims that he traveled to confer with every arithmetic expert he knew of, and read every previous book he could find, and comprehensively synthesized this previous work while adding his own ideas. The &quot;Arithmetic&quot; describes the main calculation methods of medieval Islamic arithmetic, including finger reckoning, the Greco-Babylonian sexagesimal system commonly used for astronomy, calculations with fractions, and positional decimal calculations using the Hindu–Arabic system performed using the dust board and stylus. It is especially notable for its treatment of decimal fractions, and for showing how to calculate using pen and paper rather than an erasable dust board.

While the Persian mathematician Jamshīd al-Kāshī claimed to have discovered decimal fractions himself in the 15th century, J. Lennart Berggren notes that he was mistaken, as decimal fractions were first used five centuries before him by al-Uqlidisi as early as the 10th century.

A. S. Saidan who studied al-Uqlidisi&#x27;s mathematical treatise in detail wrote:
The most remarkable idea in this work is that of decimal fraction. Al-Uqlidisi uses decimal fractions as such, appreciates the importance of a decimal sign, and suggests a good one. Not al-Kashi (d. 1436/7) who treated decimal fractions in his &quot;Miftah al-Hisab&quot;, but al-Uqlidisi, who lived five centuries earlier, is the first Muslim mathematician so far known to write about decimal fractions.

<text>Ham (in ), according to the Table of Nations in the Book of Genesis, was the second son of Noah and the father of Cush, Mizraim, Phut and Canaan.

Ham&#x27;s descendants are interpreted by Josephus and others as having populated Africa. The Bible refers to Egypt as &quot;the land of Ham&quot; in Psalm 78:51; 105:23, 27; 106:22; 1 Chronicles 4:40.

== Etymology ==
Since the 17th century, a number of suggestions have been made that relate the name &quot;Ham&quot; to a Hebrew word for &quot;burnt&quot;, &quot;black&quot; or &quot;hot&quot;, to the Egyptian word &quot;&quot; for &quot;servant&quot; or the word &quot;&quot; for &quot;majesty&quot; or the Egyptian word &quot;&quot; for &quot;Egypt&quot;. A 2004 review of David Goldenberg&#x27;s &quot;The Curse of Ham: Race and Slavery in Early Judaism, Christianity and Islam&quot; (2003) states that Goldenberg &quot;argues persuasively that the biblical name Ham bears no relationship at all to the notion of blackness and as of now is of unknown etymology.&quot;

== In the Bible ==

 indicates that Noah became the father of Shem, Ham and Japheth at the age of 500 years old, but does not list in detail their specific years. (Noah was 600 years old at the time of the flood in Genesis 7.) An incident involving Ham is related in :
And Noah began to be an husbandman, and planted a vineyard: and he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father&#x27;s nakedness.

And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done unto him. And he said,
:Cursed be Canaan;
:A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
And he said,
:Blessed be the , the God of Shem;
:And let Canaan be his servant.
:God enlarge Japheth,
:And let him dwell in the tents of Shem;
:And let Canaan be his servant.
—Revised Version

== Curse of Canaan ==

What is commonly known as &quot;The Curse of Ham&quot; was not bestowed upon Ham himself; rather, Noah indirectly cursed him through his son Canaan.

The Talmud presents two possible explanations, one attributed to Rabbi Abba Arikha and one to Rabbi Samuel, for what Ham did to Noah to warrant the curse.

According to Abba Arika, Ham castrated Noah on the basis that, since Noah cursed Ham by his fourth son Canaan, Ham must have injured Noah with respect to a fourth son. Emasculating him thus deprived Noah of the possibility of a fourth son.

According to Samuel, Ham sodomized Noah, a judgment that he based on analogy with another biblical incident in which the phrase &quot;and he saw&quot; is used. In it reads, &quot;And when Shechem the son of Hamor saw her (Dinah), he took her and lay with her and defiled her.&quot; With regard to Ham and Noah, Genesis 9 reads, &quot;[22] And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. [23] And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid &quot;it&quot; upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces &quot;were&quot; backward, and they saw not their father&#x27;s nakedness.&quot; According to this argument, similar abuse must have happened each time that the Bible uses the same language. The Talmud concludes that, in fact, &quot;both indignities were perpetrated.&quot;

Although the story can be taken literally, in more recent times, some scholars have suggested that Ham may have had intercourse with his father&#x27;s wife. Under this interpretation, Canaan is cursed as the &quot;product of Ham&#x27;s illicit union.&quot;

===Jubilees===

The chronological scheme of the pseudepigraphal Book of Jubilees has Ham born in the year 1209 Anno Mundi (A.M.) – two years after Shem, three before Japheth, and 99 before the flood. It gives the name of his wife who also survived the flood as &quot;Na&#x27;eltama&#x27;uk&quot;. After his youngest son Canaan was cursed in 1321 A.M., he left Mount Ararat and built a city named for his wife on the south side of the mountain. In 1569 A.M., he received a third division of the earth along with his two brothers for his inheritance: everything west of the Nile River, and to the south of Gadir. In 1639 A.M. when the nations were scattered following the failure of the Tower of Babel, Ham and his children journeyed to their allotment, with the exception of Canaan, who settled in Shem&#x27;s territory, thus receiving another curse.

According to &quot;Jubilees&quot; 10:29–34, this second curse is attributed to Canaan&#x27;s steadfast refusal to join his elder brothers in Ham&#x27;s allotment beyond the Nile, and instead &quot;squatting&quot; within the inheritance of Shem, on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean, the region later promised to Abraham:

And Canaan saw the land of Lebanon to the river of Egypt, that it was very good, and he went not into the land of his inheritance to the west (that is to) the sea, and he dwelt in the land of Lebanon, eastward and westward from the border of Jordan and from the border of the sea. And Ham, his father, and Cush and Mizraim his brothers said unto him: &#x27;Thou hast settled in a land which is not thine, and which did not fall to us by lot: do not do so; for if thou dost do so, thou and thy sons will fall in the land and (be) accursed through sedition; for by sedition ye have settled, and by sedition will thy children fall, and thou shalt be rooted out for ever. Dwell not in the dwelling of Shem; for to Shem and to his sons did it come by their lot. Cursed art thou, and cursed shalt thou be beyond all the sons of Noah, by the curse by which we bound ourselves by an oath in the presence of the holy judge, and in the presence of Noah our father.&#x27; But he did not hearken unto them, and dwelt in the land of Lebanon from Hamath to the entering of Egypt, he and his sons until this day. And for this reason that land is named Canaan. – &quot;Jubilees &quot; 10:29–34.The usurpation theory is similarly believed by Albert Barnes. According to Barnes&#x27; exegesis of Genesis 10:18, the Canaanite clans scattered after the Tower of Babel incident and settled in the southern Levant, where they named the region after themselves. It is unknown whether they were dispersed violently or not. However, Canaan&#x27;s cousin, Nimrod, had a &quot;grasping tendency&quot;, making Barnes believe that Canaan had similar qualities. Thus, Canaan&#x27;s settlement of the southern Levant was interpreted as a violent conquest, with Canaan &quot;seizing upon the country with a high hand&quot;.

==Supposed tomb==
A tomb in Gharibwal, Pakistan, has been claimed by local residents to be the site of Ham&#x27;s burial since 1891, when Hafiz Sham-us-Din of Gulyana, Gujrat, claimed Ham had revealed this to him in a dream. A plaque on the tomb since erected over the gravesite states that Ham, locally revered as a prophet, was buried there after having lived 536 years.

<text>FreeTTS is an open source speech synthesis system written entirely in the Java programming language. It is based upon Flite. FreeTTS is an implementation of Sun&#x27;s Java Speech API.

FreeTTS supports end-of-speech markers. Gnopernicus uses these in a number of places: to know when text should and should not be interrupted, to better concatenate speech, and to sequence speech in different voices. Benchmarks conducted by Sun in 2002 on Solaris showed that FreeTTS ran two to three times faster than Flite at the time.

<text>This Is Your Life is an American reality documentary series broadcast on NBC radio from 1948 to 1952, and on NBC television from 1952 to 1961. It was originally hosted by its creator and producer Ralph Edwards. In the program, the host surprised guests and then took them through a retrospective of their lives in front of an audience, including appearances by colleagues, friends, and family. Edwards revived the show in 1971–1972, and Joseph Campanella hosted a version in 1983. Edwards returned for various specials in the late 1980s.

==Concept==
The idea for &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; arose while Edwards was working on game show &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot;. He had been asked by the United States Army to &quot;do something&quot; for paraplegic soldiers at Birmingham General Army Hospital, a California Army rehabilitation hospital in Van Nuys, Los Angeles (a site later converted into a high school). Edwards chose a &quot;particularly despondent young soldier and hit on the idea of presenting his life on the air, in order to integrate the wreckage of the present with his happier past and the promise of a hopeful future.&quot; Edwards received such positive public feedback from the &quot;capsule narrative&quot; of the soldier he gave on &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; that he developed &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; as a new radio show. In the show, Edwards surprised each guest by narrating a biography of the subject. The show &quot;alternated in presenting the life stories of entertainment personalities and &#x27;ordinary&#x27; people who had contributed in some way to their communities.&quot; The host, consulting his &quot;red book&quot;, narrated while presenting the subject with family members, friends, and others who had affected his or her life.

By the 1950s, the show was aired live before a theater audience. The guests were surprised by Ralph Edwards and confronted by the microphone and cameras. Planning for the broadcast meant that some found out in advance that they were to be featured. For example, Eddie Cantor had a heart condition, so the show&#x27;s producers made sure that he was not surprised.

==Notable guests==

One of the show&#x27;s subjects was Reverend Kiyoshi Tanimoto, a survivor of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Believing he was there for a news interview, Tanimoto was instead met with a highly dramatized depiction of the events including sound effects, dramatic music, and actual footage of the city being destroyed in the bombing, and asked to walk viewers through what happened. During the episode Edwards introduced Tanimoto to Robert A. Lewis, the co-pilot of the &quot;Enola Gay&quot;, the plane that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima. The episode would later be described as &quot;[exemplifying] a number of the ways in which America comes to terms with...its responsibility for Hiroshima. The first of these ways is Disneyfication, the tendency to view Hiroshima as a dramatic spectacle, an exercise in special effects: the ticking clock, the rolling kettledrums, and the image of the mushroom cloud produce an emotional frisson, and little more than that.&quot;

Hanna Bloch Kohner, a Holocaust survivor, was a subject on May 27, 1953.

In February 1953, Lillian Roth, a &quot;topflight torch singer of the Prohibition era&quot; was the subject of the show, &quot;cheerfully admit[ting] that she had been a hopeless drunk for 16 years before being rescued by Alcoholics Anonymous.&quot; Edwards described Roth&#x27;s condition as &quot;impending blindness, an inflamed sinus and a form of alcoholic insanity&quot; and brought on a psychiatrist who had treated her, a brother-in-law &quot;who had paid her bills&quot; and several &quot;glamorous foul-weather friends&quot; such as Lita Grey Chaplin and Ruby Keeler. Roth&#x27;s story became the basis of her 1954 autobiography and 1955 film adaption, &quot;I&#x27;ll Cry Tomorrow&quot;, with Edwards appearing as himself.

Kate Newcomb, a doctor who practiced in a &quot;70-mile circle&quot; around Woodruff, Wisconsin, was the subject of a 1954 episode, bringing attention to her &quot;million pennies&quot; drive to raise funds for a small community hospital; viewers of the episode donated over $112,000 in pennies.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on September 1, 1955, that the Sixth United States Army requested a kinescope of the April 27 episode which honored World War II and Korean War General Mark Clark. The request stated, &quot;We believe that showing of such a program would contribute materially toward the objectives of troop information, since it would create appreciation of the career of an outstanding military leader and further better understanding of certain highlights in the recent history of the Army.&quot;

According to &quot;The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network TV Shows, 1946–Present&quot;, one celebrity that was definitely forbidden was Edwards himself. He supposedly threatened to fire every member of his staff if they ever tried to turn the tables on him and publicly present Edwards&#x27; own life.

In a 1973 episode, Vincent Price was the surprised guest. The show had been planned with his wife Mary while Price was in the UK filming the movie &quot;Theatre of Blood&quot;. By the time he returned to his US home, he had split with his wife and begun a relationship with his co-star from the movie, Coral Browne. Price&#x27;s daughter later revealed that his estranged wife had told him about the show in an attempt to manage any potential fall-out and unbeknownst to the producers, he agreed to act surprised when the show was recorded.

==Reception==

&quot;This Is Your Life&quot; was nominated three times for as &quot;Best Audience Participation, Quiz or Panel Program&quot; at the Emmy Awards, losing in 1953 at the 5th Emmy Awards to &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and sharing the category&#x27;s award with &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; at the Emmys in 1954 and 1955. It also fared well in the ratings during the 1950s, finishing at #11 in 1953–1954, #12 in 1954–1955, #26 in 1955–1956, #19 in 1957–1958 and #29 in 1958–1959.

By October 1960, &quot;Time&quot; magazine was calling &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; &quot;the most sickeningly sentimental show on the air&quot;; it cited a May 1960 episode on &quot;Queens housewife and mother&quot; Elizabeth Hahn as evidence that the show had &quot;run through every faded actress still able to cry on cue&quot; and had instead &quot;turned to ordinary people as subjects for its weekly, &#x27;true-to-life&#x27; biographies.&quot; The episode on Hahn was also cited as an example of the limited research that the show was doing on its guests. The show had presented Hahn as &quot;devoted to her husband and so dedicated to her children that she had worked as a chambermaid, waitress and cook to further their education and keep them off the streets&quot;, ignoring details such as that Hahn, on the advice of her rabbi, had brought her daughter into a magistrate&#x27;s court as a delinquent, and that before the episode was broadcast, Hahn&#x27;s husband had sued her for divorce. Virginia Graham, in her autobiography, noted that the show had been characterized as a maudlin invasion of privacy.

==Reruns and revivals==
In the late 1980s, Edwards made many episodes that featured celebrities available for re-broadcasting: American Movie Classics aired them for several years, accompanying them with &quot;screenings of movies from studio-era Hollywood.&quot;

Edwards revived the series twice in syndication, the first in 1971 with Edwards again as host, and in 1983 with Joseph Campanella. Both failed to capture the magic of the original series, mostly due to the series being filmed or taped and, in the case of the 1971–72 version, some stations that aired it gave away the surprise elements in ads and promos for the show. During the late 1980s, Edwards hosted a few single prime time network airings of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, most memorably an episode featuring Betty White and Dick Van Dyke. Pat Sajak hosted an episode in November 1993 on NBC where Roy Scheider and Kathie Lee Gifford were the honorees, and Edwards made a cameo at the beginning, then appeared again when Kathie&#x27;s work as a singer on the 70s version of &quot;Name that Tune&quot;, which Edwards produced, was mentioned. Actress Angie Dickinson was supposed to have been one of the two celebrities honoured in the special, and was lured under the pretext of being interviewed for a special about director Brian de Palma, but when host Sajak surprised her with the typical &quot;this is your life!&quot; greeting to kick off the show she refused to participate and walked out. She later said that she had previously been approached about being a guest on the show and had declined, and that the main reason she refused to participate was that she didn&#x27;t look good crying.

In November 2005, ABC announced that it was developing a new version of the show, to be hosted by Regis Philbin. Coincidentally, creator, Ralph Edwards, died not long after the announcement was made. In August 2006, Philbin decided not to renew his contract with the show (he was committed to hosting &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; on NBC). ABC announced it was considering moving forward with another host in 2006, but this never came to fruition.

In October 2008, &quot;Survivor&quot; producer Mark Burnett signed a deal with Ralph Edwards Productions to produce an updated version. This also did not come to fruition.

In the Taiwanese variety show &quot;Super Sunday&quot;, the second half of each episode has a &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;-style segment where a celebrity or a local discussed their past followed by a cinematic re-enactment (usually exaggerated or serious) then a remote segment to search for the individual. However, the final result for each segment may or may not be successful.

==Parodies==

* The show was parodied in 1954 by &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;, as &quot;This Is Your Story&quot;. Carl Reiner played the host, who surprises an uncooperative audience member played by Sid Caesar.
* In 1955, Warner Bros. animator Friz Freleng did a sendup called &quot;This Is a Life?&quot;, hosted by Elmer Fudd and featured Bugs Bunny as the guest of honor. The cartoon also featured Daffy Duck, Granny and Yosemite Sam.
* Bob &amp; Ray issued a 45 rpm record with a routine called &quot;This Is Your Bed (You Made It, Now Lie in It)&quot; on Coral (catalog number 9-61338) in 1955.
* A 1960 episode of &quot;Walt Disney Presents&quot;, &quot;This Is Your Life, Donald Duck&quot;, was a parody tribute to Donald Duck, hosted by Jiminy Cricket.
* There was a recurring segment on the children&#x27;s program &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;Here is Your Life&quot;, which followed the show&#x27;s format but featured inanimate objects — a loaf of bread, an oak tree, a tooth, a house, a shoe, and a carton of eggs — as its guests. Like most of the game show parodies on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, the show was hosted by the Muppet character Guy Smiley; seven sketches were produced between 1972 and 1990. During Season 26 (1994–1995), two others were hosted by Sonny Friendly and the sketch was retitled as &quot;The New Here is Your Life&quot;, featuring a storybook and a glass of milk as honorees. Another variant, &quot;This Is Your Story&quot; (1982), was a one-shot featuring Guy honoring Muppet Character Forgetful Jones.
* In 1976, the game show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; parodied the show in one of its Showcase skits, called &quot;This Is Your Strife,&quot; featuring bloopers involving model Janice Pennington. The cast had previously rehearsed a fake skit with Pennington, then sprung the &quot;... Strife&quot; skit on her as a surprise.
* As a part of a 1987 &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; 40th-anniversary retrospective special, Monty Hall and Buffalo Bob Smith imagined, as a way to celebrate Howdy Doody&#x27;s birthday, a spoof of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; called &quot;Your Happiest Days&quot;.
* The WWE spoofed &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; three times with Mick Foley as the host. The purpose of these segments was to bring out individuals of the guest&#x27;s past that embarrassed them. The most notable of these segments occurred on September 27, 1999, with The Rock. The first of these spoofs is still the highest TV rating for a non-wrestling match in &quot;Raw&#x27;s&quot; history.
* In the early 1990s, McGruff the Crime Dog was honored by Ralph Edwards in a PSA from the Ad Council with National Crime Prevention Council.
* In Season 4 of &quot;The Good Place&quot;, a parody takes place in the show&#x27;s afterlife setting, called &quot;That Was Your Life.&quot;

<doc id="426380" wikidata="Q53834" url="?curid=426380" title="Kiyoshi Kurosawa">
<text>is a Japanese film director, screenwriter, film critic, author, actor, and professor at Tokyo University of the Arts.

Noted for his psychological films that often focus on ambiguous narratives and on their characters&#x27; inner turmoils and quests for meaning and connections, he is best known for his contributions to psychological horror and Japanese horror, notably his acclaimed 1997 film &quot;Cure&quot;, although he has also worked in a variety of other genres. While most of his work has been in Japanese, two of his films, &quot;Daguerrotype&quot; (2016) and &quot;Serpent&#x27;s Path&quot; (2024; a remake of his own 1998 film of the same name), were in French.

==Early life and education ==
Born in Kobe on July 19, 1955, Kiyoshi Kurosawa started making films about his life in high school.

He studied at Rikkyo University in Tokyo under the guidance of prominent film critic Shigehiko Hasumi, where he began making 8mm films.

He is not related to director Akira Kurosawa.

== Career ==
Kurosawa began directing commercially in the 1980s, working on pink films and low-budget V-Cinema (direct-to-video) productions such as formula yakuza films. In 1981, his 8mm film &quot;Shigarami Gakuen&quot; (しがらみ学園) was nominated for the Oshima Prize at the PFF (Pia Film Festival). In 1983, after he worked with Shinji Soumai, he released his first feature film &quot;Kandagawa Pervert Wars&quot; (1983). He became popular after &quot;The Excitement of the Do-Re-Mi-Fa Girl&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Guard from Underground&quot; (1992).

In the early 1990s, Kurosawa won a scholarship to the Sundance Institute by submitting his original screen play &quot;Charisma.&quot; Then, he was able to study filmmaking in the United States, although he had been directing for nearly ten years professionally.

Kurosawa first achieved international acclaim with his 1997 crime thriller film &quot;Cure&quot;. A year later, he completed two thrillers back-to-back, &quot;Serpent&#x27;s Path&quot; and &quot;Eyes of the Spider&quot;, both of which shared the same premise (a father taking revenge for his child&#x27;s murder) and lead actor (Show Aikawa) but spun entirely different stories. In March 1999, the Hong Kong International Film Festival presented his first retrospective, a five-title-program including &quot;The Excitement of the Do-re-mi fa Girls&quot;, &quot;The Guard from Underground&quot;, &quot;Serpent&#x27;s Path&quot;, &quot;Eyes of the Spider&quot;, and &quot;License to Live&quot;.

Kurosawa followed up &quot;Cure&quot; with a semi-sequel in 1999 with &quot;Charisma&quot;, a detective film starring Kōji Yakusho. In 2000, &quot;Seance&quot;, Kurosawa&#x27;s adaptation of the novel &quot;Seance on a Wet Afternoon&quot; by Mark McShane, premiered on Kansai TV. It also starred Yakusho, as well as Jun Fubuki (the two had appeared together in &quot;Charisma&quot; as well). In 2001, he directed the horror film &quot;Pulse&quot;. Kurosawa released &quot;Bright Future&quot;, starring Tadanobu Asano, Joe Odagiri and Tatsuya Fuji, in 2003. He followed this with another digital feature, &quot;Doppelganger&quot;, later the same year. Both &quot;Bright Future and Doppelganger&quot; have nominated for the Cannes Film Festivals

In 2005, Kurosawa returned with &quot;Loft&quot;, his first love story since &quot;Seance&quot;. Another horror film, &quot;Retribution&quot;, followed in the next year. With his 2008 film, &quot;Tokyo Sonata&quot;, Kurosawa was considered to step &quot;out of his usual horror genre and into family drama.&quot;

He has written a novelization of his own film &quot;Pulse&quot;, as well as a history of horror cinema with Makoto Shinozaki.

In September 2012, it was announced that he would direct &quot;1905&quot;, a film starring Tony Leung Chiu-Wai, Shota Matsuda and Atsuko Maeda. In February 2013, it was announced that production of the film had been cancelled before filming could start.

Kurosawa directed a 2012 five-part television drama &quot;Penance&quot;. &quot;Beautiful 2013&quot;, an anthology film featuring Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful New Bay Area Project&quot;, screened at the Hong Kong International Film Festival in 2013.

Kurosawa&#x27;s next feature film &quot;Real&quot;, which stars Takeru Sato and Haruka Ayase, was released in 2013. He won the Best Director award at the 8th Rome Film Festival for &quot;Seventh Code&quot; later that year.

His 2015 film &quot;Journey to the Shore&quot; was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival where he won the prize for Best Director.

In 2016, his thriller &quot;Creepy&quot; premiered at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival. The film marked Kurosawa&#x27;s first cinematic return to the horror genre since 2006.

His 2017 film &quot;Before We Vanish&quot; was screened in the Un Certain Regard category at the Cannes Film Festival.

His 2019 film &quot;To the Ends of the Earth&quot; was screened as the closing film in the Piazza Grande program of the 72nd Locarno Film Festival.

In 2020, Kurosawa won the Silver Lion for Best Direction at the 77th Venice International Film Festival for his film &quot;Wife of a Spy&quot;.

In December 2023, alongside 50 other filmmakers, Kurosawa signed an open letter published in &quot;Libération&quot; demanding a ceasefire and an end to the killing of civilians amid the 2023 Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, and for a humanitarian corridor into Gaza to be established for humanitarian aid, and the release of hostages.

==Style and influences==

Kurosawa&#x27;s directing style has been compared to those of Stanley Kubrick and Andrei Tarkovsky, though he has never expressly listed those directors as influences. In an interview, he claimed that Alfred Hitchcock and Yasujirō Ozu contributed to shaping his personal vision of the medium. He has also expressed admiration for American film directors such as Don Siegel, Sam Peckinpah, Robert Aldrich, Richard Fleischer, and Tobe Hooper.

In a 2009 interview with IFC, Kurosawa talked about the reason why he has cast the actor Kōji Yakusho in many of his films: &quot;He has similar values and sensitivities. We’re from the same generation. That’s a big reason why I enjoy working with him on the set.&quot;

According to Tim Palmer, Kurosawa&#x27;s films occupy a peculiar position between the materials of mass genre, on the one hand, and esoteric or intellectual abstraction, on the other. They also clearly engage with issues of environmental critique, given Kurosawa&#x27;s preference for shooting in decaying open spaces, abandoned (and often condemned) buildings, and in places rife with toxins, pestilence and entropy.

In an interview with the Tokyo Art University, where he is a professor, Kurosawa talks about not wanting his directorial style to be too fixed. The interviewer makes reference to Kurosawa&#x27;s versatility when they talk about Clint Eastwood; Kurosawa says he admires people who can do many things and that he doesn&#x27;t box himself into one style or one theme. When asked what he wants to try next, he answered: &quot;The next thing I want to do is something I have never done.&quot; Kurosawa also mentions that he has seen many films since he was young, and that he knows there are many great films from around the world. Those films motivate him to be a better filmmaker; he always asks himself how to make films that will be memorable for a long time.

In the same article by the Tokyo Art University, Kurosawa names film critic Hasumi Shigehiko as a mentor and early influence in his filmmaking career. Much of Hasumi&#x27;s influence would go on to shape the core of Kurosawa&#x27;s filmography. Kurosawa met Hasumi in University, where he was one of the few students to finish his course, and credits Hasumi with teaching him that film is worth dedicating your entire life to. Hasumi and Kurosawa believe that every element of the film matters and should be meticulously planned. Kurosawa has also stated that one of his goals as a filmmaker is to share Hasumi&#x27;s teachings.

<doc id="426381" wikidata="Q164521" url="?curid=426381" title="George Best">
<text>George Best (22 May 1946 – 25 November 2005) was a Northern Irish professional footballer who played as a winger, spending most of his club career at Manchester United. A skillful dribbler, he is considered one of the greatest players of all time, along with being considered one of the most talented to play. He was named European Footballer of the Year in 1968 and came fifth in the FIFA Player of the Century vote. Best received plaudits for his playing style, which combined pace, skill, balance, feints, goalscoring and the ability to get past defenders. His style of play captured the public&#x27;s imagination, and in 1999 he was on the six-man shortlist for the BBC&#x27;s Sports Personality of the Century. He was an inaugural inductee into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002.

Born in Belfast, Best began his club career in England with Manchester United, with the scout who had spotted his talent at the age of 15 sending a telegram to manager Matt Busby which read: &quot;I think I&#x27;ve found you a genius&quot;. After making his debut at age 17, he scored 179 goals in 470 appearances over 11 years and was the club&#x27;s top goalscorer in the league for five consecutive seasons. He won two League titles, two Charity Shields and the European Cup with the club.

In international football, Best was capped 37 times for Northern Ireland between 1964 and 1977. A combination of the team&#x27;s performance and his lack of fitness in 1982 meant that he never played in the finals of a major tournament. He considered his international career as being &quot;recreational football&quot;, with the expectations placed on a smaller nation in Northern Ireland being much less than with his club. He is regarded as one of the greatest players never to have played at a World Cup. The Irish Football Association described him as the &quot;greatest player to ever pull on the green shirt of Northern Ireland&quot;.

With his handsomeness, dark Beatle mop-top hair and playboy lifestyle, Best became one of the first media celebrity footballers, earning the nickname &quot;o Quinto Beatle&quot; by Portuguese press reporters after a stand-out performance for Manchester United in Lisbon in March 1966. However, his extravagant lifestyle led to various personal problems, most notably alcoholism, from which he suffered for the rest of his life. These issues affected him on and off the field, often causing controversy. Although conscious of his problems, he made light of them and was known for his intelligence and wit on the subject during periods of sobriety: &quot;I spent a lot of money on booze, birds, and fast cars – the rest I just squandered&quot;. After football, he spent some time as a football analyst, but his financial and health problems continued into his retirement. He died in 2005, aged 59, from complications from the immunosuppressive drugs he needed to take after a liver transplant in 2002.

== Early years and family ==

George Best was the first child of Anglo-Irish parents, Richard &quot;Dickie&quot; Best (1919–2008) and Anne Withers (1922–1978). He was born on 22 May 1946 and grew up in Cregagh, east Belfast. Best was raised in the Free Presbyterian faith. His father was a member of the Orange Order and as a boy George carried the strings of the banner in his local Cregagh lodge. In his autobiography, Best mentioned how important the Order was to his family. Best had four sisters, Carol, Barbara, Julie and Grace, and one brother, Ian Busby Best.

Best&#x27;s mother Anne died from alcoholism-related cardiovascular disease in 1978, at the age of 55. Best&#x27;s father died on 16 April 2008, at the age of 88, in the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald, Northern Ireland.

In 1957, the academically gifted Best passed the 11-plus and went to Grosvenor High School, but he soon played truant as the school specialised in rugby union. Best then moved to Lisnasharragh Secondary School, reuniting him with friends from primary school and allowing him to focus on football. He played for Cregagh Boys Club. He grew up supporting Glentoran and Wolverhampton Wanderers.

== Club career ==
=== Manchester United ===
At the age of 15 Best was discovered in Belfast by Manchester United scout Bob Bishop, whose telegram to United manager Matt Busby read: &quot;I think I&#x27;ve found you a genius.&quot; His local club Glentoran had previously rejected him for being &quot;too small and light&quot;. Best was subsequently given a trial and signed up by United&#x27;s chief scout Joe Armstrong. His first time moving to the club, Best quickly became homesick and stayed for only two days before going back home to Northern Ireland. He returned to Manchester and spent two years as an amateur, as English clubs were not allowed to take Northern Irish players on as apprentices. He was given a job as an errand boy on the Manchester Ship Canal, allowing him to train with the club twice a week.

Best made his First Division debut, aged 17, on 14 September 1963 against West Bromwich Albion at Old Trafford in a 1–0 victory. He then dropped back into the reserves, before scoring his first goal for the first team in his second appearance in a 5–1 win over Burnley on 28 December. Manager Matt Busby then kept Best in the team, and by the end of the 1963–64 season, he had made 26 appearances, scoring six goals. Manchester United finished second, four points behind Liverpool.

They reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where a defeat to West Ham United cost Best the chance to break a record. In the final Preston North End&#x27;s Howard Kendall became the youngest ever player in a FA Cup Final – he shared the same birth date as Best. That same season, Best captained the Manchester United side that won the 1964 FA Youth Cup, the sixth FA Youth Cup won under the management of Jimmy Murphy, and the first since the 1958 Munich air disaster.

Though opponents would often use rough play to try to stifle his technical ability, Busby ensured that &quot;fierce, sometimes brutal&quot; training sessions left Best well used to coping with tough challenges. In the 1964–65 season, his first full season as a first team regular, Best helped Manchester United to claim the league title. A 1–0 victory at Elland Road proved decisive as the title race came down to goal average between the &quot;Red Devils&quot; and bitter rivals Leeds United. Leeds managed to gain some measure of revenge though, by knocking Manchester United out of the FA Cup at the semi-final stage. Over the course of the campaign Best contributed 14 goals in 59 competitive games. He scored the opening goal of the 1965 FA Charity Shield at Old Trafford, which ended in a 2–2 draw with Liverpool.

The rising star of English football, Best was catapulted to superstar status at the age of 19, when he scored two goals in a European Cup quarter-final match against Benfica at the Estádio da Luz on 9 March 1966. His impressive stand-out display allied with his dark Beatle mop-top hair, the Portuguese media dubbed him &quot;O Quinto Beatle&quot; (&quot;the fifth Beatle&quot;), and on the team&#x27;s return to England, Best was photographed on the airport tarmac in his new sombrero with the headline, &quot;El Beatle&quot;. His talent and showmanship made him a crowd and media favourite, and he went from being headline news in the back pages to the front pages.

Other nicknames included the &quot;Belfast Boy&quot;, and he was often referred to as &quot;Georgie&quot;, or &quot;Geordie&quot; in his native Belfast. However United failed to win any major honours in the 1965–66 season, and Best was injured from 26 March onwards, with a twisted knee following a bad tackle from a Preston North End player. United staff claimed it was light ligament damage, to keep Best on the field for the rest of the campaign. He had little faith in the United medical staff, and so he secretly saw Glentoran&#x27;s physiotherapist, who readjusted his ligaments in a painful procedure. His last game of the season, his knee strapped-up, came on 13 April, and ended in a 2–0 defeat to Partizan Belgrade at Partizan Stadium.

The 1966–67 season was again successful, as Manchester United claimed the league title by four points. Best stated that &quot;if the championship was decided on home games we would win it every season. This time our away games made the difference. We got into the right frame of mind.&quot; An ever-present all season long, he scored 10 goals in 45 games. He then helped the &quot;Red Devils&quot; to share the Charity Shield with a 3–3 draw with FA Cup winners Tottenham Hotspur. It was the first game to be broadcast in colour on British television.

Best scored twice against rivals Liverpool in a 2–0 win at Anfield, and claimed a hat-trick over Newcastle United in a 6–0 home win on the penultimate league game of the season. However a home defeat to hated local rivals Manchester City proved costly, as City claimed the league title with a two-point lead over United. Yet the 1967–68 season was remembered by United fans for the European Cup win. After disposing of Maltese Hibernians, United advanced past Yugoslavian Sarajevo with a 2–1 home win – Best assisted John Aston for the first and scored the second himself, and was described by Geoffrey Green of &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;the centrepiece of the chessboard ... a player full of fantasy; a player who lent magic to what might have been whimsy&quot;. 

In the quarter-finals, United advanced past Polish club Górnik Zabrze 2–1 on aggregate, having held on to their aggregate lead in freezing temperatures in front of 105,000 at Silesian Stadium. Despite losing the away tie 1–0, Best described the defeat as &quot;one of our best-ever performances, given all the unwelcome circumstances&quot;. Facing six times champions Real Madrid in the semi-finals, Best scored the only goal of the home fixture with a 15-yard strike that Alex Stepney described as one of Best&#x27;s finest goals. In the tie at the Bernabéu, Best was marked effectively by Manuel Sanchís Martínez, but on the one time Best got the better of him he made a telling pass to Bill Foulkes, who calmly found the net, to level the game at 3–3 and to win the aggregate tie 4–3.

Days after returning to England, as the First Division&#x27;s joint top-scorer, level on 28 goals with Southampton&#x27;s Ron Davies, Best was presented with the FWA Footballer of the Year award, becoming the youngest ever recipient. Facing United in the European Cup Final at Wembley were Benfica. While his teammates rested, Best found &quot;a novel way to relax&quot; before the big game by sleeping with &quot;a particular young lady called Sue&quot;. The game went into extra-time, and just three minutes into extra-time Best went on a mazy run and beat goalkeeper José Henrique with a dummy, before rolling the ball into the net. Two further goals from Brian Kidd and Bobby Charlton settled the tie at 4–1. The victory was not only the pinnacle of Best&#x27;s career, but arguably Manchester United&#x27;s greatest achievement, considering the Munich air disaster had wiped out most of the Busby Babes just ten years previously. Best also won the Ballon d&#x27;Or in 1968 after receiving more votes than Bobby Charlton, Dragan Džajić and Franz Beckenbauer. This meant that he had won the three major honours in club football at the age of just 22, the league title, European Cup, and European Player of the Year award. After this, his steady decline began.
The &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; of Best, Law and Charlton were still as effective as ever in the 1968–69 campaign. Although, it became obvious that the club&#x27;s new recruits were not up to scratch as United dropped to 11th in the league before Busby announced his retirement. Best later said that &quot;I increasingly had the feeling that I was carrying the team at times on the pitch.&quot; He scored 22 goals in 55 games, though only he and Denis Law scored more than six league goals. In the Intercontinental Cup, fans and players alike looked forward to seeing United take on Argentine opposition Estudiantes de La Plata over the course of two legs. However Best said &quot;no one tackled harder or dirtier than this Argentinian team&quot; as a 1–0 defeat at the Estadio Camilo Cichero was followed by a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford. In the home tie, Best was kicked and spat on by José Hugo Medina, and both players were sent off after Best reacted with a punch. Despite their poor league form, United managed to reach the semi-finals of the European Cup (they had a relatively easy run in getting past Ireland&#x27;s Waterford United, Belgium&#x27;s Anderlecht, and Austria&#x27;s Rapid Wien) where they were knocked out 2–1 on aggregate by A.C. Milan following a 2–0 defeat at the San Siro; Milan goalkeeper Fabio Cudicini was the hero after keeping United to only one goal at Old Trafford.

United improved slightly under new boss Wilf McGuinness, but still only managed an eighth-place finish in the 1969–70 season. Best hit 23 goals, including an FA Cup record six goals in an 8–2 win over Northampton Town in a mud-bath at the County Ground on 7 February 1970. Best&#x27;s sixth goal saw him go one on one with Northampton goalkeeper Kim Book. Best made a feint to go right which put Book on his backside, before he went left and walked the ball into the net. Book states: Best&#x27;s six goal performance earned him an invitation to No 10 Downing Street from UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who had also regularly written fan letters to him. In 2002 the British public voted Best&#x27;s record breaking performance No. 26 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments. Busby returned as manager in December 1970, though the 1970–71 season also ended without a trophy. Best began to get into trouble with his discipline: he was fined by the Football Association for receiving three bookings for misconduct, and he was suspended by United for two weeks after missing his train to Stamford Bridge so as to spend a weekend with actress Sinéad Cusack.

New manager Frank O&#x27;Farrell led United to an 8th-place finish in 1971–72. Highlights for Best included hat-tricks against West Ham United and Southampton, as well as a goal against Sheffield United that came after he beat four defenders in a mazy run. However, he was also sent off against Chelsea, was the subject of death threats, and failed to turn up for training for a whole week in January as he instead spent his time with Miss Great Britain 1971, Carolyn Moore. On 17 November, he was the subject of Eamonn Andrews&#x27;s biographical television show &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; when he was surprised at a central London restaurant. He would be the subject for a second time in 2003 when Michael Aspel surprised him at Teddington Studios. With 27 goals in 54 appearances, Best finished as the club&#x27;s top-scorer for the sixth – and final – consecutive season. Best then announced his retirement from football, but nevertheless turned up for pre-season training, and continued to play.

United&#x27;s decline continued in the 1972–73 season, as Best was part of the &#x27;old guard clique&#x27; that barely talked to the newer, less talented players. Frustrated with the club&#x27;s decline, Best went missing in December to party at the London nightclubs. He was suspended, and transfer-listed at a value of £300,000. After O&#x27;Farrell was replaced as manager by Tommy Docherty, Best announced his retirement for a second time. He resumed training on 27 April.

Best&#x27;s last competitive game for the club was on 1 January 1974 against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road, which United lost 3–0. He failed to turn up for training three days later and was dropped by Docherty, though he claimed Docherty was deceitful with him. Best was arrested and charged with stealing a fur coat, passport, and cheque book from Marjorie Wallace, but was later cleared of all charges. United went on to suffer relegation into the Second Division in 1973–74.

Best played at United when shirt numbers were assigned to positions, and not the player. When Best played at right wing, as he famously did during the later stages of the 1966 and 1968 European Cups, he donned the number 7. As a left winger, where he played exclusively in his debut season and nearly all of the 1971–72 campaign, he wore the number 11. Best wore the number 8 shirt at inside right on occasion throughout the 1960s, but for more than half of his matches during 1970–71. He was playing at inside left (wearing the number 10) in 1972 when he famously walked out on United the first time but was back in the number 11 for the autumn of 1973 before leaving for good. Best even wore the number 9 jersey once for United, with Bobby Charlton injured, on 22 March 1969 at Old Trafford, scoring the only goal in a 1–0 win over Sheffield Wednesday. In total Best made 474 appearances for Manchester United in all competitions from 1963 to 1974, and scored 181 goals. Over the next decade he went into an increasingly rapid decline, drifting between several clubs, including spells in South Africa, the Republic of Ireland, the United States, Scotland, and Australia.

=== Later years ===

Playing only five competitive matches for Jewish Guild in South Africa, Best endured criticism for missing several training sessions. During his short time there, he was the main draw attracting thousands of spectators to the matches.

In 1975, Best played three matches for Stockport County in the Fourth Division. He had a brief spell at Cork Celtic from December 1975 to January 1976. He made his League of Ireland debut against Drogheda United at Flower Lodge on 28 December. He played only three league games, the others against Bohemians and Shelbourne, but despite attracting big crowds he failed to score or impress. Being on a rolling contract with Cork his failure to show for a game saw him being dropped and subsequently leaving the club.

He had a brief resurgence in form with Second Division club Fulham from 1976–78, showing that, although he had lost some of his pace, he retained his skills. His time with the &quot;Cottagers&quot; is particularly remembered for a match against Hereford United on 25 September 1976 in which he jokingly tackled his own teammate, and old drinking mate, Rodney Marsh. Best and Marsh were drawn to the club by the presence of England World Cup winning captain Bobby Moore, and they were involved in exuberant goal celebrations.

Best played for three clubs in the United States: Los Angeles Aztecs, Fort Lauderdale Strikers and later San Jose Earthquakes; he also played for the Detroit Express on a European tour. Best was a success on the field, scoring 15 goals in 24 games in his first season with the Aztecs and named as the NASL&#x27;s best midfielder in his second. He and manager Ken Adam opened &quot;Bestie&#x27;s Beach Club&quot; (now called &quot;The Underground&quot; after the London subway system) in Hermosa Beach, California in the 1970s, and continued to operate it until the 1990s.

Best caused a stir when he returned to the UK to play for the Scottish club Hibernian. The club was suffering a decline in fortunes and was heading for relegation from the Premier Division, before Best was signed on a &quot;pay per play&quot; basis after the club chairman, Tom Hart, received a tip-off from an &quot;Edinburgh Evening News&quot; reporter that he was available. Even though Best failed to save Hibs from relegation, gates increased dramatically, and the attendance quadrupled for his first match at Easter Road. One infamous incident saw Best initially sacked by Hibs after he went on a massive drinking session with the French rugby team, who were in Edinburgh to play Scotland. He was brought back a week later. In August 1982, he played 20 minutes for Scone Thistle against Scone Amateurs; the appearance fee he received helped to pay off an income tax bill.

He returned to the US to play for the San Jose Earthquakes in what was officially described as a &quot;loan&quot;, though he only managed a handful of appearances for Hibs in the First Division in the following season. He returned one last time to Easter Road in 1984, for Jackie McNamara&#x27;s testimonial match against Newcastle United. In his third season in the States, Best scored once in 12 appearances. His moves to Fort Lauderdale and San Jose were also unhappy, as his off-field demons began to take control of his life again. After failing to agree terms with Bolton Wanderers in 1981, he was invited as a guest player and played three matches for two Hong Kong First Division teams (Sea Bee and Rangers) in 1982. At HK Rangers he played alongside his former Northern Ireland teammate Derek Spence. While in Hong Kong, Best also played darts for a team called Presstuds, made up of a combination of professional footballers and sports journalists.

In late 1982, AFC Bournemouth manager Don Megson signed the 36-year-old Best for the Third Division side, and he remained there until the end of the 1982–83 season, when he retired from football at the age of 37. Best played in a friendly for Newry Town against Shamrock Rovers in August 1983, before ending his professional career exactly 20 years after joining Manchester United with a brief four-match stint playing for the Brisbane Lions in the Australian National Soccer League during the 1983 season. He also was a guest player for an exhibition match between Dee Why Football Club and Manly Warringah held on 27 July 1983; Dee Why won the match 2–1, with Best having scored the winning goal. On 29 October 1984, Best played as a special guest for Reading against the New Zealand national team in a friendly game, alongside 1966 World Cup winner Martin Peters. Reading were defeated 2–1.

On 8 August 1988, a testimonial match was held for Best at Windsor Park. Among the crowd were Sir Matt Busby, Jimmy Murphy, and Bob Bishop, the scout who discovered Best, while those playing included Osvaldo Ardiles, Johan Neeskens, Pat Jennings and Liam Brady. Best scored twice, one goal from outside the box, the other from the penalty spot.

==International career==

Best was capped 37 times for Northern Ireland, scoring nine goals. Of his nine international goals, four were scored against Cyprus and one each against Albania, England, Scotland, Switzerland and Turkey. Largely surrounded by teammates of lesser ability with Northern Ireland than with his club and lower expectations as a result, Best considered his international career as being &quot;recreational football&quot;. He is regarded as one of the greatest players never to have played at a World Cup, and like his namesake, Liberia star George Weah, he was “hamstrung in World Cup terms by hailing from a global minnow”.

On 15 May 1971, Best scored possibly the most famous &quot;goal&quot; of his career at Windsor Park in Belfast against England. As Gordon Banks, the English goalkeeper, released the ball in the air in order to kick the ball downfield, Best managed to kick the ball first, which sent the ball high over their heads and heading towards the open goal. Best outpaced Banks and headed the ball into the empty goal, but the goal was disallowed by referee Alistair Mackenzie.

Best continued to be selected for Northern Ireland throughout the 1970s, despite his fluctuating form and off field problems. Dutch captain Johan Cruyff commented: &quot;What he [Best] had was unique, you can&#x27;t coach it&quot;.

Best was considered briefly by manager Billy Bingham for the 1982 World Cup, but at the age of 35, with his football skills dulled by age and drink (and five years having passed since his last cap), he was not selected for the Northern Ireland squad. A proponent of a United Ireland football team, in 2005 Best stated: &quot;I&#x27;ve always thought that at any given time both the Republic and Northern Ireland have had some great world class players. I still hope that in my lifetime it happens.&quot;

== Style of play ==

A highly skilful winger, considered by several pundits to be one of the greatest dribblers in the history of the sport, Best received plaudits for his playing style, which combined pace, skill, balance, feints, two-footedness, goalscoring and the ability to get past defenders. Pelé declared that Best was the greatest footballer he&#x27;d ever seen. Recalling Best&#x27;s career and style of play, sports writer Patrick Barclay said: &quot;In terms of ability he was the world&#x27;s best footballer of all time. He could do almost anything – technically, speed, complete mastery of not only the ball but his own body. You could saw his legs away and he still wouldn&#x27;t fall because his balance was uncanny, almost supernatural. Heading ability, passing ability, I mean it goes without saying the dribbling – he could beat anybody in any way he chose. For fun he&#x27;d play a one-two off the opponent&#x27;s shins.&quot;
Although Best was mostly renowned for his dribbling skills, he also drew praise for his ability as a creator; in regard to this ability, &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; reader Tony Dove commented: &quot;I only had the opportunity to see George play once in person – Man U played a tour game in Auckland, New Zealand, late in the 60s. His brilliance was simply dazzling – player after player from the New Zealand national team queued up to try to tackle him and he gave them all dancing lessons. I clearly remember one run, starting almost from the goal-line, from a roll-out by Stepney, when he evaded every player in the NZ team, one after the other, until he reached the opposite end of the pitch and produced a perfectly floated centre for Charlton&#x27;s head. His grace, agility and ball skills were only eclipsed by his unselfish passing – many love to remark on his goal scoring but he was prodigious as the set-up man. On the field you couldn&#x27;t ask for a better football role-model. Let the man pass with what dignity remains to him. Remember him at his best.&quot;

In an interview, Manchester United&#x27;s Alex Stepney said, &quot;Best would knock the ball on to the goalkeeper&#x27;s shin, who would be rushing towards this feet to close down the angle, and the ball would bounce back to him and he would score. No one has been able to emulate that in football. Not only did he do it in training but he did it against Manchester United&#x27;s arch rivals Liverpool at Anfield.&quot;

== Personal life ==

During his early years at Old Trafford, Best was a shy teenager who passed his free time in snooker halls. However, he later became known for his long hair, good looks and extravagant celebrity lifestyle, and appeared on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in 1965. He had a brief relationship with actress Sinéad Cusack in 1971.

He opened a nightclub called &quot;Slack Alice&quot; on Bootle Street in Manchester in 1973 and owned restaurants in the city including &quot;Oscars&quot;, on the site of the old Waldorf Hotel. He also owned fashion boutiques, in partnership with Manchester City player Mike Summerbee. Best&#x27;s cousin, Gary Reid, a member of the Ulster Defence Association, was killed in 1974 during an episode of serious rioting in east Belfast.

Best married Angela MacDonald-Janes on 24 January 1978 at Candlelight Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, having met her in the United States when Best was playing for the Los Angeles Aztecs in 1976. Their son, Calum, was born in 1981. They separated in 1982 and divorced in 1986.

He married Alex Pursey in 1995 in Kensington and Chelsea, London. They divorced in 2004 with no children. In 2004, she alleged that Best was violent towards her at times during their marriage, an issue that was covered in Best&#x27;s authorised 1998 biography &quot;Bestie&quot; in which Alex claimed that Best punched her in the face on more than one occasion. Earlier in the book it is revealed that he struck another of his girlfriends at least once and was arrested and charged with assault on a waitress, Stevie Sloniecka, in November 1972, when he fractured her nose in Reuben&#x27;s nightclub, Manchester. He was successfully defended when the case reached court in January 1973 by barrister George Carman QC, a close drinking companion of Best, as acknowledged in his book, &quot;Scoring at Half Time&quot;.

At the peak of his career in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Best advertised Cookstown sausages on television with the phrase &quot;the Best family sausages&quot;. In 2007 a memorial plaque was placed outside the pork factory in the County Tyrone town. In the early 1970s, Best also advertised eggs, under the campaign &quot;E for B and Georgie Best,&quot; both in print and on TV, where &quot;E for B&quot; was short for &quot;Eggs for Breakfast.&quot;

Best had a cameo as himself in the 1971 British comedy film &quot;Percy&quot;. In 1984, he made a fitness album with Mary Stävin called &quot;Shape Up and Dance&quot;. The Farm&#x27;s video for their 1992 cover version of The Human League&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot; featured Best mouthing the chorus. A biographical film entitled &quot;Best&quot; was released in May 2000, with John Lynch portraying George Best. Indie rock band The Wedding Present named their first album &quot;George Best&quot;, and featured Best on the cover wearing his red Manchester United kit. After his death, Brian Kennedy and Peter Corry released a single entitled &quot;George Best – A Tribute&quot;. Best features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series; he was included as an icon in the &quot;FIFA 19&quot; Ultimate Team Legends.

In 2007, &quot;GQ&quot; magazine named him as one of the 50 most stylish men of the past 50 years. When Best played football, salaries were a fraction of what top players earn today, but, with his pop star image and celebrity status, Best still earned a fortune. He lost almost all of it. When asked what happened to the money he had earned, Best quipped: &quot;I spent a lot of money on booze, birds (women) and fast cars. The rest I just squandered.&quot;

In 2012, Best was featured in the list of &quot;The New Elizabethans&quot; to mark the diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. A panel of seven academics, journalists and historians named Best among the group of people in the UK &quot;whose actions during the reign of Elizabeth II have had a significant impact on lives in these islands and given the age its character&quot;.

=== Alcoholism ===

Best suffered from alcoholism for most of his adult life, leading to numerous controversies and, eventually, his death. In 1981, while playing in the United States, Best robbed a woman by taking money from her handbag in order to fund a drinking session. He recalled the incident, &quot;We were sitting in a bar on the beach, and when she got up to go to the toilet I leaned over and took all the money she had in her bag.&quot;

In 1984, Best received a three-month prison sentence for drunk driving, assaulting a police officer and failing to answer bail. He spent Christmas 1984 at Ford Open Prison. Contrary to popular belief and urban legend, he never played football for the prison team. In September 1990, Best appeared on the primetime BBC1 chat show &quot;Wogan&quot; in which he was heavily drunk and swore, at one point saying to the host, &quot;Terry, I like screwing&quot;. In 2002, he told &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;I was ill and everyone could see it but me.&quot;

=== Liver transplant and controversy ===
Best was diagnosed with severe liver damage in March 2000. His liver was said to be functioning at only 20%. In 2001, he was admitted to hospital with pneumonia. At the end of July and start of August 2002, he had a successful liver transplant at the private Cromwell Hospital in London. He haemorrhaged so badly during the operation that he nearly died. The transplant was performed at public expense on the NHS, a decision which was controversial due to Best&#x27;s alcoholism. The controversy was reignited in 2003 when he was spotted openly drinking white wine spritzers. On 2 February 2004, Best was convicted of another drink-driving offence and banned from driving for 20 months.

== Death ==

Best continued to drink and was sometimes seen at his local pub in Surbiton, London. On 3 October 2005, he was admitted to intensive care at the private Cromwell Hospital in London, suffering from a kidney infection caused by the side effects of immuno-suppressive drugs used to prevent his body from rejecting his transplanted liver. On 27 October, newspapers stated that Best was close to death and had sent a farewell message to his loved ones. Close friends in the game visited his bedside to make their farewells, including Rodney Marsh, and the two other members of the &quot;United Trinity&quot;, Bobby Charlton and Denis Law. 

On 20 November, the tabloid &quot;News of the World&quot; published a picture of Best, at his own request, showing him in his hospital bed with jaundice, along with a warning about the dangers of alcohol with his message: &quot;Don&#x27;t die like me&quot;. In the early hours of 25 November 2005, treatment was stopped; later that day he died, aged 59, as a result of a lung infection and multiple organ failure.

Tributes were paid to Best from around the world, including from arguably three of the greatest football players ever, Pelé, Diego Maradona and Johan Cruyff. Maradona commented: &quot;George inspired me when I was young. He was flamboyant and exciting and able to inspire his teammates. I actually think we were very similar players – dribblers who were able to create moments of magic.&quot; Fellow Manchester United legend Eric Cantona gave a eulogy to Best: &quot;I would love him to save me a place in his team, George Best that is, not God.&quot;

The Premier League announced that a minute&#x27;s silence would be observed before all Premier League games to be held over the weekend of his death; however, at many grounds a minute&#x27;s applause broke out in his honour. The first match at Old Trafford after Best&#x27;s death was a League Cup tie against West Bromwich Albion, the club against which he made his debut for Manchester United in 1963. The match, which United won, was preceded by tributes from former teammate Sir Bobby Charlton. Best&#x27;s son, Calum, former teammates and surviving members from the West Brom team which he played against in his debut all joined the current United squad on the pitch for a minute&#x27;s silence. During this, fans in every seat held aloft pictures of Best, which were given out before the match.

=== Funeral ===

His body left the family home at Cregagh Road, East Belfast, shortly after 10 am on Saturday 3 December 2005. The cortege then travelled the short distance to Stormont. The route was lined with around 100,000 mourners. Former Northern Ireland manager Billy Bingham, international teammates Derek Dougan, Peter McParland, Harry Gregg and Gerry Armstrong, and Denis Law were the first to carry the coffin to the base of the Stormont steps.

There was an 11 am service in the Grand Hall attended by 300 invited guests relayed to around 25,000 mourners inside the grounds of Stormont. Best&#x27;s brother Ian, agent Phil Hughes, Dr Akeel Alisa, who treated Best, and his brothers-in-law Norman McNarry and Alan McPherson, were also pallbearers. As the cortege left Stormont, the Gilnahirk pipe band played. The funeral was live on several television stations including BBC One. Afterwards, Best was interred beside his mother, Annie Mary Best, in a private ceremony at the hill-top Roselawn Cemetery, overlooking east Belfast.

=== Memorials ===

Belfast City Airport was renamed George Best Belfast City Airport as a tribute to Best. The official new name and signage was unveiled to a gathering of the Best family and friends at the airport on 22 May 2006, which would have been his 60th birthday. Public opinion in Northern Ireland about the renaming of the airport was divided, with one poll showing 52% in favour and 48% against. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) deputy leader and East Belfast Member of Parliament Peter Robinson, in whose constituency Belfast City airport is situated, stated that his preference was a sports stadium be named after Best.

In March 2006, the airline Flybe named a Dash 8 (Q400) plane &quot;The George Best&quot;. The aircraft was later used to carry Best&#x27;s family across to the Manchester memorial service for Best.

In June 2006, Sarah Fabergé, great-granddaughter of Russian imperial jeweller Peter Carl Fabergé, was commissioned to create the George Best Egg, in tribute. A limited edition of 68 eggs were produced, with all profits from the sale of the eggs going to the George Best Foundation, which promotes health through sport and supports people with alcohol and drug problems. The first egg is on display at the George Best Airport. For the first anniversary of his death, Ulster Bank issued 1 million commemorative £5 notes. The notes sold out in five days. The notes sold on the online auction site eBay for up to £30.

In December 2006, the George Best Memorial Trust launched a fund-raising drive to raise £200,000 in subscriptions to pay for a life-size bronze sculpture of George Best. By 2008 the money had still not been raised until a local developer, Doug Elliott, announced on 29 January 2008, that he would put up the rest of the money and would manage delivery of the project.
