<text>Frederick William Lanchester (23 October 1868 – 8 March 1946), was an English polymath and engineer who made important contributions to automotive engineering and to aerodynamics, and co-invented the topic of operations research.

Lanchester became a pioneer British motor-car builder, a hobby which resulted in him building the first British car in 1895 and developing a successful car company.

Some of the innovations Lanchester developed have gone on to become widely adopted in the car industry. 

== Biography ==
Lanchester was born in St John&#x27;s Wood, London to Henry Jones Lanchester (1834–1914), an architect, and his wife Octavia (1834–1916), a tutor of Latin and mathematics. He was the fourth of eight children; his older brother Henry Vaughan Lanchester also became an architect; his younger sister Edith Lanchester was a socialist and suffragette; and his brothers George Herbert Lanchester and Frank joined him in forming the Lanchester Motor Company.

When he was a year old, his father relocated the family to Brighton, and young Frederick attended a preparatory school and a nearby boarding school, where he did not distinguish himself. He himself, thinking back, remarked that, &quot;it seemed that Nature was conserving his energy&quot;. However, he did succeed in winning a scholarship to the Hartley Institution, in Southampton, and after three years won another scholarship, to Kensington College, which is now part of Imperial College. He supplemented his instruction in applied engineering by attending evening classes at Finsbury Technical School. Unfortunately, he ended his education without having obtained a formal qualification.

When he completed his education in 1888, he acquired a job as a Patent Office draughtsman for £3 a week. About this time he registered a patent for an isometrograph, a draughtsman&#x27;s instrument for hatching, shading and other geometrical design work.

In 1919, at the age of fifty-one, Lanchester married Dorothea Cooper, the daughter of Thomas Cooper, the vicar of St Peter&#x27;s Church in Field Broughton in Lancashire. The couple relocated to 41 Bedford Square, London, but in 1924 Lanchester built a house to his own design (Dyott End) in Oxford Road, Moseley, Birmingham. The couple remained there for the rest of their life together but did not have any children.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1922, and in 1926 the Royal Aeronautical Society awarded him a fellowship and a gold medal.

In 1925 Lanchester founded a company named Lanchester Laboratories Ltd., to perform industrial research and development work. Although he developed an improved radio and gramophone speaker, he was unable to market it successfully because of the Great Depression. He continued, overworking, until in 1934 his health failed and the company was forced to close. He was diagnosed eventually with Parkinson&#x27;s disease and was reportedly much grieved that this, along with cataracts in both eyes, prevented him from &quot;doing any official job&quot; during the Second World War.

He was awarded gold medals by the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1941 and the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1945.

Although he achieved his fame by his creative brilliance as an engineer, Frederick Lanchester was a man of diverse interests, blessed with a fine singing voice. Using the pseudonym of Paul Netherton-Herries he published two volumes of poetry.

Lanchester, who had never been successful commercially, lived the remainder of his life in straitened circumstances, and it was only through charitable help that he was able to remain in his home. He died at his home, Dyott End, on 8 March 1946.

== Work ==

=== Gas engines ===
Near the end of 1888, Lanchester went to work for the Forward Gas Engine Company of Saltley, Birmingham as assistant works manager. His contract of employment included a clause stating that any technical improvements that he made would be the intellectual property of the company. Lanchester wisely struck this out before signing. This action was prescient, for in 1889 he invented and patented a Pendulum Governor to control engine speeds, for which he received a royalty of ten shillings for each one fitted to a Forward Engine. In 1890 he patented a Pendulum Accelerometer, for recording the acceleration and braking of road and rail vehicles.

After the death of the current works manager, Lanchester was promoted to his job. He then designed a new gas engine of greater size and power than any produced by the company before. The engine was a vertical one with horizontal, opposed poppet valves for inlet and exhaust. The engine had a very low compression ratio, but was very economical to operate.

In 1890 Lanchester patented a self-starting device for gas engines. He subsequently sold the rights for his invention to the Crossley Gas Engine Company for a handsome sum.

He rented a small workshop next to the Forward Company&#x27;s works and used this for experimental work of his own. In this workshop, he produced a small vertical single cylinder gas engine of , running at 600 rpm. This was coupled directly to a dynamo, which Lanchester used to light the company&#x27;s office and part of the factory.

=== Petrol engines ===
Lanchester began to find the conflict between his job as works manager and his research work irksome. Therefore, in 1893, he resigned his job in favour of his younger brother George. At about the same time, he produced a second engine type similar in design to his previous one but operating on benzene at 800 rpm. An important part of his new engine was the revolutionary carburettor, for mixing the fuel and air correctly. His invention was known as a wick carburettor, because fuel was drawn into a series of wicks, from where it was vapourised. He patented this invention in 1905.

Lanchester installed his new petrol engine in a flat-bottomed launch, which the engine drove via a stern paddle wheel. Lanchester built the launch in the garden of his home in Olton, Warwickshire. The boat was launched at Salter&#x27;s slipway in Oxford in 1904, and was the first motorboat built in Britain.

=== Cars ===
Having put a petrol engine in a boat, the next logical step was to use it for road transport. Lanchester set about designing a four-wheeled vehicle to be driven by a petrol engine. He designed a new petrol engine of , with two crankshafts rotating in opposite directions, for exemplary smoothness, and air cooling by way of vanes mounted on the flywheel. There was a revolutionary epicyclic gearbox (years before Henry Ford adopted it) giving two forward speeds plus reverse, and which drove the rear wheels &quot;via&quot; chains. With a walnut body, it seated three, side by side. (By contrast, Rudolf Egg&#x27;s tricycle had a 3 hp (2.2 kW) 402 cc {24½in3) de Dion-Bouton single and was capable of 40 km/h {25 mph}, and Léon Bollée&#x27;s trike a 1.9 kW {2.5 hp} 650 cc (40 in3) engine of his own design, capable of over 50 km/h {30 mph}.

Lanchester&#x27;s car was completed in 1895 and given its first test run in 1896, and proved to be unsatisfactory, being underpowered and having transmission problems. Lanchester designed a new 8 hp (6 kW) 2,895 cc (177 in3) air-cooled engine with two horizontally opposed cylinders, still with two crankshafts. He also re-designed the epicyclic gearbox and combined it with the engine. A driveshaft connected the gearbox to a live axle. The new engine and transmission were fitted to the original 1895 car.

Lanchester had relocated his business to larger workshops in Ladywood Road, Fiveways, Birmingham as work on the car progressed and had also sold his house to help finance the cost of his research. A second car was then built with the same engine and transmission but with Lanchester&#x27;s own design of cantilever suspension. This was completed in 1898 and won a gold medal for its design and performance at the Automobile Exhibition and Trials at Richmond. It became known as the Gold Medal Phaeton.

In 1898, Lanchester designed a water-cooled version of his engine, which was fitted to a boat, driving a propeller. In 1900 the Gold Medal Phaeton was entered for the first Royal Automobile Club 1,000 Miles Trial and completed the course successfully after one mechanical failure en route.

=== Lanchester Engine Company ===
In December 1899 Lanchester and his brothers created the Lanchester Engine Company in order to manufacture cars that could be sold to the public. A factory was acquired in Montgomery Street, Sparkbrook, Birmingham, known as the Armourer Works. In his new factory, Lanchester designed a new ten horsepower twin cylinder engine. He decided to use a worm drive transmission and designed a machine to cut the worm gears. He patented this machine in 1905 and it continued for 25 years to produce all of the Lanchester worm gears. He also introduced the use of splined shafts and couplings in place of keys and keyways, another innovation that he patented. The back axle had roller bearings and Lanchester designed the machines to make these. His car was designed with the engine placed between the two front seats rather than at the front, and also had a side-mounted tiller rather than a steering wheel. The transmission also included a system similar to modern disc brakes that clamped the clutch disc for braking, rather than using a separate system as in most cars. On 1 December 1902, Lanchester was awarded Patent No. 26,407 for the disc brake.

The new 10 hp car appeared in 1901 and remained in production until 1905, with only minor design modifications. He became a friend of Rudyard Kipling and would send him experimental models to test. In 1905, Lanchester produced a 20 hp four-cylinder engine, and in 1906 he produced a 28 hp six-cylinder engine. Although Sir Henry Royce had already tackled the problem of crankshaft torsional oscillation and consequent vibration in straight-6 engines, Lanchester analysed the problem scientifically and invented the torsional crankshaft vibration damper as a solution to the problem of engine balance. His design, patented in 1907, used a secondary flywheel coupled to the end of the crankshaft with a viscous clutch. At around the same time Lanchester also patented a harmonic balancer to cancel out the unbalanced secondary forces in a four-cylinder engine, using two balance weights rotating at twice crankshaft speed in opposite directions.

The Lanchester Engine Company sold about 350 cars of various designs between 1900 and 1904, when they became bankrupt due to the incompetence of the board of directors. It was immediately reformed as The Lanchester Motor Company. During this period he also experimented with fuel injection, turbochargers, added steering wheels in 1907 and invented the accelerator pedal to help control engine operation, which previously would not cease if the operator had problems. He invented (or was the first to use) detachable wire wheels, bearings that were pressure-fed with oil, stamped steel pistons, piston rings, hollow connecting rods, the torsional vibration damper for 6-cylinder engines, and the harmonic balancer for 4-cylinder designs.

Eventually Lanchester became disillusioned with the activities of the company&#x27;s directors, and in 1910 resigned as general manager, becoming their part-time consultant and technical adviser. His brothers, George and Frank, assumed technical and administrative responsibility for the company.

===Daimler Company===
In 1909 Lanchester became a technical consultant for the Daimler Company where he became involved in a number of engineering projects including the Daimler-Knight engine, variants of which powered the petrol-electric KPL bus and the Daimler-Renard Road Train, and the first British heavy tanks of World War I and powered all Daimler cars from 1909 to the mid-1930s winning in 1909 the coveted RAC Dewar Trophy.

==== Daimler-Knight engines ====
Working with Daimler in Coventry, the American inventor Charles Knight had obtained a British patent for his modified Knight engine on 6 June 1908, and in September 1908 Daimler announced the first 4-cylinder Daimler-Knight engine a double sleeve-valve design developed from Knight&#x27;s 1904 patents. Daimler had put all its resources into this &quot;rather unsatisfactory engine&quot; (according to Harry Ricardo), but although Lanchester continued to develop and work on the design, &quot;he had realised that it was a forlorn hope from the start.&quot;

==== KPL bus ====
The hybrid petrol-electric KPL (Knight-Pieper-Lanchester) bus used a pair of 4-cylinder, 12 h.p. (R.A.C. rating) Daimler-Knight engines each coupled to a dynamotor driving one of the rear wheels, using a patent of Henri Pieper. The bus was announced in June 1910 but the Tilling-Stevens company (an associate of the London General Omnibus Company) threatened a patent infringement action, and it was withdrawn in May 1911 after only 10 buses had been made.

==== Daimler-Renard Road Train ====
Daimler began importing the Renard Road Train in February 1907. Daimler fitted a number of four-cylinder &#x27;pre-Knight&#x27; engines in the Road Train; Lanchester&#x27;s development work resulted in a 75/80 hp Daimler-Knight 6-cylinder engine for the Daimler-Renard tractor unit in 1910. 
The Birmingham Small Arms company (BSA) bought Daimler in 1910, and Lanchester became consultant engineer to the new parent company.

==== Daimler-Foster tractors ====
A larger 100 hp 6-cylinder engine with twin crankshafts each driving a sleeve-valve appeared in January 1912, fitted to the larger of two Daimler-Foster agricultural tractors (&#x27;Agritractors&#x27;) made in conjunction with William Foster &amp; Co. of Lincoln. According to Harry Ricardo, the duplication of the whole of the valve operating mechanism involved excessive mechanical complication and introduced grave difficulties in the way of mechanical synchronization. Lanchester designed a new cylinder head for sleeve-valve engines and patented it with Daimler in February 1913. Gaining an extra 5 hp by April 1913, the 105 hp Daimler-Knight engine (coupled with the tractor&#x27;s massive transmission designed by William Tritton) powered the Daimler-Foster artillery tractor, the No. 1 Lincoln Machine, Little Willie, and the British Mark I-IV tanks during World War I.

Lanchester&#x27;s contract with Daimler was terminated after the Wall Street crash of 1929; the Lanchester Motor Company&#x27;s overdraft was also withdrawn, forcing immediate liquidation of its assets. BSA group, the owners of Daimler since 1910, completed the purchase of the Lanchester company in January 1931 and moved production to Radford, Coventry.

=== Aeronautics ===
Lanchester began to study aeronautics seriously in 1892, eleven years before the first successful powered flight. Whilst crossing the Atlantic on a voyage to the United States, Lanchester studied the flight of herring gulls, seeing how they were able to use motionless wings to catch up-currents of air. He measured various birds to see how the centre of gravity compared with the centre of support. As a result of his deliberations, Lanchester, eventually formulated his circulation theory of flight. This is the basis of aerodynamics and the foundation of modern aerofoil theory. In 1894 he tested his theory on a number of models. In 1897 he presented a paper entitled &quot;The soaring of birds and the possibilities of mechanical flight&quot; to the Physical Society, but it was rejected, being too advanced for its time. Lanchester realised that powered flight required an engine with a much greater power-to-weight ratio than any existing engine. He proposed to design and build such an engine, but was advised that no one would take him seriously.

Lanchester was discouraged by the attitude to his aeronautical theory, and concentrated on automobile development for the next ten years. In 1906 he published the first part of a two-volume work, &quot;Aerial Flight&quot;, dealing with the problems of powered flight . In it, he developed a model for the vortices that occur behind wings during flight, which included the first full description of lift and drag. His book was not well received in England, but created interest in Germany where the scientist Ludwig Prandtl mathematically confirmed the correctness of Lanchester&#x27;s vortex theory. In his second volume, Lanchester turned his attention to aircraft stability, &quot;Aerodonetics&quot; , developing his phugoid theory which contained a description of oscillations and stalls. During this work he outlined the basic layout used in most aircraft since then. Lanchester&#x27;s contribution to aeronautical science was not recognised until the end of his life.

In 1909 H. H. Asquith&#x27;s Advisory Committee for Aeronautics was established, and Lanchester was appointed a member. Lanchester predicted correctly that aircraft would play an increasingly important part in warfare, unlike the military command which envisioned warfare as continuing much the same way it had in the past.

The same year, 1909, Lanchester patented contra-rotating propellers.

In 1914 he gave the Institution of Civil Engineers&#x27; &#x27;James Forrest Lecture&#x27;, on the subject of &quot;The Flying Machine From An Engineering Standpoint&quot;.

=== Lanchester&#x27;s Power Laws ===
Lanchester was particularly interested in predicting the outcome of aerial battles. In 1914, before the start of World War I, he published his ideas on aerial warfare in a series of articles in &quot;Engineering&quot;. They were published in book form in 1916 as &quot;Aircraft in Warfare: The Dawn of the Fourth Arm&quot;, and included a description of a series of differential equations that are known now as Lanchester&#x27;s Power Laws. These laws described how two forces would attrit each other in combat, and demonstrated that the ability of modern weapons to operate at long ranges dramatically changed the nature of combat—a force that was twice as large had been twice as powerful in the past, but now it was four times, the square of the quotient.

Lanchester&#x27;s Laws were originally applied practically in the United States to study logistics, where they developed into operations research (OR) (operational research in UK usage). OR techniques are now widely used, perhaps most so for business.

=== The post-war company ===
After the war, the company introduced the more conventional Forty engine, a rival for the Rolls-Royce 40/50 hp; it was joined in 1924 by an overhead cam 21 hp (RAC Rating) six cylinder engine. In 1921 Lanchester was the first company to export left-hand drive cars. Tinted glass was also introduced on these cars for the first time. A 4440 cc straight eight engine was introduced at the 1928 Southport Rally, again with overhead cams: it proved to be the last &quot;real&quot; Lanchester, in 1931 the company was acquired by B.S.A., who had also owned the Daimler Company since 1909. From then until 1956, Lanchester cars were built at the Daimler factory in Coventry as sister cars with Daimler, like R-R with Bentley [ref Lanchester Legacy trilogy].

== Legacy ==
Lanchester was respected by most fellow engineers as a genius, but he did not have the business acumen to convert his inventiveness to financial gain. Whereas James Watt had found an able business partner in Matthew Boulton, who managed business affairs, Lanchester had no such assistance. During most of his career he lacked financial backing to be able to develop his ideas and perform research, as he would have liked. He nonetheless made many contributions in many different fields. He wrote more than sixty technical papers for various institutions and organisations, and received awards from a number of bodies.

=== Archives ===

Lanchester&#x27;s papers, notebooks, and related material are dispersed between a number of archive collections, including those of Coventry University, the University of Southampton Library, Birmingham Museums Trust, the National Aerospace Library, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Cambridge University&#x27;s Churchill Archives Centre and the Bodleian Library at Oxford University.

==Memorials==

In 1970, several colleges in Coventry merged to form Lanchester Polytechnic, so named in memory of Frederick Lanchester. It was renamed Coventry Polytechnic in 1987, and became Coventry University in 1992.

Coventry University&#x27;s Lanchester Library opened in 2000. Its name commemorates Frederick Lanchester and the previous incarnation of the university as Lanchester Polytechnic. Like much of Lanchester&#x27;s own work, apparently regardless of convention, its form displays the way it functions.

Its distinctive appearance comes from the building&#x27;s energy efficient specifications, making use of light wells and exhaust stacks to draw air through the building, providing natural ventilation.

An open-air sculpture, the Lanchester Car Monument, in the Bloomsbury, Heartlands, area of Birmingham, designed by Tim Tolkien, is on the site where the Lanchester company built their first four-wheel, petrol car in 1895. It was unveiled by Frank Lanchester&#x27;s daughter, Mrs Marjorie Bingeman, and the Lanchester historian, Chris Clark at the Centenary Rally in 1995.

<doc id="420524" wikidata="Q4949085" url="?curid=420524" title="Bottleneck traveling salesman problem">
<text>The Bottleneck traveling salesman problem (bottleneck TSP) is a problem in discrete or combinatorial optimization. The problem is to find the Hamiltonian cycle (visiting each node exactly once) in a weighted graph which minimizes the weight of the highest-weight edge of the cycle. It was first formulated by with some additional constraints, and in its full generality by .

==Complexity==
The problem is known to be NP-hard. The decision problem version of this, &quot;for a given length is there a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph with no edge longer than ?&quot;, is NP-complete. NP-completeness follows immediately by a reduction from the problem of finding a Hamiltonian cycle.

==Algorithms==
Another reduction, from the bottleneck TSP to the usual TSP (where the goal is to minimize the sum of edge lengths), allows any algorithm for the usual TSP to also be used to solve the bottleneck TSP.
If the edge weights of the bottleneck TSP are replaced by any other numbers that have the same relative order, then the bottleneck solution remains unchanged.
If, in addition, each number in the sequence exceeds the sum of all smaller numbers, then the bottleneck solution will also equal the usual TSP solution.
For instance, such a result may be attained by resetting each weight to where is the number of vertices in the graph and is the rank of the original weight of the edge in the sorted sequence of weights. For instance, following this transformation, the Held–Karp algorithm could be used to solve the bottleneck TSP in time .

Alternatively, the problem can be solved by performing a binary search or sequential search for the smallest such that the subgraph of edges of weight at most has a Hamiltonian cycle. This method leads to solutions whose running time is only a logarithmic factor larger than the time to find a Hamiltonian cycle.

==Variations==

In an asymmetric bottleneck TSP, there are cases where the weight from node &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; is different from the weight from B to A (e. g. travel time between two cities with a traffic jam in one direction).

The Euclidean bottleneck TSP, or planar bottleneck TSP, is the bottleneck TSP with the distance being the ordinary Euclidean distance. The problem still remains NP-hard. However, many heuristics work better for it than for other distance functions.

The maximum scatter traveling salesman problem is another variation of the traveling salesman problem in which the goal is to find a Hamiltonian cycle that maximizes the minimum edge length rather than minimizing the maximum length. Its applications include the analysis of medical images, and the scheduling of metalworking steps in aircraft manufacture to avoid heat buildup from steps that are nearby in both time and space. It can be translated into an instance of the bottleneck TSP problem by negating all edge lengths (or, to keep the results positive, subtracting them all from a large enough constant). However, although this transformation preserves the optimal solution, it does not preserve the quality of approximations to that solution.

==Metric approximation algorithm==
If the graph is a metric space then there is an efficient approximation algorithm that finds a Hamiltonian cycle with maximum edge weight being no more than twice the optimum.
This result follows by Fleischner&#x27;s theorem, that the square of a 2-vertex-connected graph always contains a Hamiltonian cycle. It is easy to find a threshold value , the smallest value such that the edges of weight form a 2-connected graph. Then provides a valid lower bound on the bottleneck TSP weight, for the bottleneck TSP is itself a 2-connected graph and necessarily contains an edge of weight at least . However, the square of the subgraph of edges of weight at most is Hamiltonian. By the triangle inequality for metric spaces, its Hamiltonian cycle has edges of weight at most .

This approximation ratio is best possible. For, any unweighted graph can be transformed into a metric space by setting its edge weights to and setting the distance between all nonadjacent pairs of vertices to . An approximation with ratio better than in this metric space could be used to determine whether the original graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle, an NP-complete problem.

Without the assumption that the input is a metric space, no finite approximation ratio is possible.

<text>Javier Sánchez Vicario (; born 1 February 1968) is a former top-ten doubles professional tennis player from Spain. Sánchez won the US Open junior singles and doubles title in 1986, and reached the quarterfinal stage in the US Open men&#x27;s singles event twice – in 1991 and 1996.

==Career==

Sánchez won the US Open junior singles and doubles title in 1986, partnering with Tomás Carbonell, and became world no. 1 junior that same year.

In Javier&#x27;s first career singles final in 1987 in Madrid, he faced his brother Emilio Sánchez. Emilio won the match in three sets. Emilio and Javier would play each other a total of 12 times during their careers, Emilio winning ten of their encounters and Javier winning two. They also partnered together to win three doubles titles.

Sanchez won his first professional doubles titles in 1987 and his first singles title in 1988 in Buenos Aires. His best grand slam performances included reaching the quarterfinals of the US Open in 1991 (defeating world no. 5 Sergi Bruguera) and 1996. Sanchez also reached the semifinals of the 1994 Hamburg Masters. He won a career total of four singles titles and 26 doubles titles, and reached a career-high ranking of no. 23 in singles (in 1994) and no. 9 in doubles (in 1992).

==Personal life==
Sánchez is a member of one of the world&#x27;s most successful tennis families. His younger sister Arantxa Sánchez Vicario achieved the world no. 1 ranking in both singles and doubles, and won four Grand Slam singles titles; and his older brother Emilio Sánchez reached world no. 1 in doubles and won five Grand Slam doubles titles. They also have an older sister – Marisa – who also played professional tennis, peaking at world no. 368 in 1990.

Sánchez and wife Isabel wed in September 1994. They have two daughters, Alba (born July 1998) and Julia (born March 2000).

In 2012, Arantxa Sánchez Vicario sued Javier Sánchez (and their father) for the alleged mishandling and embezzlement of her $60 million career earnings. The court case continued over three years, and in 2015 concluded in a private settlement.

<doc id="420528" wikidata="Q1264599" url="?curid=420528" title="Duke of Richmond">
<text>Duke of Richmond is a title in the Peerage of England that has been created four times in British history. It has been held by members of the royal Tudor and Stuart families.

The current dukedom of Richmond was created in 1675 for Charles Lennox, the illegitimate son of Charles II of England and one of his mistresses, the Breton noblewoman Louise de Penancoët de Kérouaille; Charles Lennox was also made Duke of Lennox a month later. Charles Gordon-Lennox, 6th Duke of Richmond was furthermore created Duke of Gordon in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1876, meaning that the Duke holds three dukedoms—plus, in pretence, the French Duchy of Aubigny-sur-Nère.

==History of the dukedom==
Prior to the creation of the dukedom the early nobles of England associated with Richmondshire were Lords and Earls of Richmond. At times the honour of Richmond was held without a title. The dukedom of Richmond emerged under Henry VIII.

The first creation of a dukedom of Richmond (as &quot;Duke of Richmond and Somerset&quot;) was made in 1525 for Henry FitzRoy, an illegitimate son of Henry VIII. His mother was Elizabeth Blount. Upon the Duke&#x27;s death without children in 1536, his titles became extinct.

The second creation was in 1623 for Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox (see Lennox (district)) (1574–1624), who also held other titles in the peerage of Scotland. He was created Earl of Richmond and Baron Settrington in 1613 and Duke of Richmond in the peerage of England in 1623 as a member of the Lennox line (not unlike King James VI &amp; I himself) in the House of Stuart. These became extinct at his death in 1624, but his Scottish honours devolved on his brother Esmé, Earl of March, who thus became 3rd Duke of Lennox in the peerage of Scotland. Esmé&#x27;s son James, 4th Duke of Lennox (1612–1655) subsequently received the third creation of the dukedom of Richmond in 1641, when the two dukedoms again became united. In 1672, on the death of James&#x27; nephew Charles, 3rd Duke of Richmond and 6th Duke of Lennox, both titles again became extinct.

The fourth creation of the dukedom of Richmond was in August 1675, when Charles II granted the title to Charles Lennox, his illegitimate son by Louise de Keroualle, Duchess of Portsmouth. Charles Lennox was further created Duke of Lennox a month later. Charles&#x27; son, also Charles, succeeded to the French title Duke of Aubigny (of Aubigny-sur-Nère) on the death of his grandmother in 1734. The 6th Duke of Richmond and Lennox was created Duke of Gordon (See Clan Gordon) in 1876. Thus, the Duke holds three (four, if the French Aubigny claim is accepted) dukedoms; three, equal since 2022 to Prince William, Duke of Cornwall, of Rothesay and of Cambridge.

The subsidiary titles of the dukedom created in 1675 are &quot;Earl of March&quot; (created 1675), &quot;Earl of Darnley&quot; (1675), &quot;Earl of Kinrara&quot; (1876), &quot;Baron Settrington&quot;, of Settrington in the County of York (1675), and &quot;Lord Torbolton&quot; (1675).


The Dukes of Richmond, Lennox and Gordon are normally styled &quot;Duke of Richmond and Gordon&quot;. Before the creation of the Dukedom of Gordon they were styled &quot;Duke of Richmond and Lennox&quot;. The titles &quot;Earl of March&quot; and &quot;Baron Settrington&quot; were created in the peerage of England along with the Dukedom of Richmond. The titles &quot;Earl of Darnley&quot; and &quot;Lord Torbolton&quot; were created in the peerage of Scotland along with the dukedom of Lennox. Finally, the title &quot;Earl of Kinrara&quot; was created in the peerage of the United Kingdom with the dukedom of Gordon. The eldest son of the Duke uses the courtesy title &quot;Earl of March and Kinrara&quot;. Before the creation of the Dukedom of Gordon, the courtesy title used was &quot;Earl of March&quot;.

The family seat is Goodwood House near Chichester, West Sussex.

<text>Sex and Lucia () is a 2001 Spanish drama film written and directed by Julio Medem, and starring Paz Vega and Tristán Ulloa, alongside Najwa Nimri, Daniel Freire, Javier Cámara, Silvia Llanos and Elena Anaya.

==Plot==
Lucía, a waitress, is talking on the phone with her depressed writer boyfriend Lorenzo after they had a bitter argument and she walked out. Since he has been in a &#x27;funk&#x27; for a while, she is worried and goes home to console him. Finding an empty apartment, Lucía is frantic. She receives a phone call from the police while finding a suicide note and is so afraid of bad news that she hangs up, assuming the worst. They call back, but she ignores the ringing phone, packs a bag, and flees. Looking for a new beginning, Lucía travels to the mysterious Balearic Islands that Lorenzo had always talked of, but had recently been very negative about.

Six years earlier, Lorenzo is having casual sex in the ocean on a bright moon-lit night with a beautiful married woman he had just met named Elena. They part ways, expecting never to see each other again. She discovers she is pregnant with his child, and tries to find him, but is unable to since she knows little about him.

Later, as Lorenzo talks with his literary agent at a restaurant, discussing his writer&#x27;s block, Lucía catches his attention as he gets up from his table to get cigarettes. She asks to speak to him and he joins her. She brazenly tells him that ever since she read his latest book, she has been following him and has fallen passionately in love with him. A smitten Lorenzo immediately engages the sexy, passionate Lucía and she moves into Lorenzo&#x27;s apartment.

The film then interweaves the past and present, both of the characters in the film, and of the characters in Lorenzo&#x27;s novel.

Lorenzo repeatedly stalls for time on his new book with his editor, while his relationship with Lucía deepens. About six years pass. Lorenzo learns he has a daughter as a result of his encounter with Elena and begins to visit the child outside of her school, meeting her babysitter Belén.

Belén tells Lorenzo her mother is a recently retired porn actress with a new hot boyfriend, and virtually seduces Lorenzo with chatter of sexual context and banter about her fantasies. Lorenzo uses these encounters and his fantasies about Belén and her mother as content for his book, and Lucía reads about it, thinking it fiction. Meanwhile, he does not disclose his fatherhood to Lucía or the child, nor even attempt to contact Elena.

Belén flirts with Lorenzo and eventually invites him over to Elena&#x27;s house while she babysits his daughter, Luna. Lorenzo tells Luna a bedtime story, and after she falls asleep, he and Belén begin to have sex. They are interrupted as Luna knocks at the bedroom door, and they watch in horror as the family dog, a large Rotweiler in &#x27;protect mode&#x27;, kills Luna. Belén is stunned. Lorenzo runs away and falls into a deep depression.

Lorenzo&#x27;s writing turns dark, towards depraved sex and death. He anonymously contacts Elena, who has moved to the island to find solace and recall better days and provides her a nice story about a beautiful child that loves to swim in the sea, to cheer her spirits. But his now guilt-ridden and uncommunicative relationship with Lucía begins to collapse.

Back in the present, Lucía meets a scuba diver on the island, Carlos, and through him, Elena, who runs an inn on the island. Lucía rents a room, and the women bond as friends, not knowing their intimate connection. But when Lucía mentions Lorenzo by name, and his past visit to the island long ago, Elena deduces the connection. Lucía sees a picture of Luna (looking remarkably like her father and remembering the name from Lorenzo&#x27;s novel) and she makes the connection too.

Lorenzo&#x27;s editor visits Lorenzo in the hospital, where he was taken after being in an &#x27;accident&#x27;, spending several weeks in recovery. When Lorenzo asks about Lucía, the editor tells Lorenzo that Lucía probably thinks he is dead.

Lorenzo guesses Lucía is on the island and has the editor take him there. After both women discover that Lorenzo isn&#x27;t dead, the three characters cope with and finally understand the entanglements of their interwoven relationships.

<doc id="420534" wikidata="Q1473699" url="?curid=420534" title="Full-motion video">
<text>Full-motion video (FMV) is a video game narration technique that relies upon pre-recorded video files (rather than sprites, vectors, or 3D models) to display action in the game. While many games feature FMVs as a way to present information during cutscenes, games that are primarily presented through FMVs are referred to as full-motion video games or interactive movies.

The early 1980s saw almost exclusive use of the LaserDisc for FMV games. Many arcade games used the technology but it was ultimately considered to be a fad and fell out of use. In the early 1990s FMV games had a resurgence of interest, the proliferation of optical discs gave rise to a slew of original FMV-based computer games such as &quot;Night Trap&quot; (1992), &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; (1993), &quot;Voyeur&quot; (1993), &quot;Phantasmagoria &quot; (1995), and &quot;Daryl F. Gates&#x27; Police Quest: SWAT&quot; (1995). The introduction of CD-based consoles like 3DO, CD-i, and Sega CD brought the concept of interactive FMV gameplay. Companies such as Digital Pictures and American Laser Games were formed to produce full-motion video games.

As the video game industry was emerging from its niche status into the mainstream—by 1994 it was two-and-a-half times larger than Hollywood by revenue—Hollywood began to make inroads into the growing market. In 1994, Sony&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; became the first video game title produced by a film studio. Soon thereafter, video game heavyweight Electronic Arts featured well-known Hollywood talent such as Mark Hamill, Tom Wilson and John Spencer in their critically acclaimed titles &quot;Wing Commander III&quot; and &quot;IV&quot;, setting the stage for a more expansive tie-up between the movie and video game industries. With the continual improvement of in-game CGI, FMV as a major gameplay component had eventually disappeared because of the limited gameplay options it allowed.

== Arcades ==
The first wave of FMV games originated in arcades in 1983 with laserdisc video games, notably &quot;Astron Belt&quot; from Sega and &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; from Cinematronics. They used Laserdiscs to store the video used in the game, which allowed for very high quality visuals compared to contemporary arcade games of the era. A number of arcade games using FMV with Laserdiscs were released over the next three years and the technology was touted as the future of video games. Some games released in this era reused video footage from other sources while others had it purpose made. &quot;Bega&#x27;s Battle&quot;, &quot;Cliff Hanger&quot; and &quot;Firefox&quot; reused footage, while titles like &quot;Space Ace&quot;, &quot;Time Gal&quot;, &quot;Thayer&#x27;s Quest&quot;, &quot;Super Don Quix-ote&quot; and &quot;Cobra Command&quot; were entirely original.

The use of pre-rendered 3D computer graphics for video sequences also date back to two arcade laserdisc games introduced in 1983: &quot;Interstellar&quot;, introduced by Funai at the AM Show in September, and &quot;Star Rider&quot;, introduced by Williams Electronics at the AMOA show in October.

The limited nature of FMV, high price to play (50 cents in an era where 25 cents was standard), high cost of the hardware and problems with reliability quickly took its toll on the buzz surrounding these games and their popularity diminished. By 1985, the allure of FMV and the Laserdisc had worn off, and the technology had disappeared from arcades by the end of 1987. RDI Video Systems (&quot;Thayer&#x27;s Quest&quot;) had branched out into making a home console called the Halcyon, but it failed and they went bankrupt. Cinematronics&#x27;s fortunes fared little better and they were bought out by Tradewest in 1987. Companies such as Atari canceled more prototype Laserdisc games than they released. Others, like Universal, stopped development on games after only one release despite announcing several titles.

After only a few years, the technology had improved and Laserdisc players were more reliable. In addition, costs had come down and the average price to play a game had gone up. These factors caused a resurgence of the popularity of Laserdiscs games in the arcade. American Laser Games released a light gun shooting game called &quot;Mad Dog McCree&quot; in 1990 and it was an instant hit and then in 1991 with &quot;Who Shot Johnny Rock?&quot; American Laser alone would go on to lease almost a dozen Laserdisc games over the next few years and many other companies again rushed to release titles using the technology. &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair II&quot;, a title which had been shelved years earlier, was released by Leland to strong sales. &quot;Time Traveler&quot; further pushed the technology by using special projection technology to give the appearance of 3D visuals.

Again, the fad passed quickly. The limited nature of the Laserdisc hampered interactivity and limited replayability, a key weakness in arcade games. American Laser, the chief producer of Laserdisc games during this era, had stopped making arcade games in 1994 and most other companies switched over to newer technologies around the same time. With the rise of 3D graphics and the introduction of hard drives and CD-ROMs to arcades, the large, expensive and small-capacity Laserdisc could not compete and disappeared. While CDs would see some use in the mid and late 1990s, it was hard drives, GD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs that caused the largest jump in FMV use in the arcade. Their very large capacities and mature, reliable technology allowed for much cheaper hardware than traditional hardware systems, and FMV cut-scenes became commonplace. FMV as a major gameplay component had disappeared by this time because of the limited gameplay options it allowed.

== Home systems ==

In 1984, a home console system called the Halcyon was released by RDI Video Systems that used Laserdiscs for its games and was to feature ports of several popular Laserdisc arcade games of the day. It used FMV exclusively, but the company folded after releasing only two titles for the system. The LaserActive from Pioneer would try the technology again in 1994, but it too failed.

By the early 1990s when PCs and consoles moved to creating games on a CD, they became technically capable of utilizing more than a few minutes&#x27; worth of movies in a game. This gave rise to a slew of original FMV-based computer games such as &quot;Night Trap&quot; (1992), &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; (1993), &quot;Voyeur&quot; (1993), &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot; (1995), and &quot;Daryl F. Gates&#x27; Police Quest: SWAT&quot; (1995). Other titles were simply scaled down ports of Laserdisc arcade games, some of them a decade old by this time. Regardless of their sources, these FMV games frequently used B-movie and TV actors and promised to create the experience of playing an interactive movie or animation. However, production values were quite low with amateurish sets, lighting, costumes, and special effects. Animated titles either cobbled together footage from old anime or used cheaper overseas animation producers to create their footage. In addition, the video quality in these early games was low, and the gameplay frequently did not live up to the hype becoming well-known failures in video gaming. At this time, consoles like 3DO, CD-i, and Sega CD borrowed this concept for several low-quality interactive games. Companies such as Digital Pictures and American Laser Games were formed to produce full-motion video games.

Also, the &quot;multimedia&quot; phenomenon that was exploding in popularity at the time increased the popularity of FMV because consumers were excited by this new emerging interactive technology. The personal computer was rapidly evolving during the early-to-mid 1990s from a simple text-based productivity device into a home entertainment machine. Gaming itself was also emerging from its niche market into the mainstream with the release of easier-to-use and more powerful operating systems, such as Microsoft&#x27;s Windows 95, that leveraged continually evolving processing capabilities. Some games like the &quot;Tex Murphy&quot; series combined FMV cutscenes with a virtual world to explore.

Video game consoles too saw incredible gains in presentation quality and contributed to the mass market&#x27;s growth in awareness of gaming. It was during the 1990s that the video/computer game industry first beat Hollywood in earnings. Sony made its debut in the console market with the release of the 32-bit PlayStation. The PlayStation was probably the first console to popularize FMVs (as opposed to earlier usage of FMV which was seen as a passing fad). A part of the machine&#x27;s hardware was a dedicated M-JPEG processing unit which enabled far superior quality relative to other platforms of the time. The FMVs in &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;, for example, were marketed as movie-quality at the time.

FMVs in games today typically consist of high-quality pre-rendered video sequences (CGI). These sequences are created in similar ways as computer generated effects in movies. Use of FMV as a selling point or focus has diminished in modern times. This is primarily due to graphical advancements in modern video game systems making it possible for in-game cinematics to have just as impressive visual quality. Digitized video footage of real actors in games generally ended for mainstream games in the early 2000s with a few exceptions such as &quot;Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War&quot; released in 2006, &quot;Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars&quot; released in 2007, &quot;Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure&quot; released in 2014, &quot;Her Story&quot; released in 2015, the 2015 reboot of &quot;Need for Speed&quot;, and &quot;Obduction&quot; released in 2016.

== Formats ==
The early 1980s saw the almost exclusive use of the Laserdisc for FMV games. Many arcade games used the technology but it was ultimately considered a fad and fell out of use. At least one arcade game, &quot;NFL Football&quot; from Bally/Midway, used CEDs to play its video. Some 1970s era Nintendo games used film and projectors. formats had the advantage of offering full frame video and sound without the quality problems of compressed video that would plague later formats like CDs.

With the re-popularization of FMV games in the early 1990s following the advent of CD-ROM, higher-end developers usually created their own custom FMV formats to suit their needs. Early FMV titles used game-specific proprietary video renderers optimized for the content of the video (e.g., live-action vs. animated), because CPUs of the day were incapable of playing back real-time MPEG-1 until the fastest 486 and Pentium CPUs arrived. Consoles, on the other hand, either used a third-party codec (e.g., Cinepak for Sega CD games) or used their own proprietary format (e.g. the Philips CD-i). Video quality steadily increased as CPUs became more powerful to support higher quality video compression and decompression. &quot;The 7th Guest&quot;, one of the first megahit multiple-CD-ROM games, was one of the first games to feature transparent quality 640x320 FMV at 15 frames per second in a custom format designed by programmer Graeme Devine.

Other examples of this would be Sierra&#x27;s VMD (Video and Music Data) format, used in games like &quot;Gabriel Knight 2&quot; and &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot;, or Westwood Studios&#x27; VQA format, used in most Westwood games made from the mid-1990s up until 2000s &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun Firestorm&quot;. These video formats initially offered very limited video quality, due to the limitations of the machines the games needed to run on. Ghosting and distortion of high-motion scenes, heavy pixelization, and limited color palettes were prominent visual problems. However, each game pushed the technological envelope and was typically seen as impressive even with quality issues.

&quot;Johnny Mnemonic: The Interactive Action Movie&quot;, was the first FMV title made by a Hollywood studio. Sony Imagesoft spent over $3 million on the title. Instead of piecing together the title with filmed assets from their movie (directed by Robert Longo) of the same name, Sony hired Propaganda Code director Douglas Gayeton to write and film an entirely new storyline for the property. The CD-ROM&#x27;s interactivity was made possible with the Cine-Active engine, based on the QuickTime 2.0 codec.

&quot;Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger&quot; was one of the most significant FMV titles made in 1994, featuring big-name Hollywood actors. The video quality in the game suffered significantly from the aforementioned problems and was almost visually indecipherable in parts; however, this did not stop the title from earning significant praise for its innovative gameplay/FMV combination. Its sequel, &quot;Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom&quot;, used a similar custom movie codec in its CD-ROM release, but a later limited-volume DVD-ROM release saw MPEG-2 DVD-quality movies that far exceeded the original CD release in quality. A hardware decoder card was required at the time to play back the DVD-quality video on a PC. Wing Commander IV was also the first game to have used actual film (rather than video tape) to record the FMV scenes which attributed to the ability to create a DVD-quality transfer.

An exception to the rule was &quot;The 11th Hour&quot;, the sequel to &quot;The 7th Guest&quot;. &quot;11th Hour&quot; featured 640×480 FMV at 30 frames-per-second on 4 CDs. The development team had worked for three years on developing a format that could handle the video, as the director of the live-action sequences had not shot the FMV sequences in a way that could be easily compressed. However, this proved to be the game&#x27;s downfall, as most computers of the day could not play the full-resolution video. Users were usually forced to select an option which played the videos at a quarter-size resolution in black-and-white.

As FMV established itself in the market as a growing game technology, a small company called RAD Game Tools appeared on the market with their 256-color FMV format Smacker. Developers took to the format, and the format ended up being used in over 3,000, largely PC-based games.
With the launch of consoles with built-in optical storage (the Sega Saturn and Sony&#x27;s PlayStation) console manufacturers began more actively taking it upon themselves to provide higher quality FMV capabilities to developers. Sony included optimizations in their hardware for their MDEC (motion decompression) technology, and Sega chose the software route. Sega worked both internally on optimizing technology such as Cinepak, and externally by licensing video decompression technology from the New York-based Duck Corporation. While Duck&#x27;s offering won praise for its quality (showcased in games like &quot;Enemy Zero&quot;, major Launch titles in the US and the Saturn adaptations of console hits from the Sega AM2 arcade group) the opaque licensing and royalty structure impeded widespread adoption outside of Japanese and larger US developers.

Duck&#x27;s TrueMotion technology was extended to the PC and Macintosh as well, showcased in the high-profile &quot;Star Trek: Borg&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Klingon&quot;, &quot;The X-Files Game&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, and the highly anticipated sequel to &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot;, &quot;&quot; and other titles. It was reported that versions for PlayStation and GameCube were developed, but the last console version released was for Sega&#x27;s short-lived Dreamcast.

As the popularity of games loaded with live-action and FMV faded out in the late 1990s, and with Smacker becoming outdated in the world of 16-bit color games, RAD introduced a new true-color format, Bink video. Developers quickly took to the format because of its high compression ratios and videogame-tailored features. The format is still one of the most popular FMV formats used in games today. 4,000 games have used Bink, and the number is still growing.

In the late &#x27;90s, Duck largely shelved its support for the console market (likely fueled by the direct support for DVD support in newer generation consoles) and focused its formats instead on internet delivered video. Duck went public as On2 Technologies and later generations of its technology was licensed by Adobe, Skype and was eventually bought (along with the company) by Google as the foundation for WebM. An early open source version of that work also appears as the renamed Theora codec of the Xiph Project.

Windows Media Video, DivX, Flash Video, Theora and WebM are also now major players in the market. DivX is used in several GameCube games, including &quot;Star Wars Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike&quot;.

<doc id="420537" wikidata="Q310150" url="?curid=420537" title="Stewart Granger">
<text>Stewart Granger (born James Lablache Stewart; 6 May 1913 – 16 August 1993) was a British film actor, mainly associated with heroic and romantic leading roles. He was a popular leading man from the 1940s to the early 1960s, rising to fame through his appearances in the Gainsborough melodramas.

==Early life==
He was born James Lablache Stewart in Old Brompton Road, Kensington, west London, the only son of Major James Stewart, OBE and his wife Frederica Eliza (née Lablache). Granger was educated at Epsom College and the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in South Kensington. He was the great-great-grandson of the Italian-French-Irish opera singer Luigi Lablache and the grandson of the actor Luigi Lablache.

Granger lived in Bournemouth at 57 Grove Road with his mother. His mother owned the property now called East Cliff Cottage Hotel until 1979. 
When he became an actor, he was advised to change his name in order to avoid being confused with the American actor James Stewart. Granger was his Scottish grandmother&#x27;s maiden name. Offscreen friends and colleagues continued to call him Jimmy for the rest of his life, but to the general public he became Stewart Granger.

==Career==
===Early work 1933–1940===
Granger made his film debut as an extra in 1933, starting with &quot;The Song You Gave Me&quot; (1933). He can also be glimpsed in &quot;Give Her a Ring&quot; (1933), &quot;Over the Garden Wall&quot; (1934) and &quot;A Southern Maid&quot; (1934). It was at this time that he met the actor Michael Wilding, and they remained friends until Wilding&#x27;s death in 1979.

Years of theatre work followed, initially at Hull Repertory Theatre and then, after a pay dispute, at Birmingham Repertory Theatre. Here he met Elspeth March, a leading actress with the company, who became his first wife. His productions at Birmingham included &quot;The Courageous Sex&quot; and &quot;Victoria, Queen and Empress&quot;; he also acted at the Malvern Festival in &quot;The Millionairess&quot; and &quot;The Apple Cart&quot; and was in the movie &quot;Under Secret Orders&quot; (1937).

Granger began to get work on stage in London. He appeared in &quot;The Sun Never Sets&quot; (1938) at the Drury Lane Theatre and in &quot;Serena Blandish&quot; (1938) opposite Vivien Leigh.

At the Buxton Festival, he played Tybalt in a production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; opposite Robert Donat and Constance Cummings. He also acted opposite them in &quot;The Good Natured Man&quot;. In London he was in &quot;Autumn&quot; with Flora Robson and &quot;The House in the Square&quot; (1940).

Granger had small roles in the movies &quot;So This Is London&quot; (1939) and &quot;Convoy&quot; (1940).

====War service and after 1940–1943====
At the outbreak of the Second World War, Granger enlisted in the Gordon Highlanders, then transferred to the Black Watch with the rank of second lieutenant. However he suffered from stomach ulcers and was invalided out of the army in 1942.

Granger had a small role in the war movie &quot;Secret Mission&quot; (1942) and a bigger one in a comedy, &quot;Thursday&#x27;s Child&quot; (1943). He was in a stage production of &quot;Rebecca&quot; when he was asked to audition for the film that turned him into a star. Granger had been recommended by Donat, who most recently worked with Granger on stage in &quot;To Dream Again&quot;.

===Stardom===
====Gainsborough melodramas 1943–1946====

Granger&#x27;s first starring film role was as the acid-tongued Rokeby in the Gainsborough Pictures period melodrama &quot;The Man in Grey&quot; (1943), a movie that helped to make him and his three co-stars – James Mason, Phyllis Calvert and Margaret Lockwood – box-office names in Britain.

Granger followed it with &quot;The Lamp Still Burns&quot; (1943), playing the love interest of nurse Rosamund John. More popular was &quot;Fanny by Gaslight&quot; (1944), another for Gainsborough Pictures, which reunited him with Calvert and Mason, and added Jean Kent. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Granger &quot;is a young man worth watching. The customers... like his dark looks and his dash; he puts them in mind, they say of Cary Grant.&quot; It was the second most popular movie at the British box office in 1944.

Another hit was &quot;Love Story&quot; (1944), where he plays a blind pilot who falls in love with terminally ill Margaret Lockwood, with Patricia Roc co-starring. Granger filmed this at the same time as &quot;Waterloo Road&quot; (1945), playing his first villain, a &quot;spiv&quot; who has run off with the wife of the John Mills character. This movie was popular too, and it was one of Granger&#x27;s favourites. He was too busy to accept a role offered in &quot;The Way to the Stars&quot;.

&quot;Madonna of the Seven Moons&quot; (1945), with Calvert and Roc, was more Gainsborough melodrama, and another hit. Also popular was &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;, supporting Claude Rains and Vivien Leigh; this movie lost money because of its high production cost but was widely seen, and was the first of Granger&#x27;s movies to be a hit in the U.S. At the end of 1945 British exhibitors voted Granger the second most popular British film star, and the ninth most popular overall. &quot;The Times&quot; reported that &quot;this six-foot black-visaged ex-soldier from the Black Watch is England&#x27;s Number One pin up boy. Only Bing Crosby can match him for popularity.&quot;

&quot;Caravan&quot; (1946), starring Granger and Kent, was the sixth most popular movie at the British box office in 1946. Also well liked was &quot;The Magic Bow&quot; (1946), with Calvert and Kent, where Granger played Niccolò Paganini. That year he was voted the third most popular British star, and the sixth most popular overall. James Mason wrote about Granger in his memoir, saying &quot;although he seemed to get as much fun from a spot of producer-baiting as anyone I ever worked with, he was deeply conscientious and had a load of theatrical talent. He should have made himself a producer and/or director.&quot;

====Rank Organisation 1947–1949====
Granger went over to Rank, for whom he made a series of historical dramas: &quot;Captain Boycott&quot; (1947), set in Ireland, directed by Frank Launder; &quot;Blanche Fury&quot; (1948), with Valerie Hobson; and &quot;Saraband for Dead Lovers&quot; (1948), an Ealing Studios production. Granger was cast as the outsider, the handsome gambler Philip Christoph von Königsmarck who is perceived as &#x27;not quite the ticket&#x27; by the established order, the Hanoverian court where the action is mostly set. Granger stated that this was one of his few movies of which he was proud. However it was a disappointment at the box office, as was &quot;Blanche Fury&quot;.

Granger wanted a change of pace and so appeared in &quot;Woman Hater&quot; (1948), a comedy with Edwige Feuillère. In 1949, Granger was reported as earning around £30,000 a year.

That year Granger made &quot;Adam and Evelyne&quot;, starring with Jean Simmons. The story, about a much older man and a teenager whom he gradually realises is no longer a child but a young woman with mature emotions and sexuality, had obvious parallels to Granger&#x27;s and Simmons&#x27; own lives. Granger had first met the young Jean Simmons when they both worked on Gabriel Pascal&#x27;s &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; (1945). Three years later, Simmons had transformed from a promising newcomer into a star. They married the following year in a bizarre wedding ceremony organised by Howard Hughes: One of his private aircraft flew the couple to Tucson, Arizona, where they were married, mainly among strangers, with Michael Wilding as Granger&#x27;s best man.

Granger&#x27;s stage production of Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;The Power of Darkness&quot; (a venture he had intended as a vehicle for him to star with Jean Simmons) was very poorly received when it opened in London at the Lyric Theatre on 25 April 1949. During the run, two men attempted to cut some locks from Granger&#x27;s hair. The disappointment added to his dissatisfaction with the Rank Organisation, and his thoughts turned to Hollywood.

According to Alan Wood, historian, &quot;Granger, annoyed because his name was not billed sufficiently prominently in posters for &quot;Saraband for Dead Lovers&quot;, had asked to be released from his contract, and Rank agreed to let him go; box-office results for his latest British films had been disappointing.&quot;

===American career===
====MGM 1950–1957====

In 1949 Granger made his move; MGM was looking for someone to play H. Rider Haggard&#x27;s hero Allan Quatermain in a movie version of &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;. Errol Flynn was offered the role but turned it down; Granger&#x27;s signing was announced in August 1949.

On the basis of the huge success of this movie, released in 1950 and co-starring Deborah Kerr and Richard Carlson, he was offered a seven-year contract by MGM. He signed it in May 1950, and MGM announced three vehicles for him: &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, a remake of &quot;Scaramouche&quot; and an adaptation of &quot;Soldiers Three&quot;.

His first movie under the new arrangement was an action comedy, &quot;Soldiers Three&quot; (1951). Granger followed it with location work for &quot;Constable Pedley&quot; in Canada. This was put on hold so Granger could make a light comedy, &quot;The Light Touch&quot;, in a role meant for Cary Grant. It was a box office disappointment. However filming resumed on &quot;Constable Pedley&quot; which became &quot;The Wild North&quot; (1953) and that was a big hit.

In 1952, Granger starred in &quot;Scaramouche&quot; in the role of Andre Moreau, the bastard son of a French nobleman, a part Ramón Novarro had played in the 1923 version of Rafael Sabatini&#x27;s novel. Granger&#x27;s co-star Eleanor Parker said Granger was the only actor she did not get along with during her entire career. &quot;Everyone disliked this man...Stewart Granger was a dreadful person, rude...just awful. Just being in his presence was bad. I thought at one point the crew was going to kill him.&quot; However, the resulting movie was a notable critical and commercial success.

After this came the remake of &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1952), for which his theatrical voice, stature (6&#x27;2&quot;) and dignified profile made him a natural. It too was popular.

In 1952 he and Jean Simmons sued Howard Hughes for $250,000 damages arising from an alleged breach of contract. The case was settled out of court.

Columbia borrowed him to play the love interest of Rita Hayworth in &quot;Salome&quot; (1953), another big hit. Back at MGM he co-starred with his wife in &quot;Young Bess&quot; (1953), playing Thomas Seymour. The movie was popular, though it did not recover its cost, and it remained a favourite of Granger&#x27;s.

He had a commercial success in &quot;All the Brothers Were Valiant&quot; (1953), playing a villain opposite Robert Taylor. Granger lost the role in &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, which went to James Mason. He had the title role in &quot;Beau Brummell&quot; (1954), opposite Elizabeth Taylor, and it was a box-office disappointment. More successful was the adventure story &quot;Green Fire&quot; (1954), co starring Grace Kelly.

Granger went to Britain to make &quot;Footsteps in the Fog&quot; (1955), a movie with Simmons, for Columbia. Back at MGM, he was in &quot;Moonfleet&quot; (1955), cast as adventurer Jeremy Fox in the Dorset of 1757, a man who rules a gang of cut-throat smugglers with an iron fist until he is softened by a 10-year-old boy who worships him and who believes only the best of him. The film was directed by Fritz Lang and produced by John Houseman, a former associate of Orson Welles. It was a flop.

Granger and Robert Taylor were reunited in &quot;The Last Hunt&quot; (1956), a Western, with Taylor playing the villain, and a box office disappointment. So too was &quot;Bhowani Junction&quot; (1956), adapted from a John Masters novel about colonial India on the verge of obtaining independence. Ava Gardner played an Anglo-Indian (mixed race) woman caught between the two worlds of the British and the Indians, and Granger the British officer with whom (in a change from the novel) she ultimately fell in love.

Granger was teamed with Gardner and David Niven in a three-hander, &quot;The Little Hut&quot; (1957), a sex farce that proved a surprise smash at the box office. He followed it with &quot;Gun Glory&quot; (1957), his last movie under his MGM contract. Granger reportedly turned down the role of Messala in the 1959 film &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, apparently because he did not want to take second billing to Charlton Heston.

====Leaving MGM 1957–1960====
Granger had become a successful cattle rancher. He bought land in New Mexico and Arizona and introduced Charolais cattle to America. In order to finance his ranch he kept acting. He played a professional adventurer in &quot;Harry Black&quot; (1958), partly shot in India. He went to Britain to be in the thriller &quot;The Whole Truth&quot; (1958) for Romulus, for whom he was to make &quot;The Nightcomers&quot; but it never was filmed.

He returned to Los Angeles to support John Wayne and Capucine in &quot;North to Alaska&quot; (1960). By now his marriage to Simmons had ended, and Granger relocated to Europe.

===Later career===
====Continental European career 1960–1969====
In June 1960, Granger announced he would appear in &quot;The Leopard&quot;; two movies for MGM in Britain, one of which was &quot;I Thank a Fool&quot; alongside Susan Hayward; &quot;Pontius Pilate&quot; for Hugo Fregonese; and &quot;The Tumbled House&quot; for John Farrow. The role in &quot;The Leopard&quot; ultimately went to Burt Lancaster, the one in &quot;I Thank a Fool&quot; to Peter Finch, and the Fregonese and Farrow movies were never made. Granger did go to Britain to appear in the thriller &quot;The Secret Partner&quot; (1961) for MGM.

He went to Italy and played Lot in Robert Aldrich&#x27;s &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah&quot; (1962), filmed in Rome. When &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah&quot; started filming, Granger announced he had signed a three-picture deal with MGM, which would include &quot;I Thank a Fool&quot;, &quot;Swordsman of Siena&quot; and a third movie for Jacques Bar. He also announced he had reactivated his production company, Tracy Productions, which was scheduled to make &quot;Dark Memory&quot; by Jonathan Latimer. Granger did not appear in &quot;I Thank a Fool&quot;, and &quot;Dark Memory&quot; was not made. Instead Granger stayed in Italy to make &quot;Commando&quot; (1962), an action movie and &quot;Swordsman of Siena&quot; (1963), a swashbuckler. Granger was in the war movie &quot;The Secret Invasion&quot; (1964) for Roger Corman, shot in Yugoslavia.

In West Germany, Granger acted in the role of Old Surehand in three Western movies adapted from novels by German author Karl May, with French actor Pierre Brice (playing the fictional Indian chief Winnetou), in &quot;Among Vultures&quot; (1964), with Elke Sommer; &quot;The Oil Prince&quot; (1965) (&quot;Rampage at Apache Wells&quot;) (1965), shot in Yugoslavia; and &quot;Old Surehand&quot; (&quot;Flaming Frontier&quot;) (1965). He was teamed with Brice and Lex Barker, also a hero of Karl May movies, in the crime movie &quot;Killer&#x27;s Carnival&quot; (1966).

Granger starred in several Eurospy movies such as &quot;Red Dragon&quot; (1965), a West German-Italian movie shot in Hong Kong; and &quot;Requiem for a Secret Agent&quot; (1966). He did &quot;The Crooked Road&quot; (1965), with Robert Ryan under the direction of Don Chaffey in Yugoslavia; &quot;Target for Killing&quot; (1966), a crime movie with Karin Dor; and &quot;The Trygon Factor&quot; (1966), a British co-production based on a novel by Edgar Wallace.

Granger&#x27;s last studio picture was &quot;The Last Safari&quot; (1967), shot in Africa and directed by Henry Hathaway. Granger was billed under Kaz Garas. He later called this &quot;my last real film...the worst film ever made in Africa!&quot;

In 1970, he described his recent movies as &quot;movies not even I will talk about&quot;. He later estimated that he made more than $1.5 million in the 1960s but lost all of it.

===U.S. television===
Granger returned to the U.S. and made a TV movie, &quot;Any Second Now&quot; (1969).

In 1970, he appeared as Colonial Mackenzie on &quot;The Men from Shiloh&quot;, a re-tooling of the long-running NBC Western series &quot;The Virginian&quot;. Wardrobes and hairstyles were updated, Doug McClure grew a mustache, as did Lee Majors (who joined the show along with Granger), making the actors more dashing and realistic for the time. Granger followed Lee J. Cobb, Charles Bickford, and John McIntire as the new owner of the Shiloh ranch on prime-time TV for its ninth season (1971). Granger said he accepted the role for the money and because it &quot;seemed like it could be a lot of fun&quot;, but was disappointed at what he perceived as a lack of character development for his role. He went on to play Sherlock Holmes in a poorly received 1972 TV film version of &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;.

===Retirement===
In the 1970s, Granger retired from acting and went to live in southern Spain, where he invested in real estate and resided in Estepona, Málaga. While living there, he became a friend and business partner of former barrister and television producer James Todesco (&quot;Eldorado&quot; TV series). Together they were involved in real estate investment and development.

He appeared in his last major film, the 1978 hit &quot;The Wild Geese&quot;, as an unscrupulous banker who hires a unit of mercenary soldiers including (Richard Harris, Roger Moore, and Richard Burton) to stage a military coup in an African nation. His character then makes a deal with the existing government, and betrays the mercenaries.

In 1980, he was diagnosed with lung cancer and was told he had three months to live. Granger later said, &quot;I was 67 and had smoked 60 cigarettes a day for 40 years, but the doctor said if I had an operation there might be a chance of two to four more years of life. So I said, &#x27;Who the hell needs that? But you better give me three months to put my house in order&#x27;.&quot; Granger underwent the operation, having a lung and a rib removed, only to be informed he did not have cancer after all but tuberculosis.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1980 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the New London Theatre.

===Return to acting===
Granger returned to acting in 1981 with the publication of his autobiography &quot;Sparks Fly Upward&quot;, claiming he was bored. Granger spent the last decade of his life appearing on stage and television including playing Prince Philip in &quot;The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana&quot; (1982), a guest role in the hit TV series &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; with his &quot;Men From Shiloh&quot; co-star Lee Majors, and as a suspect in &quot;Murder She Wrote&quot; in 1985. He starred in a German soap-opera, &quot;Das Erbe der Guldenburgs&quot; (The Guldenburg Heritage) (1987).

He moved to Pacific Palisades, California.

One of his later roles was in the 1989–1990 Broadway production of &quot;The Circle&quot; by W. Somerset Maugham, opposite Glynis Johns and Rex Harrison in Harrison&#x27;s final role. The production opened at Duke University for a three-week run, followed by performances in Baltimore and Boston, then opened on 14 November 1989 on Broadway.
In 1990 he toured Europe in &quot;The Circle&quot;, opposite Ian Carmichael and Rosemary Harris.

==Personal life, death, and honours==
Granger was married three times and had four children:
* Elspeth March (married 1938–1948); two children, Jamie and Lindsay
* Jean Simmons (married 1950–1960), (with whom he had starred in &quot;Adam and Evelyne&quot;, &quot;Young Bess&quot; and &quot;Footsteps in the Fog&quot;); one daughter, Tracy
* Caroline LeCerf (married 1964–1969); one daughter, Samantha.

Granger wrote in his autobiography that Deborah Kerr approached him romantically in the back of his chauffeur-driven car at the time he was making &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;. Although he was married to Elspeth March, he stated that he and Kerr went on to have an affair. When asked about this revelation, Kerr&#x27;s response was, &quot;What a gallant man he is.&quot;

In 1956, Granger became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

Granger died in Santa Monica, California on August 16, 1993, from prostate and bone cancer at the age of 80.

His niece is &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; appraiser Bunny Campione (born Carolyn Elizabeth Fisher), the daughter of his sister Iris.

There is a street named after Granger in San Antonio, Texas.

==Appraisal==
In 1970, Granger said, &quot;Stewart Granger was quite a successful film star, but I don&#x27;t think he was an actor&#x27;s actor.&quot;

Among the movies that Granger was announced to star in but went on to be made with other actors were &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1952), &quot;Mogambo&quot; (1953), &quot;The King&#x27;s Thief&quot; (1955), and &quot;Man of the West&quot; (1958).

<text>Sir James Michael Goldsmith (26 February 1933 – 18 July 1997) was a French-British financier, tycoon and politician who was a member of the Goldsmith family.

His controversial business and finance career led to ongoing clashes with British media, frequently involving litigation or the threat of litigation.

In 1994 he was elected to represent a French constituency as a Member of the European Parliament. He founded the short-lived Eurosceptic Referendum Party in the United Kingdom, which became an early campaigner for opposition to Britain&#x27;s membership of the European Union.

==Early life==
Born in Paris, Goldsmith was the son of luxury hotel tycoon and former Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Major Frank Goldsmith and his French wife, Marcelle Mouiller, and younger brother of environmental campaigner Edward Goldsmith. Frank Goldsmith had previously changed the family name from the German &quot;Goldschmidt&quot; to the English &quot;Goldsmith&quot;. The Goldschmidts, neighbours and rivals of the Rothschild family, were a wealthy, Frankfurt-based, Jewish family that had been influential in international merchant banking since the 16th century. James&#x27;s great-grandfather was Benedikt Hayum Goldschmidt, founder of the bank and consul to the Grand Duke of Tuscany. James&#x27;s grandfather was Adolphe Benedict Goldschmidt (1838–1918), a multi-millionaire who moved to London in 1895.

Raised initially in Paris, James Goldsmith had to flee France with his family when Nazi Germany overran the country in 1940, only just managing to escape on the last over-loaded ship from the French port of exit, leaving behind their hotels and much of their property. After that the family relocated to the Bahamas, and Goldsmith was sent to school in Canada, where he founded a business trapping small furbearing animals such as rabbits, skunk and mink. He also attended Millfield and Eton College, which he left early in 1949 at the age of 16, after winning £8,000 () on a horse racing bet of £10 () for a three-horse accumulator at Lewes. With the money, he decided that he should leave Eton immediately; in a speech at his boarding house, he declared that &quot;a man of my means should not remain a schoolboy!&quot; He then took over a business in Paris from his brother Teddy, which sold a cure for rheumatism and electrical plugs and sockets.

Goldsmith served as a Gunner in the British Army&#x27;s Royal Artillery under the National Service requirements, during which time he received a commission as an officer.

==Business career==

During the 1950s and 60s, Goldsmith&#x27;s involvement in finance and as an industrialist involved many risks, and brought him close to bankruptcy several times. His successes included winning the British franchise for Alka-Seltzer and introducing low-cost generic drugs to the UK. He was described in the tabloid press as a greenmail corporate raider and asset stripper, a categorisation he denied vigorously. He claimed the re-organizations he undertook streamlined the operations, removed complacent inefficient management, and increased shareholder value.

Having taken on the management of the Paris business handed on by his brother Teddy, Goldsmith organised a publicity stunt involving an arthritic racehorse. Sales escalated in response and, within a couple of years, the staff had been expanded from two to over a hundred. Goldsmith took on the agency for various slimming remedies and branched out into the manufacture of generic prescription drugs. His acquisition of the distributorship for Slimcea and Procea low-calorie breads was the start of the shift of focus towards the food industry. In the early 1960s, in partnership with Selim Zilkha, Goldsmith founded the Mothercare retail chain, but sold out his share to Zilkha who went on to develop it with great success.

With the financial backing of Sir Isaac Wolfson, he acquired diverse food companies quoted on the London Stock Exchange as Cavenham Foods in 1965. Initially, the group had an annual turnover of £27m and negligible profits. He added bakeries and then confectioners to the group, and then took over a number of wholesalers and retailers, including small chains of tobacco, confectioner and newsagent shops. By rationalising the activities, closing inefficient factories, and improving the management practices, he steadily improved productivity. By 1971, the turnover was £35m and profits were up to £2m.

In June 1971, he launched a bid for Bovril, which was a much larger company with a diverse portfolio including several strong brands (including Marmite, Ambrosia, Virol and Jaffajuice), dairies and dairy farms, and cattle ranches in Argentina. It was run by the third generation of the founding family and Goldsmith concluded that they were ineffectual. The bid was strongly contested and Goldsmith was fiercely attacked by the financial press. The directors tried to induce Beechams and Rowntree Mackintosh to make rival offers but, in the end, they both withdrew.

After the successful bid, Goldsmith sold the dairies and farms to Max Joseph&#x27;s Express Dairies group for £5.3m, and found buyers in South America for the ranches. Sales of other parts of the company recouped almost all of the £13m that the acquisition had cost him. Some years later, he sold the brand names to Beecham for £36m. Later, he took over Allied Distributors, who owned a miscellaneous portfolio of grocery stores and small chains, including the Lipton shops. As journalists began to question his techniques of dealing with the funds and assets of publicly quoted companies, Goldsmith began dealing through private companies registered in the UK and abroad. These included the French company Générale Occidentale and Hong Kong and then Cayman-registered General Oriental Investments.

In early 1973, Goldsmith travelled to New York to assess US business opportunities, followed by a tour round Central and South America. He took the view that the UK economy was due for a downturn and began aggressively liquidating many of his assets. In December that year, in the midst of financial chaos, he announced that he had acquired a 51% controlling stake in Grand Union, one of the oldest retailing conglomerates in the US. He set Jim Wood – who had revitalised his British retail operations – to work on rationalising the operations of the chain, but ran into continuous obstruction from both unions and management.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Goldsmith received financing from the banking arm of the conglomerate Slater Walker, of which he succeeded founder Jim Slater as chairman following the company&#x27;s collapse and rescue by the Bank of England in the secondary banking crisis of 1973–75.

Goldsmith was knighted in the 1976 resignation honours – the so-called &quot;Lavender List&quot; – of Prime Minister Harold Wilson. In early 1980, he formed a partnership with longtime friend and merchant banker Sir Roland Franklin. Franklin managed Goldsmith&#x27;s business in the Americas. From 1983 until 1988, Goldsmith, via takeovers in America, built a private holding company, Cavenham Forest Industries, which became one of the largest private owners of timberland and one of the top-five timber-holding companies of any type in America. Goldsmith and Franklin identified a quirk in American accounting whereby companies with substantial timberland holdings would often carry them on their balance sheets at a nominal valuation (as the result of years of depreciation).

Goldsmith, a reader of financial statements, realised that in the case of Crown Zellerbach the underlying value of the timberland assets alone, carried at only $12.5m on the balance sheet, was worth more than the target company&#x27;s total market capitalisation of around $900m. 
With this insight, Goldsmith began raids that left him with a holding company owning huge tracts of timberland acquired at virtually no net cost. The majority of the pulp and paper assets were sold in 1986 to James River Corporation, which in turn became a part of Georgia-Pacific in 2000. (The brown paper container division became Gaylord Container).

Additionally, in 1986, Goldsmith&#x27;s companies reportedly made $90 million from an attempted hostile takeover of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, although he regarded this profit as an inadequate consolation for the failure to carry the bid through to a successful conclusion. The management of the company coordinated a virulent campaign against Goldsmith, involving unions, the press, and politicians at state and federal level.

Goldsmith retired to Mexico in 1987, having anticipated the market crash that year and liquidated his assets. However, he continued corporate raiding, including an attempt on British-American Tobacco in 1989 (for which he joined Kerry Packer and Jacob Rothschild). He also swapped his American timber assets for a 49.9 percent stake in Newmont Mining and remained on the board of Newmont until he liquidated his stake through open-market trades in 1993. He had been precluded by the original purchase of Newmont from acquiring a controlling shareholding in the company. In 1990, Goldsmith also began a lower-profile, but also profitable, global &quot;private equity style&quot; investment operation. By 1994, executives working in his employ in Hong Kong had built a substantial position in the intermediation of global strategic raw-material flows.

A large Hong Kong-linked and Goldsmith-funded stake in one of the world&#x27;s largest nickel operations, INCO Indonesia, was also disclosed in the 1990s, showing Goldsmith&#x27;s ability to position capital before a trend became obvious to others. The group was also a major backer of the Hong Kong-based and Singapore listed major raw material player Noble Group, with low-profile long-time Goldsmith protégé Tobias Brown serving for many years as the company&#x27;s non-executive chairman.

==Goldsmith and the press==
Goldsmith attracted little attention until he became embroiled in a damaging dispute with anti-establishment satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;. In 1976 &quot;Private Eye&quot; accused Goldsmith of being part of what amounted to a conspiracy to obstruct the course of justice in relation to the fugitive Lord Lucan, who was wanted for the murder of his children&#x27;s nanny. The article falsely stated that Goldsmith had participated in a meeting supposedly called by John Aspinall to help Lucan. Goldsmith was a regular at his close friend Aspinall&#x27;s gambling club, the Clermont, where Lucan was one of the house players having their losses written off, rather than a true member. In addition to pursuing a large number of civil lawsuits against the editor of the magazine and a journalist who was also a TV researcher and regarding them as dangerous subversives, Goldsmith sought to bring a criminal libel prosecution, though there had not been one for half a century. Through his actions Goldsmith formed an unlikely friendship with the Labour Party&#x27;s then Prime Minister Harold Wilson who loathed &quot;Private Eye&quot;. The access to Wilson aided Goldsmith when, to the horror of Bank of England officials, he became head of the troubled Slater Walker, and this is said to have been the reason for his knighthood. The costly libel suits were eventually settled by Goldsmith, but he was subsequently dogged by disparaging commentary from a wide range of British media.

In November 1977, there were two editions of &quot;The Money Programme&quot; on BBC; the first gave a critical account of Goldsmith&#x27;s business history and methods. In the second programme a combative Goldsmith appeared in person and countered the implication of asset stripping by pointing to an investment of over a hundred million pounds his company was making to upgrade their going concerns.

In 1977 Goldsmith bought the French weekly &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot; and between 1979 and 1981 published the UK news magazine &quot;NOW!&quot; which never met circulation targets and incurred heavy losses. After 84 issues, Goldsmith closed it in early May 1981.

In 1999 an episode of &quot;The Mayfair Set&quot;, a BBC television documentary series by filmmaker Adam Curtis, portrayed the by then deceased Goldsmith as a playboy, speculator and deluded victim of the success as a corporate raider that made him one of the world&#x27;s richest men.

==Into politics==
Goldsmith had become increasingly concerned throughout the 1980s about the nature of the European Economic Community (EEC), and harboured a deepening suspicion that at its core lay a desire for the domination of the European continent by Germany, a suspicion which was for him confirmed further when in 1992, via the passage of the Maastricht Treaty, the EEC re-titled itself as the European Union, with dramatically centralising governmental powers being enacted over its constituent member nations.

In March 1993 Goldsmith gave a televised lecture publicly declaring opposition to the European Union, which was transmitted across the United Kingdom on Channel 4 Television as part of its &quot;Opinions&quot; political commentary series, the text of which was published in &quot;The Times&quot; the following day under the title &quot;Creating a Superstate is the way to destroy Europe&quot;. In the mid-1990s he financially supported a Eurosceptic think tank entitled the European Foundation.

In 1994 he published &quot;The Trap&quot;, a book detailing his broader political philosophical thoughts, giving a critique of the dominance of neoliberalism in the governments of the First World. In its text he criticised their ideological dogmatic pursuance of free trade, and the facilitation of the American &quot;melting pot&quot; societal model being copied by the rest of the First World&#x27;s governments through mass foreign migration, driven by a pursuance of short-term economic advantage, which he posited was fatally flawed in societal concept and brought with it great societal dangers. As an economic alternative he espoused a restoration of classical liberalism, and a return to mercantilism. He also advocated the prevention by governmental action of mass migrations by populations from poorer areas of the globe into the First World driven by economic motivation, which he foresaw as an inevitability of escalating Third World population demographics and First World governmental neoliberal and socialist ideologies.

In 1994 he was elected in France as a Member of the European Parliament, representing the &quot;Majorité pour l&#x27;autre Europe&quot; party, and subsequently became the leader of the eurosceptic Europe of Nations group within the European Parliament.

===Referendum Party===

In the early 1990s, with the removal of Margaret Thatcher from the United Kingdom&#x27;s Prime Ministerial office by the Tories, and their enactment into law of the Maastricht Treaty, Goldsmith, who up until that time had retained close links with the Conservative Party, came to the conclusion that it was no longer a serious political vehicle to oppose the European Union&#x27;s advancing power, and that opposition would have to be created within the party political system beyond its current order of the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrats parties, all of which supported the United Kingdom&#x27;s incorporation into the European Union.

In consequence, in 1994 Goldsmith founded and financed the Referendum Party in the United Kingdom, modelled upon the &quot;Majorité pour l&#x27;autre Europe&quot;, with the objective of seeking a referendum for its national withdrawal from the European Union, which would go on to stand candidates in the country&#x27;s general election of 1997. As the mid-1990s progressed Goldsmith involved himself in British politics, appearing with increasing regularity in the political press, and in domestic political televised debates, raising opposition to the nature of the European Union and what he perceived was mainstream media culpability in playing down its supranational ambitions, and pouring scorn on a Westminster parliamentary political order that he stated had failed the nation and was now wilfully betraying its governmental sovereignty.

During the 1997 electoral campaign Goldsmith had mailed to approximately five million homes a VHS video cassette film to allow him to address the electorate free from the editorial control of the nation&#x27;s mainstream media, having previously rejected the idea of by-passing the United Kingdom&#x27;s legal restrictions on the broadcast of political information by the means of an offshore radio station named &quot;Referendum Radio&quot;.

===1997 United Kingdom general election===
At the 1997 general election, Goldsmith stood as a candidate for the Referendum Party in the London constituency of Putney, against the former Conservative minister David Mellor, MP, in an electoral contest in which Goldsmith polled 3.5% of the vote. The declaration of the Putney result, which was televised and nationally broadcast live on the night of 1 May 1997, saw a charged atmosphere at the count, with a rowdy crowd in attendance of anti-European Union activists from the Referendum Party, and the recently inaugurated UK Independence Party (which would itself receive only a couple of hundred votes in Putney that night). An acrimonious confrontation between Mellor (who had lost his seat to the Labour Party candidate) and Goldsmith developed on stage after Mellor, in what was to be his valedictory address from politics, personally insulted Goldsmith&#x27;s candidacy. During the speech, part of the crowd, Goldsmith and some of the other candidates began a gleefully defiant collective repetitive shouting chant of &quot;Out!&quot; in response, in celebration of the perceived substantive damage having been done to a prominent member of the Westminster Parliamentary political order of which they had become so contemptuous.

Goldsmith&#x27;s electoral performance at Putney had been reasonably insubstantial, in a British electoral culture in which it is notoriously difficult for new political parties or maverick politicians to establish themselves. He was also terminally ill during the election, a fact which he had kept secret beyond his closest personal circle, and which had limited his ability to campaign. When interviewed by the BBC&#x27;s Michael Buerk during the count prior to the result being announced, he described his chances as being &quot;extremely low&quot; – the 1,518 votes that his candidacy had garnered had not in itself defeated the incumbent Mellor, who had lost by 2,976 votes; moreover it amounted to less than 5% of the total votes cast, this being insufficient for Goldsmith to retain the candidate&#x27;s financial deposit of £500, a part of the 20 million pounds that he had reportedly poured into the Referendum Party in its brief existence. Mellor had correctly predicted at the count that the Referendum Party was &quot;dead in the water&quot;, and indeed the party did disappear with Goldsmith&#x27;s death two months after the election. However, many of the Referendum Party&#x27;s activists and voters would go on to join and support the nascent UK Independence Party, which would ultimately lead a sea-change in the nation&#x27;s politics, which almost twenty years later would see the United Kingdom vote to leave the European Union in a referendum on the issue.

==Death==
Two months after contesting the 1997 general election, Goldsmith died aged 64, from pancreatic cancer at a farmhouse that he owned in Benahavís, southern Spain, on 18 July 1997.

==Personal life==
Goldsmith was married three times. At 20 he married 17-year-old Bolivian heiress María Isabel Patiño y Borbón, the daughter of tin magnate Antenor Patiño by his wife María Cristina de Borbón y Bosch-Labrús, 3rd . When Goldsmith proposed the marriage to Antenor Patiño, it is alleged his future father-in-law replied, &quot;We are not in the habit of marrying Jews&quot;. Goldsmith is reported to have replied, &quot;Well, I am not in the habit of marrying [Red] Indians&quot;. The story, if true, is typical of Goldsmith&#x27;s attempts at humour. With the heiress pregnant and the Patiños insisting the pair separate, the couple eloped in January 1954. The marriage was brief: rendered comatose by a cerebral haemorrhage in her seventh month of pregnancy, Maria Isabel Patiño de Goldsmith died in May 1954. Her only child was delivered by caesarean section and survived.

Goldsmith next married Ginette Léry, with whom he had a son and daughter. They divorced in 1978 but shared a house in Paris until his death, and he built her a house on his Cuixmala estate.

In 1978 he married his mistress Lady Annabel Birley, by whom he had already had two children, Jemima and Zacharias; they later had a third child, Benjamin. After this marriage, Goldsmith embarked on an affair with Laure Boulay de La Meurthe (granddaughter of Bruno, Count of Harcourt and Princess Isabelle of Orléans), with whom he had two children, including Charlotte Colbert.

<text>Yungchen Lhamo (Tibetan: དབྱངས་ཅན་ལྷ་མོ, &quot;lhamo&quot; meaning &quot;goddess of song&quot;) is a Tibetan singer-songwriter living in the United States. She won the ARIA Award for Best World Music Album in 1995 and was then signed by Peter Gabriel&#x27;s Real World record label.

==Life and career==
Lhamo&#x27;s name means &quot;goddess of song&quot; (&quot;lhamo&quot;), a name given to her by a Buddhist monk at birth.

Lhamo left Tibet in 1989 to make a pilgrimage to Dharamsala. She was inspired to reach out to the world through her music. She moved to Australia in 1993, then to New York City in 2000.

Lhamo&#x27;s Australian debut album, &quot;Tibetan Prayer&quot;, produced by John Prior, won the ARIA Award for Best World Music Album in 1995. The success of that record led to her signing with Peter Gabriel&#x27;s Real World label. Her first record for the label, &quot;Tibet, Tibet&quot;, mainly features &quot;a cappella&quot; renditions of original compositions—authentic Tibetan Buddhist prayers and songs. Her next recording, &quot;Coming Home&quot;, was a collaboration with producer Hector Zazou, showcasing her voice and also featuring chanting by Tibetan monks, a wide range of mostly modern Western instruments and the benefits of multi-track recording which enabled Lhamo&#x27;s voice to be layered repeatedly.

According to the &quot;Times Herald Record&quot;, Lhamo has toured extensively in at least 70 countries, singing a combination of her own songs and traditional Buddhist chants and mantras. She has performed and recorded with other artists, including Natalie Merchant, Peter Gabriel, Annie Lennox, Billy Corgan, and Bono. Lhamo&#x27;s recordings have been used in the film &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; and many Tibetan documentaries. She has performed at venues such as London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall, New York City&#x27;s Carnegie Hall, and Berlin&#x27;s Philharmonic Hall. She has also performed at the Lilith Fair festival and toured as a part of the WOMAD world music festivals.

Lhamo&#x27;s album &quot;Ama&quot; (which means &quot;Mother&quot; in the Tibetan language) was released in April 2006 and was produced by Iranian-American musician Jamshied Sharifi. Featured artists include Annie Lennox on the song &quot;Fade Away&quot; and Joy Askew on the song &quot;Tara&quot;.

In November 2007, Lhamo accompanied a site-specific dance work called &quot;Walking The Line&quot; by American choreographer Bill T. Jones at the Louvre Museum in Paris. The performance, which also featured solo percussion by Florent Jodelet, took place in a 300-foot space stretching from Michelangelo&#x27;s statue &quot;The Dying Slave&quot; to the foot of the staircase leading to the sculpture Winged Victory of Samothrace.

Lhamo&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Tayatha&quot; (meaning &quot;It Is Like This&quot;) was released in June 2013 by Cantaloupe Music. On this album she collaborated with Russian pianist Anton Batagov.

Lhamo&#x27;s work with mentally ill and homeless people was covered by &quot;Newsweek&quot;.

Lhamo released &quot;Awakening Album&quot; which explores the relevance of compassion-based spirituality to our modern-day, interdependent lives – each song reflecting topics that have become ever-more highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Awakening was a collaboration with Julio Garcia produced in Madrid, Spain and features &#x27;Loving Kindness&#x27; track, on which Yungchen is joined by flamenco legend Carmen Linares. Lhamo says: &quot;&#x27;Awakening&#x27; aims to appeal to those who are interested in sound healing and spiritual awakening, and, unlike previous albums, uses only English song titles. It is also my first album to include a song in Mandarin. I truly believe that voice has vibrational energy to connect, empower, heal and transform all human beings. I hope these new songs will help bring inner peace and true happiness to everyone who hears them.&quot;. 

Lhamo has also continued her work with the One Drop of Kindness Foundation, and she has helped to raise millions of dollars for humanitarian projects. In 2023 she released the album &quot;One Drop of Kindness,&quot; co-produced with John Alevizakis.

<text>Edward Stewart Plank (August 31, 1875 – February 24, 1926), nicknamed &quot;Gettysburg Eddie&quot;, was an American professional baseball player. A pitcher, Plank played in Major League Baseball for the Philadelphia Athletics from 1901 through 1914, the St. Louis Terriers in 1915, and the St. Louis Browns in 1916 and 1917.

Plank was the first left-handed pitcher to win 200 games and then 300 games, and now ranks third in all-time wins among left-handers with 326 career victories (13th all time) and first all-time in career shutouts by a left-handed pitcher with 66. Philadelphia went to the World Series five times while Plank played there, but he sat out the 1910 World Series due to an injury. Plank had only a 1.32 earned run average (ERA) in his World Series career, but he was unlucky, with a 2-5 win–loss record in those games.

Plank died of a stroke in 1926. He was posthumously elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946 by the Veterans Committee.

==Early life==
Plank grew up on a farm near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. He was the fourth of seven children born to Martha McCreary and David Plank. His father was a school director and tax collector in Gettysburg. Plank did not play baseball until the age of 17, when he started playing for local teams in the Gettysburg area. He practiced pitching by throwing a baseball against his barn door, drawing lectures from his father for all the dents he left. When Plank was about 22, Frank Foreman, the pitching coach at Gettysburg College, asked him to try out for the school&#x27;s baseball team. History books often erroneously state that Plank graduated from Gettysburg College. He attended Gettysburg Academy, a prep school affiliated with the college. However, he played for the college&#x27;s team without ever being enrolled there.

==Career==
In 1900, Plank signed with the Richmond Colts of the Virginia League, a minor league. The league folded before Plank could pitch for the Colts. However, next May, Foreman recommended Plank to Connie Mack, the manager of the Philadelphia Athletics, who liked what he saw and signed Plank to a contract.
Plank made his major league debut for the Athletics on May 13, 1901. As a rookie, Plank pitched well, posting a 17–13 win–loss record with a 3.31 earned run average (ERA) and 28 complete games in 32 games started. He won 20 games for the first time in his career in 1902, posting a 20–15 record and a 3.30 ERA as the Athletics won the American League (AL) pennant. Only Rube Waddell won more games that year for the Athletics, as Mack pointed out. He won 23 games in 1903 while leading the AL in games started. In 1905, Plank made his first trip to the World Series. He faced Christy Mathewson in the first game and Joe McGinnity in the fourth game. Though Plank gave up only three runs in 17 innings during the series, the Athletics lost to the New York Giants in five games and did not score an earned run in the entire series. The Athletics returned to the World Series in 1910, but Plank was forced to sit out with a sore arm, although newspapers were speculating that he would pitch during the series.

By 1911, Plank was the last member of the Athletics remaining from the 1901 team. The 1911 team made the World Series and faced the Giants again. After Plank won Game Two and lost in a relief appearance in Game Five, the Athletics won the series in six games. In 1913, the Athletics and Giants met again in the World Series, and Plank faced Mathewson in Games Two and Five. Mathewson hit a tenth-inning single off of Plank to set up a Giants victory in Game Two, but Plank and the Athletics bested Mathewson 3–1 in the fifth and deciding game of the series. In 1914, Plank&#x27;s final year with Philadelphia, he went to the World Series again. Plank pitched a complete game in Game Two, but he lost 1–0 and the Boston Braves won the series in four games.

During his tenure in Philadelphia, Plank was one of the most consistent pitchers in the game, winning over 20 games seven times. In the four World Series in which he played, Plank earned a 1.32 ERA but only a 2–5 win–loss record. As Plank was one of the best pitchers on the Athletics, Mack would usually match him up against Christy Mathewson, another Hall of Famer, when the Athletics played the Giants in the World Series. Plank pitched complete games in all six of his World Series starts. His quiet personality led to him getting overshadowed in media coverage by other Athletics pitchers such as Hall of Famers Waddell and Chief Bender, but Plank would win more games than either of these.

In November 1914, it was rumored that Plank would be sold to the New York Highlanders. In December, Plank signed a contract to play in the Federal League. Mack expressed no regret at Plank&#x27;s departure, saying, &quot;I wish him the best of luck... I was through with him. He was after the money. He was a wonderful pitcher and he is a good one yet.&quot; He played for the outlaw league&#x27;s St. Louis Terriers and won 21 games, the eighth and final time he reached the 20-win plateau. Some baseball reference works decline to acknowledge the Federal League as a major league, and therefore give Plank credit for only seven 20-win seasons and 305 total wins.

When the Federal League folded, Plank applied for free agency but was declared to belong to the St. Louis Browns for 1916. In September of that year, Plank predicted that he might be able to pitch ten more seasons, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t know whether it is that I have more on the ball this season than I had in other years, but at any rate I feel that I have just as much stuff as I ever did.&quot; However, by June 1917 newspapers reported that Plank&#x27;s career was nearly over; he had struggled with arm problems and had left the team at one point due to a nervous breakdown. He retired in October 1917, citing stomach difficulties brought on by the stress of baseball. His final game was a 1–0 11-inning complete game loss to Walter Johnson and the Washington Senators on August 6, 1917. Despite his announcement, the New York Yankees traded pitchers Urban Shocker and Nick Cullop, infielders Fritz Maisel and Joe Gedeon, catcher Les Nunamaker, and cash to the Browns for Plank and Del Pratt. Plank refused to report to New York, insisting he was retired.

Over his career, Plank amassed a 326–194 record, a 2.35 ERA, and 2,246 strikeouts. He won 305 games in the American League (AL), making him that league&#x27;s winningest left-handed pitcher. He was the winningest left-hander in baseball history until 1962, when Warren Spahn won his 327th game. In addition, he was the winningest pitcher (left or right-handed) in the AL until 1921, when he was surpassed by Walter Johnson.

Plank was known as a finesse pitcher with a good sidearm sweeping curveball. His best-known pitch was nicknamed the &quot;cross-fire.&quot; Thrown across his body, it reached home plate at an angle, making it difficult for hitters to track, especially if they were left-handed. Plank was active on the mound before he threw a pitch, even sometimes talking to the baseball before he delivered it. This strange behavior helped to unnerve opposing hitters. His consistent performance and strong work ethic led Mack to use him frequently, part of the reason Plank at times developed sore arms during his career. Plank was also known for his long pauses on the mound, which some claimed lengthened the duration of the games in which he pitched.

Plank was also a good hitting pitcher in his career, compiling a .206 batting average (331-for-1607) with 130 runs scored, 3 home runs, and 122 RBI. He recorded a career .971 fielding percentage, which was 28 points over the league average for AL pitchers from 1901 to 1917.

==Personal life==
Plank married Anna (&quot;née&quot; Myers) in 1915. They had a son, named Edward Stewart Plank Jr. According to baseball historian Frank Russo, he was &quot;as solid a family man as you could ever find.&quot; Plank&#x27;s brother Ira was the baseball coach at Gettysburg College for more than 20 years. Friendly by nature, Plank did the unusual by taking time to mentor the rookie pitchers on the Athletics&#x27; staff, and he befriended Louis Van Zelst, a hunchback who served as the team&#x27;s mascot.

==Later life==
After retirement, Plank opened a Buick dealership in Gettysburg. He pitched the 1918 season for the Steelton club of the Bethlehem Steel League, an industrial baseball league. Steelton was only from his home and the arrangement allowed him to manage his business during the week.

Plank did not seem to be in ill health after his career, but on February 22, 1926, his wife awoke to discover her husband paralyzed on the left side due to a stroke and suffering garbled speech. Upon arriving at the Plank home, the family physician and Plank&#x27;s wife decided he should be left where he was for treatment, rather than moved to a hospital. The pitcher showed signs of recovery briefly, then started having bouts of lost consciousness. He lost the ability to speak, and by the 24th, no one expected him to recover. He died at 2:49 P.M. that day.

Two days after his death, Plank&#x27;s funeral was held at Gettysburg&#x27;s First Presbyterian Church. The Rev. W. C. Space said, &quot;Eddie...was true to his manhood, true to his parents, true to his wife and home, true to his God and church. What better could be spoken of any man?&quot; He was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Gettysburg. Anna lived 29 more years before her death in 1955.

Upon hearing of Plank&#x27;s death, Connie Mack said that he felt like a father who had just lost a son. &quot;Eddie Plank was one of the smartest left-hand pitchers it has been my pleasure to have on my club. He was short and light, as pitchers go, but he made up for the physical defects, if such they were, by his study of the game and his smartness when he was on the pitching peak&quot;, he said. Former teammate Jack Coombs said, &quot;I have always been thankful that I was thrown into such intimate contact with so inspiring a man in the days when the majority of ballplayers were of a much lower type than at the present time.&quot;

Plank was a Freemason and a member of Good Samaritan Lodge No. 336 in Gettysburg.

==Legacy==

In 1943, former teammate Eddie Collins remembered Plank as the greatest pitcher in baseball. &quot;Not the fastest. Not the trickiest, and not the possessor of the most stuff, but just the greatest&quot;, Collins said. Babe Ruth thought he was the hardest pitcher to hit, and Ty Cobb selected him to his all-time team. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946 and voted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in 1972.

Gettysburg College began planning for the Eddie Plank Memorial Gymnasium at the college shortly after Plank&#x27;s death. The gym was completed in 1927 and indoor sports such as basketball and wrestling were played there until 1962. A restaurant in downtown Gettysburg honors Plank&#x27;s career. A portion of Plank&#x27;s childhood farm is a housing development known as Plank&#x27;s Field. Plank is mentioned in the 1949 poem &quot;Line-Up for Yesterday&quot; by Ogden Nash.

In 2006, a T206 tobacco card featuring Plank was described as the &quot;second most valuable card in existence.&quot; It was owned by Arizona Diamondbacks owner Ken Kendrick and was part of a collection that Kendrick loaned to the Baseball Hall of Fame for display there. The most valuable baseball card in existence, a T206 Honus Wagner card, is in the same collection.

The first full-length biography of Eddie Plank, &quot;Gettysburg Eddie: The Story of Eddie Plank&quot; by Lawrence Knorr, was published in 2018 by Sunbury Press.

<doc id="420546" wikidata="Q7247920" url="?curid=420546" title="Professional American football championship games">
<text>Below is a list of professional football Championship Games in the United States, involving:
* the informal western Pennsylvania professional football circuit (WPC, 1890 to c.1910);
* the 1902 &quot;National&quot; Football League and the World Series of Professional Football (WSF, 1902–1903);
* the Ohio Independent Championship (OIC, 1903–1919);
* the New York Pro Football League (NYPFL, 1916–1919);
* the American Professional Football Association and the National Football League (NFL, 1920–present);
* the All-America Football Conference (AAFC, 1946–1949);
* the American Football League (AFL, 1960–1969);
* the World Football League (WFL, 1974–1975); 
* the United States Football League (USFL, 1983–85); 
* the XFL (2001);
* the United Football League (2009–2011);
* and any inter-league challenge games that included at least one champion of a major, or borderline-major, league.

Prior to 1920, no national professional football league existed, and play was scattered across semi-pro and professional leagues in the upper midwest. The first efforts at pro football championships were the World Series of Professional Football, featuring teams from and around New York City and the 1902 &quot;National&quot; Football League in Pennsylvania; two of the three &quot;N&quot;FL teams participated as one team in the World Series of Pro Football. 

The Ohio League and New York Pro Football League were two prominent regional associations in the 1910s (the NYPFL held an actual championship game in 1919).

In 1920, teams from the Ohio League and New York Pro Football League, along with other midwestern teams, formalized into the American Professional Football Association (APFA), and the league was later renamed the National Football League (NFL). 

The NFL conducted play for thirteen years before creating a &quot;Championship Game&quot;: from 1920 through 1932, league &quot;champions&quot; were determined by won-loss record with ties excluded, but the schedules and rules were so ill-defined that conflicts exist to this day over who the actual champions were: some teams played more games than others, while some played against college or semi-pro teams, some played &quot;after&quot; the season was over, and some stopped play &quot;before&quot; a season was over. For example, in 1921, the Buffalo All-Americans disputed the Chicago Staleys&#x27; title, and in 1925, the Pottsville Maroons claimed the championship was theirs, not the Chicago Cardinals&#x27;. The APFA also had no official Championship Games before it changed its name to the NFL in 1922. 

Boston/Washington Redskins owner George Preston Marshall, who credited with significant innovations by the NFL, convinced the NFL in 1933 to play a Championship Game between the two Division winners following the success of the 1932 Playoff Game. 

Thus, 1933 was the year of the first national professional football Championship Game in the United States. See National Football League championships: note that game scores marked with a † (1921 and 1932) were &quot;de facto&quot; Championship Games, as these were the deciding games in determining a Championship, and also the last game played in that season - further, the Portsmouth Spartans, who were defeated in the 1932 Game, finished third as the Game counted in the season standings.

All games are listed under the year in which the majority of regular season games were played: especially since the 1960s, many championship games have been played in the January or, since 2002, February of the following year (i.e. the Championship Game of the 2011 NFL season was played in February 2012, but is listed here under 2011).

<text>John Meade Falkner (8 May 1858 – 22 July 1932) was an English novelist and poet, best known for his 1898 novel &quot;Moonfleet&quot;. An extremely successful businessman, he became chairman of the arms manufacturer Armstrong Whitworth during World War I.

==Life and works==
Falkner was born in Manningford Bruce, Wiltshire, and spent much of his childhood in Dorchester and Weymouth. He was educated at Marlborough College and Hertford College, Oxford, graduating with a third-class degree in history in 1882. After Oxford, he was a master at Derby School, then went to Newcastle as tutor to the family of Sir Andrew Noble, who ran Armstrong Whitworth Co., one of the largest arms manufacturers in the world. Falkner eventually followed him as chairman in 1915. In his business travels round the world, Falkner brought back antiquarian treasures of all kinds.

After his retirement as chairman in 1921 he became Honorary Reader in paleography at the University of Durham, as well as Honorary Librarian to the Dean and Chapter Library of Durham Cathedral. Falkner fell in love with Durham and, although he spent his later years travelling frequently, he called Durham his home, living in the Divinity House (now the University Music School) on Palace Green in front of the cathedral from 1902 until his death. There is a commemorative plaque there, while his monument is in the south cloister of the cathedral. He is buried at St John the Baptist Church in Burford, Oxfordshire.

In addition to his three novels and his poetry, he also wrote three topographical guides (Oxfordshire, Bath and Berkshire) and a &quot;History of Oxfordshire&quot;.

<text>Lawrence Neil Bonnett (July 30, 1946 – February 11, 1994) was an American NASCAR driver who compiled 18 victories and 20 poles over his 18-year career. Bonnett was a member of the Alabama Gang, and started his career with the help of Bobby and Donnie Allison. He rose to prominence in the late 1970s with his performances in cars owned by Jim Stacy and Wood Brothers Racing, becoming one of the top competitors in the 1980s. The Alabama native currently ranks 47th in all-time NASCAR Cup victories. He appeared in the 1983 film &quot;Stroker Ace&quot; and the 1990 film &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;. Bonnett hosted the TV show &quot;Winners&quot; for TNN from 1991 to 1994. He was a color commentator for CBS, TBS, and TNN in the years until his death. Bonnett&#x27;s driving career was interrupted by a severe brain injury from a crash in 1990. He was killed while practicing for the 1994 Daytona 500 for a much-anticipated comeback.

==NASCAR career==
Bonnett was born in the Birmingham suburb of Hueytown, Alabama on July 30, 1946. Bonnett began his NASCAR career as a protégé of 1983 Winston Cup champion Bobby Allison, working on the team&#x27;s cars. He later became part of the famous &quot;Alabama Gang&quot; that included himself, Red Farmer and the Allison family: father Bobby, brother Donnie and, later, son Davey. He began driving in NASCAR in 1974 and earned his first victory in 1977 at the Capital City 400 in Richmond, Virginia driving for Harry Hyde-Jim Stacy Racing, which had bought out the K&amp;K Insurance team that he had previously driven for. He had another victory in 1977 at the Los Angeles Times 500, which would be the last Dodge win in NASCAR until 2001. Many in racing circles thought 1978 would be his year to dominate, but troubles with his cars (the new for &#x27;78 Dodge Magnum) and financial problems between Hyde and Stacy caused his cars to fail and to drop out of many races. In addition, Bonnett had grown tired of Stacy&#x27;s dictatorial management style and tendency to miss payments, which led to Hyde suing Stacy for unpaid bills. In 1979 he signed with Wood Brothers Racing to replaced David Pearson and revived his career with three victories. He later won back-to-back World 600s (NASCAR&#x27;s longest race, now the Coca-Cola 600) in 1982 and 1983 and back-to-back Busch Clash victories in 1983 and &#x27;84, including his first in which he did not win a single pole from the previous season, but was selected as a wild card entry.

In 1984, Bonnett joined Junior Johnson&#x27;s team, becoming a teammate to Darrell Waltrip. In 1985, he had one of his best seasons, finishing fourth in the points standings while Waltrip went on to win his third championship.

Bonnett participated in International Race of Champions (IROC) during three seasons (1979, 1980, and 1984), and finished second twice.

Bonnett holds the distinction of being the winner of the first ever NASCAR race held outside of North America when he won the 1988 Goodyear NASCAR 500 at the Calder Park Thunderdome in Melbourne, Australia (at the time the newly opened Thunderdome was also the first NASCAR style speedway to be built outside of North America). The race, run two weeks after the Daytona 500, was not a Winston Cup race but featured some drivers from the series including fellow Alabama Gang member Bobby Allison, Michael Waltrip, Dave Marcis and Kyle Petty who were up against Australian drivers somewhat new to NASCAR racing. Bonnett, who had won the Pontiac Excitement 400 at Richmond International Raceway the previous weekend, started from the pole driving his Valvoline sponsored Pontiac Grand Prix. He and Allison (who had won the Daytona 500 two weeks previous), driving a Buick LeSabre, dominated the crash marred, 280 lap 500 km (310 mile) race finishing first and second ahead of Dave Marcis on a day when cabin temperatures were reported to reach over 57 °C (135 °F) as the race was held during Australia&#x27;s notoriously hot summer.

On April 1, 1990, Bonnett suffered a life-threatening crash during the TranSouth 500 at Darlington, South Carolina, when his car slammed into Sterling Marlin&#x27;s car during a 14-car crash on lap 212. He was left with amnesia and dizziness and retired from racing and turned to television, becoming a race color commentator for TNN, CBS Sports, and TBS Sports, and hosting the TV show &quot;Winners&quot; for TNN.

However, Bonnett still desired to continue racing. In 1992, he began testing cars for good friends Dale Earnhardt and car owner Richard Childress. Cleared to race again in 1993 and upon Earnhardt&#x27;s suggestion, Childress gave Bonnett a ride for the 1993 DieHard 500 at Talladega Superspeedway which was numbered 31 and sponsored by GM Goodwrench. But his comeback race was marred by a crash in which his car spun, became airborne, and crashed into the spectator fence. He was uninjured and called the rest of the race from the CBS broadcast booth after being cleared at the infield care center. He would also start the final race of the 1993 season in Atlanta, but he dropped out after just three laps. The reason the team gave for removing the car from the race was a blown engine; however, he was teamed with points leader Earnhardt, and the car was retired to assist Earnhardt in winning the season&#x27;s championship. Earnhardt needed to maximize his finishing position, and by Bonnett quitting the race he was assured of those three championship points. This would become Bonnett&#x27;s final NASCAR Winston Cup Series start.

==Death==
Despite the setbacks, Bonnett was encouraged because he had secured a ride and sponsorship for at least five races in the 1994 season with car owner James Finch, including the season-opening race, the Daytona 500, for Phoenix Racing. But on February 11, 1994, during the first practice session for the 1994 Daytona 500, a shock mount broke, causing him to lose control of his Chevrolet on the track&#x27;s high-banked fourth turn. The car swerved onto the track apron, and then up the steep bank, before crashing into the wall nearly head-on. Bonnett did not survive the accident; he was 47 years old.

That weekend, another racing death occurred, as 1993 Goody&#x27;s Dash (four-cylinder) champion Rodney Orr was also killed in a racing crash during the practices surrounding the first weekend. In the middle of the second Goodyear-Hoosier tire war, Hoosier withdrew from the race immediately. Five years later, the broken shock mounts became an issue again in NASCAR, as cars bottoming out were evident during the first night race at Daytona in 1998. By 2000, NASCAR imposed a new rule where the sanctioning body built the shocks and had mandatory specification springs for the cars to prevent this tactic, to stop the dangerous tactics being used to reduce drag that led to the fatal crashes.

Bonnett is buried in Pleasant Grove&#x27;s cemetery, Forest Grove Memorial Gardens. A road called &quot;Allison-Bonnett Memorial Drive&quot; in his hometown honors him, along with fellow native Davey Allison, who died seven months earlier.

When Earnhardt, Bonnett&#x27;s colleague, won the 1998 Daytona 500, he dedicated the victory to Bonnett among others.

Earnhardt himself died in a racing accident during the final lap of the 2001 Daytona 500. About three weeks after the accident, magazine photographers released photographs of Bonnett&#x27;s autopsy, as well as those of another driver who died a few days later, Rodney Orr, to the public, which led to a lawsuit.

When Brad Keselowski scored Phoenix Racing&#x27;s first Sprint Cup win 15 years later in the 2009 Aaron&#x27;s 499 at Talladega Superspeedway, Finch dedicated the win to Bonnett. During the 2013 season, Finch designed the No. 51 car&#x27;s paint scheme in the Cup and Nationwide Series like Bonnett&#x27;s 1994 Country Time Chevrolet that he drove shortly before his death.

==In popular culture==
Bonnett was portrayed by the actor Sean Bridgers in the TV movie &quot;3: The Dale Earnhardt Story&quot;.

<text>The Agence de coopération culturelle et technique (ACCT, French for &quot;Agency of cultural and technical cooperation&quot;) was founded on 20 March, 1970 by the representatives of the 21 states and governments under the influence of African Heads of State, Léopold Sédar Senghor of Senegal, Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia, Hamani Diori of Niger and Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia.

It was the precursor to what is now the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. Canadian Jean-Louis Roy was the first, and only, secretary-general of the organization from 1989 until 1997.

<text>Combinatorial optimization is a subfield of mathematical optimization that consists of finding an optimal object from a finite set of objects, where the set of feasible solutions is discrete or can be reduced to a discrete set. Typical combinatorial optimization problems are the travelling salesman problem (&quot;TSP&quot;), the minimum spanning tree problem (&quot;MST&quot;), and the knapsack problem. In many such problems, such as the ones previously mentioned, exhaustive search is not tractable, and so specialized algorithms that quickly rule out large parts of the search space or approximation algorithms must be resorted to instead.

Combinatorial optimization is related to operations research, algorithm theory, and computational complexity theory. It has important applications in several fields, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, auction theory, software engineering, VLSI, applied mathematics and theoretical computer science.

==Applications==
Basic applications of combinatorial optimization include, but are not limited to:

* Logistics
* Supply chain optimization
* Developing the best airline network of spokes and destinations
* Deciding which taxis in a fleet to route to pick up fares
* Determining the optimal way to deliver packages
* Allocating jobs to people optimally
* Designing water distribution networks
* Earth science problems (e.g. reservoir flow-rates)

==Methods==
There is a large amount of literature on polynomial-time algorithms for certain special classes of discrete optimization. A considerable amount of it is unified by the theory of linear programming. Some examples of combinatorial optimization problems that are covered by this framework are shortest paths and shortest-path trees, flows and circulations, spanning trees, matching, and matroid problems.

For NP-complete discrete optimization problems, current research literature includes the following topics:
* polynomial-time exactly solvable special cases of the problem at hand (e.g. fixed-parameter tractable problems)
* algorithms that perform well on &quot;random&quot; instances (e.g. for the traveling salesman problem)
* approximation algorithms that run in polynomial time and find a solution that is close to optimal
* parameterized approximation algorithms that run in FPT time and find a solution close to the optimum
* solving real-world instances that arise in practice and do not necessarily exhibit the worst-case behavior of in NP-complete problems (e.g. real-world TSP instances with tens of thousands of nodes).

Combinatorial optimization problems can be viewed as searching for the best element of some set of discrete items; therefore, in principle, any sort of search algorithm or metaheuristic can be used to solve them. Widely applicable approaches include branch-and-bound (an exact algorithm which can be stopped at any point in time to serve as heuristic), branch-and-cut (uses linear optimisation to generate bounds), dynamic programming (a recursive solution construction with limited search window) and tabu search (a greedy-type swapping algorithm). However, generic search algorithms are not guaranteed to find an optimal solution first, nor are they guaranteed to run quickly (in polynomial time). Since some discrete optimization problems are NP-complete, such as the traveling salesman (decision) problem, this is expected unless P=NP.

For each combinatorial optimization problem, there is a corresponding decision problem that asks whether there is a feasible solution for some particular measure formula_1. For example, if there is a graph formula_2 which contains vertices formula_3 and formula_4, an optimization problem might be &quot;find a path from formula_3 to formula_4 that uses the fewest edges&quot;. This problem might have an answer of, say, 4. A corresponding decision problem would be &quot;is there a path from formula_3 to formula_4 that uses 10 or fewer edges?&quot; This problem can be answered with a simple &#x27;yes&#x27; or &#x27;no&#x27;.

The field of approximation algorithms deals with algorithms to find near-optimal solutions to hard problems. The usual decision version is then an inadequate definition of the problem since it only specifies acceptable solutions. Even though we could introduce suitable decision problems, the problem is then more naturally characterized as an optimization problem.

== NP optimization problem ==

An &quot;NP-optimization problem&quot; (NPO) is a combinatorial optimization problem with the following additional conditions. Note that the below referred polynomials are functions of the size of the respective functions&#x27; inputs, not the size of some implicit set of input instances.

* the size of every feasible solution formula_9 is polynomially bounded in the size of the given instance formula_10,
* the languages formula_11 and formula_12 can be recognized in polynomial time, and
* formula_13 is polynomial-time computable.

This implies that the corresponding decision problem is in NP. In computer science, interesting optimization problems usually have the above properties and are therefore NPO problems. A problem is additionally called a P-optimization (PO) problem, if there exists an algorithm which finds optimal solutions in polynomial time. Often, when dealing with the class NPO, one is interested in optimization problems for which the decision versions are NP-complete. Note that hardness relations are always with respect to some reduction. Due to the connection between approximation algorithms and computational optimization problems, reductions which preserve approximation in some respect are for this subject preferred than the usual Turing and Karp reductions. An example of such a reduction would be L-reduction. For this reason, optimization problems with NP-complete decision versions are not necessarily called NPO-complete.

NPO is divided into the following subclasses according to their approximability:

* &quot;NPO(I)&quot;: Equals FPTAS. Contains the Knapsack problem.
* &quot;NPO(II)&quot;: Equals PTAS. Contains the Makespan scheduling problem.
* &quot;NPO(III)&quot;: The class of NPO problems that have polynomial-time algorithms which computes solutions with a cost at most &quot;c&quot; times the optimal cost (for minimization problems) or a cost at least formula_14 of the optimal cost (for maximization problems). In Hromkovič&#x27;s book, excluded from this class are all NPO(II)-problems save if P=NP. Without the exclusion, equals APX. Contains MAX-SAT and metric TSP.
* &quot;NPO(IV)&quot;: The class of NPO problems with polynomial-time algorithms approximating the optimal solution by a ratio that is polynomial in a logarithm of the size of the input. In Hromkovič&#x27;s book, all NPO(III)-problems are excluded from this class unless P=NP. Contains the set cover problem.
* &quot;NPO(V)&quot;: The class of NPO problems with polynomial-time algorithms approximating the optimal solution by a ratio bounded by some function on n. In Hromkovic&#x27;s book, all NPO(IV)-problems are excluded from this class unless P=NP. Contains the TSP and clique problem.

An NPO problem is called &quot;polynomially bounded&quot; (PB) if, for every instance formula_10 and for every solution formula_9, the measure formula_17 is bounded by a polynomial function of the size of formula_10. The class NPOPB is the class of NPO problems that are polynomially-bounded.

<doc id="420560" wikidata="Q1282610" url="?curid=420560" title="Edd Roush">
<text>Edd J. Roush (May 8, 1893 – March 21, 1988) was an American professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball as a center fielder from 1913 to 1931, most prominently as a member of the Cincinnati Reds where he was a two-time National League (NL) batting champion and led the team to the 1919 World Series championship. He also played for the New York Giants, Chicago White Sox as well as the Newark Peppers and the Indianapolis Hoosiers of the Federal League. Roush accumulated a .323 batting average over his 18-year playing career and was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962.

==Early life==
Roush was born in Oakland City, Indiana, on May 8, 1893, to parents Laura and William Roush, a dairy farmer. A twin, he and his brother Fred (not short for Edward or Frederick, respectively) each shared a middle initial of J, which was not short for any name. The boys worked on the dairy farm throughout childhood. Edd was left-handed, but he learned to throw and bat right-handed early in his career due to the fact that left-handed gloves were scarce in Oakland City.

He received the opportunity to play for the local semi-pro Oakland City Walkovers in 1909 after their regular outfielders failed to appear. After collecting two hits the first game he became a starting outfielder. In 1911, once he learned that other players were receiving $5 () per game, he transferred to the rival Princeton, Indiana team. In 1912 , he played for the Evansville, Indiana team in the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League (KITTY). He performed well with the team and hit .284 in 1912 and .300 in 1913 when his contract was bought by the Chicago White Sox.

==Professional baseball career==
===Early career===
Roush made his major league debut as a 20-year-old for the Chicago White Sox on August 20, 1913. After nine games he was sent to the minors to play for Lincoln Railsplitters of the Western League. After only ten games he quit and returned to Oakland City.

Roush joined the Indianapolis Hoosiers of the Federal League in 1914 and hit .325 through 74 games as the Hoosiers won the pennant. The Hoosiers became the Newark Peppers in and Roush continued to play outfield for the team under manager, and fellow 1962 Hall of Fame inductee Bill McKechnie. After the Federal League disbanded in early 1916, the Giants picked up Roush, McKechnie and Bill Rariden. Midway through the 1916 season, the Giants traded Roush, McKechnie, and Hall of Famer Christy Mathewson to the Cincinnati Reds.

===Cincinnati Reds===

Roush played only 69 games with the Reds in 1916 and finished second in team batting average with .287, behind Hal Chase. 1917 was Roush&#x27;s first full season with the Reds and by the end of August his batting average of .347 topped Rogers Hornsby who was in second place. An injured leg caused him to miss the final week of the season but Hornsby could not catch his .341 average. At season&#x27;s end, Roush led the National League in batting average and finished third in hits with 178, only 4 behind leader Heinie Groh.

In 1918, Roush finished the season with a .333 average, .002 behind Hall of Famer Zack Wheat. On April 29, 1918, the Reds originally beat the St. Louis Cardinals, but a protested play caused the game to be replayed on August 11. The play in question involved Roush, who slid to make a catch in the outfield. After he juggled the ball, he secured it in his glove to make the out and threw to third base as the runner left before the catch was made. The Cardinals protested the play stating that the runner did not have to wait until the ball was settled into Roush&#x27;s glove to begin running. They presented this to National League President John Heydler and won. The game was then replayed on August 11. This is significant because Roush went 2–3 in the initial game, and 1–4 in the replayed game. If the initial game stood then Roush would have finished the season 146 for 434 (a .336 batting average) instead of 145 for 435 (a .333 batting average). This would have made him batting champion for the second straight year.

Roush won his second batting title in 1919, when he led the league with a batting average of .321, and led the Cincinnati Reds to the World Series. The Reds won the 1919 World Series, known for the Black Sox Scandal, by winning five of the eight games. Throughout his life Roush would state that the Reds were the better team, and would have won the Series either way. Roush showed up for spring training in 1920, an occurrence rare enough that The Sporting News reported on it. Roush would hunt quail and rabbits at his home in Oakland City, Indiana right until a week before opening day. On June 8, 1920, a lengthy argument took place on the field, and Roush fell asleep in the outfield. After infielder Heinie Groh was unsuccessful at waking Roush up, Roush was ejected for delay of game. Roush hit .339, and set career highs in hits, doubles, triples, RBI, and total bases.

1921 would be the first of many holdouts that Roush would start. After his stellar 1920 season where he led the team in hits, triples, RBI, stolen bases and average, he argued that his salary of $15,000 () was not enough. He failed to show up to spring training and continued to hold out until April 30 when he reached an agreement with the Reds. The Reds played poorly in 1921, and by the end of May they were 14–28. Roush had been sidelined a couple of times during the season with leg injuries, but he finished the year batting .385 over the last 37 games of the season to finish with a career-high .352 batting average, second to Rogers Hornsby.

Before the 1922 season would start, Roush entered negotiations with the Reds for the second straight year, this time demanding a 3-year contract for $18,000 () per year. After the initial demand, Roush held out for months prompting &quot;The Sporting News&quot; to say:

He is the best silence keeper in baseball. Just says real early what he wants and then closes up. No gabbing or elaborate explanations. Transacts business the way he plays ball– no fuss, but exceedingly effective.

On July 26 Roush met with team president Gary Herrmann to negotiate a ten-week contract that would expire at the end of the season. After the contract was signed he put on a uniform and joined the in progress game against the Philadelphia Phillies. Over the 49 games he played in 1922 he hit for a .352 average. 1923 would start similarly to the previous two years with a new holdout by Roush; this time he demanded a $25,000 () salary. The Reds countered with the salary he was making the previous season and began to fine him $50 per day of missed training camp. On April 15 the two sides reached an agreement. He missed time due to a fractured rib from August 29 to September 14, although it is still disputed when he broke the rib. He finished the year with a .351 average and led the league in doubles with 41.

In the off season before Opening Day in 1924 Roush signed a three-year $19,000 contract. During spring training, manager Pat Moran fell ill on the train ride to their training facilities in Florida, and on March 7, 1924, he died. In April Roush strained his side when he swung and missed at a pitch and was sidelined for eight games and would again be sidelined for nine games after he strained a muscle in his leg in St. Louis. Roush would finish the year with a .348 average and led the league with 21 triples. Roush became team captain of the Reds in 1925 and led the team to a third-place finish, a disappointing end to the season as the Reds led the league in ERA for the third year in a row.

On July 21, 1926, team officials celebrated &quot;Roush Day&quot; at Redland Field in honor Roush and his decade spent with the team. At the end of the season it was clear that with three younger outfielders, Curt Walker, Cuckoo Christensen and Rube Bressler, the Reds would part ways with the 34 year old Roush. In February 1927 Roush was traded to the Giants for George Kelly and an undetermined amount of cash. From 1917 to 1926 Roush hit .339 and collected over 1,600 hits. The Reds were trading the player with the highest career batting average for the team at that point. He had the most triples for the team for any player after 1900. From 1917 to 1926, he never had a batting average under .323.

===Later career===
Roush&#x27;s career with the Giants started with a contract dispute. The Giants offered $19,000 (), and Roush rejected the offer, demanding $30,000 (). Roush met with John McGraw, the Giants manager, in a hotel room in Chattanooga, Tennessee to work out the details of the contract. After a back-and-forth discussion about how Roush did not want to play in New York, the two sides agreed to a three-year $70,000 () contract.

In 1927 Roush had a down year for the third place Giants, and batted only .304, the lowest average since 1916. The following year he suffered torn muscles in his abdomen and only appeared in 46 games. After receiving surgery on the torn muscles in February, he returned to form and hit .324 over 115 games for the Giants.

In early 1930 Roush threatened to retire than to receive a pay cut. After the two sides could not agree on a number Roush held out for the whole season. When the Great Depression hit in late 1929, the Roush family was largely unaffected due to his frequent holdouts and salary demands. Roush spent the season with his family and played in benefit baseball games in Oakland City and Princeton. As the next season began, Roush refused to play for the Giants and retired from baseball. He was contacted by Reds President Sidney Weil to play for the team in 1931. After a short negotiation, both sides agreed to a one-year contract worth $15,000 (). Roush struggled in his last season in baseball, only managing to hit .271 in 101 games. In his final game he went 2–3 with a triple in a 5–3 loss against the pennant winning Cardinals.

Roush finished his 18-year career with a .323 lifetime average, 268 stolen bases and 182 triples. He never struck out more than 25 times in a season and had 30 inside-the-park home runs. Roush used a Louisville Slugger, the heaviest bat used in baseball.

At the time of his retirement in 1931, he was second place behind Bid McPhee for hits and triples in Cincinnati Reds history. Hall of Fame pitcher Pete Alexander wrote of Roush, &quot;Of all the batters I have faced ... Edd Roush and Ross Youngs are the trickiest. I won&#x27;t say they are the hardest hitters but they are the trickiest, smartest.&quot;

==Later life and honors==
Roush served one season as the Reds coach alongside his good friend, manager Bill McKechnie, who had previously been his teammate. During his career he had saved his money and was able to retire after he finished playing. He built a house in Bradenton, Florida, and used it as a winter residence. He frequently attended spring training and told stories of the old days. Roush spent most of his time in his hometown of Oakland City, where he served on the town and school boards and ran the Montgomery cemetery for 35 years.

He was one of the 22 players interviewed by Lawrence Ritter and included in the original version of &quot;The Glory of Their Times&quot;, a ground-breaking book that set a standard for oral histories of baseball.

Roush was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962 via the Veterans Committee. In addition to Roush&#x27;s selection into the Baseball Hall of Fame, chosen with McKechnie, he is also a member of the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame, inducted in 1960.

Considered the greatest player in Reds&#x27; history at the time, Roush was invited to throw out the first ball at the last game at Crosley Field on June 24, 1970. Joe Morgan called Roush &quot;the best of us all&quot;.

In 1981, Ritter and Donald Honig included Roush in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;.

Roush died at the age of 94 on March 21, 1988, in Bradenton, Florida. At the time of his death he was the last surviving Federal League participant and the last surviving 1919 World Series participant.

<doc id="420561" wikidata="Q746413" url="?curid=420561" title="Elsevier">
<text>Elsevier () is a Dutch academic publishing company specializing in scientific, technical, and medical content. Its products include journals such as &quot;The Lancet&quot;, &quot;Cell&quot;, the ScienceDirect collection of electronic journals, &quot;Trends&quot;, the &quot;Current Opinion&quot; series, the online citation database Scopus, the SciVal tool for measuring research performance, the ClinicalKey search engine for clinicians, and the ClinicalPath evidence-based cancer care service. Elsevier&#x27;s products and services include digital tools for data management, instruction, research analytics, and assessment. Elsevier is part of the RELX Group, known until 2015 as Reed Elsevier, a publicly traded company. According to RELX reports, in 2022 Elsevier published more than 600,000 articles annually in over 2,800 journals; as of 2018 its archives contained over 17 million documents and 40,000 e-books, with over one billion annual downloads.

Researchers have criticized Elsevier for its high profit margins and copyright practices. The company had a reported profit before tax of £2.295 billion with an adjusted operating margin of 33.1% in 2023. Much of the research that Elsevier publishes is publicly funded; its high costs have led to accusations of rent-seeking, boycotts against them, and the rise of alternate avenues for publication and access, such as preprint servers and shadow libraries.

== History ==

Elsevier was founded in 1880 and adopted the name and logo from the Dutch publishing house Elzevir that was an inspiration but has no connection to the contemporary Elsevier. The Elzevir family operated as booksellers and publishers in the Netherlands; the founder, Lodewijk Elzevir (1542–1617), lived in Leiden and established that business in 1580. As a company logo, Elsevier used the Elzevir family&#x27;s printer&#x27;s mark, a tree entwined with a vine and the words &quot;Non Solus&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;not alone&quot;. According to Elsevier, this logo represents &quot;the symbiotic relationship between publisher and scholar&quot;.

The expansion of Elsevier in the scientific field after 1945 was funded with the profits of the newsweekly &quot;Elsevier&quot;, which published its first issue on 27 October 1945. The weekly was an instant success and very profitable. The weekly was a continuation, as is stated in its first issue, of the monthly &quot;Elsevier&quot;, which was founded in 1891 to promote the name of the publishing house and had to stop publication in December 1940 because of the German occupation of the Netherlands.

In May 1939 Klautz established the Elsevier Publishing Company Ltd. in London to distribute these academic titles in the British Commonwealth (except Canada). When the Nazis occupied the Netherlands for the duration of five years from May 1940, he had just founded a second international office, the Elsevier Publishing Company Inc. in New York.

In 1947, Elsevier began publishing its first English-language journal, &quot;Biochimica et Biophysica Acta&quot;.

In 1970, Elsevier acquired competing firm North-
Holland. In 1971 the firm acquired Excerpta Medica,a small medical abstract publisher based in Amsterdam. As the first and only company in the world that employed a database for the production of journals, it introduced computer technology to Elsevier. In 1978 Elsevier merged with Dutch newspaper publisher NDU, and devised a strategy to broadcast textual news to people&#x27;s television sets through Viewdata and Teletext technology.

In 1979 Elsevier Science Publishers launched the Article Delivery Over Network Information System (ADONIS) project in conjunction with four business partners. The project aims to find a way to deliver scientific articles to libraries electronically, and would continue for over a decade. In 1991, in conjunction with nine American universities, Elsevier&#x27;s The University Licensing Project (TULIP) was the first step in creating published, copyrighted material available over the Internet. It formed the basis for ScienceDirect, launched six years later. In 1997, after almost two decades of experiments, ScienceDirect was launched as the first online repository of electronic (scientific) books and articles. Though librarians and researchers were initially hesitant regarding the new technology, more and more of them switched to e-only subscriptions.

In 2004 Elsevier launched Scopus - a multidisciplinary metadata database of scholarly publications, only the second of such kind (after the Web of Science, although free Google Scholar was also launched in 2004). Scopus covers journals, some conference papers and books from various publishers, and measures performance on both author and publication levels. In 2009 SciVal Spotlight was released. This tool enabled research administrators to measure their institution&#x27;s relative standing in terms of productivity, grants, and publications .

In 2013, Elsevier acquired Mendeley, a UK company making software for managing and sharing research papers. Mendeley, previously an open platform for sharing of research, was greatly criticized for the sale, which users saw as acceding to the &quot;paywall&quot; approach to research literature. Mendeley&#x27;s previously open-sharing system now allows exchange of paywalled resources only within private groups. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described Elsevier&#x27;s reasons for buying Mendeley as two-fold: to acquire its user data, and to &quot;destroy or coöpt an open-science icon that threatens its business model&quot;.

== Company statistics ==
, researchers submitted over 1.8 million research papers to Elsevier-based publications. Over 20,000 editors managed the peer review and selection of these papers, resulting in the publication of more than 470,000 articles in over 2,500 journals. Editors are generally unpaid volunteers who perform their duties alongside a full-time job in academic institutions, although exceptions have been reported. In 2013, the five editorial groups Elsevier, Springer, Wiley-Blackwell, Taylor &amp; Francis, and SAGE Publications published more than half of all academic papers in the peer-reviewed literature. At that time, Elsevier accounted for 16% of the world market in science, technology, and medical publishing. In 2019, Elsevier accounted for the review, editing and dissemination of 18% of the world&#x27;s scientific articles. About 45% of revenue by geography in 2019 derived from North America, 24% from Europe, and the remaining 31% from the rest of the world. Around 84% of revenue by format came from electronic usage and 16% came from print.

The firm employs 8,100 people. The CEO is Kumsal Bayazit, who was appointed on 15 February 2019. In 2018, it reported a mean 2017 gender pay gap of 29.1% for its UK workforce, while the median was 40.4%, the highest yet reported by a publisher in UK. Elsevier attributed the result to the under-representation of women in its senior ranks and the prevalence of men in its technical workforce. The UK workforce consists of 1,200 people in the UK, and represents 16% of Elsevier&#x27;s global employee population. Elsevier&#x27;s parent company, RELX, has a global workforce that is 51% female to 49% male, with 43% female and 57% male managers, and 29% female and 71% male senior operational managers.

In 2018, Elsevier accounted for 34% of the revenues of RELX group (£2.538 billion of £7.492 billion). In operating profits, it represented 40% (£942 million of £2,346 million). Adjusted operating profits (with constant currency) rose by 2% from 2017 to 2018. Profits grew further from 2018 to 2019, to a total of £982 million. the first half of 2019, RELX reported the first slowdown in revenue growth for Elsevier in several years: 1% vs. an expectation of 2% and a typical growth of at least 4% in the previous 5 years. Overall for 2019, Elsevier reported revenue growth of 3.9% from 2018, with the underlying growth at constant currency at 2%. In 2019, Elsevier accounted for 34% of the revenues of RELX (£2.637billion of £7.874billion). In adjusted operating profits, it represented 39% (£982m of £2.491bn). Adjusted operating profits (with constant currency) rose by 2% from 2018 to 2019.

In 2019, researchers submitted over two million research papers to Elsevier-based publications. Over 22,000 editors managed the peer review and selection of these papers, resulting in the publication of about 500,000 articles in over 2,500 journals.

In 2020 Elsevier was the largest academic publisher, with approximately 16% of the academic publishing market and more than 3000 journals.

== Market model ==

=== Products and services ===
Products and services include electronic and print versions of journals, textbooks and reference works, and cover the health, life, physical, and social sciences.

The target markets are academic and government research institutions, corporate research labs, booksellers, librarians, scientific researchers, authors, editors, physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, medical and nursing students and schools, medical researchers, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and research establishments. It publishes in 13 languages including English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Japanese, Hindi, and Chinese.

Flagship products and services include VirtualE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Scirus, EMBASE, Engineering Village, Compendex, Cell, Knovel, SciVal, Pure, and Analytical Services, The Consult series (FirstCONSULT, PathCONSULT, NursingCONSULT, MDConsult, StudentCONSULT), Virtual Clinical Excursions, and major reference works such as &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;Nelson Pediatrics&quot;, &quot;Dorland&#x27;s Illustrated Medical Dictionary&quot;, &quot;Netter&#x27;s Atlas of Human Anatomy&quot;, and online versions of many journals including &quot;The Lancet&quot;.

ScienceDirect is Elsevier&#x27;s platform for online electronic access to its journals and over 40,000 e-books, reference works, book series, and handbooks. The articles are grouped in four main sections: &quot;Physical Sciences and Engineering&quot;, &quot;Life Sciences&quot;, &quot;Health Sciences&quot;, and &quot;Social Sciences and Humanities&quot;. For most articles on the website, abstracts are freely available; access to the full text of the article (in PDF, and also HTML for newer publications) often requires a subscription or pay-per-view purchase.

In 2019, Elsevier published 49,000 free open access articles and 370 full open access journals. Moreover, 1,900 of its journals sold hybrid open access options.

=== Pricing ===
The subscription rates charged by the company for its journals have been criticized; some very large journals (with more than 5,000 articles) charge subscription prices as high as £9,634, far above average, and many British universities pay more than a million pounds to Elsevier annually. The company has been criticized not only by advocates of a switch to the open-access publication model, but also by universities whose library budgets make it difficult for them to afford current journal prices.

For example, in 2004, a resolution by Stanford University&#x27;s senate singled out Elsevier&#x27;s journals as being &quot;disproportionately expensive compared to their educational and research value&quot;, which librarians should consider dropping, and encouraged its faculty &quot;not to contribute articles or editorial or review efforts to publishers and journals that engage in exploitive or exorbitant pricing&quot;. Similar guidelines and criticism of Elsevier&#x27;s pricing policies have been passed by the University of California, Harvard University, and Duke University.

In July 2015, the Association of Universities in the Netherlands threatened to boycott Elsevier, which refused to negotiate on any open access policy for Dutch universities. After a year of negotiation, Elsevier pledged to make 30% of research published by Dutch researchers in Elsevier journals open access by 2018.

In October 2018, a complaint against Elsevier was filed with the European Commission, alleging anticompetitive practices stemming from Elsevier&#x27;s confidential subscription agreements and market dominance. The European Commission decided not to investigate.

The elevated pricing of field journals in economics, most of which are published by Elsevier, was one of the motivations that moved the American Economic Association to launch the &quot;American Economic Journal&quot; in 2009.

=== Mergers and acquisitions ===
RELX Group has been active in mergers and acquisitions. Elsevier has incorporated other businesses that were either complementing or competing in the field of research and publishing and that reinforce its market power, such as Mendeley (after the closure of 2collab), SSRN, bepress/Digital Commons, PlumX, Hivebench, Newsflo, Science-Metrix, and Interfolio.

=== Conferences ===
Elsevier also conducts conferences, exhibitions, and workshops around the world, with over 50 conferences a year covering life sciences, physical sciences and engineering, social sciences, and health sciences.

=== Shill review offer ===
According to the BBC, in 2009, the firm [Elsevier] offered a £17.25 Amazon voucher to academics who contributed to the textbook &quot;Clinical Psychology&quot; if they would go on Amazon.com and Barnes &amp; Noble (a large US books retailer) and give it five stars. Elsevier responded by stating &quot;Encouraging interested parties to post book reviews isn&#x27;t outside the norm in scholarly publishing, nor is it wrong to offer to nominally compensate people for their time. But in all instances the request should be unbiased, with no incentives for a positive review, and that&#x27;s where this particular e-mail went too far&quot;, and that it was a mistake by a marketing employee.

=== Blocking text mining research ===
Elsevier seeks to regulate text and data mining with private licenses, claiming that reading requires extra permission if automated and that the publisher holds copyright on output of automated processes. The conflict on research and copyright policy has often resulted in researchers being blocked from their work. In November 2015, Elsevier blocked a scientist from performing text mining research at scale on Elsevier papers, even though his institution already pays for access to Elsevier journal content. The data was collected using the R package &quot;statcheck&quot;.

=== Fossil fuel company consulting and advocacy ===
Elsevier is one of the most prolific publishers of books aimed at expanding the production of fossil fuels. Since at least 2010 the company has worked with the fossil fuel industry to optimise fossil fuel extraction. It commissions authors, journal advisory board members and editors who are employees of the largest oil firms. In addition it markets data services and research portals directly to the fossil fuel industry to help &quot;increase the odds of exploration success&quot;.

== Criticism of academic practices ==

=== &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Peer Review&quot; ===
In 2013, one of Elsevier&#x27;s journals was caught in the sting set up by John Bohannon, published in &quot;Science&quot;, called &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Peer Review?&quot; The journal &quot;Drug Invention Today&quot; accepted an obviously bogus paper made up by Bohannon that should have been rejected by any good peer-review system. Instead, &quot;Drug Invention Today&quot; was among many open-access journals that accepted the fake paper for publication. As of 2014, this journal had been transferred to a different publisher.

=== Fake journals ===

At a 2009 court case in Australia where Merck &amp; Co. was being sued by a user of Vioxx, the plaintiff alleged that Merck had paid Elsevier to publish the &quot;Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine&quot;, which had the appearance of being a peer-reviewed academic journal but in fact contained only articles favourable to Merck drugs. Merck described the journal as a &quot;complimentary publication&quot;, denied claims that articles within it were ghost written by Merck, and stated that the articles were all reprinted from peer-reviewed medical journals. In May 2009, Elsevier Health Sciences CEO Hansen released a statement regarding Australia-based sponsored journals, conceding that they were &quot;sponsored article compilation publications, on behalf of pharmaceutical clients, that were made to look like journals and lacked the proper disclosures&quot;. The statement acknowledged that it &quot;was an unacceptable practice&quot;. &quot;The Scientist&quot; reported that, according to an Elsevier spokesperson, six sponsored publications &quot;were put out by their Australia office and bore the Excerpta Medica imprint from 2000 to 2005&quot;, namely the &quot;Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine&quot; (&quot;Australas. J. Bone Joint Med.&quot;), the &quot;Australasian Journal of General Practice&quot; (&quot;Australas. J. Gen. Pract.&quot;), the &quot;Australasian Journal of Neurology&quot; (&quot;Australas. J. Neurol.&quot;), the &quot;Australasian Journal of Cardiology&quot; (&quot;Australas. J. Cardiol.&quot;), the &quot;Australasian Journal of Clinical Pharmacy&quot; (&quot;Australas. J. Clin. Pharm.&quot;), and the &quot;Australasian Journal of Cardiovascular Medicine&quot; (&quot;Australas. J. Cardiovasc. Med.&quot;). Excerpta Medica was a &quot;strategic medical communications agency&quot; run by Elsevier, according to the imprint&#x27;s web page. In October 2010, Excerpta Medica was acquired by Adelphi Worldwide.

=== &quot;Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals&quot; ===
There was speculation that the editor-in-chief of Elsevier journal &quot;Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals&quot;, Mohamed El Naschie, misused his power to publish his own work without appropriate peer review. The journal had published 322 papers with El Naschie as author since 1993. The last issue of December 2008 featured five of his papers. The controversy was covered extensively in blogs. The publisher announced in January 2009 that El Naschie had retired as editor-in-chief. the co-Editors-in-Chief of the journal were Maurice Courbage and Paolo Grigolini. In June 2011, El Naschie sued the journal &quot;Nature&quot; for libel, claiming that his reputation had been damaged by their November 2008 article about his retirement, which included statements that &quot;Nature&quot; had been unable to verify his claimed affiliations with certain international institutions. The suit came to trial in November 2011 and was dismissed in July 2012, with the judge ruling that the article was &quot;substantially true&quot;, contained &quot;honest comment&quot;, and was &quot;the product of responsible journalism&quot;. The judgement noted that El Naschie, who represented himself in court, had failed to provide any documentary evidence that his papers had been peer-reviewed. Judge Victoria Sharp also found &quot;reasonable and serious grounds&quot; for suspecting that El Naschie used a range of false names to defend his editorial practice in communications with &quot;Nature&quot;, and described this behavior as &quot;curious&quot; and &quot;bizarre&quot;.

=== Plagiarism ===
Elsevier&#x27;s &#x27;Duties of Authors&#x27; states that authors should ensure they have written entirely original works, and that proper acknowledgement of others&#x27; work must always be given. Elsevier claims plagiarism in all its forms constitutes unethical behaviour. Some Elsevier journals automatically screen submissions for plagiarism, but not all.

Albanian politician Taulant Muka claimed that Elsevier journal &quot;Procedia&quot; had plagiarized in the abstract of one of its articles. It is unclear whether or not Muka had access to the entirety of the article.

=== Scientific racism ===
Angela Saini has criticized the two Elsevier journals &quot;Intelligence&quot; and &quot;Personality and Individual Differences&quot; for having included on their editorial boards such well-known proponents of scientific racism as Richard Lynn and Gerhard Meisenberg; in response to her inquiries, Elsevier defended their presence as editors. The journal &quot;Intelligence&quot; has been criticized for having &quot;occasionally included papers with pseudoscientific findings about intelligence differences between races&quot;. It is the official journal of the International Society for Intelligence Research, which organizes the controversial series of conferences London Conference on Intelligence, described by the &quot;New Statesman&quot; as a forum for scientific racism.

In response to a 2019 open letter, efforts by Retraction Watch and a petition signed by over 1000 people, on 17 June 2020 Elsevier announced it was retracting an article that J. Philippe Rushton and Donald Templer published in 2012 in the Elsevier journal &quot;Personality and Individual Differences&quot;. The article had claimed that there was scientific evidence that skin color was related to aggression and sexuality in humans.

One of their journals, &quot;Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis&quot;, was involved in the manipulation of the peer review report.

=== Manipulation of bibliometrics ===

According to the signatories of the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (see also Goodhart&#x27;s law), commercial academic publishers benefit from manipulation of bibliometrics and scientometrics, such as the journal impact factor. The impact factor, which is often used as a proxy of prestige, can influence revenues, subscriptions, and academics&#x27; willingness to contribute unpaid work. However, there&#x27;s evidence suggesting that reliability of published research works in several fields may &quot;decrease&quot; with increasing journal rank.

Nine Elsevier journals, which exhibited unusual levels of self-citation, had their journal impact factor of 2019 suspended from &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot; in 2020, a sanction that hit 34 journals in total.

In 2023, the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, which is published by Elsevier, was criticized for desk-rejecting a submitted article for the main reason that it did not cite enough articles from the same journal.

== Control of journals ==

=== Resignation of editorial boards ===

The editorial boards of a number of journals have resigned because of disputes with Elsevier over pricing:
* In 1999, the entire editorial board of the &quot;Journal of Logic Programming&quot; resigned after 16 months of unsuccessful negotiations with Elsevier about the price of library subscriptions. The personnel created a new journal, &quot;Theory and Practice of Logic Programming&quot;, with Cambridge University Press at a much lower price, while Elsevier continued publication with a new editorial board and a slightly different name (the &quot;Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming&quot;). 
* In 2002, dissatisfaction at Elsevier&#x27;s pricing policies caused the European Economic Association to terminate an agreement with Elsevier designating Elsevier&#x27;s &quot;European Economic Review&quot; as the official journal of the association. The EEA launched a new journal, the &quot;Journal of the European Economic Association&quot;. 
* In 2003, the entire editorial board of the &quot;Journal of Algorithms&quot; resigned to start &quot;ACM Transactions on Algorithms&quot; with a different, lower-priced, not-for-profit publisher, at the suggestion of &quot;Journal of Algorithms&quot; founder Donald Knuth. The &quot;Journal of Algorithms&quot; continued under Elsevier with a new editorial board until October 2009, when it was discontinued.
* In 2005, the editors of the &quot;International Journal of Solids and Structures&quot; resigned to start the &quot;Journal of Mechanics of Materials and Structures&quot;. However, a new editorial board was quickly established and the journal continues in apparently unaltered form. 
* In 2006, the entire editorial board of the distinguished mathematical journal &quot;Topology&quot; resigned because of stalled negotiations with Elsevier to lower the subscription price. This board then launched the new &quot;Journal of Topology&quot; at a far lower price, under the auspices of the London Mathematical Society. &quot;Topology&quot; then remained in circulation under a new editorial board until 2009.
* In 2023, the editorial board of the open access journal NeuroImage resigned and started a new journal, because of Elsevier&#x27;s unwillingness to reduce article-processing charges. The editors called Elsevier&#x27;s $3,450 per article processing charge &quot;unethical and unsustainable&quot;.

Editorial boards have also resigned over open access policies or other issues:
* In 2015, Stephen Leeder was removed from his role as editor of the &quot;Medical Journal of Australia&quot; when its publisher decided to outsource the journal&#x27;s production to Elsevier. As a consequence, all but one of the journal&#x27;s editorial advisory committee members co-signed a letter of resignation. 
* In 2015, the entire editorial staff of the general linguistics journal &quot;Lingua&quot; resigned in protest of Elsevier&#x27;s unwillingness to agree to their terms of Fair Open Access. Editor-in-chief Johan Rooryck also announced that the &quot;Lingua&quot; staff would establish a new journal, &quot;Glossa&quot;. 
* In 2019, the entire editorial board of Elsevier&#x27;s &quot;Journal of Informetrics&quot; resigned over the open-access policies of its publisher and founded open-access journal called &quot;Quantitative Science Studies&quot;. 
* In 2020, Elsevier effectively severed the tie between the &quot;Journal of Asian Economics&quot; and the academic society that founded it, the American Committee on Asian Economic Studies (ACAES), by offering the ACAES-appointed editor, Calla Wiemer, a terminal contract for 2020. As a result, a majority of the editorial board eventually resigned.
* In 2023, the editorial board of the journal &quot;Design Studies&quot; resigned over Elsevier&#x27;s 1) plans to increase publications seven-fold; 2) the appointment of an external Editor-in-Chief who had not previously published in the journal; and 3) changing the scope of the journal without consulting the editorial team or the journal&#x27;s parent society.
* In December, 2024, the editorial board of &quot;Journal of Human Evolution&quot;, including emeritus editors and all but one associate editor, resigned, citing actions by Elsevier that they said &quot;are fundamentally incompatible with the ethos of the journal and preclude maintaining the quality and integrity fundamental to JHE&#x27;s success&quot;. In addition to pricing, specific complaints also included interference in the editorial board, lack of necessary support from the company, and the disruptive use of generative artificial intelligence by the company to alter submissions without informing editors or contributors.

=== &quot;The Cost of Knowledge&quot; boycott ===
In 2003, various university librarians began coordinating with each other to complain about Elsevier&#x27;s &quot;big deal&quot; journal bundling packages, in which the company offered a group of journal subscriptions to libraries at a certain rate, but in which librarians claimed no economical option was available to subscribe to only the popular journals at a rate comparable to the bundled rate. Librarians continued to discuss the implications of the pricing schemes, many feeling pressured into buying the Elsevier packages without other options.

On 21 January 2012, mathematician Timothy Gowers publicly announced he would boycott Elsevier, noting that others in the field have been doing so privately. The reasons for the boycott are high subscription prices for individual journals, bundling subscriptions to journals of different value and importance, and Elsevier&#x27;s support for SOPA, PIPA, and the Research Works Act, which would have prohibited open-access mandates for U.S. federally-funded research and severely restricted the sharing of scientific data.

Following this, a petition advocating noncooperation with Elsevier (that is, not submitting papers to Elsevier journals, not refereeing articles in Elsevier journals, and not participating in journal editorial boards), appeared on the site &quot;The Cost of Knowledge&quot;. By February 2012, this petition had been signed by over 5,000 academics, growing to over 17,000 by November 2018. The firm disputed the claims, claiming that their prices are below the industry average, and stating that bundling is only one of several different options available to buy access to Elsevier journals. The company also claimed that its profit margins are &quot;simply a consequence of the firm&#x27;s efficient operation&quot;. The academics replied that their work was funded by public money, thus should be freely available.

On 27 February 2012, Elsevier issued a statement on its website that declared that it has withdrawn support from the Research Works Act. Although the Cost of Knowledge movement was not mentioned, the statement indicated the hope that the move would &quot;help create a less heated and more productive climate&quot; for ongoing discussions with research funders. Hours after Elsevier&#x27;s statement, the sponsors of the bill, US House Representatives Darrell Issa and Carolyn Maloney, issued a joint statement saying that they would not push the bill in Congress.

=== Plan S ===
The Plan S open-access initiative, which began in Europe and has since spread to some US research funding agencies, would require researchers receiving some grants to publish in open-access journals by 2020. A spokesman for Elsevier said &quot;If you think that information should be free of charge, go to Wikipedia&quot;. In September 2018, UBS advised to sell Elsevier (RELX) stocks, noting that Plan S could affect 5-10% of scientific funding and may force Elsevier to reduce pricing.

== Relationship with Academic Institutions ==

=== Finland ===
In 2015, Finnish research organizations paid a total of 27 million euros in subscription fees. Over one-third of the total costs went to Elsevier. The information was revealed after successful court appeal following a denied request on the subscription fees, due to confidentiality clauses in contracts with the publishers. Establishing of this fact lead to creation of tiedonhinta.fi petition demanding more reasonable pricing and open access to content signed by more than 2800 members of the research community. While deals with other publishers have been made, this was not the case for Elsevier, leading to the nodealnoreview.org boycott of the publisher signed more than 600 times.

In January 2018, it was confirmed that a deal had been reached between those concerned.

=== France ===
The French Couperin consortium agreed in 2019 to a 4-year contract with Elsevier, despite criticism from the scientific community.

The French École Normale Supérieure has stopped having Elsevier publish the journal &quot;Annales Scientifiques de l&#x27;École Normale Supérieure&quot; (as of 2008).

Effective on 1 January 2020, the French Academy of Sciences stopped publishing its 7 journals Comptes rendus de l&#x27;Académie des Sciences with Elsevier and switched to Centre Mersenne.

=== Germany ===
Since 2018 and as of 2023, almost no academic institution in Germany is subscribed to Elsevier.

Germany&#x27;s DEAL project (Projekt DEAL), which includes over 60 major research institutions, has announced that all of its members are cancelling their contracts with Elsevier, effective 1 January 2017. The boycott is in response to Elsevier&#x27;s refusal to adopt &quot;transparent business models&quot; to &quot;make publications more openly accessible&quot;. Horst Hippler, spokesperson for the DEAL consortium states that &quot;taxpayers have a right to read what they are paying for&quot; and that &quot;publishers must understand that the route to open-access publishing at an affordable price is irreversible&quot;. In July 2017, another 13 institutions announced that they would also be cancelling their subscriptions to Elsevier journals. In August 2017, at least 185 German institutions had cancelled their contracts with Elsevier. In 2018, whilst negotiations were ongoing, around 200 German universities that cancelled their subscriptions to Elsevier journals were granted complimentary open access to them until this ended in July of the year.

On 19 December 2018, the Max Planck Society (MPS) announced that the existing subscription agreement with Elsevier would not be renewed after the expiration date of 31 December 2018. MPS counts 14,000 scientists in 84 research institutes, publishing 12,000 articles each year.

In 2023 Elsevier and DEAL reached a tentative agreement on a publish and read model, which would take effect until 2028 if at least 70% of the eligible institutions opt into it.

=== Hungary ===
In March 2018, the Hungarian &quot;Electronic Information Service National Programme&quot; entered negotiations on its 2019 Elsevier subscriptions, asking for a read-and-publish deal. Negotiations were ended by the Hungarian consortium in December 2018, and the subscription was not renewed.

=== Iran ===
In 2013, Elsevier changed its policies in response to sanctions announced by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control that year. This included a request that all Elsevier journals avoid publishing papers by Iranian nationals who are employed by the Iranian government. Elsevier executive Mark Seeley expressed regret on behalf of the company, but did not announce an intention to challenge this interpretation of the law.

=== Italy ===
CRUI (an association of Italian universities) sealed a 5-year-long deal for 2018–2022, despite protests from the scientific community, protests focused on aspects such as the lack of prevention of cost increases by means of the double dipping.

=== Netherlands ===
In 2015, a consortium of all of Netherlands&#x27; 14 universities threatened to boycott Elsevier if it could not agree that articles by Dutch authors would be made open access and settled with the compromise of 30% of its Dutch papers becoming open access by 2018. Gerard Meijer, president of Radboud University in Nijmegen and lead negotiator on the Dutch side noted, &quot;it&#x27;s not the 100% that I hoped for&quot;.

=== Norway ===
In March 2019, the Norwegian government on behalf of 44 institutions — universities, university colleges, research institutes, and hospitals — decided to break negotiations on renewal of their subscription deal with Elsevier, because of disagreement regarding open-access policy and Elsevier&#x27;s unwillingness to reduce the cost of reading access.

=== South Korea ===
In 2017, over 70 university libraries confirmed a &quot;contract boycott&quot; movement involving three publishers including Elsevier. As of January 2018, whilst negotiations remain underway, a decision will be made as to whether or not continue the participating libraries will continue the boycott. It was subsequently confirmed that an agreement had been reached.

=== Sweden ===
In May 2018, the Bibsam Consortium, which negotiates license agreements on behalf of all Swedish universities and research institutes, decided not to renew their contract with Elsevier, alleging that the publisher does not meet the demands of transition towards a more open-access model, and referring to the rapidly increasing costs for publishing. Swedish universities will still have access to articles published before 30 June 2018. Astrid Söderbergh Widding, chairman of the Bibsam Consortium, said, &quot;the current system for scholarly communication must change and our only option is to cancel deals when they don&#x27;t meet our demands for a sustainable transition to open access&quot;. Sweden has a goal of open access by 2026. In November 2019 the negotiations concluded, with Sweden paying for reading access to Elsevier journals and open access publishing for all its researchers&#x27; articles.

=== Taiwan ===
In Taiwan, more than 75% of universities, including the country&#x27;s top 11 institutions, have joined a collective boycott against Elsevier. On 7 December 2016, the Taiwanese consortium, CONCERT, which represents more than 140 institutions, announced it would not renew its contract with Elsevier.

=== United States ===
In March 2018, Florida State University&#x27;s faculty elected to cancel its $2 million subscription to a bundle of several journals. Starting in 2019, it will instead buy access to titles&quot; à la carte&quot;.

In February 2019, the University of California said it would terminate subscriptions &quot;in [a] push for open access to publicly funded research&quot;. After months of negotiations over open access to research by UC researchers and prices for subscriptions to Elsevier journals, a press release by the UC Office of the President issued Thursday, 28 February 2019 stated &quot;Under Elsevier&#x27;s proposed terms, the publisher would have charged UC authors large publishing fees on top of the university&#x27;s multimillion dollar subscription, resulting in much greater cost to the university and much higher profits for Elsevier.&quot; On 10 July 2019, Elsevier began restricting access to all new paywalled articles and approximately 5% of paywalled articles published before 2019.

In April 2020, the University of North Carolina elected not to renew its bundled Elsevier package, citing a failure &quot;to provide an affordable path&quot;. Rather than extend the license, which was stated to cost $2.6 million annually, the university decided to continue subscribing to a smaller set of individual journals. The State University of New York Libraries Consortium also announced similar outcome, with the help of estimates from Unpaywall Journals. Similarly, MIT announced in June 2020 that it would no longer pay for access to new Elsevier articles.

In 2022 Elsevier and the University of Michigan established an agreement to support authors who wish to publish open access.

=== Ukraine ===
In June 2020 the Ukrainian government cancelled subscriptions for all universities in the country after failed negotiations. The Ministry of Education claimed that Elsevier indexes journals in its register that call themselves Russian but are from &quot;occupied territories&quot;.

== Dissemination of research ==

=== Lobbying efforts against open access ===
Elsevier have been known to be involved in lobbying against open access. These have included the likes of:
*The Federal Research Public Access Act (FRPPA)
*The Research Works Act
*PRISM. In the case of PRISM, the Association of American Publishers hired Eric Dezenhall, the so-called &quot;Pit Bull Of Public Relations&quot;.
*Horizon 2020
*Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)
*The European Union&#x27;s Open Science Monitor was criticised after Elsevier were confirmed as a subcontractor.
*UK Research and Innovation

=== Selling open-access articles ===
In 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, Elsevier was found to be selling some articles that should have been open access, but had been put behind a paywall. A related case occurred in 2015, when Elsevier charged for downloading an open-access article from a journal published by John Wiley &amp; Sons. However, whether Elsevier was in violation of the license under which the article was made available on their website was not clear.

=== Action against academics posting their own articles online ===
In 2013, Digimarc, a company representing Elsevier, told the University of Calgary to remove articles published by faculty authors on university web pages; although such self-archiving of academic articles may be legal under the fair dealing provisions in Canadian copyright law, the university complied. Harvard University and the University of California, Irvine also received takedown notices for self-archived academic articles, a first for Harvard, according to Peter Suber.

Months after its acquisition of Academia.edu rival Mendeley, Elsevier sent thousands of takedown notices to Academia.edu, a practice that has since ceased following widespread complaint by academics, according to Academia.edu founder and chief executive Richard Price.

After Elsevier acquired the repository SSRN in May 2016, academics started complaining that some of their work has been removed without notice. The action was explained as a technical error.

=== Sci-Hub and LibGen lawsuit ===
In 2015, Elsevier filed a lawsuit against the sites Sci-Hub and LibGen, which make copyright-protected articles available for free. Elsevier also claimed illegal access to institutional accounts.

=== Initial rejection of the Initiative for Open Citations ===
Among the major academic publishers, Elsevier alone declined to join the Initiative for Open Citations. In the context of the resignation of the &quot;Journal of Informetrics&quot;″ editorial board, the firm stated: &quot;Elsevier invests significantly in citation extraction technology. While these are made available to those who wish to license this data, Elsevier cannot make such a large corpus of data, to which it has added significant value, available for free.&quot;

Elsevier finally joined the initiative in January 2021 after the data was already available with an Open Data Commons license in Microsoft Academic.

=== ResearchGate take down ===

A chamber of the Munich Regional Court has ruled that the research networking site ResearchGate has to take down articles uploaded without consent from their original publishers and ResearchGate must take down Elsevier articles. A case was brought forward in 2017 by the Coalition for Responsible Sharing, a group of publishers that includes Elsevier and the American Chemical Society.

== Antitrust lawsuit ==
In September 2024, Lucina Uddin, a neuroscience professor at UCLA, sued Elsevier along with five other academic journal publishers in a proposed class-action lawsuit, alleging that the publishers violated antitrust law by agreeing not to compete against each other for manuscripts and by denying scholars payment for peer review services.

== Awards ==

Elsevier has partnered with a number of organisations and lent its name to several awards.

Since 1987, Elsevier has partnered with the academic journal &quot;Spectrochimica Acta Part B&quot; to award the Elsevier / Spectrochimica Acta Atomic Spectroscopy Award. This award is given each year for a jury-selected best paper of the year. The award is worth $1000.

Starting in 1987, the IBMS Elsevier Award was awarded in 1992, 1995, 1998, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007 by the International Bone and Mineral Society in partnership with Elsevier, &quot;for outstanding research and teaching throughout their career by an IBMS member in the fields of bone and mineral metabolism&quot;.

From 2007, the Coordenação de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) in Brazil partnered with Elsevier to award the CAPES Elsevier Award, the award being restricted to women from 2013 to encourage more women to pursue scientific careers. Several awards were awarded each year, as of 2014.

From 2011, the OWSD-Elsevier Foundation Awards for Early-Career Women Scientists in the Developing World (OWSD-Elsevier Foundation Awards) have been awarded annually to early-career women scientists in selected developing countries in four regions: Latin America and the Caribbean, East and Southeast Asia and the Pacific, Central and South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. The Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World (OWSD), the Elsevier Foundation, and The World Academy of Sciences first partnered to recognize achievements of early-career women scientists in developing countries in 2011.

In 2016, the Elsevier Foundation awarded the Elsevier Foundation-ISC3 Green and Sustainable Chemistry Challenge. From 2021 and , the annual award is known as the Elsevier Foundation Chemistry for Climate Action Challenge. Two prizes have been awarded each year; until 2020, the first prizewinner was awarded €50,000, and the second prize was €25,000. Since then, €25,000 has been awarded to each winner, usually an entrepreneur who has created a project or proposal that aids the fight against climate change.

== Imprints ==
Elsevier uses its imprints (that is, brand names used in publishing) to market to different consumer segments. Many of the imprints have previously been the names of publishing companies that were purchased by Reed Elsevier.

<text>Beverley June Hughes, Baroness Hughes of Stretford (born 30 March 1950) is a British politician who most recently served as Deputy Mayor of Greater Manchester for Policing and Crime between 2017 and 2023. A member of the Labour Party, Hughes was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Stretford and Urmston from 1997 to 2010. In 2004, she was appointed to the Privy Council. From 2005 to 2009, she served in the Government as the Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families.

==Early life and education==
Beverley Hughes was born in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire in 1950 and was educated at Ellesmere Port Girls&#x27; Grammar School (now called The Whitby High School) on Sycamore Drive in Whitby, Ellesmere Port. She moved to Flixton in 1976, and has lived there ever since.

Hughes studied for a BSc in Social Science at the University of Manchester, graduating in 1971. After graduation she continued her studies at the University of Manchester, carrying out postgraduate research into the care of people with schizophrenia, for which she was awarded a Master of Science degree in 1978. She also gained a Diploma in Applied Social Studies in 1974 from the University of Liverpool. She worked as a probation officer in Merseyside from 1971 to 1976.

From 1976 to 1997 Hughes worked first as a research associate, then lecturer (from 1981) and then a senior lecturer in the Department of Social Policy at the University of Manchester, a department that she became the head of in 1994.

==Political career==
Hughes&#x27; political career began with election to Trafford Borough Council in 1986. She established herself, and was appointed leader of the council&#x27;s Labour Group in 1992. She became Trafford Borough Council Leader in 1995, remaining in the post until her election to the UK Parliament at the 1997 general election.

From June 1997 to July 1998, she was a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, until she was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to Hilary Armstrong, Minister for Local Government and Housing. In July 1999 she was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. In 2001, she was appointed the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Prisons and Probation in the Home Office.

In July 2001, she received significant ridicule and criticism in the media after it was revealed that along with other politicians she had repeatedly denounced an edition of the Channel 4 television show &quot;Brass Eye&quot; as being &quot;unbelievably sick&quot;, but then subsequently admitting that she&#x27;d never seen it and refused to ever watch it. The programme was in fact parodying hysteria surrounding the issue of paedophilia and the media, thus commentators suggested that extreme reactions such as those by Hughes had in fact emphasised the need for such programming. Sir Paul Fox criticised Hughes and her colleagues suggesting they &quot;have to have the courtesy to have seen the programme before they go in at the deep end&quot;, with Christopher Howse even more critical, suggesting &quot;it was as if paedophilia were sacred and not to be blasphemed against&quot; and that the idiocy of Hughes&#x27; performance on the affair was &quot;hard to beat&quot;.

In 2002, Hughes was appointed Minister of State for Immigration, Citizenship and Counter Terrorism, but was forced to resign in April 2004 when it was shown that she had been informed of procedural improprieties concerning the granting of visas to certain categories of workers from Eastern Europe – she had earlier told the House of Commons that if she had been aware of such facts she would have done something about it.

Upon resignation, she made clear that she had not set out to &quot;intentionally mislead anyone&quot;, but she could not &quot;in conscience continue to serve as immigration minister&quot;. The prime minister replaced Hughes with Work and Pensions Minister Des Browne.

She was re-appointed into government after the 2005 general election as the Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families in the Department for Education and Skills. She became the Regional Minister for the North West as of 19 July 2007.

On 2 June 2009, Hughes announced she was resigning her ministerial position of Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families within that week following the Local and European elections with a cabinet reshuffle anticipated. She stood down at the 2010 General Election for &quot;personal reasons&quot; and specifically denied that she was standing down due to the ongoing expenses scandal. She was made a life peer on 15 July 2010 taking the title Baroness Hughes of Stretford, of Ellesmere Port in the County of Cheshire.

On 6 May 2017, Hughes was appointed as Deputy Mayor of Greater Manchester for Policing and Crime by Greater Manchester Combined Authority mayor, and former Shadow Home Secretary, Andy Burnham. On 9 January 2023 Hughes retired as Deputy Mayor, with Kate Green succeeding her.

==Personal life==
She married Thomas McDonald in 1973 in West Cheshire and has three grown up children: one son and two daughters.

<text>The Secret of the Old Clock is the first volume in the &quot;Nancy Drew Mystery Stories&quot; series, written under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene. It was first published on April 28, 1930, and rewritten in 1959 by Harriet Stratemeyer Adams.

Nancy Drew is a sixteen-year-old high school graduate (her age was changed to eighteen in the 1959 rewrite). Her father, Carson Drew, is a well-known criminal defense lawyer. The Drews reside in River Heights and employ a housekeeper, Hannah Gruen. In early editions, she is depicted as a mere servant; later in the series, she becomes more of a family member.

In 2001, the novel ranked 53rd on &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;&#x27;s list of the all-time best-selling hardcover children&#x27;s books in English, having sold about 2.7 million copies.

==Summaries==

===1930 edition===

Sixteen-year-old attractive, golden-haired Nancy Drew wishes to help the Turners, who are struggling relatives of the recently deceased Josiah Crowley, by finding a missing will that can give them claim to Crowely&#x27;s estate. Aided along the way by friend Helen Corning, she becomes interested in the case because she dislikes Crowley&#x27;s snobbish &quot;nouveau-riche&quot; social-climbing heirs presumptive, the Tophams.

A nasty encounter at a department store allows Nancy to discredit the Topham sisters when they break an expensive imported vase. Interviewing various Crowley relatives and friends, Nancy learns from an injured old lady that Crowley hinted that the clue to his will would be found in the family clock. When Helen gives Nancy charity tickets to sell, she sells them to the Tophams to gain entry to their home and quiz them about the clock.

Nancy then joins Helen at summer camp to investigate the Topham summer home nearby. There, she is overpowered by the burglar who stole the Crowley Clock and the rest of the Topham furniture. She is left bound and gagged in the vacant house while the caretaker is locked in a shed nearby. She is able to obtain the titular clock while the burglars drink wine and beer heavily (and illegally) at a wayside inn. (Prohibition in the United States was in force in 1930.)

Nancy is depicted as intentionally hiding stolen evidence (the clock) from the police and gunfire is involved in the police-robber chase. A climactic scene, inserted before the denouement and epilogue, has Nancy delighted to take the money from the Tophams and see it distributed to destitute family and friends.

Nancy comes across as very strong-willed, but also competitive with the Tophams. Although charitable and altruistic to the poor heirs, she enjoys seeing others in River Heights society lose their status earned by new money rather than character.

===1959 revision===
In the Harriet Adams rewrite, Nancy is depicted as a less impulsive, less headstrong girl of Edward Stratemeyer&#x27;s and Mildred Benson&#x27;s vision, to a milder, more sedate and refined girl— &quot;more sugar and less spice&quot;, with an extensive wardrobe and a more charitable outlook. Helen now appears older, perhaps in preparation for her eventual &quot;write-out&quot; after Volume 4 of the revised series (no explanation is made in the original series) to introduce Bess and her cousin George. Readers have noted two figures illustrated in the same vein as the cousins appear in a 1959 illustration at a girls&#x27; camp). Racial stereotypes are omitted. Action is increased significantly and is faster-paced. Greater detail is given to develop Nancy and her home.

Relatives of Josiah Crowley are concerned that the selfish &quot;nouveau riche&quot; social-climbing heirs presumptive, the snobbish Tophams, have taken him into their home and do not let him visit other family members, including the Turner and Hoover sisters. When Crowley dies, promises of being included in his will appear moot as the will, held by the Tophams, wills everything to them. Eighteen-year-old Nancy Drew is prompted to help the Crowley kin by her affection for Crowley&#x27;s distant niece, little Judy, who is being raised by the elderly Turner sisters.

While looking for the Hoover sisters, Nancy happens upon their farm during a downpour and shelters with them to dry off because her convertible top malfunctioned. In the original version, the sisters wanted to improve their hatchery and dressmaking skills; here, Allison Hoover wants to take singing lessons.

Nancy&#x27;s encounter with the undeserving Topham sisters now centers around a torn evening dress instead of a broken vase, as in the original story. Nancy catches up with the thieves when they stop to dine, instead of drinking illegal-era alcohol.

The final scene, the reading of the will that disinherits the Tophams, focuses on the delight of rewarding the deserving Crowley kin, instead of Nancy&#x27;s desire to down-class the snobbish Topham family.

== Artwork ==

The 1930s edition was published with the white-spine dust jacket, with artwork by Russell H. Tandy, and four glossy black-and-white interior illustrations, also by Tandy. The first edition is readily distinguished from later editions by its lack of a silhouette on the front cover, and blank end pages. However, a few printings occurred (through 1932) before these trademarks were added to the series.
In 1937, three of the illustrations were eliminated, leaving only a frontispiece, and additional information and illustration were added to the dust jacket. In 1943, the interior frontispiece art was updated to conform to current 1940s style. In 1950, the dust jacket was revamped as a wraparound jacket, with the picture continuing onto the spine of the book, and with cover art by Bill Gillies that was more in keeping with 1950s style. Gillies&#x27; Nancy, modeled after his wife, looks more mature than 16 (her age in the text at the time). She wears a 1950s version of her early trademark blue suit, and is kneeling so that the length, width, and general style are indeterminate, leaving the art less dated. The scene does not exactly match the text in the story.

In 1965, artist Rudy Nappi created new artwork for this title which is currently in print.

When the text was rewritten in 1959, five illustrations were added. The new text described the cover scene in detail. In 1960, this volume was given entirely new artwork, including eight ink drawings and a color frontispiece, which served as the jacket illustration, all by Polly Bolian, for the Reader&#x27;s Club (Cameo) edition.

In 1962, the publisher eliminated dust jackets and the books were issued with the art directly on the cover with yellow spines and backs using Bill Gillies&#x27; artwork.

In 1965, the cover art was updated with an illustration by Rudy Nappi, featuring the same dress Nancy wears on Gillies&#x27; cover for &quot;The Secret of the Wooden Lady&quot;. The internal illustrations remained intact and unchanged. While binding and spine designs have changed, the book&#x27;s cover, all art (except endpapers) and text remain unchanged.

On January 1, 2053, the revised text of &quot;The Secret of the Old Clock&quot; will pass into the Canadian public domain, as Harriet Adams died in 1982. However, the original text, as written by Mildred Benson (who died in 2002), and the character of Nancy Drew, will not enter the Canadian public domain until January 1, 2073, per the Canadian &quot;Copyright Act&quot;.

In the United States, the original text will enter the public domain in 2026 (95 years after it was first published), while the revised text will not enter the public domain until 2055.

==Adaptations ==
The 12th installment in the Nancy Drew point-and-click adventure game series by Her Interactive, named &quot;Nancy Drew: Secret of the Old Clock&quot;, is loosely based on the novel and also incorporate elements from &quot;The Hidden Staircase&quot;, &quot;The Bungalow Mystery&quot;, and &quot;The Mystery at Lilac Inn&quot;.

The story of the episode &quot;The Curse of the Dark Storm&quot; from the &quot;Nancy Drew&quot; television series is inspired by the novel. In the episode, Nancy and Ned find a clock hidden by Tiffany Hudson. The clock holds what Tiffany wanted Ned to have following her death.

<text>Fiona Margaret Mactaggart (born 12 September 1953) is a British politician and former primary school teacher who has been chair of the Fawcett Society since 2018. A member of the Labour Party, she was Member of Parliament (MP) for Slough from 1997 to 2017.

==Early life and career==

Mactaggart was educated at the independent Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College. She read for a BA in English at King&#x27;s College London, an MA at the Institute of Education and a PGCE at Goldsmiths, University of London. While at university, she was an outspoken member of the Young Students and Socialists Society and sought to live down her school days at Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College.

Mactaggart was vice-president and National Secretary of the National Union of Students from 1978 to 1981. She was Press and Public Relations Officer for the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) for six months before being General Secretary of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants from 1982 to 1987. She was a primary school teacher in Peckham from 1987 to 1992, noting &quot;I have a voice that children can hear at the other end of the playground&quot;.

She was elected to Wandsworth Council in 1986 to represent the Shaftesbury ward and was Leader of the Labour Group from 1988 to 1990, when she lost her seat. From 1992 to 1997, she was a lecturer in Primary Education at the Institute of Education and Chair of Liberty, the civil liberties rights pressure group. While a primary school teacher, she decided to become an MP, as being able to change the world &quot;thirty kids at a time&quot; seemed too slow for her. She is a feminist.

==Parliamentary career==
Mactaggart was elected as Labour MP for Slough in 1997. She was selected to stand for election for Labour through an all-women shortlist. From May 2003, until she asked to leave her post in the 5 May 2006 Cabinet reshuffle, she served at the Home Office as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Criminal Justice, Race and Victims.

In 2004, Mactaggart attracted criticism for a reluctance to condemn violent protests by Sikhs which led to the cancellation of the play &quot;Behzti&quot; at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. Around a thousand protesters stormed the production, set in a temple, at the opening of the curtain. Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Mactaggart said: &quot;I think that when people are moved by theatre to protest, in a way that&#x27;s a sign of the free speech which is so much part of the British tradition. I think that it&#x27;s a great thing that people care enough about a performance to protest&quot;. Mactaggart also suggested the play and its author would benefit from the violent protests, adding that the controversy was &quot;a sign of a lively flourishing cultural life&quot;.

In November 2008, Mactaggart attracted criticism for using unreliable statistics during a parliamentary debate on prostitution. Mactaggart was asked how those criminalised by a new law were supposed to know if a prostitute had been trafficked or not. She replied &quot;I think they can guess... something like 80% of women in prostitution are controlled by their drug dealer, their pimp, or their trafficker.&quot; When questioned on her claim she stated that it &quot;came from an official Government publication into prostitution and the sex trade&quot;. However, a BBC magazine article states that &quot;it is impossible to find that number in any research done on this subject.&quot; The Home Office have also stated that they &quot;do not endorse or use the figure that 80 per cent of prostitutes are controlled by others&quot;. The controversy continued in January 2009 when Mactaggart told the House of Commons that she regarded all women prostitutes as the victims of trafficking, because their route into the sector &quot;almost always involves coercion, enforced addiction to drugs and violence from their pimps or traffickers.&quot; Again this claim is not supported by any known research.

In May 2011, Mactaggart was criticised by the Association of Political Thought for calling some of the views of London School of Economics professor of political and gender theory Anne Phillips &quot;frankly nauseating&quot; because of her supposed support for prostitution. This assessment was based on the existence of a question on an LSE reading list about the ethical differences between legal waged labour and prostitution. Mactaggart had previously caused controversy with her hard-line approach to the issue of prostitution by comparing men who use prostitutes to abusers of children, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t think most men who use prostitutes think of themselves as child abusers, but they are&quot;.

In October 2013, Mactaggart was one of only six Labour MPs – the others being Diane Abbott, Jeremy Corbyn, Kelvin Hopkins, John McDonnell and Dennis Skinner – to oppose Theresa May&#x27;s Immigration Act 2014. Four years later, the bill resulted in the Windrush scandal.

In February 2014 Mactaggart asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Iain Duncan Smith, if he would &quot;make it his policy not to offer job subsidies for employing teenagers as auxiliary workers in adult entertainment establishments&quot;. Her question related to employers in the adult entertainment industry being offered over £2,000 incentive from the Department for Work and Pensions for every unemployed young person (aged 18–24) that they hired. Esther McVey, the Minister of State for Employment, stated that &quot;The Welfare Reform Act 2012 ensured that vacancies which involve performing sexual activities were banned from being advertised on Government websites and a distinction was made in law to differentiate between performers and ancillary workers.&quot;

Later in 2014 Mactaggart was appointed to the Intelligence and Security Committee. She abstained in the September 2014 vote on whether or not to enter the war against ISIL.

In March 2015, she was appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom and therefore granted the title The Right Honourable.

Mactaggart stood down prior to the 2017 general election, citing how divisive politics had become. After standing down, she became chair of the Fawcett Society the following year.

==Personal life==
In 2003, Mactaggart received cancer treatment.

Her father, the late Sir Ian Mactaggart, Bt, was a multimillionaire Glasgow property developer, Conservative candidate and Eurosceptic. Her mother&#x27;s father, Sir Herbert Williams, Bt, was a Conservative Member of Parliament for 27 years. Her great-grandfather was Sir John Mactaggart, the first treasurer of the first branch of Keir Hardie&#x27;s Labour Party. Her father left her a fifth of his £6.5m estate, and it is thought she was the second richest Labour MP. Critics often make an issue of Mactaggart&#x27;s considerable wealth, with journalist Benedict Brogan describing her as &quot;a Scottish laird who is as wealthy as she is humourless&quot;.

Mactaggart owns three homes, one in London, one on the Isle of Islay and a flat in Slough. She has multiple sclerosis and is an ovarian cancer survivor. Her sister stood as a Parliamentary candidate for the Liberal Democrats in Devizes in the 1992 General Election.

Mactaggart donated £300,000 to the Labour Party in 2023.

<doc id="420567" wikidata="Q1493786" url="?curid=420567" title="Discrete optimization">
<text>Discrete optimization is a branch of optimization in applied mathematics and computer science. As opposed to continuous optimization, some or all of the variables used in a discrete optimization problem are restricted to be discrete variables—that is, to assume only a discrete set of values, such as the integers.

==Branches==
Three notable branches of discrete optimization are:
* combinatorial optimization, which refers to problems on graphs, matroids and other discrete structures
* integer programming 
* constraint programming
These branches are all closely intertwined however, since many combinatorial optimization problems 
can be modeled as integer programs (e.g. shortest path) or constraint programs,
any constraint program can be formulated as an integer program and vice versa,
and constraint and integer programs can often be given a combinatorial interpretation.

<text>Paul Gerard Goggins (16 June 1953 – 7 January 2014) was a British Labour politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Wythenshawe and Sale East from 1997 until his death in January 2014. He was also previously a Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office.

==Early life==
Paul Goggins was born in Manchester and educated at St Bede&#x27;s College, before going on to study at the Roman Catholic seminary Ushaw College (1971–1973), although he did not enter the priesthood. He went on to study at the Birmingham Polytechnic (now Birmingham City University), receiving a Certificate in Residential Care of Children and Young People in 1976. Later, he earned a Certificate of Qualification in Social Work from the Manchester Polytechnic in 1982.

He worked as a child care worker with the &#x27;Liverpool Catholic Social Services&#x27; for a year in 1974, before becoming an officer in charge at the Wigan Children&#x27;s Home in 1976. He was appointed as project director for the NCH Action for Children in Salford in 1984. He became the national director for Church Action on Poverty, a national church-based campaigning organisation, in 1989 where he remained until his election to Westminster.

==Political career==
He served as a councillor in the City of Salford from 1990 to 1998. He was elected to the House of Commons at the 1997 general election for the newly created Wythenshawe and Sale East seat vacated by the retirement of Alf Morris, the former Labour MP for Manchester Wythenshawe. Goggins held the safe Labour seat with a majority of 15,019 and remained the MP there for almost 17 years. He made his maiden speech on 20 May 1997.

He served on the social security select committee from 1997 until he was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Minister of State at the Department of Social Security John Denham in 1998, moving with Denham to the Department of Health in 1999.

In 2000 he was appointed PPS to the Secretary of State for Education and Employment David Blunkett, and he remained Blunketts&#x27;s PPS following the 2001 General Election in his new position as Home Secretary. It is during this period that, according to Blunkett, Goggins was lumbered with the nickname &#x27;Mrs Goggins&#x27;.

He was promoted to the government of Tony Blair in 2003, where he was made the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Home Office with the role of prisons and probation minister. He became the parliamentary under Secretary for State with responsibility for the voluntary and community sector. He forged links with various community and voluntary sector organisations such as ARVAC &quot;The Association for Research in the Voluntary and Community Sector&quot;. In May 2006, he was appointed as a junior minister at the Northern Ireland Office. He was the co-founder of the All Party Parliamentary Friends of CAFOD group and was Secretary of the All Party Parliamentary Group on poverty.

In February 2013, Goggins voted against the second reading of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. Subsequently, in May 2013 the MP voted against the bill’s third and final reading, opposing the legalisation of same-sex marriage within England and Wales.

==Personal life and death==
He married Wyn Bartley in 1977 in Crosby and they had two sons and a daughter.

He was a season ticket holder at Manchester City F.C. He was also a member of the Christian socialist movement who broadcast on the BBC Radio 4 &quot;Thought for the Day&quot; slot on the &quot;Today&quot; programme. In an interview on BBC Radio Five Live in 2004, he claimed his family was the inspiration for the &quot;Mrs Goggins&quot; character in the &quot;Postman Pat&quot; series.

On 30 December 2013, Goggins became seriously ill after collapsing while running, resulting in emergency surgery. He died in Salford Royal Hospital on 7 January 2014 following complications from a brain haemorrhage, having never regained consciousness.

<doc id="420575" wikidata="Q6737996" url="?curid=420575" title="Major-General's Song">
<text>&quot;I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General&quot; (often referred to as the &quot;Major-General&#x27;s Song&quot; or &quot;Modern Major-General&#x27;s Song&quot;) is a patter song from Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s 1879 comic opera &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;. It has been called the most famous Gilbert and Sullivan patter song. Sung by Major-General Stanley at his first entrance, towards the end of Act I, the character introduces himself by presenting his résumé as a polymath but admitting to fundamental shortcomings. He claims a wide range of classical, historical and scientific knowledge but admits that he knows little of military tactics, weapons or jargon. The song thereby satirises the idea of the &quot;modern&quot; educated British Army officer of the latter 19th century.

The song is replete with historical and cultural references, in which the Major-General describes his impressive and well-rounded education in non-military matters, but he says that his military knowledge has &quot;only been brought down to the beginning of the century&quot;. The stage directions in the libretto state that at the end of each verse the Major-General is &quot;bothered for a rhyme&quot;; interpolated business occurs here, and in each case he finds a rhyme and finishes the verse with a flourish.

The piece is difficult to perform because of the fast pace and tongue-twisting nature of the lyrics.

==Historical basis==
The character of Major-General Stanley was widely taken to be a caricature of the popular general Sir Garnet Wolseley. The biographer Michael Ainger, however, doubts that Gilbert intended a caricature of Wolseley, identifying instead the older General Henry Turner, an uncle of Gilbert&#x27;s wife whom Gilbert disliked, as a more likely inspiration for the satire. Nevertheless, in the original London production, George Grossmith imitated Wolseley&#x27;s mannerisms and appearance, particularly his large moustache, and the audience recognised the allusion. Wolseley himself, according to his biographer, took no offence at the identification and sometimes sang &quot;I am the very model of a modern Major-General&quot; for the private amusement of his family and friends.

==In popular culture==
===Film references===

&quot;The Pirate Movie&quot;, a 1982 modern musical parody of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, features many songs from the opera, including this song. Contemporary references were introduced, as when the Major-General adds to the song &quot;Man, I&#x27;m older than The Beatles, but I&#x27;m younger than The Rolling Stones.&quot; In the 1983 film &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot;, the hero sings the song. Similarly, in the 2001 time-travel comedy &quot;Kate &amp; Leopold&quot;, Leopold sings the song; however, the scene is anachronistic in that &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; premiered in 1879, &quot;after&quot; Leopold had already left his own time of 1876. The lead characters of the 2015 film &quot;Those People&quot; sing along to the song in duelling fashion. A nonsense pastiche of the song in the 2017 film &quot;Despicable Me 3&quot;, sung by Minions, was termed &quot;amusing&quot; and &quot;the film’s finest moment&quot;; it was uploaded to YouTube by Illumination Entertainment as a singalong challenge, which has garnered more than 19 million views as of 2023.

===Television references===
The song, or parts of it, has been sung in numerous television programs. For example, &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; (season 3, episode 52) staged a duet of the song with guest host Gilda Radner and a talking carrot. Radner had requested a seven-foot-tall talking &quot;parrot&quot;, but Kermit had difficulty reading her handwriting. In a short cutaway from the 2012 &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Killer Queen&quot;, Peter plays the Major-General in a community theater production and mumbles all through the opening verse of the song. The 2003 VeggieTales cartoon episode &quot;The Wonderful World of Auto-Tainment!&quot; features Archibald Asparagus singing the first verse of the song. In Season 2, Episode 13 of USA Network series &quot;In Plain Sight&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It Ahn&quot;, WITSEC workers, Mary and Eleanor, sing along to the song while listening to it being played as hold music. In a Season 3 episode of &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, &quot;Room for Change&quot; (1994), Al Borland, believing that he is in a sound-proof booth, belts out the first stanza but is heard by everyone.

Other examples of television renditions of the song include the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; episode &quot;Atonement&quot;, sung by Marcus Cole to irritate fellow passenger Dr. Franklin; &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; episode &quot;A Producer&#x27;s Lot&quot; (Series 3, Episode 11) sung by Mole (Richard Pearson); the &quot;Married... with Children&quot; episode &quot;Peggy and the Pirates&quot; (Season 7, Episode 18); the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Disaster&quot; and the &quot;Star Trek: Short Treks&quot; episode &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;; two episodes of &quot;Frasier&quot;, including &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot;, where Martin joins in the song, singing, &quot;With many awful facts about the scary hippopotamus!&quot;; the &quot;Mad About You&quot; episode &quot;Moody Blues&quot; (Season 6, Episode 5); and the &quot;Deep Space Homer&quot; episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Sometimes the song is used in an audition situation. For example, in the &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; episode &quot;And the Plot Moistens&quot; (Season 3, Episode 21), Alan sings the first verse of the song to persuade Jake to join the school musical. Similarly, in season 2 of &quot;Slings &amp; Arrows&quot;, Richard Smith-Jones uses the song to audition for the festival&#x27;s musical. In the pilot episode of &quot;90210&quot;, Annie Wilson sings the beginning of the song in a flash back of her old school performance. In the first episode of the 2020 British miniseries &quot;Quiz&quot;, about the Charles Ingram cheating scandal, Ingram and another Army officer sing the Major-General&#x27;s Song.

Parodies or pastiches of the song have been sung in a number of television programs. For example, the animated series &quot;ReBoot&quot; ended the series (Episode 39: &quot;End Prog&quot;) with a recap of the entire show&#x27;s plot, set to the song&#x27;s tune. The &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot; episode &quot;The Cold Open&quot; (2006), the cast of &quot;Studio 60&quot; opens with a parody: &quot;We&#x27;ll be the very model of a modern network TV show; we hope that you don&#x27;t mind that our producer was caught doing blow&quot;. In &quot;Doctor Who and the Pirates&quot;, the Doctor (played by Colin Baker) sings, &quot;I am the very model of a Gallifreyan buccaneer&quot;. Other songs, from &quot;Pirates&quot;, &quot;Pinafore&quot; and &quot;Ruddigore&quot;, are parodied. When he hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, David Hyde Pierce&#x27;s monologue was a parody of the song. In the &quot;Animaniacs&quot; short &quot;H.M.S. Yakko&quot;, Yakko sings &quot;I Am the Very Model of a Cartoon Individual&quot;. In the &quot;Scrubs&quot; episode &quot;My Musical&quot;, the song is parodied in &quot;The Rant Song&quot; sung by Dr. Cox. In a 2011 GEICO commercial, a couple that wants to save money, but still listen to musicals, finds a roommate, dressed as the Major-General, who awkwardly begins the song while dancing on a coffee table.

===Other parodies and pastiches===
The song has been widely parodied and pastiched, including by Tom Lehrer&#x27;s &quot;Elements Song&quot;, &quot;The Unix Sysadmin Song&quot;, written for the book &quot;The Unix Companion&quot; by Harley Hahn, which replaces the military references with Unix trivia, and &quot;Every Major&#x27;s Terrible&quot;, featured in comic No. 1052 on the webcomic &quot;xkcd&quot; in 2012. This comic then became the subject of numerous musical adaptations. &quot;The Elements&quot; inspired the &quot;Boy Scout Merit Badge Song&quot;, listing all the merit badges that can be earned from the Boy Scouts of America. In the video games &quot;Mass Effect 2&quot; and &quot;Mass Effect 3&quot;, the character Dr. Mordin Solus sings a short pastiche version (&quot;I Am the Very Model of a Scientist Salarian&quot;).

On the last night of The Proms in 2000, the outgoing conductor, Sir Andrew Davis, sang a pastiche of the song celebrating the festival. When Derek Pattinson retired as Secretary-General of the General Synod of the Church of England in 1990, a choir sang a variation on the Major-General&#x27;s Song, with the line &quot;He was the very model of a Secretary-General&quot;, in a meeting of the General Synod. In 2010, a parody version of the song was posted as an op-ed piece in the &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; mocking actions of the Attorney General of Virginia, Ken Cuccinelli. In 2010, Ron Butler released a YouTube video pastiche of the song, in character as President Obama, that received more than 1.8 million views. A 2015 YouTube parody satirizing county clerk Kim Davis called &quot;The Modern Fundamentalist&quot; was distributed by media outlets.

The character George Washington, in the song &quot;Right Hand Man&quot; from the 2015 musical &quot;Hamilton&quot; by Lin-Manuel Miranda, refers to himself with irony as &quot;The model of a modern major-general&quot;, which he rhymes with &quot;men are all&quot; and &quot;pedestal&quot;. Miranda commented: &quot;I always felt like &#x27;mineral&#x27; wasn&#x27;t the best possible rhyme.&quot; Stephen Colbert opined that some verses of &quot;Favorite Song&quot; by rap artist Chance the Rapper (featuring Childish Gambino), utilize the same rhythm as the Major-General&#x27;s Song. Randy Rainbow released a parody of the song in 2018 titled &quot;A Very Stable Genius&quot;, which lampoons Donald Trump.

<text>RELX plc (pronounced &quot;Rel-ex&quot;) is a British multinational information and analytics company headquartered in London, England. Its businesses provide scientific, technical and medical information and analytics; legal information and analytics; decision-making tools; and organise exhibitions. It operates in 40 countries and serves customers in over 180 nations. It was previously known as Reed Elsevier, and came into being in 1993 as a result of the merger of Reed International, a British trade book and magazine publisher, and Elsevier, a Netherlands-based scientific publisher.

The company is publicly listed, with shares traded on the London Stock Exchange, Amsterdam Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange (ticker symbols: London: REL, Amsterdam: REN, New York: RELX). The company is one of the constituents of the FTSE 100 Index, AEX Index, Financial Times Global 500 and Euronext 100 Index.

==History==
The company, which was previously known as Reed Elsevier, came into being in 1993, as a result of the merger of Reed International, a British trade book and magazine publisher, and Elsevier, a Netherlands-based scientific publisher. The company re-branded itself as RELX in February 2015.

===Reed International===
In 1895, Albert E. Reed established a newsprint manufacturing operation at Tovil Mill near Maidstone, Kent. The Reed family were Methodists and encouraged good working conditions for their staff in the then-dangerous print trade.

In 1965, Reed Group, as it was then known, became a conglomerate, creating its Decorative Products Division with the purchase of Crown Paints, Polycell and Sanderson&#x27;s wallpaper and DIY decorating interests.

In 1970, Reed Group merged with the International Publishing Corporation and the company name was changed to Reed International Limited. The company continued to grow by merging with other publishers and produced high quality trade journals as IPC Business Press Ltd and women&#x27;s and other consumer magazines as IPC magazines Ltd. Reed entered the United States in 1977 by acquiring Cahners Publications, founded by Norman Cahners.

In 1985, the company decided to rationalise its operations, focusing on publishing and selling off its other interests. Sanderson was sold to WestPoint Pepperell, Inc. of Georgia, United States, that year, while Crown Paint and Polycell were sold to Williams Holdings in 1987. The company&#x27;s paper and packaging production operations were bundled together to form Reedpack and sold to private equity firm Cinven in 1988. Reed expanded its publishing by acquiring Technical Publishing from Dun &amp; Bradstreet.
===Elsevier NV===
In 1880, Jacobus George Robbers started a publishing company called NV Uitgeversmaatschappij Elsevier (Elsevier Publishing Company NV) to publish literary classics and the encyclopedia &quot;Winkler Prins&quot;. Robbers named the company after the old Dutch printers family Elzevir, which, for example, published the works of Erasmus in 1587. Elsevier NV originally was based in Rotterdam but moved to Amsterdam in the late 1880s.

Up to the 1930s, Elsevier remained a small family-owned publisher, with no more than ten employees. After the war it launched the weekly &quot;Elsevier&quot; magazine, which turned out to be very profitable. A rapid expansion followed. Elsevier Press Inc. started in 1951 in Houston, Texas, USA, and in 1962 publishing offices were opened in London and New York. Multiple mergers in the 1970s led to name changes, settling at &quot;Elsevier Scientific Publishers&quot; in 1979. In 1991, two years before the merger with Reed, Elsevier acquired Pergamon Press in the UK.

===Cahners Publishing===
Cahners Publishing, founded by Norman Cahners, was the largest U.S. publisher of trade or business magazines as of his death in 1986. Reed International acquired the company in 1977.

=== Reed Elsevier and RELX ===

==== Significant acquisitions ====
==== Significant divestments ====
In February 1997, Reed Elsevier divested its trade publishing group (including Heinemann, Methuen, Secker &amp; Warburg, Sinclair-Stevenson, Mandarin, Minerva and Cedar) to Random House. In 1998, Reed Elsevier sold the children&#x27;s divisions of Heinemann, Methuen, Hamlyn and Mammoth to the Egmont Group.

In February 2007, the company announced its intention to sell Harcourt, its educational publishing division. On 4 May 2007 Pearson, the international education and information company, announced that it had agreed to acquire Harcourt Assessment and Harcourt Education International from Reed Elsevier for $950m in cash. In July 2007, Reed Elsevier announced its agreement to sell the remaining Harcourt Education business, including international imprint Heinemann, to Houghton Mifflin for $4 billion in cash and stock.

Between 2006 and 2019, in 65 separate deals, the company systematically sold its 300 print, business to business magazine titles, reducing the proportion of print revenues from 51% to 9%. Advertising, which had been the largest source of revenues when RELX was founded, represented just 1% of sales in 2018.

In July 2009, Reed Elsevier announced its intention to sell most of its North American trade publications, including &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, &quot;Broadcasting &amp; Cable&quot;, and &quot;Multichannel News&quot;, although it planned to retain &quot;Variety&quot;.

In April 2010, Reed Elsevier announced that it had sold 21 US magazines to other owners in recent months, and that an additional 23 US trade magazines, including &quot;Restaurants &amp; Institutions&quot;, &quot;Hotels&quot;, and &quot;Trade Show Week&quot; would cease publication. The closures were mostly due to the weak economy including an advertising slump.

&quot;Variety&quot;, the company&#x27;s last remaining North American title, was sold in October 2012.

In 2014, Reed Business Information sold BuyerZone, an online marketplace; emedia, an American provider of research for IT buyers and vendors; and a majority stake in Reed Construction Data, a provider of construction data.

In 2016, RELX sold &quot;Elsevier Weekly&quot; and &quot;BeleggersBelangen&quot; in the Netherlands.

In 2017, the company sold &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine.

In January 2019, RBI sold its Dutch agricultural media and selected international agricultural media portfolio (including &quot;Poultry World)&quot; to Doorakkeren BV.

In August 2019, &quot;Flight International&quot; and &quot;FlightGlobal&quot; were sold to DVV Media Group.

In December 2019, RBI announced plans to sell the &quot;Farmers Weekly&quot; magazine title, website and related platforms, events and awards to MA Agriculture Limited, part of the Mark Allen Group.

In May 2024, RX sold the Gamer Network to IGN Entertainment, division of Ziff Davis. However, it retained the EGX convention and &quot;Popverse&quot;.

The LexisNexis legal and news database contains 119 billion documents and records.

==Corporate affairs==
===Corporate strategy===
From 2011 to 2014, the average annual value of acquisitions was about $300m. The predictability of the company&#x27;s results in recent years has led to a re-rating of the shares.

===Financial performance===
===Social responsibility===
The RELX Environmental Challenge awards grants to projects advancing access to safe water and sanitation.

In 2019, Mike Walsh, CEO of LexisNexis, was honoured by the UN Foundation with a Global Leadership award for the company&#x27;s work in advancing the Rule of Law - recognizing the company&#x27;s commitment to strengthening equality under law, transparency of law, independent judiciaries and accessible legal remedy.

The Elsevier Foundation supports libraries in developing countries, women scientists and nursing facilities. In 2016 it committed $1m a year, for 3 years, to programmes encouraging diversity in science, technology and medicine and promoting science research in developing countries.

Programmes operated by LexisNexis Legal &amp; Professional include:
* With the Atlantic Council, launching the first draft of the &quot;Global Rule of Law Business Principles&quot; which will help businesses, law firms and NGOs promote and uphold the rule of law.
* With the International Bar Association, launching an application called &quot;eyeWitness to Atrocities&quot;, designed to capture GPS coordinates, date and time stamps, sensory and movement data, and the location of nearby objects such as Wi-Fi networks.

* The &quot;ADAM&quot; (Automated Delivery of Alerts on Missing Children) programme in the US, developed by employees in 2000, which assists in the recovery of missing children through a system of targeted alerts. the programme has helped trace 177 missing children.
* &quot;Social Media Monitor&quot;, which assists law enforcement officials in investigating serious crimes such as drug dealing and human trafficking.

==Controversy==
=== Mercury contamination in Grassy Narrows ===
The mercury contamination of the Wabigoon River in Ontario Canada by a corporate subsidiary between 1962 and 1970 was &quot;one of the worst cases of environmental poisoning in Canadian history.&quot; Reed sold the Dryden Mill to Great Lakes Forest Products in 1980. As of 2017, Grassy Narrows First Nation chief Simon Fobister stated that the river remained highly contaminated.

===Academic journal prices===
Reed Elsevier has been criticised for the high prices of its journals and services, especially those published by Elsevier. It has also supported SOPA, PIPA and the Research Works Act, although it no longer supports the last. Because of this, members of the scientific community have boycotted Elsevier journals. In January 2012, the boycott gained an online pledge and petition (The Cost of Knowledge) initiated by mathematician and Fields medalist Sir Timothy Gowers. The movement has received support from noted science bloggers, such as biologist Jonathan Eisen. Between 2012 and February 2023, about 20,500 scientists signed The Cost of Knowledge boycott.

===2019 UC system negotiations ===
On 28 February 2019, following long negotiations, the University of California announced it would be terminating all subscriptions with Elsevier. On 16 March 2021, following further negotiations and significant changes including (i) universal open access to University of California research and (ii) containing the &quot;excessively high costs&quot; being charged by publishers, the university renewed its subscription.

===Privacy===
As a data broker Reed Elsevier collected, used, and sold data on millions of consumers. In 2005, a security breach occurred through a recently purchased subsidiary, Seisint, which allowed identity thieves to steal the records of at least 316,000 people. The database contained names, current and prior addresses, dates of birth, drivers license numbers and Social Security numbers, among other data obtained from credit reporting agencies and other sources. In 2008 the company settled an action taken against it by the Federal Trade Commission for multiple failures of security practice in how the data was stored and protected. The settlement required Reed Elsevier and Seisint to establish and maintain a comprehensive security program to protect nonpublic personal information.

===Defence exhibitions===
Between 2005 and 2007, members of the medical and scientific communities, which purchase and use many journals published by Reed Elsevier, agitated for the company to cut its links to the arms trade. Two UK academics, Tom Stafford of Sheffield University and Nick Gill, launched petitions calling for it to stop organising arms fairs. A subsidiary, Spearhead, organised defence shows, including an event where it was reported that cluster bombs and extremely powerful riot control equipment were offered for sale. In February 2007 Richard Smith, former editor of the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, published an editorial in the &quot;Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine&quot; arguing that Reed Elsevier&#x27;s involvement in both the arms trade and medical publishing constituted a conflict of interest. Subsequently, in June the company announced that they would be exiting the defence exhibition business during the second half of the year.

===Collaboration with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)===
In November 2019, legal scholars and human rights activists called on RELX to cease work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement because their product LexisNexis directly contributes to the deportation of illegal immigrants.

===Support for fossil fuel expansion===
An article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in February 2022 revealed that Elsevier products and services support expanding the production aims of the fossil fuel industry. The company disclosed that it is &quot;not prepared to draw a line between the transition away from fossil fuels and the expansion of oil and gas extraction.&quot; In response, the Union of Concerned Scientists and Scientists for Global Responsibility launched a petition in 2022, and issued a response to the company&#x27;s reply in 2023. UCS noted in a blog post that &quot;Elsevier and RELX claimed to be focused on a transition to clean energy. Given the services Elsevier and RELX continue to provide, these claims are demonstrably false.&quot; Scientists for Global Responsibility also noted on their website that the company&#x27;s &quot;actions fall short of meeting the standards set in their own pledges&quot; and pointed campaigners to the website of Climate Rights Coalition, which revealed such concerns had been raised by employees years prior.

<text>Continuous optimization is a branch of optimization in applied mathematics.

As opposed to discrete optimization, the variables used in the objective function are required to be continuous variables—that is, to be chosen from a set of real values between which there are no gaps (values from intervals of the real line). Because of this continuity assumption, continuous optimization allows the use of calculus techniques.

<text>Melissopalynology is the study of pollen contained in honey and, in particular, the pollen&#x27;s source. By studying the pollen in a sample of honey, it is possible to gain evidence of the geographical location and genus of the plants that the honey bees visited, although honey may also contain airborne pollens from anemophilous plants, spores, and dust due to attraction by the electrostatic charge of bees.

In general, melissopalynology is used to combat fraud and inaccurate labelling of honey. Information gained from the study of a given sample of honey (and pollen) is useful when substantiating claims of a particular source for the sample. Monofloral honey derived from one particular source plant may be more valuable than honey derived from many types of plants. The price of honey also varies according to the region from which it originates.

<text>HMS &quot;Centaur&quot; was the first of the four light fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. She was the only ship of her class to be completed with the original design configuration of a straight axial flight deck, rather than the newly invented angled flight decks of her three later sister ships. She was laid down in 1944 in Belfast, with the contract being awarded to Harland and Wolff, but not launched until 22 April 1947 due to delays relating to the end of the war. She was commissioned on 1 September 1953, almost nine years from when she was laid down in 1944.

&quot;Centaur&quot; saw service throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. Due to budgetary issues &quot;Centaur&quot; was not converted to a commando carrier like two of her sister ships. &quot;Centaur&quot; was withdrawn from service in August 1965 and sold for scrapping in 1972.

==Completion==

&quot;Centaur&quot; was completed with an axial flight deck, marked by a broken white line running down the middle of the entire length of the flight deck. She began her contractor&#x27;s sea trials in March 1953 and commissioned on 17 September 1953. Her aviation facilities as completed included 2 x BH5 hydraulic catapults at the bow, six arrestor wires, two capacity aircraft lifts, measuring forward and aft. Her single hangar measured , and she had stowage for of AVCAT and Avgas aviation fuel.

Following the completion of her sea and machinery trials in October 1953 she was taken in hand at Portsmouth Dockyard, to be fitted with an interim 5.5-degree angled deck, which was already being added to her as yet uncompleted sister ships, and . This required cutting down the port sheerstrake, re-siting the walkways and removing three twin Bofors guns and their directors. Upon completion of this work in April 1954 she was finally able to join the fleet as the first angled-deck carrier in the Royal Navy and undertook her initial flying trials in the English Channel from May to July 1954.

==Operational history==

===First commission===


&quot;Centaur&quot;″s initial air group of 25 aircraft, as embarked in July 1954, consisted of nine Hawker Sea Hawk FGA6 of 806 Squadron, nine Hawker Sea Fury FB11 of 810 Squadron, six Grumman Avenger AS anti-submarine aircraft of 820 Squadron and one Westland Dragonfly HR5 of the ship&#x27;s flight. &quot;Centaur&quot; was initially intended to join the Mediterranean Fleet for a period of four months, before heading east of Suez to relieve as the duty carrier in the Far East. As events transpired however, she was to remain in the Mediterranean until June 1955. Her activities during this period included exercises in company with her sister ship &quot;Albion&quot; and NATO allies, embarking British troops during the withdrawal from Trieste in October 1954, escorting the royal yacht during a Royal Tour and numerous visits to friendly ports. Whilst at Malta in February 1955 the Sea Furys of 810 Squadron were disembarked and the squadron later flew back to the UK to be disbanded; they were replaced by nine Sea Hawks of 803 Squadron which were transferred from &quot;Albion&quot; in March 1955. The Avenger AS4s of 820 Squadron were similarly replaced by six Avenger AS5s of 814 Squadron.

From June 1955 until January 1956 &quot;Centaur&quot; was based in home waters and undertook a range of visits and exercises with other carriers of the fleet. After two months spent in Portsmouth from November 1955 she left for the Far East on 10 January 1956, in company with &quot;Albion&quot;. Further changes to her air-group saw the Avengers of 814 Squadron replaced by the re-formed 820 Squadron, with six Fairey Gannet AS4s. After passing through the Suez Canal she visited Aden in February to undertake flying exercises with RAF Venoms based at RAF Khormaksar. This was followed by a visit to India, where the two carriers provided flying demonstrations for the Indian government, who were at that time interested in acquiring an aircraft carrier for the Indian Navy. This eventually resulted in the purchase, the following year, of the incomplete , completed in 1961 to an updated design as . Further exercises were carried out in the Indian Ocean, before heading east to visit Hong Kong and Singapore. She crossed the line for the first time on 26 April &quot;en route&quot; back from Singapore to Devonport via Suez and Malta, arriving on 15 May 1956.

===Modernisation===

In the mid-1950s Government Defence Policy was to maintain a fleet of four active aircraft carriers to meet both NATO and Imperial commitments. In practice this meant a total fleet of five to six ships, allowing for refits, modernisation and training. The rapid advances in naval aviation technology during this period, such as the angled deck, steam catapults and mirror landing sight, coupled with the planned introduction of the new, heavier second-generation jet fighters such as the Supermarine Scimitar and De Havilland Sea Vixen, rendered the existing carrier fleet obsolescent. Only (completed in 1955), the rebuilt , and under-construction , due to join the fleet in 1958 and 1959 respectively, had the capability to operate the new aircraft. Thus it was decided to rebuild from 1959 to 1964 to the same standard as &quot;Victorious&quot; and &quot;Hermes&quot;, followed by a similar upgrade to &quot;Ark Royal&quot;. This left a potential period of five years between 1959 and 1964 when a maximum of three carriers would be available. The Admiralty therefore searched for an interim solution to bridge this feared gap.

The design limitations of the three &quot;Centaur&quot;-class carriers completed in 1953-4 meant that a rebuild to the standard adopted for the other carriers would be difficult, if not impossible. A particular problem was the lack of hangar deck strength, which when the ships were ordered in 1943, was specified to handle aircraft. A fully loaded Sea Vixen FAW1 could weigh up to and the Scimitar up to . This would mean that in operation these aircraft would have to be armed and fuelled on the flight deck. Nonetheless, no other hulls were available, and given the potential &quot;gap&quot;, a quick solution was needed. It was therefore decided that one &quot;Centaur&quot;-class would be given a limited modernisation, to give her the minimum capability to operate these aircraft. &quot;Centaur&quot; herself was selected for this purpose in May 1956.

Between June 1956 and August 1958 &quot;Centaur&quot; underwent her partial modernisation at Devonport Dockyard. This involved the installation of two BS4 steam catapults forward, the removal of the Bofors guns on the flight deck, improved air operations facilities and the addition of a Type 963 blind-landing radome at the rear of the island. Some work was also done on a further slight extension on the port side, to enable a six-degree angled flight deck to be used. Her arrestor cables were not upgraded at this stage, however. This was rectified in her 1960–1961 refit, when five arrestor wires were fitted.

===Second commission===

&quot;Centaur&quot; recommissioned at Devonport on 3 September 1958, under the command of Captain Horace Law. Following the completion of post-refit ship trials in the Channel and South-West Approaches in November, she embarked her air group in preparation for her flying trials, which included visits from both Sea Vixens and Scimitars as well as two Gannet AEW3s. In January 1959 she embarked her full air-group, consisting of fourteen Hawker Sea Hawk FGA6s of 801 Squadron, eight Sea Venom FAW22s of 891 Squadron, eight Westland Whirlwind HS7s of 845 Squadron and four Douglas Skyraider AEW1s of D Flight 849 Squadron.

From January to March she operated with the Mediterranean Fleet based in Malta, before proceeding to the North Atlantic to take part in Exercise Dawn Breeze IV, in company with &quot;Eagle&quot; and the recently rebuilt and re-commissioned &quot;Victorious&quot;. During March the Whirlwind helicopters of 845 Squadron were landed due to technical problems with their engines and she re-embarked Dragonflies to carry out search And rescue duties. Six Gannet AS4s of 810 NAS were also embarked from June 1959, to provide anti-submarine capability.

In April 1959 &quot;Centaur&quot; was used during the making of the film &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; to depict flight operations from both Royal Navy aircraft carriers &quot;Victorious&quot; and ; (her post-war pennant number R06 is clear in both scenes). Three surviving Fairey Swordfish biplanes were restored and flown from her decks, and scenes were also shot on the bridge of the carrier, and in the aircrew briefing room. One of the Swordfish was piloted by the test pilot Peter Twiss.

After her brief spell in the limelight, &quot;Centaur&quot; spent a few weeks in home waters, carrying out flying operations, and paid visits to Copenhagen, Denmark and Brest, France, before departing for the Mediterranean via Lisbon and Gibraltar. Whilst at Gibraltar further changes to her air-group were made as the Skyraiders of 849D Squadron were disembarked, whilst the Gannets of 810 Squadron rejoined the ship. Following a transit through the Suez Canal in late June she operated in the Indian Ocean with visits to Kuwait, Aden and Trincomalee, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where she was visited by the prime minister, Solomon Bandaranaike, shortly before his assassination in September 1959. After a month-long maintenance period in Singapore, she operated in Pacific waters for the next three and a half months, including joint exercises with off the Philippines and a visit to Australia, before returning to Singapore. Further operations in the Indian Ocean, including a visit to East Africa, followed before she left to return home, being replaced as the east of Suez carrier by &quot;Albion&quot;. She arrived back at Devonport on 26 April, having steamed and carried out 7,805 catapult launches, for the loss of one Sea Hawk, two Sea Venoms and a Dragonfly helicopter of the ship&#x27;s flight.

===Third commission===

&quot;Centaur&quot; was refitted at Portsmouth from September 1960 until March 1961, during which the upgraded arrestor wires were fitted and additional air-conditioning units installed. Following sea-trials off Portland in March, she embarked her new air group during April, consisting of between six and eight Scimitar F1 of 807 Squadron, between six and nine Sea Vixen FAW1 of 893 Squadron, four Fairey Gannet AEW3 of 849 Squadron, A Flight, and eight Whirlwind HAS7 of 824 Squadron.

During April she sailed for the Mediterranean to continue flying exercises with her new air-group and met &quot;Hermes&quot; for the first time at Gibraltar. Although she was originally scheduled to cross the North Atlantic for a visit to the US and Canada, events in the Middle East were to lead to a rapid change of plans.

In June 1961 President Abd al-Karim Qasim of Iraq announced that Kuwait would be annexed by Iraq; the Emir of Kuwait requested assistance from the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia. The UK activated Operation Vantage and immediately sent &quot;Victorious&quot; and accompanying vessels. landed a company of 42 Commando, Royal Marines at Kuwait airport. &quot;Centaur&quot; arrived from Malta in July to relieve &quot;Victorious&quot; on patrol in the Gulf. Iraq recognised Kuwaiti sovereignty in 1963, after Kassim had been killed in a coup.

With a reduction in tension following the decisive action of the Royal Navy to deter the would-be aggressor, &quot;Centaur&quot; was ordered to return to station off Aden, and subsequently returned home to Devonport in September, for a six-week maintenance period. During October she re-embarked her air-group and headed back through the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean, to once again relieve &quot;Victorious&quot; as the duty carrier East of Suez in December. This duty saw visits to Mombasa (Kenya), Aden, Singapore and Hong Kong. In early December she was engaged in flood relief work in Kenya, where the Tana River had burst its banks. Her Whirlwinds helped to ferry essential supplies to the cut-off areas and temporary camps. There was also a brief return to the Gulf in December 1961 when President Kassim of Iraq resumed threats against Kuwait, before backing down again. &quot;Centaur&quot; was relieved as the duty carrier by &quot;Ark Royal&quot; at the end of March and began her journey home.

During May 1962 her air group was disembarked as she entered a short maintenance period in Portsmouth Dockyard. 807 squadron was disbanded at this time, following a decision to phase out the Scimitar in favour of the Blackburn Buccaneer. &quot;Centaur&quot; lacked the capacity to operate the Buccaneer; however, the removal of the Scimitar Squadron did enable her to operate an enlarged squadron of twelve Sea Vixens instead.

On 18 June 1962 a new commanding officer, Captain Philip G Sharp, took over the ship, before she sailed to take part in exercises in the North Sea, following which she departed for Gibraltar. The rest of the summer was spent in the Mediterranean, including a three-week refit in Gibraltar, before she returned to home waters in October. On 19 November, whilst exercising in the Irish Sea, there was a sudden loss of pressure in &quot;A&quot; Boiler Room, which in turn led to a loss of power on the port engine and tripped lighting and radar circuits. This was caused by the burst of a main steam-pipe in the boiler room and superheated steam at and at a pressure of up to escaping and killing, instantly, the five crew members on duty at the time in the boiler room. Engineering staff isolated the affected boiler, and later that morning a rescue team wearing asbestos suits were able to recover the bodies of their ship-mates. Later that day their coffins, wrapped in Union Jacks, were flown off to RAF Valley, and a memorial service was held. Centaur returned to Portsmouth on 27 November for repairs that lasted until 22 January.

After working up with her air-group in the Channel, during which a Sea Vixen of 893 Squadron was lost with her crew, &quot;Centaur&quot; took part in further emergency relief work, this time at home, carrying supplies for isolated communities in Wales and Northern Ireland, cut off by the severe blizzards of the Winter of 1963. On 13 February 1963 she was ordered to proceed east of Suez to provide cover for , which had been detailed to provide support for forces loyal to the Sultan of Brunei, following the Indonesian backed revolt, thus starting what became known as the Indonesian confrontation. She passed through the Suez Canal on 1 March and spent the next two months in the Indian Ocean, during a period of high tension following the February coup in Iraq, which had resulted in the removal of President Kassim. Centaur was finally ordered to return home, arriving in Portsmouth on 22 May.

There had been speculation during this period that &quot;Centaur&quot; would be converted to a Commando Carrier, similar to her sister-ships, as the MacMillan government had originally only planned to keep her in service until &quot;Eagle&quot; rejoined the fleet in 1963/64. However, the decision to keep 2 carriers available for service east of Suez meant that she would serve longer than originally intended in the fixed-wing role.

===Fourth commission===

&quot;Centaur&quot; was refitted in Portsmouth Dockyard between June and November 1963, during which she was fitted with a large Mirror Landing Sight on a sponson on the port-side of the flight deck and a Type 965 air search radar was installed on a lattice foremast (taken from the Air Direction Destroyer &quot;Battleaxe&quot;, which had been earmarked for disposal, after being badly damaged in a collision the previous year) at the front of her island. More air-conditioning units were also installed and further improvements were made to her Operations Room. Whilst alongside in Portsmouth in October she sustained slight damage to her bow, when the submarine HMS Porpoise collided with her after being caught by the ebb tide.

She re-commissioned on 15 November 1963. Her final, twenty-two strong, air-group was embarked shortly afterwards, consisting of twelve Sea Vixen FAW1 of 892 Squadron, four Gannet AEW3 of 849 Squadron, A Flight, and the ships flight of one Whirlwind. She also occasionally embarked small detachments of Scimitars seconded from other squadrons. She was destined to be sent to the Far East, however before departing she undertook an emergency mission from 23 to 24 December, to assist the Greek cruise liner &quot;TSMS Lakonia&quot;, which had caught fire near Madeira. Centaur&#x27;s helicopter helped to recover the victims of the tragedy, which claimed the lives of 128 passengers and crew; their bodies were disembarked on the ships lighter at Gibraltar on Christmas Day 1963 .

After a quick passage through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal, she arrived off Aden in January to continue her work-up, during which time she embarked the six Wessex helicopters of 815 Squadron from RAF Khormaksar to complete her air-group. She was also engaged in providing air support for Operations Damon and Nutcracker, an attempt to put down a rebellion in the Radfan region of Aden.

In January 1964 a mutiny occurred in Tanganyika. The 1st Tanganyika Rifles, who were based near the capital Dar-es-Salaam, had mutinied against their British officers, as well as seizing the British High Commissioner and taking over the airport. Britain decided, after urgent appeals for help from President Julius Nyerere, to deploy &quot;Centaur&quot; accompanied by 815 Naval Air Squadron along with 45 Commando of the Royal Marines. When &quot;Centaur&quot; arrived at Dar-es-Salaam, a company of Royal Marines was landed by helicopter on a football field next to the barracks of the mutineers. The company assaulted the barracks with full force in a chaotic but swift attack. After a call for the mutinous soldiers to surrender failed, the company demolished the front of the guardroom with a shot from an anti-tank rocket launcher, which resulted in a large number of distressed soldiers pouring out into the open. Later, four Sea Vixens from &quot;Centaur&quot; provided cover for more Royal Marines, who were landed on an air strip. The operation was a success and the rest of the mutineers surrendered, with the main culprits being arrested. Many Tanganyikans were jubilant when the country was restored to a stable and peaceful condition. The Royal Marine Band displayed the British forces appreciation of the friendly welcome they had received from the Tanganyikans while restoring the country to stability, by taking part in a heavy schedule of parades through the streets of Tanganyika. &quot;Centaur&quot; left on 29 January, nine days after originally sailing for what was then a country in crisis.

&quot;Centaur&quot; completed her work-up during February in the South China Sea. and spent the next three months in the region, which included a high-profile visit to Singapore to deter threatened Indonesian aggression against Singapore and the newly formed Malaysian Federation. During May &quot;Centaur&quot; was ordered to return to the Indian Ocean to provide further support in Aden, where the Radfan rebellion was escalating into a major conflict. Her Wessex helicopters were used to replace RAF Belvedere&#x27;s suffering from engine failures.

During the summer her Sea Vixens undertook air strikes against the rebel forces in Radfan, helping to bring the campaign to a successful conclusion. Whilst exercising off Penang on 11 July, one of her Sea Vixen&#x27;s and its crew were lost. A Gannet sent to search for the missing fighter was also lost although its crew were rescued. From 26 July she participated in exercise FOTEX 64 with other units of the fleet in the South China Seas, later joining with the Royal Australian Navy aircraft carrier, HMAS Melbourne in Exercise Stopwatch during August. During September she became directly involved in what became known as the Indonesian Confrontation, when Indonesian troops were parachuted near the town of Labis, and sea-landings were made on the west coast of the Malayan peninsula. The invaders were quickly captured, however &quot;Centaur&quot; took station to prevent any further incursions in that area. She remained in the far-east until 25 November when she began the journey home for Christmas.

During a refit that lasted until March 1965 it was announced that &quot;Centaur&quot; would be withdrawn from service later that year, the first of the Royal Navy&#x27;s modern carrier fleet to be withdrawn. A deployment to the Mediterranean during April, May and June included a number of high-profile port visits and exercises with the fleet, as well as close encounters with the Soviet Black Sea Fleet. She returned to the UK during July and undertook a series of farewell visits to various ports and participated in a Royal Review of the Home Fleet in the Clyde during August. She returned to Portsmouth on 24 August 1965 and was open for visits by the public during Navy Days, before paying off for the last time on 27 September 1965.

===Final years===

Pressures on the Defence Budget meant that there was no money available to further modernise &quot;Centaur&quot; nor convert her to a Commando Carrier; such funds and resources as might have been available, were already committed to converting the Tiger Class Cruisers to become rudimentary Helicopter Carriers. Her use to the Navy was not quite over however, as she was consigned to the role of an accommodation ship for the crew of &quot;Victorious&quot; while the latter ship undertook a refit. In 1966, &quot;Centaur&quot; was towed to Devonport and was again used as an accommodation ship, this time for the aircraft carrier , while that ship was also refitted. In 1967 she was used as a tender for the RN Barracks, HMS Drake at Devonport, and was towed back to Portsmouth later that year, to act as an accommodation ship for &quot;Hermes&quot; during the latter ships&#x27; refit. In 1970, she was towed to Devonport, where after another spell as an accommodation ship, and with her condition now deteriorating significantly, she was put on the disposal list. She was sold on 11 August 1972 to Queenborough Shipbreaking Company, and shortly afterwards she was towed to Cairnryan and broken up.

<doc id="420582" wikidata="Q28185" url="?curid=420582" title="Föhr North Frisian">
<text>Föhr Frisian, or Fering, is the dialect of North Frisian spoken on the island of Föhr in the German region of North Frisia. &quot;Fering&quot; refers to the &quot;Fering&quot; Frisian name of Föhr, &quot;Feer&quot;. Together with the Öömrang, Söl&#x27;ring, and Heligolandic dialects, it forms part of the insular group of North Frisian dialects and it is very similar to Öömrang.

==Status==
Around 3,000 of Föhr&#x27;s 8,700 people speak &quot;Fering&quot; (1,500 of them being native speakers), constituting a third of all North Frisian speakers. Fering differs from other North Frisian dialects in that it is also used publicly on Föhr, not only at home. The municipalities of Oldsum and Süderende (Fering: Olersem, Söleraanj) in the western part of Föhr are strongholds of the dialect.

==Personal and family names==
Personal names on Föhr are still today greatly influenced by a Frisian element. Notably hypocorisms and names with two elements are common. Early borrowings were made from the Danish language and the Christianisation of the North Frisians around 1000 A.D. brought a modest influence of Christian and biblical names. In the Age of Sail, Dutch and West Frisian forms became popular.

Family names were usually patronymic, i. e. they were individually created as genitives from the father&#x27;s given name. Contrary to the Scandinavian &quot;Petersen&quot; or &quot;Petersson&quot;, meaning &quot;Peter&#x27;s son&quot;, a Fering name like &quot;Peters&quot; means &quot;of Peter&quot;. This practice was prohibited by the Danish Crown in 1771 for the Duchy of Schleswig and was therefore abandoned in the eastern part of Föhr. As western Föhr was a direct part of the Danish kingdom until 1864, patronyms were in use there until 1828 when they were forbidden in Denmark proper as well.

==Loanwords==
Apart from Dutch names, the seafarers in Dutch service also introduced many loanwords in Dutch language to Fering which are still in use today. It has been observed that apart from Afrikaans, no other language outside the Netherlands proper has been influenced as much by the Dutch language as the North Frisian insular dialects. Examples for Fering include:

Other loanwords were derived from American English when many people emigrated from Föhr to the United States but kept contact with their relatives on the island. Examples include:

==Phonology==
The &quot;r&quot; is always pronounced as alveolar trill. Initial &quot;s&quot; is always voiceless.

The diphthongs &quot;ia&quot;, &quot;ua&quot; and &quot;ui&quot; as well as the triphthong &quot;uai&quot; are falling diphthongs, i.e. the stress is always on the first vowel.

== Orthography ==
The current orthographic rules for Fering and Öömrang were defined in 1971. Previously, linguists like L. C. Peters, Otto Bremer and Reinhard Arfsten had each created their own Fering orthography. Long vowels including those with umlauts are always written as double letters while consonants are short by default. Capital letters are only used in the beginning of a sentence and for proper names.

Although there is a standard orthography, there is still spelling variation. This could partly be because many Fering speakers only learned how to spell standard German in school. For example, the North Frisian nationalist slogan &quot;lewer duad üs Slaw!&quot; (better dead than a slave) often appears along with the flag or crest of Föhr and has spelling variants including: &quot;leewer duad üüs Slaaw&quot;, &quot;lewer duaad üs Slaaw&quot;, and &quot;lewer duad üs Slav&quot;.

== Grammar ==

===Nouns===
====Gender====
Fering originally had 3 genders: masculine, feminine and neuter. However during the course of the twentieth century the feminine and neuter genders have combined.

====Number====
Fering nouns have two numbers – &quot;singular&quot; and &quot;plural&quot;. There are two major suffixes used to form the plural: &quot;-er&quot; and &quot;-en&quot;. Nouns with a masculine gender often use the &quot;-er&quot; plural (although there are a few feminine/neuter nouns in this group) and nouns with a feminine/neuter gender often use the &quot;-en&quot; plural (there are a few masculine nouns in this group). Plurals can also be formed using &quot;-in&quot;, &quot;-n&quot; and &quot;-s&quot;. There are also plurals formed by changing a consonant at the end of the word, by changing a vowel within the word or by retaining the same form as the singular. Occasionally the plural form is formed by using a different word.

* An example of a masculine noun using the &quot;-er&quot; plural suffix: (dog) – (dogs). Nouns can also lose an unstressed vowel, as is the case with (basket) – (baskets). Some nouns undergo a vowel change, such as (blacksmith) – (blacksmiths).

There are exceptions in this suffix group, including (window; a feminine/neuter noun) which forms the plural by removing a syllable – &#x27; (windows), and (island; also a feminine/neuter noun, and a German loanword) which form forms the plural by removing an unstressed vowel – (islands).

* An example of a feminine/neuter noun using the &quot;-en&quot; plural suffix: &quot;buk&quot; (book) – &quot;buken&quot; (books). Nouns can also lose an unstressed vowel, as is the case with (woman) – (women) and (village) – (villages).
* An example of a (feminine/neuter) noun using the &quot;-en&quot; plural suffix: (office – i.e., a type of position) – (offices).
* An example of a (masculine) noun using the &quot;-n&quot; plural suffix: (painter) – (painters).
* An example of a (masculine) noun using the &quot;-s&quot; plural suffix: (captain) – (captains).
* Examples of masculine nouns which retain the same form as the singular include: (stone(s)), &quot;karmen&quot; (man, men), &quot;lüs&quot; (louse, lice), (boot(s)) and (twin(s)).
* Examples of feminine/neuter nouns which retain the same form as the singular include: &quot;bian&quot; (bone(s), leg(s), &quot;gris&quot; (piglet(s)), &quot;schep&quot; (sheep, singular and plural) and &quot;swin&quot; (pig(s)).

<doc id="420584" wikidata="Q27534" url="?curid=420584" title="Mutoscope">
<text>The Mutoscope is an early motion picture device, invented by W. K. L. Dickson and Herman Casler and granted to Herman Casler on November 5, 1895. Like Thomas Edison&#x27;s Kinetoscope, it did not project on a screen and provided viewing to only one person at a time. Cheaper and simpler than the Kinetoscope, the system, marketed by the American Mutoscope Company (later the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company), quickly dominated the coin-in-the-slot peep-show business.

==Operation==
The Mutoscope works on the same principle as the flip book. The individual image frames are conventional black-and-white, silver-based photographic prints on tough, flexible opaque cards. The image on each card is made by contact printing each frame of the original 70 mm film. Rather than being bound into a booklet, the cards are attached to a circular core, similar to a huge Rolodex. A reel typically holds about 850 cards, giving a viewing time of about one minute. The reel with cards attached has a total diameter of about ; the individual cards have dimensions of about .

Mutoscopes are coin-operated. The patron views the cards through a single lens enclosed by a hood, similar to the viewing hood of a stereoscope. The cards are generally lit electrically, but the reel is driven by means of a geared-down hand crank. Each machine holds only a single reel and is dedicated to the presentation of a single short subject, described by a poster affixed to the machine.

The patron can control the presentation speed only to a limited degree. The crank can be turned in both directions, but this does not reverse the playing of the reel. The patron cannot extend viewing time by stopping the crank, because the flexible images are bent into the proper viewing position by tension applied from forward cranking. Stopping the crank reduces the forward tension on the reels causing the reel to go backward and the picture to move away from the viewing position. A spring in the mechanism turns off the light, and in some models closes a shutter which blocks the picture.

==Manufacture==
Mutoscopes were originally manufactured from 1895 to 1909 for the American Mutoscope Company, later American Mutoscope and Biograph Company (1899) by the Marvin &amp; Casler Co., Canastota, New York formed by two of the founding Managers of American Mutoscope Company. 

In the 1920s the Mutoscope was licensed to William Rabkin who started his own company, the International Mutoscope Reel Company, which manufactured new reels and also machines from 1926 until 1949. 

The term &quot;Mutoscope&quot; is no longer a registered trademark in the United States.

==Usage==
Mutoscopes were a popular feature of amusement arcades and pleasure piers in the UK until the introduction of decimal coinage in 1971. The coin mechanisms were difficult to convert, and many machines were subsequently destroyed. Some were exported to Denmark where pornography had recently been legalised. The typical arcade installation included multiple machines offering a mixture of fare. Both in the early days and during the revival, that mixture usually included &quot;girlie&quot; reels which ran the gamut from risqué to outright soft-core pornography. It was common for these reels to have suggestive titles that implied more than the reel actually delivered. The title of one such reel, &quot;What the Butler Saw&quot;, became a by-word, and Mutoscopes are commonly known in the UK as &quot;What-the-Butler-Saw machines.&quot; (What the butler saw, presumably through a keyhole, was a woman partially disrobing.)

==Public response==
&quot;The San Francisco Call&quot; printed a short piece about the Mutoscope in 1898, which claimed that the device was extremely popular: &quot;Twenty machines, all different and amusing views...are crowded day and night with sightseers.&quot; However, just a few months later, the same newspaper published an editorial railing against the Mutoscope and similar machines: &quot;...a new instrument has been placed in the hands of the vicious for the corruption of youth...These vicious exhibitions are displayed in San Francisco with an effrontery that is as audacious as it is shameless.&quot;

In 1899, &quot;The Times&quot; also printed a letter inveighing against &quot;vicious demoralising picture shows in the penny-in-the-slot machines. It is hardly possible to exaggerate the corruption of the young that comes from exhibiting under a strong light, nude female figures represented as living and moving, going into and out of baths, sitting as artists&#x27; models etc. Similar exhibitions took place at Rhyl in the men&#x27;s lavatory, but, owing to public denunciation, they have been stopped.&quot;

<text>The Breetles are an American power pop band, led by Chris Breetveld. They formed in Kendall Park, New Jersey around 1985, becoming one of the founding bands of the &quot;Kendall Park Sound&quot;. Another relatively important part of the KP Sound is Donald Fagen, who used to live in 7 Joline Rd. Chris&#x27; first band, The Statics (1965–66) rehearsed at 13 Joline Rd., and the Statics influence on Steely Dan is improbable.

The Breetles style has been described as primarily resembling that of The Who, The Beatles, and The Byrds, and also having aspects of Nazz and Todd Rundgren. The band has been described as &quot;...Chris Breetveld, and anyone who plays Breetles songs, with or without him&quot;. The original members of the band were Chris Breetveld, Jim Johnson on guitar, vocals &amp; mandolin type things, and Dennis McGrath (a.k.a. Blind Lemon Pledge) on Vocals and harmonica. Other members and bands that are credited or have featured on The Breetles&#x27; albums include: R. Stevie Moore, The Rockin&#x27;Bricks, Dave Amels, Richard Larsen, Eric Block, Bob Brainen, Joe Hosey, Tim Korzun, Jim Johnson, Chris Butler, Dennis McGrath a.k.a. Blind Lemon Pledge, Tom Lucas, Lane Steinberg, and others.

The Breetles debut album, &quot;Squares in Paris&quot;, was released in 1986 but recorded over a period of four years starting in 1982. Two more albums, &quot;Arkansas Traveler&quot; and &quot;Breetles 3, &quot;were released in 1987 and 1988 respectively. Arkansas Traveler is an entirely acoustical recording recorded to showcase the &quot;at home&quot; sound of The Breetles. The 1990s saw the release of three albums:&quot; Pop Go! The Breetles&quot; (1995), &quot;Spooj&quot; (1996), and &quot;Ego, The Story of the Sures&quot; (1998) . The band has consistently released albums during the 2000s starting with &quot;Writerscramp&quot; (2000), Don&#x27;t Smile (2003), Model24-One (2007), Sound Recordings (2011), Model24-Two (2012). Many of the albums and songs are entirely performed, produced, and engineered by Chris Breetveld.
Currently, the band is working on &quot;SONG FOLDER1&quot;.

<text>The term state papers is used in Britain and Ireland to refer to government archives and records. Such papers used to be kept separate from non-governmental papers, with state papers kept in the State Paper Office and general public records kept in the Public Record Office. When they were written, they were regarded as the personal papers of the government officials writing them, but in 1702, the State Papers Office was established and requisitioned them.

==Ireland==
In Ireland, these records were held in a single repository, the Public Record Office. In 1922, this was in two locations, the Bermingham Tower of Dublin Castle and the Four Courts on Dublin&#x27;s quays. However, the vast majority of records, particularly before 1790, were held in the Four Courts. When the Four Courts was occupied by anti-Treaty forces of the Irish Republican Army in April 1922, the pro-Treaty forces came under pressure to remove them. Following the assassination of the British Field Marshal, Henry Hughes Wilson by anti-Treaty forces on 22 June, the British 
government pressed the Provisional Government to take action or else British forces, still occupying Ireland, would intervene. On 27 June, Michael Collins, leader of the pro-Treaty IRA, gave the order to attack the occupying force in what is widely regarded as the opening shot of the Irish Civil War. In the process, whether by external artillery or internal sabotage, most of these records were destroyed.

The Irish State Paper Office contains papers from the offices of:
* President of Ireland
* Taoiseach
* Oireachtas, i.e. Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann
* Departments of State

There are papers also from former offices of state, including:
* King of Ireland
* Monarch of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland relating to Ireland
* Lord Lieutenant of Ireland
* Chief Secretary for Ireland
* Under Secretary for Ireland
* Irish House of Commons &amp; Irish House of Lords
* House of Commons of Southern Ireland
* Attorney-General for Ireland
* Governor-General of the Irish Free State

The Irish State Paper Office was formerly located in Dublin Castle, while the Irish Public Records Office was located at the Four Courts. In the late 1980s the distinction was abolished and both archives merged and moved to a new National Archives of Ireland in Bishop Street in Dublin.

==United Kingdom==
The National Archives of the United Kingdom is located in Kew, near London. The Royal Archives are kept separately at Windsor Castle.

There are separate national archives for Scotland (the National Records of Scotland) and Northern Ireland (the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland).

<doc id="420598" wikidata="Q215624" url="?curid=420598" title="Biochemical oxygen demand">
<text>Biochemical oxygen demand (also known as BOD or biological oxygen demand) is an analytical parameter representing the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) consumed by aerobic bacteria growing on the organic material present in a water sample at a specific temperature over a specific time period. The BOD value is most commonly expressed in milligrams of oxygen consumed per liter of sample during 5 days of incubation at 20 °C and is often used as a surrogate of the degree of organic water pollution.

Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) reduction is used as a gauge of the effectiveness of wastewater treatment plants. BOD of wastewater effluents is used to indicate the short-term impact on the oxygen levels of the receiving water.

BOD analysis is similar in function to chemical oxygen demand (COD) analysis, in that both measure the amount of organic compounds in water. However, COD analysis is less specific, since it measures everything that can be chemically oxidized, rather than just levels of biologically oxidized organic matter.

==Background==
Most natural waters contain small quantities of organic compounds. Aquatic microorganisms have evolved to use some of these compounds as food. Microorganisms living in oxygenated waters use dissolved oxygen to oxidatively degrade the organic compounds, releasing energy which is used for growth and reproduction. Populations of these microorganisms tend to increase in proportion to the amount of food available. This microbial metabolism creates an oxygen demand proportional to the amount of organic compounds useful as food. Under some circumstances, microbial metabolism can consume dissolved oxygen faster than atmospheric oxygen can dissolve into the water or the autotrophic community (algae, cyanobacteria and macrophytes) can produce. Fish and aquatic insects may die when oxygen is depleted by microbial metabolism.

Biochemical oxygen demand is the amount of oxygen required for microbial metabolism of organic compounds in water. This demand occurs over some variable period of time depending on temperature, nutrient concentrations, and the enzymes available to indigenous microbial populations. The amount of oxygen required to completely oxidize the organic compounds to carbon dioxide and water through generations of microbial growth, death, decay, and cannibalism is total biochemical oxygen demand (total BOD). Total BOD is of more significance to food webs than to water quality. Dissolved oxygen depletion is most likely to become evident during the initial aquatic microbial population explosion in response to a large amount of organic material. If the microbial population deoxygenates the water, however, that lack of oxygen imposes a limit on population growth of aerobic aquatic microbial organisms resulting in a longer term food surplus and oxygen deficit.

A standard temperature at which BOD testing should be carried out was first proposed by the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal in its eighth report in 1912:
(c) An effluent in order to comply with the general standard must not contain as discharged more than 3 parts per 100,000 of suspended matter, and with its suspended matters included must not take up at 65 °F (18.3 °C) more than 2.0 parts per 100,000 of dissolved oxygen in 5 days. This general standard should be prescribed either by Statute or by order of the Central Authority, and should be subject to modifications by that Authority after an interval of not less than ten years.
This was later standardised at 68 °F and then 20 °C. This temperature may be significantly different from the temperature of the natural environment of the water being tested.

Although the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal proposed 5 days as an adequate test period for rivers of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, longer periods were investigated for North American rivers. Incubation periods of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 days were being used into the mid-20th century. Keeping dissolved oxygen available at their chosen temperature, investigators found up to 99 percent of total BOD was exerted within 20 days, 90 percent within 10 days, and approximately 68 percent within 5 days. Variable microbial population shifts to nitrifying bacteria limit test reproducibility for periods greater than 5 days. The 5-day test protocol with acceptably reproducible results emphasizing carbonaceous BOD has been endorsed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This 5-day BOD test result may be described as the amount of oxygen required for aquatic microorganisms to stabilize decomposable organic matter under aerobic conditions. Stabilization, in this context, may be perceived in general terms as the conversion of food to living aquatic fauna. Although these fauna will continue to exert biochemical oxygen demand as they die, that tends to occur within a more stable evolved ecosystem including higher trophic levels.
== History ==
The &quot;Royal Commission on River Pollution&quot;, established in 1865, and the formation of the &quot;Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal&quot; in 1898 led to the selection in 1908 of BOD5 as the definitive test for organic pollution of rivers. Five days was chosen as an appropriate test period because this is supposedly the longest time that river water takes to travel from source to estuary in the U.K. In its sixth report the Royal Commission recommended that the standard set should be 15 parts by weight per million of water. However, in the Ninth report the commission had revised the recommended standard: An effluent taking up 2–0 parts dissolved oxygen per 100,000 would be found by a simple calculation to require dilution with at least 8 volumes of river water taking up 0.2 part if the resulting mixture was not to take up more than 0.4 part. Our experience indicated that in a large majority of cases the volume of river water would exceed 8 times the volume of effluent, and that the figure of 2–0 parts dissolved oxygen per 100,000, which had been shown to be practicable, would be a safe figure to adopt for the purposes of a general standard, taken in conjunction with the condition that the effluent should not contain more than 3–0 parts per 100,000 of suspended solids. This was the cornerstone 20:30 (BOD:Suspended Solids) + full nitrification standard which was used as a yardstick in the U.K. up to the 1970s for sewage works effluent quality.

The United States includes BOD effluent limitations in its secondary treatment regulations. Secondary sewage treatment is generally expected to remove 85 percent of the BOD measured in sewage and produce effluent BOD concentrations with a 30-day average of less than 30 mg/L and a 7-day average of less than 45 mg/L. The regulations also describe &quot;treatment equivalent to secondary treatment&quot; as removing 65 percent of the BOD and producing effluent BOD concentrations with a 30-day average less than 45 mg/L and a 7-day average less than 65 mg/L.

=== Typical values ===
Most pristine rivers will have a 5-day carbonaceous BOD below 1 mg/L. Moderately polluted rivers may have a BOD value in the range of 2 to 8 mg/L. Rivers may be considered severely polluted when BOD values exceed 8 mg/L. Municipal sewage that is efficiently treated by a three-stage process would have a value of about 20 mg/L or less. Untreated sewage varies, but averages around 600 mg/L in Europe and as low as 200 mg/L in the U.S., or where there is severe groundwater or surface water infiltration/inflow. The generally lower values in the U.S. derive from the much greater water use per capita than in other parts of the world.

== Use in sewage treatment ==

The BOD is used in measuring waste loadings to treatment plants and in evaluating the BOD-removal efficiency of such treatment systems.

== Methods ==
Winkler published the methodology of a simple, accurate and direct dissolved oxygen analytical procedure in 1888. Since that time, the analysis of dissolved oxygen levels for water has been key to the determination of surface water. The Winkler method is still one of only two analytical techniques used to calibrate oxygen electrode meters; the other procedure is based on oxygen solubility at saturation as per Henry&#x27;s law.

There are two recognized methods for the measurement of dissolved oxygen for BOD and a number of other methods not currently internationally recognised as standard methods

=== Dilution method ===
This standard method is recognized by EPA, which is labeled Method 5210B in the &quot;Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater.&quot; In order to obtain BOD5, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in a sample must be measured before and after the incubation period, and appropriately adjusted by the sample corresponding dilution factor. This analysis is performed using 300 mL incubation bottles in which buffered dilution water is dosed with seed microorganisms and stored for 5 days in the dark room at 20 °C to prevent DO production via photosynthesis. The bottles have traditionally been made of glass, which required cleaning and rinsing between samples. A SM 5210B approved, disposable, plastic BOD bottle is available which eliminates this step. In addition to the various dilutions of BOD samples, this procedure requires dilution water blanks, glucose glutamic acid (GGA) controls, and seed controls. The dilution water blank is used to confirm the quality of the dilution water that is used to dilute the other samples. This is necessary because impurities in the dilution water may cause significant alterations in the results. The GGA control is a standardized solution to determine the quality of the seed, where its recommended BOD5 concentration is 198 mg/L ± 30.5 mg/L. For measurement of carbonaceous BOD (cBOD), a nitrification inhibitor is added after the dilution water has been added to the sample. The inhibitor hinders the oxidation of ammonia nitrogen, which supplies the nitrogenous BOD (nBOD). When performing the BOD5 test, it is conventional practice to measure only cBOD because nitrogenous demand does not reflect the oxygen demand from organic matter. This is because nBOD is generated by the breakdown of proteins, whereas cBOD is produced by the breakdown of organic molecules.

BOD5 is calculated by:
*Unseeded :formula_1
*Seeded: formula_2

where:
:formula_3 is the dissolved oxygen (DO) of the diluted solution after preparation (mg/L)
:formula_4 is the DO of the diluted solution after 5 day incubation (mg/L)
:formula_5 is the decimal dilution factor
:formula_6 is the DO of diluted seed sample after preparation (mg/L)
:formula_7 is the DO of diluted seed sample after 5 day incubation (mg/L)
:formula_8 is the ratio of seed volume in dilution solution to seed volume in BOD test on seed

=== Manometric method ===
This method is limited to the measurement of the oxygen consumption due only to carbonaceous oxidation. Ammonia oxidation is inhibited.

The sample is kept in a sealed container fitted with a pressure sensor. A substance that absorbs carbon dioxide (typically lithium hydroxide) is added in the container above the sample level. The sample is stored in conditions identical to the dilution method. Oxygen is consumed and, as ammonia oxidation is inhibited, carbon dioxide is released. The total amount of gas, and thus the pressure, decreases because carbon dioxide is absorbed. From the drop of pressure, the sensor electronics computes and displays the consumed quantity of oxygen.

The main advantages of this method compared to the dilution method are:
* simplicity: no dilution of sample required, no seeding, no blank sample.
* direct reading of BOD value.
* continuous display of BOD value at the current incubation time.

== Alternative methods ==

=== Biosensor ===
An alternative to measure BOD is the development of biosensors, which are devices for the detection of an analyte that combines a biological component with a physicochemical detector component. Enzymes are the most widely used biological sensing elements in the fabrication of biosensors. Their application in biosensor construction is limited by the tedious, time-consuming and costly enzyme purification methods. Microorganisms provide an ideal alternative to these bottlenecks.

Many micro organisms useful for BOD assessment are relatively easy to maintain in pure cultures, grow and harvest at low cost. Moreover, the use of microbes in the field of biosensors has opened up new possibilities and advantages such as ease of handling, preparation and low cost of device. A number of pure cultures, e.g. &quot;Trichosporon cutaneum, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas sp.&quot; etc. individually, have been used by many workers for the construction of BOD biosensor. On the other hand, many workers have immobilized activated sludge, or a mixture of two or three bacterial species and on various membranes for the construction of BOD biosensor. The most commonly used membranes were polyvinyl alcohol, porous hydrophilic membranes etc.

A defined microbial consortium can be formed by conducting a systematic study, i.e. pre-testing of selected micro-organisms for use as a seeding material in BOD analysis of a wide variety of industrial effluents. Such a formulated consortium can be immobilized on suitable membrane, i.e. charged nylon membrane. Charged nylon membrane is suitable for microbial immobilization, due to the specific binding between negatively charged bacterial cell and positively charged nylon membrane. So the advantages of the nylon membrane over the other membranes are : The dual binding, i.e. Adsorption as well as entrapment, thus resulting in a more stable immobilized membrane. Such specific Microbial consortium based BOD analytical devices, may find great application in monitoring of the degree of pollutant strength, in a wide variety of industrial waste water within a very short time.

Biosensors can be used to indirectly measure BOD via a fast (usually &lt;30 min) to be determined BOD substitute and a corresponding calibration curve method (pioneered by Karube et al., 1977). Consequently, biosensors are now commercially available, but they do have several limitations such as their high maintenance costs, limited run lengths due to the need for reactivation, and the inability to respond to changing quality characteristics as would normally occur in wastewater treatment streams; e.g. diffusion processes of the biodegradable organic matter into the membrane and different responses by different microbial species which lead to problems with the reproducibility of result (Praet et al., 1995). Another important limitation is the uncertainty associated with the calibration function for translating the BOD substitute into the real BOD (Rustum &quot;et al.&quot;, 2008).

===Fluorescent ===
A surrogate to BOD5 has been developed using a resazurin derivative which reveals the extent of oxygen uptake by micro-organisms for organic matter mineralization. A cross-validation performed on 109 samples in Europe and the United-States showed a strict statistical equivalence between results from both methods.

An electrode has been developed based on the luminescence emission of a photo-active chemical compound and the quenching of that emission by oxygen. This quenching photophysics mechanism is described by the Stern–Volmer equation for dissolved oxygen in a solution:

:formula_9

* formula_10: Luminescence in the presence of oxygen
* formula_11: Luminescence in the absence of oxygen
* formula_12: Stern-Volmer constant for oxygen quenching
* &lt;chem&gt;[O2]&lt;/chem&gt;: Dissolved oxygen concentration

The determination of oxygen concentration by luminescence quenching has a linear response over a broad range of oxygen concentrations and has excellent accuracy and reproducibility.

===Polargraphic method===
The development of an analytical instrument that utilizes the reduction-oxidation (redox) chemistry of oxygen in the presence of dissimilar metal electrodes was introduced during the 1950s. This redox electrode utilized an oxygen-permeable membrane to allow the diffusion of the gas into an electrochemical cell and its concentration determined by polarographic or galvanic electrodes. This analytical method is sensitive and accurate down to levels of ± 0.1 mg/L dissolved oxygen. Calibration of the redox electrode of this membrane electrode still requires the use of the Henry&#x27;s law table or the Winkler test for dissolved oxygen.

===Software sensor===
There have been proposals for automation to make rapid prediction of BOD so it could be used for on-line process monitoring and control. For example, the use of a computerised machine learning method to make rapid inferences about BOD using easy to measure water quality parameters. Ones such as flow rate, chemical oxygen demand, ammonia, nitrogen, pH and suspended solids can be obtained directly and reliably using on-line hardware sensors. In a test of this idea, measurements of these values along with BOD which had been made over three years was used to train and test a model for prediction. The technique could allow for some missing data. It indicated that this approach was possible but needed sufficient historic data to be available.

=== Real-time BOD monitoring ===
Until recently, real-time monitoring of BOD was unattainable owing to its complex nature. Recent research by a leading UK university has discovered the link between multiple water quality parameters including electrical conductivity, turbidity, TLF and CDOM. These parameters are all capable of being monitored in real-time through a combination of traditional methods (electrical conductivity via electrodes) and newer methods such as fluorescence. The monitoring of tryptophan-like fluorescence (TLF) has been successfully utilised as a proxy for biological activity and enumeration, particularly with a focus on &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (E. Coli). TLF based monitoring is applicable across a wide range of environments, including but by no means limited to sewage treatment works and freshwaters. Therefore, there has been a significant movement towards combined sensor systems that can monitor parameters and use them, in real-time, to provide a reading of BOD that is of laboratory quality.

== Dissolved oxygen probes: Membrane and luminescence ==

The development of an analytical instrument that utilizes the reduction-oxidation (redox) chemistry of oxygen in the presence of dissimilar metal electrodes was introduced during the 1950s. This redox electrode (also known as dissolved oxygen sensor) utilized an oxygen-permeable membrane to allow the diffusion of the gas into an electrochemical cell and its concentration determined by polarographic or galvanic electrodes. This analytical method is sensitive and accurate to down to levels of ± 0.1 mg/L dissolved oxygen. Calibration of the redox electrode of this membrane electrode still requires the use of the Henry&#x27;s law table or the Winkler test for dissolved oxygen.

== Test limitations ==
The test method involves variables limiting reproducibility. Tests normally show observations varying plus or minus ten to twenty percent around the mean.

=== Toxicity ===
Some wastes contain chemicals capable of suppressing microbiological growth or activity. Potential sources include industrial wastes, antibiotics in pharmaceutical or medical wastes, sanitizers in food processing or commercial cleaning facilities, chlorination disinfection used following conventional sewage treatment, and odor-control formulations used in sanitary waste holding tanks in passenger vehicles or portable toilets. Suppression of the microbial community oxidizing the waste will lower the test result.

=== Appropriate microbial population ===
The test relies upon a microbial ecosystem with enzymes capable of oxidizing the available organic material. Some waste waters, such as those from biological secondary sewage treatment, will already contain a large population of microorganisms acclimated to the water being tested. An appreciable portion of the waste may be utilized during the holding period prior to commencement of the test procedure. On the other hand, organic wastes from industrial sources may require specialized enzymes. Microbial populations from standard seed sources may take some time to produce those enzymes. A specialized seed culture may be appropriate to reflect conditions of an evolved ecosystem in the receiving waters.

<text>Alan Arthur Johnson (born 17 May 1950) is a British politician who served as Secretary of State for Education and Skills from 2006 to 2007, Secretary of State for Health from 2007 to 2009, Home Secretary from 2009 to 2010, and Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2010 to 2011. A member of the Labour Party, he was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle from 1997 to 2017.

Johnson served in the Cabinet during both the Tony Blair government and that of Gordon Brown. He served under Blair as Minister of State for Universities from 2003 to 2004, as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions from 2004 to 2005, and as President of the Board of Trade from 2005 to 2006.

In May 2023, Johnson was announced as the next Chancellor of the University of Hull. He succeeded Virginia Bottomley in July.

== Early life ==
Born in London on 17 May 1950, the son of Stephen and Lillian Johnson, he was orphaned at the age of 13 when his mother died, his father having previously abandoned the family, forcing his sister Linda to become the primary care-giver and breadwinner. Soon after this, they moved to a council flat in Pitt House, Battersea, immediately adjacent to the Winstanley and York Estates, a traumatic change from their previous address in Notting Hill. Johnson describes how he and his sister faced hostility from neighbouring tenants, who were resentful because others (perceived by them as more deserving) were unable to obtain council housing at this time. This meant that their flat was often broken into and targeted for vandalism. Linda, herself aged only 16 at that time, has since been recognised as the hero of Johnson&#x27;s poignant 2013 memoir &quot;This Boy: A Memoir of a Childhood&quot;.

Johnson passed the eleven-plus exam and attended Sloane Grammar school in Chelsea, now part of Pimlico Academy, and left school at the age of 15. He then worked at Tesco before becoming a postman at 18. He was interested in music and joined two pop music bands. Johnson joined the Union of Communication Workers, becoming a branch official. He joined the Labour Party in 1971 and has described his views at the time as democratic socialist, having drawn ideological inspiration from studying George Orwell&#x27;s Nineteen Eighty-Four in school, although he also considered himself a Marxist ideologically aligned with the Communist Party of Great Britain. A full-time union official from 1987, he became General Secretary of the union in 1992.

Before entering parliament Johnson was a member of Labour&#x27;s National Executive Committee. During this time he was the only major union leader to support the abolition of Clause IV.

== Parliamentary career ==
Just three weeks before the 1997 general election, Johnson was selected to stand for parliament in the safe Labour seat of Hull West and Hessle when the previous incumbent, Stuart Randall, stood down suddenly. Randall subsequently became a member of the House of Lords.

=== In government ===
He was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to Dawn Primarolo in 1997 and achieved his first ministerial post at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) in 1999. He was moved to the Department for Education and Skills in 2003 as Minister for Higher Education although he had left school at 15.

Johnson, along with other ministers in Tony Blair&#x27;s government, and many other MPs, attracted much criticism for voting on 18 March 2003 for the Iraq war: &quot;to use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction&quot; leading to the UK joining the US invasion of Iraq two days later. He responded to such criticism on 21 February 2007 by saying &quot;The whole cabinet believed the intelligence we were presented [with] and we made our case to the British people based on it in good faith. As we all now know, that intelligence was wholly wrong. We will be judged historically as to whether getting rid of Saddam Hussein, despite all the consequences, was a positive thing or that the consequences outweigh the positives of getting rid of a brutal tyrant.&quot;

In September 2004, Prime Minister Tony Blair appointed Johnson to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions following resignation of Andrew Smith. Following the 2005 election, Johnson was initially announced on 6 May 2005 as being &quot;Secretary of State for Productivity, Energy and Industry&quot;, but after just a week, on 13 May, it was declared that the new title would not be used, after widespread derision of the new name, because the abbreviation for Johnson&#x27;s title, Productivity, Energy and Industry Secretary, would have been &quot;PENIS&quot;. The department&#x27;s old name was kept and Johnson served as Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. On 5 May 2006, one day after the 2006 local elections, his brief was changed to that of Secretary of State for Education and Skills, replacing Ruth Kelly.

=== Education Secretary ===
During his time as education secretary, Johnson brought in new ideas and proposals, including encouraging parents to spend more time with their children in a bid to help them progress with their literacy and numeracy skills. Johnson has also previously expressed some concerns over diplomas, and has opened up debate in parliament on the subject of what parental situation is best. He stated that in his view, it is the parents themselves who make the difference, not their marital situation. Johnson looked at improving pay and working conditions for teachers during his tenure as Education Secretary.

=== Health Secretary ===
Johnson became Secretary of State for Health on 28 June 2007, succeeding Patricia Hewitt in Prime Minister Gordon Brown&#x27;s first Cabinet. He later criticised breast cancer patient Debbie Hirst because she attempted to buy the cancer drug Avastin, which the NHS had denied her. Johnson told Parliament, patients &quot;cannot, in one episode of treatment, be treated on the NHS and then allowed, as part of the same episode and the same treatment, to pay money for more drugs. That way lies the end of the founding principles of the NHS&quot;.

When there was a problem with &quot;C. difficile&quot; at hospitals managed by the Maidstone &amp; Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, they dismissed their &quot;blameless&quot; chief executive &quot;both unlawfully ... and unfairly&quot; and agreed to pay her £250,000, much less than the sum that they were told that defending a case for unfair dismissal would cost. When the proposed payment became known, Johnson intervened and the Department of Health ordered the trust to withhold more than two-thirds of the severance payment, although its director general of finance, performance and operations said that &quot;it was &#x27;not unfair&#x27;&quot; that she should receive the money. When the case came to the Court of Appeal, the payment was restored in a judgement that was highly critical of the Department, including quoting her complaint that Johnson had made &quot;personal comments made about me ... without any reference to the Trust, or informing me, ... regarding my severance value and its non-payment&quot;.

=== Home Secretary ===
On 5 June 2009, Johnson was appointed to the position of Home Secretary during a reshuffle, replacing the first female holder of the post, Jacqui Smith.

In October 2009, Johnson sacked the chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), Professor David Nutt. Nutt had accused the government of &quot;distorting&quot; and &quot;devaluing&quot; research evidence in the debate over illicit drugs, criticising it for making political decisions with regard to drug classifications in rejecting the scientific advice to downgrade MDMA (Ecstasy) from a class A drug, and rejecting the scientific advice not to reclassify cannabis from class C to class B drug. Johnson wrote to the professor: &quot;It is important that the government&#x27;s messages on drugs are clear and as an advisor you do nothing to undermine public understanding of them. I cannot have public confusion between scientific advice and policy and have therefore lost confidence in your ability to advise me as Chair of the ACMD&quot;.
In January 2010, Professor Nutt established the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs, with the aim of publishing honest drug information. By 2 April 2010, seven members of the ACMD had resigned.

In February 2010, it came out in court that MI5 had known that Binyam Mohamed, a former Guantanamo Bay detainee, had been tortured or mistreated by the American services, despite earlier statements to the contrary. In response, Johnson insisted that the media coverage of the torture had been &quot;baseless, groundless accusations&quot;. He also said Government lawyers had not forced the judiciary to water down criticism of MI5, despite an earlier, draft ruling by Lord Neuberger, the Master of the Rolls that the Security Service had failed to respect human rights, deliberately misled parliament, and had a &quot;culture of suppression&quot; that undermined government assurances about its conduct.

=== Deputy leadership candidate and potential leader ===
Johnson publicly stated in May 2006 he expected to stand for the post of Leader of the Labour Party when Tony Blair stepped down. Johnson told the BBC in an interview on 9 November 2006 that he would in fact be supporting Brown and standing as deputy leader. He was successfully nominated onto the ballot paper for Labour Deputy leader with most number of nominations. On 24 June 2007, Johnson was narrowly beaten for the deputy leadership by Harriet Harman. He led in rounds 2 to 4 of the voting, until he was overtaken by Harman in the last round, eventually finishing with 49.56% of the vote.

Having been touted in the media as a possible successor to outgoing Labour leader Gordon Brown, Johnson announced to the BBC on 12 May 2010 that he would not be standing in the forthcoming leadership contest, and would instead be backing David Miliband.

In November 2014, amid criticism within the party of its leader Ed Miliband, Johnson again denied speculation that he was a potential leadership candidate.

=== Potential London Mayoral candidate ===

In 2010, there was much speculation that Johnson was going to stand as a candidate for the London Mayoral election after announcing that he was not going to contest the leadership. Many of Johnson&#x27;s close allies encouraged him to stand for the Mayoralty and he was thought to have been considering it. However, Johnson decided not to stand for the Labour Party selection for Mayor and instead backed Oona King for the candidacy, but she lost to Ken Livingstone. In 2011, there was speculation that Livingstone could be deselected as the Labour candidate in favour of Johnson but that did not happen. In 2012, following Livingstone&#x27;s defeat by Boris Johnson, many Labour members said that Johnson should have been the Labour candidate. Johnson then revealed that he did consider standing for Mayor of London but he felt that his allegiance was to Hull. However, he said that he would not stand for Mayor of London in the 2016 elections as he wanted to stay on as an MP.

=== Views on electoral reform ===
Johnson is a strong supporter of electoral reform, advocating the Alternative Vote Plus (AV+) system as recommended by the Jenkins Commission. He indicated that he would seek support within the Labour Party for an amendment to the government&#x27;s Bill on Electoral Reform, to add AV+ as an additional choice in the referendum. In 2010, it was rumoured that he would step down as an MP to trigger a by-election in Hull, to stand on a proportional representation ticket. He supported the Yes! to Fairer Votes campaign in the referendum on 5 May 2011. He appeared as one of the main Labour supporters of the Yes! campaign at a London event on 3 May 2011, at which Ed Miliband also appeared.

=== Views on trade unionism ===
Writing for the Blairite &quot;Progress&quot; magazine in 2013, Johnson described trade union officials as &quot;fat, white, finger-jabbing blokes on rostrums shouting and screaming&quot; and said in 2014 that &quot;A perception that Labour is in the pocket of the unions is damaging to the party ... The precious link between Labour and the unions becomes a liability rather than an advantage when it is allowed to look like a transaction.&quot;

=== Shadow Chancellor ===
Johnson was chosen as Shadow Chancellor in Ed Miliband&#x27;s first shadow cabinet, appointed on 8 October 2010. His first major speech was the Opposition response to the comprehensive spending review. The BBC reported that he had made several &quot;gaffes&quot; in his role as Shadow Chancellor and &quot;in an interview he appeared not to know the rate of National Insurance paid by employers, and he was also reported to have clashed with his party leader over the policy of introducing a graduate tax to replace university tuition fees. He resigned as Shadow Chancellor on 20 January 2011 after three and a half months in the job, citing personal reasons. He was replaced by Ed Balls.

===Since 2015===
Johnson campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union in the 2016 referendum, and was chair of the Labour Party&#x27;s &#x27;Labour In For Britain&#x27; campaign.

A critic of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, just before Corbyn was elected leader in 2016 for the second time, Johnson told Rachel Sylvester and Alice Thomson of &quot;The Times&quot;: &quot;He is totally incompetent and incapable of being the leader of a political party and he knows it. Corbyn was &#x27;useless&#x27; in the EU referendum campaign.&quot; Concerning moderates like himself: &quot;We’ve got to recapture this party again otherwise it’s dead and finished and gone&quot;. Johnson stood down at the 2017 general election. He was succeeded as MP by Emma Hardy.

In January 2020, he appeared as a contestant on reality singing show &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; dressed as a pharaoh.

In May 2023, he was appointed as Chancellor of the University of Hull and was installed on 1 July.

== Writing ==
=== Memoirs ===
His memoir of childhood, &quot;This Boy: A Memoir of a Childhood&quot;, was published in 2013. It won the Royal Society of Literature Ondaatje Prize (2014), and the Orwell Prize, Britain&#x27;s top political writing award.

His second volume of memoirs, &quot;Please, Mister Postman&quot; (2014), dealt with Johnson&#x27;s time as a postman and as a union representative. It won the Specsavers National Book Awards &quot;Autobiography of the Year&quot;.

His third volume of memoirs, &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; (2016), covered Johnson&#x27;s time as a politician in the UK Parliament.

His fourth and final volume of memoirs, &quot;In My Life: A Music Memoir&quot; (2018), covered Johnson&#x27;s lifelong interest in music.

The titles of all four of his autobiographical books are titles of songs written or performed by The Beatles.

===Non-fiction===
Johnson has written a biography of Harold Wilson, as part of a series of biographies on former British Prime Ministers, which was published in September 2024.

===Novels===
Johnson has written three novels in the &quot;Louise Mangan&quot; series, featuring Louise Mangan, a detective in the Metropolitan Police:
* &quot;The Late Train to Gipsy Hill&quot; (published in 2021) — in which Gary Nelson, an everyman in a London office job, is drawn into the world of an attractive fellow-commuter
* &quot;One Of Our Ministers Is Missing&quot; (2022) — in which Lord Bellingham, a Foreign Office minister and property tycoon, is reported missing in the White Mountains in Crete
* &quot;Death on the Thames&quot; (2024)

== Personal life ==
Johnson has been married three times. His first marriage was to Judith Elizabeth Cox, with whom he has one son and two daughters. After their divorce, he married Laura Jane Patient in 1991; the couple had a son, Ollie, born in 2000. The couple divorced in February 2014. In December 2015, Johnson married his third wife, businesswoman Carolyn Burgess.

His hobbies include music, tennis, reading, cooking, football, and radio. He supports Queens Park Rangers F.C..

<text>Roman Garby-Czerniawski (6 February 1910 – 26 April 1985) was a Polish Air Force captain and Allied double agent during World War II who used the code name Brutus.

==Early life==
Czerniawski graduated in the late 1930s from the Wyższa Szkoła Wojenna (WSWoj), a military academy at Warsaw in Poland.

==World War II==
As a former officer of the Polish Air Force, he volunteered to create an Allied espionage network in France in 1940. He set it up with Mathilde Carré who recruited the agents since some French declined to work for a Pole. The network was codenamed &quot;Interallie&quot;.

Czerniawski was evacuated to Britain to be examined by Polish intelligence, and met General Władysław Sikorski and was presented with the Virtuti Militari. He was returned to France by parachute in November 1941.

On 17 November 1941, the Abwehr group of Hugo Bleicher arrested Czerniawski and then Carré. The network had been uncovered because of the lack of proper operational security within the organisation, and many other members of the Interallie were picked up after Carré had agreed to co-operate with the Germans in return for her life. Czerniawski and others were imprisoned.

He was sent to England as an agent after the Germans offered him safety, but he revealed himself to the British authorities. He was debriefed by the British MI6 and Polish authorities about the security lapses of his organisation in France. He was then employed as a double agent by MI5 and used the codename &quot;Brutus&quot; (after Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger, Julius Caesar&#x27;s friend and assassin) under their Double Cross System.

His strong anti-Soviet attitude, manifested in his denouncing in a pamphlet that he authored of a Polish officer who attended an official reception at the Soviet embassy, led to doubts about his suitability. For that act of mutiny against the Polish authorities, he was arrested and imprisoned. MI5 produced a cover story that he had been detained in a sweep of &quot;anti-Bolshevik&quot; Poles.

A Polish court-martial found him guilty of gross insubordination, but to keep the matter quiet, it sentenced him to only two months imprisonment. After his release from prison, Czerniawski was unrepentant to his handlers.

MI5 doubted his reliability and thought him to be fickle and liable to meddle, and MI5 also harboured concerns that the Germans would be suspicious about his arrest and swift release. He was no longer permitted to operate the radio himself, and he was used only for the distribution of low-grade information (&quot;chicken feed&quot;).

Initial German suspicions faded, and in December 1943, the British decided to use Brutus for distribution of important deception information.

Therefore, he played a major part in the Allied deception prior to the D-Day landings in Normandy in 1944 as one of the primary agents passing false information as part of Fortitude South, the deception plan aimed at convincing Germany that the Allies would invade Europe in the Pas-de-Calais area across the English Channel from southeast England.

==Postwar==
After the war, he stayed in the United Kingdom and wrote &quot;The Big Network&quot;, which was published in 1961.

Czerniawski died in London on 26 April 1985 at the age of 75. He was buried in Newark-on-Trent in the area of Newark Cemetery for RAF burials.

<doc id="420602" wikidata="Q2018566" url="?curid=420602" title="Graham Young">
<text>Graham Frederick Young (7 September 1947 – 1 August 1990), also known as the Teacup Poisoner, was an English serial killer who murdered his victims via poison.

Obsessed with poisons from an early age, Young started poisoning the food and drink of relatives and school friends. He was caught when his teacher became suspicious and contacted the police. Young pleaded guilty to three non-fatal poisonings and, at age 14, was detained at Broadmoor Hospital. He later took responsibility for the death of his stepmother, though this has not been proven.

After being released in 1971, Young got a job in a factory in Bovingdon, Hertfordshire, where he began poisoning his colleagues, resulting in two fatalities and several critical illnesses. He was convicted on two counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder in 1972. Young served most of his life sentence at HM Prison Parkhurst, where he died of a heart attack in 1990.

The Young case made headlines in the United Kingdom and led to a public debate over the release of mentally ill offenders. Within hours of his conviction, the British government announced two inquiries into the issues it raised. The Butler Committee led to widespread reforms in mental health services, while the passage of the 1972 Poisons Act put severe restrictions on the purchase of deadly poisons. Young&#x27;s life story inspired the 1995 film &quot;The Young Poisoner&#x27;s Handbook&quot;.

==Early life and crimes==
Graham Young was born on Sunday, 7 September 1947 to Frederick and Bessie Young in Neasden, Middlesex; he had an older sister, Winifred. After his mother died of tuberculosis when he was fourteen weeks old, Young was sent to live with an uncle and aunt while his sister went to live with their grandparents. Several years later, Young&#x27;s father remarried and the family were re-united.

Young was fascinated from an early age by poisons and their effects, and considered Victorian poisoner William Palmer to be a personal hero. He also read extensively about black magic, Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. In 1959, Young attended John Kelly Boys&#x27; School, where he started to read books on advanced toxicology.

In early 1961, Young acquired antimony from a local chemist, signing the poisons register in the name &quot;M.E. Evans&quot;; his knowledge of poisons and chemistry convinced the chemist that he was older than he appeared. Beginning in February he began poisoning members of his family. First his stepmother Molly suffered vomiting, diarrhoea and excruciating stomach pain, which she initially dismissed as bilious attacks. Before long his father suffered similar stomach cramps, debilitating him for days at a time. Soon after, his sister became sick on a couple of occasions over the summer. Shortly afterwards, Young himself fell violently ill. It even seemed as if the mystery bug had spread beyond their household: a couple of Young&#x27;s school friends had similarly been repeatedly absent from school, both suffering from similar symptoms.

In November 1961, Winifred was served a cup of tea by her brother one morning but found its taste so sour she took only one mouthful before she threw it away. While on the train to work an hour later, she began to hallucinate, had to be helped out of the station and was eventually taken to hospital, where doctors came to the conclusion that she had somehow been exposed to the poisonous &quot;Atropa belladonna&quot;. Young was confronted by his father, but he claimed that Winifred had been using the family&#x27;s teacups to mix shampoo. Unconvinced, Young&#x27;s father searched his room but found nothing incriminating. Nevertheless, he warned his son to be more careful in future when &quot;messing about with those bloody chemicals&quot;.

On Easter Saturday, 21 April 1962, Young&#x27;s stepmother died. Her death was attributed to a prolapsed cervical disc, which was believed to have resulted from a road accident. Much later, Young told police that he poisoned her with a lethal dose of thallium. At her wake, Young poisoned a male relative after lacing a jar of mustard pickle with antimony. Shortly afterwards his father became seriously ill and was taken to hospital, where he was told that he was suffering from antimony poisoning and one more dose would have killed him. Young&#x27;s aunt, who knew of his fascination with poisons, became suspicious, as did a science teacher who discovered several bottles of poison in his school desk. The teacher and the headmaster arranged for Young to be interviewed by a psychiatrist posing as a careers advisor, who contacted police after Young revealed his extensive knowledge of poisons and toxicology.

Young was arrested on 23 May 1962 after returning home from school. Vials of thallium and antimony were found in his possession. When questioned by police, he confessed to poisoning his father, stepmother, sister and a school friend. Psychiatrist Dr Christopher Fysh testified that Young had a psychopathic disorder rather than a mental illness and had failed &quot;to develop a normal moral sense.&quot; He felt it was &quot;extremely likely&quot; that Young would re-offend and recounted a conversation in which Young said: &quot;I am missing my antimony. I miss the power it gives me.&quot; Fysh recommended that Young be detained at Broadmoor Hospital in Berkshire, an institution for patients with mental disorders who have committed criminal offences. Dr Donald Blair, another psychiatrist, concurred with Fysh&#x27;s viewpoint.

Young pleaded guilty to three charges of poisoning his father, sister and school friend and was convicted of &quot;malicious administration of a noxious thing to inflict grievous bodily harm&quot;. He was not charged for murdering his stepmother, as her autopsy report did not list poison as the cause of death. The judge, Justice Melford Stevenson, ruled that Young was to be detained under Section 60 of the Mental Health Act at Broadmoor. Furthermore, he was not to be released for fifteen years without the approval of the Home Secretary.

==Broadmoor==
At age 14, Young was among the youngest-ever inmates in Broadmoor&#x27;s history. Soon after his arrival, John Berridge, a fellow inmate, died of cyanide poisoning. Young was suspected by some staff and inmates, not least because he enjoyed explaining in detail how cyanide could be extracted from laurel leaves; the grounds around Broadmoor were covered with laurel bushes. However, Young&#x27;s involvement was never proven and Berridge&#x27;s death was officially ruled a suicide. Later, Harpic was found in a nurse&#x27;s coffee and the contents of a missing packet of sugar soap were discovered in a tea urn.

Young continued to read medical and toxicology textbooks, obtained from Broadmoor&#x27;s library. He also continued his interest in Nazism, reading William Shirer&#x27;s &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot; and Lord Russell&#x27;s &quot;The Scourge of the Swastika&quot;. At one point, Young grew a toothbrush moustache and took to mimicking the speeches of Hitler and listening to musical compositions by Richard Wagner, who had been one of Hitler&#x27;s idols.

In 1965, Young first applied for release from Broadmoor. His father and sister attended the tribunal and stated that if Young was released, none of his relatives would be willing to house him; his father also insisted that his son should &quot;never be released&quot;. Young&#x27;s application was rejected. Five years later, in June 1970, Broadmoor psychiatrist Edgar Udwin wrote to the Home Secretary to recommend Young&#x27;s release, announcing that he was &quot;no longer obsessed with poisons, violence and mischief. And he is no longer a danger to others.&quot; However, Young remarked to a Broadmoor nurse: &quot;When I get out, I&#x27;m going to kill one person for every year I&#x27;ve spent in this place.&quot;

==Later crimes==
Young was released from Broadmoor in 1971, after eight years&#x27; detention. He initially stayed with his sister and her husband in Hemel Hempstead. Within weeks he had resumed his interest in poisons, but an attempt to acquire poison from John Bell &amp; Croyden in Wigmore Street was unsuccessful, as the chemist refused to sell them without written authorization. Young duly returned with the required authorization on Bedford College headed notepaper and was sold 25 g of antimony potassium tartrate. He told the chemist that he needed it for a qualitative and quantitative analysis. Young later returned to the same chemist to purchase 25 g of thallium.

===Poisoning of Trevor Sparkes===
Young attended a storekeeping training course in Slough and stayed at a hostel in nearby Cippenham. He befriended 34-year-old Trevor Sparkes, another resident of the hostel, and the two occasionally visited a pub together or shared a bottle of wine in Sparkes&#x27; room. Young would later confess to poisoning Sparkes with antimony sodium tartrate. On the night of February 10, Sparkes fell violently ill, exhibiting diarrhoea, pins and needles in his legs and pains in his testicles; earlier in the evening he had accepted a glass of water from Young. Sparkes&#x27; symptoms returned periodically over the following months. He felt so ill during a football match that he had to leave the pitch after a few minutes. Specialists were unable to pinpoint the cause, variously diagnosing it as a kidney infection, bowel infection, urinary tract infection or stomach infection. Sparkes left Slough in April 1971 and gradually recovered.

===Bovingdon===
Young secured a job as assistant storekeeper at John Hadland Laboratories in Bovingdon, Hertfordshire, near his sister&#x27;s home in Hemel Hempstead. The company manufactured thallium bromide-iodide infrared lenses, which were used in military equipment. However, no thallium was stored on site, necessitating Young obtaining his supplies of the poison from a London chemist. On his application, Young falsely claimed that his lack of employment history was because he had suffered a nervous breakdown following the death of his mother in a car accident. His employers received references as part of his rehabilitation from Broadmoor, but were not informed that he was a convicted poisoner and a former Broadmoor patient. Young left Slough and rented a room in Maynard Road, Hemel Hempstead, at £4 per week.

Young&#x27;s new colleagues found him unpredictable; he could be surly and keep to himself, but on other days he could be more cheerful. During breaks he usually sat alone reading, invariably a book on one of his favourite subjects: war, chemistry, the Nazis or famous murderers. Young was not talkative unless one of his favourite topics was being discussed. His duties at Hadland included collecting drinks from the tea trolley in the corridor and bringing them to the storeroom. Each employee had their own mug, which made it easier for him to target specific individuals for poisoning.

Soon after Young&#x27;s arrival at Hadland, he started poisoning his co-workers, focusing on his immediate colleagues in the storerooms. His &quot;modus operandi&quot; was to slip poison, usually antimony or thallium, into their tea or coffee. Victims would fall ill with symptoms that included vomiting, stomach pains, nausea and diarrhoea. Initially the mysterious illness was assumed to be a virus and was nicknamed the &quot;Bovingdon Bug&quot;. Other explanations put forward were contamination of the local water supply and radioactivity from a disused airfield nearby.

===Murder of Bob Egle===
Young&#x27;s first victim in Bovingdon was 59-year-old Bob Egle, a storeroom manager at Hadland and Young&#x27;s immediate superior. Egle, a veteran of the Dunkirk evacuation, was often asked by Young about his wartime experiences. He began to fall ill in June 1971, weeks after Young&#x27;s arrival at the company, taking several days off work with diarrhoea and severe stomach pains. His health improved after a week-long holiday, but on his return Young put a lethal dose of thallium in his afternoon tea. Egle&#x27;s condition deteriorated rapidly from this point, consisting of intense back pain and numbness in his fingers and feet. He was transferred to the intensive care unit at St Albans City Hospital, where paralysis set in. Young seemingly showed a strong concern for Egle, repeatedly contacting the hospital for updates on his progress. Egle finally died on 7 July 1971. A post-mortem attributed Egle&#x27;s death to a rare form of polyneuritis known as Guillain–Barré syndrome.

Young was chosen to accompany managing director Godfrey Foster to Egle&#x27;s funeral as a representative of the department Egle had managed. Foster recalled Young remarking how sad it was that &quot;Bob should come through the terrors of Dunkirk only to fall victim to some strange virus.&quot;

===Poisoning of Ron Hewitt and Diana Smart===
During Egle&#x27;s absences, Young targeted his assistant Ron Hewitt, poisoning his tea with antimony. Hewitt had already accepted a job at another company and was working his notice (Young was specifically hired as his replacement). After leaving the company, he suffered no further symptoms. As a result of Egle&#x27;s death and Hewitt&#x27;s departure, Young was promoted to head storeman for a probationary period. For the next few months, his poisonings were limited to small doses of antimony in his co-worker Diana Smart&#x27;s tea, usually when she annoyed him. Young wrote in his diary: &quot;Di [Diana Smart] irritated me yesterday so I packed her off home with an attack of sickness. I only gave her something to shake her up. I now regret that I didn&#x27;t give her a larger dose, capable of laying her up for a few days.&quot;

===Poisoning of David Tilson and Jethro Batt===
On 8 October 1971, Young put thallium acetate in David Tilson&#x27;s tea. Tilson found the tea too sweet for his liking (Young had added sugar to disguise any unusual taste from the thallium) and therefore did not drink it all. Young administered a second dose of thallium a week later. Tilson was admitted to hospital with numb legs, breathing difficulties and chest pains. His skin was so tender he could not endure the weight of the bedsheets, and all his hair fell out. Young had a back-up plan to visit Tilson in hospital and offer him a bottle of brandy laced with more thallium. Subsequently, Tilson recovered, though he was left permanently impotent by the poisoning.

At the same time he was poisoning Tilson, Young also began poisoning another Hadland employee, Jethro Batt. Batt had become friendly with Young and would give him a ride home to Hemel Hempstead. Young admitted to administering 4 g of thallium to Batt in two doses, enough to kill him. However, Batt found the coffee Young had made for him too strong and did not drink it all. Nevertheless, Batt was admitted to hospital with stomach and chest pains, and his hair fell out. The poisoning made him suicidal. Batt ultimately recovered, but like Tilson he was also left impotent. Young apparently felt some remorse for poisoning Batt, writing in his diary: &quot;I feel rather ashamed in my action in harming J [Batt].&quot;

===Murder of Fred Biggs===
Fred Biggs, a 56-year-old local councillor and part-time employee at Hadland, was poisoned by Young with antimony, prompting the typical &quot;Bovingdon Bug&quot; symptoms. Then, on 30 October 1971, Young put three doses of thallium acetate in Biggs&#x27; tea. By the following day, Biggs had developed chest pains and had trouble walking. Within days, he was admitted to Hemel Hempstead General Hospital, then transferred to the Whittington Hospital in North London, followed by the London National Hospital for Nervous Diseases (now part of the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery). His central nervous system deteriorated to the point that he could not speak and had trouble breathing, and his skin began to peel off. Young expressed concern for Biggs&#x27; condition, continually telephoning Biggs&#x27; wife and the hospital directly to make enquiries. Biggs finally died on 19 November 1971.

==Investigation and arrest==
The management at Hadland became so concerned about the mysterious sickness that they initiated an investigation. Meanwhile, some of Young&#x27;s co-workers began to have suspicions about him. Smart noticed that Young was never affected by the bug and suggested he might be a carrier of the &quot;virus&quot;. Philip Doggett informed the management of Young&#x27;s unhealthy interest in poisons. The firm&#x27;s medical officer, Dr Iain Anderson, told staff that he had ruled out heavy metal poisoning as a possible cause, which led to an argument with Young, who insisted that the symptoms displayed by victims pointed to this diagnosis. Intrigued by the young storeman who seemed knowledgeable about medicine, Anderson sought out Young after the meeting and quizzed him further. He quickly discovered that Young had a deep knowledge of poisons and toxicology, which prompted John Hadland, the firm&#x27;s owner, to contact the police. Investigating officers noticed that the onset of the &quot;Bovingdon Bug&quot; coincided with Young&#x27;s arrival at the company. A background check revealed his earlier poisoning convictions.

Young was arrested at the home of his aunt and uncle in Sheerness, Kent, on 20 November 1971. Nothing incriminating was found on his person. He denied any wrongdoing, but as he was being led away his aunt overheard him ask the officers &quot;which one is it you&#x27;re doing me for?&quot; When police searched his bedsit, they discovered a large stash of bottles containing poisons, including 434 milligrams of thallium and 32.33 grams of antimony, the latter 200 times a lethal dose. Other poisons in his possession included atropine, aconitine and digitalis. His lodgings were also covered in Nazi paraphernalia, including swastikas and photos of Nazi figures. Police also discovered a detailed diary that Young had kept, noting the doses he had administered, their effects and whether he was going to allow each person to live or die. Upon further questioning by police, Young admitted that the initials in the diary referred to his co-workers (&#x27;F&#x27; was Fred Biggs, &#x27;D&#x27; was David Tilson and so on).

Young confessed to poisoning Egle, Biggs, Batt, Tilson and Trevor Sparkes, and said that he deliberately used different poisons in order to confuse doctors. He also boasted of having committed the &quot;perfect murder&quot; by killing his stepmother, Molly Young. He spent twenty minutes explaining to the officers the effects that thallium has on the human body. When asked why he had poisoned people who were his friends and colleagues, Young responded: &quot;I suppose I had ceased to see them as a people - at least, a part of me had. They were simply guinea pigs.&quot;

==Trial and prison==
Young was charged with two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder, four counts of administering poison with intent to injure and four alternative counts of administering poison with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. He pleaded not guilty, which made it difficult to find a barrister willing to represent him; the trial date had to be postponed several times. Eventually, Sir Arthur Irvine QC agreed to defend Young. John Leonard QC led the prosecution for the Crown. The judge was Mr Justice Eveleigh. The trial was held at St Albans Crown Court and started on 19 June 1972.

Due to safeguards protecting defendants, the jury could not be told of Young&#x27;s previous convictions for poisoning. Young retracted his earlier confession to the police, claiming he had only made it in order to get some rest. Nevertheless, the evidence against him was strong. The prosecution called 75 witnesses to give testimony; Young himself was the only witness in his defence. Excerpts from Young&#x27;s diary were read out in court; he claimed the diary was a fantasy for a novel. Examination of Biggs&#x27; internal organs found thallium in his intestines, kidneys, muscles, bones and brain tissue. The cremated remains of Bob Egle, which had not yet been scattered, were also analysed and found to contain 9 mg of thallium. The latter was the first instance of cremated ashes being used as evidence in a murder conviction.

On 29 June 1972, after one hour and 38 minutes of deliberation, the jury found Young guilty of two counts of murder (Egle and Biggs), two counts of attempted murder (Batt and Tilson) and two counts of administering poison with intent to injure (Smart and Hewitt). He was found not guilty of administering poison to Sparkes and Buck, and was acquitted on all four counts of administering poison with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Through his counsel, Young requested that he be sent to a conventional prison rather than return to Broadmoor. His request was granted and he was sentenced to life imprisonment, to be served at Park Lane Hospital (later Ashworth Hospital) in Maghull.

While at Ashworth, Young befriended Moors murderer Ian Brady, with whom he shared a fascination for Nazi Germany. Brady&#x27;s 2001 book, &quot;The Gates of Janus&quot;, in which he discusses various serial killers, includes a chapter on Young. Brady wrote that Young &quot;was genuinely asexual, finding even discussion of sexual matters not only uninteresting but also distinctly distasteful... Power and death were his aphrodisiacs and &quot;raisons d’être&quot;.&quot; Elsewhere Brady stated that &quot;it was difficult not to empathise with Graham Young.&quot;

Young died in his cell at HM Prison Parkhurst on the evening of 1 August 1990, one month before his 43rd birthday. The cause of death was listed as myocardial infarction. As Young had no history of heart disease, it has been speculated that he either committed suicide or was murdered by prisoners or prison staff who did not feel safe around him.

Young was cremated on 15 August 1990 and his ashes were scattered on the beach on 2 September 1990.

==Aftermath==
On 29 June 1972, the day Young&#x27;s trial ended, Home Secretary Reginald Maudling gave a statement in the House of Commons about the issues raised by the case. He confirmed that more safeguards were to be introduced governing the release of mentally ill offenders. Henceforth, no patient at a special hospital was to be discharged without two concurring recommendations from psychiatrists. Supervision of released patients was also to be improved.

Maudling ordered a review of current procedures for releasing offenders from psychiatric hospitals. The review was to be carried out by a three-man committee headed by Sir Carl Aarvold, Recorder of London. Their findings were published in January 1973. Maudling also announced an inquiry to review the management of mentally ill offenders in the criminal justice system, to be chaired by Lord Butler. This led to the Butler Committee&#x27;s recommendations in 1975, which resulted in the expansion in forensic mental health services with the development of regional (now referred to as medium) secure units in most of the health regions in England and Wales. Prior to that there had been only the high security hospitals of Broadmoor, Ashworth and Rampton.

Following Young&#x27;s conviction, reports of copycat poisonings appeared in the British press. In April 1973, Howard Grodnow of Ealing killed himself, having become convinced that he had been poisoned by Young after reading about the case. For the previous eighteen months he had suffered from severe chest pains, which he traced back to an encounter, in a Hemel Hempstead pub, with a young man obsessed with poisons and chemicals. In November 2005, a 16-year-old Japanese schoolgirl was arrested for poisoning her mother with thallium. She claimed to be fascinated by Young and kept an online blog, similar to Young&#x27;s diary, recording dosage and reactions.

The Poisons Act 1972 was created to restrict and control the sale of poisons after Young&#x27;s court case concluded.

==In popular culture==
A 1995 film called &quot;The Young Poisoner&#x27;s Handbook&quot; is loosely based on Young&#x27;s life.

Young was the subject of an episode of the ITV series &quot;Crime Story&quot;, entitled &quot;Terrible Coldness&quot;. It was broadcast on 6 October 1993. Young was portrayed by Mark Womack.

During his trial, Young expressed his hope that his waxwork would appear in Madame Tussauds&#x27; Chamber of Horrors. He later got his wish and his likeness appeared in the exhibit near those of Hawley Harvey Crippen and John Haigh.

In 2009, a painting of the Kray twins by Young was sold at an auction in Andover for £2,700.

Young&#x27;s sister wrote a book published by Robert Hale on the 18th January 1973 called &quot;Obsessive Poisoner: The Strange Story of Graham Young by his sister Winifred Young&quot;.

In 2021, Carol Ann Lee released a true crime book titled &quot;A Passion for Poison: Serial Killer. Poisoner. Schoolboy.&quot; published by John Blake (English journalist).

In 2024, Amazon Prime Video released a true crime documentary called &quot;Murder in a Teacup&quot; covering Young&#x27;s victims, specifically his family and childhood friend Christopher Williams and his victims from his time working at Hadlands.

<doc id="420604" wikidata="Q928110" url="?curid=420604" title="Ed Belfour">
<text>Edward John Belfour (born April 21, 1965) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender. Belfour was born in Carman, Manitoba and grew up playing hockey. He played junior hockey for the Winkler Flyers before going to the University of North Dakota where he helped the school win the NCAA championship in the 1986–87 season. The following year, Belfour signed as a free agent with the Chicago Blackhawks (after not being picked in the draft) alternating time between them and the Saginaw Hawks of the International Hockey League. Many regard Belfour as an elite goaltender and one of the best of all-time. His 484 wins rank fifth all-time among NHL goaltenders. Belfour was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the 2011 class, his first year of eligibility. In addition Belfour is one of only two players to have won an NCAA championship, an Olympic Gold medal, and a Stanley Cup (the other such player is Neal Broten).

His characteristic face mask earned him the sobriquet &quot;Eddie the Eagle&quot;, and some of his quirks and off-ice antics earned him the nickname &quot;Crazy Eddie&quot;. After wearing #30 for his tenure with the Blackhawks, Belfour switched to #20 while a member of the San Jose Sharks as a tribute to Vladislav Tretiak, his goaltending coach and mentor from the Blackhawks. He would wear this for the rest of his playing career.

==Playing career==

===Juniors and college===
Belfour played for three seasons in the Manitoba Junior Hockey League with the Winkler Flyers, helping the team to a first-place finish in 1986. As the starting goalie for the top team, Belfour finally received some notoriety and he joined the North Dakota Fighting Sioux for the 1986–87 season. The 21-year-old Belfour was a freshman, older than many of the upper-classmen on his team. He won 29 games that year, helping UND set a new NCAA record with 40 wins on the year and win the National Title. After the season Belfour, as an undrafted player, was able to sign with any team and signed with the Chicago Blackhawks.

===Minors and International===
For his first professional season, Belfour played for the Saginaw Hawks of the IHL. He won 32 games for the team and helped them reach the IHL semifinals. The following season saw Belfour split his time between the IHL and NHL, playing 23 games with the parent club. He was returned to Saginaw where he helped the team to a 2nd-place finish in the conference but faltered in the postseason and the Hawks were bounced in the first round.

Rather than return to Saginaw, Belfour played the 1989–90 season with the Canadian national men&#x27;s hockey team. He was recalled by the Blackhawks for their postseason run and produced a 4–2 record with a 2.49 GAA, far better numbers than the other two Blackhawk netminders.

===Chicago Blackhawks===
The next season, 1990–91, Belfour became the starting goalie, and had a strong rookie season. He notched 43 victories in 74 games (both NHL rookie and Blackhawk team records), finished the season with a 2.47 GAA and 4 shutouts. He also led the league in Save% (.910). It was the last time a goalie led the league in Wins, Save%, and GAA until Carey Price achieved the feat in the 2014–2015 season. For his success, he received the Calder Memorial Trophy for outstanding play by a rookie, and is the first person to receive the award under the &quot;Makarov Rule&quot; because he was a year under the new cutoff age of eligibility (26), the Vezina Trophy for best goaltender and the William M. Jennings Trophy for fewest team goals-against. He was also a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s most valuable player, the first rookie goaltender to do so. He would win the Vezina Trophy and Jennings Trophy again in 1993, and the Jennings Trophy once more with Chicago in 1995.

Belfour helped lead the Blackhawks to the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals in the 1991–92 season, where they met the defending champion Pittsburgh Penguins. In Game 1, Chicago had a 4-1 lead with 8:24 remaining in the second period. However, the Penguins would score twice in the span of a minute to narrow it to 4-3 for the final period. Jaromír Jágr managed to score the tying goal with five minutes remaining, before a late one-man advantage for the Penguins proved key with Mario Lemieux putting a shot rebound past Belfour to give Pittsburgh the go-ahead lead with thirteen seconds left. In total, Belfour had allowed five goals on 39 shots. After a 3-1 loss in Game 2, the series moved to Chicago, where one successful shot meant everything. Kevin Stevens scored with 4:34 left in the first period off Belfour, and Penguins goaltender Tom Barrasso bested Belfour with no goals allowed on 27 shots as Pittsburgh now was one win away from the Cup. Game 4 was a rollercoaster for all involved, especially Belfour. Four goals were scored in the first seven minutes of the game, with each team getting two. After Stevens scored on a wrist shot over Belfour (the second goal on four shots), he was taken out by head coach Mike Keenan for Dominik Hašek. Hašek went 21-for-25 in saves as Pittsburgh rallied late again to win the game and the Finals. On August 7, Hašek was traded to the Buffalo Sabres, where he received more playing time.

By the 1995–96 season, tension was forming between Belfour and backup goalie Jeff Hackett. By January 1997, reports had surfaced that the two had an incident near a locker room that saw Belfour call Hackett &quot;nothing more than a backup&quot;, although the two (along with their coach) asserted that they were more competitive with each other rather than having friction. A free agent after the season, Belfour was traded to the San Jose Sharks on January 25 for three players (right wing Ulf Dahlén, defenseman Michal Sýkora, goalie Chris Terreri) and a conditional second-round draft pick in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft after turning down an extension offer ($3.3 million) that would&#x27;ve raised his current rate ($2.75-million). Right after the trade, Hackett received a three-year extension deal.

Belfour finished his tenure with the Blackhawks ranking among the team leaders in many goaltending categories. Belfour finished third among all Blackhawk goalies in games played (415) and wins (201) in both categories ranking behind Hall of Famers Tony Esposito and Glenn Hall. Belfour also ranks fourth in shutouts (30), and second in assists (17). Belfour easily ranks as the Blackhawks&#x27; goalie leader in penalty minutes, with 242. Esposito, who played in more than twice as many games and minutes as Belfour, had only 31.

===San Jose Sharks and Dallas Stars===
Following a dismal half-season with the Sharks, Belfour signed as a free agent with the Dallas Stars on July 2, 1997. During the season, Belfour played 61 games and had a 1.88 GAA as his team won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy and made it to the Western Conference Finals only to lose to the Detroit Red Wings.

The next season, the Stars repeated their regular season championship and Belfour won his fourth William M. Jennings Trophy. In the playoffs, Belfour won duels against past Vezina- and Stanley Cup-winning goaltenders Grant Fuhr and Patrick Roy, respectively. The Stars won the Stanley Cup, beating the Buffalo Sabres in six games, capped by an incredible goalie duel against former backup Dominik Hašek that ended in a 2–1 win in the third overtime. Belfour made 53 saves to Hašek&#x27;s 50, and for the entire Finals, had a 1.26 GAA to Hašek&#x27;s 1.68.

Belfour backstopped his team to another consecutive finals appearance, winning his second seven-game Western Conference final duel against the Colorado Avalanche&#x27;s Patrick Roy. The Stars lost the Cup in double-overtime to the New Jersey Devils. Belfour had 4 shutouts in that playoffs, including a triple-overtime blanking of the Devils in game five of the finals series.

During the 2001–02 season, the Stars began to play poorly and there was a falling out between then-Stars coach Ken Hitchcock and GM Bob Gainey. After a poor season, the Stars decided not to re-sign Belfour and named Marty Turco the starting goalie for the next season.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
On July 2, 2002, Belfour signed as a free agent with the Toronto Maple Leafs after then Leafs goaltender, Curtis Joseph, chose to sign with the Detroit Red Wings. Belfour rebounded after a dismal season with the Stars, winning a franchise-record 37 games and helping his new team finish second in the Northeast Division. His 2.26 GAA ranked 11th in the league. During the season, he was invited to play in the mid-season All-Star Game in Florida, but a back injury forced him to miss the event. On April 1, he earned his 400th career win in a match against the Devils. In the playoffs, Belfour posted a 2.71 GAA and a .915 Save% in seven games in an opening-round loss to the Flyers. On April 16 in Game Four at the Air Canada Centre, Ed made 72 saves before losing 3–2 on an overtime goal by Mark Recchi. Belfour finished as runner-up for the Vezina Trophy, won that year by the Devils&#x27; Martin Brodeur.

In 2003–04, he posted a 34-19-6 record in 59 games as the Maple Leafs finished fourth overall in the conference standings. He recorded a 2.13 GAA and a .918 save percentage along with ten shutouts. On April 3 in the final game of the season, Belfour posted a 6–0 shutout over the Senators to secure home ice advantage in the opening round of the playoffs. That shutout gave him 10 on the season, setting a new personal best. In the playoffs, Belfour posted three shutouts in the opening round against the Senators, setting a record for shutout streaks in a series. However, in the second round, former teammate Jeremy Roenick eliminated the Leafs by putting a game 6 overtime goal past Belfour.

Belfour did not play during the NHL lockout in 2004–05, instead taking a minority stake in the projected Dallas Americans team in the proposed revival of the World Hockey Association while recovering and rehabilitating himself from primarily back-related injuries. The team had folded by October, 2004.

On November 28, 2005, Belfour won his 447th career NHL game, moving him into a tie with Terry Sawchuk for 2nd place in career wins. Ed made 34 saves in the 2–1 win over the Florida Panthers.

On December 19, 2005, Belfour moved past Sawchuk with a 9–6 win over the New York Islanders at the Air Canada Centre. He was honoured in a special pre-game ceremony on December 23, 2005, before a game against the Boston Bruins at the Air Canada Centre; the Leafs went on to win the game. At the end of the 2005/06 season, Belfour had a record of 457-303-111 in the regular season, and 88–68 in the playoffs.

On July 1, 2006, Maple Leafs General Manager John Ferguson, Jr. released Belfour to free agency after posting a 22-22-4 record and a 3.29 GAA.

===Florida Panthers===
On July 25, Belfour signed with the Florida Panthers. In October 2006, Alex Auld was injured while the two goalies were horsing around. On February 13, 2007, Belfour tied Hall of Famer Tony Esposito for eighth place on the career shutout list with his 76th in the Panthers&#x27; 1-0 blanking of the Montreal Canadiens. Later in the season, another injury to Alex Auld gave Belfour the chance to become starter. He started 27 consecutive games, a record for the Panthers. Belfour regained his form during the season by posting a 2.79 GAA, .902 save percentage, and 1 shutout in 57 games.

===Leksands IF===
On August 27, 2007, it was announced that Belfour would play with Leksands IF in the Swedish second division. (HockeyAllsvenskan). Belfour&#x27;s signing created much fanfare in the following months. He played his first professional game outside of North America in 18 years on October 31, 2007 with a 4–1 win over Sundsvall. Belfour followed up this game with a shutout streak lasting for 251 minutes, a club record in Leksand. He also broke the record for most shutouts during a whole season with 7.

During the division round, Belfour had a GAA of 1.79, which was the best of all goalies in Allsvenskan. During the playoffs, he had a GAA of 2.59 and a save percentage of .911.

==Eagle mask==
Throughout his career, Belfour has worn masks featuring an eagle on either side of his helmet. When asked why an eagle, he stated &quot;I&#x27;ve always liked the eagle as a bird. It is a strong figure representing individuality, leadership, confidence, and outstanding vision. Its hunting and aggression are characteristics I admire, so when I was thinking of what I wanted on my mask, the eagle was a natural choice&quot;. Belfour&#x27;s eagle has changed dramatically, from a rough Native looking style in Chicago, to a fierce competitive image in Dallas, while the background always features his current team&#x27;s colours. On the chin, there is an image of the logo for the Make-a-Wish Foundation, a charity very close to his heart, and the back plate highlights his passion for speed and restored cars. The car on the back is a 1941 Willys, along with the words Carman Racing, which is the name of Belfour&#x27;s car customization and restoration shop in Freeland, Michigan. Upon seeing Belfour&#x27;s eagle mask for the first time, Mike Keenan, his head coach when he started in the NHL, nicknamed him &quot;The Eagle&quot;.

==International play==
Belfour was selected to represent Canada at the 1991 Canada Cup Championship as the backup goaltender and was included in the squad for the 2002 Winter Olympic Team. In February 2002, Belfour won an Olympic gold medal with the Canadian men&#x27;s hockey team. Although he didn&#x27;t play in any of the Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, he did add depth in goal to the strong Canadian team backing up Curtis Joseph and Martin Brodeur.

==Personal life==

Early in the 2000–01 season, on October 20, Belfour pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge in which Belfour was intoxicated in a Dallas hotel room. While under arrest and being transported to the local division, he allegedly offered Dallas police officers $1 billion for his release without charges. He apologized to the Dallas Stars organization and police officers involved and was fined $3000 for resisting arrest.

Late in the 2006–07 season, Belfour, along with Panthers teammate Ville Peltonen, was arrested on April 9 outside of a South Florida nightclub and was charged with disorderly intoxication and resisting an officer without violence. He was released the same day from Miami-Dade County jail on $1,500 bond.

On January 28, 2020, Belfour was arrested and booked into the Warren County Regional Jail after an early morning incident at the Kentucky Grand Hotel and Spa in downtown Bowling Green, Kentucky. Belfour was charged with third-degree criminal mischief and alcohol intoxication in a public place. Belfour damaged hotel property, and was &quot;manifestly under the influence of alcohol to a point he was a danger to himself and others,&quot; according to the police report.

In his post-playing career he was inducted as a member of Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame The Manitoba Junior Hockey League also awards a trophy named after Belfour to its top goaltender each season.

<text>The Hidden Staircase is the second volume in the &quot;Nancy Drew Mystery Stories&quot; series written under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene, published in 1930 and revised in 1959. The original text was written by Mildred Wirt Benson, and she has said that it is her personal favorite of the Nancy Drew Books she wrote.

The novel was adapted as a Warner Bros. film, &quot;Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase&quot;, in 1939. Another adaptation of the book from Warner Bros. was released on March 15, 2019.

==Summaries==

===1930 edition===

At the beginning of the original edition of &quot;The Hidden Staircase&quot; Nancy is home alone while her father and their housekeeper, Hannah Gruen, are both out for the day. The doorbell rings and Nancy is introduced to the &quot;rude visitor,&quot; Nathan Gombet, who has come to see Carson Drew about some papers. When his persistence irritates and insults Nancy, she grows impatient and angrily tells him to leave and threatens to call the police.

Soon after, Nancy is surprised at her house by Allie Horner, whom she aided in &quot;The Secret of the Old Clock.&quot; Allie knows Nathan Gombet by reputation because he tried to steal eggs from her farm. When Carson Drew arrives home, he explains his history with Gombet: Gombet signed over his land to build a railroad and then decided after the construction that he had been cheated out of money.

The following day, Allie introduces Nancy to the Turnbull sisters, Rosemary and Floretta. They ask Nancy to help them learn the cause of the mysterious &quot;hauntings&quot; of their mansion in Cliffwood, several miles from River Heights. The sisters explain that numerous valuable items have gone missing from their Civil War-era mansion, but they cannot understand how any person could have entered the locked home during these different instances to commit the thefts.

After a gap of a few days in which Nancy visits with Helen Corning (a recurring friend in the earliest books in the series) Nancy stays overnight with the Turnbull sisters for a week to determine the source of their problems. She goes alone and has her own bedroom. Before she leaves, her father gives her a revolver from his desk to protect herself. He explains that he will be out of town on business in Chicago for a few days but no more than a week. They decide that when he knows the day of his arrival back in River Heights, Nancy will pick him up at the train station to discuss her findings at the Turnbull mansion.

Before Nancy leaves for Cliffwood, she receives a threatening letter telling her to stay away from the Turnbull mansion. While she is there more items are stolen and at one point they find a couple of canaries flying about the mansion. When Nancy notices a stone mansion across a hill which is almost identical to the Turnbull Mansion, the Turnbull sisters tell her that both mansions were built at the same time by distant relatives of theirs, two brothers who eventually became rivals during the Civil War. Likewise, they explain that none other than Nathan Gombet owns the other stone mansion, and he has even asked to purchase their house.

Armed with this knowledge, Nancy is certain that Nathan Gombet is the culprit behind the thefts and is determined to prove it. Meanwhile, her father, who sent a telegram to Nancy to pick him up on a certain day at the station for their meeting, disembarks to find Nathan Gombet waiting for him. Nathan confuses Carson and leads him to believe that Nancy has had an accident near Gombet’s mansion and is waiting there, in trouble. Distraught and believing Gombet, Carson Drew rides back to Gombet’s mansion, where he is then held prisoner. Nancy never receives the telegram from Carson Drew and worries that something is wrong since she cannot reach him.

Late one night, once the Turnbull sisters are asleep, and convinced that there is some passage between the two mansions, Nancy ventures out to Gombet’s mansion in the dark, rainy night, armed with her revolver and a flashlight. While she is running through the rain, she sees Gombet walking toward the Turnbull mansion. She decides that this is her only opportunity to get into his house and resists her urge to follow him.

After sneaking through a cellar window of Gombet’s house, Nancy is discovered by his servant. He ties her up and gags her when she tries to scream. She is locked in an upstairs room, but manages to free herself of the ropes and gag. In the closet of this room, Nancy finds a knob and after pulling it, discovers a hidden staircase. The stone staircase, as it turns out, leads to a large tunnel that splits off at various points, all of which lead into different rooms in the Turnbull mansion.

The next morning, Nancy and the Turnbull sisters go to the sheriff, who brings the police force to Gombet’s mansion. They find Nathan Gombet and the cell where he is holding Carson Drew as prisoner and arrest Gombet.

===1959 edition===

At the beginning of &quot;The Hidden Staircase,&quot; Nancy&#x27;s friend Helen Corning, calls her about a possible mystery to be solved. Helen introduces Nancy to Mrs. Flora Turnbull and Mrs. Rosemary Hayes. Helen is the great-granddaughter of Miss Flora and great-niece of Aunt Rosemary. Miss Flora believes that their home, Twin Elms, is haunted. Just after Nancy agreed to help solve the mystery of Twin Elms, a man named Nathan Gomber tells Nancy that her father, Carson Drew, is in great danger. Gomber represents a client and other landowners who are dissatisfied with the proceeds of land purchases for a new railroad. Mr. Drew tells Nancy to go to Twin Elms with Helen and help Miss Flora and Mrs. Hayes, as he will be traveling to Chicago during the first part of Nancy&#x27;s stay at the old estate, and will join her later.

After an enjoyable dance with her former prom date, Nancy and her father inspect the railroad construction near the river but are forced to swim to safety when a runaway truck nearly runs them down. Nancy and Helen pack their bags and head off to Twin Elms, with Helen announcing the news of her engagement to her boyfriend Jim Archer over the weekend, en route. At Twin Elms, Miss Flora explains her theory of a ghost and explains the disappearance of items both precious and of little value, and strange things happening, such as music playing with no explanation. A chandelier moving by itself, and a mask held up in the windows over the next few days lead Nancy to investigate the interior and exterior of the Colonial house thoroughly. Nathan Gomber, coincidentally, is trying to buy the historic home despite protests from the Turnbull family. Although an adjoining estate with a twin home is available for purchase, it is run down and not of interest to Gomber.

In the meantime, Nancy&#x27;s father fails to return from Chicago, and after tracing him to the train station, she is led to believe from eyewitness accounts that he has possibly been drugged and kidnapped. Nancy continues to search for clues to her father&#x27;s whereabouts and also to solve the mystery of the intruder at Twin Elms, helped by a night watchman and discovery of a secret room. She and Helen decide to investigate the neighboring estate for clues to a secret entrance since the house was built with the same design as Twin Elms.

Upon their arrival at the realtor, Nancy is horrified to discover Nathan Gomber has just purchased the neighboring estate. Mr. Dodd agrees to lend the girls a key since Gomber has not taken possession, and they make a daytime visit to Riverview Manor. Nancy finds a secret panel to an underground passage and staircase. The tunnel leads to another staircase. But at the top of the stairs is a man who stops Nancy and Helen. Nancy discovers a missing property owner, hidden staircases and passages inside Twin Elms; with police help, she finds her father imprisoned in a room off the tunnel. Nathan Gomber is found out and arrested.

==Reception==
By 2000, 1.8 million copies of &quot;The Hidden Staircase&quot; had been sold in the US market.

==Adaptations==
The novel was adapted as a Warner Bros. film, &quot;Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase&quot;, in 1939. Another adaption of the book from Warner Bros. was released on March 15, 2019.

The 12th installment in the Nancy Drew point-and-click adventure game series by Her Interactive, named &quot;Nancy Drew: Secret of the Old Clock&quot;, is loosely based on the novel and also incorporate elements from &quot;The Secret of the Old Clock&quot;, &quot;The Bungalow Mystery&quot;, and &quot;The Mystery at Lilac Inn&quot;.

A reference to the book is made in the pilot episode of the &quot;Nancy Drew&quot; television series with Nancy finding a missing girl behind a hidden staircase. Later in the first season, an episode named &quot;The Hidden Staircase&quot; Nancy returns to the old warehouse where she found the staircase.

<doc id="420608" wikidata="Q2141190" url="?curid=420608" title="Anchor bend">
<text>The anchor bend is a knot used for attaching a rope to a ring or similar termination. The name is a misnomer, as it is technically not a bend, but a hitch.

==Origins==

Its name originates from the time when &quot;bend&quot; was understood to simply mean &quot;tie to&quot;; today, a bend strictly refers to a knot that joins two lines. 

==Techniques==
While the knot can become jammed in some modern materials, it is usually easily untied after moderate loads; it can be made more resistant to jamming by taking an extra turn around the object—this will make for a one-diameter longer span of the end to reach around the standing part to be tucked (although in a case of tying to a small shackle or link of a chain, this might not be possible). It is the accepted knot for attaching anchors (or more usually anchor chains) to warps. The knot is very similar to a round turn and two half hitches except that the first half hitch is passed under the turn. In many everyday uses, the finishing half-hitch need not be made; alternatively, one might seek surer security by tying off the end with a strangle knot to the standing part.

<doc id="420615" wikidata="Q7991601" url="?curid=420615" title="What the Butler Saw (mutoscope)">
<text>What the Butler Saw is a mutoscope reel and an early example of erotic films dating from the early 1900s. It depicted a scene of a woman partially undressing in her bedroom, as if some voyeuristic &quot;butler&quot; were watching her through a keyhole. The film was seen by depositing a coin in a freestanding viewing machine, which then freed a hand-crank on the side which was turned by the viewer. Social standards are subject to change, and by the 1950s this and similar films were considered harmless when compared to contemporary erotica. 

The title of this feature became widely used in Britain as a generic term for devices and films of this type. The phrase had entered British popular culture after the 1886 divorce case of Lord Colin Campbell and Gertrude Elizabeth Blood. The trial hinged on whether their butler could have seen Lady Colin &quot;in flagrante&quot; with Captain Shaw of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, through the keyhole of their dining room at 79 Cadogan Place, London.

<doc id="420616" wikidata="Q661327" url="?curid=420616" title="Battle of Mühlberg">
<text>The Battle of Mühlberg took place near Mühlberg in the Electorate of Saxony in 1547, during the Schmalkaldic War. The Catholic princes of the Holy Roman Empire led by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V decisively defeated the Lutheran Schmalkaldic League of Protestant princes under the command of Elector John Frederick I of Saxony and Landgrave Philip I of Hesse.

The battle ended the Schmalkaldic war and led to the dissolution of the Schmalkaldic League.

==Background==
The spread of the Protestant Reformation in Germany after 1517 represented a major obstacle to the universalistic projects of Charles V, the Habsburg emperor. Attempts at reconciliation between Lutherans and Catholics at the diets of Speyer of 1526 and 1529 had failed, sharpening the mutual opposition between the two opposing sides.

The Reformation offered to most independent German states the pretext to affirm their autonomy not only on the religious level, but also on the political one. For some of these small states, belonging to the Holy Roman Empire (a political reality that had been fragmented for centuries) was indeed considered not much more than a mere formal act.

In 1531 some princes (most notably Philip I of Hesse and John Frederick, Elector of Saxony) were opposed to the Emperor&#x27;s attempt to restore religious and political unity in the German lands through the re-proposal of the Worms Edict. This led to the formation of the Schmalkaldic League (named after the town of Schmalkalden in Thuringia where the pact was stipulated), a militarily defensive alliance with a markedly anti-Habsburg and anti-Catholic stance.

Although the birth of a Protestant coalition inside the Empire imperilled his power, Charles V did not initially attack the League. The League meanwhile received support from several free cities (Bremen, Hamburg, Lübeck, Ulm and Strasbourg), wishing to affirm their independence from the central power. The Protestant princes could also count on the support of the Kingdom of France, Charles&#x27; main foreign enemy. In need of the military support of the German states in his war against the Ottoman Turks in the eastern regions of his lands, the Emperor chose not to oppose the League and to grant wide autonomy to it. The Protestant leaders were therefore left free to support the Reformation and to fight the power of the Catholic bishops in the lands they controlled.

The conditions that forced Charles V to accept the actions of the League changed after a few years. In 1544 the signing of the Treaty of Crépy ended after decades the conflicts between the Emperor and Francis I of France for the control of the Italian peninsula. After the treaty the League lost the support of the French. Martin Luther&#x27;s death in 1546 and the temporary cessation of the Turkish threat from the east also put Charles in the best possible condition to focus on the internal enemy that endangered the religious and territorial unity of Imperial Germany.

The opportunity to begin the conflict was given by the rivalry between the elector of Saxony John Frederick I and his cousin Maurice, both belonging to the House of Wettin. Despite his Protestant faith, Maurice had in 1542 refused to join the Schmalkaldic League. In 1546, with the assistance of Ferdinand I, the younger brother of Charles V, Maurice invaded the territory of John Frederick. When the attack begun John Frederick&#x27;s armies were in Württemberg, but they managed to move to the occupied lands and repel Maurice&#x27;s forces.

The Emperor decided to take advantage of the divisions between the Protestant armies, and he joined the war in 1547. He occupied Ulm and Württemberg and defeated the Palatine Elector, forcing him to surrender and to leave the League. With the beginning of spring Charles then marched toward Saxony to help Maurice&#x27;s army and to end his clash with John Frederick, the last Protestant prince still opposing him.

==Battle==
Charles was suffering from gout at that time and his army had to face the desertion of the Papal soldiers that had helped him in the first part of the campaign. In addition the Saxon Elector&#x27;s army was larger than Charles&#x27; forces. However, hoping to encourage a Protestant and anti-imperial uprising in Bohemia, John Frederick took the decision to split his forces and he deployed a large portion of his troops there.

He had also left some small detachments to protect the most vulnerable Saxon cities in order to prevent the entry of Charles&#x27; army from the south. With the intention of reaching the well-defended stronghold of Wittenberg, the Elector then marched northwards, abandoning his position in Meissen and camping at the end of April at the town of Mühlberg, leaving only a few troops as guards on the bank of the Elbe river, that he considered too wide to be easily crossed by the imperial forces.

At the head of his army, Charles V arrived at the Elbe on the evening of 23 April. Despite the contrary opinion of his generals, he decided to attack the enemy forces, resting just a few miles away. At dawn on 24 April the first avant-gardes of the imperial army advanced, looking for a way for all the army to cross the river. Helped by the surprise and by the dense fog that had risen from the river, small groups of Spanish and Italian veteran soldiers managed to swim across the river and eliminate the few Saxon troops that were guarding the other side.

Meanwhile, some troops of the &quot;tercios&quot; of Lombardy and Naples, that were the most experienced soldiers in Charles&#x27; army, followed a plan set by Don Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba and commander-in-chief of the Imperial troops in Germany and with the help of a local farmer, they managed to spot a ford to use that would allow all the army to cross the Elbe. In addition to this, some veteran soldiers were able to prevent the demolition of a pontoon bridge built by the Saxons, that was immediately used by the Imperial cavalry to pass safely to the other shore.

According to some sources John Frederick had considered an attack from Charles so unlikely that he would have ordered several commanders of his army to go to Mass just when the enemy army was about to complete the crossing of the Elbe. The Saxon forces were completely taken by surprise. As soon as he became aware of the fact, the Elector&#x27;s first thought was to retreat towards Wittenberg. He soon realized though that his army would be too slow to be prepared to march in a short while; moreover, he was convinced that only a vanguard of the main imperial army was attacking. So he ordered his troops to prepare for battle.

John Frederick chose to deploy his troops along the edge of a forest, in order to prevent a possible encirclement by the imperial cavalry and to have a safer escape route in case of retreat. The emperor Charles V also reached the battlefield and exhorted his troops to fight the Protestants. Due to gout, he was carried to the battle in a litter, rather than mounted in armour on the great warhorse as depicted by his court painter, Titian and assisted to the battle from the rear. The imperial army was made up of about 16–20,000 men. Among them there were the &quot;tercio&quot; of Lombardy, that of Naples, and that of Hungary, led by Álvaro de Sande.

The battle began in the evening; the Saxon army, mainly made up of peasants, succeeded in repelling the first assaults of the Hungarian cavalry, but the greater number and better preparedness of Charles&#x27; soldiers, among the best in the world at that time, decided the fate of the clash. The emperor had placed his cavalry on the two wings of his army. The right wing, under the direct command of the Duke of Alba, was heavier than the left one, led by Maurice of Saxony.

Once the fragile wings of the Saxon army were defeated, the infantry &quot;tercios&quot;, placed at the center, had a good game in breaking enemy resistance, forcing the Protestants to retreat through the adjacent forest. The Elector of Saxony showed great courage on the battlefield, but was wounded in the face and captured by the imperial troops. The main part of his soldiers were chased and killed or captured.

Some sources report that Emperor Charles V commented on the victory with the sentence &quot;Vine, vi y venció Dios&quot; (in Spanish &quot;I came, I saw, and God won&quot;), a paraphrase of the famous exclamation pronounced by Julius Caesar.

==Aftermath==

The battle ended with a complete defeat of the Saxon army which suffered severe losses, estimated at around 2000–3000 men. In addition, the Protestants suffered the almost complete capture of their artillery, ammunition, and banners; many soldiers also ended up prisoners. On the imperial side, around fifty soldiers were killed.

John Frederick was responsible for not preparing an adequate defense on the river Elbe; that could have prevented the imperial troops from crossing it. His surrender symbolically sanctioned the end of the Schmalkaldic League. Charles decided to spare his life, but he had to exchange it with the capitulation of the stronghold of Wittenberg. He was condemned as a heretic and imprisoned, and was forced to leave the electoral privilege to his cousin Maurice, who for his help in the imperial victory, was given the control of the Electorate of Saxony. John Frederick was later released in 1552, two years before his death.

The surrender of Philip of Hesse soon afterwards ended the Schmalkaldic War, but the Protestant problem remained unresolved. Many of the princes and key reformers, such as Martin Bucer, fled to England, where they directly influenced the English Reformation. The peace reached between Catholic and Protestants in Germany (Augsburg Interim, 1548) was not enough to bring peace inside the Empire and only in 1555 the Peace of Augsburg stated the end of the wars of religion in the Empire, allowing each ruler to choose between Catholicism and Lutheranism. That principle ended the project to reunite Germany under a single religious confession.

The town of Mühlberg hosts a small museum dedicated to the battle.

<doc id="420617" wikidata="Q965456" url="?curid=420617" title="George MacDonald Fraser">
<text>George MacDonald Fraser (2 April 1925 – 2 January 2008) was a Scottish author and screenwriter. He is best known for a series of works that featured the character Flashman. Over the course of his career he wrote eleven novels and one short-story collection in the Flashman series of novels, as well as non-fiction, short stories, novels and screenplays—including those for the James Bond film &quot;Octopussy&quot;, &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (along with both its sequels) and an adaptation of his own novel &quot;Royal Flash&quot;.

==Biography==
Fraser was born in Carlisle, England, on 2 April 1925, son of medical doctor William Fraser and nurse Annie Struth, née Donaldson. Both his parents were Scottish. It was his father who passed on to Fraser his love of reading, and a passion for his Scottish heritage.

Fraser was educated at Carlisle Grammar School and Glasgow Academy; he later described himself as a poor student due to &quot;sheer laziness&quot;. This meant that he was unable to follow his father&#x27;s wishes and study medicine.

===War service===
In 1943, during World War II, Fraser enlisted in the Border Regiment and served in the Burma campaign, as recounted in his memoir &quot;Quartered Safe Out Here&quot; (1993). After completing his Officer Cadet Training Unit (OCTU) course, Fraser was granted a commission into the Gordon Highlanders. He served with them in the Middle East and North Africa immediately after the war, notably in Tripoli. In 1947, Fraser decided against remaining with the army and took up his demobilisation. He wrote semi-autobiographical stories and anecdotes of his time with the Gordon Highlanders in the &quot;McAuslan&quot; series.

===Journalism===
After his discharge, Fraser returned to the United Kingdom. Through his father he got a job as a trainee reporter on the &quot;Carlisle Journal&quot; and married another journalist, Kathleen Hetherington. They travelled to Canada, working on newspapers there, before returning to Scotland. Starting in 1953, Fraser worked for many years as a journalist at the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot; newspaper, where he was deputy editor from 1964 until 1969. He briefly held the title of acting editor.

===Novelist and screenwriter===
In 1966, Fraser got the idea to turn Flashman, a fictional coward and bully originally created by Thomas Hughes in &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; (1857), into a &quot;hero&quot;, and he wrote a novel around the character&#x27;s exploits. The book proved popular and sale of the film rights enabled Fraser to become a full-time writer. He moved to the Isle of Man where he could pay less tax.

There was a series of further Flashman novels, presented as packets of memoirs written by the nonagenarian Flashman looking back on his days as a hero of the British Army during the 19th century. The series is notable for the accuracy of its historical settings and praise it received from critics. For example, P. G. Wodehouse said of &quot;Flashman&quot;, &quot;If ever there was a time when I felt that &#x27;watcher-of-the-skies-when-a-new-planet&#x27; stuff, it was when I read the first Flashman.&quot;

The first &quot;Flashman&quot; sequel was &quot;Royal Flash&quot;. It was published in 1970, the same year that Fraser published &quot;The General Danced at Dawn&quot;, a series of short stories which fictionalised his post-war military experience as the adventures of &quot;Dand&quot; MacNeill in a Scottish Highland regiment. The following year Fraser published a third Flashman, &quot;Flash for Freedom!&quot;, as well as a non-fiction work, &quot;The Steel Bonnets&quot; (1971), a history of the Border Reivers of the Anglo-Scottish Border.

The film rights to &quot;Flashman&quot; were bought by Richard Lester, who was unable to get the film funded but hired Fraser to write the screenplay for &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; in Christmas 1972. This would be turned into two films, &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot;, both popular at the box office, and it launched Fraser as a screenwriter.

Following &quot;Flashman at the Charge&quot; (1973), Fraser wrote the screenplay for the movie &quot;Royal Flash&quot; (1975), also directed by Richard Lester. It was not a success at the box office.

There was another collection of Dand McNeill stories, &quot;McAuslan in the Rough&quot; (1974), then &quot;Flashman in the Great Game&quot; (1975) and &quot;Flashman&#x27;s Lady&quot; (1977). He was hired to rewrite &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; (1977) and &quot;Force 10 from Navarone&quot; (1978). The latter was directed by Guy Hamilton who arranged for Fraser to do some work on the script for &quot;Superman&quot; (1978). He did some uncredited work on the film &quot;Ashanti&quot; and wrote an unused script for &quot;Tai Pan&quot; to star Steve McQueen. He also wrote a biopic of General Stilwell for Martin Ritt which was not filmed.

Fraser tried a more serious historical novel with &quot;Mr American&quot; (1980), although Flashman still appeared in it. &quot;Flashman and the Redskins&quot; (1982) was a traditional Flashman and &quot;The Pyrates&quot; (1983) was a comic novel about pirates. He was one of several writers who worked on the James Bond film &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983). Richard Fleischer arranged for him to do work on the script for &quot;Red Sonja&quot; (1985).

After &quot;Flashman and the Dragon&quot; (1985) he was reunited with Lester on &quot;The Return of the Musketeers&quot; (1988) then released a final volume of McAuslan stories, &quot;The Sheikh and the Dustbin&quot; (1988) and did another history, &quot;The Hollywood History of the World&quot; (1988). When that film book came out he was reportedly working on a science fiction film &quot;Colossus&quot; and adapting Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Lost World&quot; for TV but neither project was filmed.

Following &quot;Flashman and the Mountain of Light&quot; (1990), Fraser wrote a version of The Lone Ranger for John Landis which ended up not being filmed. He did his memoirs of his experiences during World War II, &quot;Quartered Safe Out Here&quot; (1992).

He wrote a short novel about the Border Reivers of the 16th century, &quot;The Candlemass Road&quot; (1993), then &quot;Flashman and the Angel of the Lord&quot; (1994) and &quot;Black Ajax&quot; (1997), a novel about Tom Molineaux, which featured Flashman&#x27;s father as a support character.

&quot;Flashman and the Tiger&quot; (1999) consisted of three different Flashman stories. &quot;The Light&#x27;s on at Signpost&quot; (2002) was a second volume of memoirs, focusing on Fraser&#x27;s adventures in Hollywood and his criticisms of modern-day Britain. The latter could also be found in &quot;Flashman on the March&quot; (2005), the final Flashman, and &quot;The Reavers&quot; (2007), a comic novel about the Border Reivers in the style of &quot;The Pyrates&quot;.

Following his death a novel was discovered amongst his papers, &quot;Captain in Calico&quot;. This was published in 2015.

==Honours==
Fraser was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1999 Birthday Honours for services to literature. A traditionalist, he was an Honorary Member of the British Weights and Measures Association, which opposes compulsory conversion to the metric system.

==Family==
Fraser married Kathleen Hetherington in 1949. They had three children, Simon (Sie), Caroline, and Nicholas. He had eight grandchildren. He was a supporter of Glasgow football team Partick Thistle.

Fraser died in Douglas on 2 January 2008 from cancer, aged 82.

===Short stories===
The &quot;Dand MacNeill&quot; or &quot;McAuslan&quot; stories is a series of semi-autobiographical short stories based on the author&#x27;s experiences in the Gordon Highlanders, in North Africa and Scotland, soon after World War II. Some of the stories were originally bylined &quot;by Dand MacNeill&quot;, a play on the regimental motto BYDAND, meaning standfast:
*&quot;The General Danced at Dawn&quot; (1970)
*&quot;McAuslan in the Rough&quot; (1974)
*&quot;The Sheikh and the Dustbin&quot; (1988)
*&quot;The Complete McAuslan&quot; (2000) (All the stories in the three volumes, with a new introduction.)

===History===
*&quot;The Steel Bonnets&quot; (1971), a history of the Border Reivers of the Anglo-Scottish Border.
*&quot;The Hollywood History of the World: From One Million Years B.C. to Apocalypse Now&quot; (1988, revised 1996) The book discusses how Hollywood deals with history. It concludes that the standard of historical analysis in most movies is far better than one might imagine. The text is illustrated by comparative images of figures from history and the actors who portrayed them in film.

===Memoirs===
*&quot;Quartered Safe Out Here&quot; (1992), a memoir of his experiences as an infantryman in the Border Regiment during the Burma campaign of World War II
*&quot;The Light&#x27;s on at Signpost&quot; (2002), a memoir of the author&#x27;s days writing in Hollywood, interspersed with criticism of political correctness and New Labour.

===Other novels===
*&quot;Mr American&quot; (1980), a novel about a mysterious American in England.
*&quot;The Pyrates&quot; (1983), a tongue-in-cheek novel incorporating all the possible buccaneer film plots into one.
*&quot;Black Ajax&quot; (1997), a novel about Tom Molineaux, a 19th-century black prizefighter in England. (As in &quot;Mr American&quot;, this novel is also connected to the Flashman series—in this case Sir Harry Flashman&#x27;s father plays a minor role.)
*&quot;The Candlemass Road&quot; (1993), a short novel about the Border Reivers of the 16th century.
*&quot;The Reavers&quot; (2007), a comic novel of the Border Reivers, loosely based on the &quot;Candlemass Road&quot;, in the style of his earlier novel &quot;The Pyrates.&quot;
*&quot;Captain in Calico&quot; (2015), a novel posthumously issued.

===Screenplays===
Fraser wrote or co-wrote the screenplays for:
* &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1973)
* &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot; (1974)
* &quot;Royal Flash&quot; (1975, adapted from his novel)
* &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; (1977)
* &quot;Force 10 from Navarone&quot; (uncredited, 1978)
* &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983)
* &quot;Red Sonja&quot; (1985)
* &quot;The Return of the Musketeers&quot; (1989)

===Radio===
Fraser adapted &quot;The Candlemass Road&quot;, &quot;Flash for Freedom&quot; and &quot;Flashman at the Charge&quot; for BBC radio plays. Fraser was also a staunch critic of political correctness and enlarged upon his views on this matter (and others) on the BBC radio show, &quot;Desert Island Discs.&quot;

==Popular culture==
Fraser&#x27;s &quot;Flashman at the Charge&quot; (1973) was serialised in the April and June 1973 issues of &quot;Playboy&quot;. The climactic sequence of &quot;Flashman in the Great Game&quot; (1975) was also excerpted there.

There is a &quot;Flashman Pub&quot; in Monte Carlo named after the main character in his Flashman series of books. There was another one in South Africa and a number of Flashman appreciation societies in North America.

He starred as Al Borland in the ABC series &quot;Home Improvement&quot; and as Fred Peters in the Hulu series &quot;Pen15&quot;. Karn was also the fourth host of &quot;Family Feud&quot; from 2002 to 2006.

== Early life ==
Richard Karn Wilson was born in Seattle, Washington, on February 17, 1956. His father, Gene, was a Seabee who served in World War II. Richard graduated from Roosevelt High School and the University of Washington Professional Actor Training Program, where he was a member of Beta Theta Pi. Karn also gained drama experience in Scotland at the Edinburgh Festival.

After earning his drama degree in 1979, Karn moved to New York City, where in less than a week he was hired to do a commercial for Michelob beer that was featured during Super Bowl XIV. When Karn joined the Screen Actors Guild, he was informed there was already a Richard Wilson, prompting him to drop his surname.

== Career ==

In 1989, Karn&#x27;s wife, Tudi, convinced him to move to Los Angeles. Karn found a place for them to live by managing an apartment complex, catering events at a Jewish synagogue on the side. After receiving a traffic citation, Karn attended a traffic school and sat beside an agent who told him about casting for the new television show &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. The role of Al Borland had already been given to Stephen Tobolowsky, but when taping was scheduled, Tobolowsky was busy with another movie and the role had to be recast. Karn was a guest star in the pilot episode but became a regular cast member when the show was picked up by the network.

In 2002, Karn replaced Louie Anderson as the fourth individual to host the game show &quot;Family Feud&quot;. He left &quot;Family Feud&quot; in 2006 and was replaced by John O&#x27;Hurley.

In 2002, Karn made an appearance in The Strokes&#x27; music video for &quot;Someday&quot;, which featured segments of the band on a fictional showing of &quot;Family Feud&quot; against the band Guided by Voices.

On October 6, 2008, Karn replaced Patrick Duffy as host of Game Show Network&#x27;s &quot;Bingo America&quot;. He also served as a substitute host on GSN Radio.

Karn did commercials for Orchard Supply Hardware in the 1990s.

== Personal life ==
Karn has been married to actress Tudi Roche since 1985. They have a son named Cooper, who was born on March 4, 1992.

From 1994 to 1999, Karn hosted an annual celebrity golf tournament in Seattle. In July 2002, the Karn Invitational celebrity golf event was held at Echo Falls Golf Club in Snohomish, Washington.

<text>The Guggenheim family ( ) is an American-Jewish family known for making their fortune in the mining industry, in the early 20th century, especially in the United States and South America. After World War I, many family members withdrew from the businesses and became involved in philanthropy, especially in the arts, aviation, medicine, and culture.

== History ==
Meyer Guggenheim, a Swiss citizen of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, arrived in the United States in 1847. His surname derived from the name of the Alsatian village of Gougenheim. He married Barbara Meyer, whom he met in the United States. Over the next few decades, their 11 children and their descendants became known for global successes in mining and smelting businesses, under the name Guggenheim Exploration, including the American Smelting and Refining Company. In the early 20th century, the family amassed one of the largest fortunes in the world.

Following World War I, it sold its global mining interests and later purchased nitrate mines in Chile. Subsequently, the family largely withdrew from direct involvement in running businesses. Family members became known for their philanthropy in diverse areas such as modern art, aviation, and medicine. They donated funds to develop Guggenheim Museums, the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory, and the Guggenheim Pavilion at Mount Sinai Medical Center, designed by I. M. Pei in New York City.

== Current interests ==
Peter Lawson-Johnston, a British Guggenheim descendant, founded Guggenheim Partners which today (2023) manages over $300 billion in assets. Another family vehicle, Guggenheim Investment Advisors, oversees about $50 billion in assets.

== Family tree ==

<text>Ecdysone is a prohormone of the major insect molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone, secreted from the prothoracic glands. It is of steroidal structure. Insect molting hormones (ecdysone and its homologues) are generally called ecdysteroids. Ecdysteroids act as moulting hormones of arthropods but also occur in other related phyla where they can play different roles. In &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, an increase in ecdysone concentration induces the expression of genes coding for proteins that the larva requires. It causes chromosome puffs (sites of high expression) to form in polytene chromosomes. Recent findings in the laboratory of Chris Q. Doe have found a novel role of this hormone in regulating temporal gene transitions within neural stem cells of the fruit fly. 

Ecdysone and other ecdysteroids also appear in many plants mostly as a protection agent (toxins or antifeedants) against herbivorous insects. These phytoecdysteroids have been reputed to have medicinal value. They are part of herbal adaptogenic remedies like Cordyceps, yet an ecdysteroid precursor in plants has been shown to have cytotoxic properties as well as antioxidant properties on lipid peroxidation.

Tebufenozide, sold under the Bayer trademark MIMIC, has ecdysteroid activity although its chemical structure has little resemblance to the ecdysteroids.

<doc id="420625" wikidata="Q4348958" url="?curid=420625" title="Miles Glacier Bridge">
<text>The Miles Glacier Bridge, also known as the Million Dollar Bridge, was built in the early 1900s across the Copper River fifty miles from Cordova in what is now the U.S. state of Alaska. It is a multiple-span Pennsylvania truss bridge which completed a railroad line for the Copper River and Northwestern Railway, built by J. P. Morgan and the Guggenheim family to haul copper from the old mining town of Kennicott, now located within the Wrangell–St. Elias National Park and Preserve, to the port of Cordova. It earned its nickname because of its $1.4 million cost, well recouped by the about $200 million worth of copper ore which was shipped as a result of its construction.

Current access to the bridge is limited to jet boat travel up the Copper River or boat travel downriver from Chitina due to the erosion along the Copper River Highway, and there is currently no access by road. The cost of repairs has prevented necessary maintenance albeit Miles Glacier bridge remains an attraction for tourists.

== History ==
The Copper River and Northwestern Railway and associated bridges were built between 1906 and 1911 by Michael James Heney. This bridge was the most significant of the group. However, its use as a railroad bridge ended in 1938 when the Copper River and Northwestern Railway shut down.

Work to convert the old rail bed into a highway bridge was completed in 1958. In the same year, a plaque was placed on the bridge:

This Bridge once served the Copper River and Northwestern Railroad trains, and was converted to a Highway Bridge in 1958. The Bridge crosses the Copper River between two scenic and active glaciers. The Childs Glacier to the west and the Miles Glacier to the east. Known as the Million Dollar Bridge, and constructed during severe winter conditions. It was considered one of the great engineering feats of all time.
The bridge was among many affected by the 1964 Alaska earthquake – while other bridges along the Copper River Highway from Cordova to Chitina were destroyed, the Million Dollar Bridge was &quot;merely damaged&quot;. One of the bridge spans, #4, slipped off its foundation after the earthquake.

The bridge was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

==Features==
The bridge at Mile 49 needed to span 1,500 feet of the Copper River between two glaciers on either bank. Ice calving from the Miles Glacier meant the bridge needed to withstand icebergs, up to 20 feet in height, moving with the 7.2 miles per hour current. Additionally, the river ranged 24 feet in height. The bed of the river was loose sand and gravel to a depth of 20 feet.

The site was selected in 1907 and the bridge would have four spans, #1 at 400 feet, #2 at 300 feet, #3 at 450 feet and #4 at 400 feet, mounted on three piers. The piers would be placed on bars out of the way of most ice. Piers #1 and #2 required detached icebreakers. Excavation of the piers and icebreakers was accomplished through the use of caissons. The track reached the bridge site in Oct. 1908. Actual bridge construction started on 5 April 1909 with span #1 completed in 10.5 days, span #2 in 6 days, span #3 in 10 days and span #4 was completed a month later. The bridge was in full service by July 1910.

==Repairs==
Temporary repairs, consisting of a rudimentary system of cables, I-beams, and planks, kept the bridge passable after the 1964 earthquake. The bridge was permanently repaired starting in 2004, and the repaired bridge was dedicated in August 2005. The controversial decision was made to repair it after a severe September 1995 flood caused the bridge to be impassable and also made an eventual washout of debris onto Childs Glacier inevitable. State engineers determined that it was less expensive to repair the bridge than it would be to remove it, or (in a worst-case scenario) clean up if the bridge completely collapsed into the river. Such a cleanup would have been required due to the Copper River salmon runs. The repairs cost $16 million in federal and $3 million in state tax dollars.

In August 2016, a large iceberg struck the icebreaker protecting the bridge’s first pier. The damaged icebreaker was moved downstream during a high water event in 2019, and offers no protection to the first pier.

<doc id="420628" wikidata="Q6116208" url="?curid=420628" title="Jackie Ballard">
<text>Jacqueline Margaret Ballard (née Mackenzie; born 4 January 1953) has been a charity senior manager, politician and journalist in the United Kingdom. She served as Liberal Democrat MP for Taunton from 1997 to 2001.

Her former roles include Director General of the RSPCA, Chief Executive of RNID and Chief Executive of Womankind Worldwide.

==Early career==
Jacqueline Margaret Mackenzie was born in Dunoon, Scotland. Her family moved, when she was 10, to South Wales, where she studied at Haberdashers&#x27; Monmouth School for Girls. She then read social psychology at the London School of Economics. She was recruited into the then Liberal Party by Paddy Ashdown and was elected a Councillor for both the South Somerset District Council (1987–1991) and Somerset County Council (1993–1997). She stood as the Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate in Taunton in the 1992 general election, coming second, before winning the seat in 1997.

==MP for Taunton==
Ballard was elected the Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Taunton in Somerset, at the 1997 general election, unseating the incumbent MP David Nicholson (Conservative) by 2,443 votes and a swing of 4.6%. She was the first Liberal MP for Taunton since the 1922 general election.

During her time as an MP, Ballard was a vocal and prominent campaigner against blood sports, in particular fox and stag hunting. Ballard came under considerable pressure due to her stance, once having to receive police protection during a constituency surgery which was lobbied by hunt supporters. It has been suggested that her work with regards to this ban contributed to her losing her seat, which prepared the way for her role as CEO of the RSPCA.

In Parliament, she was spokesperson on Women&#x27;s Issues and on Local Government from 1997 to 1999, and from 1999 to 2001, was Deputy Home Affairs Spokesman. She was also co-sponsor of the first bill which attempted to ban fox hunting, which is widely seen as an important factor in her defeat at the 2001 election. She stood for the post of leader of the Liberal Democrats in 1999, but was defeated by Charles Kennedy, and came fourth out of five candidates. She lost her seat at the 2001 general election by 235 votes, to the Conservative candidate Adrian Flook.

==Iran==
After losing her seat in 2001, Ballard spent some time studying in Iran.&quot;I was lucky enough to have £25,000 redundancy money and no dependants and I realised that for the first time in my life, at the age of 48, I was free. I am divorced, my daughter had just graduated and started work and my mother, although not always in the best of health, did not need me to look after her. I decided to combine two of my passions and to pursue something completely different...I am now on my fifth visit to the country [Iran], researching and writing my thesis while learning the language, Farsi (referring to Persian).&quot;

She wrote about her experience of the chador as a western woman in Iran.&quot;I wonder how the media might have treated Ann Widdecombe or Blair&#x27;s so called &#x27;babes&#x27; if all women MPs here wore the uniform of the chador. Perhaps then the women in Parliament would be taken more seriously as professional politicians doing a job, not as fat or thin women in grey or pink suits. Maybe then I would not have been described by some witty journalist as having &#x27;a good face for radio&#x27; or be told by the late Auberon Waugh that I was &#x27;too fat to be an MP&#x27;.&quot;

==Career after Westminster==
In September 2002, she was appointed Director General of the RSPCA. To solve the financial problems the RSPCA was facing, she made substantial changes including 300 job cuts. By 2004 the RSPCA had balanced its books and made £7 million savings.

Ballard was appointed Chief Executive of the RNID in October 2007. She was appointed as the Chief Executive of Womankind Worldwide in September 2012 but stepped down from the role after only ten months in June 2013.

In December 2009, Ballard was appointed to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority which supervises MPs&#x27; expenses. She was one of four members of IPSA who announced in December 2012 that they would not seek reappointment, citing disputes with speaker John Bercow.

She was interviewed in 2014 as part of The History of Parliament&#x27;s oral history project.

==Personal life==
She was married to Derek Ballard from 1975 to 1989. She has one daughter.

<text>Jan Frederik Gronovius (also seen as Johann Frederik and Johannes Fredericus) (10 February 1690 in Leiden – 10 July 1762 in Leiden) was a Dutch botanist notable as a patron of Linnaeus.

John Clayton, a plant collector in Virginia sent him many specimens, as well as manuscript descriptions, in the 1730s. Without Clayton&#x27;s knowledge, Gronovius used the material in his &quot;Flora Virginica&quot; (1739–43, 2nd ed. 1762).

He was the son of Jakob Gronovius and grandson of Johann Friedrich Gronovius, both classical scholars. In 1719, he married Margaretha Christina Trigland, who died in 1726, and Johanna Susanna Alensoon in 1729. His son Laurens Theodoor Gronovius (1730–1777) was also a botanist.

<text>Gerald Edward Bermingham (20 August 1940 – 2 August 2023) was a British politician and barrister who was a Labour Member of Parliament for St Helens South from 1983 until 2001.

Bermingham was born 20 August 1940 in Dublin, Ireland, and educated at Cotton College, Wellingborough Grammar School and Sheffield University, where he obtained a degree in law. He was admitted as a solicitor in 1967, and was called to the Bar (Gray&#x27;s Inn) in 1985. He was a Sheffield City councillor from 1975 to 1979. He contested South East Derbyshire in 1979, but was defeated by the incumbent Conservative Peter Rost.

In 1994, he was one of six Labour MPs who voted against any reduction in the age of consent for homosexuals, even to 18 (at the time, the age of consent was 21).

On his retirement, he was succeeded by Shaun Woodward, a Conservative defector, who swapped his old seat of Witney to represent the ultra-safe St Helens South.

Bermingham died in Birmingham on 2 August 2023, at the age of 82.

==Legal career==
Bermingham continued to practise from No 5 Chambers, a Birmingham barristers&#x27; chambers, in the field of criminal law.

<text>Alice Thomas Ellis (born Ann Margaret Lindholm, 9 September 1932 – 8 March 2005) was a British writer and essayist born in Liverpool. She wrote numerous novels and some non-fiction, including cookery books.

==Life==
Ellis was born in Liverpool to John and Alexandra Lindholm. John was half Finnish, and Alexandra half Welsh. She spent part of her childhood as a World War II evacuee in North Wales, a period she wrote about in &quot;A Welsh Childhood.&quot; Thomas Ellis was educated at Bangor Grammar School and then entered the Liverpool School of Art. A member of the Church of Humanity, Ellis converted to Catholicism at age 19. She then dropped out of art school and spent six months in a convent. However, after she suffered a slipped disc, the religious order expelled her as unable to do physical labour.

In the 1950s she moved to Chelsea in London, where she embraced a Bohemian lifestyle and became known for wearing black. She was working in a coffee shop when she met Colin Haycraft. The couple married in 1956 and eventually had seven children. Their daughter Mary died two days after birth. Their son Joshua spent ten months in a coma after falling off a roof, dying at age 19 in 1978. Ellis dedicated her poem &quot;The Birds of the Air&quot; to Joshua, with the inscription:
:All his beauty, wit and grace
:Lie forever in one place.
:He who sang and sprang and moved
:Now, in death, is only loved.

In 1968, Haycraft and a partner bought Gerald Duckworth and Company, a publishing house in London. Ellis became its fiction editor. Her most famous client was Beryl Bainbridge, who worked with Ellis for many years. The author Clare Colvin, in Ellis&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, described her skills as an editor:She combined a novelist&#x27;s imagination with an editor&#x27;s forensic skills, getting immediately to the heart of the problem, with an observation such as, &quot;Lovely characters, darling, but where&#x27;s the plot?&quot;

Her first novel, &quot;The Sin Eater&quot; (1977) appeared under the pseudonym Alice Thomas Ellis, which she used in all her later writing. Probably her best-known novel, &quot;Unexplained Laughter&quot; (1985), was adapted for UK television, as was her &quot;Summerhouse Trilogy&quot;. Her novel &quot;The 27th Kingdom&quot; (1982) was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. In a &quot;New York Times&quot; article, Margalit Fox described her work:Shot through with melancholy, Ms. Ellis&#x27;s novels focus on the small savageries, deep discontents and abiding grief of women&#x27;s lives. Yet they are also mordantly funny sendups of bourgeois manners. Sometimes, as in the work of Shirley Jackson, the gothic overlays the domestic, to unsettling effect. Many of Ms. Ellis&#x27;s characters are repellent, and they are meant to be. Ellis&#x27;s cookery books include &quot;All-natural Baby Food&quot; (Fontana/Collins, 1977) and &quot;Darling, you shouldn&#x27;t have gone to so much trouble&quot;, co-written with Caroline Blackwood. Blackwood and her poet husband, Robert Lowell, were frequent visitors to the Haycraft home.

Her &quot;Home Life&quot; column in &quot;The Spectator&quot; was republished in four volumes. All her work was livened by a dry, dark sense of humour. As she put it, &quot;There is no reciprocity. Men love women. Women love children. Children love hamsters. Hamsters don&#x27;t love anyone&quot;.

As a conservative Roman Catholic, Ellis disliked the Second Vatican Council changes in church practices. In one book, she described them as &quot;tide of sewage&quot; and &quot;Protestantized happy-clappy stuff.&quot; She was a sharp critic of what she saw as abuses of liturgy and practice that watered down the faith. She claimed that since the change from the Tridentine Mass, she could barely bring herself to attend church on Sundays. Though her fiction often seems feminist, with women usually the leads, she opposed what she viewed as radical feminist activism in the Church. As a regular columnist of the &quot;Catholic Herald&quot; newspaper, Ellis in 1996 criticised Derek Worlock, the former Archbishop of Liverpool, shortly after his death, accusing him of responsibility for a strong fall in church attendance in the previous decade. Infuriated by her comments, Cardinal Hume pressed the &quot;Catholic Herald&quot; to restrict her columns to cookery.

In 1995, Ellis&#x27;s husband died, after which she moved from London to their farmhouse in Powys, Wales. She became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1999. She was treated for lung cancer in 2003 and died of it on 8 March 2005, at the age of 72.

Public IEK (DIEK) is also known as State IEK (DIEK), State Institute of Vocational Training (DIEK), that was renamed State SAEK (DSAEK), State School of Advanced Vocational Training (DSAEK). 

There are approx. 90 regional Public IEK (Greek: ) in the administrative regions of Greece, and also over 50 Private IEK (Greek: IIEK) administrated by EOPPEP entity, recognized by the Ministry of Education. Additionally, they also exist public IEKs of Ministry of Tourism at which has hospitality and tourism specialties; of National Center for Emergency Care (EKAV); of Ministry of Health; of Public Employment Service (DYPA); of Hellenic Agricultural Organization – DEMETER of the Ministry of Rural Development and Food. There is also the IIEK Energy Institute of the Public Power Corporation (DEI) in Kozani.

IEK students are being assessed during the semester in the form of progress test (), and the final examination test () taken and the end of the semester. In prior years the Institute of Vocational Training (IEK) was also offered the IEK post lower secondary programmes that have been abolished, where access in them had the students that have completed the gymnasium school.

==Admission== 
Admission into an IEK’s programme requires adult-only applicants who have graduated from upper secondary education school in Greece&lt;ref name=&quot;Law 4386/2016 Government Gazette 83/Α/11-05-2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Law 4186/2013 Government Gazette 193/A/17-9-2013&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Law 4250/2014 Government Gazette 74/Α/26-3-2014&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; at National Qualification Framework (NQF) of Greece Level 4 (EQF 4; lyceum) or its international equivalent officially recognized by the Greek Ministry of Education.

Admission into a public IEK’s programme is selective, subject to fulfilling the entry criteria. It has to be granted on the basis of the upper secondary leaving certificate grade and other criteria include age, the social insurance stamps of applicants having prior employment relevant to the subject of the study applied for, and specific criteria on an individual basis will be assessed. All public IEKs are government-funded have free education, without any payment of tuition fee.

The VAT number (, registration code for tax purposes) and SSRN (AMKA, Social Security Registration Number) are required from the student for its admission. Since its foundation in 1992, public IEKs were required by law from their students to pay up to €367 statutory tuition each semester until the 2012-2013 academic year, but has been apolished since the 2013-2014 academic year by Law 4186/2013, Chapter IV, Article 23(2), Government Gazette 193/Α/17-9-2013.

The maximum number of students that can register in a given IEK Apprenticeship programme is up to thirty (30).

<doc id="420656" wikidata="Q7016295" url="?curid=420656" title="New Zealand pea crab">
<text>The New Zealand pea crab (Nepinnotheres novaezelandiae), is a species of small, parasitic crab that lives most commonly inside New Zealand green-lipped mussels. Adult females are about the size and shape of a pea, while adult males are smaller and flatter. Adult New Zealand pea crabs are completely reliant on their host mussel for shelter and food, which it steals from the mussel&#x27;s gills. The New Zealand pea crab is found throughout New Zealand and can infect up to 70% of natural populations. These crabs are of concern to green-lipped mussel aquaculture because they reduce the size and growth of mussels, although infected mussels can be harvested and consumed.

== Taxonomy ==
This species was first described and named by Henri Filhol in 1885 as &quot;Pinnotheres&quot; &quot;novae-zelandiae&quot; and in 1901 as &quot;Pinnotheres schauinslandi&quot; (a junior synonym) by H. Lenz. It was later assigned to the genus &quot;Nepinnotheres&quot;.

==Description==

Adult female New Zealand pea crabs have a soft-shelled exoskeleton. Their carapace is oval in shape, ranging in size from wide. Sexually mature adult females almost always have eggs that are tucked under their abdomens, giving them a more spherical appearance. Adult females are opaque white in colour. Developing eggs change colour from red to orange to yellow before they hatch, giving the brooding mother a different tint at each stage. Adult male New Zealand pea crabs have a hard, chitinous exoskeleton. Their carapace is smaller and more dorso-ventrally flattened than that of the female, ranging in size from wide. Adult males are a creamy white colour with distinctive orange markings.
==Ecology==
Female New Zealand pea crabs spend their entire adult lives within a single host. Adult males will only leave their host in order to find a mate. The hard exoskeleton and flattened body shape of the male New Zealand pea crab helps with this endeavour. New Zealand pea crabs are completely reliant on their host for food, shelter and a place to mate. The New Zealand pea crab collects food by sitting on the gills of the green-lipped mussel and stealing food strands from the mussel. The relationship between the New Zealand pea crab and the green-lipped mussel is one of parasitism because the crab damages the mussel&#x27;s gills when taking food. Infected mussels are also smaller and slower growing than uninfected mussels.

The New Zealand pea crab is endemic to New Zealand and is common throughout the country, inhabiting the North Island, South Island, Stewart Island and the Chatham Islands. The New Zealand pea crab lives most commonly in green-lipped mussels (&quot;Perna canaliculus&quot;), but can also be found in many other bivalve molluscs including the blue mussel (&quot;Mytilus edulis aoteanus&quot;), the Pacific oyster (&quot;Crassostrea gigas&quot;) and a species of clam (&quot;Chione stutchburyi&quot;). The infection rate in wild green-lipped mussel populations can range from 0 to 70%.

==Behaviour==
In a 2015 study, the mate location behaviour of male New Zealand pea crabs was observed when dwelling in the commercially important green-lipped mussel, &quot;Perna canaliculus&quot;. Given the cryptic behaviour of the male crabs, a novel trapping system was developed to determine whether male crabs would exit their mussel hosts in response to an upstream female crab. Observations of the nocturnal mate-finding behaviour of male crabs were made in darkness using infrared video recordings. The presence of receptive female crabs placed upstream successfully attracted 60% of male crabs from their host over 24 h. Males spent on average 49 min on empty hosts and never left a mussel containing a female conspecific once found, spending 200 min on average to gain entry to the mussel. Male crabs were often observed stroking the mantle edge of the mussel whilst attempting to gain entry, successfully increasing mussel valve gape during entry from 3.7 to 5.5 mm. The authors concluded that a pheromone-based mate location system is likely used by this crab to greatly reduce the risks associated with the location of females.

==Aquaculture==
Mussels infected by pea crabs are edible, with the New Zealand pea crab infecting between 5.3% to 70% of natural mussel populations. These crabs are of concern to green-lipped mussel aquaculture because they reduce the size and growth of mussels by up to 29%.

<doc id="420659" wikidata="Q7899477" url="?curid=420659" title="Upward Bound">
<text>Upward Bound is a federally funded educational program within the United States. The program is one of a cluster of programs now referred to as TRiO, all of which owe their existence to the federal Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 (the War on Poverty Program) and the Higher Education Act of 1965. Upward Bound programs are implemented and monitored by the United States Department of Education. The goal of Upward Bound is to provide certain categories of high school students better opportunities for attending college. The categories of greatest concern are those with low income, those with parents who did not attend college, and those living in rural areas. The program works through individual grants, each of which covers a restricted geographic area and provides services to approximately 59,000 students annually. The program focuses on academic and nonacademic resources and activities like visits to museums or tutoring for school work. Students are encouraged to be involved in Upward Bound for the entire academic year and a 6-week long summer program. Many students who are also granted access into the Upward Bound program are labeled as first generation college students, who are students that are the first in their family to attend college. This program is set in place for students who come from low income families as well as underrepresented schools and gives them an opportunity to excel in college.

== History ==
The program was launched in the summer of 1965 after the passage of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 (The Federal War on Poverty) during President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s administration, and was transferred to the Department of Education after the enactment of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The idea of Upward Bound came from Stan Salett, a civil rights organizer, national education policy advisor and one of the creators of the Head Start Program. The experimental program was established as the country’s first federal program to prepare low income students for college with the goal of helping high school students go from poverty to the middle class through higher education. In 1965, 17 Regular Upward Bound programs enrolled 2,601 participants. Since 1964 more than 2 million students have participated in Regular Upward Bound and 964 programs are funded with more than 80,000 students participating. Then in 1990, Upward Bound added an additional program called the Upward Bound Math-Science Program. It specializes in math and science skills for TRiO eligible students to improve their performance and motivation to pursue postsecondary enrollment. The 2017-18 annual data collected by the Department of Education on the Upward Bound Program reveals that currently, 84,934 participants were in the program and being served, this number includes the 13,392 who are in the Upward Bound Math-Science Program. 

== Funding ==
Grants are usually made to institutes of higher education (universities), but some awards have been made to other non-profit organizations such as tribal organizations. The Upward Bound Program selects those universities and organizations who receive grant funding based on their competitive criteria: Those applicants who demonstrate a Rationale; Applicants who meet student’s social, emotional, and academic needs; and strengthens cross-agency coordination and community engagement to advance systematic change. Upward Bound grants are results-based, with the level of success determined largely from highly structured annual reports compared to grant objectives. As of Fiscal Year 2020, Upward Bound had an annual budget around $352,000,000.
Each award made averages $4,691 per participant, with the most common award providing $220,000 per grantee in 2004 and $250,000 in 2007. Awards are for four or five years and are competitive. The law providing for Upward Bound is 34 CFR Ch. VI Pt. 645. As federal education grants, Upward Bound awards fall under EDGAR and OMB Circular A-21 financial guidelines.

The program is available to students after their eighth grade of school. Two-thirds of selected applicants must be low-income and &quot;potential first-generation college students,&quot; with the remaining third of students meeting one of the aforementioned criteria.

== Approach ==
Upward Bound programs may utilize two approaches to student preparation: 

1. A summer program where high school students take college preparatory classes and earn work experience at a college campus for four to six weeks. 
Methodologies vary among summer programs, such as one based on Lancelot Hogben&#x27;s social usefulness method as applied in the 1980s by an Upward Bound Astronomy program for Los Angeles County high school students, that subsequently evolved into a low-tech and low-cost method by Dr Daniel Barth at Mount San Jacinto College. 
2. Weekly academic instruction and possibly tutoring with students throughout the school year. 
In the latter case, Upward Bound Programs are primarily located at various universities across the United States according to the demographic makeup of the localities served. However, when it comes to the activities and workshops offered many universities share them with community colleges. For example at East Tennessee State University, located in Johnson City, Tennessee, the school offers students the ability to enter into individual counseling sessions, ACT preparation courses; as well as participate in cultural events, field trips and classes in typical academic subjects. Likewise, at Washington State University, located in Pullman, Washington, the institution offers similar workshops and activities such as: basic academic subjects, SAT &amp; ACT preparation courses, academic advising and tutoring; as well as cultural enrichment activities and individualized support. Furthermore, at the University of Central Florida (UCF), in Orlando, Florida, the school breaks down its Upward Bound Program into three sub-programs, with a great number of activities being offered in all three. These activities and workshops include: tutoring, basic academic classes, study skills, college readiness, cultural events, career exploration assistance, and college admission application assistance, just to name a few. Whatever the location or demographic makeup, the goal across them all is the same: to help better prepare those in high school for academic success at the college level, as well as to get better results on Advanced Placement tests taken while the students taking the exams are still in high school.

== Upward Bound Math-Science Program ==
In 1990, Upward Bound added an additional program called the Upward Bound Math-Science Program. It specializes in math and science skills for TRiO eligible students to improve their performance and motivation to pursue postsecondary enrollment. The Upward Bound Math-Science program (UBMS) was created for students to have the opportunity to excel in the areas of math and science. Upward Bound Math-Science helps strengthen students&#x27; math and science skills, particularly those who come from areas that are underdeveloped. UBMS is a program that was put in place by the federal government and was there to provide not so fortunate children with the opportunity to gain knowledge from mathematicians as well as scientists who have experience in these fields. Students are in this program for 6 weeks and have coursework in mathematics and laboratory science, as well as literature. This program provides students with hands-on experience in labs and with fieldwork. The application process for UBMS is identical to that for Upward Bound, however the programs differ in that UBMS is more geared towards students who are interested in the fields of science and technology. UBMS increased the odds of a student taking a science course by raising the percentage from 78-88% in chemistry and from 43-58% in physics. UMBS has increased the likelihood that children will achieve more in math and science and increase that drive to further their interests in college. UBMS has also raised GPAs in math classes for African-Americans as well as Hispanics.

== Effectiveness ==

Several studies have shown that TRIO Upward Bound is tremendously successful. A study released by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) in 2004, provides a detailed analysis of program demographics. Notable alumni of Upward Bound programs include John Quiñones, Angela Bassett, José M. Hernández, Troy Polamalu, Emmy-winning Journalist Rick Blalock, Kenny Leon, Donna Brazile, Patrick Ewing, Henry Bonilla, Cardi B, LALA Castillo, Raphael Warnock, Oprah Winfrey and Viola Davis. Effectiveness varies from program 
to program, as local program directors determine the strategy most optimal vis-a-vis the student base, from being very strict and hands-on with students, to being more lenient in terms of student life and academic management. Students enrolled in Upward Bound were shown to be more likely to enroll in a four-year institution than students participating in comparable programs, and were also less likely to enroll in remedial courses. Unique aspects of the Upward Bound program include a summer immersion program conducted on college campuses. The program exposes students to college-level rigor, while also allowing students to enter university courses before high school completion bypassing the need for remedial classes upon beginning postsecondary education.

=== College Readiness ===
According to a study done by Policy and Program Studies Service of the United States Department of Education, in students with lower educational expectations, Upward Bound was shown to increase both enrollment and credits earned at four-year institutions. Repeated participation in Upward Bound until high school graduation was shown to improve educational results such as the rate of four-year college attendance and credits earned at four-year institutions. Students who were enrolled in the Upward Bound program were categorized into distinct groups based on the length of time they participated. The groups were low-duration (1 to 12 months of participation), medium-duration (13 to 24 months of participation) or high-duration (25 or more months of participation), and also as program completers (through graduation) or noncompleters. The results of the observational study showed that an additional year participating in Upward Bound can significantly improve students’ motivation and persistence to pursue higher education, apply for financial aid, apply for highly selective 4 year college programs, and complete higher education. Different effects were measured by looking at the data for noncompleters and the impact of completing the program. The rate at which the students would pursue postsecondary enrollment would increase from 74% to 91%. There are confounding variables in this study, mostly due to the characteristic of students who decide to stay involved in the program and therefore have higher educational expectations for themselves. The true effects of an additional year of participation may be lower than the actual findings. The researchers attempted to control for the variable by matching participants with similar characteristics and different duration of participation in the program. The general effect of Upward Bound is only significantly seen in 4-year colleges.

=== Higher Educational Pursuit ===
In an examination of the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002, collected by the National Center for Education Statistics, researchers found that only 7% of students eligible for federally funded precollege programs enrolled in such programs. They found that participating students were .576 times as likely not to enroll in a four-year institution and .555 times as likely not to enroll in a postsecondary institution of any kind compared to all eligible students. However, Upward Bound students were 31% more likely to drop out of the postsecondary institution in which they enrolled. Though some of the statistics reporting participants&#x27; outcome are not optimal, the students participating in Upward Bound are an academically vulnerable population. Therefore, these results do not necessitate that Upward Bound is a deficient program, but that the students may require more support than they receive.

Additionally, research at the Journal of Hispanic Higher Education suggests that Upward Bound programs can specifically help more (otherwise discouraged) Latino students pursue dreams of college. There are low rates of enrollment of Latino students due to discouraging factors like “policies that encourage quick job placement over career development, lack of understanding of the benefits of a college degree, lower expectations for Latino students, poor financial planning, and lack of guidance”, but Upward Bound programs should help combat them and support students. The key to these programs’ intervention is education and providing students the opportunities that come with a college education. As a result, it would motivate more students to go to college and encourage them that college is attainable. They would also offer more college preparation, guidance in college and help students plan to ensure they not only enroll at an institution but also graduate and find a career. A main drawback of these programs is that many students are unaware that they are available to them. Another one is that these programs should not just aim to get underprivileged students into college but facilitate them finishing. Furthermore, with the Latino population in this country growing, having more educated Latino students could help bring more revenue and benefit society as a whole.

=== Research Complications ===
Another research study done by the University of Wisconsin explains that many studies may have falsely suggested that Upward Bound programs are not meeting their mission of increasing the rate of college enrollment of underprivileged students. The researcher suggests there are actual methodical and analysis errors in other researchers&#x27; work and that these programs can close the success attainment gaps between students from different socio-economic statuses.

In response to misleading data being published on the efficacy of Upward Bound and Upward Bound Math and Science programs in 2009, the Pell Institute performed a re-analysis of positive impacts achieved by the programs. Data reported by the Pell Institute shows positive effects found in legislatively mandated programs. Upward Bound students were more likely to receive a bachelor&#x27;s degree than students receiving no or less thorough supplemental educational services. Of students participating in an Upward Bound program, three-quarters enrolled at a post-secondary educational institution within one year of their projected high school completion, as opposed to less than half of students without access to supplemental college services. One-fifth of Upward Bound students enrolled in post-secondary education completed a degree within six years of their high school graduation date, in contrast with less than one-tenth of students without supplemental services.

== Perceptions &amp; Annual Performance Reports ==

Much like the different approaches to the Upward Bound Programs across the United States, the perceptions of these programs differ as well. When it comes to the perception of how the Upward Bound Program is doing, the most valuable feedback comes from the participants in the program as well as the Parents of those children in the program. While little data exists documenting a collective set of feedback from students and parents about the Upward Bound Program, there is annual individual data from Universities documenting feedback. According to a quantitative and qualitative study of 20 participants of an Upward Bound program at a Midwestern community college, some students mentioned that they did not plan to attend college before they attended the Upward Bound program. Studied students received social and academic preparation and felt they received more social than academic preparation in the program.

=== Pima Community College- Desert Vista Campus ===
Pima Community Colleges Upward Bound Program gathered qualitative data about their program from students, teachers, as well as parents. The students and parents who were in the program, had been though the program, or interacted with the program were positive in their evaluations about the work the program was doing. This group also reported having difficulty when asked to identify ways in which Upward Bound could improve their programming. Amongst the strengths listed by the group were; the program is well-designed and well-organized, the program has unlocked a sense of motivation not only in students but parents as well, and the program was great at keeping parents aware of Upward Bound’s expectations.  

=== Stark State College ===
At Stark State College they found that students, following COVID Stay at Home Restrictions, voiced their preferences for in-person and hands-on training in STEM activities. Furthermore, they found 77% of students conducting an exit interview from the program rated College Connection tutorial/advising sessions as good or excellent. Several comments from students also stated some sessions felt repetitive and would have liked more fun/games in academic settings. Stark State College concluded that most reviews by students were rated good or excellent with comments mainly suggesting that there were too many learning activities and that they enjoyed field trips taken. When it comes to seniors exiting the program, they mainly rated their experience high and would be willing to come back to mentor high school students currently in the program. When it comes to the Parent Association created for their Upward Bound Program, many parents were involved in the activities and each year serve as chaperones for the student leadership conference(s). Furthermore, parents expressed their gratitude about the Programs success and the positive effects it is having on their youth.

=== University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill ===
In a study of parents of students of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&#x27;s Upward Bound program, the vast majority of parents reported that their children took more challenging classes and received better grades after attending the program. Parents reported that after the program, their children seemed to have better attitudes regarding their own educational attainment. Parents believed the program helped their children to foster personal integrity, self-assuredness, and ambition. Parents also believed that their children exhibited more mature behaviors, such as budgeting money and reliable communication.

=== Annual Performance Reports ===
Annual Performance Reports are an incredible way to gain an insight into how Upward Bound Programs are performing across the country. Many break down the expenses they’ve used as well as the awards and budget they are working with. Not only that, but most have informative feedback from different levels within the program that helps understand how to improve and what strengths programs like these above have. Many annual performance reports also contain the number of their students who graduate and obtain higher educational degrees. Many of these annual reports can also serve as a great way for those who are wanting to get involved with the Upward Bound Program, whether that be as a Parent looking to get their child involved or as a worker looking to find a job in the program.

<doc id="420661" wikidata="Q208132" url="?curid=420661" title="False killer whale">
<text>The false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens) is a species of oceanic dolphin that is the only extant representative of the genus &quot;Pseudorca&quot;. It is found in oceans worldwide but mainly in tropical regions. It was first described in 1846 as a species of porpoise based on a skull, which was revised when the first carcasses were observed in 1861. The name &quot;false killer whale&quot; comes from having a skull similar to the orca (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;), or killer whale.

The false killer whale reaches a maximum length of , though size can vary around the world. It is highly sociable, known to form pods of up to 50 members, and can also form pods with other dolphin species, such as the common bottlenose dolphin (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;). It can form close bonds with other species, as well as have sexual interactions with them. But the false killer whale has also been known to eat other dolphins, though it typically eats squid and fish. It is a deep-diver; maximum known depth is ; maximum speed is around .

Several aquariums around the world keep one or more false killer whales, though its aggression toward other dolphins makes it less desirable. It is threatened by fishing operations, as it can entangle in fishing gear. It is drive hunted in some Japanese villages. The false killer whale has a tendency to mass-strand given its highly social nature; the largest stranding consisted of over 800 beached at Mar del Plata, Argentina, in 1946. Most of what is known of this species comes from examining stranded individuals.

==Taxonomy==

The false killer whale was first described by British paleontologist and biologist Richard Owen in his 1846 book, &quot;A history of British fossil mammals and birds&quot;, based on a fossil skull discovered in 1843. This specimen was unearthed from the Lincolnshire Fens near Stamford in England, a subfossil deposited in a marine environment that existed around 126,000 years ago. The skull was reported as present in a number of museum collections, but noted as lost by William Henry Flower in 1884. Owen compared the skull to those of the long-finned pilot whale (&quot;Globicephala melas&quot;), beluga whale (&quot;Delphinapterus leucas&quot;), and Risso&#x27;s dolphin (&quot;Grampus griseus&quot;)–in fact, he gave it the nickname &quot;thick toothed grampus&quot; in light of this and assigned the animal to the genus &quot;Phocaena&quot; (a genus of porpoises) which Risso&#x27;s dolphin was also assigned to in 1846. The species name &quot;crassidens&quot; means &quot;thick toothed&quot;.

In 1846, zoologist John Edward Gray put the false killer whale in the genus &quot;Orcinus&quot;, which had been known as the killer whale (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;). Until 1861, when the first carcasses washed up on the shores of Kiel Bay, Denmark, the species was presumed extinct. Based on these and a pod that beached itself three months later in November, zoologist Johannes Theodor Reinhardt moved the species in 1862 to the newly erected genus &quot;Pseudorca&quot;, which established it as being neither a porpoise nor a killer whale. The name &quot;false killer whale&quot; comes from the apparent similarity between its skull and that of the killer whale.

The false killer whale is in the family Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins). It is in the subfamily Globicephalinae; its closest living relatives are Risso&#x27;s dolphin, the melon-headed whale (&quot;Peponocephala electra&quot;), the pygmy killer whale (&quot;Feresa attenuata&quot;), pilot whales (&quot;Globicephala&quot; spp.), and possibly snubfin dolphins (&quot;Orcaella&quot; spp.). William Henry Flower suggested in 1884 and later abandoned a distinction between northern and southern false killer whales. Paules Edward Pieris Deraniyagala proposed a subspecies, &quot;P. c. meridionalis&quot;, in 1945, though without enough justification. There are currently no recognized subspecies. Still, individuals in populations around the world can have different skull structure and vary in average length with Japanese false killers found to be 10–20% larger than South African ones. It can hybridize with the bottlenose dolphin (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;) to produce fertile offspring called &quot;wholphins&quot;.

==Description==

The false killer whale is black or dark gray; slightly lighter on the underside. It has a slender body with an elongated, tapered head and 44 teeth. The dorsal fin is sickle-shaped; and flippers are narrow, short, and pointed, with a distinctive bulge on the leading edge of the flipper (the side closest to the head). False killer whales are large marine predators. They are the fourth-largest extant species of oceanic dolphin, exceeded in size only by the orca, and the two species of pilot whales. Females reach a maximum size of in length and in weight, and males long and . Males are about 10–15 % larger than females. Newborns can be long. Body temperature ranges from , increasing during activity. The teeth are conical, and there are 14–21 in the upper jaw and 16–24 in the lower.

A false killer reaches physical maturity at 8 to 14 years; maximum age in captivity is 57 years for males and 62 for females. Sexual maturity happens at 8 to 11 years. In one population, calving was at 7 year intervals; calving can occur year-round, though it usually occurs in late winter. Gestation takes ~15 months; lactation, 9 months to 2 years. The false killer is one of three toothed whales, the other two being the pilot whales, identified as having a sizable lifespan after menopause, which occurs at age 45 to 55.

As a toothed whale, a false killer can echolocate using its melon organ in the forehead to create sound, which it uses to navigate and find prey. The melon is larger in males than in females.

==Behaviour==

The false killer whale has been known to interact non-aggressively with some dolphins: the common bottlenose dolphin, the Pacific white-sided dolphin (&quot;Lagenorhynchus obliquidens&quot;), the rough-toothed dolphin (&quot;Steno bredanensis&quot;), the pilot whales, the melon-headed whale, the pantropical spotted dolphin (&quot;Stenella attenuata&quot;), the pygmy killer whale, and Risso&#x27;s dolphin. They have been shown to engage in depredation at fisheries with killer whales (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;), though their diets differ with the killer whales and false killer whales preferring swordfish (4) and smaller fish respectively.

A false killer may respond to distress calls and protect other species from predators, aid in childbirth by helping to remove the afterbirth, and has been known to interact sexually with bottlenose dolphins (see Wholphin) and pilot whales, including homosexually. It has been known to form mixed-species pods with those dolphins, probably due to shared feeding grounds. In Japan, these only occur in winter, suggesting it is tied to seasonal food shortages.

A pod near Chile had a cruising speed, and false killer whales in captivity were recorded to have a maximum speed of , similar to a bottlenose dolphin. Diving behavior is not well recorded, but one individual near Japan dove for 12 minutes to a depth of . In Japan, one individual had a documented dive of , and one in Hawaii , comparable to pilot whales and other similarly-sized dolphins. Its maximum dive time is likely 18.5 minutes.

The false killer travels in large pods, evidenced by mass strandings; usually 10 to 20 members, though these smaller groups can be part of larger groups; it is highly social and can travel in groups of more than 500 whales. These large groups may break up into smaller family groups of 4 to 6 members while feeding. Members stay with the pod long-term, some recorded as 15 years, and, indicated by mass strandings, share strong bonds with other members. It is thought it has a matrifocal family structure, with mothers heading the pod instead of the father, like in sperm whales and pilot whales. Different populations around the world have different vocalizations, similar to other dolphins. The false killer whale is probably polygynous, with males mating with multiple females.

==Ecology==

The false killer whale is an apex predator, inhabiting tropical and subtropical waters. Generally, the false killer whale targets a wide array of squid and fish of various sizes during daylight hours. They typically target large species of fish, such as mahi-mahi, wahoo and tuna. They are also known to prey on marine mammals, such as some species of dolphins and whales. In captivity, it eats 3.4 to 4.3% of its body weight per day. A video taken in 2016 near Sydney shows a group hunting a juvenile shark. It sometimes discards the tail, gills, and stomach of captured fish, and pod members have been known to share food.

In the Eastern Pacific, the false killer whale has been known to target smaller dolphins during tuna purse-seine fishing operations; there are attacks on sperm whales (&quot;Physeter macrocephalus&quot;), and one instance against a humpback whale (&quot;Megaptera novaeangliae&quot;) calf. Killer whales are known to prey on the false killer, and it also possibly faces a threat from large sharks, though there are no documented instances.

The false killer whale is known to host parasites: trematode &quot;Nasitrema&quot; in the sinuses, nematode &quot;Stenurus&quot; in the sinuses and lungs, an unidentified crassicaudine nematode in the sinuses, stomach nematodes &quot;Anisakis simplex&quot; and &quot;Anisakis typica&quot;, acanthocephalan worm &quot;Bolbosoma capitatum&quot; in the intestines, whale lice &quot;Syncyamus pseudorcae&quot; and &quot;Isocyamus delphinii&quot;, and the whale barnacle &quot;Xenobalanus globicipitis&quot;. Some strandings had whales with large &quot;Bolbosoma&quot; infestations, such as the 1976 and 1986 strandings in Florida.

==Population and distribution==
The false killer whale appears to have a widespread presence in tropical and semitropical oceans. The species has been found in temperate waters, but these occurrences were possibly stray individuals, or associated with warm water events. It generally does not go beyond 50°N or below 50°S. It usually inhabits open ocean and deep-water areas, though it may frequent coastal areas near oceanic islands. Distinct populations inhabit the seas near the Hawaiian Islands and in the eastern North Pacific.

The false killer whale is thought to be common around the world, though no total estimate has been made. The population in the Eastern Pacific is probably in the low tens-of-thousands, and ~16,000 near China and Japan. The population around Hawaii has been declining.

==Human interaction==

The false killer whale is known to be much more adaptable in captivity than other dolphins, being easily trained and highly sociable with other species, and as such it has been kept in several public aquariums around the world, such as in Japan, the United States, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Australia. Individuals were mainly captured off California and Hawaii, and then in Japan and Taiwan after 1980. It has also been successfully bred in captivity. Chester, an orphaned calf that had been stranded near Tofino in 2014 and rescued by Vancouver Aquarium, probably died from a bacterial erysipelas infection in 2017 at the age of approximately three and a half.

The false killer has been known to approach and offer fish it has caught to humans diving or boating. It also takes fish off hooks, which sometimes leads to entanglement or swallowing the hook. Entanglement can cause drowning, loss of circulation to an appendage, or impede the animal&#x27;s ability to hunt, and swallowing the hook can puncture the digestive tract or can become a blockage. In Hawaii, this is likely leading to the decline in local populations, reducing them by 75% from 1989 to 2009. The false killer is more susceptible to organochloride buildup than other dolphins, being higher up on the food chain, and stranded individuals around the world show higher levels than other dolphins. It has been known to ride the wakes of large boats, which could put it at risk of hitting the propeller.

In a few Japanese villages, the false killer is killed in harpooning hunts and drive hunts using sound to herd individuals together and cause a mass stranding or corral them into nets before being killed.A total of 24 false killer whale were hunted in Japan from 2010 to 2023.

==Beachings==

The false killer whale regularly beaches itself, for reasons largely unknown, on coasts around the world, with the largest stranding consisting of 835 individuals on 9 October 1946 at Mar del Plata in Argentina. Unlike other dolphins, but similar to other globicephalines, the false killer usually mass strands in pods, leading to such high mortality rates. These can also occur in temperate waters outside its normal range, such as with the mass strandings in Britain in 1927, 1935, and 1936.
The 30 July 1986 mass stranding of 114 false killers in Flinders Bay, Western Australia was widely watched as volunteers and the newly created Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM) saved 96 whales, and founded an informal network for whale strandings. The 2 June 2005 Geographe Bay stranding of 120 whales in Western Australia, the fourth in the bay, was caused by a storm preventing the animals from seeing the shoreline; this also caused a rescue effort of 1,500 volunteers by CALM.

Since 2005, there have been seven mass strandings of false killer whales in New Zealand involving more than one individual, the largest on 8 April 1943 on the Māhia Peninsula with 300 stranded, and 31 March 1978 in Manukau Harbour with 253 stranded.

Whale strandings are rare in southern Africa, but mass strandings in this area are typically associated with the false killer, with mass strandings averaging at 58 individuals. Hot-spots for mass stranding exist along the coast of the Western Cape in South Africa; the most recent in 30 May 2009 near the village of Kommetjie with 55 individuals.

On 14 January 2017, a pod of ~100 beached themselves in Everglades National Park, Florida, US; the remoteness of the area was detrimental to rescue efforts, causing the deaths of 81 whales. The other two strandings in Florida were in 1986 with three beached whales from a pod of 40 in Cedar Key, and 1980 with 28 stranded in Key West.

==Conservation==
The false killer whale is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS), and the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS). The species is further included in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU).

No accurate global estimates for the false killer whale exist, so the species is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN Redlist. In November 2012, the United States&#x27; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recognized the Hawaiian population of false killers, comprising ~150 whales, as endangered.

<text>The Sunningdale Agreement was an attempt to establish a power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive and a cross-border Council of Ireland. The agreement was signed by the British and Irish government in Sunningdale, Berkshire, on 9 December 1973. Unionist opposition, violence and 
a general strike caused the collapse of the agreement in May 1974.

==Northern Ireland Assembly==

On 20 March 1973, the British government published a white paper which proposed a 78-member Northern Ireland Assembly, to be elected by proportional representation. The British government would retain control over law, order and finance, while a Council of Ireland composed of members of the executive of the Republic of Ireland, Dáil Éireann, the Northern Ireland Executive and the Northern Ireland Assembly would act in a consultative role. The assembly was to replace the suspended Stormont Parliament, but it was hoped that it would not be dominated by the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in the same way, and would thus be acceptable to Nationalists.

The Northern Ireland Assembly Bill resulting from the white paper became law on 3 May 1973, and elections for the new assembly were held on 28 June. The agreement was supported by the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the unionist UUP and the cross-community Alliance Party. The pro-agreement parties won a clear majority of seats (52 to 26), but a substantial minority inside the Ulster Unionist Party opposed the agreement.

==Power-sharing executive==
After the assembly elections, negotiations between the pro-white paper parties on the formation of a &quot;power-sharing executive&quot; began. The main concerns were internment, policing and the question of a Council of Ireland.

On 21 November agreement was reached on a voluntary coalition of pro-agreement parties (unlike the provisions of the Belfast Agreement, which established the d&#x27;Hondt method for the election of ministers, proportionally to the main parties in the assembly). Prominent members of the executive included former Unionist Prime Minister Brian Faulkner as chief executive, SDLP leader Gerry Fitt as deputy chief executive, future Nobel Laureate and SDLP leader John Hume as Minister for Commerce and leader of the Alliance Party Oliver Napier as Legal Minister and head of the Office of Law Reform. Other members of the Executive included Unionist Basil McIvor as Minister for Education, Unionist Herbert Kirk as Minister for Finance, SDLP member Austin Currie as Minister for Housing, Unionist Leslie Morrell as Minister for Agriculture, SDLP member Paddy Devlin as Minister for Health and Social Services, Unionist Roy Bradford as Minister for Environment, and Unionist John Baxter as Minister for information. This new power-sharing executive, made up of the above members, took up office and had its first meeting on 1 January 1974. The UUP was deeply divided: its Standing Committee voted to participate in the executive by a margin of 132 to 105.
&lt;noinclude&gt;

==Council of Ireland==

Provisions for a Council of Ireland existed in the Government of Ireland Act 1920, but these had never been carried out in practice. Unionists resented the idea of any &quot;interference&quot; by what was then Southern Ireland in the territory. In 1973, after agreement had been reached on the formation of an executive, agreement was sought to re-establish a Council of Ireland to stimulate co-operation with the now Republic of Ireland. Talks were held between 6 and 9 December in the Berkshire town of Sunningdale between the British Prime Minister Edward Heath, the Irish Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave and the three pro-agreement parties.

The talks agreed on a two-part Council of Ireland:
* The &quot;Council of Ministers&quot; was to be composed of seven members from the power-sharing executive, and seven members from the Irish Government. It was to have &quot;executive and harmonising functions and a consultative role&quot;.
* The &quot;Consultative Assembly&quot; was to be made up of 30 members from Dáil Éireann and 30 members from the Northern Ireland Assembly. It was to have &quot;advisory and review functions&quot; only.

On 9 December, a communiqué announcing the agreement was issued, which later became known as the &quot;Sunningdale Agreement&quot;.

==Reaction to the agreement==

It was eventually agreed that the executive functions of the Council would be limited to &quot;tourism, conservation, and aspects of animal health&quot;, but this did not reassure the unionists, who saw any influence by the Republic over Northern affairs as a step closer to a united Ireland. They saw their fears confirmed when SDLP councillor Hugh Logue publicly described the Council of Ireland as &quot;the vehicle that would trundle unionists into a united Ireland&quot; in a speech at Trinity College, Dublin.
On 10 December, the day after the agreement was announced, loyalist paramilitaries formed the Ulster Army Council – a coalition of loyalist paramilitary groups, including the Ulster Defence Association and the Ulster Volunteer Force, which would oppose the agreement.

In January 1974, the Ulster Unionist Party narrowly voted against continued participation in the assembly and Faulkner resigned as leader, to be succeeded by the anti-Sunningdale Harry West. The following month a general election took place. The Ulster Unionists formed the United Ulster Unionist Council (UUUC) as a coalition of anti-agreement unionists with the Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party to stand a single anti-Sunningdale candidate in each constituency. The pro-Sunningdale parties, the SDLP, the Alliance, the Northern Ireland Labour Party and the &quot;Pro Assembly Unionists&quot; made up of Faulkner&#x27;s supporters, were disunited and ran candidates against one another. When the results were declared, the UUUC had captured eleven of the twelve constituencies, several of which had been won on split votes. Only West Belfast returned a pro-Sunningdale MP (Gerry Fitt). The UUUC declared that this represented a democratic rejection of the Sunningdale Assembly and Executive, and sought to bring them down by any means possible.

In March 1974, pro-agreement unionists withdrew their support for the agreement, calling for the Republic of Ireland to remove the Articles 2 and 3 of its constitution first (these articles would not be revised until the Good Friday Agreement of 1998).

==Collapse of the agreement==

Following the defeat of a motion condemning power-sharing in the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Ulster Workers&#x27; Council, a loyalist organisation, called a general strike for 15 May. After two weeks of barricades, shortages, rioting and intimidation, Brian Faulkner resigned as chief executive and the Sunningdale Agreement collapsed on 28 May 1974.

The strike succeeded because the British government was reluctant to use force to stop the disruption of essential services, the only significant part of the protest.

The most crippling aspect of the strike was its effect on electricity supply – the Ballylumford power station generated Belfast&#x27;s electricity and that of most of Northern Ireland. The workforce was overwhelmingly Protestant and effective control was firmly in the hands of UWC. John Hume&#x27;s plan to cut the Northern Ireland electricity grid in two and rely on the power generated by Coolkeeragh power station (where many Catholics worked) to keep Derry and environs in business while undermining the unionist strikers in the east was rejected by the British Secretary of State Merlyn Rees.

In later strikes the security forces were prepared to use force immediately, and so intimidatory barricades – essential to the success of the UWC strike – were suppressed from the outset.

==Legacy==

The 1998 Good Friday Agreement (GFA), on which the current system of Northern Irish devolution is based, closely resembles the Sunningdale Agreement. SDLP politician Séamus Mallon, who was part of the negotiations, famously described the agreement as &#x27;Sunningdale for slow learners&#x27;. This assertion has been criticised by political scientists like Richard Wilford and Stefan Wolff. The former stated that &quot;there are... significant differences between them [Sunningdale and Belfast], both in terms of content and the circumstances surrounding their negotiation, implementation, and operation&quot;. Among these differences in circumstance was a belief among republicans at the time of the Sunningdale Agreement that a British withdrawal from Northern Ireland was &quot;inevitable&quot;, which was no longer the case in 1998.

<text>Sunningdale is a village and a civil parish in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead. It takes up the extreme south-east corner of Berkshire, England and is adjoined by green buffers including Sunningdale Golf Club and Wentworth Golf Club. Its northern peripheral estates adjoin Virginia Water Lake.

==Location==
Sunningdale adjoins Surrey, and is east of Sunninghill from which it takes its name. It is south of Virginia Water Lake. It is centred west south-west of Charing Cross, London. The nearest major towns are Bracknell, Camberley, Staines upon Thames and Woking. It is connected to two of these by the A30 old trunk road. Sunningdale railway station is on the Waterloo to Reading line.

==History==
The present-day civil parish of Sunningdale came into existence in 1894 under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1894; the village had previously been part of Old Windsor. It was, until 1995, partly in Berkshire and partly in Surrey. The Surrey area of the village, known as Broomhall, was also split between the boroughs of Surrey Heath and Runnymede. This original arrangement caused problems and was resolved after much consultation locally between the two county councils, three borough councils and four parish councils. As a result, its former Surrey neighbourhoods merged with the rest in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, in the Royal County of Berkshire (which became a non-administrative county in 1995). The area is popular with professional golfers due to its adjoining green buffers including Sunningdale Golf Club and Wentworth Golf Club.

==Mansions==
===Charters===
Charters is a Grade II-listed art deco mansion, built in 1938 for the industrialist Frank Parkinson by the architects Adie, Button and Partners. It was built on the site of an earlier country house built in the late 1860s by William Terrick Hamilton. Parkinson&#x27;s guests included Winston Churchill and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. In 1949, the house was bought by Sir Montague Burton. It later became a corporate headquarters and has since been redeveloped as an apartment complex and spa.

===Coworth House===

Now the Coworth Park Hotel, this is a late 18th-century country house which was the home of Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby, the early 20th-century Secretary of State for War and British Ambassador to France.

===Sunningdale Park===

The Sunningdale Agreement was signed at Sunningdale Park, at the Civil Service Staff College (now the National School of Government) on 9 December 1973, a precursor of the Northern Ireland peace process.

<doc id="420670" wikidata="Q5505978" url="?curid=420670" title="Frontier Conference">
<text>The Frontier Conference is a college athletic conference affiliated with the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). The conference was founded in 1934. Member institutions are located in the U.S. state of Montana, with associate members in the states of Arizona, Idaho, and Oregon.

The Frontier Conference sponsors athletic competition in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, men&#x27;s football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s indoor and outdoor track and field, and women&#x27;s volleyball.

==History==
The Montana Small College Conference (MSCC) was established in 1934 by the five smaller schools (Montana Technological University, the University of Montana Western, Montana State University–Northern, Intermountain Union College and Billings Polytechnic Institute) in the state. The MSCC was renamed as the Montana Collegiate Conference (MCC) in 1936, with the additions of Montana State University Billings and Carroll College joining. The merger of Intermountain Union and Billings Poly to become Rocky Mountain College occurred in 1947. After nearly three decades, the conference reestablished itself under its current moniker in November 1966, containing the same six schools until 1974. The University of Providence (then the College of Great Falls) joined that year, however would only stay for a decade. MSU Billings left for the first incarnation of the Great Northwest Athletic Conference in 1988, leaving the Frontier at five members for another decade. The conference opened up outside of Montana for the first time in 1998, with schools from Idaho (Lewis–Clark State College) and Utah (Westminster College) joining. Great Falls rejoined in 1999. Dickinson State University joined in 2012, only to leave in 2014 to join the North Star Athletic Association (NSAA). Westminster (Utah) left for the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division II ranks and rejoined the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference (RMAC) in 2015. Lewis–Clark State left for the Cascade Collegiate Conference as a full member in 2020.

== Early life ==
Russell was born on March 23, 1976, in Fountain Valley, California, to Stephanie Stephens, a housewife, and David Russell, a Nissan Motors executive. She has an older brother and a younger sister. The family lived in Coppell, Texas; Mesa, Arizona; and Highlands Ranch, Colorado, moving frequently due to her father&#x27;s work.

== Career ==
=== 1990–2002: Early roles and stardom with &quot;Felicity&quot; ===
Russell was a dancer, and her dancing had helped get her a role as a cast member of &quot;The All New Mickey Mouse Club&quot; television show on the Disney Channel. Russell was on the show from 1991 to 1994, encompassing seasons four to six. 

In 1992, she appeared in &quot;Honey, I Blew Up the Kid&quot; and in 1993, had a role on the sitcom &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; as Mr. Feeny&#x27;s niece. She appeared on &quot;Married... with Children&quot; in a 1995 episode (&quot;Radio Free Trumaine&quot;, production 9.24). She subsequently starred in several film and television roles, including the 1996 made-for-television film &quot;The Babysitter&#x27;s Seduction.&quot; That year she also had a role on the short-lived soap opera series &quot;Malibu Shores.&quot;

In 1994, Russell appeared as the &quot;other woman&quot; in Bon Jovi&#x27;s music video &quot;Always&quot;. In 1997, she appeared in two episodes of &quot;Roar&quot;.

From 1998 to 2002, Russell starred as the title character on the successful WB Network series &quot;Felicity&quot;, and in 1999 won a Golden Globe for the role.

During the show&#x27;s run, Russell appeared in the films &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot;, &quot;The Curve&quot; and &quot;Mad About Mambo&quot;, all of which received only limited releases in North America. Her next role was in the film &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; (2002), playing the wife of a United States serviceman during the Vietnam War. The film was released two months before the end of &quot;Felicity&quot;″s run.

=== 2003–2012: Theater and film roles ===
 When &quot;Felicity&quot; ended, Russell moved to New York City and made her off-Broadway stage debut in 2004 in Neil LaBute&#x27;s &quot;Fat Pig&quot;. In 2005, she returned to television and film, beginning with an appearance in the Hallmark Hall of Fame television movie &quot;The Magic of Ordinary Days&quot;, the theatrical film &quot;The Upside of Anger&quot;, and the television miniseries &quot;Into the West&quot;. In 2005, director J. J. Abrams asked Russell to join the cast of &quot;&quot;, and she accepted. She was screen tested for the role of Lois Lane in &quot;Superman Returns&quot; but lost the part to Kate Bosworth.

In mid-2006, Russell was chosen to be a celebrity spokeswoman for CoverGirl cosmetics. In the summer of 2007, Russell appeared in &quot;The Keri Kronicles&quot;, a reality show sitcom sponsored by CoverGirl and airing on MySpace; the show was filmed at Russell&#x27;s home in Manhattan and spotlighted her life. Also in 2007, she played Melody on the NBC show &quot;Scrubs&quot;.

Russell next starred in the film &quot;Waitress&quot;, which marked the fourth time she played a pregnant woman. Her performance was positively received by critics, with Michael Sragow of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; writing that Russell&#x27;s performance had &quot;aesthetic character&quot; and &quot;wields tenderness and fierceness with quiet heat&quot;. In 2007, Russell also completed roles in &quot;Grimm Love&quot; and &quot;The Girl in the Park&quot;.

Russell next appeared in &quot;August Rush&quot;, released in November 2007. Russell later appeared in &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;. In an appearance on &quot;The View&quot; on December 15, 2008, Russell said she got the part because Adam Sandler&#x27;s wife Jackie had seen her in &quot;Waitress&quot; and suggested her for the movie. Russell voiced Wonder Woman in a direct-to-video animated feature released on March 3, 2009.

Russell starred in the Tom Vaughan-helmed &quot;Extraordinary Measures&quot; for CBS Films. The drama, which started filming on April 6, 2009, and was released on January 22, 2010, was the first film to go into production for the new company. Russell played Aileen Crowley, a mother who tries to build a normal home life for her sick children while her husband and an unconventional scientist race against time to find a cure. Russell starred in the Fox series &quot;Running Wilde&quot; from 2010 to 2011.

=== 2013–present: &quot;The Americans&quot; and &quot;The Diplomat&quot; === 

From 2013 to 2018, she starred in the FX drama series &quot;The Americans&quot;, playing Elizabeth Jennings, a deep-undercover Russian KGB spy living as an American in the 1980s Cold War era. She appeared opposite Matthew Rhys, who portrays her character&#x27;s husband and spy partner. Russell and Rhys became partners in real life during this time. The series ended after six seasons. For her performance, she was nominated for three consecutive Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, as well as two Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama. Emily St. James of &quot;Vox&quot; praised her performance describing it as &quot;gorgeously restrained&quot;. 

In 2013, Russell starred in the science-fiction horror film &quot;Dark Skies&quot; and the romantic comedy film &quot;Austenland&quot;. In 2014, she starred in the science fiction action film &quot;Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&quot;, a sequel to 2011&#x27;s &quot;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&quot;. She starred as Serena Knight in the 2016 historical war film &quot;Free State of Jones&quot;. In 2017, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In July 2018, Russell was announced to have joined the cast of the film &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, which was released on December 20, 2019. The film reunited her with J.J. Abrams, with whom she had worked on &quot;Felicity&quot; and &quot;Mission: Impossible III&quot;. 

In March 2019, she starred in the first Broadway revival of Lanford Wilson&#x27;s play &quot;Burn This&quot; at the Hudson Theatre. Frank Rizzo of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote of her performance, &quot;Russell, whose stage credits are slim but who’s proven her chops onscreen in &quot;The Americans&quot;, creates a vivid, if less flashy, performance&quot;, adding, &quot;Still, she’s a force in her own right.&quot;

In 2023, Russell began starring in &quot;The Diplomat&quot;, a political series on Netflix from writer and producer Debora Cahn.

== Personal life ==
In 2006, Russell became engaged to Shane Deary, a Brooklyn-based contractor she met through mutual friends. They married in New York on February 14, 2007. They have two children: a son born in 2007 and a daughter born in 2011. Russell and Deary separated in early 2013 and divorced in mid-2014. Since 2014, she has been in a relationship with Welsh actor Matthew Rhys, her co-star in &quot;The Americans&quot;. They have a son, born in 2016. In interviews conducted in 2021, Russell and Rhys referred to each other as husband and wife.
