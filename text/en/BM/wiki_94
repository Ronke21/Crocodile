<text>The Slovenian Democratic Party (, SDS), formerly the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia (, SDSS), is a conservative parliamentary party; it is also one of the largest parties in Slovenia, with approximately 30,000 reported members in 2013.

It has been described as nationalist and right-wing populist, encompassing both national and social conservatism. Led by former Prime Minister of Slovenia Janez Janša, the SDS is a member of the European People&#x27;s Party, Centrist Democrat International and International Democracy Union.

SDS has its origins in the Slovenian anti-Communist pro-democracy dissident labour union movement of the late 1980s. The Social Democratic Union of Slovenia (later renamed Social Democratic Party and, in 2003, Slovenian Democratic Party) was first headed by trade unionist France Tomšič, then by the prominent Slovenian pro-independence and pro-democracy dissident Jože Pučnik, who resigned in 1993. The party was part of the Democratic Opposition of Slovenia (DEMOS) coalition.

The party&#x27;s early ideological orientation was liberal, social democratic, and civic nationalist, reflecting a broad and somewhat fragmented coalition. In the 1992 parliamentary elections, SDS barely passed the parliamentary threshold, joining a Liberal Democracy of Slovenia-led coalition government. In 1993, Janez Janša, another prominent pro-democracy dissident turned politician, became party leader (a post he has held continuously since); Janša also served as Minister of Defense between 1990 and 1994. In 1994, Janša was ousted from his ministerial post due to his involvement in the Depala Vas affair; SDS consequently left the coalition government. SDS largely remained in opposition for the following 10 years, gaining in popularity and shifting its ideological outlook rightwards in the meanwhile. In 1995, SDS absorbed the conservative National Democratic Party, a former DEMOS coalition partner.

In 2004, SDS placed first in that year&#x27;s parliamentary elections, forming a centre-right governing coalition with Janša as PM. The government oversaw the country&#x27;s entry into the European Union and NATO, and a period of rapid economic growth. The government faced allegations of curtailing media freedom. In the 2008 parliamentary elections, SDS was surpassed by the Social Democrats.

SDS placed second in the 2011 parliamentary elections but managed to secure support for a SDS-led coalition government, forming the second Janša Cabinet. The government took office in the midst of the European debt crisis, instituting widely disliked austerity reforms which helped spark a series of massive anti-government protests. Opposition to the government was further fueled by corruption allegations against Janša, including his alleged involvement in the Patria affair as well as a 2013 KPK report which found that Janša had violated corruption prevention measures. The SDS-led government collapsed in early 2013 after losing support of coalition partners.

At the time of the 2014 parliamentary elections, SDS leader Janša was serving a prison sentence for a bribery conviction (which was later overturned by the supreme court and subsequently expired upon re-trial); SDS placed second. SDS won a plurality of votes in the 2018 election, however, most of the other parliamentary parties made pre-election pledges not to join a coalition government with SDS. After the centre-left coalition collapsed in early 2020, two of the parties that had seen a change of leadership since the election reneged on their pre-election pledge, clearing the path for the third Janša Cabinet. The new SDS-led government took office during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. In recent years, Janša has been described as an illiberal leader.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The Slovenian Democratic Party developed from the merger of two distinct political parties, being the legal successor of both of the Social Democratic Union of Slovenia and the Slovenian Democratic Union, member parties of the Democratic Opposition of Slovenia (DEMOS) which defeated the Communist Party of Slovenia-derived parties in the first democratic Slovenian election in 1990.

The Social Democratic Union of Slovenia had emerged from an independent, anti-Communist trade union movement in the late 1980s. Its first president was the trade union leader France Tomšič, who in December 1987 organized a milestone workers&#x27; strike which lead to the establishment of an independent trade union, Neodvisnost, thus following the example of the Solidarity movement in Poland, and, in 1989, the party (which was the first opposition party in the former communist world). Tomšič was replaced as leader by Jože Pučnik later that year while the SDU was renamed as Social Democratic Party of Slovenia (SDS). Pučnik was a former dissident who had been forced to emigrate to Germany as a political exile in the 1960s.

The Slovenian Democratic Union was founded in January 1989 as opposition to the Communist Party of Slovenia, emphasizing establishment of the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental political freedoms, respect for minority rights, and Euro-Atlantic integration (the European Union and NATO).

In 1991, after a conflict between the leadership and membership of SDU, the Slovenian Democratic Union split into two parties – the social-liberal wing established the Democratic Party (DSS), while the conservative faction founded the National Democratic Party (NDS). Although the Social Democratic Party suffered a clear defeat in the 1992 election, barely entering Parliament, it formed a coalition with the winning Liberal Democracy of Slovenia (LDS) and entered the cabinet of Janez Drnovšek.

Janša became party leader in 1993 after Jože Pučnik resigned due to health issues (Pučnik later became the honorary president of the party, a function he held until his death in January 2003). In 1995, the National Democratic Party joined SDS, which thus became one of the legal successors of the Slovenian Democratic Union.

Janša served as Minister of Defense from 1990 to 1994. Janša has been accused of having abused his position to consolidate political power, engaging in arms trafficking to arm combatants in the Yugoslav Wars in violation of a United Nations arms embargo, and blackmailing prominent individuals, including politicians, businesspeople, journalists, and cultural and literary figures, by threatening to make public information (to which he was privy to in his ministerial role) regarding their previously undisclosed involvement with the former communist secret police.

In 1994, Janez Janša was dismissed by Prime Minister Janez Drnovšek from his role as Defence Minister because of his involvement in the Depala Vas affair (which centered around an incident in which military personnel arrested and mistreated a civilian off-duty undercover police associate that was attempting to obtain classified documents about the Ministry of Defence). SDS subsequently left the Drnovšek government as a result. The dismissal prompted protests by Janša&#x27;s supporters and there were founded fears inside the government that Janša, backed by the nascent military, may refuse to relinquish power. A 2003 Mladina article alleged that Slovenia&#x27;s military&#x27;s special unit (MORiS) was in 1994 performing military exercises intended to prepare the force to carry out a military coup d&#x27;état. The police force was at the same time covertly preparing to secure the state and prevent a military takeover. In a press conference shortly prior to the article&#x27;s publication, Janša pointed to documents detailing these police plans to secure state institutions to argue that a coup was in fact afoot against his Ministry. In a 1999 interview with Delo, Janša commented on the events of 1994, saying: &quot;I held immense power in my hands. [...] And in 1994, when they were deposing me, there was a lot of suggestions that we not accept this removal. I could have done that. But I didn&#x27;t.&quot; In 1995, Janša was charged for alleged illegal arms trafficking, but the case was never brought to trial.

SDS remained in opposition for the next 10 years, except for a brief period in 2000, when it entered a short-lived centre-right government led by Andrej Bajuk, while gaining popularity among – as described by one of its former supporters, Peter Jambrek – &quot;lower, frustrated social strata&quot;.

=== A populist turn ===
After the year 2000, the party applied for membership in the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). The rightward shift culminated in the 2003 name change from Social Democratic Party to Slovenian Democratic party. The party was described as liberal-conservative or conservative-liberal in ideological orientation.

The party&#x27;s radical populism, nationalistic, and xenophobic attacks was also observed by political analysts. Moreover, the local Slovenian Catholic Church supported it more than any other Slovenian political party. Even though not a nominally Christian party, the local church has stood fully and unconditionally behind it.

=== 2004–2008: in power (first Janša Cabinet) ===
On 3 October 2004, SDS won the 2004 parliamentary election with 29.1% of the popular vote and 29 out of 88 seats. SDS then formed a coalition with New Slovenia (NSi), the Slovenian People&#x27;s Party (SLS), and Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia (DeSUS), holding a total of 49 parliamentary seats (out of 90). SDS has been accused of catering to the interests of the Slovenian Roman Catholic Church in exchange for political support.

==== Internal affairs ====
The government introduced measures to supervise, and to curtail the powers of the Slovenian Intelligence and Security Agency. The measures were strongly rebuked by the opposition and segments of the press as an attempt to discredit the secret intelligence service and cast a negative shadow on the policies of previous governments.

==== Freedom of the press ====
The first SDS government was the target of widespread criticism due to allegations of meddling in the independence of the press. The first SDS government has been accused of politicising the independent press by appointing political allies to leadership and journalist positioned in the state Slovenian Press Agency, daily newspaper Delo, regional newspaper Primorske novice, and public media and broadcasting organisation, RTV Slovenia. The government was accused of using state-owned funds and companies with controlling stakes in newspaper companies to purge critical editors and journalists.

State-owned companies also ceased purchasing adverts in the daily newspaper Dnevnik and weekly political magazine Mladina, two publications critical of the administration.

By changing the laws governing the administration of the public broadcaster RTV Slovenia, the government enabled increased political control of the state media organisation&#x27;s editorial board and its board of directors by increasing the number of board members appointed by the government. The law faced a referendum challenge, but was approved by a tight margin as it also promised to lower compulsory contributions for the broadcaster&#x27;s funding.

In a secret 2007 deal with the head of the Laško Brewery that owned the flagship national newspaper Delo as subsidiary, PM Janša secured editorial influence over the newspaper while Laško would be allowed to acquire a stake in a state-owned grocery store corporation. A new, government-friendly editor-in-chief was installed despite overwhelming opposition from the newspaper&#x27;s staff, and nearly a dozen of the newspaper&#x27;s journalists resigned in protest. The remaining journalists found reporting critically on the government increasingly difficult due to pressure from the new leadership. In 2008, after a souring of relations, the head of Laško accused Janša of threatening him with arrest if he refused to sell the Delo newspaper company.

In 2007, over five hundred journalists launched a petition against political pressures on the media. The petition accused premier Janša of limiting press freedom in particular, but was also more broadly aimed against all infringements of press freedom by either government, political actors in general, or media company owners. The International Press Institute voiced support for the petition and called on the government to create an independent body to investigate the claims of media influence. The Association of European Journalists warned in 2007 of Slovene media companies&#x27; boards interfering in journalistic autonomy, reprimanding journalists and fostering other conditions that prevent critical reporting about the government and lead to self-censorship while journalists are also being prevented from covering issues that may go against the interests of the owners. SDS foreign minister Dimitrij Rupel had previously advised media owners to consider thoroughly whether a battle with the government is in their interest.

SDS rejected accusations of impropriety, claiming the media was in fact controlled by leftist opposition groups.

==== Economy and finance ====
The first Cabinet of Janez Janša oversaw a period of rapid economic growth. GDP grew by nearly 5% between 2004 and 2006, reaching nearly 7% growth in 2007, making Slovenia the fastest-growing eurozone member for that year. The economic boom, however, was highly dependent on private debt, particularly corporate debt. Additionally, the Janša government failed to implement meaningful structural reforms or accumulate budget surpluses during the period of sustained growth, instead opting for pork barrel politics, reducing tax burdens while engaging in economic populist overspending, making the country particularly susceptible to the coming economic crisis.

Andrej Bajuk, Minister of Finance in Janša&#x27;s first cabinet, listed the passage of comprehensive tax reform (which included the lowering of corporate taxes and taxes on juridical persons, a reduction of the tax burden on individual incomes, the flattening of income tax margin progression, an increase in tax deductions, and a simplification of the tax code), overseeing the implementation of the Euro and the privatisation of state-owned NKBM bank, and reducing public expenditure as the greatest accomplishments of the ministry during his term (2004–2008).

According to Janša, the most prominent economic challenge confronted by his government was a bout of inflation (which occurred during the 2007-08 period and was steepest for foodstuff prices). At the close of 2007, the inflation rate in Slovenia was the highest of any Eurozone member. Janša, Finance Minister Bajuk and other government officials pointed to high oil prices and a non-competitive internal food market as the main underlying causes for the inflation. Janša faced criticism for his statement regarding the issue made during a gathering of regional politicians and businessmen; Janša dismissed concerns regarding rising food prices, saying that &quot;as long as there are loaves of bread in every city dumpster the situation isn&#x27;t alarming&quot;. Economic Development Minister Andrej Vizjak similarly addressed cost of living concerns by saying that citizens &quot;should not be loath to occasionally eat yesterday&#x27;s bread&quot;, going on to say that the food price increases are an opportunity to address the overindulgence of Slovenian consumers.

=== 2008–2011: in opposition ===
In the 2008 parliamentary election (held on 21 September 2008) narrowly lost against the Social Democrats, until then the main opposition party. It also lost one seat in Slovenian Parliament, falling to 28.

With the election of the Social Democrat leader Borut Pahor as Prime Minister of Slovenia, the Slovenian Democratic Party officially declared it would stay in opposition and form a shadow cabinet. The shadow government was formed in late December 2008, and it includes several independent members as well as members from other conservative parties.

In the 2009 European election, the SDS was the most popular party in Slovenia with 26.9% of votes, more than eight points ahead of the second-most popular party, the ruling Social Democrats.

In 2009, the MP Franc Pukšič left the Slovenian Democratic Party and joined the Slovenian People&#x27;s Party; the SDS parliamentary group was thus reduced from 28 to 27 MPs.

=== 2012–2013: a year in power (second Janša Cabinet) ===
In the 2011 snap parliamentary election (held on 4 December after the centre-left governing coalition collapsed due to internal conflict and inefficacy in passing meaningful economic reforms), SDS won 26.19% of the vote, gaining 26 seats in the National Assembly, thus making SDS the second-largest parliamentary party after the newly formed centre-left party, Positive Slovenia (PS) (headed by Ljubljana mayor Zoran Janković), which won 28 MPs (28.5% of the total). However, SDS succeeded in forming a ruling four-party coalition government (which included the Civic List, New Slovenia, Slovenian People&#x27;s Party, and Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia) (holding a combined total of 50 out of 90 parliamentary seats) some two months after the election after PS failed to form a coalition with a parliamentary majority. The coalition took power amid an alarming economic downturn (European debt crisis). The country&#x27;s economic woes were further exacerbated by credit agencies&#x27; lowering of Slovenia&#x27;s credit rating amid the political tumult.

The coalition, headed by SDS, undertook drastic economic and financial reforms in an attempt to halt the economic downturn. Finance Minister Janez Šuštaršič pledged to speed up privatisation of state enterprises, cut public spending, and reduce budget shortfalls. Janša additionally pledged to cut taxes, remove regulations, lower the deficit, and raise the retirement age. The coalition passed laws transferring all state-owned enterprises into a single state holding company to accelerate privatisation efforts, and created a bad bank that would take on non-performing loans from the bad debt-ridden state-owned banks. It intended to cut profit and income taxes to boost the economy, and enact constitutional changes demanding balance budgets. It also passed sweeping and highly contentious austerity measures (the Law of Public Finance Balance (Slovene: &quot;Zakon o uravnovešenju javnih financ&quot; (&quot;ZUJF&quot;))), and reportedly planned further cuts to state spending. The &quot;ZUJF&quot; fiscal consolidation law included provisions lowering pensions (widely opposed by the public), cutting wages for public sector employees, reducing education funding, social transfers and benefits. The draft of the law sparked a public sector general strike, and the law faced the possibility of a referendum.

The SDS-led government proved impotent in stemming the economic troubles facing the nation. Despite the momentous reforms efforts, the economic troubles intensified, resulting in increasing levels of unemployment, plunging living standards, a fall in domestic spending, and large budget deficits. The fall in domestic demand, coupled with falling exports, resulted in a double dip recession. A 2016 article alleges that the sharp downturn in Slovenian economic outlook was a result of Janša&#x27;s overdramatic public statements regarding the economic fitness of the nation. Janša reportedly made such ominous claims for political purposes as means of solidifying political power and as a negotiating strategy to strengthen his hand during negotiations with public sector unions. The PM&#x27;s eerie pronouncements were taken at face value by foreign observers, however, creating a self-fulfilling feedback loop where gloomy statements made by top Slovene officials created more panic and dismay in the foreign press and various organisations, and vice versa, resulting in falling credit ratings and asset prices, and excessive capital injections/bailouts with funds borrowed at excessively high interest rates.

In late 2012, protests began to take place in Slovenia&#x27;s second largest city, Maribor, against its mayor and SDS ally, Franc Kangler, who was being investigated due to allegations of corruption. The protests soon picked up momentum and spread across the country, becoming the largest in the independent republic&#x27;s history. Protestors&#x27; main grievances were the harsh austerity measures imposed by the ruling government, looming sale-offs of state enterprises, and allegations of widespread corruption among the ruling elite. The protests also saw the worst violence in the nation&#x27;s history as an independent state, with small groups of young, violent extremists - likely members of far-right and hooligan groups - clashing with police. In early 2013, the instability and public resentment was compounded after the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption revealed both PM Janez Janša and the leader of the largest opposition party (PS), Zoran Janković, violated anti-corruption laws by failing to report or account for assets in their possession and received income/payments. Janša also faced graft charges even before ascending to the premiership in 2012. He was one of the defendants being tried for corruption as result of a 2006 bribery scandal involving charges of accepting kickbacks to fund his party&#x27;s electoral campaign. Media reports alleging Slovenian Intelligence and Security Agency was &quot;infiltrated&quot; by members of SDS also surfaced. Amid mounting pressure from continuing anti-government protests, a strike of public sector workers, and the lowest public opinion ratings of any government in the nation&#x27;s history, coalition partners began to depart from the coalition. The government finally collapsed after a vote of no confidence, and a PS consensus candidate, Alenka Bratušek, was appointed as PM (despite some protests that continued to demand a snap election).

=== 2013–2020: return to opposition ===
On 20 March 2013, the second Janša cabinet was replaced by the cabinet of Alenka Bratušek, a four-party centre-left coalition led by the new leader of Positive Slovenia, Alenka Bratušek.

In June 2013, Janša was convicted in the Patria case, but appealed the verdict. In April 2014, the Higher Court upheld the two-year jail sentence passed on Janez Janša as result of the bribery conviction. In June of that year, Janša began serving out his sentence, 26 years after his imprisonment for leaking military secrets as a whistle-blower (his imprisonment, trial, and public reaction were a milestone in the Slovenian path to independence). Despite his imprisonment, Janša stood as candidate for MP.

In the May 2014 European Parliament election, SDS came in first place nationally, garnering 24.78% of the vote, and winning three MEP seats (out of eight allocated for Slovenia).

The party received 20.69% of the vote in the snap Slovenian parliamentary election held on 13 July 2014, and won 21 seats in parliament. The party remained in opposition, this time to the cabinet of Miro Cerar. Janez Janša was reelected as MP despite being imprisoned. The Constitutional Court decided not to deprive Janša of his MP mandate, and Janša was allowed leave while carrying out his political functions. The Constitutional Court suspended Janša&#x27;s jail sentence in December, pending the ruling regarding his appeal of the Patria verdict. The Constitutional Court decided to annul the Higher Court&#x27;s decision in April 2015, returning it to the lower courts for retrial. In September of the same year, the statute of limitations of the Patria case expired.

SDS representatives expressed the belief that the trial was politically motivated and that the imprisonment of the party frontman unfairly hindered their election efforts, declaring the elections illegitimate and &quot;stolen&quot;, and demanded fresh elections. In 2018, SDS sued the state for alleged financial damages the party incurred due to the alleged election &quot;theft&quot;, and lost the case.

With a campaign largely based on anti-immigration populist rhetoric, SDS topped public opinion polls heading into the 2018 parliamentary election. The incendiary electoral campaign sparked a rally under the title &quot;Without Fear — Against the Politics of Hatred&quot;, with some 2,000-3,000 heart-shaped balloon-carrying marchers in attendance.

During the 2018 electoral campaign, SDS also begun to send postable questionnaires (&quot;voter consults&quot;) to Slovene households. The questionnaires contained loaded questions and proposals (e.g. &quot;... Do you support SDS&#x27;s proposal that the healthcare system be set in order?&quot;). The effort was apparently part of the party&#x27;s electoral campaign, and likely fashioned on Hungarian &quot;national consultations&quot;, which the country&#x27;s ruling party has practiced for years.

SDS once again emerged as winner in the 3 June 2018 parliamentary election, garnering 24.92% of the vote and winning 25 MP seats. However, the party was unlikely to be able to shore up needed support for a governing coalition, as most parliamentary parties (List of Marjan Šarec, Social Democrats, Modern Centre Party, The Left, Party of Alenka Bratušek, and Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia) had declared that they would not participate in a coalition with SDS. Some two weeks after the 2018 election, Janša again met with Hungarian PM Orbán during a private visit in Budapest. Janša and Orbán also held a conference call with US president Donald Trump during the meeting. Janša stated he would be willing to relinquish his post as PM designate to some other SDS MP such a move would ease tensions and enable SDS to form a coalition government. Despite the concession, the PM post was eventually occupied by the leader of the second largest parliamentary party, Marjan Šarec, who succeeded in forming a centre-left minority government (without the participation of SDS).

After the 2018 parliamentary election, SDS failed to regain its traditionally strong showing of support in opinion polls which had been typical for the party while in opposition. Speaking to the media regarding the faltering performance, SDS officials blamed the government&#x27;s alleged populist economic policies and a disproportionately hostile news media, while independent political analysts pointed to the big tent populist appeal of the ruling LMŠ party and its leader that attracted some traditionally conservative voters, and the momentous changes in the political environment and nature of SDS since 2011-2012.

=== 2020–2022: third Janša Cabinet ===

In early 2020, the resignation of the finance minister due to intra-government disagreements regarding the crafting of a health insurance reform bill precipitated the resignation of PM Šarec, who called for an early election. SDS was however able to secure support for the formation of a new SDS-led government by forming a coalition with New Slovenia, Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia (DeSUS), and Modern Centre Party (SMC). While all three parties had expressed clear opposition to a formation of a Janša-led government in the past, all had since experienced changes of leadership that was more amenable to such an arrangement. The news that SMC would be entering into a coalition with Janša resulted in the departure of the party&#x27;s founder and first head, Miro Cerar, after whom the party was initially named (&quot;Miro Cerar Party&quot;).

Janša was confirmed as PM on 13 March 2020. The coalition agreement signed between the 4 parties stipulated, among other things: the re-introduction of the draft and 6 months of mandatory military service, utilisation of private healthcare providers to reduce waiting times, an increase in public and private healthcare funds, promote apprenticeships in vocational school, a commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050, decentralisation, decreasing public spending, an increase in funds for municipalities, tax reductions for performance pay, an increase in pensions, and an introduction of a universal child benefit instead of an income-based one.

=== 2022–present: return to opposition again ===

In April 2022, liberal opposition, The Freedom Movement, won the parliamentary election. The Freedom Movement won 34.5% of the vote, compared with 23.6% for Slovenian Democratic Party. On 25 May 2022, Slovenia&#x27;s parliament voted to appoint the leader of Freedom Movement, Robert Golob, as the new Prime Minister of Slovenia to succeed Janez Janša.

Following the 2024 European Parliament elections, Janša opposed the European People&#x27;s Party maintaining its coalition with left-leaning parliamentary groups, and expressed openness to leaving the EPP. There was speculation that the SDS would join the right-wing Patriots for Europe group, though this ultimately did not happen.

== Ideology and policies ==
Originally a centre-left to centre-right political party, SDS gradually drifted rightward, eventually becoming a right-wing party.

Janša has been described as an illiberal leader. Commenting on the question of illiberal democracies like those in Hungary and Poland, Janša stated: &quot;For me, all of these mainstream political orientations are equal, and equally legitimate. [...] I cannot agree to the division between liberal and illiberal democracy. Democracy is democracy [...] If I fight for the affection of my voters, in a free world, everyone is equal.&quot;

Deutsche Welle has described supporters of the party as &quot;disagree[ing] with the majority of the population on more or less everything, starting with the history of World War II, where they cherish the memory of the German-allied wartime military guard.&quot;

=== Populism ===
During the European migrant crisis, SDS sharply intensified its nationalist populist rhetoric. The party came out in opposition of migrant quotas and advocated diverting financial resources from non-governmental organisations to security spending. Janša also lambasted the &quot;degenerate left&quot;. The party&#x27;s heated rhetoric and allegations of corrupt practices have led &quot;to concerns among international observers about the direction of Slovenia, which is generally regarded as a regional success story&quot; as SDS topped opinion polls heading into the 2018 parliamentary election.

The party has co-opted former US President Donald Trump&#x27;s populist rhetoric, with Janša and the party echoing Trump&#x27;s catchphrases &quot;drain the swamp&quot;, &quot;deep state&quot;, and &quot;fake news&quot;. The party has also proposed requiring that for each new regulation, two existing regulations must be repealed, a proposal notably advocated for and enacted by Trump. Janša has also used the phrase &quot;Slovenia first&quot; on multiple occasions. Janša&#x27;s rhetoric has been described as &quot;Trumpian&quot;.

The party periodically sends questionnaire mailers to Slovene households. The so-called &quot;Consultations with Voters&quot; ask recipients to fill out answers to highly suggestive questions and enter their personal information to be eligible to receive various prizes.

=== Domestic policy ===
==== Economic policy ====
SDS has been described as broadly pro-market, and its economic policies have been characterised as neoliberal. SDS advocates for lower taxes and speeding up privatisation efforts.

==== Social policy ====
SDS introduced legislation allowing for same-sex civil unions while in government, but has opposed recognition of same-sex marriages. PM Janša was one of the few EU leaders to explicitly back the Hungarian government&#x27;s right to prohibit the portrayal of LGBT persons and topics in mass media which could be seen by children.

==== Education policy ====
SDS advocates the introduction of educational programs that would introduce &quot;patriotic education from kindergarten through high school&quot;. The party holds that all expenses of compulsory curricular programs in private schools should be borne by the state.

==== National security ====
Janša has expressed strong support for the re-instatement of mandatory military service for males with service lasting at least 6 months (with an option of 12 months of civil service for conscientious objectors).

In early 2016, SDS proposed the establishment of a national guard composed of some 25,000 &quot;patriotic&quot; volunteers. The guard would replace all current reserve formations of the Slovene armed forces, would be under direct command of the general staff, and would be mobilised during natural disasters or during &quot;altered national security states&quot; (like the European refugee crisis, which was ongoing at the time). Both sexes could enlist. MP Žan Mahnič stated the establishment of the formation was a priority of the party&#x27;s electoral platform. The proposal was prompted by worsening global national security prospects, in part due to the &quot;migrant crisis&quot;, an SDS representative claimed. Government representatives argued that such a formation is unnecessary as the current reserve formations are sufficient.

==== Judiciary and law enforcement ====
SDS advocates for trials to be open to the public (except in special circumstances).

==== Environment and climate change ====
During the first SDS government, PM Janša presented climate change as the major political and societal challenge of the era. In 2007, Janša stated that &quot;climate change is not only a problem for the government and economy; it is a challenge for the wider society and every individual&quot; during an international conference on the matter, stressing the dangers and opportunities associated with the issue. He called on the EU to lead the efforts to combat climate change. In 2008, Janša described an EU legislative package on energy and climate change as &quot;one of the most important ... of the beginning of the 21st century&quot;, and as one of the priorities of Slovenia during its EU Council Presidency. In 2008, SDS MEP Romana Jordan Cizelj stated that &quot;counteracting climate change is not an individual choice, but a global challenge requiring the effort of the society as a whole. [...] The data reveal changes in ecosystems due to antropogenic emissions and possible trends in the future. [...] It is still possible to act. But we must act decisively, swiftly, and in unison. First in coordination within the EU, and then in the global sense.&quot;

By 2018, the party seemed to have reversed its position on the issue, with MP Branko Grims prominently making multiple public statements, including in media statements and parliamentary discussions, that outright denied the existence of anthropogenic climate change. Grims has said that &quot;the talk about the warming of the Earth is a big lie&quot;, that the Earth is in fact cooling, that climate change is being used as an excuse for allowing mass migrations and the expropriation of taxpayer funds (that are then embezzled by academics, the &quot;eco-industry&quot; and leftist lobbies), and that the political left is using the issue to exploit the youth. Grims has appealed to his background as a geologist to present himself as authoritative on the issue. Grims also controversially claimed that the black panther, which is ostensibly represented in the Carantanian panther sigil that has been adopted as the alternate Slovenian national symbol by some modern-era conservative political groups, was native to the Slovene region but became extinct due to global cooling during the Carantanian era (the claim was dismissed by experts who said the black panther had not been endemic to the region since at least the last ice age). In November 2019, Janša, discussing climate change, stated: &quot;Times are different now, generations are growing up with an awareness that the environment is a value. Of course, some on the left scene, pervaded by cultural Marxism, have swiftly added catastrophic proclamations which are supposed to be caused by climate change. It is being preached how climate change is exclusively man-made, which is entirely unproven. Climate change has been occurring throughout the history of this planet and will continue to. To what extent we are influencing this is a big question. It is a fact that we are. It is a fact that environmental pollution of course in part affects the climate. But I think that it affects it much less than changes on the Sun, or, that is, things which humans cannot influence. This must be understood and it should not be made into ideology and the fame of new Molochs such as Greta.&quot;

==== Other policies ====
SDS has long advocated for a change in the Slovene parliamentary electoral system, namely the shift from the current proportional electoral system to two-round plurality voting. SDS argues this would result in more stable and effective governments.

SDS supports citizens&#x27; &quot;legal right to bear arms&quot;, and has come out in opposition to further restrictions. It strongly opposed new EU regulation of firearms which the European Commission moved to pass after the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks. SDS has backed legislation to loosen controls on civilian possession of firearms, firearm accessories, and other weapons. In 2023, Janša called on citizens to legally arm themselves in order to &quot;protect their family and their country&quot; from immigrants, saying that the current government was incapable of protecting the country and its citizens.

SDS supports legalising the medicinal use of cannabis, but opposes legalisation of its recreational use.

SDS opposes the legalisation of assisted dying.

SDS argues the current text to the Slovene national anthem—the 7th stanza of France Prešeren&#x27;s A Toast (&quot;Blessed be all nations/Which yearn to see the light of day/When where&#x27;er the Sun doth wander/The lands&#x27; strife shall be cast away/And when free every kinsman will be/Not fiends, only neighbours in foreigners we&#x27;ll see!&quot;)—is &quot;too internationalistic, and insufficiently patriotic&quot;, and advocates other stanzas from Prešeren&#x27;s poem be added as text to the official anthem.

The party advocates a ban on &quot;all public expression of ideas through the use of totalitarian symbols&quot; and &quot;all public displays of affection for totalitarian regimes&quot;. The party has denied accusations that it is merely attempting to outlaw the red star, which was the symbol of the Slovene Partisans during WWII, and is still often used in the Slovenian public sphere, including as a symbol/logo of a parliamentary political party. The proposed law would not, on the other hand, ban wearing Nazi uniforms in public or displaying symbols associated with the Nazi-aligned anti-Partisan Slovene Home Guard.

=== Foreign policy ===
The party is pro-European, but staunchly anti-immigration and strongly opposed to EU asylum quotas. The party is committed to Slovenia&#x27;s continuing membership in NATO.

Following the US targeted killing of Iranian gen. Qasem Soleimani, the party released a statement declaring that &quot;SDS supports the strong US response to the provocations of the Ayatollah extremist regime ... .&quot;

Janša has expressed steadfast support for Israel and former Israeli PM Netanyahu and his government. During the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, the SDS-led Slovenian government flew an Israeli flag on the ediface of the building housing the Slovene government as a show of support and solidarity with Israel. PM Janša has described criticism of Israel&#x27;s policies towards Palestinians as tantamount to antisemitism.

After taking over the European Council presidency in 2021, the third Janša government chose confronting violent left-wing extremism and anarchism at the EU level as one of its proposed policy priorities.

Janša and SDS support Ukraine in the context of the Russo-Ukrainian War and advocate a hardline stance against Russia. In 2014, the party put out a statement endorsing the Euromaidan protests and the efforts of fellow EPP affiliates therein, condemning human rights abuses by the then-incumbent Ukrainian government of Viktor Yanukovych. In 2015, SDS accused Miro Cerar&#x27;s then-incumbent Slovenian government of Russophilia and drifting away from Europe, citing a visit to Slovenia by then-Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev. Following the full-scale 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Janša was among the first foreign leaders to visit Ukraine on 15 March 2022 alongside the Polish and Czech prime ministers at the time, respectively Mateusz Morawiecki and Petr Fiala. The visit was aimed at supporting Ukraine&#x27;s independence.

=== Post-communist cabal conspiracy ===
The central tenet of the party&#x27;s view regarding the country&#x27;s political situation is that a clique composed mostly of former Communist Party officials and associates has retained significant control over the economic, financial, political, social, judicial, and journalistic aspects of Slovenian public life. SDS has accused the post-communist underground of undermining SDS-led governments and lamented that &quot;Slovenia is the only former communist country that has not implemented the lustration.&quot; In 2021, PM Janša addressed an official missive to the European Commission, calling on the European Union to launch an official inquiry into the &quot;problem ... [of] Slovenia&#x27;s communist legacy&quot; that is ostensibly endangering &quot;the state of democracy in Slovenia&quot;, and to aid the Slovenian government in remedying the situation. SDS&#x27;s emphasis on the role of former Yugoslav communist party affiliates in Slovene political and public life has been criticised as hypocritical since many SDS politicians were also active within the former Yugoslav communist regime.

In a 2021 draft party resolution, SDS warned that the country&#x27;s democratic order is under threat from leftist extremist forces at home and abroad, claiming that the country may be on the verge of a coup, civil war, and an establishment of a totalitarian government. The document claims that the goal of the entrenched elites has progressed beyond attempting to eliminate Janša and SDS, to attempting to institute a new communist order in the country. The document also calls for the banning of the allegedly unconstitutional party The Left (citing a fake &quot;secret manifesto&quot; of the party), and concludes by affirming the party&#x27;s commitment to prevent, by any means necessary, &quot;the establishment of an eco-socialist system ... totalitarian system&quot;. Shortly after releasing the party document, SDS requested a parliamentary session to be held to discuss the ostensible unconstitutional conduct of The Left party and pass a resolution calling on &quot;all state organs to intensify their monitoring, investigations, and prevention of attempts to overthrow parliamentary democracy and other constitutional foundations&quot; due to The Left party&#x27;s policies, and inviting the ministers of interior and defense as well as the chief of national intelligence to participate in the session. The speaker of parliament refused to hold the session after ascertaining that the issue was under the purview of the judicial branch. After the 3rd Janša government was defeated in the 2022 Slovenian parliamentary elections, Janša repeatedly accused the succeeding Golob government of leading the country into civil war. In a lengthy 2023 essay, Janša warned of impending deadly violence from leftist government supporters and warned that his side will respond to any killing of one of theirs with retaliatory mass killings: &quot;[they are] once again reviving the ominous spirit of CIVIL WAR [...] Those who threaten DEATH today, who applaud such threats or encourage them by implementing the government measures listed above, are mostly publicly known. The digital world holds all these records. So, beware. [...] A revolt will break out, and there is no tax haven that is far away enough where those responsible can hide from the hand of justice. [...] realise that the lady with the scythe is swinging from both sides. [...] people of a particular calibre only understood this language. So, we have used it, and we believe that they have understood it. But we no longer believe that they will listen to what we have to say. They have taken things too far.&quot;

SDS members and affiliates frequently employ particular phrases and concepts to represent their world-view, most notably:
* &quot;Udbomafia&quot; (from UDBA, the Yugoslav secret police service) – a portmanteau neologism coined in the early 1990s to refer to an alleged cabal of former Slovenian Communist Party members and officials, and UDBA informants and collaborators that supposedly still hold the reins of economic and political power. The phrase is often used by SDS and affiliated publications.
* &quot;Uncles from behind the scenes&quot; (or &quot;godfathers in the background,&quot; an idiom for éminence grise) – alleged sponsors and influencers of prominent Slovene politicians who are said to merely act as fronts for the vested political and economic interests of the &quot;uncles&quot;. Former PMs Miro Cerar, and Alenka Bratušek, PS head Zoran Janković, and anti-establishment newcomer Marjan Šarec are some of the politicians accused of having &quot;uncles from behind the scenes&quot;. The phrase was also occasionally used by former PM and President Borut Pahor, on one occasion accusing the &quot;uncles&quot; of attempting to topple his premiership. Milan Kučan, who is most often accused of being the foremost &quot;uncle from behind the scenes&quot;, demanded Pahor clarify his insinuation. Pahor also accused his main 2017 presidential election challenger, Marjan Šarec, of being well looked after by the &quot;uncles&quot;. Šarec likewise demanded Pahor clarify his statements, but also did not receive an answer.
* Milan Kučan – the former two-time President of Slovenia and last leader of the League of Communists of Slovenia is frequently accused by SDS of exerting supreme covert influence over the Slovenian political sphere. In 2013, SDS alleged that Kučan was acting from behind the scenes to topple the SDS-led government; the allegation was made in a formal letter that the party addressed to multiple foreign institutions. Politicians allegedly under Kučan&#x27;s influence include former New Slovenia leader Ljudmila Novak and 2018 newcomer Marjan Šarec, former PM Alenka Bratušek and Ljubljana mayor and PS leader Zoran Janković, among others. Janša was fined €12,000 after labelling two female RTV Slovenia journalists as &quot;cheap, used-up prostitutes&quot; of &quot;#pimpMilan [Kučan]&quot; in a tweet, later also receiving a 3-month suspended jail sentence for the offense. During an event marking the handover of the rotating European Council leadership to PM Janša, Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen both opened and closed her speech by quoting Kučan in what was seen as a subtle jibe at Janša&#x27;s political camp.
* Forum 21 – a Slovenian liberal think tank established by Milan Kučan and attended by prominent members of the Slovenian political and economic elite to discuss relevant problems facing the nation. SDS has accused the think tank of undue influence in appointment and policy decisions of liberal governments.
* Murgle – the upscale Murgle residential district known for its one-story houses is home to many prominent Slovenian political and economic figures, including former liberal presidents Milan Kučan (often the main target of allusions to &quot;Murgle&quot;) and Janez Drnovšek (deceased), former PM Miro Cerar, and Liberation Front partisan and last president of the SR Slovenia, Janez Stanovnik, among others. &quot;Murgle&quot; is thus another reference to the alleged behind-the-scenes influence exerted by the country&#x27;s ostensibly retired leftist elites. Upon being sentenced to a two-year prison sentence in the Patria corruption case, Janez Janša stated that the verdict was &quot;written in advance in Murgle and by known authors&quot;. SDS later labelled the 2014 parliamentary election as illegitimate due to the conviction and resulting concurring prison term of Janša. Janša also blamed &quot;Murgle&quot; after prosecutors filed a motion to confiscate Janša&#x27;s illegally obtained holdings. As part of its 2018 electoral campaign, SDS released an ad where a couple orders pizza delivery from SDS and &quot;Pizza Murgle&quot;. The Murgle box is revealed to only contain half a pizza. SDS-affiliated Nova24TV news portal also promoted videos entitled &quot;Murgle Puppet Theatre&quot;, which satirically portrayed a closed-door meeting presided over by Milan Kučan discussing political strategy with recently resigned PM Miro Cerar (leader of ruling Modern Centre Party), Agriculture Minister Dejan Židan (leader of the Social Democrats), Foreign Minister Karl Erjavec (leader of DeSUS), and Marjan Šarec (leader of the List of Marjan Šarec).
*First-class and second-class citizens – the Slovenian society is ostensibly divided between the first-class entrenched leftist elites seeking to perpetuate their socioeconomic privileges and stranglehold over the country, and the downtrodden masses of second-class citizens that SDS advocates for. In 2019, Janša published a book of essays entitled &quot;First-Class Citizens: A System for the False Elite&quot;. The SDS-affiliated TV channel Nova24TV has aired a program named &quot;Second-Class Citizens&quot;.

== Organization ==
=== Leadership ===
The Social Democratic Party and Slovenian Democratic Party had the following presidents. 
* France Tomšič, 1989.
* Jože Pučnik, 1989–1993.
* Janez Janša, 1993–current.

=== Membership ===
As of 2013, SDS membership numbered some 30,000 strong, more than any other political party in Slovenia. Slovenian Democratic Youth (, SDM) is the independent and autonomous youth wing of the party.

=== Supporters and affiliates ===
SDS has seen some support from the Slovene Catholic Church. The party enjoys strong support in some Slovene conservative and classical liberal intellectual circles. Public figures who have publicly voiced support for SDS or affiliated themselves with the party include economist Ljubo Sirc (joined the party in 2010), philosopher Ivan Urbančič, historians Vasko Simoniti and Alenka Puhar, writer and essayist Drago Jančar, theologian and philosopher Janez Juhant, and poet Tone Kuntner. Public supporters of the party also include sportsmen Miran Pavlin, and Katja Koren, pop singer Marta Zore, designer and cartoonist Miki Muster, and actor Roman Končar.

In 2008, SDS was found to have falsely attributed &quot;supporter status&quot; to many prominent Slovenes on its webpage. The party sent a request to comment on the ruling government for its party newspaper to numerous notable public figures. Though they were never asked whether they support the party or informed they will be listed as supporters, SDS nevertheless listed them as such.

==== Former supporters and affiliates ====
Many prominent members have abandoned SDS due to the radicalisation of the party&#x27;s ideology and disagreements over leadership style. Some also established new political parties. Most former members politically transitioned towards the centre, with a minority outflanking SDS on the far right. Former public supporters include: sportsman Miran Pavlin.

Former supporters or affiliated individuals that have since come out as critics of the party include: one of the fathers of the current Slovenian Constitution Peter Jambrek, the former chairman of Rally for the Republic and Civic List party leader Gregor Virant, and liberal economist Jože P. Damijan, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Dimitrij Rupel, former Minister of Internal Affairs Dragutin Mate, and Minister of Education Žiga Turk, former MEP Romana Jordan Cizelj, former SDS MPs Andrej Čuš, and Ivo Hvalica, and &quot;mother of the party&quot; Vera Ban. Miha Brejc became &quot;persona non grata&quot; after his son-in-law Gregor Virant distanced himself from Janša and established the Civic List.

=== Affiliated organisations ===
The party is affiliated with the Jože Pučnik Institute, the major liberal-conservative think tank in Slovenia. It is also closely affiliated with the civic platform Rally for the Republic ().

Committee 2014 (Slovene: &quot;Odbor 2014&quot;) is a civic organisation that was established to protest and demand the overturn of the corruption convictions in the Patria case, the freeing of SDS leader Janez Janša from prison (sentence resulting from the conviction), and the &quot;actual implementation of the rule of law, human rights, basic freedoms, and establishment of a democratic society&quot;. Committee 2014 held regular protests in front of the Higher Court building in Ljubljana.

The Alliance for the Values of Slovene Independence (Slovene: &quot;Združenje za vrednote Slovenske osamosvojitve&quot;, VSO) is a patriotic veteran non-governmental organisation intended to commemorate the values of the Slovenian independence movement. VSO leadership consists of prominent SDS members and associates. The organisation holds public speaking events, commemorations, and is engaged in other activities as well.

==== Affiliated publications ====
SDS is also affiliated with several current and past publications, including its de facto party publication, Demokracija, and tabloid Škandal24 (both owned by &quot;Nova Obzorja&quot; (English: &quot;New Horizons&quot;) publishing company, which is in turn jointly owned by SDS and a Hungarian publishing company with close ties to Hungary&#x27;s ruling party, Fidesz). The publishing company has profited from providing literature to, and advising the SDS parliamentary group/SDS MPs (activities for which parliamentary groups receive state funds), and has also benefited financially from doing business with government agencies, which were particularly bountiful while SDS was in government. Nova24TV, a media conglomerate consisting of a television channel and online news portal, was established by SDS MPs and members, and party sympathisers, and later also received financial injections from Hungarian Fidesz-affiliated companies. Additionally, the SDS-friendly political web portal Politikis is also owned and managed by a close SDS associate. Slovenski tednik and Ekspres, free newspapers distributed in the run-up to the 2008 parliamentary election, were also later found to have been directly linked to SDS and its electoral efforts. As with Slovenski tednik and Ekspres, Škandal24 announced it will cease print publication the day after the 2018 parliamentary election, only continuing as an online publication. In late 2017, an array of over a dozen local/regional web news portals with a common template was also set up, with editors of all linked to SDS based on publicly available information. The websites mostly contained informative content, publishing local news with occasional articles that promoted SDS&#x27; candidates and narrative/agenda subtly mixed in. The sites may have been set up primarily as a political propaganda effort in anticipation of the 2018 Slovenian local elections.

=== International affiliations ===
The SDS is a member of the International Democracy Union. SDS politicians have participated in the International Visitor Leadership Program, and with the International Republican Institute.

The party is supported by and closely affiliated with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán (Fidesz). SDS&#x27;s committed backing of Fidesz has reportedly been the decisive factor in preventing Fidesz&#x27;s expulsion from the European People&#x27;s Party, resulting in a more lenient suspension. In a letter to the EPP leader, Janša warned of an &quot;inevitable&quot; split in the EPP if the vote to expel Fidesz were to take place. The 3rd Janša government began reorienting Slovenia&#x27;s foreign alliances away from core EU countries and towards the Visegrád Group of countries, with Janša calling the countries &quot;our friends in the region&quot;. 

In 2024, when the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán (Fidesz) formed the Patriots for Europe, a new EU political group. The SDS, which has four MEPs, ultimately remained part of the EPP Group, while noting that not all SDS MEPs agreed with this decision.

== Public profile ==
=== Controversies and criticism ===
In March 2021, the association of state prosecutors of Slovenia addressed a letter to the Council of Europe to voice their concerns about government pressure on prosecutors (including by PM Janša, and SDS-affiliated media). The third Janša government refused to confirm the appointment of delegated prosecutors to the EU public prosecutors office that is to scrutinise potential misuse of EU funds (both nominees had previously made prosecutorial decisions that were politically disfavourable to SDS, with one having helped bring graft charges against Janša), as well as refusing to confirm 14 prosecutors nominated by the judiciary leading to understaffing of the state prosecutorship. PM Janša also pressured the chief state prosecutor to pursue criminal charges against anti-government protesters who used a slogan that Janša interpreted as a death threat to him and his supporters, admonishing him in a missive that &quot;[He] will be directly responsible for any potential victim of the organised death threats.&quot;

In June 2021, the top officials of four independent state oversight institutions issued a joint statement warning of persistent political pressure, impeding their work.

In 2021, articles published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and in &quot;Der Standard&quot; described SDS as waging a culture war by trying to shift the country&#x27;s museums in a more conservative and patriotic direction by appointing like-minded people in leadership positions within the institutions.

=== Freedom of the press ===
SDS holds that Slovenian news media is biased and favours the left. Shortly after assuming the role of PM for the third time, SDS leader Janez Janša published an essay entitled &quot;War with the media&quot; in which he expounded his views on countering an oppositional news media, concluding that the battle against the &quot;monopoly of lies&quot; cannot be won without a fight.

SDS and their allies have cultivated an ecosystem of party-aligned media outlets that include a TV channel, news websites (including a number of regional news websites), magazines, a tabloid, and a press agency. There was also an effort to set up a radio station. Some of the party&#x27;s media endavours were strategically undertaken just prior to upcoming elections; regional news websites began operating prior to local elections, for example. SDS-affiliated outlets have been accused of false reporting and fake news, of publishing hateful and defamatory content, and of publishing racist, xenophobic, homophobic, and antisemitic content. Some SDS-affiliated media projects have received financial backing from businesses affiliated with the party&#x27;s political ally, Hungarian PM Viktor Orbán.

Janša has also adopted a pugnacious approach to media relations, aggressively responding to almost every critical foreign press article on the political situation in Slovenia under his leadership. SDS has been criticised for their adversarial approach to media relations, which not only chilled media freedom in the country, but also created a climate where personal attacks, harassment, and threats are commonplace for journalists that have landed in the party&#x27;s crosshairs. In a letter to top EU officials, various media freedom organisations also warned that PM Janša could use his European presidency position to &quot;attack journalists&quot; across the EU and normalise such behaviour among EU functionaries.

First Janša cabinet: During Janša&#x27;s first government, the party was accused of gaining influence over multiple public and private outlets, and pulling advertising from state-owned companies from outlets that reported critically about the government. To bring the country&#x27;s largest newspaper under its control, Janša personally arranged a corrupt deal with the owner of the newspaper in which state assets were traded in exchange for editorial control over the newspaper.

Third Janša cabinet: Shortly after Janša&#x27;s third government took office, a loyalist (who had been previously appointed editor-in-chief of the country&#x27;s largest newspaper during Janša&#x27;s first government, reportedly in a secret corrupt deal between Janša and the newspaper&#x27;s owner) was appointed to head SiOL, a media subsidiary of a state-owned telecom, despite receiving the approval of only 2 members of the 42-member editorial board. In fall of 2020, the state telecom commenced the sale of TSMedia which owns SiOL. In May 2021, the board of directors of the telecom abruptly halted the sale after a Hungarian business with ties to Hungary&#x27;s ruling party Fidesz (which is closely allied with SDS) was outbid 2 million € to 5 million € by another bidder.

In May 2020, the government replaced 7 board members of the public broadcaster RTV Slovenia, shifting the political balance of power of the board in favour of the government and foreshadowing a push to replace the leadership of the institution. In October 2020, board members close to SDS and the government began an attempt to replace the then general director of the institution before the end of his term, citing poor financial management and attacks on government representatives. Commenting on the replacement push, the director said the attempt was motivated by a desire to purge RTV of journalists critical of the government. The vote to replace the director was held in November, and failed by 1 vote. With the end of the regular term of the previous director approaching, a new general director was elected in January 2021, to take office in April. While SDS failed to field a loyal candidate, votes of board members close to the government were decisive in picking the new head. Shortly after a new RTV director was chosen, PM Janša commented on a clip of RTV footage with &quot;hopefully the new broom will fix such false reporting&quot;, leading to fears that the new director will be beholden to the government after its board members supported his nomination.

During the summer of 2020, the government proposed new media laws that would increase the government&#x27;s influence over the state-owned press agency Slovenian Press Agency (STA), and redirect some funds from the public broadcaster to an SDS-affiliated TV channel. The proposed legislation failed to gain traction after facing objections from all coalition partners. After STA refused to provide a government agency with business information and explanations about editorial decisions (STA argued the government agency lacked legal authority to demand such information), the government, in an unprecedented move, halted financing the news agency, saying STA had failed to meet its contractual obligations. The loss of state financing - some half of its total revenue - imperiled STA&#x27;s continued existence. All coalition partners called for the resumption of STA financing. In early 2021, the government proposed draft legislation that would move STA into a centrally managed pension wealth fund, granting the government greater sway over the news agency. In March 2021, PM Janša called on the STA director to resign before the end of his term, calling him a &quot;tool of the far left&quot; who should be &quot;held responsible for his unlawful actions&quot;. Janša also said that STA has been &quot;selling lies as truth&quot; under his leadership. The government also called on the STA board of directors to dismiss the director, and drafted a report accusing the director of dereliction of duty and wrongdoing in his official role. The government then requested the Interior Ministry to look into whether the findings of the report warrant a criminal investigation of the director. Police investigators subsequently questioned a STA board member and representatives of STA and the Dnevnik newspaper (due to an advertisement contract with STA), with the latter stating that the investigators asked for information that constituted business secrets, which Dnevnik refused to furnish.

In May 2021, after a criminal complaint was lodged by the government, police launched an investigation of Mladina for allegedly publishing classified information. The weekly published the contents of an internal government document (which was released to the public within a fortnight). The magazine responded by claiming the publication of the document was in the public interest (and thus legal) and that the government illegitimately restricted access to the document, and said the probe was intimidation.

PM Janša furtively met with the owner of POP TV&#x27;s parent company (the Czechia-based PPF group) in late 2020. According to people present at the meeting with knowledge of the discussion, Janša spent most of the meeting complained about POP TV&#x27;s political coverage. A deal was reportedly struck with the owners of POP TV (the most influential national TV broadcaster which also operates the most frequently visited web news portal in the country), granting lucrative government infrastructure contracts and stakes in state-owned enterprises in exchange for favourable coverage. After the meeting, the parent company begun to closely monitor POP TV&#x27;s political reporting to ensure coverage is sufficiently favourable to the SDS-led government, requiring news editors to translate transcripts into Czech and send them to headquarters in Prague. Employees of the media company confirmed mounting editorial pressure in anonymous interviews. SDS was reportedly also engineering a sale of the country&#x27;s largest newspaper Delo to PPF from its domestic owner to also reign in its critical coverage, using lucrative state contracts and benefits as enticements/punishments.

In May 2021, the Ministry of Culture, which is responsible for distributing a fixed amount of financial aid to media organisations, denied funding requests from multiple mainstream media organisations that had consistently received funding in the past (due to ostensibly unbalanced coverage) while newly apportioning the funds to multiple conservative and pro-government media organisations (multiple of which had ties to government parties); nearly all requests from conservative and pro-government media were granted. The criteria for distributing the funds had not changed. The committee responsible for distributing the funds was mostly composed of individuals with ties to SDS. The minister of culture described the shift in funding as a step towards a more balanced media environment.

SDS&#x27;s aggressiveness towards national and international news media and journalists has caused concern and drawn reprimands from EU politicians and institutions as Janša is poised to take over the leadership of the rotating EU Council presidency during the second half of 2021. In March 2021, the US State Department said it was monitoring the state of the news media in Slovenia. A deterioration in press freedoms in the country under the new government was subsequently noted in the State Department&#x27;s international Human Rights report for 2020 published later the same month; media freedom was described as one of the key human rights concerns in Slovenia. The issue of media freedom in Slovenia came under discussion of the European Parliament and its Democracy, Rule of Law and Fundamental Rights Monitoring Group (DRFMG). The first discussion was held on March 5 under the auspices of DRFMG; PM Janša and Culture Minister Vasko Simoniti were invited to participate but declined. The issue was also discussed by the EP during a plenary session some days later. DRFMG again discussed the issue on March 26, with the invitation to join again extended to the Slovene PM and Culture Minister. Janša initially joined discussion, but demanded a video be shown to the committee. Janša then abruptly left the videoconference after a heated exchange with the committee chair that denied his request. Janša later wrote on Twitter that he was censored by the committee. A Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights report published in June 2021 found a deterioration of press freedom in Slovenia and called on the Slovene government to remedy the situation. PM Janša, responding to the report by tweet, called the Commissioner a &quot;[...] part of #fakenews network. Well paid by our money.&quot;

=== Astroturfing and satellite parties ===
SDS reportedly operates a network of fake social media accounts used to amplify its message and attack opponents. In February 2021, an SDS MP was revealed to operate a fake Twitter account. SDS has been reported to operate a &quot;multimedia centre&quot; from within its party headquarters from where party operatives engage in social media battles with political opponents and promote the party online. The party&#x27;s online activities intensify prior to elections. A disgruntled former SDS MP publicly corroborated the existence of the &quot;multimedia centre&quot; after leaving the party, claiming he personally used to participate in the party&#x27;s media operations. There have also been claims that all SDS political candidates are required to set up a Twitter account.

In 2019, a former SDS politician published a screenshot of private messages from Janša after a public falling-out between the two. In the messages, Janša asked her to organise astroturfed protests in front of the parliament during a parliamentary deliberation about a referendum on immigration, saying &quot;protests are effective if the action comes from below and looks like a spontaneous uprising&quot;.

SDS has been accused of orchestrating the creation of at least five satellite parties in attempts to sure up a larger swath of the electorate and secure loyal coalition partners, and undermine competing parties.

=== Ties to far-right groups ===
SDS has been criticised for alleged links to a neo-Nazi extremist group; the Slovene branch of Blood &amp; Honour. The journalist who uncovered the links (Anuška Delić) was charged with leaking confidential information. The state intelligence agency, SOVA, headed by an SDS appointee at the time of the indictment, inadvertently confirmed allegations made by Delić by stating that the information revealed in the reports was consistent with findings of an ongoing investigation into the activities of the violent extremist group. SOVA argued that the information revealed in the reports could not have been obtained by any other means than by gaining access to information collected during the agency&#x27;s covert investigations, and that the publication disrupted its efforts to monitor the group by alerting B &amp; H of the monitoring efforts. Delić alleged the charges were &quot;politically motivated&quot;.

Some Blood &amp; Honour members were allegedly also members of SDS, and formally met with SDS MP Branko Grims. The group (the members of which allegedly received training by members of the Slovenian armed forces on an army training area, borrowed army weaponry (a rocket launcher), attempted to purchase handguns, and were in direct correspondence with Anders Breivik by both mail and e-mail, with multiple B &amp; H members receiving his manifesto before Breivik&#x27;s killing spree) was allegedly intimately implicated in orchestrating the violent riots which took place amid the 2012–13 Slovenian protests. The organised group of violent agitators that disrupted a major protest in Ljubljana was found to have been trained, hired, and compensated, possibly by a political party, according to a police investigation.

More recently, SDS has also fostered ties with Generation Identity Slovenia, the Slovenian chapter of the far-right Identitarian movement organisations. In August 2018, the party&#x27;s publishing company, New Horizons, anonymously published the Slovene Identitarians&#x27; alt-right book, &quot;Manifesto for the Homeland&quot;. The book was also promoted by SDS-affiliated media organisations and individuals, including SDS leader Janez Janša, with SDS MP Žan Mahnič even going so far as to post on Twitter a photo of the book taken from his parliamentary seat, with the floor of the parliamentary chamber in the background. SDS also organised a joint panel discussion on migrations with Generation Identity, and Generation Identity was advertised on an SDS-affiliated TV channel. The leader of the Austrian Identitarians, Martin Sellner, publicly thanked Janša for his support on Twitter. Sellner was at the time being investigated by Austrian authorities and ostracised by the ruling conservative Freedom Party of Austria for his financial ties with the Christchurch terrorist.

During the 2020 Slovenian anti-government protests against the Third Janša government, a pro-government counter-protester group (the &quot;Yellow Wests&quot;) was favourably covered in SDS-affiliated media, with the articles in which the Yellow Wests called on the public to join them shared by PM Janša on Twitter. 8 of the 30-some original Yellow Wests (including their spokesman) were found to have links to neo-Nazism. In 2021, the group forcefully disrupted an anti-government rally in the vicinity of a state ceremony attended by multiple foreign prime ministers. Riot police removed the provocators to avoid a massive brawl.

=== Political self-dealing accusations ===
The party has been accused of political self-dealing and nepotism, appointing relatives, allies, and friends to government (and other) positions. Many close relatives of prominent SDS members have found employment in the Slovenian and European parliaments, high ranking public sector positions, and state-owned companies (some despite not meeting the official job requirements).

SDS has been accused of political firings and replacements in, and selective financing of many institutions under the public sphere, and creating an environment where politisation of the public workplace was permissible and pervasive while in power.

=== Cult of personality ===
SDS leader Janez Janša has continuously served as party head since 1993 without a single other contender for the post. Party members are extremely loyal to Janša; it has been noted that the party appears to resemble a cult, with numerous past members claiming that Janša leads the party in an authoritarian manner and that no dissent is tolerated. SDS MEP Romana Jordan Cizelj was reportedly the only one within the party leadership to openly voice her doubts about Janša&#x27;s continued leadership of the party whilst serving a prison sentence for corruption. Jordan Cizelj was subsequently not allowed to run for re-election as MEP on the SDS ticket as punishment for her disloyalty to Janša.

=== Campaign financing impropriety allegations ===
In the run-up to the 2018 Slovenian parliamentary election, SDS attempted to receive a loan of €450,000 from an individual residing in Bosnia and Herzegovina to fund its electoral campaign. The party came into contact with the individual via Nova obzorja publishing company (partially owned by SDS). SDS also put up its share in Nova obzorja as collateral. The sum borrowed exceeded limits set by campaign finance laws, however, and SDS was obliged to return the borrowed funds. A police and financial court investigation was also triggered after the terms of the loan became public. An investigation into the lender was also launched, based on suspicions of money laundering, tax avoidance, destruction and falsification of business documents, and overseeing dummy companies. The individual was allegedly a part of a criminal organisation managing dummy companies that received funds of undisclosed origins (including the funds later loaned to SDS).

Less than a week before the 2018 parliamentary election took place, it was revealed that media/publishing companies closely affiliated and partially owned by SDS received some €800,000 from two Hungarian nationals (or, rather, their companies) - both with close ties to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán - months before the election, bringing the total amount SDS-affiliated media companies received from Hungarian entities to over €2.2M. The SDS-affiliated media companies that received the funds in turn purchased campaign adds for SDS. Nova obzorja publishing company also attempted to loan €60,000 to the party. The same Hungarian individuals also provided funds for political allies in Macedonia. It is furthermore also known that the loan SDS attempted to obtain from a Bosnian citizen some months earlier had a Hungarian connection. SDS-controlled media companies have reportedly also served as a conduit for Hungarian financing of media in North Macedonia to prop up Orban&#x27;s political allies there. Of the at least €4M in Hungarian moneys that were reportedly originally funneled into SDS-affiliated media between mid-2018 and early 2020, over €2.5M was then channeled to Macedonian news media entities favourable to the right-wing VMRO-DPMNE party.

=== Discriminatory remarks ===
After the 2011 parliamentary elections, which saw the victory of Ljubljana mayor Zoran Janković (who is of Serbian descent) and his party, a contribution published on the official SDS webpage by a &quot;Tomaž Majer&quot; caused considerable public outrage. Majer states that Janković was elected by &quot;well-disciplined new citizens&quot; living in &quot;high-rise neighbourhoods&quot;, tracksuit-clad voters with foreign accents arriving at polling places in groups holding notes with instructions on whom to vote for. These &quot;new citizens&quot; were allegedly mobilised by being admonished their citizenship will be revoked if &quot;the right&quot; is elected. Majer further states that one of his acquaintances (who is of Bosnian descent) was even offered monetary reward to vote for Janković. Majer also claims that the roughly 1/3 of Janković voters of Slovenian descent were ordered to vote for PS by Milan Kučan and Janez Stanovnik. Several media organisations attempted to identify the author, but were unsuccessful. It has been speculated that the real author of the text was in fact Janez Janša, based on similar known past statements (specifically, his 1993 commentary on the poor electoral performance of SDS during the 1992 elections). In the wake of the 2011 election, Janša and several other SDS MPs and candidates expressed similar but somewhat toned-down nationalistic sentiments while commenting on the election and its winner. The public reaction culminated in a &quot;March of the Tracksuits&quot;, a rally where participants attended clothed in tracksuits to protest against division and intolerance.

SDS MP Branko Grims, speaking to a gathering of a ultranationalist group in early 2018, said &quot;Now is the era of Trump. He is the greatest thorn in the foot of the globalists, who control the US mechanisms, with Soros at the helm. Soros is the symbol of this. But there&#x27;s also the Rothschilds and many other wealthiest families of financial speculators.&quot;

SDS MP Marijan Pojbič, in a 2017 Statehood Day address on Facebook, called for &quot;No more mayors that aren&#x27;t real Slovenes, and even fewer national politicians who aren&#x27;t real Slovenes by birth.&quot;

In 2020, SDS politician Žan Mahnič, a former MP then serving as national security state secretary, shared a tweet of an image of white-skinned women with different hair colours accompanied with the comment &quot;This is all the diversity Europe needs.&quot; The original author of the tweet was a user using the screen name &quot;franca - EtnoNacionalist&quot;. Mahnič was subsequently criticised for promoting racism.

In 2021, PM Janša shared a tweet saying that the amount &quot;death, suffering, repression, desolation and societal backwardness&quot; caused by The Communist Manifesto is second only to the Quran. The tweet was condemned by the Slovenian Muslim community, and the Turkish national broadcaster. Janša defended sharing the tweet by noting that his Twitter profile bio says re-tweets are not endorsements.

<text>Derek Armstrong (born April 23, 1973) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and former player. Armstrong played in the National Hockey League, where he played for the New York Islanders, Ottawa Senators, New York Rangers, Los Angeles Kings and the St. Louis Blues.

==Playing career==
Derek Armstrong spent the majority of his NHL career with the Los Angeles Kings. After being taken by the New York Islanders in the 6th round, 128th overall of the 1992 NHL Entry Draft, Armstrong finally played his first full NHL campaign in the 2002–03 season, after having spent eight years in the minor leagues. Most of his non-NHL stints were in the two &quot;AAA&quot; North American development leagues: American Hockey League and International Hockey League.

Due to the NHL lockout, as some NHL players did, Armstrong went to Europe, to play hockey in the Swiss National League A, for SC Rapperswil-Jona, totaling 17 points in only 12 games. Statistically, his best season was the 2006–07 campaign when he had 44 points as seventh place in Kings&#x27; points that year.

Armstrong signed with the St. Louis Blues on September 8, 2009, where he finished his final pro season playing for his former LA King coach, Andy Murray.

==Coaching career==
On April 11, 2012, Armstrong was named head coach of the Denver Cutthroats of the Central Hockey League. Despite his NHL career, he is best known in Denver for being part of the Denver Grizzlies&#x27; 1994-95 Turner Cup championship in the team&#x27;s only season in Denver (though they later moved to Salt Lake City and become the Utah Grizzlies, the team&#x27;s success is widely credited for attracting the Quebec Nordiques to Denver that following offseason, where they became the Colorado Avalanche). After two seasons with the Denver Cutthroats as head coach, Armstrong was then appointed as team president.

<doc id="425730" wikidata="Q2299834" url="?curid=425730" title="Tautog">
<text>The tautog (Tautoga onitis), also known as the blackfish, is a species of wrasse native to the western Atlantic Ocean from Nova Scotia to South Carolina. This species inhabits hard substrate habitats in inshore waters at depths from . It is currently the only known member of its genus.

Barlett (1848) wrote, &quot;[Tautaug] is a Native American word, and may be found in Roger Williams&#x27; &quot;Key to the Indian Language&quot;.&quot; The name is from the Narragansett language, originally &quot;tautauog&quot; (pl. of &quot;taut&quot;). It is also called a &quot;black porgy&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot; Japanese black porgy), &quot;chub&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot; the freshwater chub), &quot;oyster-fish&quot; (in North Carolina) or &quot;blackfish&quot; (in New York/New Jersey, New England).

==Description==

Tautog are brown and dark olive, with white blotches, and have plump, elongated bodies. They have a typical weight of and reach a maximum length and weight of and , respectively.

Tautog have many adaptations to life in and around rocky areas. They have thick, rubbery lips and powerful jaws. The backs of their throats contain a set of teeth resembling molars. Together, these are used to pick and crush prey such as mollusks and crustaceans. Their skin also has a rubbery quality with a heavy slime covering, which helps to protect them when swimming among rocks.

==Life cycle==

Spawning occurs offshore, in late spring to early summer. The eggs hatch and develop while drifting. All of the young take residence in shallow, protected waters and live and hide in seaweed, sea lettuce, or eelgrass beds for protection, and are green in color to camouflage themselves. During the late fall, they move offshore and winter in a state of reduced activity.

==Cuisine==

Goode (1884) said, &quot;The tautog has always been a favorite table fish, especially in New York, its flesh being white, dry, and of a delicate flavor.&quot;

Davidson recommends grilling, baking, and using it in fish chowder.

==Sports fishing==

Popular among fishermen, tautog have a reputation for being a particularly tricky fish to catch. Part of this is because of their tendency to live among rocks and other structures that can cause a fisherman&#x27;s line to get snagged. The favorite baits for tautog include green crabs, Asian shore crabs, fiddler crabs, clams, shrimp, mussels, sandworms, and lobsters. Tautog fishing may also be difficult due to the tendency of fishermen to try to set the hook as soon as they feel a hit, rather than waiting for the tautog to swallow the bait. Rigs with minimal beads, swivels, and hooks should be used to prevent entanglement with the rocks, reefs, or wrecks that tautog frequent.

Because they are found in wrecks, they are often seen by scuba divers. They are also popular with spearfishermen.

==Management==
Slow reproduction and growth make tautog more vulnerable to overfishing. The species is managed by focusing on reducing fishing mortality rates, as well as restrictions on gear, size limits, possession limits, and limited fishing seasons. At present, the Blue Ocean Institute recommends that consumers avoid eating this fish because the populations are at low levels that are not considered sustainable.

Around 1920, 750 tons were harvested annually off the New England coast.

<doc id="425733" wikidata="Q2348210" url="?curid=425733" title="Emma Smith">
<text>Emma Hale Smith Bidamon (July 10, 1804 – April 30, 1879) was a leader in the early Latter Day Saint movement and a prominent member of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church) as well as the first wife of Joseph Smith, the movement&#x27;s founder. In 1842, when the Ladies&#x27; Relief Society of Nauvoo was formed as a women&#x27;s service organization, she was elected by its members as the organization&#x27;s first president.

After the killing of Joseph Smith, Emma remained in Nauvoo rather than following Brigham Young and the Mormon pioneers to the Utah Territory. Emma was supportive of Smith&#x27;s teachings throughout her life with the exception of plural marriage and remained loyal to her son, Joseph Smith III, in his leadership of the RLDS Church.

==Early life and first marriage, 1804–1829==

=== Early life ===
Emma Hale was born on July 10, 1804, in Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, in her family&#x27;s log cabin. She was the seventh child and third daughter of Isaac Hale and Elizabeth Lewis Hale. She was descended of primarily English ancestors, including seven passengers on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. Isaac and Elizabeth arrived in Susquehanna County in 1791 where they bought land and became the first permanent settlers.

Isaac and Elizabeth were members of the first Methodist Episcopal congregation in Harmony, where Emma&#x27;s uncle preached. Beginning at age seven or eight, Emma was involved in the church, reading the Bible and singing hymns. Emma&#x27;s father stepped away from the church for a time and became a deist, but later returned to the church after Emma&#x27;s requests.

The Hale family was relatively wealthy. Isaac hunted and Elizabeth hosted lodgers and boarders in their home. The Hale family was known for being honest, hard-working, and generous to their neighbors.

Throughout her childhood, Emma was interested in religion, canoeing, and riding horses. Emma learned how to read and write and was considered to be intelligent. She attended a girls school for a year and taught school in Harmony when she returned.

=== Courtship and marriage to Joseph ===

Emma first met her future husband, Joseph Smith Jr., in 1825. Joseph lived near Palmyra, New York, but boarded with the Hales in Harmony while he was employed in a company of men hired by Josiah Stowell and one of Emma&#x27;s relatives to dig for money on the Hale family property. Rumors about Joseph having a unique ability to find hidden treasure caused Stowell to offer him a high wage. Although the company was unsuccessful in finding the suspected mine and Emma&#x27;s father eventually turned against the project, Joseph and Emma secretly met without her family&#x27;s approval several times at a friend&#x27;s house during the dig and after while Joseph was working as farmhand nearby. When Emma and Joseph spoke to the Hales to receive a blessing on their marriage, Isaac and Elizabeth Hale refused; possibly because Isaac wanted Emma to marry a neighbor and he considered Joseph to be a &quot;stranger&quot; and possibly because of Joseph&#x27;s failed money-digging operation on the Hales&#x27; land. On January 17, 1827, Joseph and Emma left the Stowell house and traveled to the house of Zachariah Tarbill in South Bainbridge, New York, where they were married the following day.

On September 22, 1827, Joseph and Emma took a horse and carriage belonging to Joseph Knight, Sr., and went to a hill, now known as Hill Cumorah, where Joseph said he received a set of golden plates. The announcement of Joseph having the plates created a great deal of excitement in the area. In December 1827, with financial support from Martin Harris, the couple accepted an invitation from Emma&#x27;s parents to move to Harmony. 

The Hales helped Emma and Joseph obtain a house and a small farm. Once they settled in, Joseph began work on the Book of Mormon, with Emma acting as a scribe. She became a physical witness of the plates, reporting that she felt them through a cloth, traced the pages through the cloth with her fingers, heard the metallic sound they made as she moved them, and felt their weight. She later wrote in an interview with her son, Joseph Smith III: &quot;In writing for your father I frequently wrote day after day, often sitting at the table close by him, he sitting with his face buried in his hat, with the stone in it, and dictating hour after hour with nothing between us.&quot; In Harmony on June 15, 1828, Emma gave birth to her first childa son named Alvinwho lived only a few hours. He was buried east of their house. For the next two weeks, Emma remained gravely ill.

Due to increased hostility towards Joseph as he worked on the Book of Mormon, Emma and Joseph went to live with David Whitmer in Fayette, New York, to finish the Book of Mormon. While there, both Emma and a schoolteacher named Oliver Cowdery worked as Joseph&#x27;s scribes. Joseph received a copyright for the Book of Mormon in June 1829 and the book was published in March 1830.

==&quot;Elect lady&quot; and the early church, 1830–1839==

On April 6, 1830, Joseph and five other men established the Church of Christ. Emma was baptized by Oliver Cowdery on June 28, 1830, in Colesville, New York, surrounded by a group of mocking people. Later that evening before the confirmation service, Joseph was arrested for being a disorderly person and causing an uproar by preaching the Book of Mormon. A few days later, Joseph was acquitted of all charges. Emma was confirmed later by Joseph and Newl Knight.

In July 1830, Joseph received a revelation, now known as Doctrine and Covenants Section 25, that highlighted Emma Smith as &quot;an elect lady&quot;. The revelation says that Emma would &quot;be ordained under [Joseph&#x27;s] hand to expound scriptures, and to exhort the church.&quot; The revelation instructed Emma to &quot;murmur not&quot; and described Emma&#x27;s duties to Joseph. Emma was also directed to be Joseph&#x27;s scribe and to create a hymnbook for the new church.

Joseph and Emma returned to Harmony for a time, but relations with Emma&#x27;s parents remained strained. Emma&#x27;s father was displeased that Joseph and Emma were living off charity and Joseph was late to return money he borrowed to purchase a farm. Many people in Harmony also openly opposed Joseph. Emma and Joseph returned to live at David Whitmer&#x27;s farm in August 1830. This marked the last time that Emma saw her parents. Despite the rift that her marriage to Joseph created in the family, Emma did reunite with her family. She communicated with her mother through letters. Some members of her family moved to Nauvoo although they did not accept Emma&#x27;s invitation to join Mormonism.

Emma and Joseph went back to staying in the homes of members of the growing church. The couple lived first with the Whitmers in Fayette, then with Newel K. Whitney and his family in Kirtland, Ohio, and then in a cabin on a farm owned by Isaac Morley. It was here on April 30, 1831, that Emma gave birth to premature twins, Thaddeus and Louisa; both babies died hours later. That same day, Julia Clapp Murdock died giving birth to twins, Joseph and Julia. When the twins were nine days old, their father, John, gave the infants to the Smiths to raise as their own. On September 2, 1831, the Smiths moved into John Johnson&#x27;s home in Hiram, Ohio. The infant Joseph died of exposure or pneumonia in late March 1832, after a door was left open during a mob attack on Smith.
On November 6, 1832, Emma gave birth to Joseph Smith III in the upper room of Whitney&#x27;s store in Kirtland. Young Joseph (as he became known) was the first of her natural children to live to adulthood. A second son, Frederick Granger Williams Smith (named after Frederick G. Williams, a counselor in the church&#x27;s First Presidency), followed on June 29, 1836. As the Kirtland Temple was being constructed, Emma spearheaded an effort to house and clothe the construction workers.

While in Kirtland, Emma&#x27;s feelings about temperance and the use of tobacco reportedly influenced her husband&#x27;s decision to pray about dietary questions. These prayers resulted in the &quot;Word of Wisdom&quot;. Also in Kirtland, Emma&#x27;s first selection of hymns was published as a hymnal for the church&#x27;s use. During the Panic of 1837, the Kirtland Safety Society, the banking venture that Joseph and other church leaders had set up to provide financing for the growing membership, collapsed, as did many financial institutions in the United States at that time. Emma herself held stock in the Society. The bank&#x27;s demise led to serious problems for the church and the Smith family. Joseph received revelation from God to leave Kirtland for the safety of his family, and on January 12, 1838, Joseph left for Missouri. Many faithful saints soon followed.

Emma and her family followed and made a new home on the frontier in the Latter Day Saint settlement of Far West, Missouri, where Emma gave birth on June 2, 1838, to Alexander Hale Smith. Events of the 1838 Mormon War soon escalated, resulting in Joseph&#x27;s surrender and imprisonment by Missouri officials. Emma and her family were forced to leave the state, along with most other church members. She crossed the Mississippi River, which had frozen over in February 1839. Of these times, she later wrote:

==Early years in Nauvoo, 1839–1844==
Emma and her family lived with friendly non-Mormons John and Sarah Cleveland in Quincy, Illinois, until Joseph escaped custody in Missouri. The family moved to a new Latter Day Saint settlement in Illinois which Joseph named &quot;Nauvoo&quot;. On May 10, 1839, they moved into a two-story log house in Nauvoo that they called the &quot;Homestead&quot;. On June 13, 1840, Emma gave birth to a son, Don Carlos, named after his uncle Don Carlos Smith, Joseph&#x27;s brother. Both Don Carlos Smiths would die the next year. The Smiths lived in the homestead until 1843, when a much larger house, known as the &quot;Mansion House&quot; was built across the street. A wing (no longer extant) was added to this house, which Emma operated as a hotel. She often took in young girls in need of work, giving them jobs as maids.

On March 17, 1842, the Ladies&#x27; Relief Society of Nauvoo was formally organized as the women&#x27;s auxiliary to the church. Emma became its founding president, with Sarah M. Cleveland and Elizabeth Ann Whitney as her counselors. She had persuaded John Taylor and Joseph Smith to call the organization the &quot;Relief Society&quot; instead of the &quot;Benevolent Society&quot;. The &quot;Latter-Day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia&quot; records that Emma Smith &quot;filled [the position] with marked distinction as long as the society continued to hold meetings in that city [Nauvoo]&quot;. She saw upholding morality as the primary purpose of the Relief Society. As &quot;protecting the morals of the community&quot; became her mission, Smith supported the public confession of sins; on this subject, Smith called the women of Nauvoo to repentance with &quot;all the frankness of a Methodist exhorter.&quot; She served as president of the Relief Society until 1844. According to the minutes of the founding meeting, the organization was formed to &quot;provoke the brethren to good works in looking to the wants of the poor, [search] after objects of charity [and] to assist by correcting the virtues of the female community&quot;. Shortly before this, Joseph had initiated the Anointed Quoruma prayer circle of important church members that included Emma. As she had in Kirtland, Emma Smith led &quot;the work of boarding and clothing the men engaged in building [the Nauvoo temple]&quot;. She also traveled with a committee to Quincy, Illinois, to present Illinois governor Thomas Carlin &quot;a memorial ... in behalf of her people&quot; after the Latter Day Saints had experienced persecution in the state.

Rumors concerning polygamy and other practices surfaced by 1842. Emma publicly condemned polygamy and denied any involvement by her husband. Emma authorized and was the main signatory of a petition in summer 1842 with a thousand female signatures, denying Joseph Smith was connected with polygamy. As president of the Ladies&#x27; Relief Society, she authorized the publishing of a certificate in October 1842 denouncing polygamy and denying her husband as its creator or participant.

In June 1844, the press of the &quot;Nauvoo Expositor,&quot; a newspaper published by disaffected former church members, was destroyed by the town marshal on orders from the town council (of which Joseph was a member). This set into motion the events that ultimately led to Joseph&#x27;s arrest and incarceration in the jail in Carthage, Illinois. A mob of about 200 armed men stormed the jail in the late afternoon of June 27, 1844, and both Joseph and his brother Hyrum were killed.

==Later years in Nauvoo, 1844–1879==
Upon Joseph&#x27;s death, Emma was left a pregnant widow. On November 17, 1844, she gave birth to David Hyrum Smith, the last child that she and Joseph had together. In addition to being church president, Joseph had been trustee-in-trust for the church. As a result, his estate was entirely wrapped up with the finances of the church. Joseph had also been in debt when he died, leaving the responsibility to pay it on Emma Smith&#x27;s shoulders. Untangling the church&#x27;s debts and property from Emma&#x27;s personal debts and property proved to be a long and complicated process for Emma and her family.

Debates about who should be Joseph&#x27;s successor as the leader of the church also involved Emma. Emma wanted William Marks, president of the church&#x27;s central stake, to assume the church presidency, but Marks favored Sidney Rigdon for the role. After a meeting on August 8, a congregation of the church voted that the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles should lead the church. Brigham Young, president of the quorum, then became the de facto president of the church in Nauvoo.

Relations between Young and Emma steadily deteriorated. Some of Emma&#x27;s friends, as well as many members of the Smith family, alienated themselves from Young&#x27;s followers. Conflicts between church members and neighbors also continued to escalate, and eventually Young made the decision to relocate the church to the Salt Lake Valley. When he and the majority of the Latter Day Saints of Nauvoo abandoned the city in early 1846, Emma and her children remained behind in the emptied town.

Nearly two years later, a close friend and non-Mormon, Major Lewis C. Bidamon, proposed marriage and became Emma&#x27;s second husband on December 23, 1847. A Methodist minister performed the ceremony. Bidamon moved into the Mansion House and became stepfather to Emma&#x27;s children. She and Bidamon had no children of their own. Emma and Bidamon attempted to operate a store and to continue using their large house as a hotel, but Nauvoo had too few residents and visitors to make either venture very profitable. Emma and her family remained rich in real estate but poor in capital.

Unlike other members of the Smith family who had at times favored the claims of James J. Strang or William Smith, Emma and her children continued to live in Nauvoo as unaffiliated Latter Day Saints. Many Latter Day Saints believed that her eldest son, Joseph Smith III, would one day be called to hold the same position that his father had held. When he reported receiving a calling from God to take his father&#x27;s place as head of a &quot;New Organization&quot; of the Latter Day Saint church, she supported his decision. Both she and Joseph III traveled to a conference at Amboy, Illinois. On April 6, 1860, Joseph was sustained as president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which prefaced &quot;Reorganized&quot; to its name in 1872 and in 2001 became known as the Community of Christ. Emma became a member of the RLDS Church without rebaptism, as her original 1830 baptism was still considered valid.

Emma and Joseph III returned to Nauvoo after the conference and he led the church from there until moving to Plano, Illinois, in 1866. Joseph III called upon his mother to help prepare a hymnal for the reorganization, just as she had for the early church.

Smith and Bidamon bought and renovated a portion of the unfinished Nauvoo House in 1869. A few visitors from Brigham Young&#x27;s faction of the Latter-day Saints came from Utah Territory to visit Smith at this house. Emma died peacefully in the Nauvoo House on April 30, 1879, at the age of 74. Her funeral was held May 2, 1879, in Nauvoo with RLDS Church minister Mark Hill Forscutt preaching the sermon.

==Hymns and hymnals==

Alongside W. W. Phelps, Emma Smith compiled a Latter Day Saint hymnal, published in 1835. It was titled &quot;A Collection of Sacred Hymns, for the Church of the Latter Day Saints&quot; and contained 90 hymn texts but no music. Forty-eight were written by Latter Day Saints, and the remaining forty-two were not. The texts borrowed from Protestant groups were often changed slightly to reinforce the theology of the early church. For example, Hymn 15 changed Isaac Watts&#x27;s Joy to the World from a song about Christmas to a song about the return of Christ (see Joy to the World (Phelps)). Many of these changes and a large number of the original songs included in the hymnal are attributed to W. W. Phelps.

Emma also compiled a second hymnal by the same title, which was published in Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1841. This contained 304 hymn texts.

When her son Joseph III became president of the RLDS Church, she was again asked to compile a hymnal. &quot;Latter Day Saints&#x27; Selection of Hymns&quot; was published in 1861.

==Polygamy==

Polygamy caused a breach between Joseph and Emma. Historian Laurel Thatcher Ulrich argues that &quot;Emma vacillated in her support for plural marriage, sometimes acquiescing to Joseph&#x27;s sealings, sometimes resisting.&quot; Although she knew of some of her husband&#x27;s marriages, she almost certainly did not know the full extent of his polygamous activities. In 1843, Emma temporarily accepted Smith&#x27;s marriage to four women of her choosing who boarded in the Smith household, but later regretted her decision and demanded the other wives leave. That July, at his brother Hyrum&#x27;s encouragement, Joseph dictated a revelation directing Emma to accept plural marriage. Hyrum delivered the message to Emma, but she furiously rejected it. Joseph and Emma were not reconciled over the matter until September 1843, after Emma began participating in temple ceremonies, and after Joseph made other concessions to her. The next year, in March 1844, Emma publicly denounced polygamy as evil and destructive; and though she did not directly disclose Smith&#x27;s secret practice of plural marriage, she insisted that people should heed only what he taught publiclyimplicitly challenging his private promulgation of polygamy.

Despite her knowledge of polygamy, Emma publicly denied that her husband had ever taken additional wives. While Smith was still alive, Emma spoke against polygamy, and she (along with multiple other signatories directly involved in polygamy) signed an 1842 petition denying that Smith or his church endorsed the practice. After his death, she continued to deny his polygamy. When Joseph III and Alexander specifically asked about polygamy in an interview with their mother, she stated, &quot;No such thing as polygamy, or spiritual wifery, was taught, publicly or privately, before my husband&#x27;s death, that I have now, or ever had any knowledge of ... He had no other wife but me; nor did he to my knowledge ever have&quot;.

Many of the Latter Day Saints who joined the RLDS Church in the midwestern United States had broken with Brigham Young and/or James Strang because of opposition to polygamy. Emma&#x27;s continuing public denial of the practice seemed to lend strength to their cause, and opposition to polygamy became a tenet of the RLDS Church. Over the years, many RLDS Church historians have continued to state that the practice had originated with Brigham Young.

<text>Tyler Lawrence Arnason (born March 16, 1979) is an American former professional ice hockey center who played in the National Hockey League for the Chicago Blackhawks, Ottawa Senators and the Colorado Avalanche.

==Early life==
He is the son of former NHL winger Chuck Arnason. Arnason was born in Oklahoma City, when his father was a member of the Oklahoma City Stars of the Central Hockey League (CHL). As a result, Arnason holds dual citizenship to both the United States and Canada. 

Arnason and his family moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba following the end of his father&#x27;s career. He attended St. John&#x27;s-Ravenscourt School, graduating in 1997.

Arnason is the brother of Canadian actress and screenwriter Aubrey Arnason.

==Playing career==
Arnason attended St. Cloud State University and played 118 games for the men&#x27;s hockey team, registering 136 points in his three years with the team. In 2001, he led St. Cloud to the Western Collegiate Hockey Association title. 
Arnason was drafted by the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL) in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft in the seventh round, 183rd overall. In his first professional season, Arnason started out with the Blackhawks but due to poor conditioning spent most of the year with the team&#x27;s American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals. He was impressive in the AHL however, selected in the AHL All-Star game for PlanetUSA. Arnason was also awarded the Dudley &quot;Red&quot; Garrett Memorial Award as the league&#x27;s top rookie, and was named to the league&#x27;s All-Rookie team. 

In the 2002–03 season, his first full season in the NHL, Arnason was named NHL Rookie of the Month in October played in the NHL Youngstars Game and was named in the All-Rookie team. During the season, Arnason recorded his first career NHL hat trick, scoring all three Chicago goals in a 3–3 tie versus the San Jose Sharks on December 28. His best season was in 2003–04 when he amassed 55 points. While playing with Chicago he was part of the &quot;ABC&quot; line with two other young forwards, Mark Bell and Kyle Calder. In the very early morning of January 21, 2003, Arnason was involved in an off-ice incident. Arnason, Phil Housley and Theoren Fleury were leaving the Pure Platinum strip club in Columbus, Ohio when Fleury punched the club&#x27;s manager in the face. Housley and Arnason had to step in to prevent Fleury from being beaten by the bouncers. On August 11, 2005, Arnason re-signed with the Blackhawks for one year.

By the 2005–06 NHL season, Arnason was no longer a prospect and was considered as having not played to his potential. With the Blackhawks that season, Arnason had tallied 13 goals and 41 points in 60 games when, on March 9, 2006, he was traded to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Brandon Bochenski and a second-round pick in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft. Ottawa&#x27;s intent was for Arnason to center the second line. In the nineteen games he played for Ottawa in the regular season, he registered four assists and failed to score a goal. He was a healthy scratch in the playoffs. As a restricted free agent the Senators chose not to give him a qualifying offer, so he became an unrestricted free agent.
On July 1, 2006, Arnason signed a one-year deal with the Colorado Avalanche. As his father played for the Rockies for two seasons, Arnason’s signing made him the first son of a former Rockies player to play for the Avalanche. Arnason enjoyed a return to form by posting 49 points for the Avalanche in the 2006–07 season. He was consequently awarded a two-year extension by the Avalanche on June 22, 2007. His second season with the Avalanche saw Arnason tally 10 goals and 31 points in 70 games. In his third and final season in Colorado, he registered 5 goals and 21 points in 70 games.

On July 3, 2009, Arnason signed a one-year two-way contract with the New York Rangers for the 2009–10 season. On September 17, 2009, Arnason failed to make the Rangers out of training camp and was assigned to their AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack, for the beginning of the season. On November 10, 2009, without the ambition to play in the AHL he was suspended by the Rangers and released from his contract to sign with the European team Dinamo Riga of the Kontinental Hockey League. Following a difficult transition and recording only 11 points in 26 games, Arnason&#x27;s contract was not renewed by Riga at season&#x27;s end.

Returning to North America, as a free agent, he accepted a tryout invitation to attend the Florida Panthers training camp for the 2010–11 season. Subsequently, released from the Panthers during the preseason, Arnason then initially accepted another invite to his local AHL club, the Manitoba Moose, affiliate of the Vancouver Canucks, before electing to not report to camp on September 27, 2010. Arnason then accepted a temporary contract to return to Europe, signing with Swiss team EHC Biel of the National League A (NLA) on October 14, 2010. He scored 10 points in 9 games with Biel before he moved on to EHC Visp of the National League B (NLB), signing a contract for the remainder of the season on November 11, 2010.
However, a week later, Arnason was released playing in just a single game with Visp, after both parties mutually opted to exercise an exit clause in the contract on November 18, 2010. On January 31, 2011, Arnason joined Finnish team, Espoo Blues, for the remainder of the season. However, his tenure with his new club was again short lived, as after 8 games, Arnason sought a release from the Blues to return to the United States on February 28, 2011.

On October 7, 2011, Arnason was named on the Texas Stars opening night roster for the 2011–12 AHL season. After seven games with the Stars, Arnason opted to be released from his try-out on October 29 and ended his professional career.

==International play==
Arnason played for Team USA at the 2007 IIHF World Championship. He scored in Team USA&#x27;s final game against Finland, which Finland won 5–4. Team USA finished fifth in the tournament.

<text>The Slovenian People&#x27;s Party (, , Slovene abbreviation SLS ) is a conservative, agrarian, Christian democratic political party in Slovenia. Formed in 1988 under the name of Slovenian Peasant Union as the first democratic political organization in Yugoslavia, it changed its name to Slovenian People&#x27;s Party in 1992. On 15 April 2000, it merged with the Slovene Christian Democrats to form the SLS+SKD Slovenian People&#x27;s Party, and changed its name in 2001 to Slovenian People&#x27;s Party.

SLS won seats in the National Parliament in general elections in Slovenia in the years 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2011, but missed the parliamentary threshold in 2014. SLS won 6.83% of the vote at the early 2011 Slovenian parliamentary election on 4 December 2011, thus gaining six seats in the National Assembly.
From March 2013 to December 2014, Franc Bogovič led SLS. In the 2014 European Parliamentary elections, SLS got their first seat in the European Parliament with Franc Bogovič being elected member of the European Parliament on the NSi and SLS joint-list. Despite SLS narrowly missed the parliamentary threshold in July 2014, it had been victorious in local elections in October 2014. On 6 December 2014 Marko Zidanšek took over the party, but did not manage to return to the parliament in the 2018 elections. After elections Marko Zidanšek resigned and subsequently Marjan Podobnik got elected president. In 2019 Franc Bogovič was elected member of the European Parliament once again on the SDS and SLS joint-list. Prior to the parliamentary elections in 2022, the party initiated the new movement Connect Slovenia (Povežimo Slovenijo), which consisted of the parties Konkretno, Zeleni Slovenije, New People&#x27;s Party and New Social Democracy. After the movement failed to enter the parliament, Marjan Podobnik resigned. 

In July 2022, Marko Balažic took over as president. 

==Establishment and early years==
The Slovenian People&#x27;s Party was established in May 1988 under the name of Slovenian Peasant Union (&quot;Slovenska kmečka zveza&quot;, SKZ) as the first openly non-Communist political organization in Slovenia and Yugoslavia after 1945. The establishment of the Slovenian Peasant Union is frequently considered one of the crucial events in the Slovenian Spring of 1988. In January 1989, it could register as a party. In the first multi-party election in Slovenia, the Peasant Union ran as a part of the DEMOS coalition and won 11 of the 80 seats in the Slovenian Parliament. The party&#x27;s name was changed to the current form in 1991, alluding to the pre-war Catholic conservative Slovene People&#x27;s Party. The renaming of the party caused a controversy with the Slovene Christian Democrats, who considered themselves the official heirs of the pre-war Slovene People&#x27;s Party, since the Slovene People&#x27;s Party in exile merged with the Slovene Christian Democrats in 1990.

In 1992, Marjan Podobnik was elected president of the party. Under his leadership, the Slovenian People&#x27;s Party pursued an agrarian, ethnonationalist and corporatist ideology. In 1992, the founder of the Slovenian Peasant Union Ivan Oman left the party and joined the Slovene Christian Democrats, who were then part of the ruling centrist grand coalition.

Between 1992 and 1996, the Slovene People&#x27;s Party was, together with the Slovenian National Party, the largest opposition party. Its ideology and policies were marked by a populist shift. In late 1995, representatives of the People&#x27;s Party called for a referendum to suspend the citizenship of non-ethnic Slovenes. The attempt was stopped by the Constitutional Court.

Ahead of the parliamentary election of 1996, the People&#x27;s Party formed the Slovenian Spring alliance together with the Slovene Christian Democrats (SKD), that referred to the historical Slovenian People&#x27;s Party, as well. However the alliance, was disbanded immediately after the elections, when the SLS joined a coalition government with the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia (LDS), while the SKD went into opposition. In April 2000, strains between SLS and the Liberal Democrats led to the former&#x27;s withdrawal from the coalition. In early May, SLS, SKD and SDS elected Christian democrat Andrej Bajuk prime minister instead.

==Merger==
On 15 April 2000, the Slovene Christian Democrats merged into the Slovenian People&#x27;s Party, and the abbreviation was temporarily changed to SLS+SKD to signify both predecessors. However, as early as in July of the same year rifts emerged, based on the question of a new electoral system. Therefore, Prime Minister Bajuk, Lojze Peterle, and other centrist Christian democrats left the unified party to form New Slovenia – Christian People&#x27;s Party (NSi) in August. The remaining People&#x27;s Party performed poorly in the election in October 2000, but became part of the Liberal-led coalition government of Janez Drnovšek.

==After 2004==
In the legislative election on 3 October 2004, the party won 6.8% of the popular vote and 7 out of 90 seats. Led by Janez Podobnik, the brother of former chairman Marjan Podobnik, the party entered in the centre-right government of Janez Janša.

In 2007, the mayor of Celje Bojan Šrot replaced Marjan Podobnik as president of the party. This change in leadership coincided with a policy shift. Upon his election, Šrot announced he wanted to transform the SLS in the largest centre-right party in Slovenia, thus challenging the primacy of Janez Janša&#x27;s Slovenian Democratic Party. Šrot started criticizing some of the neo-liberal reforms launched by Janša&#x27;s government, and especially Janša&#x27;s &quot;anti-tycoon&quot; policies, aimed against concentration of wealth in the hands of a small group of executive managers of privatized former state-owned firms. One of these &quot;tycoons&quot; was also Boško Šrot, Bojan Šrot&#x27;s brother, and CEO of the Laško Brewery company.

In the 2008 election the SLS ran a joint list with the Youth Party of Slovenia. In the electoral campaign, the party tried to distance itself from its former coalition allies. The joint list secured only 5 seats and 5.2% of the vote, a loss of 2 compared to the results of the SLS in 2004.

In 2009, Radovan Žerjav, former Minister of Transport in Janez Janša government, replaced Šrot as the leader of the party. Under his leadership, the SLS adopted a more moderate rhetorics. After 11 years in power, the party stayed in opposition, trying to forge an image of a constructive opposition party, supporting moderate conservative policies.

In the 2011 election, the SLS increased its support both in number of voters and in percentage, thus reversing the falling trend for the first time after the 2000 election.

In the 2014 European election, SLS ran in a joint electoral list with New Slovenia, which received 16.56% of the vote and came in second place, returning 2 MEPs.

The party received 3.98% of the vote in the Slovenian parliamentary election on 13 July 2014, narrowly missing the 4% threshold for representation in the parliament. In 2018 it received only 2.62% of the votes and next day the leader Marko Zidanšek resigned. The party decided that Primož Jelševar would lead the party until the next regular party congress.

<text>Jason William Arnott (born October 11, 1974) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player.

He began his National Hockey League career with the Edmonton Oilers in 1993–94 after being selected seventh overall in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft and was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team. A two-time NHL All-Star, Arnott won the Stanley Cup with the New Jersey Devils in 2000, scoring the championship-winning goal in the second overtime of Game 6. He played for the Dallas Stars before joining the Nashville Predators in 2006, where he served as captain for three seasons.

==Playing career==
===Minor/Junior===
Arnott grew up playing for his hometown Wasaga Beach Stars &quot;DD&quot; of the OMHA. In his Bantam year, he signed with the Stayner Siskins Jr. C. club of the OHA for the 1989–90 season. 

In 1990–91, Arnott played Jr.B. hockey for the Lindsay Century 21 Bears of the OHA. Later that year, he was selected in the first round, 16th overall, of the 1991 Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Selection by the Oshawa Generals. He was then drafted by the Edmonton Oilers in the first round, seventh overall at the 1993 NHL Entry Draft following an impressive junior career with the Generals.

===Professional===
In 1993–94, as a rookie, Arnott played 78 games as a left winger, scoring 68 points and finishing as the runner-up to future teammate Martin Brodeur for the Calder Memorial Trophy for rookie of the year. On January 4, 1998, Arnott was traded to the New Jersey Devils along with Bryan Muir in exchange for Valeri Zelepukin and Bill Guerin. As a member of the &quot;A Line&quot; on the Devils with Patrik Eliáš and Petr Sýkora, he led the team to the 2000 Stanley Cup championship, scoring the Cup-winning goal at 8:20 of double overtime in Game 6 against the Dallas Stars.

On March 19, 2002, Arnott was traded to the Dallas Stars with Randy McKay in exchange for Joe Nieuwendyk and Jamie Langenbrunner. In 2005–06, Arnott had a career-high 76 points for Dallas and scored 32 goals, the most since his rookie season, in which he had 33. He also set a career-high of 44 assists. In the off-season, he signed a five-year, $22.5 million contract as an unrestricted free agent with the Nashville Predators. He was named the Predators&#x27; fourth captain in the franchise&#x27;s history on September 12, 2007.

On June 19, 2010, Arnott was traded back to his Stanley Cup-winning team, the New Jersey Devils, in exchange for forward Matt Halischuk and a second-round pick in 2011. This was the first-ever trade between the Devils and the Predators. With the Devils, Arnott played alongside captain Jamie Langenbrunner, his original counterpart in his trade to the Stars in 2002.

On February 28, 2011, Arnott was again traded away from the New Jersey Devils, this time to the Washington Capitals, in exchange for Dave Steckel and a second-round pick in 2012.

On March 9, 2011, Arnott recorded his 900th career point against the team that drafted him, the Edmonton Oilers, in a 5–0 shutout victory. On April 2, 2011, he scored his 400th career goal in a 5–4 overtime victory against the Buffalo Sabres. On July 6, 2011, Arnott signed a free-agent contract with the St. Louis Blues.

After scoring 17 goals with 17 assists in 72 games during the 2011–12 season, the Blues opted not to re-sign Arnott. On January 26, 2013, he then signed a one-year deal with the New York Rangers worth approximately $1.6–$1.7 million. The deal, however, was not finalized when Arnott failed his physical and was not cleared to play by Rangers&#x27; doctors.

On November 5, 2013, Arnott announced his retirement from the NHL after 18 seasons in the NHL. In October 2014, it was announced that Arnott was hired as a part-time scout for the St. Louis Blues.

<doc id="425745" wikidata="Q4732456" url="?curid=425745" title="Alliance of Mennonite Evangelical Congregations">
<text>The Alliance of Mennonite Evangelical Congregations (AMEC) is an association of conservative evangelical Mennonite churches. The organization was officially formed in 2002 over concerns relating to the merger of the &quot;Mennonite Church&quot; and the &quot;General Conference Mennonite Church&quot;.

As a denomination, AMEC positions itself a voluntary association of congregations which maintain a common two-fold commitment &quot;both to the doctrinal foundation of evangelical orthodoxy and to the worthy tenets of historic biblical Anabaptism.&quot;
==Background==
The founding of the AMEC was the culmination of a movement to renew the 16th century Anabaptist emphasis on evangelism, coupled with concerns over doctrinal compromise and the upcoming merger of the &quot;Mennonite Church&quot; and the General Conference Mennonite Church. A consultation of evangelical Mennonite leaders was held at Smoketown, Pennsylvania, in July 1979. Out of this meeting came a declaration called the &quot;Smoketown Statement&quot;. It called for &quot;a reaffirmation of the authority of Scripture, a reexamination of priorities with emphasis on the saving power of the Gospel, and a clear call for renewed emphasis on evangelism.&quot; This was followed by another consultation held in Berne, Indiana, in March 1981. In 1992 this evangelical group organized the Evangelical Anabaptist Fellowship, and began publishing an &quot;EAF Newsletter&quot;. 

As the merger of the &quot;Mennonite Church&quot; and the &quot;General Conference Mennonite Church&quot; developed, they jointly adopted a new Confession of Faith as the basis of the merger. Members of the EAF believed that portions of the confession were left deliberately ambiguous, especially concerning the infallibility of the Scriptures. Other controversial issues included whether the new confession was merely a guideline or a definitive statement to which leadership would be expected to adhere in guiding the new denomination, and whether certain behaviors were to be prohibited to those who are members of the church. Some evangelical Mennonites felt that discussion of doctrinal issues was downplayed in order to promote unity and merger.

A meeting representing 24 churches from four states was convened on February 12, 2000, at Smoketown, Pennsylvania. Representatives concluded that &quot;in light of the formation of the new Mennonite Church USA and its departure from Biblical orthodoxy, we believe God is calling us to form a new affiliation of evangelical Anabaptist congregations.&quot; The EAF Board of Directors appointed a committee to make recommendations on how to proceed. Early in 2000, &quot;Association of Evangelical Mennonite Congregations&quot; was adopted as the tentative name of the organization, and the move toward organization was affirmed. On September 30, 2000, at a meeting in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, the first congregation committed to affiliate with the proposed organization. Soon after this, seven other congregations also committed to affiliate with the association. On June 19, 2002, bylaws were drafted. They were adopted on September 28, 2002. The name was changed to Alliance of Mennonite Evangelical Congregations.

==Status==
Membership in this new body, according to the bylaws, is open to any congregation that &quot;endorses the &quot;Purposes and Principles&quot;&quot;, and &quot;affirms the Statement of Doctrine&quot;. Individuals whose local congregation is not affiliated with the AMEC can apply for &quot;Associate Membership&quot; under the same conditions.

At the end of 2003, 16 congregations in Pennsylvania and New York were part of the &quot;Alliance of Mennonite Evangelical Congregations&quot;, representing possibly 2000 individual believers. Some of the congregations are dually aligned with the AMEC and the Mennonite Church USA. In the fall of 2003, they launched a quarterly publication, &quot;InterLink&quot;, which is available on their website or by mail. Currently offices are in Paradise, Pennsylvania. The Alliance conference and general assembly is held biennially. The body is committed to providing fellowship for evangelical Mennonites throughout North America.

As of 2016, 28 Congregations were affiliated with AMEC. Most were in Pennsylvania, but Oklahoma, New York, and Delaware were also represented. The Mennonite World Conference counted 2889 baptized members in 28 congregations belonging to the AMEC in their 2015 census.

==Faith and practice==
Beliefs include: the Bible as the inspired infallible word of God; the eternal existence of God in three persons; the virgin birth, sinless life, miracles, vicarious atonement, bodily resurrection, ascension, present intercession, and personal return of Jesus; mankind&#x27;s fall and the need of salvation; the sanctity of human life; marriage between one man and one woman; the doctrine of non-resistance; and the resurrection of all people to either eternal happiness or eternal separation from God. While anointing with oil, prayer for the sick, feet washing, and the devotional head covering are affirmed by most churches, the AMEC recognizes two ordinances — believers baptism and the Lord&#x27;s supper — as distinct from these other practices.

Local congregations are independent and autonomous, but the AMEC believes this does not &quot;…imply autonomy from the Authority of Scripture and its clear teachings…&quot;.

<text>The Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church is an office of the papal household that administers the property and revenues of the Holy See. Formerly, his responsibilities included the fiscal administration of the Patrimony of Saint Peter. As regulated in the apostolic constitution &quot;Pastor bonus&quot; of 1988, the Camerlengo is always a cardinal, though this was not the case prior to the 15th century. His heraldic arms are ornamented with two keysone gold, one silverin saltire, surmounted by an ombrellino, a canopy or umbrella of alternating red and yellow stripes. These also form part of the coat of arms of the Holy See during a papal interregnum (&quot;sede vacante&quot;). The Camerlengo has been Kevin Farrell since his appointment by Pope Francis on 14 February 2019. The Vice Camerlengo has been Archbishop Ilson de Jesus Montanari since 1 May 2020.

Until the 11th century, the Archdeacon of the Roman Church was responsible for the administration of the property of the Church (i.e., the Diocese of Rome), but the office&#x27;s numerous ancient privileges and rights had come to make it a frequent hindrance to independent action on the part of the Pope; as a result, when the last Archdeacon Hildebrand was elected to the Papacy as Gregory VII in 1073, he suppressed the Archdiaconate and the prelate entrusted with the supervision of the Apostolic Camera (), i.e., the possessions of the Holy See, became known as the &quot;Camerarius&quot; (&quot;Chamberlain&quot;). The Camerarius was for centuries a central figure in the Papal court. The name Camerlengo was adopted later, likely after the fashion of Valois-Anjou court.

It was the obligation of the Camerarius to formally establish the death of the Pope. Gradually, this evolved in the theory that the Camerarius, as the Chief of the Curia, should conduct normal business even after the death of the Pope, and also conduct the burial and the preparation for the new election. This process was evident with Camerarius Boso Breakspeare. During the long sede vacante of 1268 to 1271, the importance of the Camerarius was so clear that the Cardinals were ready to elect a new one if he died.

Prior to the 18th century, the Camerlengo enjoyed an income of 10,000 to 12,000 scudi a year out of the Apostolic Camera. He had jurisdiction over all suits involving the Apostolic Camera, and could judge separately or in association with the Clerics of the Apostolic Camera; he was not impeded by Consistory. He has appellate jurisdiction over suits decided by the Masters of the Roads. In a narration of the 18th century, the Camerlengo is the chief officer in the Apostolic Camera, the Financial Council of the Pope. In his office are the Governor of Rome (who is Vice-Chancellor), The Treasurer, the Auditor, the President, the Advocate General, the Fiscal Procurator, the Commissary, and twelve Clerks of the Chamber (one with the special title of Prefect of the Grain Supply, another Prefect of Provisions, another Prefect of Prisons, and another Prefect of Roads). Each Clerk of the Chamber received around 8,000 scudi a year, representing 10% of the business that passes through his office.

The powers and functions of the Camerlengo were diminished considerably in the 19th century, first by the reorganisation of the papal government after the election of Pope Pius VII in 1800, then by the reorganization of the papal government after the return of Pope Pius IX from exile in 1850, and then by the loss of the Papal States in 1860 and the City of Rome in 1870. The chief beneficiary of these changes was the Cardinal Secretary of State. Since early in the 20th century, the offices of Secretary of State and Camerlengo were held concurrently by Pietro Gasparri (1916–1930), Eugenio Pacelli (1935–1939), Jean-Marie Villot (1970–1979), and by Tarcisio Bertone (2007–2013). Since then Pope Francis has appointed as Camerlengo prelates who have not been Secretary of State: Jean-Louis Tauran (2014–2018) and Kevin Joseph Farrell (2019–present).

== Responsibilities ==
The Camerlengo is responsible for the formal determination of the death of the reigning Pope; the traditional procedure – abandoned centuries ago – was to call his baptismal name (e.g., &quot;&lt;Nomen&gt;, dormisne?&quot; meaning &quot;&lt;Name&gt;, are you sleeping?&quot;). After the Pope is declared dead, the Camerlengo takes possession of the Ring of the Fisherman and cuts it with shears in the presence of the cardinals. This act symbolizes the end of the late Pope&#x27;s authority and prevents its use in forging documents. The Camerlengo then notifies the appropriate officers of the Roman Curia and the Dean of the College of Cardinals. He participates in the preparations for the conclave and the Pope&#x27;s funeral.

In the past the Camerlengo took possession of the Pope&#x27;s last will and took responsibility for revealing its contents. Now the last will of the Pope is given to the College of Cardinals and its content is revealed during the first meeting of the College of Cardinals. The only responsibility still in the Camerlengo&#x27;s hands is to safekeep the last will of the Pope until the College of Cardinals takes possession of it.

Until a successor Pope can be elected, the Camerlengo serves as Vatican City&#x27;s Acting Sovereign. He is no longer, however, responsible for the government of the Catholic Church when the papacy is vacant; that task was placed in the hands of the College of Cardinals by &quot;Universi Dominici gregis&quot; (1996). His power is extremely limited, being merely enough to allow Church institutions to continue to operate and perform some basic functions without making any definitive decisions or appointments that are normally reserved to other powers delegated by the Pope. Unlike the rest of the Roman Curia, the Camerlengo retains his office during the &quot;sede vacante&quot; period and functions as the executive director of operations for the Vatican City and the Holy See, answerable to the College of Cardinals. This is primarily to carry out the College&#x27;s decisions with regard to the funeral of the late Pope and the events leading up to the conclave. The only other people who keep their offices during this time are the Major Penitentiary, the Archpriest of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, the Papal Almoner, and the Vicars General for Rome and for the Vatican City State.

Two Camerlengos have been elected Pope: Gioacchino Pecci (Pope Leo XIII) in 1878 and Eugenio Pacelli (Pope Pius XII) in 1939. Two others, Cencio Savelli (elected Pope Honorius III in 1216) and Rinaldo Conti di Segni (elected Pope Alexander IV in 1254) were not Camerlengo at the time of their election to the papacy, Cencio having served from 1188 until 1198 and Rinaldo from 1227 until 1231.

== In popular culture ==
* Dan Brown&#x27;s novel &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; and its film adaptation features a Camerlengo as a principal character. In the novel it is Carlo Ventresca, an Italian priest who is later revealed to be the son of the Pope conceived through artificial insemination. In the wake of the Pope&#x27;s death the camerlengo is serving an &quot;interrex&quot; function, fulfulling nominal papal duties until the Conclave has made its decision. In the film adaptation, the character is changed to the Northern Irish Patrick McKenna (played by Ewan McGregor), who is not a cardinal but the former papal chaplain to Pope Pius XVI. At the end of the film, the newly elected Pope Luke I selects the German Cardinal Strauss (played by Armin Mueller-Stahl), the former Great Elector of the College of Cardinals, to succeed McKenna as Camerlengo.
* The HBO series &quot;The Young Pope&quot; and its sequel series &quot;The New Pope&quot; features Camerlengo Angelo Voiello (played by Silvio Orlando) as a supporting character. Voiello also serves as Cardinal Secretary of State, and remains at his post through the papacies of Pius XIII (Jude Law), Francis II (Marcello Romolo) and John Paul III (John Malkovich) until Voiello becomes pope himself.

<doc id="425749" wikidata="Q7888075" url="?curid=425749" title="United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1980">
<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1980 with the song &quot;Love Enough for Two&quot;, written by Stephanie de Sykes and Stuart Slater, and performed by the group Prima Donna. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final.

==Before Eurovision==
===&quot;A Song for Europe 1980&quot;===
&quot;A Song for Europe 1980&quot; was held on 26 March 1980 (the same day as that year&#x27;s budget), at the BBC Television Theatre in London and was hosted by a dinner-suited Terry Wogan. The BBC Concert Orchestra under the direction of John Coleman as conductor accompanied all the songs, but all the music was pre-recorded. The theme music was &quot;Te deum&quot; the Eurovision theme. 12 songs were chosen by the Music Publisher&#x27;s Association.

Following his second place in the 1979 contest, songwriter Richard Gillinson was asked to submit a song to replace the disqualified entry &quot;Tell Me&quot; by The New Seekers, which was eliminated two weeks before the final after the group began promoting the track before the contest. Gillinson&#x27;s song &quot;Surrender&quot; was performed by the same artist who presented his 1979 song, Kim Clark. The lead vocal of &quot;Tell Me&quot; was taken by New Seeker Nicola Kerr, who had been one of the &#x27;Plus Two&#x27; who had finished 3rd for .

The twelve songs were voted on by 14 regional juries, who awarded 1-12 points to each song. Each of the 11 jurors awarded 1-5 points to each song, the total scores being added up, with the song earning the most points being awarded 12 points, the second placed song earned 11, the third 10 and so on, down to 1 point for the song with the fewest votes.

The jury spokesperson could be seen on screen awarding the votes, sometimes with the jury members in vision. These were broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s 14 regional news studios.

Owing to a tie break and with the live show quickly running out of time, a clearly flustered Terry Wogan, unsure of what to do in this unprecedented circumstance, returned to the 14 juries who were hastily asked to pick their favourite between songs two and five. Some juries ignored their previous voting and switched allegiance to Prima Donna who won by eight votes to six.

<doc id="425750" wikidata="Q48945" url="?curid=425750" title="Northampton Town F.C.">
<text>Northampton Town Football Club is a professional association football club based in the town of Northampton, England. The team competes in League One, the third level of the English football league system.

Founded in 1897, the club competed in the Midland League for two seasons, before joining the Southern League in 1901. They were crowned Southern League champions in 1908–09, allowing them to contest the 1909 FA Charity Shield. Admitted into the Football League in 1920, they spent the next 38 years in the Third Division South. Under Dave Bowen, the club achieved three promotions from the Fourth Division to the First Division within five years. However, Northampton only survived for one season in the top tier of English football after relegation in 1966. Northampton then experienced two further relegations in three years to return to the Fourth Division by 1969 – this set a record in English football of moving from the fourth tier to the first tier and back in only nine years. After six seasons of stability in the fourth tier, the club won promotion before returning to the Fourth Division after another relegation in 1977. Northampton won further promotions to the third tier in 1987 and 1997.

Relegated in 1999, they won immediate promotion after securing an automatic promotion place the following season. However they were once more relegated after three seasons of struggle in the third tier, before securing promotion out of League Two in 2005–06 after two unsuccessful play-off campaigns. Relegated at the end of their third season in League One, they won the League Two title in 2015–16, but only lasted two seasons in League One before again being relegated. In 2020, they gained promotion to League One, but were relegated to League Two once again after a single season in the third tier. They won promotion back to League One in 2023.

Northampton are nicknamed the &quot;Cobblers&quot;, a reference to the town&#x27;s historical shoe-making industry, and the team traditionally plays in claret and white kits. The Cobblers played at the County Ground from 1897 until 1994, when they moved to Sixfields Stadium, which has a capacity of 7,798. Northampton&#x27;s predominant rivals have been Peterborough United in the Nene derby.

== History ==
=== Formation and early history ===
The club was founded on 6 March 1897 by a group of local school teachers who, together with a local solicitor A.J &quot;Pat&quot; Darnell at The Princess Royal Inn, Wellingborough Road, formed the town&#x27;s first professional football club. Initially, their chosen name was Northampton Football Club, but after objections from the town&#x27;s rugby club, the club was called Northampton Town Football Club. They joined the Northants League and spent two seasons there, winning the championship the second season. They then spent two seasons in the Midland League, before joining the Southern League in 1901–02. Led by player-manager Herbert Chapman the club were champions of the Southern League in 1908–09 and played against Newcastle United in the Charity Shield match, losing 2–0 at The Oval.

=== Inter-war period ===
In 1919–20, the first season after the war, Town conceded a club record 103 goals. Nonetheless, the club was allowed to join the Football League for the following season, in Division Three (South). 1922–23 saw the club become a public company and 8,000 shares were released at £1. The season produced a record crowd of 18,123 against Plymouth on Boxing Day and gate receipts for the first time exceeded £1,000. 1923–24 started with the club raising £5,000 to build a stand with a players&#x27; tunnel underneath and also improved terracing in the Hotel End. The following season saw the formation of the supporters&#x27; club. In 1925 the club&#x27;s first foreign transfer took place as William Shaw was signed from Barcelona. A new ground record was set for the F.A. Cup third-round replay with Sunderland, 21,148 turned up to see the Cobblers lose 3–0. However, disaster occurred at the County Ground during December 1929, when a fire destroyed three stands, with damage valued at around £5,000. Only one stand was saved although this was charred. The source of the fire was thought to be in the away dressing room; the Cobblers had earlier entertained AFC Bournemouth reserves. By August 1930, the stands were rebuilt.

In 1932–33, the club created history when brothers Fred and Albert Dawes both scored in an 8–0 win over Newport County. The latter finished the season scoring 32 league goals and even scored four in a 4–0 win over the Netherlands national football team while the club was on tour. In 1933–34, the F.A. Cup fifth round was reached for the first time courtesy of a fourth round win away to Huddersfield Town who, at the time were top of Division One. The Cobblers lost to Preston North End 4–0 at Deepdale, setting a new ground record of 40,180. In the three seasons prior to the breakout of World War II, the Cobblers finished seventh, ninth and 17th respectively in Division Three (South). In the final match prior to the war, they travelled to Dean Court and lost 10–0, the club&#x27;s record league defeat. During the war the Cobblers had the record for the first transfer fee received during the hostilities when Bobby King was sold to Wolverhampton Wanderers for a substantial four-figure fee.

=== Rise and fall ===
Northampton were promoted three times in the five years 1960 to 1965. Starting the 1960–61 season in the Fourth Division, they reached the First Division in 1965–66, their only season ever in the top division of English football. They were then relegated back to the Fourth Division over the next five years, playing in the bottom tier again in 1969–70. During their top-flight season they earned a double against Aston Villa and victories at home over clubs including Leeds, Newcastle, West Ham, and Blackburn, the latter being the only team Northampton would finish above in the table.

Since their relegation from the Second Division in 1966–67, Northampton have played every season in either the third or fourth tier of English football.

=== 1970s and 80s ===
In 1970, they lost 8–2 to Manchester United in the FA Cup fifth round. Six of the goals conceded were scored by George Best, who received the match ball (signed by Northampton players) as a reward for his performance. For the first time since becoming a league side the club had to apply for re-election in 1971, they finished the most favoured club with 49 votes. In the 1974–75 season, future England International Phil Neal was sold, after 200 games in all competitions for the &quot;Cobblers&quot;, Liverpool bought Neal for a then club record of £65,000, whilst playing in the same side of another future England International, John Gregory. Finally during the 1975–76 season, the club finished second in Division Four and were promoted behind champions Lincoln City. They did this without losing a home game and having every regular player score during the season, including the goalkeeper, Alan Starling, who netted from a penalty in the penultimate home game against Hartlepool. In 1976–77, the club were relegated back to Division Four. The season started with ex-Manchester United assistant manager, Paddy Crerand in charge; however, he resigned in the new year. No new manager was appointed and instead a committee was formed consisting of the chairman, the coach and three senior players. Prior to the start of the 1979–80 season, George Reilly was sold to Cambridge United for a then-club record of £165,000 (he had been the club&#x27;s top scorer for the previous two seasons).

New floodlights were installed in time for the 1980–81 season, but they failed during the first match against Southend United and the game had to be abandoned. The club struggled in the bottom half of the Fourth Division for the first half of the decade, but 16-year-old Aidy Mann became the club&#x27;s youngest player in May 1984. In 1984–85, the lowest ever league attendance was recorded at the County Ground where only 942 people turn up to watch the &quot;Cobblers&quot; lose 2–0 at home to Chester City; this was also Northampton&#x27;s only ever league attendance below 1,000. In the same year, the club managed what seemed like a major coup when they appointed as manager Tony Barton, who had won the European Cup with Aston Villa two years previously. Barton&#x27;s only season in charge proved severely disappointing however, as the club were never outside the bottom two, and health problems forced Barton&#x27;s resignation near the end of that season. Success was achieved under Barton&#x27;s replacement, Graham Carr, who brought in several players from the non-league in addition to a number of quality league players to finish eighth in his first season in charge. The 1986–87 season saw Northampton win the Fourth Division championship, gaining a club record total of 99 points and scoring 103 goals, 29 of them from Richard Hill, who was transferred in the summer to Watford for a club record fee of £265,000. The club adjusted to life in Division Three quickly and just missed out on a play-off place despite finishing sixth. Important players such as Trevor Morley and Eddie McGoldrick were sold and the team fell back down to Division Four in the 1989–90 season.

=== Early 1990s ===
The 1990s began badly, with the club relegated to the Fourth Division at the end of the 1989–90 season. The following season began well as the club looked on course to return to the Third Division at the first attempt. They were top of the table in February, but fell away and finished mid-table. Things then got even worse and the club went into administration in April 1992, with debts of around £1.6 million. Ten players were sacked and youth players were drafted in to make up the numbers; results did not improve. These events sparked the formation of the Northampton Town Supporters&#x27; trust, which has a shareholding in the club and a representative on the board of directors. This was the first such instance of a supporters&#x27; trust taking over a football club.

The club needed to win the final game of the 1992–93 season to avoid being relegated to the Conference. Over 2,500 made the trip to Shrewsbury Town and saw the &quot;Cobblers&quot; win 3–2, despite being 2–0 down at half-time. The 1993–94 season got worse for the &quot;Cobblers&quot; as they finished bottom of the Football League for the only time in the club&#x27;s history. Relegation was only avoided due to the Conference champions, Kidderminster Harriers, not meeting the necessary ground criteria. The club eventually began its move to Sixfields.

=== The Sixfields era ===
The club moved to new ground, Sixfields Stadium, in October 1994. The change of ground did not change the club&#x27;s fortunes and they finished 17th, with Ian Atkins taking over as manager from John Barnwell halfway through the 1994–95 season. After two more seasons, in the club&#x27;s centenary season 1996–97, Atkins lead the &quot;Cobblers&quot; to Wembley for the first time in 100 years, where they beat Swansea City 1–0 in the Third Division play-off final, John Frain scoring the winning goal from a twice-taken free kick deep into injury time. The following season Northampton made the Second Division play-off final, but lost 1–0 to Grimsby Town in front of a then-record 62,998 crowd, with the Northampton support greater than 40,000 fans also a then-record for the most supporters taken to Wembley by one team. Northampton were not able to progress from the previous year&#x27;s success because of long-term injuries to 16 of their players during the 1998–99 season. The team was relegated to Division Three, despite being unbeaten in the last nine games of the season. However, there were some promising results such as a 2–1 aggregate win over West Ham United in the League Cup. The 1999–2000 season saw the club bounce back to Division Two, finishing in the third automatic promotion spot. Ian Atkins left the club in October following a poor start to the season; his assistant, Kevin Wilson and coach Kevan Broadhurst took joint charge for the rest of the month. Former Chelsea player Wilson was appointed manager at the start of November, going on to win two manager of the month awards.

The following season started promisingly, with players such as Marco Gabbiadini and Jamie Forrester pushing the &quot;Cobblers&quot; towards a play-off place before the club eventually finished in 18th place due to a large number of injuries in the second half of the season. Kevin Wilson was sacked in November 2001 to make way for his assistant Kevan Broadhurst, who steered the &quot;Cobblers&quot; from relegation to a remarkable survival with a game to spare after losing only one home game from mid-January. The next season was the worst since the early 1990s, both financially and on the pitch. Early on they were forced into a &#x27;Save our Season&#x27; campaign to keep afloat until the end of the year. It was required after the collapse of ITV Digital and much-publicised takeover attempts by John Fashanu and Giovanni Di Stefano had failed and left the club with huge debts. They were taken over by a consortium run by Andrew Ellis, who sacked Broadhurst in January 2003, when Northampton were struggling at the foot of the division. He was briefly replaced by former England player Terry Fenwick who was sacked after a winless spell of seven games. This was, at the time, the eighth-shortest managerial reign in English football history. Martin Wilkinson, the new manager lasted little longer, being dismissed in October 2003 in favour of former Scotland and Tottenham Hotspur defender Colin Calderwood. Calderwood led Northampton to the play-offs in his first season, where they were knocked out in the semi-finals by Mansfield Town after a penalty shoot-out. In the 2004–05 season, Northampton finished seventh, again in the play-offs, where they were defeated by Southend United. Following this, the manager made substantial changes to the squad, bringing in experienced players such as Ian Taylor and Eoin Jess, and they enjoyed a successful 2005–06 league season. On 29 April, the &quot;Cobblers&quot; clinched promotion to Football League One, with a 1–0 win at home to Chester City. On 30 May 2006, Northampton announced that Calderwood was leaving to join Nottingham Forest as their new manager, and he was replaced by John Gorman on 5 June. On 20 December, Gorman resigned due to &quot;personal issues&quot; with the side 18th in the table, with Ian Sampson and Jim Barron briefly taking care of first team affairs. He was replaced by former Southampton boss Stuart Gray on 2 January 2007. &quot;The Cobblers&quot; were relegated from League One on the final day of the 2008–09 season, after suffering a 3–0 defeat away at Leeds United and other results that went against them.

Northampton caused an upset in the third round of the 2010–11 Football League Cup, knocking out Liverpool at Anfield. The game was drawn 2–2 after extra time, as the &quot;Cobblers&quot; beat the team 69 places above them 4–2 on penalties, the winning penalty being scored by Abdul Osman at the &#x27;Kop End&#x27;. Ian Sampson was sacked as manager on 2 March 2011 after a poor run of form saw the &quot;Cobblers&quot; fail to win in eight games and sit in a disappointing 16th position in League Two. Sampson&#x27;s last game in charge was a 2–3 defeat against Burton Albion, the manner of this defeat ultimately costing him his job. Sampson&#x27;s sacking brought to an end a 17-year association with Northampton, and his commitment to the club has guaranteed his status as a legend in fans&#x27; hearts.

David Cardoza moved quickly and Gary Johnson was unveiled as the new manager on 4 March 2011. However, things didn&#x27;t go well under Johnson: the club slid further down the table in League Two and only just avoided relegation at the end of the 2010–11 season. The beginning of the 2011–12 season saw no improvement for the &quot;Cobblers&quot; and Johnson left the club on 14 November 2011 by mutual consent. In November 2011, Northampton appointed ex-Watford manager Aidy Boothroyd as their new manager. After drafting in players such as Ben Harding, Luke Guttridge and Clarke Carlisle, Boothroyd managed to keep Northampton in the league and over the summer set about transforming the club into a club with promotion ambitions. On 18 May 2013, Northampton reached the League Two play-off final, losing 3–0 to Bradford City at Wembley Stadium.

After a poor start to the 2013–14 League Two season, Northampton found themselves at the foot of the table, and as of 21 December, they had only won four games. Boothroyd was subsequently sacked. From the start of the 2013–14 season, Northampton shared their Sixfields Stadium with Coventry City with the West Midlands club going through a protracted dispute with the owners of their previous home, the Ricoh Arena in Coventry. On 27 January 2014, David Cardoza appointed former Oxford United manager Chris Wilder as the new manager of the club on a three-and-a-half-year deal.

In October 2015, HM Revenue and Customs issued the club with a winding-up petition over unpaid taxes. &quot;(See Sixfields Stadium)&quot; In February 2016, Northampton Town broke their club record of eight successive wins by beating Wycombe Wanderers 1–0, extending the winning run to nine. The 2015–16 season was successful and resulted in promotion to League One on 9 April. A draw at Exeter combined with Oxford United&#x27;s defeat at home to Luton Town meant that they clinched the League Two championship a week later on 16 April.

&quot;The Cobblers&quot; went on to play their first season in the third tier of English football since 2009. In the 2016–17 season, after a 5–0 defeat to Bristol Rovers, Rob Page was sacked and replaced with Justin Edinburgh. Northampton finished 16th, meaning that they would continue to play third-tier football. They made it to the third round of the EFL Cup, where they lost to Manchester United. On 26 June 2017 a 60% stake in Northampton Town was purchased by Chinese company 5uSport. The company indicated that they would invest in both the playing budget and stadium development. Although the investment was technically a takeover, Kelvin Thomas remained chairman and the two parties have acted in partnership since.

On 4 September 2017, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink was appointed as manager on a three-year deal, replacing Justin Edinburgh who had been sacked after four losses from the start of the season. His first game was against Doncaster Rovers five days later, a home tie which ended in a 1–0 victory for Northampton Town. He was sacked on 2 April 2018 after Northampton Town went nine games without a win and was replaced by Keith Curle. Curle had his contract extended in July 2020 for a further two years.

On 29 June 2020, the club were promoted to League One after beating Exeter City 4–0 in the play-off final, despite a delay in the season due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. This was Northampton&#x27;s fourth EFL play-off final and it ended in victory, 23 seasons after their only other Wembley win for promotion. They made it to Wembley following a second leg comeback against Cheltenham Town, after the first leg at Sixfields Stadium where they had trailed 2–0 and faced an uphill battle to progress to the play-off final. However, in the second leg, the &quot;Cobblers&quot; performed the turnaround by winning 3–0 away from home. However, Northampton were relegated back to League Two in their first season after finishing 22nd in the 2020–21 season.

In the 2021–22 season Northampton finished fourth, narrowly missing out on automatic promotion on the final day to Bristol Rovers. Although Northampton started the final day in the automatic positions and managed to win their away match to Barrow 3–1, Bristol Rovers managed to beat Scunthorpe United 7–0. This meant Rovers would gain the final automatic promotion place based on goals scored across the season. In the play-off semi-finals, the &quot;Cobblers&quot; were subsequently defeated by Mansfield Town 3–1 on aggregate. In the following season, they defeated Tranmere Rovers on the final day of the season to seal automatic promotion to League One.

==Stadiums==

===County Ground===
Northampton moved to the county ground in 1897, sharing it with Northamptonshire County Cricket Club from 1905. The main stand was situated alongside Abington Avenue and was a covered stand with seating to the rear and terracing to the front. The stand survived until 1985, but following the Bradford City stadium fire, it was deemed unsafe and demolished, leaving only the terracing. This was then replaced by a small temporary stand nicknamed the &#x27; &quot;Meccano Stand&quot; &#x27; by fans. The other two stands were at the ends with the Spion Kop, which only reached the goalposts, usually used for away supporters and the Hotel End for the home supporters. In 1965–66, the only time that Northampton Town were in the top flight of English football, the county ground saw its highest attendance 24,523 against Fulham on 23 April 1966. The ground also saw Northampton&#x27;s lowest ever attendance in the Football League, a crowd of 942 for the 1984–85 match against Chester City. The last game to be played at the ground was a 1–0 defeat by Mansfield Town on Tuesday, 12 October 1994.

===Sixfields Stadium===

The club moved to Sixfields Stadium in 1994. It is a modern all-seater stadium with a capacity of 7,653 and award-winning disabled facilities. The stadium plan is simple with the west stand seating 4,000, opposite the smaller 1,000-capacity east stand known as the Alwyn Hargrave stand after the Ex-Borough Councillor who helped the stadium become reality. At either end are identical stands that are the same height as the east stand, the south stand usually for away supporters. (Against Chester City on 29 April 2006, the stand was split and supporters segregated to allow the maximum number of home supporters to witness the club&#x27;s promotion to League One.) The north Stand is known as the Sheinman Opticians Stand, due to a naming rights partnership with local Opticians, Sheinman Opticians.

The stadium was renamed the PTS Academy Stadium in June 2018 after the club agreed a naming rights partnership with local training provider PTS Training Academy.
 The name of the stadium reverted to Sixfields Stadium in July 2021, following the liquidation of PTS Training Academy.

;Training ground
Since July 2016, Northampton have trained at Moulton College in Moulton, Northampton. Before this, they trained at the former athletics track, located at the back of the East Stand at Sixfields Stadium.

==Supporters and rivalries==
The club&#x27;s biggest traditional rivals are Peterborough United, a rivalry which has endured since the 1960s. Matches between the two clubs are known as the Nene derby, after the river which links Northampton and Peterborough. Other significant rivalries include Oxford United, Milton Keynes Dons, Coventry City, Cambridge United and Rushden &amp; Diamonds.

===Managerial history===

Below is a list of all permanent managers of Northampton Town since its foundation in 1897.

==Club records==
Northampton Town hold the record for the shortest time taken to be promoted from the bottom tier to the top tier and relegated back down to the bottom again, in the space of nine years.

Tommy Fowler holds the record for Northampton Town appearances, having played 552 first-team matches between 1946 and 1961. Centre half and former captain Ian Sampson comes second, with 449 games. The record for a goalkeeper is held by Peter Gleasure, with 412 appearances.

Jack English is the club&#x27;s top goalscorer with 143 goals in competitive matches between 1947 and 1959, having surpassed Teddy Bowen&#x27;s total of 120. Bowen&#x27;s record had stood since September 1931, when he overtook the total of 110 goals set by striker William Lockett in 1930.

The highest attendance at the County Ground of 24,523 was on 23 April 1966 in an important relegation battle in the First Division against Fulham. It is unlikely that this record will be broken unless redevelopment takes place at Sixfields. The record attendance at Sixfields is 7,798, for an EFL Cup match against Manchester United on 21 September 2016.

<doc id="425753" wikidata="Q1065985" url="?curid=425753" title="Late Ordovician mass extinction">
<text>The Late Ordovician mass extinction (LOME), sometimes known as the end-Ordovician mass extinction or the Ordovician-Silurian extinction, is the first of the &quot;big five&quot; major mass extinction events in Earth&#x27;s history, occurring roughly 445 million years ago (Ma). It is often considered to be the second-largest known extinction event just behind the end-Permian mass extinction, in terms of the percentage of genera that became extinct. Extinction was global during this interval, eliminating 49–60% of marine genera and nearly 85% of marine species. Under most tabulations, only the Permian-Triassic mass extinction exceeds the Late Ordovician mass extinction in biodiversity loss. The extinction event abruptly affected all major taxonomic groups and caused the disappearance of one third of all brachiopod and bryozoan families, as well as numerous groups of conodonts, trilobites, echinoderms, corals, bivalves, and graptolites. Despite its taxonomic severity, the Late Ordovician mass extinction did not produce major changes to ecosystem structures compared to other mass extinctions, nor did it lead to any particular morphological innovations. Diversity gradually recovered to pre-extinction levels over the first 5 million years of the Silurian period.

The Late Ordovician mass extinction is traditionally considered to occur in two distinct pulses. The first pulse (interval), known as LOMEI-1, began at the boundary between the Katian and Hirnantian stages of the Late Ordovician epoch. This extinction pulse is typically attributed to the Late Ordovician glaciation, which abruptly expanded over Gondwana at the beginning of the Hirnantian and shifted the Earth from a greenhouse to icehouse climate. Cooling and a falling sea level brought on by the glaciation led to habitat loss for many organisms along the continental shelves, especially endemic taxa with restricted temperature tolerance and latitudinal range. During this extinction pulse, there were also several marked changes in biologically responsive carbon and oxygen isotopes. Marine life partially rediversified during the cold period and a new cold-water ecosystem, the &quot;&quot;Hirnantia&quot; fauna&quot;, was established.

The second pulse (interval) of extinction, referred to as LOMEI-2, occurred in the later half of the Hirnantian as the glaciation abruptly receded and warm conditions returned. The second pulse was associated with intense worldwide anoxia (oxygen depletion) and euxinia (toxic sulfide production), which persisted into the subsequent Rhuddanian stage of the Silurian Period.

Some researchers have proposed the existence of a third distinct pulse of the mass extinction during the early Rhuddanian, evidenced by a negative carbon isotope excursion and a pulse of anoxia into shelf environments amidst already low background oxygen levels. Others, however, have argued that Rhuddanian anoxia was simply part of the second pulse, which according to this view was longer and more drawn out than most authors suggest.

== Impact on life ==

=== Ecological impacts ===
The Late Ordovician mass extinction followed the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE), one of the largest surges of increasing biodiversity in the geological and biological history of the Earth. At the time of the extinction, most complex multicellular organisms lived in the sea, and the only evidence of life on land are rare spores from small early land plants.

At the time of the extinction, around 100 marine families became extinct, covering about 49% of genera (a more reliable estimate than species). The brachiopods and bryozoans were strongly impacted, along with many of the trilobite, conodont and graptolite families. The extinction was divided into two major extinction pulses. The first pulse occurred at the base of the global &quot;Metabolograptus extraordinarius&quot; graptolite biozone, which marks the end of the Katian stage and the start of the Hirnantian stage. The second pulse of extinction occurred in the later part of the Hirnantian stage, coinciding with the &quot;Metabolograptus persculptus&quot; zone. Each extinction pulse affected different groups of animals and was followed by a rediversification event. Statistical analysis of marine losses at this time suggests that the decrease in diversity was mainly caused by a sharp increase in extinctions, rather than a decrease in speciation.

Following such a major loss of diversity, Silurian communities were initially less complex and broader niched. Nonetheless, in South China, warm-water benthic communities with complex trophic webs thrived immediately following LOME. Highly endemic faunas, which characterized the Late Ordovician, were replaced by faunas that were amongst the most cosmopolitan in the Phanerozoic, biogeographic patterns that persisted throughout most of the Silurian. LOME had few of the long-term ecological impacts associated with the Permian–Triassic and Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction events. Furthermore, biotic recovery from LOME proceeded at a much faster rate than it did after the Permian-Triassic extinction. Nevertheless, a large number of taxa disappeared from the Earth over a short time interval, eliminating and altering the relative diversity and abundance of certain groups. The Cambrian-type evolutionary fauna nearly died out, and was unable to rediversify after the extinction.

=== Biodiversity changes in marine invertebrates ===

==== Brachiopods ====
Brachiopod diversity and composition was strongly affected, with the Cambrian-type inarticulate brachiopods (linguliforms and craniiforms) never recovering their pre-extinction diversity. Articulate (rhynchonelliform) brachiopods, part of the Paleozoic evolutionary fauna, were more variable in their response to the extinction. Some early rhynchonelliform groups, such as the Orthida and Strophomenida, declined significantly. Others, including the Pentamerida, Athyridida, Spiriferida, and Atrypida, were less affected and took the opportunity to diversify after the extinction. Additionally, brachiopods with higher abundance were more likely to survive.

The extinction pulse at the end of the Katian was selective in its effects, disproportionally affecting deep-water species and tropical endemics inhabiting epicontinental seas. The &quot;Foliomena&quot; fauna, an assemblage of thin-shelled species adapted for deep dysoxic (low oxygen) waters, went extinct completely in the first extinction pulse. The &quot;Foliomena&quot; fauna was formerly widespread and resistant to background extinction rates prior to the Hirnantian, so their unexpected extinction points towards the abrupt loss of their specific habitat. During the glaciation, a high-latitude brachiopod assemblage, the &quot;Hirnantia&quot; fauna, established itself along outer shelf environments in lower latitudes, probably in response to cooling. However, the &quot;Hirnantia&quot; fauna would meet its demise in the second extinction pulse, replaced by Silurian-style assemblages adapted for warmer waters.

The brachiopod survival intervals following the second pulse spanned the terminal Hirnantian to the middle Rhuddanian, after which the recovery interval began and lasted until the early Aeronian. Overall, the brachiopod recovery in the late Rhuddanian was rapid. Brachiopod survivors of the mass extinction tended to be endemic to one palaeoplate or even one locality in the survival interval in the earliest Silurian, though their ranges geographically expanded over the course of the biotic recovery. The region around what is today Oslo was a hotbed of atrypide rediversification. Brachiopod recovery consisted mainly of the reestablishment of cosmopolitan brachiopod taxa from the Late Ordovician. Progenitor taxa that arose following the mass extinction displayed numerous novel adaptations for resisting environmental stresses. Although some brachiopods did experience the Lilliput effect in response to the extinction, this phenomenon was not particularly widespread compared to other mass extinctions.

==== Trilobites ====
Trilobites were hit hard by both phases of the extinction, with about 70% of genera and 50% of families going extinct between the Katian and Silurian. The extinction disproportionately affected deep water species and groups with fully planktonic larvae or adults. The order Agnostida was completely wiped out, and the formerly diverse Asaphida survived with only a single genus, &quot;Raphiophorus&quot;. A cool-water trilobite assemblage, the &quot;Mucronaspis&quot; fauna, coincides with the &quot;Hirnantia&quot; brachiopod fauna in the timing of its expansion and demise. Trilobite faunas after the extinction were dominated by families that appeared in the Ordovician and survived LOME, such as Encrinuridae and Odontopleuridae.

==== Bryozoans ====
Over a third of bryozoan genera went extinct, but most families survived the extinction interval and the group as a whole recovered in the Silurian. The hardest-hit subgroups were the cryptostomes and trepostomes, which never recovered the full extent of their Ordovician diversity. Bryozoan extinctions started in coastal regions of Laurentia, before high extinction rates shifted to Baltica by the end of the Hirnantian. Bryozoan biodiversity loss appears to have been a prolonged process which partially preceded the Hirnantian extinction pulses. Extinction rates among Ordovician bryozoan genera were actually higher in the early and late Katian, and origination rates sharply dropped in the late Katian and Hirnantian.

==== Echinoderms ====
About 70% of crinoid genera died out. Early studies of crinoid biodiversity loss by Jack Sepkoski overestimated crinoid biodiversity losses during LOME. Most extinctions occurred in the first pulse. However, they rediversified quickly in tropical areas and reacquired their pre-extinction diversity not long into the Silurian. Many other echinoderms became very rare after the Ordovician, such as the cystoids, edrioasteroids, and other early crinoid-like groups.

==== Sponges ====
Stromatoporoid generic and familial taxonomic diversity was not significantly impacted by the mass extinction. A change in abundance is recorded, however; clathrodictyids increased in abundance relative to labechiids. Sponges thrived and dominated marine ecosystems in South China immediately after the extinction event, colonising depauperate, anoxic environments in the earliest Rhuddanian. Their pervasiveness in marine environments after the biotic crisis has been attributed to drastically decreased competition and an abundance of vacant niches left behind by organisms that perished in the catastrophe. Sponges may have assisted the recovery of other sessile suspension feeders: by helping stabilise sediment surfaces, they enabled bryozoans, brachiopods, and corals to recolonise the seafloor.

==Glaciation and cooling==

The first pulse of the Late Ordovician Extinction has typically been attributed to the Late Ordovician Glaciation, which is unusual among mass extinctions and has made LOME an outlier. Although there was a longer cooling trend in Middle and Lower Ordovician, the most severe and abrupt period of glaciation occurred in the Hirnantian stage, which was bracketed by both pulses of the extinction. The rapid continental glaciation was centered on Gondwana, which was located at the South Pole in the Late Ordovician. The Hirnantian glaciation is considered one of the most severe ice ages of the Paleozoic, which previously maintained the relatively warm climate conditions of a greenhouse earth.

The cause of the glaciation is heavily debated. The late Ordovician glaciation was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide (from 7,000 ppm to 4,400 ppm). Atmospheric and oceanic CO2 levels may have fluctuated with the growth and decay of Gondwanan glaciation. The appearance and development of terrestrial plants and microphytoplankton, which consumed atmospheric carbon dioxide, may have diminished the greenhouse effect and promoting the transition of the climatic system to the glacial mode. Heavy silicate weathering of the uplifting Appalachians and Caledonides occurred during the Late Ordovician, which sequestered CO2. In the Hirnantian stage the volcanism diminished, and the continued weathering caused a significant and rapid draw down of CO2 coincident with the rapid and short ice age. As Earth cooled and sea levels dropped, highly weatherable carbonate platforms became exposed above water, enkindling a positive feedback loop of inorganic carbon sequestration. A hypothetical large igneous province emplaced during the Katian whose existence is unproven has been speculated to have been the sink that absorbed carbon dioxide and precipitated Hirnantian cooling. Alternatively, volcanic activity may have caused the cooling by supplying sulphur aerosols to the atmosphere and generating severe volcanic winters that triggered a runaway ice-albedo positive feedback loop. In addition, volcanic fertilisation of the oceans with phosphorus may have increased populations of photosynthetic algae and enhanced biological sequestration of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Increased burial of organic carbon is another method of drawing down carbon dioxide from the air that may have played a role in the Late Ordovician. Other studies point to an asteroid strike and impact winter as the culprit for the glaciation. True polar wander and the associated rapid palaeogeographic changes have also been proposed as a cause. Other studies have even suggested that shading of the sun&#x27;s rays by a temporary planetary ring formed from the partial breakup of a large meteor in the atmosphere may have caused the glaciation, which would also link it to the Ordovician meteor event.

Two environmental changes associated with the glaciation were responsible for much of the Late Ordovician extinction. First, the cooling global climate was probably especially detrimental because the biota were adapted to an intense greenhouse, especially because most shallow sea habitats in the Ordovician were located in the tropics. The southward shift of the polar front severely contracted the available latitudinal range of warm-adapted organisms. Second, sea level decline, caused by sequestering of water in the ice cap, drained the vast epicontinental seaways and eliminated the habitat of many endemic communities. The dispersed positions of the continents, in contrast to their position during the much less extinction-inducing Pleistocene glaciations, made glacioeustatic marine regression especially hazardous to marine life. Falling sea levels may have acted as a positive feedback loop accelerating further cooling; as shallow seas receded, carbonate-shelf production declined and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels correspondingly decreased, fostering even more cooling.

Ice caps formed on the southern supercontinent Gondwana as it drifted over the South Pole. Correlating rock strata have been detected in Late Ordovician rock strata of North Africa and then-adjacent northeastern South America, which were south-polar locations at the time. Glaciation locks up water from the world-ocean and interglacials free it, causing sea levels repeatedly to drop and rise; the vast, shallow Ordovician seas withdrew, which eliminated many ecological niches, then returned, carrying diminished founder populations lacking many whole families of organisms. Then they withdrew again with the next pulse of glaciation, eliminating biological diversity at each change. In the North African strata, five pulses of glaciation from seismic sections are recorded. In the Yangtze Platform, a relict warm-water fauna continued to persist because South China blocked the transport of cold waters from Gondwanan waters at higher latitudes.

This incurred a shift in the location of bottom water formation, shifting from low latitudes, characteristic of greenhouse conditions, to high latitudes, characteristic of icehouse conditions, which was accompanied by increased deep-ocean currents and oxygenation of the bottom water. An opportunistic fauna briefly thrived there, before anoxic conditions returned. The breakdown in the oceanic circulation patterns brought up nutrients from the abyssal waters. Surviving species were those that coped with the changed conditions and filled the ecological niches left by the extinctions.

However, not all studies agree that cooling and glaciation caused LOMEI-1. One study suggests that the first pulse began not during the rapid Hirnantian ice cap expansion but in an interval of deglaciation following it.

== Anoxia and euxinia ==
Another heavily-discussed factor in the Late Ordovician mass extinction is anoxia, the absence of dissolved oxygen in seawater. Anoxia not only deprives most life forms of a vital component of respiration, it also encourages the formation of toxic metal ions and other compounds. One of the most common of these poisonous chemicals is hydrogen sulfide, a biological waste product and major component of the sulfur cycle. Oxygen depletion when combined with high levels of sulfide is called euxinia. Though less toxic, ferrous iron (Fe2+) is another substance which commonly forms in anoxic waters. Anoxia is the most common culprit for the second pulse of the Late Ordovician mass extinction and is connected to many other mass extinctions throughout geological time. It may have also had a role in the first pulse of the Late Ordovician mass extinction, though support for this hypothesis is inconclusive and contradicts other evidence for high oxygen levels in seawater during the glaciation.

=== Early Hirnantian anoxia ===

Some geologists have argued that anoxia played a role in the first extinction pulse, though this hypothesis is controversial. In the early Hirnantian, shallow-water sediments throughout the world experience a large positive excursion in the δ34S ratio of buried pyrite. This ratio indicates that shallow-water pyrite which formed at the beginning of the glaciation had a decreased proportion of 32S, a common lightweight isotope of sulfur. 32S in the seawater could hypothetically be used up by extensive deep-sea pyrite deposition. The Ordovician ocean also had very low levels of sulfate, a nutrient which would otherwise resupply 32S from the land. Pyrite forms most easily in anoxic and euxinic environments, while better oxygenation encourages the formation of gypsum instead. As a result, anoxia and euxinia would need to be common in the deep sea to produce enough pyrite to shift the δ34S ratio.

Thallium isotope ratios can also be used as indicators of anoxia. A major positive ε205Tl excursion in the late Katian, just before the Katian-Hirnantian boundary, likely reflects a global enlargement of oxygen minimum zones. During the late Katian, thallium isotopic perturbations indicating proliferation of anoxic waters notably preceded the appearance of other geochemical indicators of the expansion of anoxia.

A more direct proxy for anoxic conditions is FeHR/FeT. This ratio describes the comparative abundance of highly reactive iron compounds which are only stable without oxygen. Most geological sections corresponding to the beginning of the Hirnantian glaciation have FeHR/FeT below 0.38, indicating oxygenated waters. However, higher FeHR/FeT values are known from a few deep-water early Hirnantian sequences found in China and Nevada. Elevated FePy/FeHR values have also been found in association with LOMEI-1, including ones above 0.8 that are tell-tale indicators of euxinia.

Glaciation could conceivably trigger anoxic conditions, albeit indirectly. If continental shelves are exposed by falling sea levels, then organic surface runoff flows into deeper oceanic basins. The organic matter would have more time to leach out phosphate and other nutrients before being deposited on the seabed. Increased phosphate concentration in the seawater would lead to eutrophication and then anoxia. Deep-water anoxia and euxinia would impact deep-water benthic fauna, as expected for the first pulse of extinction. Chemical cycle disturbances would also steepen the chemocline, restricting the habitable zone of planktonic fauna which also go extinct in the first pulse. This scenario is congruent with both organic carbon isotope excursions and general extinction patterns observed in the first pulse.

However, data supporting deep-water anoxia during the glaciation contrasts with more extensive evidence for well-oxygenated waters. Black shales, which are indicative of an anoxic environment, become very rare in the early Hirnantian compared to surrounding time periods. Although early Hirnantian black shales can be found in a few isolated ocean basins (such as the Yangtze platform of China), from a worldwide perspective these correspond to local events. Some Chinese sections record an early Hirnantian increase in the abundance of Mo-98, a heavy isotope of molybdenum. This shift can correspond to a balance between minor local anoxia and well-oxygenated waters on a global scale. Other trace elements point towards increased deep-sea oxygenation at the start of the glaciation. Oceanic current modelling suggest that glaciation would have encouraged oxygenation in most areas, apart from the Paleo-Tethys ocean. Devastation of the Dicranograptidae-Diplograptidae-Orthograptidae (DDO) graptolite fauna, which was well adapted to anoxic conditions, further suggests that LOMEI-1 was associated with increased oxygenation of the water column and not the other way around.

Deep-sea anoxia is not the only explanation for the δ34S excursion of pyrite. Carbonate-associated sulfate maintains high 32S levels, indicating that seawater in general did not experience 32S depletion during the glaciation. Even if pyrite burial did increase at that time, its chemical effects would have been far too slow to explain the rapid excursion or extinction pulse. Instead, cooling may lower the metabolism of warm-water aerobic bacteria, reducing decomposition of organic matter. Fresh organic matter would eventually sink down and supply nutrients to sulfate-reducing microbes living in the seabed. Sulfate-reducing microbes prioritize 32S during anaerobic respiration, leaving behind heavier isotopes. A bloom of sulfate-reducing microbes can quickly account for the δ34S excursion in marine sediments without a corresponding decrease in oxygen.

A few studies have proposed that the first extinction pulse did not begin with the Hirnantian glaciation, but instead corresponds to an interglacial period or other warming event. Anoxia would be the most likely mechanism of extinction in a warming event, as evidenced by other extinctions involving warming. However, this view of the first extinction pulse is controversial and not widely accepted.

=== Late Hirnantian anoxia ===
The late Hirnantian experienced a dramatic increase in the abundance of black shales. Coinciding with the retreat of the Hirnantian glaciation, black shale expands out of isolated basins to become the dominant oceanic sediment at all latitudes and depths. The worldwide distribution of black shales in the late Hirnantian is indicative of a global anoxic event, which has been termed the Hirnantian ocean anoxic event (HOAE). Corresponding to widespread anoxia are δ34SCAS, δ98Mo, δ238U, and εNd(t) excursions found in many different regions. At least in European sections, late Hirnantian anoxic waters were originally ferruginous (dominated by ferrous iron) before gradually becoming more euxinic. In the Yangtze Sea, located on the western margins of the South China microcontinent, the second extinction pulse occurred alongside intense euxinia which spread out from the middle of the continental shelf. Mercury loading in South China during LOMEI-2 was likely related to euxinia. However, some evidence suggests that the top of the water column in the Ordovician oceans remained well oxygenated even as the seafloor became deoxygenated. On a global scale, euxinia was probably one or two orders of magnitude more prevalent than in the modern day. Global anoxia may have lasted more than 3 million years, persisting through the entire Rhuddanian stage of the Silurian period. This would make the Hirnantian-Rhuddanian anoxia one of the longest-lasting anoxic events in geologic time.

The cause of the Hirnantian-Rhuddanian anoxic event is uncertain. Like most global anoxic events, an increased supply of nutrients (such as nitrates and phosphates) would encourage algal or microbial blooms that deplete oxygen levels in the seawater. The most likely culprits are cyanobacteria, which can use nitrogen fixation to produce usable nitrogen compounds in the absence of nitrates. Nitrogen isotopes during the anoxic event record high rates of denitrification, a biological process which depletes nitrates. The Nitrogen-fixing ability of cyanobacteria would give them an edge over inflexible competitors like eukaryotic algae. At Anticosti Island, a uranium isotope excursion consistent with anoxia actually occurs prior to indicators of receding glaciation. This may suggest that the Hirnantian-Rhuddanian anoxic event (and its corresponding extinction) began during the glaciation, not after it. Cool temperatures can lead to upwelling, cycling nutrients into productive surface waters via air and ocean cycles. Upwelling could instead be encouraged by increasing oceanic stratification through an input of freshwater from melting glaciers. This would be more reasonable if the anoxic event coincided with the end of glaciation, as supported by most other studies. However, oceanic models argue that marine currents would recover too quickly for freshwater disruptions to have a meaningful effect on nutrient cycles. Retreating glaciers could expose more land to weathering, which would be a more sustained source of phosphates flowing into the ocean. There is also evidence implicating volcanism as a contributor to Late Hirnantian anoxia.

There were few clear patterns of extinction associated with the second extinction pulse. Every region and marine environment experienced the second extinction pulse to some extent. Many taxa which survived or diversified after the first pulse were finished off in the second pulse. These include the &quot;Hirnantia&quot; brachiopod fauna and &quot;Mucronaspis&quot; trilobite fauna, which previously thrived in the cold glacial period. Other taxa such as graptolites and warm-water reef denizens were less affected. Sediments from China and Baltica seemingly show a more gradual replacement of the &quot;Hirnantia&quot; fauna after glaciation. Although this suggests that the second extinction pulse may have been a minor event at best, other paleontologists maintain that an abrupt ecological turnover accompanied the end of glaciation. There may be a correlation between the relatively slow recovery after the second extinction pulse, and the prolonged nature of the anoxic event which accompanied it. On the other hand, the occurrence of euxinic pulses similar in magnitude to LOMEI-2 during the Katian without ensuing biological collapses has caused some researchers to question whether euxinia alone could have been LOMEI-2&#x27;s driver.

=== Early Rhuddanian anoxia ===
Deposition of black graptolite shales continued to be common into the earliest Rhuddanian, indicating that anoxia persisted well into the Llandovery. A sharp reduction in the average size of many organisms, likely attributable to the Lilliput effect, and the disappearance of many relict taxa from the Ordovician indicate a third extinction interval linked to an expansion of anoxic conditions into shallower shelf environments, particularly in Baltica. This sharp decline in dissolved oxygen concentrations was likely linked to a period of global warming documented by a negative carbon isotope excursion preserved in Baltican sediments.

== Other potential factors ==

===Metal poisoning===
Toxic metals on the ocean floor may have dissolved into the water when the oceans&#x27; oxygen was depleted. An increase in available nutrients in the oceans may have been a factor, and decreased ocean circulation caused by global cooling may also have been a factor. Hg/TOC values from the Peri-Baltic region indicate noticeable spikes in mercury concentrations during the lower late Katian, the Katian-Hirnantian boundary, and the late Hirnantian.

The toxic metals may have killed life forms in lower trophic levels of the food chain, causing a decline in population, and subsequently resulting in starvation for the dependent higher feeding life forms in the chain.

=== Gamma-ray burst ===
A minority hypothesis to explain the first burst has been proposed by Philip Ball, Adrian Lewis Melott, and Brian C. Thomas, suggesting that the initial extinctions could have been caused by a gamma-ray burst originating from a hypernova in a nearby arm of the Milky Way galaxy, within 6,000 light-years of Earth. A ten-second burst would have stripped the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere of half of its ozone almost immediately, exposing surface-dwelling organisms, including those responsible for planetary photosynthesis, to high levels of extreme ultraviolet radiation. Under this hypothesis, several groups of marine organisms with a planktonic lifestyle were more exposed to more UV radiation than groups that lived on the seabed. It is estimated that 20% to 60% of the total phytoplankton biomass on Earth would have been killed in such an event because the oceans were mostly oligotrophic and clear during the Late Ordovician. This is consistent with observations that planktonic organisms suffered severely during the first extinction pulse. In addition, species dwelling in shallow water were more likely to become extinct than species dwelling in deep water, also consistent with the hypothetical effects of a galactic gamma-ray burst.

A gamma-ray burst could also explain the rapid expansion of glaciers, since the high energy rays would cause ozone, a greenhouse gas, to dissociate and its dissociated oxygen atoms to then react with nitrogen to form nitrogen dioxide, a darkly-coloured aerosol which cools the planet. It would also cohere with the major δ13C isotopic excursion indicating increased sequestration of carbon-12 out of the atmosphere, which would have occurred as a result of the nitrogen dioxide reacting with hydroxyl and raining back down to Earth as nitric acid, precipitating large quantities of nitrates that would have enhanced wetland productivity and sequestration of carbon dioxide. Although the gamma-ray burst hypothesis is consistent with some patterns at the onset of extinction, there is no unambiguous evidence that such a nearby gamma-ray burst ever happened.

=== Volcanism ===
Though more commonly associated with greenhouse gases and global warming, volcanoes may have cooled the planet and precipitated glaciation by discharging sulphur into the atmosphere. This is supported by a positive uptick in pyritic Δ33S values, a geochemical signal of volcanic sulphur discharge, coeval with LOMEI-1.

More recently, in May 2020, a study suggested the first pulse of mass extinction was caused by volcanism which induced global warming and anoxia, rather than cooling and glaciation. Higher resolution of species diversity patterns in the Late Ordovician suggest that extinction rates rose significantly in the early or middle Katian stage, several million years earlier than the Hirnantian glaciation. This early phase of extinction is associated with large igneous province (LIP) activity, possibly that of the Alborz LIP of northern Iran, as well as a warming phase known as the Boda event. However, other research still suggests the Boda event was a cooling event instead.

Increased volcanic activity during the early late Katian and around the Katian-Hirnantian boundary is also implied by heightened mercury concentrations relative to total organic carbon. Marine bentonite layers associated with the subduction of the Junggar Ocean underneath the Yili Block have been dated to the late Katian, close to the Katian-Hirnantian boundary.

Volcanic activity could also provide a plausible explanation for anoxia during the first pulse of the mass extinction. A volcanic input of phosphorus, which was insufficient to enkindle persistent anoxia on its own, may have triggered a positive feedback loop of phosphorus recycling from marine sediments, sustaining widespread marine oxygen depletion over the course of LOMEI-1. Also, the weathering of nutrient-rich volcanic rocks emplaced during the middle and late Katian likely enhanced the reduction in dissolved oxygen. Intense volcanism also fits in well with the attribution of euxinia as the main driver of LOMEI-2; sudden volcanism at the Ordovician-Silurian boundary is suggested to have supplied abundant sulphur dioxide, greatly facilitating the development of euxinia.

Other papers have criticised the volcanism hypothesis, claiming that volcanic activity was relatively low in the Ordovician and that superplume and LIP volcanic activity is especially unlikely to have caused the mass extinction at the end of the Ordovician. A 2022 study argued against a volcanic cause of LOME, citing the lack of mercury anomalies and the discordance between deposition of bentonites and redox changes in drillcores from South China straddling the Ordovician-Silurian boundary. Mercury anomalies at the end of the Ordovician relative to total organic carbon, or Hg/TOC, that some researchers have attributed to large-scale volcanism have been reinterpreted by some to be flawed because the main mercury host in the Ordovician was sulphide, and thus Hg/TS should be used instead; Hg/TS values show no evidence of volcanogenic mercury loading, a finding bolstered by ∆199Hg measurements much higher than would be expected for volcanogenic mercury input.

===Asteroid impact===
A 2023 paper points to the Deniliquin multiple-ring feature in southeastern Australia, which has been dated to around the start of LOMEI-1, for initiating the intense Hirnantian glaciation and the first pulse of the extinction event. According to the paper, it still requires further research to test the idea.

<doc id="425756" wikidata="Q5087812" url="?curid=425756" title="Chatsworth, Ontario">
<text>Chatsworth is a township municipality in Grey County, in southwestern Ontario, Canada. The township is located at the headwaters of the Styx River, the Saugeen River, the Sauble River, the Bighead River, the Spey River, and the old Sydenham River.

The current township was formed in late year 2000 with the amalgamation of Holland Township, Sullivan Township, and the village of Chatsworth. The first white settlers arrived in this area in the early 19th century, and a significant amount of settlement was underway in mid-to-late 1800s.

The Canadian suffragette and activist Nellie McClung was born in the town of Chatsworth.

The Sullivan Township area has a large Amish population.

==Government==
The township is led by a municipal council consisting of a Mayor, a Deputy Mayor and three Council Members. The current Council, elected in 2018, comprises Scott Mackey as Mayor; Brian Gamble as Deputy mayor; and Shawn Greig, Elizabeth Thompson and Diana Rae as Councillors.

==Communities==
In addition to the town of Chatsworth itself, the township comprises the communities of Arnott, Berkeley, Desboro, Dornoch, Glascott, Grimston, Harkaway, Hemstock Mill, Holford, Holland Centre, Keady, Keward, Kinghurst, Lily Oak, Lueck Mill, Marmion, Massie, Mooresburg, Mount Pleasant, Peabody, Scone, Strathaven, Walters Falls, Williams Lake, and Williamsford.

===Arnott===
Arnott&#x27;s first post office opened on January 4, 1868. Arnott&#x27;s location has not been shown on road maps since 1976 when Highway 10 was surveyed and rerouted. Arnott had a population of 70 in 1864; it was approximately 50 in 1887. The hamlet was originally called &quot;Murray&#x27;s Corner&quot; but was renamed &quot;Arnott&quot; after a Francis Arnott who was given a grant to settle the area.

===Berkeley===
The post office in Berkeley was established in 1853 when the settlement was originally called &quot;Holland&quot;. It was renamed &quot;Berkeley&quot; in 1857. The post office also housed the general store which operated under various proprietors until 1974 when it was phased out of operation.

===Chatsworth===
Inside the township of Chatsworth sits the village of Chatsworth, Ontario where Highways 6 and 10 meet and continue together to Owen Sound. Chatsworth was settled in 1842 when a man named Coyer built a tavern.

Chatsworth had a weekly newspaper called &quot;Chatsworth News&quot; which ran from 1885 to 1935. It had a competitor called &quot;Chatsworth Banner&quot; which was also weekly and ran from 1896 to 1907.

====Recreation====
Chatsworth featured a hockey arena which closed on 30 September 2017.

The half-century-old Chatsworth Community Centre closed for good on 30 September 2017

Chatsworth Township Mayor Bob Pringle said the costs to deal with the building&#x27;s structural issues, which were outlined in an April 2017 report by GM BluePlan engineers, and to bring the arena up to today&#x27;s standards are not financially feasible for the township.

He said council unanimously approved a motion to shutter the facility Wednesday.

&quot;The engineer&#x27;s report pointed out some deficiencies that needed to be addressed for public safety. And then council with staff had to find some costs and come to some hard decisions and recommendations. The decision was made that it would close,

As well a baseball diamond. It is home to the local Chatsworth Rebels.

===Desboro===
The village of Desboro saw its first building in 1856. It was a log school house. The area was originally called Brown&#x27;s Corners. At some point its name was changed to Donnybrook and then to Desborough after a village in central England. The first house and store were built in 1866 by George Smith. The Desboro hotel was built in 1869 and was one of the only rural taverns still operating in the township before it closed in 2011. The town hall was built in 1875 and enlarged to a two-storey building in 1950.

Desboro is about 13 kilometres west of Chatsworth and Williamsford.

====Recreation====
Desboro features a modern hockey arena which was built in 1956 and has since been significantly renovated. The community grounds also contains two baseball diamonds.

===Dornoch===

The village of Dornoch was settled by Bartholomew Griffin in 1841 when he encountered a crossroads that appealed to him. The area was originally called &quot;Griffin&#x27;s Corners&quot; after Griffin started the first general store. In the late 1850s the village was served by a stage coach that was running between Durham and Chatsworth. Around the turn of the century, the name was changed to Dornoch after the village in northern Scotland. The community centre was built in 1952 and still serves Dornoch.

Dornoch is situated between Williamsford and Durham on Highway 6 and is 33 kilometers south of Owen Sound.

===Harkaway===
The Harkaway post office was established on May 1, 1875. It was closed in 1913 after rural mail delivery started in the area.

Harkaway is 10 kilometres east of Holland Centre.

===Holland Centre===
In the 1870s, local farmers got together under the leadership of Alfred Williams and got a railway station built. Williams built a general store. With well-travelled roads and a railway station, Holland Centre was well established as a lumber town. It was named &#x27;Williamsford&#x27; after the prominent resident, but with another village bearing the same name only a few miles away, it was changed to &#x27;Holland Centre&#x27; because of its location at the centre of Holland Township.

The village sits on Highway 10 and is about 10 kilometres southeast of Chatsworth.

====Recreation====
Holland Centre features a community centre and a baseball diamond. The diamond is home to the Hawks (youth softball), and men&#x27;s and ladies&#x27; Slow pitch. There is a hardball-like diamond on the other side; however, it rarely gets used and only for the youth tournaments. The Holland Center Hall is just beside the diamond.

===Keady===
Keady saw its first settlers in the 1850s. The original general store was built in the late 1860s and operated for almost 100 years before being converted into a residence.

Keady is well known in the region for its popular farmers market.

===Lily Oak===
Lily Oak is a farming community. The post office was closed in 1914 when rural mail delivery was started.

Lily Oak is about 8 kilometres east of Holland Centre.

===Massie===
The hamlet of Massie sits in the valley of the Bighead River and had settlers in the area in the 1840s. Charles Winter bought 200 acres in 1854 and the land was apportioned to various people after that. The sawmill was built in 1859 and the grist mill was built in 1863. By 1866 it also had a post office, blacksmith shop, horse shoe nail factory and a school house. There were approximately 100 people living in Massie in 1887.

Massie sits on Massie Road between Chatsworth and Walters Falls.

===Strathaven===
The hamlet of Strathaven was developing in the 1850s and in 1887 had a population of about 50 people.

Strathaven is about 6 kilometres west of Walters Falls.

===Walters Falls===

Walters Falls was founded in 1852 when John Walter of Toronto took up 300 acres of wild land on the south branch of the Bighead River. Walter set up a sawmill in 1853 with a new one being erected in 1864. This mill operated inside the village of Walters Falls which built up around it. By 1865 the town was served by a grist mill, a woolen mill, a post office, a tavern, a blacksmith, a wagon maker, two carpenters, a millwright and a tinsmith. There is conflicting information on page 149 of &#x27;The Paths that Led to Holland&#x27; which states that &quot;John Walter and his Wife Elizabeth Payne, filed entry in the District Registry Office in Durham in 1850 for 800 acres that built mills which included a grist mill, carding and saw mill.&quot;

In 1882–83 the first general store was opened in the village.

The main sawmill in the village was purchased by the Hallman family in 1944 and rebuilt after it had lain mostly idle for 22 years. It burned down on October 15, 1984 and was still utilizing a water-driven turbine up to that point to provide one-third of its energy. The fire was likely caused by an electrical accident. A new facility was rebuilt on the outskirts of the village and started operations in March 1986. The original sawmill was used for storage until the early 2000s when the remaining building was demolished and an inn was built in its place. The area surrounding the inn features a river, a dam, a large waterfall and a forest with outcroppings of the Niagara Escarpment. The area is maintained in a picturesque condition and is considered a local tourist attraction. The waterfall is just one of many in Grey County.

In the mid-1850s, John Walter also set up the feed mill which is still in operation as Walters Falls Milling Ltd., still operating on water driven machinery most of the year with a diesel engine. It suffered a fire in 1923 and was rebuilt on the same site.

The village had a population of about 200 people in 1887.

Surrounded by rolling farmland and bush, Walters Falls also sees the Bruce Trail running along the Bighead River through the bush behind the Falls Inn.

====Walters Falls Community Centre====
The Community Centre Hall was built over the period of 1883–1889. Gas lights were installed in 1923 and were replaced in 1931 when the hall was wired for electricity at a cost of $137.50. The wall behind the stage was painted by local artist Garnet Hazard in 1948 and has become an iconic fixture of the hall. It took almost 15 years for the residents of Walters Falls to convince the hall board that indoor plumbed washrooms were necessary so they finally succumbed and had them constructed in 1975.

The residents of Walters Falls celebrated the 100th birthday of the community centre on July 8, 1989. There was a parade, a horseshoe tournament and a baseball game. The evening included a concert.

===Williams Lake===
Williams Lake is a popular lake for fishing and boating in Chatsworth Township sitting between Williamsford and Holland Centre. It is a 148-acre clover-shaped body of water which was named after the Williams family that owned a large portion of the lake. It has a distinctive clover shape and features a public beach with boat launch which is located amongst the approximately 60 homes and cottages built on the shore of the lake. The first cottage built was on an island in 1948.

In 1973, a large portion on the southeast side was preserved as natural land when it was purchased by the North Grey Conservation Authority.

A railroad was built to Williams Lake in 1899 in order to dig up the grey muck known as &#x27;marl&#x27; which is prominent at the lake. The marl was excavated for the use of three cement plants in nearby Owen Sound as an ingredient for their product. The process of excavating the marl caused the water supply to dry up and several wells had to be dug on nearby farms by the excavation company.

The Glendale Yacht Club sits on private property at the north side of the lake which they moved to in 1984 after using leased property for the prior 30 years. There is a well-equipped club house, boat docks, a beach, and camp sites.

===Williamsford===

Williamsford is a village on the North Saugeen River in Grey County, Ontario, Canada (Chatsworth Township). It has a general store, post office, a bookstore and restaurant housed in an historic grain mill. A small dam controls the North Saugeen River. It has several churches, and a community cemetery. It is located on Highway 6 between Durham and Owen Sound.

The village of Williamsford was first surveyed in 1858 comprising 400 acres in preparation for a railway which was to run from Toronto to Owen Sound. Each township was to contribute $40,000 to its construction. The post office was built in 1847 and the general store was built in the late 1800s.

==== Recreation ====
At the south end of the village sit the community centre grounds. The grounds contain a playground, a baseball diamond and a newly built curling rink. The curling rink which was completed in 2010 consists of a lounge and two rinks.

The community was previously served by a hockey arena with the original attached curling rink. The arena was planned in 1954 and opened officially in 1956 and was torn down in 2008.

==Climate==
== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Chatsworth had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Hungerford&#x27;s crawling water beetle==
A short stretch of the North Saugeen River just over the Bruce County border at the Chatsworth community of Scone is home to one of the most critically endangered of all insects: the Hungerford&#x27;s crawling water beetle. The only known population of Hungerford&#x27;s crawling water beetles outside of the United States was discovered near there in 1986 when 42 beetles were identified at a site downstream from the community&#x27;s dam. An unspecified number of beetles were last recorded in 2001, but surveys in 2002 uncovered no specimens. As a result, the status of this population of Hungerford&#x27;s crawling water beetles is uncertain at present. In 2011, there were no signs of the beetle.

Although the Hungerford&#x27;s crawling water beetle was categorized as endangered on March 7, 1994, under the provisions of the U.S. Endangered Species Act, it is currently not protected in Canada.

<doc id="425757" wikidata="Q1735599" url="?curid=425757" title="Catalan nationalism">
<text>Catalan nationalism promotes the idea that the Catalan people form a distinct nation and national identity. A related term is Catalanism (, ), which is more related to regionalism and tends to have a wider meaning, most people who define themselves as &quot;Catalanist&quot; do not necessarily identify as &quot;Catalan nationalists&quot;.

Intellectually, modern Catalan nationalism can be said to have commenced as a political philosophy in the unsuccessful attempts to establish a federal state in Spain in the context of the First Republic (1873-1874). Valentí Almirall i Llozer and other intellectuals that participated in this process set up a new political ideology in the 19th century, to restore self-government, as well as to obtain recognition for the Catalan language. These demands were summarized in the so-called &quot;Bases de Manresa&quot; in 1892.

The movement had little support at first. After the Spanish–American War, in which Spain lost the last of their colonies in the Pacific and the Caribbean, these early stages of Catalanism grew in support, mostly because of the weakened Spanish international position after the war and the loss of the two main destinations for Catalan exports (Cuba and Puerto Rico).

==The origins of Catalan national identity==



During the first centuries of the Reconquista, the Franks drove the Muslims south of the Pyrenees. To prevent future incursions, Charlemagne created in 790 CE a series of Frankish counties through the conquered territory (which was occasionally called &quot;Marca Hispanica&quot;), serving as buffer states between the Frankish kingdom and Al-Andalus.

Between 878 and 988 CE, the area became a hotbed of Frankish-Muslim conflict. However, as the Frankish monarchy and the Caliphate of Córdoba both weakened during the 11th century, the resulting impasse allowed for a process of consolidation throughout the region&#x27;s many earldoms, resulting in their combination into the County of Barcelona, which became the embryo of today&#x27;s Catalonia. By 1070, Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona, had subordinated other Catalan counts and intransigent nobles as vassals. His action brought peace to a turbulent feudal system and sowed the seeds of Catalan identity. Ramon Berenguer approved a series of pacts, called the &quot;Usatges&quot;, which &quot;explicitly acknowledged legal equality between burghers … and nobility&quot; (Woolard 17). 

According to several scholars, the term &quot;Catalan&quot; and &quot;Catalonia&quot; emerged near the end of the 11th century and appeared in the compiled &quot;Usatges&quot; of 1173. Two factors fostered this identity: stable institutions and cultural prosperity. While the temporary lack of foreign invasions contributed to Catalonia&#x27;s stability, it was not a major cause. Rather, it provided a zone for sociopolitical development. For example, after the County of Barcelona signed an agreement with the Kingdom of Aragon in 1137 to create a dynastic union of both entities later known as Crown of Aragon, the system was designed to mutually check both the king&#x27;s and the nobility&#x27;s powers, while the small but growing numbers of free citizens and bourgeoisie would tactically take sides with the king in order to diminish typically feudal institutions. In 1173, Catalonia was legally delimited for the first time, while, apart from the compilation of the Usages, between 1170 and 1195 the &quot;Liber feudorum maior&quot; and the &quot;Gesta Comitum Barchinonensium&quot; were compiled and written, being considered together as the three milestones of Catalan political identity.

In addition, the estates of the realm established the &quot;Corts Catalanes&quot; (Catalan Courts), a representative body of nobles, bishops, abbots and the bourgeoisie that counterbalanced the King&#x27;s authority. By the end of the 13th century, &quot;the monarch needed the consent of the Corts to approve laws or collect revenue&quot; (McRoberts 10). Soon after, the Catalan Courts elected a standing body called the &quot;Diputació del General&quot; or the &quot;Generalitat&quot;, which included the rising upper bourgeoisie. The first Catalan constitutions were promulgated by the Catalan Courts held in Barcelona&quot; in 1283, following the Roman tradition of the Codex.

In the 13th century, King James I of Aragon conquered Valencia and the Balearic Islands. Subsequent conquests expanded into the Mediterranean, reaching Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, Naples and Greece, so by 1350 the Crown of Aragon &quot;presided over one of the most extensive and powerful mercantile empires of the Mediterranean during this period&quot; (Woolard 16). Catalonia&#x27;s economic success formed a powerful merchant class, which wielded the Corts as its political weapon. It also produced a smaller middle class, or &quot;menestralia&quot;, that was &quot;composed of artisans, shopkeepers and workshop owners&quot; (McRoberts 11).

Over the 13th and 14th centuries, these merchants accrued so much wealth and political sway that they were able to place a significant check on the power of the Aragonese crown. By the 15th century the Aragonese monarch &quot;was not considered legitimate until he had sworn to respect the basic law of the land in the presence of the &quot;Corts&quot;&quot; (Balcells 9). This balance of power is a classic example of &quot;pactisme&quot;, or contractualism, which seems to be a defining feature of the Catalan political culture.

Along with political and economic success, Catalan culture flourished in the 13th and 14th centuries. During this period, the Catalan vernacular gradually replaced Latin as the language of culture and government. Scholars rewrote everything from ancient Visigothic law to religious sermons in Catalan (Woolard 14). Wealthy citizens bolstered Catalan&#x27;s literary appeal through poetry contests and history pageants dubbed the &quot;Jocs Florals&quot;, or &quot;Floral Games.&quot; As the kingdom expanded southeast into Valencia and the Mediterranean, the Catalan language followed.

The medieval heyday of Catalan culture would not last, however. After a bout of famine and plague hit Catalonia in the mid-14th century, the population dropped from 500,000 to 200,000 (McRoberts 13). This exacerbated feudal tensions, sparking serf revolts in rural areas and political impasses in Barcelona. Financial issues and the burden of multiple dependencies abroad further strained the region.

In 1410, the king died without leaving an heir to the throne. Finding no legitimate alternative, representatives of the three Iberian realms composing the Crown of Aragon (the kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia and the Principality of Catalonia) agreed by means of the Compromise of Caspe that the vacant throne should go to the Castilian Ferdinand I, as he was among the nearest relatives of the recently extinguished House of Barcelona through a maternal line. The new dynasty began to assert the authority of the Crown, leading to a perception among the nobility that their traditional privileges associated with their position in society were at risk. From 1458 to 1479, civil wars between King John II and Catalan institutions engulfed Catalonia.

During the conflict, John II, in the face of French aggression in the Pyrenees &quot;had his heir Ferdinand married to Isabella I of Castile, the heiress to the Castilian throne, in a bid to find outside allies&quot; (Balcells 11). Their dynastic union, which came to be known as the Catholic Monarchs, marked the &quot;de facto&quot; unification of the Monarchy of Spain. At that point, however, &quot;de jure&quot; both the Castile and the states of the Crown of Aragon remained distinct entities, each keeping its own separate jurisdictions, institutions, parliaments and legislation. This was a common practice at this time in Western Europe as the concept of sovereignty lay with the monarch.

With the dawn of the Age of Discovery, led by the Portuguese, the importance of the Aragonese possessions in the Mediterranean became drastically reduced and, alongside the rise of Barbary pirates predating commerce in the Mediterranean, the theatre of European power shifted from the Mediterranean basin to the Atlantic Ocean. These political and economic restrictions impacted all segments of society. Also, because of locally bred social conflicts, Catalonia squandered in one century most of what it had gained in political rights between 1070 and 1410.

Nevertheless, early political, economic and cultural advances gave Catalonia &quot;a mode of organization and an awareness of its own identity which might in some ways be described as national, though the idea of popular or national sovereignty did not yet exist&quot; (Balcells 9). Other scholars like Kenneth McRoberts and Katheryn Woolard hold similar views. Both support Pierre Vilar, who contends that in 13th and 14th centuries &quot;the Catalan principality was perhaps the European country to which it would be the least inexact or risky to use such seemingly anachronistic terms as political and economic imperialism or &#x27;nation-state&#x27;&quot; (McRoberts 13). In other words, an array of political and cultural forces laid the foundations of Catalan &quot;national&quot; identity.

Llobera agrees with this opinion, saying, &quot;By the mid-thirteenth century, the first solid manifestations of national consciousness can be observed.&quot; Indeed, 13th- and 14th-century Catalonia did exhibit features of a nation-state. The role of Catalan Counts, the &quot;Corts&quot;, Mediterranean rule and economic prosperity support this thesis. But as Vilar points out, these analogies are only true if we acknowledge that a 14th-century nation-state is anachronistic. In other words, those living in Catalonia before latter day nationalism possessed a collective identity on which this was to be based, but this does not automatically equate to the modern concept of nation, neither in Catalonia nor elsewhere in similar circumstances during the Middle Ages.

The Catalan Courts and the rest of the autochthonous legal and political organization of the Principality of Catalonia were finally terminated in 1716, as a result of the War of the Spanish Succession. The Catalan institutions and most of local population took sides and provided troops and resources for Archduke Charles, the pretender, who was arguably expected to maintain and modernize the legal status quo. His utter defeat meant the legal and political termination of the autonomous parliaments in the Crown of Aragon, as the Nueva Planta decrees were passed and King Philip V of Spain of the new House of Bourbon sealed the transformation of Spain from a &quot;de facto&quot; unified realm into a &quot;de jure&quot; centralized state.

==The development of modern Catalanism==
The Renaixença (&quot;rebirth&quot; or &quot;renaissance&quot;) was a cultural, historical and literary movement that pursued, in the wake of European Romanticism, the recovery of the Catalans&#x27; own language and literature after a century of repression and radical political and economical changes. As time went by, and particularly immediately after the fiasco of the Revolution of 1868 (led by the Catalan general Joan Prim) and the subsequent fail of the First Spanish Republic (1873–1874), which many Catalans expected an instauration of a federal republic, the movement acquired a clear political character, directed to the attainment of self-government for Catalonia within the framework of the Spanish liberal state.

Like most Romantic currents, the Renaixença gave historical analysis a central role. History, in fact, was an integral part of Catalonia&#x27;s &quot;rebirth.&quot; Texts on Catalonia&#x27;s history — inspired by the Romantic philosophy of history — laid the foundations of a Catalanist movement. Works like Valentí Almirall i Llozer&#x27;s &quot;Lo Catalanisme&quot;, Victor Balaguer&#x27;s &quot;Historia de Cataluña y de la Corona de Aragón&quot; and Prat de la Riba&#x27;s &quot;La nacionalitat catalana&quot; used history as evidence for Catalonia&#x27;s nationhood. According to Elie Kedourie, such claims were common in 19th century nationalist discourse because &quot;the &#x27;past&#x27; is used to explain the &#x27;present,&#x27; to give it meaning and legitimacy. The &#x27;past&#x27; reveals one&#x27;s identity, and history determines one&#x27;s role in the drama of human development and progress&quot; (36). Publications of histories thus &quot;explained&quot; why the Catalans constituted a nation instead of a Spanish region or coastal province.

At the heart of many of the works of the Renaixença lay a powerful idea: the Volk. Indeed, the concept of Volk (pl. Völker) played a vital role in mainstream Catalan Romantic nationalism. It has its origins in the writings of German Romantics like Friedrich Carl von Savigny, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and, most notably, Johann Gottfried Herder.

The concept of Volk entered Catalan intellectual circles in the 1830s, stemming from the emphasis on the region&#x27;s medieval history and philology. It first appeared in the writings of Juan Cortada (1805–1868), Marti d&#x27;Eixalà (1807–1857) and his discipline, Francesco Javier Llorens y Barba, intellectuals who reinvigorated the literature on the Catalan national character. Inspired by the ideas of Herder, Savigny and the entire Scottish School of Common Sense, they asked why the Catalans were different from other Spaniards — especially the Castilians (Conversi 1997: 15) For example, Cortada wanted to determine why, despite its poor natural environment, Catalonia was so much more successful economically than other parts of Spain. In a series of generalizations, he concluded that the &quot;Catalans have succeeded in developing a strong sense of resolution and constancy over the centuries. Another feature of their character was the fact that they were hardworking people&quot; (Llobera 1983: 342). D&#x27;Eixalà and Llorens held a similar understanding of the Catalan national character. They held that two characteristics particular to Catalans were common sense (seny) and industriousness. To them, &quot;the traditional Catalan seny was a manifestation of the Volksgeist&quot;, one which made Catalans essentially different from Castilians (Llobera 2004: 75).

The early works on the Catalan &quot;Volk&quot; would remain on paper long before they entered politics. This is because the Catalan bourgeoisie had not yet abandoned the hope of spearheading the Spanish state (Conversi 1997: 14). Indeed, in the 1830s, the Renaixença was still embryonic and the industrial class still thought that it could at least control the Spanish economy. Notions of Catalonia&#x27;s uniqueness mattered little to a group that believed it could integrate and lead the entire country. But this all changed around 1880. After decades of discrimination from Spanish elites, Catalan industrialists buried their dream of leading Spain. As Vilar observes: &quot;It is only because, in its acquisition of the Spanish market, the Catalan industrial bourgeoisie did not succeed either in securing the state apparatus or identifying its interests with those of the whole of Spain, in influential opinion, that Catalonia, this little &quot;fatherland&quot;, finally became the &#x27;national&#x27; focal point&quot;, (1980: 551)

This switch of allegiance was particularly easy because the idea of a Catalan nation had already matured into a corpus of texts about the region&#x27;s &quot;uniqueness&quot; and &quot;Volksgeist&quot;. Inspired by these works of Romantic nationalism, the Catalan economic elite became conscious of &quot;the growing dissimilitude between the Catalonia&#x27;s social structure and that of the rest of the nation&quot; (Vilar 1963: 101). Consequently, Romantic nationalism expanded beyond its philosophical bounds into the political arena.

Nonetheless, this idea lost its importance, and even were abandoned by many sectors (specially from the left-wing Catalanism) during the last years of the 19th century and the first third of the 20th century, thanks to the contact with the ideas of Ernest Renan and its civic and republican concept of nation. Antoni Rovira i Virgili (1882–1949), Catalan nationalist and republican historian and politician, gave support to these ideas.

In the last third of the 19th century, Catalanism was formulating its own doctrinal foundations, not only among the progressive ranks but also amongst the conservatives. At the same time it started to establish its first political programmes (e.g. &quot;Memorial of Wrongs&quot; &quot;Bases de Manresa&quot;, 1892), and to generate a wide cultural and association movement of a clearly nationalistic character.

In 1898, Spain lost its last colonial possessions in Cuba and the Philippines, a fact that not only created an important crisis of national confidence, but also gave an impulse to political Catalanism. The first modern political party in Catalonia was the Lliga Regionalista. Founded in 1901, it formed a coalition in 1907 with other Catalanist forces (from Carlism to Federalists), grouped in the so-called &quot;Solidaritat Catalana&quot;, and won the elections with the regionalist programme that Enric Prat de la Riba had formulated in his manifesto &quot;La nacionalitat catalana&quot; (1906).

===Industrialization and Catalanism===

The 18th-century Spanish economy depended mostly on agriculture. The social structure stayed hierarchical, if not feudal, while the Catholic Church and Bourbon monarchs wrestled for internal supremacy. Into the 19th century, the Napoleonic invasion devastated the country and its early attempts in industrialization and led to chronic political instability, with Spain remaining politically and culturally isolated from the rest of Europe.

Unlike in the rest of Spain, the Industrial Revolution made some progress in Catalonia, whose pro-industry middle class strove to mechanize everything, from textiles and crafts to wineries. Industrialization and trade went hand in hand with the proto-nationalist &quot;Renaixença&quot; cultural movement, which, annoyed with the shortcomings of the Royal court in Madrid, began to fashion an alternative, and that was Catalan identity.

To finance their cultural project, a locally bred proto-nationalist intelligentsia sought patronage and protection from Barcelona&#x27;s industrial barons. This relationship played a decisive role in the development of Catalanism. On the one hand, intellectuals sought to renew Catalan identity as a response to Spain&#x27;s overall backwardness. They wanted to distance themselves from the Spanish problems by creating a new ontology rooted in Catalan culture, language and world view. On the other hand, those same intellectuals avoided demands for separation. They knew that their patrons would want Catalan nationalism to include Spain for two reasons:

* Any secession from Spain would devastate industrial markets and impoverish the region.
* The Catalan industrial class was &quot;unconditionally pro-Spanish at heart&quot; (Conversi 1997: 18).

As Woolard notes, the economic interests in Madrid and the budding Catalan industrialists converged during the 18th century, resulting in cooperation. For the nationalist literati, this meant that Catalanism could promote a national identity, but it had to function within Spain.

Furthermore, Barcelona&#x27;s industrial elite wanted Catalonia to stay part of Spain since Catalonia&#x27;s industrial markets relied on consumption from other Spanish regions which, little by little, started to join some sort of development. In fact, part of the industrialists&#x27; desire to remain part of Spain was their desire for protectionism, hegemony in domestic markets and the push to &quot;influence Madrid&#x27;s political choices by intervening in central Spanish affairs&quot; (Conversi 1997: 18–20), thus, it made no economic sense to promote any secession from Spain. On the contrary, Catalonia&#x27;s prominent industrialists acted as the Spanish leading economic heads. As Stanley Payne observes: &quot;The modern Catalan élite had played a major role in what there was of economic industrialization in the nineteenth century, and had tended to view Catalonia not as the antagonist but to some degree the leader of a freer, more prosperous Spain&quot; (482). Barcelona&#x27;s bourgeois industrialists even claimed that protectionism and leadership served the interests of the &quot;&#x27;national market&#x27; or of &#x27;developing the national economy&#x27; (national meaning Spanish here)&quot; (Balcells 19). The inclusion of Spain was instrumental to Catalonia&#x27;s success, meaning that industrialists would not tolerate any secessionist movement. Claiming that independence would have assured nothing but weak markets, an internal enemy and strengthened anarchist movements. And hence, though manufacturers funded the &quot;Renaixença&quot;—and Catalan nationalism—they demanded that Catalonia stayed part of Spain to ensure economic stability.

This federalist-like lobbying had not worked at first, nor did it succeed until the late 1880s. Finally, in 1889, the pro-industrialist &quot;Lliga Regionalista&quot; managed to save the particular Catalan Civil Code, after a liberal attempt to homogenize the Spanish legal structures (Conversi 1997: 20). Two years later, they coaxed Madrid into passing protectionist measures, which reinvigorated pro-Spanish attitudes among manufacturers. Then, they also took great profits from Spain&#x27;s neutrality in World War I, which allowed them to export to both sides, and the Spanish expansion in Morocco, which Catalan industrialists encouraged, since it was to become a fast growing market for them. Also, by the early 20th century, Catalan businessmen had managed to gain control of the most profitable commerce between Spain and its American colonies and ex-colonies, namely Cuba and Puerto Rico.

This nationalist-industrialist accord is a classic example of inclusionary Catalanism. Nationalists might have hoped for an independent Catalonia but their patrons needed access to markets and protectionism. As a result, nationalists could propagate the Catalan identity provided that it coincided with the industrialists&#x27; pro-Spanish stance. Because the &quot;Lliga Regionalista de Catalunya&quot; endorsed this compromise, it dominated Catalan politics after the start of the 20th century. Payne notes: &quot;The main Catalanist party, the bourgeois Lliga, never sought separatism but rather a more discrete and distinctive place for a self-governing Catalonia within a more reformist and progressive Spain. The &quot;Lligas leaders ran their 1916 electoral campaign under the slogan Per l&#x27;Espanya Gran&quot;&#x27; (For the Great Spain)&quot; (482). The &quot;Lliga&quot; had tempered the nationalist position to one of inclusionary nationalism. It allowed Catalanism to flourish, but demanded that it promote federalism within Spain, and not separation from it. Any deviation from this delicate balance would have enraged those pro-Catalan and Spanish-identifying industrialists. Ultimately, this prevented any moves towards separation while strengthening Catalonia&#x27;s &quot;federal&quot; rights after the Commonwealth of Catalonia took power in 1914.

===Catalanism in the 20th century===
During the first part of the 20th century, the main nationalist party was the conservative &quot;Lliga Regionalista&quot;, headed by Francesc Cambó. For the nationalists, the main achievement in this period was the Commonwealth of Catalonia, a grouping of the four Catalan provinces with limited administrative power. The Commonwealth developed an important infrastructure (like roads and phones) and promoted the culture (professional education, libraries, regulation of Catalan language, study of sciences) in order to modernize Catalonia. The failure in being granted an Estatute of autonomy in 1919 within the Restoration regime, led to radicalisation of the moderate nationalist parties in Catalonia, leading in turn to the creation of Acció Catalana (&quot;Catalan Action&quot;) and also Estat Català (&quot;Catalan State&quot;), drifting apart from the Lliga. Among the leaders of Acció Catalana founded in 1922 and chiefly supportive of liberal-democratic catalanism and a &quot;catalanisation&quot; process were Jaume Bofill, Antoni Rovira i Virgili and Lluís Nicolau d&#x27;Olwer. It also featured an internal elitist faction, moved by the thinking of Charles Maurras and Action française of which Josep Vicenç Foix and Josep Carbonell were representatives, while Jaume Bofill was ambivalent to the extreme right French thinker. Estat Català, somewhat more attached to the idea of downright independence, was founded right after the creation of Acció Catalana by Francesc Macià.

The Mancomunitat of Catalonia was dissolved during the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera in 1925. The anti-Catalan measures taken by dictator Primo de Rivera led to further disappointment among Catalan conservatives, who initially trusted in him because of an earlier support of regionalism prior to his &quot;pronunciamiento&quot; in September 1923, and also further exacerbation of insurrectionary nationalists. In November 1926 Macià helmed an attempt of military invasion of Catalonia from France which would purposely lead to a civil uprising and the proclamation of the Catalan Republic; he was not able even to get past through the border.

In 1931, the left-wing Catalan nationalist &quot;Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya&quot; (Republican Left of Catalonia, ERC) party, born as a result of the fusion of Catalan Republican Party and Estat Català, won the elections in Catalonia, advocating a Catalan Republic federated with Spain the same day of the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic. Under pressure from the new Spanish government, the leader of ERC, Francesc Macià, accepted an autonomous Catalan government instead, which recovered the historical name of Generalitat de Catalunya.

The Catalan Government broke with the Republican legality in the events of October 1934, when Lluís Companys, under the influence of the JEREC, rebelled against the Spanish government.
A dramatically short period of restoration of democratic and cultural normality was interrupted at its outset by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. The autonomous government, which was loyal to the Republic during the 1936–1939 war period, was abolished in 1939, after the victory of the Francoist troops. During the last stages of the war, when the Republican side was on the verge of defeat, Catalan president of the Generalitat, Lluís Companys, rhetorically declared Catalan independence, even though it never materialized due to objections within Catalonia and, eventually, by the defeat of the Second Spanish Republic.

Right after the war, Companys, along with thousands of Spanish Republicans, sought cover in France exiled but because of the, by that time, mutual sympathy between Franco&#x27;s government and Nazi Germany, he was captured after the Fall of France in 1940 and handed to Spanish authorities, who tortured him and which sentenced him to death for &#x27;military rebellion&#x27;. He was executed at Montjuïc in Barcelona at 6.30 a.m. on October 15, 1940. Refusing to wear a blindfold, he was taken before a firing squad of Civil Guards and, as they fired, he cried &#x27;Per Catalunya!&#x27;.

Several political or cultural Catalan movements operated underground during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, which lasted until 1975. A president of the Catalan government was still designated, and operated symbolically in exile.

Companys&#x27;s successor in exile, Josep Tarradellas, kept away from Spain until Franco&#x27;s death in 1975. When he came back in 1977, the government of Catalonia -the &quot;Generalitat&quot;- was restored again. Following the approval of the Spanish constitution in 1978, a Statute of Autonomy was promulgated and approved in referendum. Catalonia was organized as an Autonomous Community, and in 1980, Jordi Pujol, from the conservative nationalist party &quot;Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya&quot;, was elected president and ruled the autonomous government for 23 consecutive years.

In contrast, there is no significant political autonomy, nor recognition of the language in the historical Catalan territories belonging to France (Roussillon, in the French département of Pyrénées-Orientales).

===Referendum and political developments since 2006===

Currently, the main political parties which define themselves as being Catalan nationalists are &quot;Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya&quot;, &quot;Unió Democràtica de Catalunya&quot;. The &quot;Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya&quot;, although deriving from nationalism, refuses the term &quot;nationalism&quot; and prefers to describe itself as pro-independence; so does &quot;Soldaritat Catalana&quot;. These parties obtained 50.03% of the votes in the 2010 election. Within these parties, there is much divergence of opinion. More radical elements are only content with the establishment of a separate Catalan state. In contrast, more moderate elements do not necessarily identify with the belief that protection of Catalan identity is incompatible within Spain. Others vote for these parties simply as a protest and do not necessarily identify with the overall party platform (for example, some people may vote for ERC because they are simply tired of CiU, even though they do not actually desire a leftist Catalan republic). The other way around also occurs: some voters may vote for non-nationalist parties (especially the Initiative for Catalonia Greens, ICV, and the Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia, PSC) for reasons of policy, ideology or personal preference, although they share a nationalist viewpoint regarding Catalonia&#x27;s status within Spain. Some polls, conducted in 2010, show that more than a third of PSC and more than half of ICV voters support Catalonia&#x27;s independence (in the latter case, the percentage is even higher than among Convergence and Union voters); according to these polls, even 15% of the pro-Spanish Partido Popular voters in Catalonia support the region&#x27;s independence.

In 2006, a referendum was held on amending the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979 to further expand the authority of the Catalan government. It was approved by 73.24% of the voters or 35.78% of the census, and became effective as of August 9, 2006. However, the turnout of 48.84% represented an unprecedented high abstention in Catalonia&#x27;s democratic history. This has been cited both as a symptom of having large sectors in the average populace disengaged or at odds with the politics of identity in Catalonia, and, alternatively, as a symptom of fatigue among Catalan nationalists who would like to see bolder steps towards political autonomy or independence. In this regard, both &quot;Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya&quot; (Catalan pro-independence left wing) and &quot;Partido Popular&quot; (Spanish right wing) campaigned against having the 2006 Statute of Autonomy passed: the former considered it too little, the latter too much.

On September 11, 2012 between 600,000 (according to Spanish Government Delegation in Barcelona) and 2 million (according to the organisers) people gathered in central Barcelona calling for independence from Spain. In September and October, numerous Catalan municipalities declared themselves to be Free Catalan Territory.

On September 11, 2013 the Catalan Way took place, consisting of a 480-kilometre (300 mi) human chain with 1.6 million people in support of Catalan independence.

Since the economic crisis of 2008, the government of Artur Mas has moved away from its former regionalist position and come to overtly support Catalan independence. The Catalan government held a non-binding popular consultation on the subject in 2014. Catalan nationalists polled well in the 2015 election to the Catalan parliament, which Artur Mas declared to be a referendum-election.

In the 2017 Catalan regional election the nationalist parties that support the creation of an independent state (JuntsxCat, ERC and CUP) obtained a plurality of seats, but a minority of votes with less than 50%. The most voted party remained to be the non-nationalist Citizens (Cs).

===2017 referendum, Declaration of Independence and new regional elections===

In late September 2016, Puigdemont told the parliament that a binding referendum on independence would be held in the second half of September 2017, with or without the consent of the Spanish institutions. Puigdemont announced in June 2017 that the referendum would take place on 1 October, and that the question would be, &quot;Do you want Catalonia to become an independent state in the form of a republic?&quot; The Spanish government said in response, &quot;that referendum will not take place because it is illegal.&quot;

A law creating an independent republic—in the event that the referendum took place and there was a majority &quot;yes&quot; vote, without requiring a minimum turnout—was approved by the Catalan parliament in a session on 6 September 2017. Opposition parties protested against the bill, calling it &quot;a blow to democracy and a violation of the rights of the opposition&quot;, and staged a walkout before the vote was taken. On 7 September, the Catalan parliament passed a &quot;transition law&quot;, to provide a legal framework pending the adoption of a new constitution, after similar protests and another walkout by opposition parties. The same day, 7 September, the Spanish Constitutional Court suspended the 6 September law while it considered an appeal from Mariano Rajoy, seeking a declaration that it was in breach of the Spanish constitution, meaning that the referendum could not legally go ahead on 1 October. The law was finally declared void on 17 October and is also illegal according to the Catalan Statutes of Autonomy which require a two-thirds majority in the Catalan parliament for any change to Catalonia&#x27;s status.

The national government seized ballot papers and cell phones, threatened to fine people who manned polling stations up to €300,000, shut down web sites, and demanded that Google remove a voting location finder from the Android app store. Police were sent from the rest of Spain to suppress the vote and close polling locations, but parents scheduled events at schools (where polling places are located) over the weekend and vowed to occupy them to keep them open during the vote. Some election organizers were arrested, including Catalan cabinet officials, while demonstrations by local institutions and street protests grew larger.

The referendum took place on 1 October 2017, despite being suspended by the Constitutional Court, and despite the action of Spanish police to prevent voting in some centres. According to the Catalan authorities, 90% of voters supported independence, but turnout was only 43%, and there were reports of irregularities. On 10 October 2017, in the aftermath of the referendum, the President of the Generalitat of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont, declared the independence of Catalonia but left it suspended. Puigdemont said during his appearance in the Catalan parliament that he assumes, in presenting the results of the referendum, &quot;the people&#x27;s mandate for Catalonia to become an independent state in the form of a republic&quot;, but proposed that in the following weeks the parliament &quot;suspends the effect of the declaration of independence to engage in a dialogue to reach an agreed solution&quot; with the Spanish Government.
On 27 October 2017 the Catalan Parliament voted in a secret ballot to approve a resolution declaring independence from Spain by a vote of 70–10 in the absence of the constitutionalist deputies, who refused to participate in a vote considered illegal for violating the decisions of the Constitutional Court of Spain. As a result, article 155 of the Spanish constitution was triggered, the Catalan government was dismissed and direct rule was imposed from the central government in Madrid. Under direct rule from Spain, elections were held in Catalonia on 21 December 2017. The three pro-independence parties retained their control of parliament with a reduced majority of 70 seats and a combined 47.5% of valid votes cast. Inés Arrimadas&#x27; anti-independence Ciudadanos party was the most voted party with 25.4% of votes, the first time in Catalan history that a non-nationalist party won most votes and seats in an election. Parties which endorsed the suspension of autonomy by central government represented 43.5% of votes cast and parties which did not include independence in their electoral program amounted to 52.5% of the vote, notably Catcomu-Podem (7.5% of votes and 8 seats), which is opposed to independence but supports a legal referendum and denounced the suspension of autonomy. The excellent performance of the centre-right parties on both sides of the independence debate, Ciudadanos and Juntxcat, and the underperformance of all other parties (notably, left wing parties and the Partido Popular) were the most significant factor in this election result.

The 2017 Catalan independence referendum, also known by the numeronym 1-O (for &quot;1 October&quot;) in Spanish media, was an independence referendum held on 1 October 2017 in the Spanish autonomous community of Catalonia, passed by the Parliament of Catalonia as the Law on the Referendum on Self-determination of Catalonia and called by the Generalitat de Catalunya. It was declared illegal on 7 September 2017 and suspended by the Constitutional Court of Spain after a request from the Spanish government, who declared it a breach of the Spanish Constitution. Additionally, in early September the High Court of Justice of Catalonia had issued orders to the police to try to prevent it, including the detention of various persons responsible for its preparation. Due to alleged irregularities during the voting process as well as to the use of force by the National Police and Civil Guard, international observers invited by the Generalitat declared that the referendum failed to meet the minimum international standards for elections.

The referendum was approved by the Catalan parliament in a session on 6 September 2017 along with the Law of juridical transition and foundation of the Republic of Catalonia the following day 7 of September, which stated that independence would be binding with a simple majority, without requiring a minimum turnout. After being suspended, the law was finally declared void on 17 October, being also illegal according to the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia which requires a two-thirds majority, 90 seats, in the Catalan parliament for any change to Catalonia&#x27;s status.
The referendum question, which voters answered with &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;, was &quot;Do you want Catalonia to become an independent state in the form of a republic?&quot;. The &quot;Yes&quot; side won, with 2,044,038 (92.01%) voting for independence and 177,547 (7.99%) voting against, on a turnout of 43.03%. The Catalan government estimated that up to 770,000 votes were not cast due to polling stations being closed off during the police crackdown, although the &quot;universal census&quot; system introduced earlier in the day allowed electors to vote at any given polling station. Catalan government officials have argued that the turnout would have been higher were it not for Spanish and Catalan police suppression of the vote. On the other hand, many voters who did not support Catalan independence did not turn out, as the constitutional political parties asked citizens not to participate in what they considered an illegal referendum.

On the day of the referendum, the inaction of part of the autonomous police force of Catalonia, the Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra, allowed many polling stations to open. The Spanish National Police Corps and the Guardia Civil intervened and raided several polling stations after they opened. 893 civilians and 111 agents of the National Police and the Guardia Civil were reported to have been injured. According to various sources these previously reported figures may have been exaggerated. According to the judge from Barcelona who is currently investigating the accusations of police violence, there were 218 persons injured on that day in the city of Barcelona alone, 20 of whom were agents. According to the official final report by the Catalan Health Service (CatSalut) of the Generalitat 1066 civilians, 11 agents of the National Police and the Guardia Civil and 1 agent of the regional police, the Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra, were injured. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra&#x27;ad Al, urged the Spanish government to prove all acts of violence that took place to prevent the referendum. The police action also got criticism from Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch which defined it as an &quot;excessive and unnecessary use of force&quot;. Spanish Supreme Court judge Pablo Llarena stated Puigdemont ignored the repeated warnings he received about the escalation of violence if the referendum was held.

Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra are being investigated for disobedience, for allegedly not having complied with the orders of the High Court of Justice of Catalonia to prevent the referendum. Including Josep Lluís Trapero Álvarez, the Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra Major, who is being investigated for sedition by the Spanish National Court. Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra, deny those accusations and allege they obeyed the orders but applying the principle of proportionality, which is required by Spanish law in all police.

== Forms of contemporary Catalan nationalism ==

Being a broad movement, Catalan nationalism can be found in several manifestations in the current political scene. Most of the main Catalan political parties— as of 2024, Together for Catalonia (Junts), Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia (PSC), Catalunya en Comú (Comuns) and Popular Unity Candidature (CUP)—adhere to Catalanism to varying degrees, though neither the PSC nor Comuns Sumar are usually regarded as Catalan nationalist.

The scope of their national objectives diverges. While some restrict them to Catalonia-proper alone, others seek the acknowledgment of the political personality of the so-called &quot;Catalan Countries&quot;, the Catalan-speaking territories as a whole. Such claims, which can be seen as a form of Pan-nationalism, can be read in official documents of CiU, ERC and Popular Unity Candidates (CUP). Besides Catalonia, the main Catalan-speaking regions have their own nationalist parties and coalitions which support, to varying degrees, the demands for the building of a national identity for the Catalan Countries: Valencian Nationalist Bloc (BNV) in the Valencian Community, Bloc Nacional i d&#x27;Esquerres, PSM and Majorcan Union (UM) in the Balearic Islands. Other nationalist parties have existed with additional affiliations such as PSC - Reagrupament whose leader Josep Pallach i Carolà died in 1977.

The two main Catalan nationalist parties (ERC and Junts) have shown their commitment to the idea of the Catalan Countries in different ways and with different intensities. For the former CiU (from which Junts stems), this issue was not among the main items in their agenda. Nevertheless, CiU has enjoyed a long-term collaboration with the Valencian party BNV and with the Majorcan parties UM and the Socialist Party of Majorca (PSM). In contrast, Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) has taken more substantial steps in that direction by expanding the party to Roussillon, Balearic Islands and—as Republican Left of the Valencian Country (ERPV)—the Valencian Community.

Catalan nationalists see their movement as a wide one that brings together political parties and citizens from the left as well as from center and right.

<text>Michael Kidron (20 September 1930 – 25 March 2003) was a British cartographer. He was one of the early founders of the International Socialists (forerunners of the Socialist Workers Party; SWP) through the 1960s and 1970s, and the first editor of &quot;International Socialism&quot; journal. He is perhaps best remembered for writing &quot;The State of the World Atlas&quot;, jointly with Ronald Segal and Dan Smith.

==Early life and career==
Kidron was born on 20 September 1930 in South Africa to a family of Zionists. He joined his parents in Palestine just after the Second World War, and soon rejected Zionism. After schooling in Tel Aviv, he studied economics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Following emigration to the United Kingdom, he was accepted for doctoral studies at Balliol College, Oxford in 1955 under the supervision of Thomas Balogh.

Kidron became a theoretician in the Socialist Review Group (SRG) and was to be found in the extended family of Tony Cliff, who had married Kidron&#x27;s sister Chanie Rosenberg, which was the informal core of the group. He would also serve as editor and writer on various group publications through these early years.

It is Kidron&#x27;s name that appears as publisher of the first public edition of Cliff&#x27;s work &quot;State Capitalism in Russia&quot; which was published in 1955. A small pamphlet on automation appeared in 1956, which although not dissimilar to the ideas of the Johnson-Forest Tendency or &quot;Socialisme ou Barbarie&quot; did not simply dismiss existing workers organisations as these tended to do. From then on, Kidron was a major source of theoretical writing within the SRG and later the Socialist Workers Party.

==Economic writings==
Among Kidron&#x27;s many writings were &quot;Western Capitalism Since the War&quot; and &quot;Capitalism and Theory&quot; (1968). His main contribution was to develop the theory of the permanent arms economy, which argued that capitalism had been temporarily stabilised by the production of arms, which acted as a counter tendency to the falling rate of profit. Crisis, then, was not eliminated from the system, but merely postponed. This came at a time when other tendencies were emblazoning their publications with banner headlines proclaiming that capitalism had entered its final crisis. Related to this was the conception that state capitalism was a distinct period within the imperialist stage of capitalism and not simply a new label to be plastered upon the Russian state.

These ideas and experience of the workers movement in Britain were to develop a deeply rooted understanding in Kidron&#x27;s writings that the revolutionary movement must be democratic in order to fit the working class to rule. The PAE also meant that this analysis was reflected in the understanding of the IS that the &#x27;locus of reformism&#x27; had moved from parliamentary bodies to the shop floor. In short workers were seeking gains through localised class struggle at the point of production where the institution of the elected and recallable shop steward was key. The task of revolutionaries was to generalise and politicise such struggles.

Kidron was critical of the move within IS to a more traditionally democratic centralist structure in the wake of the events of 1968, and as IS grew, he moved away from its core, both physically, obtaining an academic post in Kingston upon Hull, and politically. Nonetheless, he took no direct part in the factional struggle which saw a split in the central &quot;IS&quot; cadre in 1975.

==Later work==
Kidron&#x27;s last major articles in the journal &quot;International Socialism&quot; cast doubt on his own earlier work, but without renouncing Marxism as so many former revolutionaries would during the downturn of class struggle that marked the 1980s. Yet following a debate in the pages of &quot;International Socialism&quot; with Chris Harman, who defended what is now the traditional &quot;IS&quot; position, Kidron was to leave active revolutionary politics.

He was closely associated with Pluto Press since the early 1970s (&quot;IS&quot; had helped set up the company in its first period), and his talents were expended on works such as &quot;The State of the World Atlas&quot; ( in its 9th edition), and &quot;The War Atlas&quot; ( in its 4th edition), both with Dan Smith. Kidron remained a Marxist committed to changing the world and therefore understood the necessity of developing a theoretical understanding of how the world works precisely in order to change it. His final article appeared in the Autumn 2002 issue of &quot;International Socialism&quot; on &quot;The Decline of Capitalism&quot;, and spoke of a sure and certain knowledge that another world is not just possible but demanded. As ever, the revolutionary role of the working class in the core countries of capitalism was reasserted and the goal of a communist society reaffirmed.

Mike Kidron had five children; Adam, Beeban, Cassia, Petra and Ruby.

Kidron died on 25 March 2003 at the age of 72.

<doc id="425759" wikidata="Q821929" url="?curid=425759" title="Direction – Social Democracy">
<text>Direction – Social Democracy (, Smer–SD), also commonly referred to as Smer, is a left-wing nationalist and left-wing populist political party in Slovakia led by the incumbent prime minister Robert Fico.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmidhttps://www.aktuality.sk/clanok/892314/v-smere-vym&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The party identifies as social-democratic, and was described as a combination of &quot;leftist economics and nationalist appeal&quot;.

Founded by Fico in 1999 as a split from the post-communist Party of the Democratic Left, Smer initially defined itself as the Third Way party. It adopted the epithet &quot;Social Democracy&quot; after merging with several minor centre-left parties in 2005. It has dominated Slovak politics since 2006, leading three coalition governments (2006–2010, 2016–2020, 2023–present) and one single-party government (2012–2016). During its rule in charge it continued the European integration of Slovakia, lifted some economic-liberal reforms of the previous centre-right governments and introduced various social welfare measures. Smer-led populist governments have been associated with numerous political corruption scandals, and have been accused by opponents to have resulted in a deterioration of the rule of law in Slovakia.

After the 2020 parliamentary election (Smer&#x27;s return to the opposition), Slovak authorities investigated a number of corruption-related crimes involving multiple Smer politicians and individuals reportedly linked to the party, with a total of 42 of them being convicted. At the party congress in July 2020, following a major internal split (which resulted in the founding of a new party named Voice – Social Democracy, also known as Hlas–SD), Fico announced a shift to &quot;the rustic social democracy that perceives the specifics of Slovak reality&quot;. Post-2020 Smer holds stances that have been described as nationalist, populist and Russophilic. The party is considered an example of a left-authoritarian party - a left-wing party with socially conservative stances.

In 2023, Smer won the parliamentary election with 23% of the vote and 42 seats in the National Council and subsequently formed the Fourth cabinet of Robert Fico.

== History ==
=== Foundation and early years (1999–2006) ===
Originally named Direction (), the party was founded on 8 November 1999, emerging as a breakaway from the post-Communist Party of the Democratic Left (SDĽ), the successor of the original Communist Party of Slovakia and the governing party from 1998 to 2002. Under Robert Fico, at the time one of the most popular politicians in the country, it quickly became one of the most popular parties in Slovakia, while the SDĽ experienced a constant decrease within popularity. In the 2002 Slovak parliamentary election, its first formal election period, it became the third-largest party in the National Council of the Slovak Republic, with 25 of 150 seats. In 2003, it changed its formal name to Direction (Third Way) () and Party of Civic Understanding merged into the party.

In 2005, the party absorbed the SDĽ and the Social Democratic Alternative, a small social democratic party that split from the original SDĽ somewhat later than Direction did, in addition to the Social Democratic Party of Slovakia. Founded in 1990, the party became known for the leadership of Alexander Dubček, and Direction adopted the epithet Social Democracy. Following the party&#x27;s victory in 2006, Smer entered into a coalition with the nationalist Slovak National Party (SNS) and was readmitted into the Party of European Socialists (PES) in 2008. It later formed another coalition with the SNS in 2016.

=== Government (2006–2010) ===

In the 2006 Slovak parliamentary election, the party won 29.1% of the popular vote and 50 of 150 seats. Following that election, Smer formed a coalition government with the People&#x27;s Party – Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and the Slovak National Party (SNS), an extremist nationalist party. The coalition was described as &quot;anti-market left&quot; and &quot;Slovak national&quot;, given its socioeconomically left-wing but also nationalist policies.

On 12 October 2006, the party was temporarily suspended from membership in the PES. The resolution to suspend the party referred specifically to the PES Declaration &quot;For a modern, pluralist and tolerant Europe&quot;, adopted in Berlin by the PES congress in 2001, which states that &quot;all PES parties adhere to the following principles ... [and] to refrain from any form of political alliance or co-operation at all levels with any political party which incites or attempts to stir up racial or ethnic prejudices and racial hatred.&quot; In &quot;The Slovak Spectator&quot;, the PES chairman Poul Nyrup Rasmussen commented: &quot;Most of our members stood solidly behind our values, according to which forming a coalition with the extreme right is unacceptable.&quot; The party was readmitted on 14 February 2008 after its chairman Fico and SNS leader Jan Slota pledged in a letter to respect European values, human rights, and all ethnic minorities.

=== Opposition (2010–2012) ===

Although the party won the most votes in the 2010 Slovak parliamentary election, with a lead of 20% over the second-place Slovak Democratic and Christian Union – Democratic Party (SDKÚ), they had not been able to form a government because of losses sustained by their coalition partners. Their result, 34.8%, gave them 62 of 150 seats in the National Council, but the HZDS failed to cross the 5% threshold, losing all their seats, and the SNS was reduced to nine seats. The four opposition centre-right parties (the Christian Democratic Movement, Freedom and Solidarity, Bridge, and SDKÚ) were able to form a new government.

=== Government (2012–2020) ===

In the 2012 Slovak parliamentary election, Smer won 44.4% of the votes and became the largest party in the National Council, with an absolute majority of 83 seats (out of 150). Fico&#x27;s Second Cabinet was the first single-party government in Slovakia since 1993. In the 2014 European Parliament election in Slovakia, Smer came in first place nationally, receiving 24.09% of the vote and electing four Members of the European Parliament.

Despite suffering a significant loss in support as a result of strikes by teachers and nurses earlier in the year, Smer won the 5 March 2016 parliamentary election with 28.3% of the vote and 49 of 150 seats, and subsequently formed Fico&#x27;s Third Cabinet in a coalition government with Bridge, Network, and the Slovak National Party. Prime Minister Fico resigned in the wake of the political crisis following the murder of Ján Kuciak and was replaced by Peter Pellegrini, with the same majority. However, Fico remained leader of Smer.

=== Opposition (2020–2023) ===

The party managed to score 18.29% in the 2020 Slovak parliamentary election, which was 2 to 3 percent more than the latest polls showed, but it was still a decrease of 10% compared to previous elections. The party occupied 38 seats in parliament. Pellegrini, the chairman of the Fico parliamentary group, became the vice-chairman of the National Council for the Opposition on the basis of post-election negotiations. In May 2020, two deputies for Smer (Ján Podmanický and Marián Kéry) founded a value policy platform with deputies from KDŽP, elected as a candidate of the Kotlebists – People&#x27;s Party Our Slovakia. Because of this, Pellegrini sharply criticized them, while Fico defended Podmanický. In May 2020, Podmanický also left the Smer parliamentary group after criticism from his own ranks.

As early as April 2020, party vice-chairman Pellegrini announced his ambition to run for party chairman as Smer&#x27;s most popular politician, winning 170,000 more votes than the chairman. Fico reacted strongly, saying that he did not intend to resign and wanted to remain at the head of the party, while Pellegrini gradually began to tighten his criticism of Fico and the party&#x27;s situation. Pellegrini criticized the fact that the party&#x27;s presidency had not met since the election and the date of the parliament was unknown. Pellegrini demanded that the assembly be held as soon as possible, while Fico insisted that the nomination assembly take place only at a ceremonial assembly in December 2020.

At a June 2020 press conference in Banská Bystrica, Pellegrini announced that he would resign as vice-chairman of Smer and leave the party in the near future. He also outlined the establishment of a new party, Voice – Social Democracy (Hlas–SD), which he said should be social democratic, but refuse to be liberal. Around that time, Fico had already offered Pellegrini the position of party chairman, provided that he maintained his influence in the party, an offer which was rejected by Pellegrini. In the first FOCUS survey, 21.4% of respondents said they would vote for the new Pellegrini party, while those saying they would vote for the original Smer remained at 9.6%. At a press conference one week following the announcement of Pellegrini&#x27;s departure, another 10 deputies announced they would leave the party, including Vice-presidents Peter Žiga and Richard Raši, Bureau member Denisa Saková and long-standing deputies and party members. At the same time, together with Pellegrini, they announced the creation of a new social-democratic party at the press conference, which they would join. Political scientist Grigory Mesezhnikov postulated that after the departure of the Pellegrini group, the Smer could move further to the left into the spectrum of the radical to communist left.

=== Government (2023–present) ===

As Smer won the parliamentary election held on 30 September 2023 with 23% of the vote and 42 seats in the National Council, Robert Fico, the party&#x27;s leader was given a mandate to form a government. The Fourth cabinet of Robert Fico comprising Smer, Voice – Social Democracy (Hlas–SD) and the Slovak National Party (SNS) sworn in on 25 October 2023.

==== Foreign policy ====
Fico has promised to cut all aid to Ukraine as a result of the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, and has promised to block Ukrainian accession to NATO should the subject be broached under his tenure. Fico has also stated that the Ukrainian government is run by neo-Nazis.

==== Legal reforms ====

In December 2023, the Fourth Cabinet of Robert Fico introduced an amendment to the Criminal Code. The government proposed that the bill be debated in a fast-track legislative procedure, arguing that the status quo leads to human rights violations. The amendment included scrapping the Special Prosecutor&#x27;s Office dealing with high-level corruption and lowering penalties for financial crimes. The fast-track legislative procedure faced widespread criticism from the parliamentary opposition, President Zuzana Čaputová, the European Commission and non-governmental organizations, resulting in a weeks-long opposition parliamentary obstruction and a series of demonstrations.

Critics have raised questions about potential conflicts of interest within the government coalition. They have noted that various individuals with perceived affiliations to the government, alongside accused members of the coalition parties, including the bill&#x27;s rapporteur, MP Tibor Gašpar of Smer, could be directly affected by the proposed lowering of penalties. Additionally, their cases are overseen by the Special Prosecutor&#x27;s Office, which the amendment would abolish. The coalition government introduced the amendment, citing the need to shift towards a rehabilitative approach to justice, update the criminal code, and align with European Union standards. Proponent of the law, the Ministry of Justice led by Boris Susko of Smer published the brochure &#x27;Overview of Violations of the Principles of the Rule of Law in the Years 2020–2023.&#x27;

The amendment was finally approved by the National Council on 8 February 2024. The final proposal also included a reduction of the statute of limitations in rape cases from 20 to 10 years, which again caused widespread criticism from the parliamentary opposition, President Zuzana Čaputová and non-governmental organizations. The government defended the reduction of the limitation period by motivating victims to report rape earlier, possibly allowing a return to the 20-year limitation period in the next amendment after the approval of the law.

President Zuzana Čaputová signed the law on 16 February, verbally clearly expressing her opposition to its content. The President argued that by signing the law instead of vetoing it, she wants to create enough time for the Constitutional Court to decide on her submission challenging the constitutionality of the law. As of February 2024, the Constitutional Court is expected to make its decision following the publication of the law in the collection of laws by the Ministry of Justice.

== Ideology and policies ==
Direction – Social Democracy has been recognised as a social-democratic party, and is considered a centre-left and a left-wing party. Additionally, it has also been variously described as anti-establishment, nationalist, left-authoritarian, populist, centrist populist, social populist, left-wing populist, and national populist. The party has been recognised as diverging from the typical Western European social-democratic tradition due to its rejection of postmaterial values. 

Slovak political scientists Grigorij Mesežnikov and Oľga Gyárfášová argue that Smer is a social-democratic party (thus matching its self-identification), but one with very strong nationalist and populist elements that also include aspects of social conservatism. Tim Haughton states that the party &quot;conveys both a Slovak version of social democracy and a stronger national emphasis&quot;; he also stressed that the party cannot be seen as right-wing or far-right, but rather as one that combines &quot;leftist economics and nationalist appeal&quot;.
=== Economic policy ===
Smer advocates economically left-wing policies. The main economic proposals of the party focus on the establishment of a welfare state and supporting the poorest groups of Slovakia. Many of the party&#x27;s socioeconomic policies, such as free travel for pensioners and pension increases are considered typically left-wing populist. The party also promotes redistributive policies, such as corporate tax increases and income tax hikes for the highest earners. 

Smer also adheres to economic nationalism; Grigorij Mesežnikov noted that &quot;Smer openly subscribes to etatism as the foundation of its political profile and advocates government&#x27;s strong role in a number of areas&quot; and called its economic policy &quot;etatist paternalism&quot;, while also arguing that the party also represents &quot;socio-economic policies based on social-democratic values&quot;. Robert Fico, the leader of the party, argued that the government should be &quot;the father of all citizens&quot; and stated that a strong state is necessary to improve the socioeconomic conditions of Slovak citizens.

The party presents its economic policies as being &quot;social&quot; and &quot;pro-ordinary people&quot;, and its proposals also included the introduction of differential VAT rates, replacement of flat income tax rate with a progressive one that would tax the lower-income groups much less and reduction of excise duty on fuel oils. In regards to the Slovak healthcare system, the party advocated a ban of manipulation feels as well as a halt to the privatization of public health system. Smer also made pledges to cancel payment of tuition fees for regular university sutudents and establishing a dynamic minimum wage that would be fixed to the 60% of average salary. The party is highly critical of other slovak parties, accusing them of implementing &quot;anti-social&quot; policies that neglect the poor while benefitting the rich. Robert Fico argued that the neoliberal economic policy of the Mikuláš Dzurinda threw Slovakia &quot;back to the 1930s&quot;.

In its economic rhetoric, SMER also frequently attacks monopolies, arguing that the increase in gas prices is caused by the &quot;ruthless pricing policy of monopolies&quot; that are &quot;raking in exorbitant profits&quot;. The party is also critical of the banking industry, stating that Slovak banks tend to collect unfairly high service fees from their client; the party promoted itself as one willing to ban or limit the service fees of Slovak banks. In regards to Slovak banks, Robert Fico said: &quot;The banks operating in Slovakia must realize that they operate on the territory of a sovereign state, which must use all available means to bring a pressure to bear on the banking sector.&quot; In response to criticism of his remarks, Fico also argued that the political opponents of Smer are &quot;conveying the fears of international corporations and financial groups that literally govern this country and now they have understood that once our program is implemented, the gold rush in Slovakia will be over.&quot; This reveals a highly nationalist orientation of the party.

=== Foreign policy ===
Smer holds Russophilic and Eurosceptic stances on foreign policy; however, it claims to support Slovakia&#x27;s membership in the European Union and NATO. The party expresses strong anti-Western, especially anti-American sentiment, often spreading Russian propaganda narratives.

Regarding the Russo-Ukrainian War, Smer calls for an end to military aid to Ukraine as well as to sanctions against Russia. It interprets the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a proxy war between the US and Russia, with the latter &quot;dealing with threats to its national interests&quot;. The party declares that the conflict was provoked in 2014 by &quot;the extermination of citizens of Russian nationality by Ukrainian fascists&quot;.

However, since his return to power, Fico has taken a somewhat different line on Ukraine than during his election campaign. During a meeting with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal in January 2024, Fico promised not to block private Slovak arms companies from selling to Ukraine, not to block EU financial support for Ukraine, and to support the accession of Ukraine to the European Union. He described Slovakia&#x27;s political differences with Ukraine as &quot;minor&quot; and claimed to support Ukraine&#x27;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

In the 2000s, the party opposed the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan, and organized the withdrawal of 110 Slovak soldiers that were deployed in Iraq.

In its foreign policy manifesto, Smer calls for understanding with countries &quot;with a form of government other than parliamentary democracy&quot;, referring to China and Vietnam. During his premiership, party&#x27;s leader Robert Fico praised the political systems of both countries, describing the Slovak one as clumsy and uncompetitive in comparison. In 2007, Fico made an official state visit to the then leader of Libya, Muammar Gaddafi, &quot;discussing the fight against world imperialism&quot; (citing Fico).

==== European affiliation ====
In October 2023, Smer was suspended from the Party of European Socialists (PES) and the affiliated Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D) European Parliament group., following its formation of a coalition government with the Slovak National Party. After the 2024 European Parliament election, Smer unsuccessfully sought to rejoin the S&amp;D group. Smer subsequently declined to join the Fidesz-led Patriots for Europe group, stating that it would not join a non-leftist group.

In September 2024, Smer began negotiations with two other parties in the Non-Inscrits, the German Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht and the Czech Stačilo!, on establishing cooperation between left-wing conservative parties.

=== Social policy ===
SMER is considered an example of a left-conservative party. It encompasses socially conservative and nationalist elements, such as &quot;emphasising Slovak folk traditions, mythicalising the nation&#x27;s history, offering open and pragmatic support from its chairman Robert Fico to the Catholic bishops, and rejecting the rights of non-heterosexual minorities&quot;. 

The party holds socially conservative views on social issues with a record of anti-LGBT, anti-Romani, Islamophobic, anti-immigration and sexist statements. It proclaims its strong opposition to liberalism and progressivism, advocating traditional family values and running for the patriotic electorate. Party&#x27;s leading politicians spread disinformation and conspiracy theories, including antisemitic George Soros conspiracy theories.

Regarding LGBT rights, it calls for a constitutional ban on same-sex civil unions, marriages as well as adoptions. It opposes the allocation of state subsidies to LGBT rights organizations. In 2022, 21 out of 27 Smer deputies in the National Council voted for a bill prohibiting the display of the rainbow flags on public buildings while the remaining 6 were absent.

During the 2015 European migrant crisis, party&#x27;s leader Robert Fico stated that the government monitors every single Muslim who is on the territory of the Slovak Republic. In 2016, Fico declared that Islam has no place in Slovakia. He challenged multiculturalism and called for the preservation of the country&#x27;s traditions and identity. In 2021, Fico called on political scientist Jozef Lenč of the Muslim faith, commenting on Smer, not to work as a political scientist in a Christian country.

In 2019, Fico expressed his sympathy for the Member of the National Council of the neo-Nazi People&#x27;s Party Our Slovakia Milan Mazurek, who was convicted of the intentional crime of defaming a nation, race or belief. In 2022, Smer criticized the proposal for a comprehensive compensatory social benefit for people in need, interpreting it as buying Roma votes before local and regional elections. Fico&#x27;s rhetoric towards the Romani people in Slovakia is considered hostile, stating that the Romani people in Slovakia drain the social system.

In 2023, Fico called for the approval of a law concerning NGOs, according to which non-governmental organizations with foreign funding should be labeled as foreign agents.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the party opposed vaccinations and restrictive measures.

It opposed the ratification of the Istanbul Convention in Slovakia.

=== Communist nostalgia ===
Following a major internal split in June 2020 (which resulted in the founding of a new party named Voice – Social Democracy, also known as Hlas–SD), the party began to radicalize its rhetoric, including expressing nostalgia for the prior communist state.

The party politicians utilize slogans reminiscent of the communist era, such as &quot;Loiterers from cafes, to fields and factories&quot; and the greeting &quot;Greetings, comrades! Honor work!&quot;

In January 2024, Prime Minister and party chairman Robert Fico and Deputy Speaker of the National Council and party vice-chairman Ľuboš Blaha visited the grave of Gustav Husák, the last communist president of the Czechoslovakia, to pay their respects. Husák, a highly controversial figure, was one of the leading figures of the Slovak National Uprising during the Second World War, imprisoned as a bourgeois nationalist in the 1950s to emerge as a key figure in the normalization process in Czechoslovakia – a return to strict Communist Party control and the suppression of political liberalization following the Warsaw Pact invasion in 1968.

In November 2023, Blaha replaced a portrait of President Zuzana Čaputová in his parliamentary office with a portrait of Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara, hanging the Flag of Europe.

In his speech at the Smer-organized commemoration of the anniversary of the Slovak National Uprising in August 2023, Blaha addressed the crowd as &quot;comrades&quot; and stated, &quot;The basic historical truth is that war and fascism have always come from the West and freedom and peace from the East.&quot;

In December 2019, Blaha shared a photograph on Facebook depicting himself alongside Fico, with the former holding a red star bearing a hammer and sickle motif. The star was a birthday gift presented to Blaha by Fico.

== Legal issues ==
Since the 2020 parliamentary election – Smer&#x27;s return to the opposition, Slovak authorities have been investigating a number of corruption-related crimes. By August 2023, a total of 42 individuals reportedly linked to the party, including policemen, prosecutors, judges, members of the Slovak intelligence agency, politicians, officials, and businessmen were convicted. The party strongly rejects all charges, calling it criminalization of politics. Numerous criticisms of the investigation process and the Special Prosecutor&#x27;s Office were outlined in the brochure &#x27;Overview of Violations of the Principles of the Rule of Law in the Years 2020–2023&#x27; published by the Ministry of Justice led by Boris Susko of Smer in December 2023.

In March 2023, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, Robert Kaliňák, who previously served as Minister of Interior, and businessman Jozef Brhel were formally indicted with bribery. Kaliňák was identified as the intermediary in a bribery scheme involving an annual sum of €200,000, purportedly arranged by Brhel for František Imrecze, who served as the President of the Financial Administration at the time. In return for the alleged bribery, Imrecze facilitated the passing of information regarding entities scheduled for corporate income tax audits and ensured the fulfillment of requirements for filling positions within the Financial Administration with specific individuals recommended by Brhel. In one instance, the Financial Administration then awarded substantial IT contracts to Michal Suchoba&#x27;s company, Allexis, while Suchoba himself is now a cooperating defendant. Imrecze, also a cooperating defendant, stated that the total amount of bribes involved was €1,100,000. The indictment was also based on the statements of other high-ranking officials, now cooperating defendants: the former director of the Criminal Office of the Financial Administration, Ľudovít Makó, and the former director general of the tax and customs administration section, Daniel Čech. In June 2023, the indictment was quashed by the Supreme Court citing &quot;serious procedural errors that infringed upon the defendants&#x27; right to a fair defense&quot;. In August 2023, Deputy Prosecutor General Jozef Sedlák canceled the charges for Kaliňák, while Brhel remained charged.

In November 2020, Tibor Gašpar of Smer, a member of the National Council and former Police President, was formally charged with organizing a criminal group. According to the charge, the criminal group composed predominantly of members of the police force was founded by Gašpar in collaboration with businessman Norbert Bödör in 2012. The alleged activities of the group involved serving the interests of Bödör while engaging in illegal activities such as obstructing investigations into tax evasion, extortion, bribery, and utilizing police resources and technology for their operations. Gašpar and Bödör were purportedly at the top of the three tiers hierarchical criminal group. In one instance, allegations suggested that a private company, Interstore Group, sought to evade a criminal investigation. It was alleged that their request was to be fulfilled through a €400,000 bribe distributed among the members of the group, with Gašpar receiving €90,000 through an intermediary. In November 2022, Prosecutor General Maroš Žilinka canceled the charges in compliance with the proposal of Prime Minister and party chairman Robert Fico and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Robert Kaliňák. Žilinka described the charges as vague and imprecise, stating that they violated the basic principles of criminal proceedings.

In December 2023, Gašpar was accused of breaching the confidentiality of oral expression and other expression of a personal nature by complicity.

In April 2022, Robert Fico, Robert Kaliňák, Tibor Gašpar and Norbert Bödör were officially charged with endangering commercial, banking, postal, telecommunications and tax secrets, with Fico and Kaliňák additionally charged with organizing a criminal group and abuse of authority. Fico and Kaliňák allegedly misused state authorities and collaborated with other members of the group to illegally acquire information aimed at discrediting political adversaries, namely the then opposition leaders Igor Matovič and Andrej Kiska. In November 2022, Prosecutor General Maroš Žilinka canceled the charges in compliance with the proposal of Fico and Kaliňák.

In April 2023, Peter Kažimír, former Minister of Finance and former vice-chairman of the party, was convicted by the Specialized Criminal Court for bribery. According to the indictment supported by the testimony of cooperating defendant František Imrecze, Kažimír allegedly gave a bribe of €48,000 to Imrecze, who was then the President of the Financial Administration. The alleged purpose of the bribe was to expedite and ensure a favorable outcome in tax appeal proceedings concerning two private companies. Kažimír denied all the charges and appealed against the verdict. As of 2024, the trial is still ongoing.

In 2021, Bernard Slobodník, a cooperating defendant who formerly served as the director of the National Financial Police Unit, testified that State Secretary of Justice Pavol Gašpar of Smer, son of Tibor Gašpar, was supposed to hand over a bribe of €60,000 in exchange for information from the investigation. An investigation into the allegation was not initiated because it was already time-barred.

Monika Jankovská of Smer, former State Secretary of Justice and former member of the National Council, testified about the alleged involvement in corrupt practices within the judiciary, admitting her own criminal activity.

<text>The Christian-Democratic People&#x27;s Party (, PPCD) is a Christian-democratic political party in Moldova. The party was led by Iurie Roșca from 1994 until 2011. Until 2005, the PPCD and the (Moldovan) National Liberal Party were the main political organizations in the country supporting the unification of Moldova and Romania. After the PPCD began supporting the anti-unification Communist President Vladimir Voronin, the party has lost its unionist credentials while other parties such as the Liberal Party have taken over the pro-Romanian ideological space. The party has had very poor results in all subsequent elections. Since April 2005, the PPCD has lost several deputies, mayors, councillors and members to the liberal-democratic parties. The PPCD was an informal coalition partner of the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova from 2005–2009.

== History ==

It is the successor of the Democratic Movement of Moldova (1988–1989), Popular Front of Moldova (1989–1992), and the Christian Democratic Popular Front (1992–1999). In March 2005, the party became an observer member of the European People&#x27;s Party.

The 2002 one-month suspension of party&#x27;s activities was found to be in violation of its freedoms of assembly and association by the European Court of Human Rights in 2006.

<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives,  represents the wheel arrangement of four leading wheels on two axles, eight powered and coupled driving wheels on four axles and four trailing wheels on two axles. The type was first used by the Northern Pacific Railway, and initially named the Northern Pacific, but railfans and railroad employees have shortened the name since its introduction. It is most-commonly known as a Northern.
==Overview==

===Development===

The wheel arrangement was a progression from the Mountain type and, like the Berkshire and Hudson types, an example of the &quot;Super Power&quot; concept in steam locomotive design that made use of the larger firebox that could be supported by a four-wheel trailing truck, which allowed greater production of steam. The four-wheel leading truck gave stability at speed and the eight driving wheels gave greater adhesion. The type evolved in the United States soon after the Lima Locomotive Works introduced the concept of &quot;Lima Super Power&quot; in 1925, making heavy 2-8-2 and 2-8-4 locomotives. The prototype was built by American Locomotive Company (ALCO) for the Northern Pacific Railway (NP) in 1926, with a very large firebox with a grate, designed to burn low quality lignite coal. The four-wheel trailing truck weighed about more than two-wheel trucks of the time and could carry an additional of engine weight; the difference of was available for increased boiler capacity.
The type arrived when nearly all the important steam locomotive design improvements had already been proven, including Superheaters, mechanical stokers, outside valve gear and the Delta trailing truck. One-piece, cast steel bed-frames with integrally cast cylinders gave the strength and rigidity to use Roller bearings. In 1930, the Timken Company used the Timken 1111, a built by ALCO with roller bearings on all axles, to demonstrate the value of their sealed roller bearings. The Timken 1111 was subsequently sold to the NP, where it became NP No. 2626, their sole Class A-1 locomotive.

The stability of the wheel arrangement meant that driving wheels up to diameter could be used for high speed passenger and fast freight operation. Lateral control devices allowed these locomotives to traverse relatively sharp curves despite their drivers. The increased boiler size possible with this type, together with the high axle loads permitted on mainlines in North America, resulted in the design of some massive locomotives, some of which weighed as much as 450 tons, including the tender. The was suitable for both express passenger and fast freight service, though it was not suited to heavy drag freight trains.

Although locomotives of the wheel arrangement were used in a number of countries, those that were developed outside North America included various design features which set them apart from North American practice. Scaled down examples of the type were exported by two American builders, ALCO and Baldwin Locomotive Works, for lines in Brazil. Most were two-cylinder locomotives, but five classes of three-cylinder s were built:
* The simplex 06 class by the Deutsche Reichsbahn in Germany.
* The simplex H class by the Victorian Railways in Australia.
* The compound 242A1 class of the Société nationale des chemins de fer français (SNCF) in France.
* The simplex 477 class tank engines by CKD for Czechoslovak State Railways; 60 4-8-4T locomotives were built between 1951 and 1955, the last new steam engines built in Czechoslovakia. 
* An experimental high-pressure compound locomotive of the New York Central (NYC).

===The Northern name===
Since the was first used by the Northern Pacific Railway, the type was named &quot;Northern&quot;. Most North American railroads used this name, but some adopted different names.
* &quot;Heavy Mountain&quot; or &quot;New Mountain&quot; on the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe (ATSF). Original blueprints of class 3751 designate the 4-8-4 as a &quot;Mountain&quot; or &quot;Heavy Mountain&quot;. The index to the blueprints reference the 3751 class as &quot;Mountain, 4-Wheel Trailer&quot;. Early correspondence of the ATSF refer to this type as &quot;New Mountains&quot;. The Santa Fe never adopted the &quot;Northern&quot; designation. 
* &quot;Big Apple&quot; on the Central of Georgia Railway (CG).
* &quot;Confederation&quot; on the Canadian National Railway (CN), named because they were purchased in 1927, the 60th anniversary of Canada&#x27;s confederation in 1867. The &quot;Confederation&quot; 4-8-4s were later renamed by the CN to the generic &quot;Northern&quot; name in later years.
* &quot;Dixie&quot; on the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway (NC&amp;StL).
* &quot;Golden State&quot; on the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP), temporarily renamed &quot;General Service&quot; during the Second World War and also referred to as &quot;GS&quot; by Western Pacific for those GSs which were diverted to the WP from SP&#x27;s order by the War Production Board.
* &quot;Greenbrier&quot; on the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O).
* &quot;J&quot; on the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&amp;W).
* &quot;FEF&quot; (Four-Eight-Four) on the Union Pacific Railroad (UP).
* &quot;Niagara&quot; on the New York Central Railroad (NYC).
* &quot;Niágara&quot; on the (N de M) and in Brazil.
* &quot;Pocono&quot; on the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (Lackawanna).
* &quot;Potomac&quot; on the Western Maryland Railway (WM).
* &quot;Wyoming&quot; on the Lehigh Valley Railroad (LV).

The Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad (RFP) gave each of its three classes a separate name, the &quot;General&quot; of 1937, the &quot;Governor&quot; of 1938 and the &quot;Statesman&quot; of 1944.

===Demise===
The big-wheeled was at home on heavy passenger trains and quite capable of speeds over , but freight was the primary revenue source of the railroads; in that service the Northern had limitations. The adhesive weight on a was limited to about 60% of the engine&#x27;s weight, not including the dead weight of the tender. Henry Bowen, the Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) from 1928 to 1949, tested the first two CPR K-1a Northerns introduced by his predecessor, then he designed a Selkirk type using the same boiler. The resulting T-1a Selkirk locomotive had the same number of axles as the Northern, but the driving wheels were reduced from in diameter, while the additional pair of driving wheels increased the tractive effort by 27%. In a later variant, Bowen added a booster to the trailing truck, enabling the Selkirk to exert nearly 50% more tractive effort than the similar-sized K-1a Northern.

When it was demonstrated that a three-unit EMD F3 diesel-electric consist that weighed slightly less than the total engine and tender mass of a CPR K-1a Northern could produce nearly three times its tractive effort, high-powered steam locomotives were retired as quickly as finance allowed.

==Usage==

===Australia===
A total of twenty-three locomotives operated in Australia, built to three distinct designs.

In 1929, the ten gauge South Australian Railways 500 class Mountain types of 1926 were equipped with steam boosters in the form of small auxiliary steam engines to increase their power. This necessitated the replacement of their two-wheel trailing trucks with four-wheel bogies. The booster contributed an additional to the tractive effort and permitted an increase in the locomotive&#x27;s load across the Mount Lofty Ranges to 540 tons. In their new configuration, they were reclassified to 500B class.
In 1943, the first of twelve streamlined South Australian Railways 520 class locomotives were delivered from the Islington Workshops in Adelaide. Although they were large locomotives, they were designed to run on lightly constructed track, with the engine&#x27;s weight being spread over eight axles. Their -diameter coupled wheels were specially balanced for running.
The H class three-cylinder of the Victorian Railways, built in 1941, was designed for heavy passenger work on the line between Melbourne and Adelaide. Nicknamed &quot;Heavy Harry&quot;, it was the largest steam locomotive built in Australia and, after the NSWGR D57 4-8-2 and the South Australian Railways 500/500B class, the third-most-powerful non-articulated locomotive. It was one of the five Australian classes of three-cylinder locomotives.

Construction of three locomotives commenced at the Newport Workshops in 1939 and three sets of frames were manufactured. Although work was halted due to the outbreak of the Second World War, a shortage of motive power caused by increased wartime traffic resulted in authorisation being given for the completion of class leader H220. The locomotive went into service on 7 February 1941, but remained the sole member of the class because the other two partly-built locomotives were never completed. Since the necessary upgrades to the Adelaide line was deferred, H220 operated only on the line between Melbourne and Albury in New South Wales.

===Brazil===
To meet the acute locomotive shortages in Brazil after the Second World War, 27 scaled down American Niágara locomotives were ordered by the Brazilian (DNEF) from ALCO in 1946. These locomotives were supplied to the (VFRGS), which then purchased another fifteen directly from ALCO in 1947. They were designated the 1001 class. In 1956 and 1957, some of them were sold to Bolivia. The Baldwin Locomotive Works supplied similar locomotives to the (RMV no. 601 to 604), the (RVPSC no. 801 to 806) and the (NOB no. 621 to 623).

After his retirement from the (SNCF) in France, French engineer André Chapelon was appointed as the chief designer of locomotives at the French state-owned sales consortium (GELSA). In 1949, a contract was signed between DNEF and GELSA for the construction of 24 locomotives with a axle load. The order also included 66 Berkshires. All ninety locomotives were delivered by January 1953.

The 24 class 242F Niágara locomotives were built by Société de Construction des Batignolles (). They were two-cylinder simple expansion locomotives, designed to burn poor quality local coal with a low calorific thermal value, with coupled wheels of diameter and a grate area of . They were coupled to big tenders which a coal capacity of . The Belpaire firebox included a combustion chamber and the boiler pressure was a high . One member of the class was tested on the Reseau Breton line in France before being shipped to Brazil.

The DNEF allocated the locomotives to four of Brazil&#x27;s state railways. Under Brazilian railway conditions, these modern locomotives were not popular with local railwaymen and were not used as much as had been hoped. Their maximum axle load of restricted their usefulness, as did their long tenders. In some places the turntables were too short to turn the locomotives and they had to be turned on triangles. In addition, the building specifications had called for a locomotive capable of a maximum speed of and the ability to negotiate curves with a minimum radius of . This last point proved to be a source of contention when it was later discovered that the curves in some places were of less than radius. As a consequence, the locomotives were involved in a number of derailments.

In the late 1960s, they were relegated down from first class passenger trains. Some locomotives, allocated to Southern Brazil, were also tried in Bolivia.

===Canada===
Since the Canadian mainlines were generally laid with rail, Canadian were heavy and weighed in with axle loads up to .

When the Canadian National Railway (CN) introduced its first in 1927, it used the name &quot;Confederation&quot; for the type, to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Canadian Confederation. The CN employed a total of 160 Confederation locomotives.

* Altogether forty locomotives were delivered in 1927, twenty Class U-2-a from the Canadian Locomotive Company and twenty Class U-2-b from the Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW).
* Another twenty Class U-2-c came from MLW in 1929 and another five Class U-2-d, also from MLW, in 1936.
* The CN U-4a was one of the few streamlined Confederation types, with five locomotives built by MLW and also introduced in 1936. U-4a No. 6400 achieved fame in 1939 by heading the royal train (see 1939 royal tour of Canada) and being exhibited at the New York World&#x27;s Fair in the same year.
* Between 1940 and 1944, a total of ninety more Confederation locomotives, built in four batches, were added to the CN roster.

The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) experimented with the wheel arrangement in 1928, when two K-1a class locomotives were built in its Angus shops in Montreal, the first locomotives to be built with a one-piece cast-steel frame in Canada. However, since the CPR mainlines were built to high standards, the railway preferred to develop the Hudson type for passenger work since it gave adequate power and was cheaper to maintain, while a ten-coupled type, the Selkirk, was adopted for heavy-duty work. Nevertheless, although the two CPR Northerns remained orphans, they proved their worth continuously for 25 years on overnight passenger trains between Montreal and Toronto. Before their retirement in 1960, they were converted to oil-burners and worked freight trains in the prairie provinces.

===Chile===
In 1936, the German builder Henschel &amp; Son supplied ten gauge locomotives to the (State Railways or FdE) of Chile, designated the . They were called (Super Mountains), since they followed the Mountain that was introduced six years earlier. They were equipped with mechanical stokers and Vanderbilt tenders and weighed 185 tonnes in working order. On test, they produced at a coal consumption of and a water consumption of per kilometre. The design was not repeated, however, and the FdE returned to the wheel arrangement with its subsequent acquisitions. The was used on the line from Almeda to Talca until it was replaced by diesels in 1969. One of them, no. 1009, is preserved in the Santiago Railway Museum.

===China===

In 1933, the Beijing–Hankou Railway in China needed new locomotives for their Guangzhou to Shaoguan line, where gradients of around two percent, curves with less than radius and low capacity bridges existed. The requirement was therefore for a locomotive with high tractive effort and a low axle load. In 1935 and 1936, 24 600-series locomotives, designed and built in the United Kingdom by Vulcan Foundry, were delivered to the railway. The locomotives represented a significant improvement over previous designs and incorporated a more efficient E-type superheater and duplex steam valve to allow better steaming without enlarging the boiler, while the wheel arrangement allowed better weight distribution.

When the Changsha–Guangzhou Railway was completed in October 1936, the locomotives were transferred to operate over the northern section between Hankou and Changsha on this new mainline, which connected Guangzhou with Tianjin and Beijing.

Following the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the locomotives were designated the China Railways KF class. Some of the locomotives survived in service until the early 1970s. One of them, no. 607, is preserved at the National Railway Museum in the United Kingdom and another is in China at the Beijing Railway Museum.

===Czechoslovakia===
The 60 T tank engines of Czechoslovak State Railways&#x27; 477 class represent the ultimate development of the CKD 4-8-2 tender locomotive, but added a four-wheel trailing truck as part of the conversion to a tank locomotive. One of five classes of three cylinder locomotives known, they were the last steam locomotives delivered to the Czechoslovak State Railways, with the last group built in 1955. Used primarily in local passenger service, they were pulling regularly timetabled trains as late as 1981. 

Three are preserved, as of 2018 two of them were still operational (013 and 043).

===France===
The lone prototype, numbered 242A1, of the (SNCF) was one of the five known classes of three-cylinder locomotives. It also had the distinction, along with an experimental high pressure locomotive of the New York Central Railroad in the United States, of being one of the two compound . It was rebuilt by Andre Chapelon from the unsuccessful 1932 three-cylinder simple expansion locomotive no. 241.101 of the into a compound locomotive. This remarkable locomotive achieved extraordinary power outputs and efficiency in coal and water consumption, but no further examples were built since the SNCF focused on electric traction for its future motive power development.
No. 242A1 was put through trials on many test runs which showed that this locomotive was equal in power output to the existing SNCF electric locomotives at the time. Here, for the first time in Europe, was a steam locomotive with a axle load which was not only at least as powerful as the most powerful existing high-speed electric locomotive, but which could repeatedly achieve its maximum power without any mechanical trouble. Developing and with of peak tractive effort and of mean tractive effort; nothing in Europe could match it.

While no. 242A1 was being tested, electrical engineers were designing the locomotives for the line between Paris and Lyon, which was to be electrified. An electric locomotive that was to be slightly more powerful than the successful Paris to Orléans 2-D-2 type electric locomotive was being contemplated. When the test results of no. 242A1 became known, however, the design was hurriedly changed to incorporate the maximum capacity possible with a axle load, resulting in the 9100 class with a power output of more than more than that of the original design.

The performances of the &quot;Mistral&quot; and other heavy passenger express trains would therefore not have been so outstanding if no. 242A1 had not existed and Andre Chapelon therefore indirectly influenced French electric locomotive design. In addition, no. 242A1 demonstrated the suitability of the Sauvage-Smith system of compounding for French conditions and the designs for future French steam locomotives that were prepared but never produced, were to make use of the Sauvage-Smith compounding system.

In service, no. 242A1 was allocated to the Le Mans depot and, between 1950 and 1960, it hauled express trains over the between Le Mans and Brest. It did not remain in service long, however, and was withdrawn and scrapped in 1960.

===Germany===
In 1939, the Deutsche Reichsbahn placed two prototype three-cylinder DRB Class 06 2D2-h3 heavy express locomotives in service, built by Krupp in 1938. Along with the lone 242A1 of the (SNCF) and the lone Victorian Railways H class in Australia, it was one of the five known classes of three-cylinder locomotives. Due to the outbreak of the Second World War and construction problems, only the two locomotives were produced.

With three cylinders, large diameter coupled wheels, a high boiler pressure and of tractive effort, they were capable of a maximum speed of and could haul a 650 tonne train at . Many parts, such as the boiler, were standardised with that of the DRG Class 45 heavy freight locomotive. The streamlined Class 06, the only German , was the biggest steam locomotive ever built in Germany. The two locomotives were shedded in Frankfurt and were placed in service on the line to Erfurt. No. 06.002 was bombed and destroyed during the hostilities and no. 06.001 survived until 1951, when it was retired and scrapped.

The boiler of both the 06 and 45 were designed along the lines of Robert Garbe and Richard Paul &quot;Kunibald&quot; Wagner, who held that a combustion chamber or double-expansion compound steam engines were unnecessary when using superheated steam. While the DB railways in the FRG salvaged the Class 45 design by fitting it with a badly-needed mechanical stoker, there was no need for the powerful Class 06 Express locos; when express traffic resumed, DB Class V 200 and DB Class E 10 Diesel-hydraulic and AC electric engines made any investment into pre-World War II steam engines unacceptable for the DB leadership even though Friedrich Witte or Adolph Giesl-Gieslingen proposed many improvements.

===Mexico===
In 1946, the (N de M) placed orders with American Locomotive Company and Baldwin Locomotive Works for sixty Niágara locomotives for use on its principal express passenger services on upgraded lines, but the order was reduced to 32 in favour of diesel-electric locomotives. These QR-1 class locomotives were used mainly on lines north of Mexico City and were nicknamed . All were taken out of service in the late 1960s. Most survived and No. 3028, although not in operating condition, was stored on the deadline at the New Hope and Ivyland Railroad in New Hope, Pennsylvania. 

===New Zealand===
New Zealand adopted the narrow gauge to minimise railway construction costs and, due to the mountainous terrain, the loading gauge was restricted to a maximum height of and width of , making it one of the most restrictive loading gauges in the world. While this undoubtedly reduced the cost of building the two hundred-odd tunnels on the railway system, it posed major problems for locomotive designers which were exacerbated by an axle load limit of .

After the Soviet Union and South Africa, the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) had the largest fleet of locomotives outside North America, with 71 similar locomotives in the K class, KA class and KB class.

The K class was designed by R.J. Gard to the requirements of Locomotive Superintendent P.R. Angus and was built locally at the Hutt Workshops of the NZR. The first locomotives were delivered during the depths of the Great Depression in 1932. The grate and comparatively large boiler was slung low on a narrow frame to keep within the height restrictions, and width restrictions were adhered to with sloped cab sides and the mounting of two single stage air compressors in front of the smokebox.
After the construction of thirty K class locomotives, the NZR developed the design to strengthen the frame and introduced other improvements, such as roller bearings on all axles and ACFI () feedwater heaters. Introduced from 1939, they were also built in NZR workshops, most of them with streamlined shrouding to cover the external pipe work of their feedwater heater systems. The first 35 locomotives were designated KA class and worked on the North Island mainlines with the older K class locomotives.

Six more were built, designated KB class, for service on the steeply graded Midland line on the South Island. These locomotives were equipped with trailing truck boosters, which raised their tractive effort by .

On occasion, these recorded speeds up to . The streamlining shrouds of the KA and KB classes were removed in the late 1940s when the ACFI feedwater heaters were replaced with exhaust steam injectors. The last of these locomotives was withdrawn in 1968 due to dieselisation. Seven have been preserved, K class numbers 900, 911 and 917, KA class numbers 935, 942 and 945 and KB class no. 968.

===South Africa===

Between 1953 and 1955, the South African Railways (SAR) placed fifty Class 25NC Northern locomotives in service. Designed under the direction of Chief Mechanical Engineer L.C. Grubb, eleven of these locomotives were built by North British Locomotive Company (NBL) and 39 by Henschel &amp; Son. They were tended by Type EW1 tenders which rode on six-wheeled bogies. Two versions of the same locomotive were built, the Class 25NC being the non-condensing version, hence the &quot;NC&quot; suffix to the class number.
Ninety Class 25 condensing locomotives were introduced simultaneously, acquired as a means to deal with the shortage of adequate supplies of suitable locomotive water in the arid Karoo. The design work on the engine&#x27;s condensing apparatus and the enormous condensing tender was carried out by Henschel, who built one locomotive complete with tender as well as sixty of the condensing tenders, to which they held the patent. The other 89 condensing locomotives and thirty tenders were built by NBL.
The Type CZ condensing tenders were slightly longer than their engines. One-third of the total length of the tender was taken up by the water tank and coal bunker, while the rest was taken up by eight large radiators on each side, cooled by five steam-driven roof-mounted fans. Roller bearings were used throughout on all these locomotives, including the coupling and connecting rods, the crosshead gudgeon pins as well as the three-axle bogies of both the standard and condensing tenders. The leading bogies and coupled wheels had Cannon-type axle boxes. The cylinders and frames were cast in one piece, while the steel cylinders and steam chests were fitted with cast iron liners. The tender frames of both locomotive types were also one-piece steel water-bottom castings. Since they were entirely mounted on roller bearings, very little effort was required to move these big locomotives.

On the condensing locomotives, spent steam was recycled and condensed back to water for repeated use. Since the steam was not expelled up the chimney, the smokebox contained a steam turbine-driven fan beneath the chimney to keep the draught going. Visual evidence of this altered and slightly longer smokebox is the locomotive&#x27;s banjo-face smokebox front. The condensing system proved extremely efficient and reduced water consumption by as much as 90% by using the same water up to eight times over, which gave the Class 25 a range of between water refills. In addition, the hot condensate feedwater resulted in significantly reduced coal consumption.
However, the Class 25 was a complex locomotive that required high maintenance, especially on the turbine blower fans in the smokebox, whose blades needed to be replaced frequently due to damage by solid particles in the exhaust. The equally complex condensing tender also required frequent maintenance. Between 1973 and 1980, partly motivated by the spread of electric and diesel-electric traction, all but three of the locomotives were converted to free-exhausting and non-condensing locomotives and reclassified to Class 25NC. In the process their condensing tenders were also rebuilt to ordinary coal-and-water tenders by removing the condensing radiators and roof fans and replacing it with a massive round-topped water tank. Since the tenders were built on single cast-steel main frames, it was impractical to attempt to shorten them. Locomotives with these rebuilt Type EW2 tenders were soon nicknamed (Sausage dog or Dachshund).
The Class 26, popularly known as the &quot;Red Devil&quot;, was rebuilt from Henschel-built Class 25NC no. 3450 by mechanical engineer David Wardale. The rebuilding took place at the Salt River shops of the SAR in Cape Town and was based on the principles developed by Argentinian mechanical engineer Livio Dante Porta. The primary objectives of the modifications were to improve the combustion and steaming rate to reduce the emission of wasteful black smoke and to overcome the problem of clinkering. This was achieved by the use of a Gas Producer Combustion System (GPCS), which relies on the gasification of coal on a low temperature firebed so that the gases are then fully burnt above the firebed. The GPCS minimises the amount of air being drawn up through the firebed, the main source of air required for combustion being through ancillary air intakes on the firebox sides above the firebed.

The modified locomotive became the only Class 26. Compared to an unmodified Class 25NC, the &quot;Red Devil&quot; achieved a 28% measured saving on coal and a 30% measured saving on water, measured during freight service, and a 43% increase in drawbar power based on the maximum recorded drawbar power. Its approximate maximum range in full load freight service on 1% to % grades was based on its coal capacity, and based on its water capacity. The maximum recorded freight load hauled relative to gradient was on 2% grades, and it could haul a passenger train at a constant speed of on 1% grades. The &quot;Red Devil&quot; great power, however, also turned out to be its one weakness. The Class 25NC had already proven to be on the slippery side and the much more powerful Class 26, with essentially still the same dimensions as the Class 25NC, was even worse. It was a poor performer at starting or at low speeds on steep gradients.

===Soviet Union===
Outside North America, the largest fleet of locomotives was the Class P36 of the (SZhD) or Soviet Railways, of which 251 were built by the Kolomna locomotive works between 1949 and 1956. As the last Soviet standard class steam locomotive, the Class P36 shared some common components and design attributes with earlier standard Soviet designs such as the L class Decapod type and LV class Santa Fe type, as well as some common attributes with the P34 class  Mallet and P38 class Yellowstone type Mallet. For example, the P36 and LV classes shared the same feedwater heater, made by the Bryansk machine factory. Apart from a trio of fully streamlined Baltic-type locomotives, they were the only semi-streamlined steam locomotives built in Russia. 
The Class P36 was one of the best passenger steam locomotive classes built in the Soviet Union. They had boilers with of heating surface that had a working boiler pressure of . Russian-designed roller bearings were fitted throughout and the boilers were designed to provide a continuous steaming capacity of per of heating surface in the boiler. With its cylinders and diameter coupled wheels, it could easily attain speeds up to with passenger trains of up to .

The Class P36 first appeared on the &quot;Oktyabrskaya Railway&quot; (October Railway) to haul principal express trains between Moscow and Leningrad, but they did not remain on this mainline long. Diesels took over after only a few years and the P36 class locomotives were transferred to other lines and depots, such as the Moscow–Kursk and Moscow–Ryazan lines, Kalinin, Krasnoyarsk, Belarusian Railway, Melitopol depot, Kuibyshev and Alexandrov depot. 

Later, when electrification and dieselisation expanded, many of the Class P36 locomotives were transferred to work on the Lviv, Far East, Eastern Siberia, and Transbaikal Railways. The last was withdrawn from regular scheduled express passenger train service in 1974. All were staged in full working order and kept in reserve for times of extraordinary demand. At certain intervals, the locomotives were taken out from staging, steamed up and put to work to haul trains to test the condition of the locomotives. In the late 1980s, these strategic reserves of locomotives were disbanded and the Class P36 locomotives were distributed to museums and for preservation. Some that had not seen regular use for more than fifteen years and were in the worst mechanical condition, were scrapped. It was found that the roller bearings suffered most by standing unused. When the computerised new class numbers were introduced by the Russian Ministry of Railways, the Class P36 were designated Class 1000.0001 to 1000.0251. In the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, a number were sold to private train operators. 

===Spain===
The 242F class express passenger locomotives were designed by the Red Nacional de los Ferrocarriles Españoles (RENFE) in 1955 and were remarkably well-proportioned. Developed from a preceding Mountain type, they had improved steam passages and developed 30 to 40 per cent more power at medium cut-offs and high speed. Ten of these locomotives were built by in Barcelona to burn fuel oil. They had Witte type smoke deflectors and were fitted with a double KylChap (Kylälä-Chapelon) blast-pipe, a Worthington feedwater heater and a (TIA) water-softening device. To increase the comfort of the locomotive crew, the cabs had wooden floors mounted on springs, and the seats of the driver and fireman were also sprung, a very welcome improvement for long runs on poor tracks. These locomotives were painted in a green livery when turned out from the builder&#x27;s works at Barcelona and were consequently nicknamed (The Greens). 
The 242F class was the fastest Spanish steam locomotive. When tested on the line from Barcelona to Tarragona across of practically level and straight line between Vilanova i la Geltrú and Sant Vicent, a speed exceeding was sustained twice, first with a train of 430 tons and then with a train of 480 tons. High-capacity tests took place between Madrid and Ávila when a train weighing 426 tons, including a dynamometer car, was hauled at sustained speeds of up a gradient of (1 in 286), up a gradient of (1 in 95) and up a gradient of (1 in 44.5). The gross horsepower figures recorded with the dynamometer car were 1790, 2350 and 2320 respectively, the calculated horsepower on the rail being 2600, 3400 and 3580. The latter output translates to about .

With these locomotives, there was some concern about water supply. The capacity of the tender was limited at only and, with few watering points in service, the full capacity of the locomotive was not always used for fear of running short of this essential commodity in the semi-arid Spanish landscape. For example, for the stretch between Medina del Campo and Burgos that rises with an uphill start, three intermediate stops, one slack and some shunting movements to couple extra coaches to the train, the amount of water consumed was about .

All ten locomotives were allocated to the Miranda de Ebro shed to haul principal heavy express trains. In the 1960s, they were a familiar sight at the head of the premier express trains, but in 1971 they were transferred entirely to semi-fast passenger trains and even to the haulage of heavy seasonal fruit trains between Castejón and Alsasua from October to January. One locomotive, no. 242F.2009, is preserved at the Madrid Railway Museum.

===United Kingdom===
In 1938 William Stanier considered a 4-6-4 express passenger locomotive design, together with a 4-8-4 version as a large mixed-traffic locomotive. War intervened and suspended development of express passenger locomotives, but the 4-8-4 design was re-examined in 1942 by Fairburn, the acting CME, as a possible post-war type for fast fitted freights.

While no steam locomotives were known to be this type, an experimental diesel-mechanical locomotive, the British Rail 10100, had this wheel arrangement, but it was scrapped after a gearbox failure caused a loss of interest in the project.

===United States===

The American was a heavy locomotive, with nearly all examples in the United States having axle loads of more than . On railroads with rail of , axle loads of more than were permitted. Exceptionally heavy 4-8-4s were therefore introduced on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe (Santa Fe), Chicago and North Western (CNW), Chesapeake and Ohio (C&amp;O), Milwaukee Road (MILW), Northern Pacific (NP), Norfolk and Western (N&amp;W), Spokane, Portland and Seattle (SP&amp;S) and Western Maryland (WM) railroads. The Santa Fe Class 2900 had the heaviest axle load of all at as well as being the heaviest 4-8-4s ever built, weighing total. The lightest 4-8-4s in the United States were the six H-10 class locomotives of the Toledo, Peoria and Western (TPW), with an axle load of .

Some 4-8-4s were used on exceptionally long runs.
* The Santa Fe Heavy Mountains were rostered to haul the &quot;Chief&quot; and &quot;Fast Mail&quot; trains between La Junta, Colorado and Los Angeles across , and also handled the &quot;Grand Canyon Limited&quot; between Los Angeles and Wellington, Kansas, across . From 1942, they ran through from Los Angeles to Kansas City via the Belen Cutoff and Amarillo, Texas, a distance of , setting a new record for through steam locomotive rosters.
* The Niagaras of the New York Central Railroad (NYC) also accomplished long runs on New York to Chicago passenger trains, including the &quot;Chicagoan&quot; and the &quot;Commodore Vanderbilt&quot;.
* The Northern Pacific hauled the &quot;North Coast Limited&quot; across from St. Paul, Minnesota, to Livingston, Montana.
* The Great Northern S-2 Class of 4-8-4s hauled the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; across from St. Paul, Minnesota to Wenatchee, Washington and possibly as far west to Seattle, a maximum distance of .

Several of the earlier locomotive models were modified or rebuilt during their service lives.
* Santa Fe developed their 4-8-4s for years, and named the classes based on the number of the first locomotive in the class. The fourteen 3751 class locomotives that were introduced in 1927 and 1928 were of conservative design, with diameter driving wheels and a boiler pressure of . In 1938, these locomotives were rebuilt with more modern features, including new diameter Boxpok driving wheels, increased size steam passages to and from the cylinders, the boiler pressure raised to and roller bearings on all engine axles. This gave them a maximum drawbar power of at . Engine no. 3752 was equipped with Franklin rotary cam poppet valve gear and achieved the very low steam rate of 13.5 lb per indicated horsepower-hour (2.28 mg/J). These locomotives were permitted to run at , but they were alleged to have exceeded several times.
* The heavy Class H Northerns of the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad were rebuilt in 1940 with lightweight rods, Boxpok driving wheels and roller bearings on all axles, and the boiler pressure was raised from . Some years later, 24 of them underwent another rebuild which included new nickel-steel frames, new cylinders, pilot beams and air reservoirs, new fireboxes and other minor improvements. These were reclassified as Class H-1.
* The S-2 Class Northerns of the Great Northern Railway were rebuilt to have Timken roller bearings on every axle in 1945, replacing their original plain bearings. Vestibule cabs were added to engine 2577 in the early 1930s and engines 2582, 2586, 2587 and 2588 by the late 1940s.

Some Northern locomotives were also rebuilt from older engines. Between 1945 and 1947, the Reading Railroad rebuilt thirty of their heavy I-10 class Consolidations to booster-fitted Northern locomotives with diameter driving wheels. An additional ring was added at the smokebox end of the boiler, which increased the length of the boiler tubes from to , and a larger smokebox was installed which increased the distance between the tube plate and the chimney centre line from to . Steam pressure was raised from . Four syphons were fitted, three in the firebox proper and one in the combustion chamber. A twelve-wheeled tender was attached, weighing 167 tons in working order, with a capacity of 23.5 tons of coal and of water. A new cast-steel frame was used, with the cylinders cast integral and roller bearings on all axles. They were reclassified to T1 and numbered 2100 to 2129. Two of these locomotives, preserved for hauling special trains, were still in use in 1963.
The Northerns were workhorses that went without much public recognition, with a few exceptions. The Class GS-4 &quot;Golden State&quot; locomotives of Southern Pacific (SP), of which 36 were built by Lima Locomotive Works in 1941 and 1942, were semi-streamlined and were given a striking livery with a broad orange valence over the wheels below a narrow red band that came halfway up the cab windows. The locomotives headed the &quot;Coast Daylight&quot; train on the railroad&#x27;s Coast Line between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The television program &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; was introduced with a shot of an SP GS-4 as the announcer declared that Superman was &quot;more powerful than a locomotive.&quot; One of them, Southern Pacific 4449, has been restored and is in operating condition.

Even after the demise of steam, the Northern type has been in the spotlight of publicity and, along with Union Pacific 844 of the Union Pacific FEF Series and Norfolk and Western 611 of the Norfolk and Western Class J series, among other Northerns, have been the favoured type to provide mainline excursions in the United States. The former is the only steam locomotive of a Class I railroad never to have been retired.

==North American production list==
Most North American s were built by ALCO, Lima and the Baldwin Locomotive Works, while Canadian National Railway&#x27;s fleet was built by Montreal Locomotive Works. Only the Canadian Pacific Railway, the Norfolk and Western Railway, the St. Louis Southwestern Railway (Cotton Belt) and the Reading Railroad built or rebuilt their own. The Missouri Pacific rebuilt one class of their s from their class BK-63 2-8-4s.

The Northern type was used by 37 railroads in the Americas, including 31 railroads in the United States, three in Canada, one in Mexico and two in Brazil. In all, there were fewer than 1,200 locomotives of this type in North America, compared to the approximately 2,500 Mountain types and 6,800 Pacific types. By far the largest fleet was owned by the CN and its subsidiary, the Grand Trunk Western Railroad, with altogether 203 locomotives.

==Preservation by country==
In many countries, the was a late development of the steam locomotive, close to the time of steam&#x27;s demise. Many more were therefore preserved than other older wheel arrangements, either plinthed or in museums, with several being kept in running condition. Some of the more notable preserved Northerns worldwide are listed here by country of origin.

<doc id="425770" wikidata="Q7888076" url="?curid=425770" title="United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1982">
<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1982 with the song &quot;One Step Further&quot;, written by Simon Jefferis, and performed by the band Bardo. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final. In addition, the BBC was also the host broadcaster and staged the event at the Harrogate International Centre in Harrogate, after winning the with the song &quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot; by Bucks Fizz.

==Before Eurovision==
===&quot;A Song for Europe 1982&quot;===
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) used once again the television show &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; to select its entry, as it had since its debut at the contest in 1957. Terry Wogan once again hosted the contest, which was held on 24 March at Studio 1 of the BBC Television Centre in London. Eight songs were shortlisted from those submitted to the Music Publishers Association. Bucks Fizz were guests at the show, singing their current single &quot;My Camera Never Lies&quot; in a pre-recorded performance. The group were interviewed by Terry Wogan live during the show and group member Bobby G performed backing vocals for the winning artists, Bardo. The BBC Concert Orchestra under the direction of Ronnie Hazlehurst as conductor accompanied all the songs, but despite performing live, the orchestra were off-screen, behind the set. The set itself gave a suggestion as to the main Eurovision stage in Harrogate which also used light columns and mirrors, in addition this set was partially recycled for the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; adventure &quot;Snakedance&quot;, broadcast almost a year later.

Paul Curtis planned to perform two of his three entries himself and recorded the two tracks for his forthcoming album. &quot;Different Worlds, Different People&quot; was to be performed by Curtis with a backing trio, but he opted not to sing the song himself due to the running order, and Bobby McVay sang the song in the competition with Samantha Spencer Lane and two other singers under the group name Lovin&#x27; Feeling. McVay returned to win the contest the following year as a member of Sweet Dreams. Curtis returned on several more occasions as a songwriter, winning the contest in 1984, 1990 and 1991. Curtis&#x27; third song was performed by family group The Weltons, who were the only act taking part in the 1982 final that had any prior performing or recording experience, having released several singles, including &quot;Down at Shorty&#x27;s Place&quot;, &quot;Hang 10, Hang10&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roller&quot;, although none of them had reached the UK singles chart, but they had been promoted on German television and radio. The quartet &#x27;Good Looks&#x27; featured Lewis and Lavinia Rodgers, the brother and sister of former UK Eurovision entrant Clodagh Rodgers. Although formed for the competition to sing Dave Mindel&#x27;s &quot;Every Day of My Life&quot;, the group stayed together and recorded the closing theme song for &quot;Jim&#x27;ll Fix It&quot;, also composed by Mindel. On one edition of that show, the group performed the song with a viewer who&#x27;d asked Jim to fix it for him to sing the song.

Bardo&#x27;s victory meant that Sally-Ann Triplett became only the third singer to win the Song for Europe contest twice, having already won the 1980 contest as part of Prima Donna. (Cliff Richard had represented the UK twice in Eurovision, but did not participate in a contest to determine the British artist). Triplett remains the only artist to have participated multiple times to win the contest at all attempts.

The regional juries voted internally and awarded 15 points to their favourite song, 12 points to the second, 10 points to the third and then 9, 8, 7, 6 and 5 points in order of preference for the songs from 4th to 8th. The juries were based in Glasgow, Birmingham, Bristol, Belfast, London, Manchester and Cardiff.

<doc id="425771" wikidata="Q4362" url="?curid=425771" title="Social Democratic Party of Lithuania">
<text>The Social Democratic Party of Lithuania (, LSDP) is a centre-left and social democratic political party in Lithuania. Founded as an underground Marxist organisation in 1896, it is the oldest extant party in Lithuania. During the time of the Soviet Union, the party went into exile, emerging once again after the end of communist rule in 1989.

The party led a government in the unicameral Seimas, Lithuania&#x27;s parliament from 2001 to 2008 and from 2012 to 2016. It has been the ruling party of Lithuania since 2024. The party is a member of the Party of European Socialists (PES), Progressive Alliance, and Socialist International.

==History==
===Establishment===
Initial discussions about forming a Marxist political party in Lithuania began early in 1895, with a number of informal gatherings bringing together social democrats of various stripes resulting in a preparatory conference in the summer of that year. Differences in objectives became clear between ethnic Jews and ethnic Lithuanians and Poles, with the former seeing themselves essentially as Russian Marxists while the latter two groups harboured both revolutionary and national aspirations. Moreover, the ethnic Poles and Lithuanians saw themselves divided over the question of alliance with non-Marxist liberals. As a result, not one but three Marxist political organisations would emerge in Lithuania between 1895 and 1897.

The Social Democratic Party of Lithuania (LSDP) was founded on 1 May 1896 at a secret congress held in an apartment in Vilnius. Among the 13 delegates were Andrius Domaševičius and Alfonsas Moravskis—a pair of intellectuals regarded as the central organisers of the new political entity—and the future President of Lithuania, Kazys Grinius, as well as a number of worker activists. Also in attendance as a representative of the radical youth movement was an 18-year-old ethnic Pole named Felix Dzerzhinsky, later the head of the Soviet secret police. As Lithuania was then part of the Russian Empire, the LSDP was inevitably an illegal organisation, meeting in secret and seeking to bring about the revolutionary overthrow of the Tsarist regime.

The LSDP was a dual language organisation, publishing its illegal newspapers both in Lithuanian and Polish. Newspapers were published abroad, printed in East Prussia (or sometimes Switzerland or France) and smuggled across the border. Technical assistance was occasionally provided by the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania party, headed by Julian Marchlewski.

This smuggling of Lithuanian newspapers had historical antecedents. Following the Polish and Lithuanian Uprising of 1863, the Tsarist regime had banned publication of all newspapers which used the Latin alphabet, a measure which amounted to a &quot;de facto&quot; ban of the entire Lithuanian press. This proscription extended for the rest of the 19th Century; in 1898 of 18 newspapers appearing in Lithuanian, 11 were published by Lithuanians in emigration in America and the other 7 were published in East Prussia.

The LSDP was very nearly obliterated at birth by the Okhrana, which over the course of 1897 to 1899 managed to arrest a number of the party&#x27;s leading activists. Approximately 280 socialist and trade union organisers were apprehended during this period, with subsequent trials leading to the Siberian exile of more than 40 people, including Domaševičius and Dzerzhinsky. Other top leaders, including Moravskis, were forced to flee the country to avoid being swept up in the Okhrana&#x27;s dragnet. With the party leadership jailed or chased from the country, the LSDP very nearly ceased to exist as the 19th century drew to a close.

===Resurgence===
From 1900 to 1902, the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania began to tentatively rise from the ashes behind a new crop of young revolutionaries. Chief among these were a pair of Lithuanian students in Vilnius, Vladas Sirutavičius and Steponas Kairys.

It was the first Lithuanian political party and one of the major parties who initiated the assembly called Great Seimas of Vilnius in 1905. The party was one of the major political powers during the Lithuanian independence period between 1918 and 1940. Following the election of 1926, the party formed a left-wing coalition government with Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union. This government was dismissed after the 1926 Lithuanian coup d&#x27;état. The authoritarian regime of Antanas Smetona banned all political parties in 1936.

===Period of Soviet occupation===
During the Soviet occupation era, no democratically constituted political parties existed within Lithuania. Therefore, between 1945 and the 1989 restoration of independence, the party was assembled and worked covertly in exile.

===1989–2001===
In 1989, the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania was restored. Kazimieras Antanavičius was elected to be party&#x27;s leader. The party had 9 seats in the Supreme Council – Reconstituent Seimas and was not successful in substantially increasing the number in the following elections, with 8 seats won in 1992 and 12 in 1996.

In 1999, the party&#x27;s congress elected a new leader, Vytenis Andriukaitis and merger negotiations with the Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (LDDP)–the bulk of the former Communist Party of Lithuania (which had broken away from Moscow in 1989) began. Members of the party opposing the merger left to establish &quot;Social democracy 2000&quot; (later renamed &quot;Social Democratic Union of Lithuania&quot;). The SDPL-LDDP coalition won 51 of the 141 seats in the elections in 2000 (with 19 going to the Social Democrats). However, despite success in the elections, the coalition parties had to settle for a place in the opposition until 2001, when the collapse of the ruling coalition between Liberals and New Union allowed ex-President Algirdas Brazauskas to form a government with New Union.

=== Since 2001 ===

In 2001, the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania and the Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania merged. The merged party kept the Social Democratic name, but was dominated by former Democratic Labour Party members (ex-Communists). After the merger, Algirdas Brazauskas was elected leader of the Social Democratic Party.

By the beginning of 2004, negotiations between the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania and various other parties to form electoral coalition. They managed to form electoral coalition called &quot;Working for Lithuania&quot; with their coalition partners, New Union. At the 2004 legislative elections, the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania won 20 of the 141 seats in the Seimas (other 11 seats were won by the New Union), but managed to stay at the helm of successive coalition governments, including the minority government between 2006 and 2008. During the minority government, party&#x27;s parliamentary group became the largest one in parliament, mainly due to defections from the Labour Party and the New Union (Social Liberals).

Brazauskas resigned as the chairman of the party on 19 May 2007 and was replaced by Gediminas Kirkilas.

At the 2008 elections, the party won 11.73% of the national vote and 25 seats in the Seimas, five more than in the previous elections. However, its coalition partners, the Labour Party, the New Union (Social Liberals) and the Lithuanian Peasants Popular Union, fared poorly and the party ended up in opposition to the Homeland Union-led government.

On 7 March 2009, the party&#x27;s congress elected a new leader, Algirdas Butkevičius. He was the party&#x27;s candidate at the 2009 Lithuanian presidential election, coming in second place with 11.83% of the vote.

At the 2012 parliamentary elections, the party took 38 seats and became the largest party in Parliament (although it lost in popular vote). Butkevičius became the prime minister, forming a coalition government with the Labour Party, Order and Justice and Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance. At the 2016 parliamentary elections, the party took 21 seats and formed a coalition with Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union.

In 2017, the Social Democratic Party withdraw from coalition. In 2018, some party members left and formed the Social Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania. After this split, the party lost a lot of support, but in 2019 it partly recovered.

At the 2020 parliamentary elections, the party achieved worse results than expected. Due to this, Gintautas Paluckas received criticism from party&#x27;s board and resigned in 2021. After a leadership election, Vilija Blinkevičiūtė (between 2002 and 2006 she was New Union (Social Liberals) member) was elected as the new leader. After election of Blinkevičiūtė, the party&#x27;s support nearly doubled thanks to her personal popularity.

In the 2024 parliamentary elections, the party achieved a &quot;historic victory&quot;, finishing in first place with 19.32% of the popular vote and 52 out of 141 seats. While party chair Vilija Blinkevičiūtė had expressed her willingness to serve as prime minister during the campaign, she declined the role after the election, leading instead to the nomination of deputy chair Gintautas Paluckas. This unexpected change in leadership was criticized by the LSDP&#x27;s potential coalition partners.

After the election, further controversy arose when the Social Democrats invited the newly created populist party Dawn of Nemunas to join the ruling coalition, along with the Union of Democrats &quot;For Lithuania&quot;. The founder of Dawn of Nemunas, Remigijus Žemaitaitis, is known for making antisemitic statements, and his party&#x27;s inclusion sparked backlash from Lithuanian civil society groups, as well as from lawmakers and ambassadors abroad, including US Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair Ben Cardin, German MPs Roderich Kiesewetter and Michael Roth, Polish senator Michał Kamiński, and the Israeli embassy. Roth, the chair of the Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee, urged the LSDP to reconsider their choice and claimed that it would threaten LSDP&#x27;s membership in the Party of European Socialists. However, no official PES condemnation of the coalition was issued, and the European party congratulated the Social Democrats with the formation of the Paluckas Cabinet on December 12.

==Ideology and platform==
LSDP is generally described as a centre-left party. Historically, the party was criticized for lacking commitment to social democracy. According to political scientist , &quot;before their split, the Social Democrats never managed to be a left-wing party. Although they said they were, their policies were right-wing, even the vocabulary was closer to the right.&quot; During the Eleventh Seimas from 2012 to 2016, when the party played a leading role in the Butkevičius Cabinet, it was criticized by left-wing intellectuals such as Andrius Bielskis and Arkadijus Vinokuras for lacking allegiance to left-wing ideas and for its neoliberal policies, such as reforms to the Labour Code in 2016 which strengthened the position of employers in workplace relations.

In 2017, after Gintautas Paluckas was elected as the party&#x27;s chairman, LSDP declared a renewal of its ideology and values, reforming closer to a Western social democratic party. It introduced a new program, in which it affirmed commitment to progressive taxation, encouragement of worker cooperatives, women&#x27;s rights and LGBT rights, and support for NATO and the European Union, while at the same time opposing European austerity policies. Several of the party&#x27;s former leaders and members of the Seimas left the party in 2017 and 2018, including two former Prime Ministers, Gediminas Kirkilas and Algirdas Butkevičius. Most of them then established the Social Democratic Labour Party, later renamed to the Lithuanian Regions Party. However, this renewal was also criticized as incomplete and straddling the fence between progressiveness and the party&#x27;s previous non-ideological populism.

After Paluckas&#x27; resignation, Vilija Blinkevičiūtė was elected as LSDP&#x27;s new chairman. The party&#x27;s program was retained, and conservative former party members such as Artūras Skardžius were not accepted back into the party. However, the party has since focused most on criticism of the Homeland Union and progressive economic proposals over social justice and social reforms. 5 of 13 of the party&#x27;s members of the Seimas voted against a proposed same-sex partnership law in 2021, even though the party&#x27;s program was in favor of same-sex partnerships. The Left Alliance was founded in 2022 in response to the Social Democrats&#x27; alleged betrayal of left-wing values.

The party supports lowering voting age to 16 in local elections.

== Popular support ==
In early 1990s, the party had between 3 and 5 per cent support nationally. It got most support from areas with light industry (e. g. Marijampolė, Vilkaviškis, Miklusėnai). By the end of decade, LSDP increased their support in Radviliškis District Municipality (probably, at expense of Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (LDDP)).

After merger of these two parties, LSDP gained support from most supporters of LDDP. In early 2010s, the party lost support due to deindustrialisation, rise of public election committees and Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union (e. g. in Kaunas, by 2011, got over 12 per cent of votes; however, in 2019, the party received just over 3 per cent of the votes).

<text>John Antoine Nau (1860–1918), real name Eugène Léon Édouard Torquet, was a French poet and writer most famous for his novel &quot;Enemy Force&quot;, which won the first Prix Goncourt in 1903.

==Life==
He was born on November 19, 1860, in San Francisco, California and was thus an American citizen. His father, an engineer and businessman, had emigrated from France to California about 1845 and become a naturalized citizen. Attacked by typhus, he died in 1864, leaving a widow and three children. In 1866 they returned to France, first to Le Havre and then to Paris. In 1881 at the age of 21 years Nau boarded a three-master doing business in Haiti and the West Indies as a pilot&#x27;s assistant. Later he became Assistant Commissioner and traveled to Colombia, Venezuela and New York.

He returned to France during 1883 and married in 1885. For their honeymoon Nau and his bride went to Martinique, planning to stay, but family obligations forced them to return to France. Nau would never return to Martinique. In 1886, he lived in San Raphaél; 1887 in Piriac; then elsewhere. While living in Carteret in La Manche he wrote his first book of poetry, &quot;Au seuil de l&#x27;espoir&quot; (On the Threshold of Hope), which he published in 1897 at his own expense. He was 37 years old. Then to Majorca in 1898, to Tenerife in the Canaries. In Puerto de la Orotava he began his novel, finished in Andalusia. Between 1903 and 1906 he settled in Saint Tropez. In 1903, again at his own expense, he published &quot;Enemy Force&quot;. It was a commercial failure, and was not even reviewed because the author did not send it to the critics. But he never wrote to make a living; he wrote only for his own pleasure. He relocated to Algers, then to Corsica for seven years (his record). The war caused him to return to Paris from 1916 to 1917, then to Tréboul in Brittany, where he died on March 17, 1918, at the age of 57 years.

In 1903, age 43, he was awarded the first Prix Goncourt for &quot;Enemy Force&quot;, his first novel. It tells the story of Phillipe Veuly, a poet, who awakens in an insane asylum. He does not know how he got there or why, but learns this in time. He becomes enamored of a female inmate who eventually leaves, he becomes inhabited by a being from another planet, is tortured by the &#x27;doctors&#x27; of the establishment, escapes and travels the world in search of the female ex-patient. Darkly humorous and satirical, it is considered by many to be a forgotten masterpiece of science fiction.

It is said that he was called Gino by family and friends and thus his name—pronounced the same as J. Nau in French; and that it is a mixture of his American birth (John) and French heritage (Antoine); and that Nau means &#x27;vessel&#x27; in Catalan, showing his love for the sea; and that it is in homage to the Haitian poet Ignace Nau; or all or none of the above.

Many of his works remained unedited at his death and are unpublished as of 2011.

==Prix Goncourt==
In 1903 a group writers gathered in Paris (J. K. Huysmans, Octave Mirbeau, Léon Daudet, the brothers Rosny, Paul Marguerite, Lucien Desclaves, Élémir Bourges, Léon Hennique, Gustave Geffroy) and awarded &quot;Enemy Force&quot; the first Prix Goncourt (by a vote of 6 to 4). Edmond de Goncourt had stipulated in his will that they would award a prose work of imagination to distinguish and support a young literary debut full of promise. He rested in peace that first year. Nau was 43 years old. The author was almost completely unknown, except for a very few exotic stories in &quot;La Revue Blanche&quot;. He was living in Saint Tropez at the time and didn&#x27;t even return to Paris to claim his prize money. His &quot;outsider&quot; status irked many a critic, but it only increased his status among the jury and other, younger writers. In 1906 Paul Léautaud: &quot;The Prix Goncourt has really only been given once—the first time to Nau&quot;. And years later Huysmans would say, &quot;It was the best one that we ever crowned.&quot;

<doc id="425779" wikidata="Q2712821" url="?curid=425779" title="Compression (physics)">
<text>In mechanics, compression is the application of balanced inward (&quot;pushing&quot;) forces to different points on a material or structure, that is, forces with no net sum or torque directed so as to reduce its size in one or more directions. It is contrasted with tension or traction, the application of balanced outward (&quot;pulling&quot;) forces; and with shearing forces, directed so as to displace layers of the material parallel to each other. The compressive strength of materials and structures is an important engineering consideration.

In uniaxial compression, the forces are directed along one direction only, so that they act towards decreasing the object&#x27;s length along that direction. The compressive forces may also be applied in multiple directions; for example inwards along the edges of a plate or all over the side surface of a cylinder, so as to reduce its area (biaxial compression), or inwards over the entire surface of a body, so as to reduce its volume.

Technically, a material is under a state of compression, at some specific point and along a specific direction formula_1, if the normal component of the stress vector across a surface with normal direction formula_1 is directed opposite to formula_1. If the stress vector itself is opposite to formula_1, the material is said to be under normal compression or pure compressive stress along formula_1. In a solid, the amount of compression generally depends on the direction formula_1, and the material may be under compression along some directions but under traction along others. If the stress vector is purely compressive and has the same magnitude for all directions, the material is said to be under isotropic compression, hydrostatic compression, or bulk compression. This is the only type of static compression that liquids and gases can bear. It affects the volume of the material, as quantified by the bulk modulus and the volumetric strain.

The inverse process of compression is called &quot;decompression&quot;, &quot;dilation&quot;, or &quot;expansion&quot;, in which the object enlarges or increases in volume.

In a mechanical wave, which is longitudinal, the medium is displaced in the wave&#x27;s direction, resulting in areas of compression and rarefaction.

== Effects ==
When put under compression (or any other type of stress), every material will suffer some deformation, even if imperceptible, that causes the average relative positions of its atoms and molecules to change. The deformation may be permanent, or may be reversed when the compression forces disappear. In the latter case, the deformation gives rise to reaction forces that oppose the compression forces, and may eventually balance them.

Liquids and gases cannot bear steady uniaxial or biaxial compression, they will deform promptly and permanently and will not offer any permanent reaction force. However they can bear isotropic compression, and may be compressed in other ways momentarily, for instance in a sound wave.
Every ordinary material will contract in volume when put under isotropic compression, contract in cross-section area when put under uniform biaxial compression, and contract in length when put into uniaxial compression. The deformation may not be uniform and may not be aligned with the compression forces. What happens in the directions where there is no compression depends on the material. Most materials will expand in those directions, but some special materials will remain unchanged or even contract. In general, the relation between the stress applied to a material and the resulting deformation is a central topic of continuum mechanics.

== Uses ==
Compression of solids has many implications in materials science, physics and structural engineering, for compression yields noticeable amounts of stress and tension.

By inducing compression, mechanical properties such as compressive strength or modulus of elasticity, can be measured.

Compression machines range from very small table top systems to ones with over 53 MN capacity.

Gases are often stored and shipped in highly compressed form, to save space. Slightly compressed air or other gases are also used to fill balloons, rubber boats, and other inflatable structures. Compressed liquids are used in hydraulic equipment and in fracking.

== In engines ==

=== Internal combustion engines ===
In internal combustion engines the explosive mixture gets compressed before it is ignited; the compression improves the efficiency of the engine. In the Otto cycle, for instance, the second stroke of the piston effects the compression of the charge which has been drawn into the cylinder by the first forward stroke.

=== Steam engines ===
The term is applied to the arrangement by which the exhaust valve of a steam engine is made to close, shutting a portion of the exhaust steam in the cylinder, before the stroke of the piston is quite complete. This steam being compressed as the stroke is completed, a cushion is formed against which the piston does work while its velocity is being rapidly reduced, and thus the stresses in the mechanism due to the inertia of the reciprocating parts are lessened. This compression, moreover, obviates the shock which would otherwise be caused by the admission of the fresh steam for the return stroke.

<text>The Liberal Union of Lithuania () was a liberal political party in Lithuania.

==History==
The party was founded on the 25th of November, 1990 on a basis of the Vilnius University Liberal Club. Its first leader was Vilnius University philosophy professor Vytautas Radžvilas. In the 1992 parliamentary election, the Liberal Union got 1.51 percent of votes and failed to win any seats. In January 1993 the party congress agreed upon declaration, which stated that the party would position itself on the right. In 1994 the party&#x27;s membership grew. Most of these new members were either former politicians (e. g. former Moderates Movement&#x27;s leader Eugenijus Gentvilas) or employees of the infamous investment company.

In the 1995 municipal election, the party got 2.69 percent of the votes nationally and 40 councillors. Most of these gains were city districts (e. g. Birštonas, Marijampolė, Klaipėda). After these elections many members of Liberal Union in Kaunas resigned. In 1996 parliamentary election the party received 1.84 percent of the votes and one mandate. In 1997 municipal election, the party won 3.99 percent of the votes. As a result, the Liberal Union managed to form coalitions with other parties and win mayorships (most notably, in Klaipėda).

Party&#x27;s breakthrough came in late 1999, when former Prime Minister of Lithuania (and Homeland Union member) Rolandas Paksas became party&#x27;s leader. In 2000 municipal election the Liberal Union won 13.99 percent of the votes (first place was won by the New Union (Social Liberals) with 16.68 percent of the votes) and mayorships in three major cities, Vilnius, Kaunas and Klaipėda. In the parliamentary election of the same year, the party won 17.25 percent of the votes and 34 seats in Seimas. By this, the Liberal Union was the largest single party in Seimas for four months in 2000 and 2001.

After these elections, the Liberal Union formed a coalition with the New Union (Social Liberals), the Lithuanian Centre Union, the Modern Christian Democrats and the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania (with support from the Lithuanian Peasants Party). This coalition lasted for seven months, when New Union (Social Liberals) withdraw their government ministers.

After this, the party joined the opposition. By December 2001, Rolandas Paksas (and some of his followers) left the Liberal Union and founded the Liberal Democratic Party. Along this split, the party started negotiations with former coalition partners, the Lithuanian Centre Union and the Modern Christian Democrats, about merger. All three parties merged into Liberal and Centre Union in 2003.

<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1983 with the song &quot;I&#x27;m Never Giving Up&quot;, written by Ron Roker, Phil Wigger, and Jan Pulsford, and performed by the band Sweet Dreams. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final.

==Before Eurovision==
=== &quot;A Song for Europe 1983&quot; ===
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) used once again the television show &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; to select its entry, as it had since its debut at the contest in 1957. 

==== Competing entries ====
Of the entries, songwriters Tony Hiller, Martin Lee and Paul Curtis had had songs in the Eurovision final before. Stephanie De Sykes and Stuart Slater had twice won the &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; contest previously, in both and . Songwriter Marty Kristian had competed with the New Seekers in 1972. His group featured former New Seekers singer Kathy Ann Rae and former entrant Lance Aston (of Prima Donna). &quot;When the Kissing Stops&quot;, written by Martin Lee and Barry Upton of Brotherhood of Man together with their longtime writing partner Tony Hiller (who had co-written &quot;Save Your Kisses For Me&quot; with Lee), was originally intended for the group themselves, but they decided it would be best not to risk losing and thus not to take part; although all four members of the group attended the broadcast. The group did go on to record the song however and it featured on their album &quot;Lightning Flash&quot;. The writers of &quot;Keeping Our Love Alive&quot;, Doug Flett and Guy Fletcher had written many previous British finalists, including the winner &quot;Power to All Our Friends&quot;. The group Casablanca were short lived, but the three main artists, Des Dyer, Samantha Spencer-Lane and Carla Donnelly all featured in other editions of the British final.

==== Final ====
The final was held on 24 March 1983 at the BBC Television Theatre in London, and was hosted by Terry Wogan. The BBC Concert Orchestra under the direction of John Coleman as conductor accompanied all the songs, but all the music was pre-recorded. Prior to the voting, a dance and song montage filmed at the Royal Mint was played featuring the song &quot;Money (That&#x27;s What I Want)&quot;. The votes of eight regional juries based in Cardiff, Belfast, Norwich, Glasgow, Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester and London decided the winner. Each jury region awarded 15 points to their favourite song, 12 points to the second, 10 points to the third and then 9, 8, 7, 6 and 5 points in order of preference for the songs from 4th to 8th.

After Bardo&#x27;s &quot;One Step Further&quot; in the Eurovision Song Contest 1982, the United Kingdom placed one spot better at sixth place, scoring 79 points, with &quot;I&#x27;m Never Giving Up&quot; by Sweet Dreams.

The contest was broadcast on BBC1 (with commentary by Terry Wogan). Wogan also provided commentary to viewers in Ireland (RTÉ 1) and Australia (Channel 0/28).

Due to the contest being held on St. George&#x27;s Day, BBC Radio 2 opted not to broadcast the contest as they had already made plans to broadcast &quot;The St. George&#x27;s Day Concert&quot; held at the same time. Colin Berry returned as spokesperson for the UK jury.

<text>House of Dolls is a 1953 novella by Ka-tzetnik 135633. The novella describes &quot;Joy Divisions&quot;, which were groups of women imprisoned in the concentration camps during World War II who were kept for the sexual pleasure of other inmates.

== Origins ==

Between 1942 and 1945, Auschwitz and nine other Nazi concentration camps contained camp brothels (&quot;Freudenabteilungen&quot;, or &quot;Joy Divisions&quot;), mainly used to reward cooperative non-Jewish inmates.

In the documentary film &quot;Memory of the Camps&quot;, a project supervised by the British Ministry of Information and the American Office of War Information during the summer of 1945, camera crews filmed women who had been forced into sexual slavery, reporting that &quot;Dachau had its own brothel for the use of guards and favored prisoners.&quot; The filmmakers stated that as the women died they were replaced by fresh contingents from the concentration camp at Ravensbrück.

The novel tells the story of a Jewish woman named Daniella who is &quot;forced to become a prostitute for German soldiers ... in Block 24 of Auschwitz-Stammlager.&quot; However, while Block 24 really did house a brothel, in reality &quot;it was a brothel for prisoners. Members of the Wehrmacht and SS were not allowed to visit it. The forced prostitutes were mostly German or Polish — none of them were Jewish, neither was any of them called Daniella, as records of the Auschwitz administration show. A military brothel for German soldiers and SS guards also existed, but it was located outside of the camp, and all women there were German civilian prostitutes.&quot; While there certainly were reports by survivors of male German guards sexually abusing female Jewish inmates, &quot;no archival evidence exists that points to the systematic rape of Jewish women in concentration camps or of their enslavement in Nazi brothels.&quot;

==Literature and scholarly references==
In his essay &quot;Narrative Perspectives on Holocaust Literature&quot;, Leon Yudkin uses &quot;House of Dolls&quot; as one of his key examples of the ways in which authors have approached the Holocaust, using the work as an example of &quot;diaries (testimonies) that look like novels&quot; due to its reliance on its author&#x27;s own experiences.

Ronit Lentin discusses &quot;House of Dolls&quot; in her work &quot;Israel and the Daughters of the Shoah&quot;. In her book Lentin interviews a child of Holocaust survivors, who recalls &quot;House of Dolls&quot; as one of her first exposures to the Holocaust. Lentin notes that the &quot;explicit, painful&quot; story made a huge impact when published and states that &quot;many children of holocaust survivors who write would agree ... that &quot;House of Dolls&quot; represents violence and sexuality in a manner which borders on the pornographic&quot;.

Na&#x27;ama Shik, researching at Yad Vashem, the principal Jewish organization for the remembrance of the victims of the Holocaust, considers the book as fiction. Nonetheless it is part of the Israeli high school curriculum.

The success of the book showed there was a market for Nazi exploitation popular literature, known in Israel as Stalags. However Yechiel Szeintuch from the Hebrew University rejects links between the smutty Stalags on the one hand, and Ka-Tzetnik&#x27;s works, which he insists were based on reality, on the other.

==In popular culture==
British post-punk band Joy Division took their name from the reference in this book. One of their early songs, &quot;No Love Lost&quot;, also contains a short excerpt from the novella.

&quot;Love Camp 7&quot; (1968), considered to be the first Nazi exploitation film, is set in a concentration camp &quot;Joy Division&quot;.

<doc id="425789" wikidata="Q794255" url="?curid=425789" title="New Union (Social Liberals)">
<text>The New Union (Social Liberals) (, NS) was a social-liberal political party in Lithuania. The NS was a member of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR) and an observer of the Liberal International. It was founded in 1998 and is led by Artūras Paulauskas.

== History ==

=== Establishment and participation in government (1998–2006) ===
The party was formed in 1998 on a basis of Artūras Paulauskas presidential campaign team.

Its policy was based on social liberalism: the principal values of which are personal freedom, social solidarity, welfare of people and justice.

In 2000, municipal elections the party won the most seats in municipalities districts&#x27; councils.

In 2000,it formed a coalition government with the Liberal Union (along with Lithuanian Centre Union and Modern Christian Democrats), but after disagreements between two, in 2001, a new coalition with the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party (LSDP) was formed.

Its candidate Vilija Blinkevičiūtė won 16.6% of the votes in the 2004 presidential election. At that year&#x27;s parliamentary election, the party ran in alliance with the Social Democratic Party (LSDP) under the label &#x27;Coalition of Algirdas Brazauskas and Artūras Paulauskas: Working for Lithuania&#x27;. The list won 31 seats out of 141, of which the New Union won 11. After these elections, a coalition with the LSDP, the Labour Party and Lithuanian Popular Peasant Union (LVLS), which lasted up until summer of 2006.

=== In opposition, in government and dissolution (2006–2011) ===

In January 2008, the party joined new coalition, which consisted from the LSDP, the LVLS, Civic Democratic Party and Liberal and Centre Union.

At the 2008 parliamentary election, the party lost heavily, winning only one seat in the Seimas and only 3.64% of the national vote. As other parties that were part of coalition governments in the outgoing parliament suffered in the elections (Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, Labour Party, Liberal and Centre Union and Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union), all lost seats in the Seimas and in the new parliament a centre-right coalition under Andrius Kubilius had the most seats. It left the New Union in opposition.

The party&#x27;s one member in the Seimas, Valerijus Simulik, sat with the Social Democratic Party political group. In 2011, the party merged with the Labour Party. A minority faction switched to the Liberal and Centre Union.

<doc id="425797" wikidata="Q7888078" url="?curid=425797" title="United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1984">
<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1984 with the song &quot;Love Games&quot;, written by Paul Curtis and Graham Sacher, and performed by Belle and the Devotions. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final.

==Before Eurovision==
=== &quot;A Song for Europe 1984&quot; ===
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) used once again the television show &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; to select its entry, as it had since its debut at the contest in 1957. 

The BBC held the national final on 4 April 1984 at Studio 1 of the BBC Television Centre in London, hosted once again by Terry Wogan. The BBC Concert Orchestra under the direction of John Coleman as conductor accompanied all the songs, but all the music was pre-recorded. Of the entrants, songwriter Paul Curtis had no less than four of the eight entries (going on to take three of the top four places). The votes of eight regional juries based in Edinburgh, Norwich, Belfast, London, Cardiff, Manchester, Bristol and Birmingham decided the winner. Each jury region awarded 15 points to their favourite song, 12 points to the second, 10 points to the third and then 9, 8, 7, 6 and 5 points in order of preference for the songs from 4th to 8th. In an plan to modernise the show, computer graphics where used for the first time during the voting.

Singers Sinitta and Hazell Dean would later go on to become successful chart acts - both under the producership of Stock Aitken Waterman. The latter scoring her first top 10 hit just a few weeks after the contest.



==== UK Discography ====

*Bryan Evans - &quot;This Love Is Deep&quot;: Charisma CB413.
*Belle &amp; The Devotions - &quot;Love Games&quot;: CBS A4332 (7&quot; Single)/TA4332 (12&quot; Single).
*First Division - &quot;Where The Action Is&quot;: Panther PAN3.
*Miriam Anne Lesley - &quot;Let It Shine&quot;: RCA RCA403.
*Sinitta - &quot;Imagination&quot;: Magnet MAG258.
*Hazell Dean - &quot;Stay In My Life&quot;: Proto ENA116.

==At Eurovision==
Belle &amp; the Devotions were booed at the Contest partly as reaction after English football fans had run riot in Luxembourg a few months earlier, causing extensive damage to the city and by the Dutch delegation in protest that the three backing singers for the group who were in fact performing the song were never seen by the TV viewers (the BBC maintained that this was because one was pregnant) whereas the two members of the Devotions, Laura James and Linda Sofeld, were miming their vocals. Despite the reception, the group finished 7th with 63 points and reaching no.11 in the UK singles chart, the highest chart placing of any UK entry between 1983 and 1994. Sweden ended up winning the competition with the song &quot;Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley&quot;.

Terry Wogan once again provided the television commentary for BBC 1, for the second consecutive year Radio 2 opted not to broadcast the contest, however the contest was broadcast on British Forces Radio with commentary provided by Richard Nankivell. The BBC appointed again Colin Berry as its spokesperson to announce the results of the British jury.

<doc id="425802" wikidata="Q447889" url="?curid=425802" title="Marie Anne de La Trémoille, princesse des Ursins">
<text>Marie Anne de La Trémoille, princesse des Ursins (1642 – 5 December 1722), was a French courtier and royal favourite known for her political influence, being a &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Spain from 1701 until 1714. She spent most of her life as an agent of French influence abroad, at first in Rome, and then in Spain under the new Bourbon dynasty, followed by a final period at the exiled Stuart court in Rome. She played a central role in the Spanish royal court during the first years of the reign of Philip V, until she was ousted from the country following a power struggle with the new queen consort, Elisabeth Farnese.

==Life and family==
She was the daughter of Louis II de La Trémoille, Duc de Noirmoutier, and his wife Renée Julie Aubery de Tilleport. She belonged to a cadet branch of the La Trémoille family, which held the exalted rank of &quot;prince étranger&quot; in France. She was married young to Adrien Blaise de Talleyrand, Prince de Chalais. Her husband, having been implicated in the duel of four against four, in which Pierre de Beauvilliers, son of the Duc de Saint-Aignan, was killed in 1663, was compelled to flee France. He died soon afterward in Spain, and Marie Anne, now widowed, established herself in Rome. 

In 1675, she married Flavio Orsini, Duke di Bracciano (1620–1698). The marriage was far from harmonious, but her husband left her his fortune (popular imagination thought it to be huge, but in reality, the duke was almost bankrupt) and the leadership of the French party in Rome. It brought her a series of lawsuits and troubles with Livio Odescalchi, nephew of Pope Innocent XI, who claimed that he had been adopted by the duke. Eventually, the widow sold the title and estates to Odescalchi.

She then assumed the title &quot;Princesse des Ursins&quot;, a French translation of Orsini, and was tacitly allowed to use it, though it had no legal basis. She had indulged in much unofficial diplomacy at Rome, particularly with Neapolitans and Spaniards of rank, whom it was desirable to secure as French partisans in view of the approaching death of Charles II of Spain, and the plans of Louis XIV to place his family on the Spanish throne.

Her services in favour of France were rewarded in 1699 by a pension, which her problematic financial situation made necessary. When Philippe of France, Duke of Anjou, grandson of the French king, was declared heir by the will of Charles II, she took an active part in arranging his marriage with Princess Maria Luisa of Savoy, a daughter of Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy. Her ambition was to secure the post of &quot;camarera mayor de palacio&quot; (head of the queen&#x27;s household) to the young queen, a child of barely thirteen. By quiet diplomacy and with the help of Madame de Maintenon, she succeeded, and in 1701, she accompanied the young queen to Spain.

Until 1714, the year of the death of the queen, she was the most powerful person in the country. Her functions in relation to the king and queen were almost those of a nurse. Her letters show that she had to put them to bed at night, and get them up in the morning. She gives a most amusing description of her embarrassments when she had to enter the royal bedroom, laden with articles of clothing and furniture. But if the &quot;camarera mayor de palacio&quot; did the work of a domestic servant, it was for a serious political purpose. She was expected to look after French interests in the palace and to manage the Spanish nobles, many of whom were of the Austrian party, and who were generally opposed to foreign ways or to interference with the elaborate etiquette of the Spanish court.

Madame des Ursins was resolved not to be a mere agent of Versailles. During the first period of her tenure, she was in frequent conflict with the French ambassadors, who claimed the right to attend the privy council and to direct the government. Madame des Ursins urged that the young king should rely as much as possible on his Spanish subjects. In 1704, her enemies at the French court secured her recall, but she still had the support of Madame de Maintenon, and her own tact enabled her to placate Louis XIV.

===Spain===
In 1705, she returned to Spain with a free hand, and with what was practically the power to name her own ministry. During the worst times of the War of the Spanish Succession, she was the real head of the Bourbon party and was well aided by Princess Maria Luisa of Savoy, the spirited young queen of Philip V. She did not hesitate to quarrel even with so powerful a personage as Cardinal Luis de Portocarrero, Archbishop of Toledo, when he proved hostile. Yet she was so far from offending the pride of the nation that, when in 1709 Louis XIV, severely pressed by the other Great Powers, threatened or pretended to desert the cause of his grandson, she dismissed all Frenchmen from the court and threw the king on the support of the Castilians.

Her influence on the sovereigns was dominant until the death of the queen. Madame des Ursins confesses in her voluminous correspondence that she made herself a burden to the king in her anxiety to exclude from him all other influence, watching him as if he were a child. Philip was too weak to break the yoke himself and could insist only that he should be supplied with a wife. Madame des Ursins was persuaded by Alberoni to arrange a marriage with Elisabeth Farnese, hoping to govern the new queen as she had done the old.

However, Saint-Simon relates that the princess tried first to become queen of Spain herself and, when this plan failed, she persuaded Alberoni to choose a member of the House of Farnese, hoping that Elisabeth, who could not otherwise have hoped for a royal crown, would feel indebted to her. In trying to become queen, Madame des Ursins lost the last remnants of support from Madame de Maintenon; in promoting Elisabeth Farnese without French consent, she also lost Louis XIV&#x27;s support.

Elisabeth Farnese managed to stipulate that she should be allowed to dismiss the &quot;camarera mayor&quot;. Madame des Ursins, who had gone to meet the new queen at Quadraque near the frontier, was driven from her presence with insult and sent out of Spain without being allowed to change her court dress, in such bitter weather that the coachman lost his hand by frostbite. In Bayonne, she waited for a while hoping that the king would call her back, but in vain. Saint-Simon believes that the dismissal had been schemed beforehand, and even happened with the consent of the king. After a short stay in France, she went to Italy, eventually establishing herself in Rome, where she imposed her personality on the small &quot;émigré&quot; Jacobite court of &quot;The Old Pretender&quot;, effectively running it until she died on 5 December 1722. She had the final satisfaction of meeting Alberoni there after his fall.

==Legacy==
Madame des Ursins has the credit of having begun to check the overgrown power of the church and the Inquisition in Spain, and of having attempted to bring the finances to order.

In his &quot;Mémoires&quot;, Saint-Simon draws a devastating portrait of a scheming intrigant, her accomplices and minions, without crediting the important and sometimes positive role the princess played in getting and keeping the royal pair on the throne, and improving the poor finances of the kingdom of Spain (despite his harsh view of her political influence, Saint-Simon admits that he personally liked and admired her).

Madame des Ursins also is credited with having introduced the essence of bitter orange as a fashionable fragrance by using it to perfume her gloves and her bath. Since then, the name of Neroli (she was Princess of Nerola, in Lazio, Italy) has been used to describe this essence.

Traditional instruments reflect these widespread origins: the and owe their existence to the introduction of the guitar by early Arab or European seafarers, the ubiquitous originated in mainland Africa and the —the bamboo tube zither considered the national instrument of Madagascar—directly evolved from an earlier form of zither carried with the first Austronesian settlers on their outrigger canoes.

Malagasy music can be roughly divided into three categories: traditional, contemporary and popular music. Traditional musical styles vary by region and reflect local ethnographic history. For instance, in the Highlands, the and more subdued vocal styles are emblematic of the Merina, the predominantly Austronesian ethnic group that has inhabited the area since at least the 15th century, whereas among the southern Bara people, who trace their ancestry back to the African mainland, their &quot;a cappella&quot; vocal traditions bear close resemblance to the polyharmonic singing style common to South Africa. Foreign instruments such as the acoustic guitar and piano have been adapted locally to create uniquely Malagasy forms of music. Contemporary Malagasy musical styles such as the or have evolved from traditional styles modernized by the incorporation of electric guitar, bass, drums and synthesizer. Many Western styles of popular music, including rock, gospel, jazz, reggae, hip-hop and folk rock, have also gained in popularity in Madagascar over the later half of the 20th century.

Music in Madagascar has served a variety of sacred and secular functions. In addition to its performance for entertainment or personal creative expression, music has played a key part in spiritual ceremonies, cultural events and historic and contemporary political functions. By the late 19th century, certain instruments and types of music became primarily associated with specific castes or ethnic groups, although these divisions have always been fluid and are continually evolving.

==Traditional music==

Malagasy music is highly melodic and distinguishes itself from many traditions of mainland Africa by the predominance of chordophone relative to percussion instruments. Musical instruments and vocal styles found in Madagascar represent a blend of widespread commonalities and highly localized traditions. A common vocal style among the Merina and Betsileo of the Highlands, for instance, does not preclude differences in the prevalence of particular instrument types (the among the Merina, and the and among the Betsileo). Similarly, the practice of (entering a trance state, typically induced by music) is present on both the western and eastern coasts of the island but the vocal styles or instruments used in the ceremony will vary regionally. Music in Madagascar tends toward major keys and diatonic scales, although coastal music makes frequent use of minor keys, most likely due to early Arab influences at coastal ports of call. Malagasy music has served a wide range of social, spiritual and mundane functions across the centuries.
=== Vocal traditions ===

Vocal traditions in Madagascar are most often polyharmonic; southern vocal styles bear strong resemblance to South African singing (as exemplified by groups such as Salala or Senge), whereas Highland harmonies, strongly influenced in the past two hundred years by European church music, are more reminiscent of Hawaiian or other Polynesian vocal traditions. Numerous amateur choirs performing Malagasy and Western music can be found in the capital region; the ensemble iCanto is a notable example of a professional choir, with concerts broadcast on national television. In the Highlands, and particularly in the 19th century, vocal performance by large groups called was favored, while in the south and western coastal regions singing was performed with more elaborate ornamentation and in small groups. 

Musical performance in Madagascar has often been associated with spiritual functions. Music is a key component in achieving a trance state in (or ) spiritual rituals practiced in several regions of the island, as it is believed that each spirit has a different preferred piece of music. The association between music and ancestors is so strong on the eastern coast that some musicians will put rum, cigarettes or other valued objects inside an instrument (through the tone hole, for instance) as an offering to the spirits to receive their blessings. Similarly, music has long been central to the ceremony (periodic reburial of ancestors&#x27; shroud-wrapped mortal remains). 

=== Musical instruments ===

Instruments in Madagascar were brought to the island by successive waves of settlers from across the Old World. Over 1500 years ago, the earliest settlers from Indonesia brought the oldest and most emblematic instruments, including the tube zither () which evolved into a box form () distinct to the island. Later settlers from the Arabian peninsula and the eastern coast of Africa contributed early lutes, whistles and other instruments that were incorporated into local musical traditions by the mid-16th century. The influence of instruments and musical styles from France and Great Britain began to have a significant impact on music in Madagascar by the 19th century.

==== Chordophones ====
The most emblematic instrument of Madagascar, the , is a bamboo tube zither very similar in form to those used traditionally in Indonesia and the Philippines. The is considered the national instrument of Madagascar. It is typically tuned to a diatonic mode to produce complex music based on harmonic, parallel thirds accompanied by a melodic bass line. The strings are traditionally cut and raised from the fibrous surface of the bamboo tube itself, although a contemporary form also exists that instead uses bicycle brake cables for strings to give the instrument a punchier sound. 

Strings may be plucked with the fingernails, which are allowed to grow longer for this purpose. The instrument was originally used for rituals and for creative artistic expression alike. However, beginning in the mid-19th century, playing the instrument became the prerogative of the Merina aristocracy to such an extent that possessing long fingernails became symbolic of nobility. While the tubular is the most emblematic form of the instrument most likely due to its popularization by the 19th century Merina aristocracy, other forms of the instrument exist across the island. In the region around the eastern port city of Toamasina, for instance, used in ceremonies may take a rectangular box form called . While some regions construct their from wood, near Toamasina the box is constructed of metal sheeting with much thicker and heavier strings that produce a different sound from the bamboo and bicycle cable of the Highlands.

The (or ) is a four to six-stringed simple guitar common in the southern Highlands moving toward the east, particularly among the Betsimisaraka and Betsileo ethnic groups. The soundbox, which is typically square or rectangular today, was originally circular in form, first made from a tortoise shell and later from wood carved into a rounded shape. and are the Antandroy names of a popular Southern chordophone similar to the but with nylon fishing line for strings and five or seven movable frets that facilitate modification of the instrument&#x27;s tuning.

The is a chordophone that traditionally has two sisal strings, three frets and a calabash resonator, although modern versions may have as many as eleven or thirteen strings, typically made of steel. A maximum of four of these are strung over the frets, while the rest are strung lengthwise down the sides of the neck and are strummed with the fingers in accompaniment to the primary melody which is played with a bow. This more elaborate is especially popular among the Betsileo of the southern Highlands and the Betsimisaraka of the southeast, who play it in accompaniment to their sung epic poems, called . In 19th-century Highlands society under the Kingdom of Imerina, the was considered to be a slave instrument which only mature men were permitted to play. The , an evolved with the sound box carved to resemble a three-stringed fiddle, is popular among the Southern Antandroy and Bara ethnic groups. The simplest form of instrument in this family is the (musical bow), believed to have been brought to Madagascar by settlers from mainland Africa.

The piano was introduced to the royal Merina court in the early 19th century by envoys of the London Missionary Society, and soon afterward, local musicians began creating their own compositions for piano based on technique. Piano compositions reached their peak with the style in the 1920s and 1930s before declining in the 1940s. Today, the compositions of this period by pianist theatrical composers like Andrianary Ratianarivo (1895–1949) and Naka Rabemananatsoa (1892–1952) form part of the canon of classical Malagasy music and feature in the repertoire of Malagasy students of piano.

When the modern acoustic guitar was first popularized in Madagascar, it was adopted by the lower classes who were inspired by the piano style but for whom the purchase of a costly piano was out of reach. Early guitarists adapted the piano style (itself based on style) to this novel stringed instrument to create a genre that came to be known as . Soon afterward, the guitar was widely disseminated throughout the island, producing an explosion of regionally distinctive Malagasy guitar styles inspired by the music played on local traditional instruments. Finger picking is the favored technique and guitarists frequently experiment with original tunings to obtain the desired range. One of the most common tunings drops the sixth string from E to C and the fifth string from A to G, thereby enabling the guitarist to capture a range approximating that of a vocal choir. The Malagasy acoustic guitar style has been internationally promoted by such artists as Erick Manana and pioneering Bara artist Ernest Randrianasolo (better known by his stage name D&#x27;Gary), who blends the rhythms of with innovative open tunings to approximate the sounds of the , and .

==== Aerophones ====
The , an end-blown flute, is believed to be one of the oldest instruments on the island. There exists the more common and well-known short , about a foot long with six finger holes and one for the thumb, and another similar end-blown flute over two feet long with three holes at the far end. Both are open-ended and are played by blowing diagonally across the near opening. The master of performance, Rakoto Frah, was featured on the 1000 Malagasy franc (200 ariary) banknote after independence in 1960 and his death on 29 September 2001 prompted national mourning.

The conch shell ( or ) is a similarly ancient instrument believed to have been brought over by early Indonesian settlers. Mainly played by men, it features a lateral blow hole in the Polynesian style and is typically reserved for ritual or spiritual uses rather than to create music for entertainment. The &quot;antsiva&quot; has also been recorded to have been used as part of Merina royal regalia. The fipple flute is a simple aerophone brought to Madagascar after 1000 CE by immigrants from Africa.

The two-octave diatonic accordion (), popular across Madagascar, is believed to have been imported by French colonists after 1896. In the 20th century, the instrument was commonly performed during spirit possession ceremonies in a style called . In the 1970s, the was incorporated for the performance of electrified music. This accordion style was also integrated into the performance of , while also inspiring the style used by the guitarists in these bands. Although today the sound of the accordion is most often replicated by a synthesizer in or bands due to the expense and rarity of the instrument, accordions continue to hold a privileged place in the performance of ceremonial music. Artists like half-brothers Lego and Rossy have gained success as accordion players. Régis Gizavo brought the contemporary style of to the world music scene, winning several international awards for his accordion performance.

A variety of European aerophones were introduced in the 19th century under the Merina monarchy. These most notably include bugles () and clarinets (), and less frequently the trombone or oboe (). Their use today is largely restricted to the Highlands and the or bands that perform at (reburials), circumcisions and other traditional celebrations. Metal and wood harmonicas are also played.

==== Membranophones ====

Various types of membranophones, traditionally associated with solemn occasions, are found throughout the island. In the Highlands, European bass drums () and snare drums introduced in the 19th century have replaced an earlier drum () traditionally beat to accentuate the discourse of a speaker during a or other formal occasions where the oratory art of is practiced. Only men can play the , while women and men may both play the smaller drum. The (&quot;male wood&quot;) drum produces the deepest sound and is reserved for the most significant occasions such as , circumcision ceremonies and the ancient festival of the royal bath.

==== Idiophones ====

Bamboo shakers () filled with seeds are integral to the performance of on the eastern coast of the island, although modern items such as empty insecticide tins or sweetened condensed milk cans filled with pebbles increasingly take the place of traditional bamboo. Shakers of this sort are used throughout Madagascar, commonly in conjunction with and other ceremonies. During the slave trade era, another idiophone—a scraper called the —was popularized in Madagascar after being imported there from Brazil where it is known as a &quot;caracacha&quot;.

Early forms of xylophone such as the are found throughout the island and are believed to have come across with the original Indonesian settlers. The earliest of these is played uniquely by a pair of women, one of whom sits with her legs outstretched together and the bars of the xylophone resting across her legs rather than on a separate resonator box. Each woman strikes the with a pair of sticks, one keeping the beat while the second plays a melody. The xylophone bars range from five to seven in number and are made of differing lengths of a rot-resistant wood called . A similar xylophone called is still played in the southwest among the Vezo and Bara ethnic groups.

== Contemporary music ==

Contemporary music comprises modern-day compositions that have their roots in traditional musical styles and have been created for entertainment purposes, typically with the intent of eventual mass dissemination via cassette, compact disc, radio or internet. Modern forms of Malagasy music may incorporate such innovations as amplified or imported instruments (particularly electric guitar, bass guitar, synthesizer and drum kit), blend the sounds of new and traditional instruments or use traditional instruments in innovative ways. As contemporary artists adapt their musical heritage to today&#x27;s market, they manage to preserve the melodic, chordophone-dominated sound that distinguishes traditional Malagasy music from the more percussion-heavy traditions of mainland Africa.
African genres like Coupé-décalé and Afrobeats 
heavily influence modern malagasy popular music.

=== Highlands ===

In the 1950s and 1960s, a variety of bands in the Highlands (in the area between and around Antananarivo and Fianarantsoa) were performing covers of European and American hits or adapting mainland African tunes for local audiences. Madagascar got its first supergroup in the 1970s with Mahaleo, whose members blended traditional Malagasy sounds with soft rock to enormous and enduring success. Rossy emerged as a superstar shortly afterward, adapting the instrumentation, rhythms and vocal styles of the to create a distinctly Malagasy radio-friendly sound. His open and enthusiastic support for then-President Didier Ratsiraka assured his band regular performances in association with Presidential functions, and his band came to define the Ratsiraka epoch for many.

Other important contemporary musicians from the Highlands include Justin Vali and Sylvestre Randafison, both virtuosos; Rakoto Frah, who could play two simultaneously; Solo Miral, featuring guitar played in the style of a ; Tarika, a Malagasy fusion band based in England; Olombelona Ricky, a highly accomplished solo vocalist, and Samoëla, a roots artist whose blunt social and political critiques propelled his group to popularity.

=== Coastal styles ===

Distinct contemporary forms of music, rooted in local musical traditions, have emerged in the coastal regions since the 1960s. Chief among these are two up-tempo dance music styles that have become especially popular across Madagascar and have achieved crossover success: , a  style that originated in the northwest around Mahajanga and Antsiranana, and , a  style centered in the southwest between Toliara and Betroka. Other key coastal styles include of Diego-Suarez and the northeast coast as popularized by Mika sy Davis, of Morondava and the southwestern interior, of the southern Anosy region performed by such groups as Rabaza, of the northeast as popularized by Jerry Marcoss, the southern polyharmonic tradition performed by bands like Senge and Terakaly, and and music from neighboring Reunion Island and Mauritius.
&quot;&quot;

 is funky, energetic dance music dominated by ringing electric guitars, accordion (real or synthesized), and call-and-response polyphonic vocals, with heavy electric bass and a driving percussion. The percussion section might include a drum kit, djembe, and shakers.

 is an electrified version of the traditional musical style that Tandroy singer Mama Sana used to perform at Betsimisaraka and Tsimihety rituals. 
In addition to their commonalities in tempo, vocal style, and tendency toward minor keys (which some attribute to an Arab influence, and which stands in contrast to the major key dominance of Highland music), the shares the &#x27;s structure in that it always features a middle section called the (&quot;broken&quot;) which is primarily instrumental—voice serves only to urge on more energetic dancing—and during which the vocalists (and the audience) will launch into intricate polyrhythmic hand-clapping to the beat of the music.

The major exponents of modern were Jaojoby and Mily Clément. Among the later artists are Ninie Doniah, Wawa, Vaiavy Chila, and Dr. J.B. and the Jaguars.
Like , is energetic dance music that originated from the traditional music of the southwestern region around Toliara and that has recently been adapted to contemporary instruments such as electric guitar, bass guitar and drum kit. Generally even more rapid than the , this form of music features a guitar performance style inspired by traditional compositions, but the influence of South African township music is evident in both the guitars and polyharmonic vocals, often performed by female singers who repeat variations on a short refrain throughout the song. music is performed at all manner of ceremonial occasion in the South, whether a birthday celebration, community party, or funeral. While had risen to national popularity by the mid-1980s (some would argue the 1970s), only truly began to garner a similar level of widespread appreciation by the mid-1990s. It was not until the 2000 release of the &quot;Tulear Never Sleeps&quot; compilation album that the genre achieved international exposure on a major label. This compilation, however, showcases &quot;traditional&quot; , such as might have more commonly been performed in rural villages twenty years ago, rather than the amplified, synthesized and remixed style in heavy rotation on radio stations performed by national stars like Tearano, Terakaly, Jarifa, and Mamy Gotso.

There are many more regional styles of contemporary music that have yet to achieve the level of national recognition attained by and just as there are many nationally and internationally acclaimed musicians who draw upon the musical traditions of the coastal regions in their compositions. Of note are Hazolahy (a largely acoustic roots band from the Southeast that plays ), D&#x27;Gary (an acclaimed acoustic guitarist from the inland South near Betroka), and Toto Mwandjani (who popularized Congolese &quot;ndombolo&quot;-style guitar, and whose band performs a fusion of Central/East African and Malagasy dance styles).

=== Popular music ===

A wide range of foreign music styles have been popularized in Madagascar, including French performed by artists such as Poopy, reggae, gospel music, and pop rock performed by bands such as Green and AmbondronA. Since mid-2010s malagasy popular music has been a blend of malagasy music, tropical music (Zouk) and African genres like Coupé décalé and Afrobeats. Artists of this new wave of malagasy music include Black Nadia, Vaiavy Chila, LIANAH and BIG MJ. Jazz has been popularized by artists such as Nicolas Vatomanga. Malagasy hip hop broke into the mainstream in the mid-nineties and has since skyrocketed to popularity through artists such as Da Hopp and 18,3. More recently bands like Oladad are experimenting with the fusion of hip-hop and traditional Malagasy musical styles and instruments. There is also a small metal scene with bands like Sasamaso being the most prominent.Dancehall has gained popularity in Madagascar since late 2010s with artists like Mad Max and Basta Lion.

== Performance of Malagasy music ==

Music has long served a variety of secular and sacred purposes in Madagascar. Song may accompany daily tasks, provide entertainment, preserve history or communicate social and political messages. Music is likewise integral to the experience of spiritual ritual among many ethnic and religious groups on the island.

=== Secular performance ===

Among some ethnic groups music would help advance a repetitive or arduous task. Geo Shaw, a missionary to Madagascar in the 19th century, described observing Betsileo and Merina serfs singing in the rice fields, &quot;timing the music to the movements of their bodies, so that at each accented note they plant a stalk.&quot; Similarly, songs may accompany the paddling of dugout canoes on long journeys. Music may also accompany another form of entertainment, such as songs chanted by female spectators at matches of , a traditional form of full-body wrestling popular in coastal regions.

The preservation of oral history may be achieved through musical performance in Madagascar. Among the Betsileo, for instance, oral histories are retold through a form of musical performance called the , which in its current form may represent a combination of the original, single-verse and an epic poem called the . The Betsileo is performed by two men who each play a while singing very loudly with a strained pitch in the soprano range. The structure of the song is complex and, unlike other Malagasy musical styles, parallel thirds are not predominant in the harmony. Other Southern ethnic groups also perform simplified variations of the featuring for example a solo musician who strums rather than fiddles his accompanying instrument and sings at a lower, more natural pitch. While the Betsileo can address diverse themes, those performed by other southern groups are almost always praise songs recalling a favorably memorable event.

Endogenous musical styles may also serve as a form of artistic expression, as in the highly syncopated genre of Imerina. The emerged in conjunction with the French introduction of operetta and the subsequent rise of Malagasy theater at the &quot;Theatre Municipale d&#x27;Isotry&quot; beginning in the late 1910s. The vocal style used in is characterized by female use of , a vocal ornamentation delivered in a nasal tone, offset by the (tenor) and rapid-moving (baritone) line sung by the men. inspired the musical duet style , popularized in Imerina during the final two decades of the colonial period, in which the vocal sensibilities are applied to love themes and accompanied by a syncopated composition for piano or occasionally guitar.

Musical performance in the Highlands took on a distinctly political and educative role through the (: song; : Malagasy). The is a day-long spectacle of music, dance, and a stylized form of traditional oratory known as performed by a troupe or as a competition between two or more troupes. While the origins of the are uncertain, oral history attributes its modern form to 18th century Merina king Andrianampoinimerina, who reportedly employed musicians to gather the public together for royal speeches and announcements () and to entertain them as they labored on public works projects such as building dikes to irrigate the rice paddies surrounding Antananarivo. Over time, these musicians formed independent troupes who used and continue to use the non-threatening performance format to explore sensitive social and political themes in the public arena.

The troupes of today are remnants of a tradition of court musicians that persisted through the end of the 19th century. Under Queen Ranavalona III, the final monarch in the Merina dynasty, there were three official groups of state musicians: one for the queen, one for her prime minister, and another for the city of Antananarivo. The queen&#x27;s troupe consisted of over 300 musicians. Until slavery was abolished, musicians in these groups were members of the slave class () directed by a (free Merina). Each year at Christmas, the directors of each group would arrange a performance before the queen of a new original composition; the queen would select a winner among the three. While court musicians (and therefore the earliest troupes) originally performed using traditional instruments – namely the , and drums - over the course of the 19th century the increasing European influence led court musicians and troupes alike to make increasing use of foreign instruments such as violins, clarinets, trombones and trumpets. The tradition of the court musician died out with the abolition of the monarchy in Madagascar after French colonization, but the tradition has continued to thrive.

Musical styles from abroad have been merged with pre-existing Malagasy musical traditions to create distinctly Malagasy sounds with foreign roots. An example of this is the , a tune based on the French quadrille that was popularized in the Malagasy court in the 19th century. A specific form of partner dance accompanies this piece, in which dancers will form a long chain of male-female pairs with the woman at the front of each pair, both facing forward holding each other&#x27;s hands while advancing to the rhythm of the music. From its origins as a courtly dance, the today is a quintessentially Malagasy tradition performed at the beginning of a social event or concert to kick off the festivities.

=== Sacred performance ===

Music is a common element of spiritual ritual and ceremonies throughout the island. For instance, members of troupes are traditionally invited to perform at the reburial ceremonies of central Madagascar. In coastal regions, music is crucial to helping a medium enter a trance state during a ritual. While in a trance, the medium is possessed by an ancestral spirit. Each spirit is believed to prefer a particular tune or style of music and will not enter the medium unless the suitable piece of music is performed at the ceremony.

British missionaries of the London Missionary Society (LMS) arrived in Antananarivo in 1820 during the reign of King Radama I. The subsequent spread of Christianity in Madagascar was coupled with the introduction of solfège as missionaries developed Malagasy-language hymns for their nascent church. The first wave of missionaries was obliged to depart Madagascar under Ranavalona I in 1836, but the hymns they developed became anthems for early Malagasy converts persecuted under the Queen&#x27;s traditionalist policies. In 1871, an LMS missionary (J. Richardson) improved the rhythm and harmony of these original hymns, which were considerably influenced by European musical styles such as quadrilles and waltzes. Originally, church music was performed by slaves seated in groups of four to five at the front of the church. By the 1870s a more European congregational style had been adopted with all members of the church rising to their feet to sing together.

<text>J.R. Digs is a Canadian television personality. He is best known for his Gemini Award-nominated late night show &quot;JR Digs: Man with a Van&quot;, which aired on Global from 2008 to 2014.

==Background==
Digs, at the time a skateboard shop owner in Burlington, Ontario, first launched &quot;The JR Digs Show&quot; on CHCH in 2001. Originally a stunt comedy series based on &quot;Jackass&quot;, Digs purchased the airtime himself and solicited his own advertising and sponsorships to recover his costs. In 2003, Global began airing the show, under the same production model.

In 2006, Digs launched &quot;Be Real with JR Digs&quot;, a comedy series in which he tried to make a compelling reality show out of ordinary people partaking in everyday activities, and &quot;In the Can with JR Digs&quot;, a show in which he acted as mentor to young aspiring filmmakers, for TVtropolis, and &quot;Another Crappy Canadian Late Night Talk Show&quot; for CHCH. In 2007, Digs launched &quot;What the Digs&quot;, a mash-up style show which consisted of Digs&#x27; previous shows reedited in a surreal manner. Following this, Digs created &quot;Late Night Television with JR Digs&quot; which ran for one season.

&quot;Man with a Van&quot;, in which Digs travelled around Canada in a van, was launched in 2008. The show was cancelled by Global in 2014. During this time, Digs also created &quot;Bands from a Van&quot;, a spinoff of his Man with a Van show which focused on musicians. Digs would interview bands and have them perform - all inside his van.

Digs continues to organize an annual Christmas charity benefit show in Hamilton. The 2015 show included Spencer Rice of &quot;Kenny vs. Spenny&quot;, Max Kerman of Arkells, Terra Lightfoot, Tom Wilson, Mike Trebilcock from Killjoys, Elliott Brood and The Trews, while the 2016 show included Lightfoot, Kerman, Trebilcock and Wayne Petti of Cuff the Duke. In 2017, the 9th annual Christmas charity show included appearances from Max Kerman, Tom Wilson, The Dirty Nil, and Monster Truck. The 2018 event is taking place on December 23, 2018 at New Vision United Church in Hamilton.

== Awards and nominations ==
Digs received a Gemini Award nomination for Best Host in a Lifestyle Series in 2006 for &quot;Be Real&quot;, and &quot;Man with a Van&quot; was nominated for Best Talk Show in 2011.

<doc id="425808" wikidata="Q7888079" url="?curid=425808" title="United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1985">
<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1985 with the song &quot;Love Is...&quot;, written by Jimmy Kaleth and Vikki Watson, and performed by Vikki herself. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final.

==Before Eurovision==
=== &quot;A Song for Europe 1985&quot; ===
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) held the national final, &quot;A Song for Europe 1985&quot;, on 9 April 1985 at Studio 1 of the BBC Television Centre in London, hosted by a suited Terry Wogan. The theme music (as it has been in previous years) was Te Deum. The BBC Concert Orchestra under the direction of John Coleman as conductor accompanied all the songs, but despite performing live, the orchestra was off-screen, behind the set. 

In all, 333 songs were originally submitted to the Music Publisher&#x27;s Association, with 8 songs chosen. Songwriters could only submit a maximum of two songs to the MPA, but the identity of the writers was not disclosed to the MPA judges. Due to the poor reception of the British entry in the previous year&#x27;s Eurovision Song Contest, the BBC wanted to revert to the method used to select its entry used in 1964–1975 and approached both Bonnie Tyler and when she was unavailable, Lena Zavaroni to represent the United Kingdom and perform all the shortlisted songs in the national final. The MPA rebuffed the BBC&#x27;s concept, wanting the composers and authors the option of choosing their own performers. A compromise rule was introduced, stating that no groups (more than 2 performers) were allowed to take part and writers would be limited to two entries each, however this rule was only in place for this one year. The songs were selected by around 90 people, DJs, producers and publishers.

Notable songwriters and performers included Paul Curtis who had had entries in the Eurovision final as well as a large number of previous entries in various British national finals, including writing the winning song in . Despite the rule limiting song-writers to two entries, both his songs written with Graham Sacher reached the final eight. Together, Curtis and Sacher had won the &#x27; contest. 1970s glam rock singer Alvin Stardust (who had recently enjoyed a comeback in the charts) appeared as a performer as did Fiona Kennedy who was at the time a presenter of &quot;Record Breakers&quot;. Annabel was Annabel Layton who competed at &#x27; contest as part of Unity. Des Dyer had been the lead singer of the group &#x27;Casablanca&#x27; who&#x27;d placed 3rd in the &quot;&quot; contest. He would later be one of the British backing singers at the Eurovision Song Contest 1988.

==== Final ====
The show opened with a group of dancers, dancing to old Eurovision songs: &quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot;, &quot;Waterloo&quot;, &quot;Puppet on a String&quot;, &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot;, &quot;Boom Bang-a-Bang&quot;, and &quot;Congratulations&quot;. The artists were introduced on stage with captions on screen, followed by presenter Terry Wogan. The songs had been first previewed in the previous week on the &quot;Wogan&quot; television show.

Nine regional juries located in Birmingham, Cardiff, Manchester, Belfast, Glasgow, London, Norwich, Plymouth and Bristol voted for the songs. Each jury region awarded 15, 12, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6 and 5 points to the songs.

== At Eurovision ==
&quot;Love Is...&quot; performed by Vikki finished in fourth place, gaining 100 points overall, at the Eurovision Song Contest 1985. Although the song did not receive any country&#x27;s twelve points, it still managed to score with every jury but one (Cyprus). The British jury awarded their twelve points to the eventual winners, Norway&#x27;s &quot;La det swinge&quot; by Bobbysocks!.

The final was broadcast on BBC 1 with Terry Wogan providing the commentary, Wogan actually commentated from BBC TV Centre in London as he was suffering from flu and was unable to fly to Gothenburg. BBC Radio 2 again decided not to broadcast the contest, but the contest was broadcast on British Forces Radio with commentary provided by Richard Nankivell. The BBC appointed Colin Berry as its spokesperson to announce the British jury vote.

<text>Luis Manuel Fernández de Portocarrero y de Guzmán, (8 January 1635, Palma del Río – 14 September 1709, Toledo, Spain) was a Spanish prelate, who was cardinal archbishop of Toledo. Uncle of Luis Antonio Tomás de Portocarrero y Moscoso, 5th Count, who became a Grandee of Spain, 2nd class, since 1707 by King Felipe V of Spain.

==Biography==

A younger son of the 1st marquis of Almenara, title of 11 July 1623, and 3rd Count of Palma del Rio, title of 22 November 1507, Luis Andres. He became dean of Toledo early, and was made cardinal on 5 August 1669.

Till 1677 he lived at Rome as cardinal protector of the Spanish nation. In 1677 he was appointed interim viceroy of Sicily, counsellor of state and archbishop of Toledo. He ceased to be viceroy of Sicily in 1678, being replaced by Vicente de Gonzaga y Doria, (1602–1694) former Viceroy of Catalonia, 1664–1667, not to be confounded with his nephew Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Guastalla, (1634–1714). On 16 January 1678, he was consecrated bishop by Jaime de Palafox y Cardona, Archbishop of Palermo, with Giovanni Roano e Corrionero, Archbishop of Monreale, and Francesco Arata, Bishop of Lipari, serving as co-consecrators. As archbishop of Toledo he exerted himself to protect the clergy from the obligation to pay the excises or octroi duties known as &quot;the millions&quot; and thereby helped to perpetuate the financial embarrassments of the government.

His position rather than any personal qualities enabled him to play an important part in a great crisis of European politics. The decrepit King Charles II was childless, and the disposal of his inheritance became a question of great interest to the European powers. Fernández de Portocarrero was induced to become a supporter of the French party, which desired that the crown should be left to one of the family of Louis XIV, and not to a member of the king&#x27;s own family, the Habsburgs. The great authority of Fernández de Portocarrero as cardinal and primate of Spain was used to persuade, or rather to terrify the unhappy king into making a will in favor of the duke of Anjou, Philip V.

He acted as regent until the new king reached Spain and hoped to be powerful under his rule. But the king&#x27;s French advisers were aware that Spain required a thorough financial and administrative reform. Fernández de Portocarrero could not see, and indeed had not either the intelligence or the honesty to see, the necessity. He was incapable, obstinate and perfectly selfish. The new rulers soon found that he must be removed and he was ordered to return to his diocese. When in 1706 the Austrian party appeared likely to gain the upper hand, Fernández de Portocarrero was led by spite and vexation to go over to them.

When fortune changed he returned to his allegiance to Philip V, and as the government was unwilling to offend the Church he escaped banishment. In 1709 when Louis XIV made a pretence of withdrawing from the support of his grandson, the cardinal made a great display of loyalty. He died in September of the same year and by his orders the words &quot;Hic jacet pulvis, cinis, et nihil&quot; were put on his tomb (here lies dust, ashes and nothing).

<doc id="425813" wikidata="Q5048623" url="?curid=425813" title="Cash-for-questions affair">
<text>The cash-for-questions affair was a political scandal of the 1990s in the United Kingdom.

It began in October 1994 when &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper alleged that London&#x27;s most successful parliamentary lobbyist, Ian Greer of Ian Greer Associates, had bribed two Conservative Members of Parliament to ask parliamentary questions and perform other tasks on behalf of the Egyptian owner of Harrods department store, Mohamed Al-Fayed.

==Overview==
&quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s report alleged that Al-Fayed had approached the paper and accused Ian Greer of paying then-MPs Neil Hamilton and Tim Smith to table parliamentary questions on his behalf at £2,000 a time. Smith resigned immediately after admitting to accepting payments from Al-Fayed himself, but not from Greer as &quot;The Guardian&quot; had alleged.

Hamilton and Greer immediately issued libel writs in the High Court against &quot;The Guardian&quot; to clear their names.

The furor prompted the then-prime minister John Major to instigate the Nolan Committee, to review the issue of standards in public life.

Six weeks later in December 1994, in a private letter to the chairman of the parliamentary watchdog the Members&#x27; Interests Committee, Mohamed Al-Fayed alleged that he had paid Hamilton, in addition to the original allegations that Ian Greer was the paymaster. Hamilton denied this new allegation.

The Defamation Act 1996 was designed to alter the Bill of Rights 1689, and allows an MP to waive parliamentary privilege. This would have permitted Hamilton to give evidence in court concerning statements he made in the House of Commons.

Two years later, at the end of September 1996, three days before Hamilton&#x27;s and Greer&#x27;s libel actions were due to start, three of Mohamed Al-Fayed&#x27;s employees claimed that they had processed cash payments to the two men. Hamilton and Greer denied these new allegations.

Hamilton and Greer withdrew their libel action on 30 September 1996.

Hamilton&#x27;s and Greer&#x27;s withdrawal of their libel actions provoked an avalanche of condemnation of the two men in the British press, led by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Parliament initiated an official inquiry into the affair, to be led by Sir Gordon Downey.

In December 1996, Ian Greer&#x27;s lobbying company collapsed.

Downey began his inquiry in early 1997, but before he published his report Prime Minister John Major prorogued Parliament for a general election, to be held on 1 May 1997.

Smith resigned from Parliament on 25 March, and stood down in the general election.

In the election, former BBC reporter Martin Bell stood in Hamilton&#x27;s Cheshire constituency of Tatton as an independent candidate on an &quot;anti-corruption&quot; platform. Bell easily defeated Hamilton with the assistance of the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, who both withdrew their candidates and supplied party workers to help Bell&#x27;s campaign.

Sir Gordon Downey published his 900-page report in early July 1997, clearing Ian Greer, Neil Hamilton, and Tim Smith of &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s original allegations that Ian Greer had paid the two MPs to table questions. However, Downey decreed that the three Fayed employees&#x27; testimony that they had processed cash payments to Hamilton amounted to &quot;compelling evidence&quot;, though he did not accept their claims to have processed cash payments to the lobbyist Greer.

At the same time, the Standards and Privileges Committee published its conclusions in relation to complaints made by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and Mohamed Al Fayed, which concluded:

===Standard and Privileges Committee Report===
====Michael Brown====
====Sir Peter Hordern====
====Sir Andrew Bowden====
====Sir Michael Grylls====

====Mr Tim Smith====
== &quot;Hamilton v Al-Fayed&quot; ==

In 1998 Neil Hamilton issued a writ for libel against Mohamed al-Fayed, over allegations that Al-Fayed had made on a Channel 4 documentary programme broadcast in January 1997. In late 1999 the trial began at the High Court. Hamilton lost and was ordered to pay costs.

In late 2000, Hamilton&#x27;s appeal was heard at the Court of Appeal. The three judges dismissed Hamilton&#x27;s appeal on the grounds that Fayed&#x27;s acquisition of the stolen papers would not have materially affected the outcome of the trial.

In 2001 Neil Hamilton declared bankruptcy.

== Riddick and Treddinick ==
Though the term &quot;cash for questions affair&quot; is used to refer to the events that followed the publication of &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s story, it was not the first time that a British newspaper had accused MPs of taking bribes to table questions. Three months earlier, in July 1994, a &#x27;sting&#x27; operation by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that two Conservative MPs Graham Riddick and David Treddinick had accepted cheques for £1,000 for agreeing to table a parliamentary question.

The two were suspended from parliament for 10 and 20 days respectively, Mr Riddick receiving a shorter &#x27;sentence&#x27; due to his apparent decision to apologise quickly and return his cheque bribe.

Riddick lodged a formal complaint with the Press Complaints Commission (PCC). Basing its decisions on the information compiled by the Commons&#x27; Privileges Committee the PCC found in Riddick&#x27;s favour. The commission judged that &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; failed to make clear to its readers that its approach to Riddick had been on the basis of a legitimate consultancy, not on the basis of a one-off payment in return for asking a question and that there was no justification for the newspaper&#x27;s resort to subterfuge. This overturned a ruling two years earlier by the PCC in favour of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; when Riddick had been unaware that the PCC was investigating the matter. The PCC apologised to Riddick for &#x27;this serious breach of our procedures.&#x27;

<doc id="425814" wikidata="Q7888080" url="?curid=425814" title="United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1986">
<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1986 with the song &quot;Runner in the Night&quot;, composed by Brian Wade, with lyrics by Maureen Darbyshire, and performed by the group Ryder. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final.

==Before Eurovision==
=== &quot;A Song for Europe 1986&quot; ===
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) held the national final, &quot;A Song for Europe 1986&quot;, on 2 April 1986 at Studio 1 of the BBC Television Centre in London, hosted by Terry Wogan. The BBC Concert Orchestra under the direction of Ronnie Hazlehurst as conductor accompanied all but the winning song, but despite performing live, the orchestra were off-screen, behind the set. The rule introduced for 1984 prohibiting groups or &#x27;made for Eurovision&#x27; acts from participating was rescinded. In total, 335 entries where received, and reduced tot the final eight by a variety of music industry experts.

Lead singer of the group &#x27;Palace&#x27; was Michael Palace, previously known as Dan Duskey. Duskey had represented as one of &#x27;The Duskeys&#x27; and thus became the first Eurovision artist to have taken part in the contest for another country, before attempting to represent the UK. The group &#x27;Jump&#x27; were led by Peter Beckett and David Ian. Beckett had taken part in the previous &quot;&quot; and Ian had been a member of the group &#x27;First Division&#x27; in , as David Lane. &#x27;Jump&#x27;s&#x27; song was written by perennial UK songwriter Paul Curtis, his 19th UK finalist.

The show was opened by 1985&#x27;s Eurovision winners, Bobbysocks, who sang &quot;Let It Swing&quot;, the English-language version of their winning song &quot;La det swinge&quot;. They were joined onstage by a large number of backing dancers, choreographed by Anthony van Laast. The duo were also going to sing their brand new single &quot;Waiting for the Morning&quot;, but the producers finally decided to cancel that part of the plan and instead, the two members of the group were interviewed by Terry Wogan during the interval.

The result was determined by 11 regional juries located in Leeds, Newcastle, Plymouth, Birmingham, Cardiff, Manchester, Belfast, Glasgow, London, Norwich and Bristol. Each jury region awarded 15, 12, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, and 5 points to the songs. The scoreboard, due to a technical issue, was incorrectly adjusted during the broadcast and the final tallies shown on screen did not correspond with the scores announced on air.

The winning entry was &quot;Runner in the Night&quot;, performed by the sextet Ryder, composed by Brian Wade, with lyrics written by Maureen Darbyshire.

<doc id="425815" wikidata="Q286118" url="?curid=425815" title="Philip Stanhope, 5th Earl Stanhope">
<text>Philip Henry Stanhope, 5th Earl Stanhope, (30 January 180524 December 1875), styled Viscount Mahon between 1816 and 1855, was an English antiquarian and Tory politician. He held political office under Sir Robert Peel in the 1830s and 1840s but is best remembered for his contributions to cultural causes and for his historical writings.

==Background and education==
Born at Walmer, Kent, Stanhope was the son of Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl Stanhope, and the Hon. Catherine Stanhope, daughter of Robert Smith, 1st Baron Carrington. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, graduating in 1827.

==Political career==
Stanhope entered Parliament in 1830, representing the rotten borough of Wootton Basset in Wiltshire until the seat was disenfranchised in 1832. He was then re-elected to Parliament representing Hertford. He served under Sir Robert Peel as Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs between December 1834 and April 1835, and Secretary to the Board of Control in 1845, but though he remained in the House of Commons till 1852, he made no special mark in politics.

He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1854.

==Contributions to culture==
Stanhope&#x27;s chief achievements were in the fields of literature and antiquities. In 1842 took a prominent part in passing the Literary Copyright Act 1842. From the House of Lords he was mainly responsible for proposing and organising the foundation of the National Portrait Gallery, London in 1856. A sculpted bust of Stanhope holds the central place over the entrance of the building, flanked by fellow historians and supporters Thomas Carlyle and Lord Macaulay. It was mainly due to him that in 1869 the Historical Manuscripts Commission was started. As president of the Society of Antiquaries (from 1846 onwards), he called attention in England to the need of supporting the excavations at Troy. He was also president of the Royal Literary Fund from 1863 until his death, a trustee of the British Museum and founded the Stanhope essay prize at Oxford in 1855. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1827.

==Writings==
Of Lord Stanhope&#x27;s own works, the most important were:
* &quot;Life of Belisarius&quot; (1829);
* &quot;History of the War of the Succession in Spain&quot; (1832), largely based on the James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope&#x27;s papers; 
*&quot;History of England from the Peace of Utrecht to the Peace of Versailles, 1713–1783&quot; (7 vols.) (1836–1853);
*&quot;Life of the Right Honourable William Pitt&quot; (4 vols.) (1861–1862);
*&quot;The Reign of Queen Anne until the Peace of Utrecht, 1701–1713&quot; (1870, reprinted 1908);
*&quot;Notes of Conversation with the Duke of Wellington, 1831–1851&quot; (1886, reprinted 1998)

A further little work was &quot;The Forty-Five&quot; a narrative of the Jacobite rising of 1745 extracted from his &quot;History of England.&quot; A new edition of this work was published in London by John Murray, Albemarle St., in 1869, which includes some letters of Prince Charles Edward Stuart.

The two histories and the &quot;Life of William Pitt&quot; were considered of great importance on account of Stanhope&#x27;s unique access to manuscript authorities on Pitt the Elder&#x27;s life. His records of the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s remarks during his frequent visits were also considered of great use to the historian as a substitute for Wellington&#x27;s never-written memoirs. They were secretly transcribed because of Wellington&#x27;s famous antagonism to the &quot;truth&quot; of recollected history. He also edited the letters that his distant cousin, Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield, had written to his natural son, Philip. They were published between 1845 and 1853.

Stanhope&#x27;s position as an historian was already established when he succeeded to the earldom in 1855, and in 1872 he was made an honorary associate of the Institute of France.

==Family==
Lord Stanhope married Emily Harriet Kerrison, daughter of General Sir Edward Kerrison, 1st Baronet, in 1834. She died in December 1873. They had four sons and one daughter:
*Arthur Stanhope, 6th Earl Stanhope (1838–1905)
*Hon. Edward Stanhope (1840–1893), a well-known Conservative politician
*Lady Mary Catharine Stanhope (3 February 184430 June 1876), married Frederick Lygon, 6th Earl Beauchamp, and had issue
*Hon. Henry Augustus Stanhope (4 December 184517 June 1933), married Hon. Mildred Vernon (died 1915) and had issue
*Philip Stanhope, 1st Baron Weardale (1847–1923)

Stanhope survived her by two years and died at Merivale, Bournemouth, Hampshire, in December 1875, aged 70. He was succeeded in the earldom by his eldest son, Arthur.

<doc id="425816" wikidata="Q1157204" url="?curid=425816" title="Dagenham East tube station">
<text>Dagenham East () is a London Underground station located on the eastern side of the town of Dagenham in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, east London. It is on the District line between Dagenham Heathway and Elm Park stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 5. It is along the line from the eastern terminus at and to in central London where the line divides into numerous branches. The station has moderate usage for a suburban station, with approximately 3 million exits/entrances per year.

It was opened as a main line station in 1885 and was called Dagenham. The current station buildings date from the introduction of electric services in 1932 and of typical railway architectural style for the period, with little trace remaining of the station&#x27;s Victorian origins. In 2006 the station was extensively refurbished by Metronet.

==History==

The station was initially opened as a main line station on the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway in 1885, on a new branch connecting London with Southend by a more direct route than the existing service via Rainham. The new station was opened as &quot;Dagenham&quot;, with the main station buildings on the up platform, which is now disused. From 1902 to 1905 the station was served by trains of the District Railway, who connected to the main line at a junction at Bow. The station was in a rural location until the building of the Becontree estate, of which it was on the eastern perimeter.

London, Tilbury and Southend Railway operation passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1912, and in 1932 an additional set of tracks were constructed between Barking and Upminster. The current station structures originate from this period. The new tracks were electrified and permitted the District line to operate as far Upminster for the first time since 1905. An additional station was opened at Heathway in 1932 and Dagenham East was renamed to its current name in 1949. The station was predominantly served by the electric London Underground services and the main line platforms were eventually decommissioned in 1962, when those lines were overhead electrified. After nationalisation of the railways in 1948 management of the station passed to British Railways and in 1969 ownership transferred to the London Underground.

==Design==
The station was refurbished by Metronet in 2006 as part of a series of improvements to the London Underground. These works included the installation of CCTV, provision of customer help points connected to a control room, a new public address system, electronic customer information displays on platforms and in the ticket hall, and the erection of new enclosed waiting areas. Ticket barriers are in operation. The station has three working platforms that are used by the District line, one for each direction of travel and another for terminating trains from central London during peak times.

==Location==
The station serves Eastbrookend Country Park to the east. North of the station is an industrial estate and the Victoria Road stadium. To the south is predominantly residential, including the historic Dagenham village. London Buses routes 103 and 364 serve the station.

==Services==
Dagenham East station is on the eastern part of the District line between Dagenham Heathway to the west and Elm Park to the east. The typical off-peak service from the station is twelve District line trains per hour to Upminster and twelve to Earl&#x27;s Court, of which six continue to Ealing Broadway and six continue to Richmond. At peak periods some trains continue from Earl&#x27;s Court to Wimbledon. Services towards central London operate from approximately 05:00 to 23:45 and services to Upminster operate from approximately 06:00 to 01:30. The journey time to Upminster is ten minutes; to Barking is ten minutes, and to Tower Hill is approximately 34 minutes. During 2011 there were 2.22 million passenger entries and exits at the station, higher than the annual usage over the preceding two years, and typical for a suburban station.

==Railway station proposal==
In 2015, Barking and Dagenham London Borough Council proposed the platforms on the National Rail route should be re-opened to provide interchange with c2c services, in connection with the Barking Riverside redevelopment to the south of the station. In 2022 Barking and Dagenham Council restated its aspirations for the reinstated platforms at Dagenham East as well as a new station at Castle Green.

<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1987 with the song &quot;Only the Light&quot;, written and performed by Rikki. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final.

==Before Eurovision==
=== &quot;A Song for Europe 1987&quot; ===
In a change to previous years, 10 songs were performed instead of the usual eight. None of the performers had ever performed in &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; before, and none of the writers had ever written for the contest before. As well as Music Publisher&#x27;s Association selecting some of the songs, songs from record publishers were also submitted. They were selected in the following manner (as recounted by the radio commentator during the interval act): &quot;Around 400 songs were selected by the Music Publisher&#x27;s Association and the British Phonographic Industries. These songs were reviewed by 10 juries of 6 people, whittling them down to 50 songs. They were down reduced to 20 songs, which were sent to the BBC, and the 10 were chosen by producer Brian Whitehouse, Mike Batt, Bruce Welch, some radio and television producers, and representatives from the MPA and BPI&quot;. The interval act was a pre-recorded dancing performance by The Anthony Van Laast Dancers.

==== Final ====
The final was held on 10 April 1987, live from Studio 1 of the BBC Television Centre in London. The contest was hosted by Terry Wogan. It was also broadcast on BBC Radio 2, and this was the first and only instance in which the radio commentator could also be heard on television, passing comment after each song, and during the interval act. The BBC Concert Orchestra under the direction of Ronnie Hazlehurst as conductor accompanied all the songs, but despite performing live, the orchestra were off-screen, behind the set. Hazlehurst&#x27;s arrangement of the title music which had made its debut the previous year, was an upbeat arrangement of the traditional Te Deum music and was used again for the title sequence.

Nine regional juries located in Birmingham, Cardiff, Manchester, Belfast, Edinburgh, London, Norwich, Newcastle, and Bristol voted for the songs. Juries ranked the songs internally and awarded 15 points to their favourite, 12 to the second, 10 to the third, 9 to the fourth, 8 to the fifth, 7 to the sixth, 6 to the seventh, 5 to the eighth, 3 to the ninth and 1 to their least preferred.

<doc id="425823" wikidata="Q260575" url="?curid=425823" title="Alice Bailey">
<text>Alice Ann Bailey (16 June 1880 – 15 December 1949) was an author of about 25 books on Theosophy and among the first writers to use the term New Age. She was born Alice La Trobe-Bateman, in Manchester, England and moved to the United States in 1907, where she spent most of her life as a writer and teacher.

Bailey&#x27;s works, written between 1919 and 1949, describe a wide-ranging neo-theosophical system of esoteric thought covering such topics as how spirituality relates to the Solar System, meditation, healing, spiritual psychology, the destiny of nations, and prescriptions for society in general. She described the majority of her work as having been telepathically dictated to her by a Master of Wisdom, initially referred to only as &quot;the Tibetan&quot; or by the initials &quot;D.K.&quot;, later identified as Djwal Khul. Her writings bore some similarity to those of Madame Blavatsky and are among the teachings often referred to as &quot;Ageless Wisdom&quot;. Though Bailey&#x27;s writings differ in some respects from the Theosophy of Blavatsky, they have much in common with it. She wrote on religious themes, including Christianity, though her writings are fundamentally different from many aspects of Christianity or other orthodox religions. Her vision of a unified society included a global &quot;spirit of religion&quot; different from traditional religious forms and including the concept of the Age of Aquarius.

== Biography ==

=== Childhood and early life ===
Bailey was born into a wealthy middle-class British family and, as a member of the Anglican Church, received a thorough Christian education.

Her autobiography states that at the age of 15, on 30 June 1895, Bailey was visited by a stranger, &quot;...a tall man, dressed in European clothes and wearing a turban&quot; who told her she needed to develop self-control to prepare for certain work he planned for her to do. This turned out to be the creation and publication of 19 books, together with educational and meditation work that reached &quot;practically all the countries of the world&quot;.

At the age of 22, Bailey did evangelical work in connection with the YMCA and the British Army. This took her to India, where, in 1907, she met her future husband, Walter Evans. Together, they moved to America, where Evans became an Episcopal priest. The marriage did not last, and Bailey pushed for and received a divorce. She left with their three children after their formal separation in 1915. Then followed a difficult period in which she worked in a sardine cannery to support herself and the children.

=== With the Theosophical Society ===

Bailey discovered the Theosophical Society and the work of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky. The Theosophical Society states that Bailey became involved in 1917. Theosophist Joy Mills states that in 1918 she became a member of the Esoteric Section of the society. Theosophist Bruce F. Campbell notes, &quot;She quickly rose to a position of influence in the American Section of the Adyar society, moving to its headquarters at Krotona in Hollywood. She became editor of its magazine, &quot;The Messenger,&quot; and member of the committee responsible for Krotona.&quot; In 1919, Foster Bailey (1888–1977), who was to be her second husband, became National Secretary of the Theosophical Society. They married in 1921.

The Theosophist published the first few chapters of her first work, &quot;Initiation, Human and Solar,&quot; (p. 762) but then stopped for reasons Bailey called &quot;theosophical jealousy and reactionary attitude&quot;. Bailey &quot;objected to the &#x27;neo-Theosophy&#x27; of Annie Besant&quot; and worked with Foster Bailey to gain more power in the American Section. According to Theosophist Josephine Maria Davies Ransom, she became part of a progressive &quot;Back to Blavatsky movement, led mainly by Mr. and Mrs. Foster Bailey&quot;. She outlined her vision for the Esoteric Section of the Theosophical Society; however, her efforts to influence the society failed, and she and her husband were dismissed from their positions.

According to historian of religion Olav Hammer, Bailey&#x27;s early writings on communications with the Tibetan were well received within the society, but society president Annie Besant questioned Bailey&#x27;s claims of communications with &quot;the Tibetan&quot; and allowed the Baileys to be expelled from the organization. According to Bailey, she had come to see the society as authoritarian and involved with &quot;lower psychic phenomena&quot;.

=== Lucis Trust ===

Alice and Foster Bailey founded the Lucis Trust in 1922. Its activities include the Arcane School, World Goodwill, Triangles, a quarterly magazine called The Beacon, and a publishing company primarily intended to publish Bailey&#x27;s many books. The Arcane School gives instruction and guidance in meditation via correspondence based on the ideas in Bailey&#x27;s books. World Goodwill is intended to promote better human relations through goodwill, which they define as &quot;love in action&quot;. That &quot;action&quot; included the support of the United Nations. The &quot;Triangles&quot; are groups of three people who agree to link up in thought each day and to meditate on right human relations, visualizing light and love pouring into human minds and hearts, followed by the use of the Great Invocation. It is not necessary for each person to link in thought at the same time each day and it only takes a few moments of time.
Alice and Foster Bailey founded &quot;Lucifer Publishing Company&quot; (&quot;&#x27;Lucifer&#x27; and &#x27;Lucis&#x27; come from the same word root, &quot;lucis&quot; being the Latin genitive case meaning &quot;of light&quot;). After the first two or three years, the name was changed to &quot;Lucis Publishing Co.&quot; (The Theosophical Society also used the name &quot;Lucifer&quot; for its early magazine.) In 1923, with the help of Foster Bailey, Alice Bailey founded the Arcane School, which is part of Lucis Trust. This school provides educational correspondence, meditation instruction, and guided study based on her writings.

Bailey continued to work up until the time of her death in 1949.

== Main ideas ==

=== The seven rays of energy ===
Bailey&#x27;s writings includes a detailed exposition of the &quot;seven rays&quot; which are presented as the fundamental energies that are behind and exist throughout all manifestation. They are seen as the basic creative forces of the universe and emanations of Divinity that underlie the evolution of all things. The rays are described as related to human psychology, the destiny of nations, as well as the planets and stars of the heavens. The concept of the seven rays can be found in Theosophical works. Campbell writes that Bailey, &quot;...was the first to develop the idea of the seven rays, although it can be found in germ in earlier Theosophical writings.&quot; The seven rays also appear in Hindu religious philosophy.

=== Esoteric astrology ===

Esoteric astrology is part of Alice Bailey&#x27;s &quot;Ageless Wisdom&quot; teachings, which she said were relayed by her Tibetan Master Djwhal Khul.

The esoteric astrologers who follow the teachings of Bailey typically base their work on her five-volume &quot;Treatise on the Seven Rays&quot;, particularly volume three which focuses on astrology. Her esoteric astrology deals with the evolution of soul consciousness and the obstacles to that evolution.

=== Esoteric healing ===
Bailey&#x27;s teaching on healing primarily concerns the relationship of soul to personality, of the spiritual to the material nature. In her view, all disease has its ultimate root in some type of blocked or inhibited soul life. Therefore, healing consists of releasing the soul, that is the establishing of a right relation between the soul and the personality where the personality is defined as the instrument of soul expression. Eliminating obstructions and congestion, the source of a major part of disease. The whole process of healing is directed by thought, the mind of the healer and sometimes emotional synergy to inhibit causes of disease. Healing becomes automatic where the practitioner no longer is directed by energies, currents, centers, that include the nadis as one area of focus, the abstract is related back to the practices where appropriate but healing is directed without effort.

=== The constitution of man ===
In line with previous Theosophical teachings, Bailey taught that man consists of
# Monad (spark of God, true Self)
# Soul (higher mind, Love nature, higher consciousness)
# Personality consisting of three aspects
#* Lower mind (intellect)
#* Emotions or astral nature
#* Physical and etheric body

Each of the three aspects of the lower nature is described as a &quot;body&quot; or aura of energy and seen as partial expression of the real self or soul. The soul is regarded as the reflection of the real self that works through or uses the three aspects of personality. She also speaks of these as &quot;vehicles&quot; or &quot;sheaths&quot;, and alternately as the &quot;mental body&quot;, &quot;astral body&quot;, or &quot;physical body&quot;. The &quot;etheric&quot; body is most directly related to physical health and is seen as the vital energizing agent for the individual while in physical incarnation. (p. 172) (p. 33) See also: Subtle body. The mind and emotional nature are seen as auras. or energy fields of which brain activity is a secondary effect. (p. 411)

=== The Great Invocation ===
The Great Invocation is a mantra given in 1937 by Bailey. The mantra begins with &quot;From the point of Light within the Mind of God, let light stream forth into the minds of men...&quot; with the rest of the passage expressing the ideas of love, the return of The Christ (Maitreya) and of men acting in accordance with the plan of God.

It is well known by some followers of the New Age movement, where it is widely used as part of meditation, particularly in groups. For instance, the invocation has been used in the Findhorn Foundation community since the 1970s. In response to the September 11 attacks (2001), the Great Invocation was used as a central element of a new daily program at Findhorn known as the &quot;Network of Light meditations for peace&quot;. Rosemary Keller described the Great Invocation as a call for &quot;the Christ to return to Earth&quot; and wrote that Bailey-related groups purchased radio and television time to broadcast the invocation as part of their mission, and that often the invocation was recited in what Keller called &quot;light groups&quot;, to accomplish what Bailey&#x27;s disciples considered to be attracting and focusing &quot;spiritual energies to benefit the planet&quot;.

Alice Bailey&#x27;s writings have a theme that generally advocates replacement of the old with the new and this occurs in connection with the Great Invocation as follows: &quot;This new Invocation, if given widespread distribution, can be to the new world religion what the Lord&#x27;s Prayer has been to Christianity and the 23rd Psalm has been to the spiritually minded Jew.&quot;

=== Discipleship and service ===
Bailey&#x27;s writings downplayed traditional devotional and religious aspects of the spiritual life, in favor of a life of meditation, service to humanity, and cooperation with &quot;the Plan of the Hierarchy&quot;. In her thinking, service, &quot;...is a soul instinct ... innate and peculiar to soul unfoldment. It is the outstanding characteristic of the soul, just as desire is the outstanding characteristic of the lower nature...&quot;

=== Unity and divinity of nations and groups ===
Ross describes Bailey&#x27;s teachings as emphasizing the &quot;underlying unity of all forms of life&quot;, and the &quot;essential oneness of all religions, of all departments of science, and of all the philosophies&quot;. Campbell notes that the New Group of World Servers was established for &quot;...promotion of international understanding, economic sharing, and religious unity&quot;.

=== Comparison with Theosophy ===
Theosophists are divided on their assessment of Alice Bailey&#x27;s writings. For instance, the noted contemporary Theosophical writer Geoffrey Hodson wrote a highly favorable review of one her books, saying, &quot;Once more Alice Bailey has placed occult students in her debt.&quot; Olav Hammer writes, &quot;Her first book, &quot;Initiation Human and Solar,&quot; was at first favorably received by her fellow theosophists. Soon, however, her claims to be recipient of ageless wisdom from the Masters met with opposition.&quot; The conflict is understandable since her works contain some criticisms of Theosophy, and at the time of the break she voiced her criticism of what she saw as dogmatic structures within the society, while questioning the pledges of loyalty to Theosophical leaders that were required. &quot;During the annual convention of 1920 in Chicago, there was a power struggle between forces loyal to Besant and the Esoteric Section and others who believed that the latter had become too powerful. Below the surface was a hidden controversy regarding Alice&#x27;s work with the Tibetan.&quot; For a more recent example of Bailey/Theosophy division, see Theosophy in Scandinavia.

Campbell writes that Bailey&#x27;s books are a reworking of major Theosophical themes, with some distinctive emphases, and that they present a comprehensive system of esoteric science and occult philosophy, cognizant of contemporary social and political developments. Steven J. Sutcliffe points out that both Bailey and Blavatsky&#x27;s work evoke a picture of Tibet as the spiritual home of the Masters and that Bailey claimed a more-or-less direct lineage to Blavatsky. He describes Bailey as a &#x27;post-Theosophical&#x27; theorist, reporting that Bailey received instruction from &quot;former personal pupils of Blavatsky&quot; and notes that her third book (&quot;A Treatise on Cosmic Fire&quot;) not only reproduces Blavatsky&#x27;s apocryphal Stanzas of Dzyan but is dedicated to Blavatsky, as well.

Parallels between Theosophy and Bailey are many, for instance, one principle of Theosophy, the Law of Attraction was discussed in esoteric writings by Blavatsky, Annie Besant, William Quan Judge, and others; and was also discussed in the writings of Alice Bailey, including a whole chapter in one of her books. The term has been embraced, in a simplified form, by the contemporary New Age movement and was popularized in the 2006 film &quot;The Secret&quot;.

Jon Klimo, in &quot;Investigations on Receiving Information from Paranormal Sources&quot;, writes, &quot;As with Blavatsky/Theosophical material, and more recent contemporary channeled material from other sources, we find in the Bailey work the same occult cosmological hierarchy: physical, etheric, astral, mental, causal, and higher inhabited levels of existence.&quot; Olav Hammer, in the book &quot;Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age&quot;, highlights Bailey&#x27;s Theosophical similarities as well as noting what he thinks are some differences between them: &quot;To a large extent, Bailey&#x27;s teachings are a restatement and amplification of theosophy of the &quot;Secret Doctrine.&quot; Bailey inherited from Blavatsky and Leadbeater a predilection for profuse details and complex classificatory schemes. ... Her books have also introduced shifts in emphasis as well as new doctrinal elements.&quot;

Some Theosophical critics have contended that there are major differences between Bailey&#x27;s ideas and the Theosophy of Blavatsky, such as Bailey&#x27;s embrace of some mystical Christian terms and concepts and her acceptance of Charles Webster Leadbeater.

Nicholas Weeks, writing for the Theosophical magazine &quot;Fohat&quot; in 1997, felt Bailey&#x27;s assertion that &quot;...her teachings are grounded in and do not oppose in any fundamental way Theosophy as lived and taught by HPB and her Gurus&quot; was false. Her books are in fact &quot;rooted in the pseudo-theosophy pioneered by C. W. Leadbeater.&quot; He stated Bailey accepted Leadbeater&#x27;s &quot;fantasy&quot; of the return of Christ and disparaged Bailey&#x27;s &quot;Great Invocation&quot;, a prayer supposed to &quot;induce Christ and his Masters to leave their hidden ashrams [and] enter into major cities&quot; to lead the Aquarian Age. This contrasts with the Theosophy of Blavatsky, he says, which emphasizes reliance on &quot;the Christos principle within each person&quot;.

=== Ideas about races and evolution ===
Bailey described a concept of racial differentiation that posited a division of humanity into races that are on different levels in a &quot;ladder of evolution&quot;. These &#x27;&quot;races&quot; do not represent a national or physical type but a stage of evolution. For example, she states that the Aryan root race (or &#x27;5th race&#x27;), is an &quot;emerging new race&quot; and so a relatively new evolutionary phenomenon. She stated that this newer type is forming in every land but primarily in lands where Caucasian peoples are found and indicates a culture where thought or intellect is dominant. She stated that as evolution proceeds, things are accelerated and humanity will soon be predominantly distinguished by the Aryan consciousness. &quot;I speak not in terms of the Aryan race as it is generally understood today or in its Nordic implications.&quot;

In her book &quot;Education in the New Age&quot;, Bailey made predictions about the use of this esoteric racial concept in the schools of the future and that these schools would incorporate the idea of &quot;root races&quot;. These &quot;races&quot; are a way of conceptualizing evolution as it occurs over vast prehistoric spans of time, and during which humanity developed body (Lemurian), emotion (Atlantean), and mind (Aryan). She states that there is now being developed a &quot;new race&quot; with a spiritual dimension that expresses as &quot;group qualities and consciousness and idealistic vision&quot;. She stated that this new development may take many thousands of years and may therefore not be the quick advance some of her New Age followers wish for. In her &quot;The Destiny of the Nations&quot;, Bailey described a process by which this &quot;new race&quot; will evolve, after which &quot;very low grade human bodies will disappear, causing a general shift in the racial types toward a higher standard.&quot; For Bailey, the evolution of humanity was intimately bound up with its relationship to this Spiritual Hierarchy. She believed that the influences of religions, philosophies, sciences, educational movements, and human culture in general are the result of this relationship.

==== Criticism of her ideas on races ====
Bailey&#x27;s ideas about race were criticized by Victor Shnirelman, a cultural anthropologist and ethnographer, who in a survey of modern Neopaganism in Russia, drew particular attention to &quot;...groups [that] take an extremely negative view of multi-culturalism, object to the &#x27;mixture&#x27; of kinds, [and] support isolationism and the prohibition of immigration.&quot; Shnirelman saw some of Bailey&#x27;s ideas on race as similar to the racism he perceived in the writing of Julius Evola, saying that &quot;...racist and antisemitic trends are explicit, for example, in the occult teachings of Alice Bailey and her followers, who wish to cleanse Christianity of its &quot;Jewish inheritance&quot; and reject the &quot;Jewish Bible&quot; as a prerequisite for entering the Age of Aquarius.&quot;

Shnirelman&#x27;s view was echoed by Isaac Lubelsky who criticized not only Bailey, but Blavatsky, Steiner, and others. In Lubelsky&#x27;s view, racists ideas were common to the whole &quot;Theosophical family&quot;.

Monica Sjöö, a Swedish painter, writer and a radical anarcho/eco-feminist wrote that Bailey, through her published teachings, had a &quot;reactionary and racist influence on the whole New Age movement.&quot; She also noted what she called Bailey&#x27;s (and Theosophy&#x27;s) &quot;pro-fascist religious views&quot;, such as the belief in a secret elite of &quot;Masters&quot; who influence world events and human minds through occult means and attempt to bring about the evolution of an Aryan race (although this is an understandably modern misunderstanding of her teaching – &#x27;Aryan&#x27; as used by Bailey is easily confused with the modern terminology, and the &quot;Masters&quot; are not an elite, but instead are &#x27;enlightened&#x27; individuals originally introduced in theosophy as having evolved beyond the human or &quot;4th kingdom&quot; into the fifth or &quot;Kingdom of souls&quot;, and who – in her view – guide the human race as a whole).

Controversy has arisen around some of Bailey&#x27;s statements on nationalism, American isolationism, Soviet totalitarianism, Fascism, Zionism, Nazism, race relations, Africans, Jews, and the religions of Judaism and Christianity. Yonassan Gershom and others have claimed that her writings contain racist material.

The American Chassidic author Yonassan Gershom wrote that Bailey&#x27;s plan for a New World Order and her call for &quot;the gradual dissolution—again if in any way possible—of the Orthodox Jewish faith&quot; revealed that &quot;her goal is nothing less than the destruction of Judaism itself.&quot; Gershom also wrote that &quot;This stereotyped portrayal of Jews is followed by a hackneyed diatribe against the Biblical Hebrews, based upon the &quot;angry Jehovah&quot; theology of nineteenth-century Protestantism. Jews do not, and never have, worshipped an angry vengeful god, and we Jews never, ever call God &#x27;Jehovah&#x27;.&quot;

Researcher Hannah Newman described what she found to be an antisemitic element in the Great Invocation. According to Newman, &quot;the Plan&quot; named in the invocation refers to the plan authored by &quot;the Hierarchy&quot;, that Newman states places &quot;high priority on removing all Jewish presence and influence from human consciousness, a goal to be achieved by eliminating Judaism.&quot;

=== On organized religions ===
Bailey taught a form of universal spirituality that transcended denominational identification, believing that, &quot;Every class of human beings is a group of brothers. Catholics, Jews, Gentiles, occidentals and orientals are all the sons of God.&quot; She stated that all religions originate from the same spiritual source, and that humanity will eventually come to realize this, and as they do so, the result will be the emergence of a universal world religion and a &quot;new world order&quot;.

Author Steven Sutcliffe wrote that Bailey&#x27;s &quot;World Goodwill&quot; organization was promoting groups of &quot;world servers&quot; to, as he quotes Bailey, &quot;serve the Plan, Humanity, the Hierarchy and the Christ&quot;.

Despite her focus on unity of religion, Bromley and Hammond point out that Bailey and other &quot;occultists&quot; &quot;...hammered home the central idea, &#x27;The East is the true home of spiritual knowledge and occult wisdom&#x27;.&quot;

== Influence ==

=== Groups founded by Bailey or her followers ===
The Arcane School, founded by Alice and Foster Bailey to disseminate spiritual teachings, organizes a worldwide &quot;Triangles&quot; program to bring people together in groups of three, for daily meditation and study. Their belief is that they receive divine energy through meditation and that this energy is transmitted to humanity, so raising spiritual awareness. John Michael Greer&#x27;s &quot;New Encyclopedia of the Occult&quot; states that the school &quot;seeks to develop a New Group of World Servers to accomplish the work of the Hierarchy of Masters, under the guidance of its head, the Christ.&quot;

=== Influence on the New Age movement ===
Bailey made extensive use of the term &quot;New Age&quot; in her books and some writers have described her as the founder of the New Age movement, although &quot;The New Age&quot; was used as the title of a Journal of Christian liberalism and Socialism, published as early as 1894, predating Bailey&#x27;s use of the term.

James R. Lewis and J. Gordon Melton, in &quot;Perspectives on the New Age&quot; wrote, &quot;The most important—though certainly not the only—source of this transformative metaphor, as well as the term &quot;New Age&quot;, was Theosophy, particularly as the Theosophical perspective was mediated to the movement by the works of Alice Bailey.&quot;

Sir John Sinclair, in his book &quot;The Alice Bailey Inheritance&quot;, commented on the seminal influence of Alice Bailey, which, he said, underlies the consciousness growth movement in the 20th century.

=== Influence on neopaganism ===
Several writers have mentioned the affinity of some of Bailey&#x27;s concepts with modern expressions of paganism.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the neopagan author and ceremonial magic ritualist Caroll Poke Runyon published a magazine called &quot;The Seventh Ray,&quot; its name taken from the writings of Alice Bailey. Three volumes of collected articles from the magazine were published as &quot;The Seventh Ray Book I, The Blue Ray&quot;, &quot;The Seventh Ray Book II, the Red Ray&quot; and &quot;The Seventh Ray Book III, the Green Ray&quot;.

In contrast to this, Daren Kemp in &quot;Handbook to the New Age&quot; sees critical differences between neopaganism and New Age movements and indicates that it is a mistake to conflate them.

=== Influence on women in religion ===
Author Catherine Wessinger wrote that Bailey was a liberated woman &quot;...sixty years before it became popular&quot; and that Bailey&#x27;s books expressed a similar &quot;millennial view&quot; to the works of Annie Besant. Wessinger stated that they were &quot;an important source of the contemporary New Age movement.&quot;

According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Women And Religion in North America&quot;, several leaders of New Age philosophy have further developed Bailey&#x27;s teachings, including the well-known personalities JZ Knight (who purports to channel the entity known by the name Ramtha), Helen Schucman (author of &quot;A Course in Miracles&quot; purportedly through the process of telepathic dictation she called &quot;scribing&quot;), and Elizabeth Clare Prophet (who published what she referred to as &quot;dictations from Ascended Masters&quot;). These developments have been referred to by other sources as &quot;spin-offs&quot; and splinter groups.&quot; (p. 65) (p. 557) The differences between Theosophy, Bailey and Elizabeth Clare Prophet can be noted in connection with Elizabeth Clare Prophet&#x27;s radical concepts of catastrophic change and survivalism, including the building of fall-out shelters. (p. 81) The validity of the Elizabeth Clare Prophet&#x27;s writings was &quot;...disputed by Theosophical writers&quot;.

The many claims and teachings of the spin-off groups underscores their divergences, for example there appears to be a widespread confusion about the phrase and meaning of &quot;Ascendant Master&quot; in that it was adopted by Mark and Elizabeth Prophet but not by Theosophists or Alice Bailey. (p. 111) The concepts and language have been conflated in the popular mind.

=== Influence on psychotherapy and healing ===
In 1930, with the patronage of English-Dutch spiritualist, theosophist and scholar Olga Froebe-Kapteyn, Bailey established the short-lived &quot;School of Spiritual Research&quot; located on Froebe-Kapteyn&#x27;s estate, Casa Gabriella, in Switzerland. (In 1932 the school was closed because of personal conflict between Bailey and Froebe-Kapteyn, at which time Froebe-Kapteyn replaced it with the Eranos group.)

Roberto Assagioli, founder of Psychosynthesis, was a lecturer at School of Spiritual Research. He continued a close association with Bailey during the 1930s; some of his writings were published in Bailey&#x27;s magazine &quot;The Beacon&quot;; and he was a trustee of Bailey&#x27;s organization, the Lucis Trust. He had developed his approach to psychology, called Psychosynthesis, beginning in 1910; his methods were later influenced by some elements of Bailey&#x27;s work. However, authors John Firman and Ann Gila write that Assagioli kept what he referred to as a &quot;wall of silence&quot; between the areas of psychosynthesis and religion or metaphysics, insisting that they not be conflated with each other.

Roger J. Woolger said, in a paper presented to the &quot;Beyond the Brain&quot; Conference held at Cambridge University in 1999, &quot;In Tansley as in Brennan you will find descriptions of a hierarchy of subtle bodies called the etheric, emotional, mental and spiritual that surround the physical body. (Tansley attributed the source of his model to Alice Bailey&#x27;s theosophical commentary on The &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patanjali&quot;, the &quot;locus classicus&quot; of Hindu teaching.)&quot;

Bailey&#x27;s influence can be found in therapeutic communities with which she was never directly involved, such as the Human Potential Movement. She was also cited in &quot;THERAPEUTIC TOUCH: Healing Science or Psychic Midwife?&quot; by Sharon Fish.

=== Influence on UFO groups ===

Alice Bailey makes no reference to unidentified flying objects. This is not surprising since Alice Bailey&#x27;s books were written between 1919 and 1949 and &quot;the emergence of religion specifically focused on UFOs is a post-1947 phenomena.&quot; But she did speak of Masters as having evolved beyond the human level, and expounded a cosmology of a living universe in which even planets and stars are regarded as living entities. These ideas may partially account for an association in minds of some between Bailey, and others of the Theosophical schools, and UFOs. For instance, Christopher Partridge wrote of this association as &quot;easily transferred&quot;. The connection does exist in the sense that there is a subset of persons interested in both esoteric writings and UFOs and who link them as shown by the fact that some books that cite Alice Bailey or Theosophy also cite UFOs.

Christopher Partridge wrote that the works of Bailey, Rudolf Steiner, and Theosophy in general all influenced what he called the &quot;UFO religions&quot;. He explained that &quot;...Theosophy has several prominent branches, and, strictly speaking, the branch which has had the most important influence on the UFO religion is that developed by Alice Bailey&quot;. Partridge also quoted Gordon Melton, who suggested that the first UFO religion was Guy Ballard&#x27;s &quot;I Am&quot; Activity, (which Bailey described as a &quot;cheap comedy&quot;.)

Professor Robert S. Ellwood of the University of Southern California investigated a wide range of religious and spiritual groups in the United States during the 1970s, including a nationwide group of UFO believers called Understanding, Inc., which had been founded by a contactee named Daniel Fry. He reported that, &quot;There is no particular religious practice connected with the meeting, although the New Age Prayer derived from the Alice Bailey writings is used as an invocation.&quot;

New religious movement scholar George D. Chryssides cited Bailey&#x27;s influence on the ideas of the notorious Order of the Solar Temple cult and related New Age groups, writing that it is &quot;hard to overestimate Bailey’s influence on the Solar Temple&quot;. In particular, the preoccupation with the star Sirius and her emphasis on the theosophical concept of the Ascended Masters gave a momentum to the contemporary revival of Rosicrucianism; group leader Joseph Di Mambro would also utilize her Great Invocation to begin Solar Temple ceremonies. A related figure, French esotericist Jacques Breyer, would also draw heavily from Bailey&#x27;s ideas.

== In popular culture ==

Lou Reed of the Velvet Underground was a devoted reader of Bailey&#x27;s work, especially her book &quot;A Treatise on White Magic&quot;, which he urged on others. Author Ryan H. Walsh suggests that that book had an influence on the Velvet&#x27;s second album, &quot;White Light/White Heat.&quot;

In 1975, Todd Rundgren released an album titled &quot;Initiation&quot; which has a song called &quot;Initiation&quot; on side one. The title of the album is apparently based on the Theosophical concept of initiation taught by Alice A. Bailey and C.W. Leadbeater. The entire second side of the album is taken up by a song called &quot;A Treatise on Cosmic Fire&quot;; the three parts of the song are listed as: &quot;I. The Internal Fire, or Fire by Friction; II. The Fire of Spirit, or Electric Fire; The Fire of Mind, or Solar Fire.&quot; The second parts of these three phrases are taken directly from Alice A. Bailey&#x27;s book &quot;A Treatise on Cosmic Fire&quot;. Also in 1975, Rundgren released an album by his side-project Utopia titled &quot;Another Live&quot;. This album contained a song titled &quot;The Seven Rays&quot; (see reference above). Finally, in 1977, Rundgren followed up with another Bailey reference with a song entitled &quot;Love in Action&quot; from the Utopia album &quot;Oops! Wrong Planet&quot;. &quot;Love in Action&quot; was the concept promoted by Bailey&#x27;s and Foster Bailey&#x27;s &quot;World Goodwill&quot; organization.

In 1982, Bailey&#x27;s influence appeared in pop culture, with the release of Van Morrison&#x27;s album &quot;Beautiful Vision&quot;, in which he directly referred to the teachings and the Tibetan in the lyrics of the songs &quot;Dweller on the Threshold&quot; and &quot;Aryan Mist&quot;. Morrison also used the phrase &quot;world of glamour&quot;, reminiscent of Bailey&#x27;s &quot;Glamour: A World Problem&quot;, in the songs &quot;Ivory Tower&quot; and &quot;Green Mansions&quot;. The song &quot;Ancient of Days&quot; from the 1984 &quot;Sense of Wonder&quot; album appears to be a reference to a Bailey concept found in such books as &quot;The Externalization of the Hierarchy&quot;. Alice A. Bailey and the Tibetan&#x27;s &quot;Glamour: A World Problem&quot; is also directly cited in the liner notes to Morrison&#x27;s album &quot;Inarticulate Speech of the Heart&quot;.

<text>The London Charterhouse is a historic complex of buildings in Clerkenwell, London, dating to the 14th century. It occupies land to the north of Charterhouse Square, and lies within the London Borough of Islington. It was originally built (and takes its name from) a Carthusian priory, founded in 1371 on the site of a Black Death burial ground. Following the priory&#x27;s dissolution in 1537, it was rebuilt from 1545 onwards to become one of the great courtyard houses of Tudor London. In 1611, the property was bought by Thomas Sutton, a businessman and &quot;the wealthiest commoner in England&quot;, who established a school for the young and an almshouse for the old. The almshouse remains in occupation today, while the school was re-located in 1872 to Godalming, Surrey.

Although substantial fragments survive from the monastic period, most of the standing buildings date from the Tudor era. Thus, today the complex &quot;conveys a vivid impression of the type of large rambling 16th-century mansion that once existed all round London&quot;.

==History==
===Priory===
In 1348, Walter Manny rented of land in Spital Croft, north of Long Lane, from the Master and Brethren of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital for a graveyard and plague pit for victims of the Black Death. A chapel and hermitage were constructed, renamed New Church Haw; but in 1371 this land was granted for the foundation of a Carthusian monastery under the name of &quot;The House of the Salutation of the Mother of God&quot; In English, a Carthusian monastery is called a &quot;Charterhouse&quot; (derived from the Grande Chartreuse, the original monastery of the order), and thus the Carthusian monastery in London was referred to as the &quot;London Charterhouse.&quot; As per Carthusian custom, the twenty-five monks each had their own small building and garden. Thomas More came to the monastery for spiritual recuperation.

The monastery was closed in 1537, in the Dissolution of the Monasteries during the English Reformation. As they resisted Henry VIII&#x27;s claim to be Head of the Church, the members of the community were treated harshly: the Prior, John Houghton was hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn and ten monks were taken to the nearby Newgate Prison; nine of these men were starved to death and the tenth was executed three years later at Tower Hill. They constitute the group known as the Carthusian Martyrs of London.

===Tudor mansion===

For several years after the dissolution of the priory, members of the Bassano family of instrument makers were amongst the tenants of the former monks&#x27; cells, whilst Henry VIII stored hunting equipment in the church. In 1545, the entire site was bought by Sir Edward (later Lord) North (c. 1496–1564), who transformed the complex into a luxurious mansion house. North demolished the church and built the Great Hall and adjoining Great Chamber. In 1558, during North&#x27;s occupancy, Elizabeth I used the house during the preparations for her coronation.

Following North&#x27;s death, the property was purchased by Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, who renamed it Howard House. In 1570, following his imprisonment in the Tower of London for scheming to marry Mary, Queen of Scots, Norfolk was placed under house arrest at the Charterhouse. He occupied his time by embellishing the house, and built a long terrace in the garden (which survives as the &quot;Norfolk Cloister&quot;) leading to a tennis court. In 1571, Norfolk&#x27;s involvement in the Ridolfi plot was exposed after a ciphered letter from Mary was discovered under a doormat in the house; he was executed the following year.

The property passed to Norfolk&#x27;s son, Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk. During his occupancy, James I held court there for three days on his first entrance into London in 1603.

===Almshouse and school===

In May 1611 it came into the hands of Thomas Sutton (1532–1611) of Knaith, Lincolnshire. He was appointed Master of Ordnance in Northern Parts, and acquired a fortune by the discovery of coal on two estates which he had leased near Newcastle upon Tyne, and later, upon moving to London, he carried on a commercial career. Before he died on 12 December of that year, he endowed a hospital on the site of the Charterhouse, calling it the Hospital of King James; and in his will he bequeathed money to maintain a chapel, hospital (almshouse) and school.
In the &quot;Case of Sutton&#x27;s Hospital&quot;, his will was hotly contested but upheld in court, meaning the foundation was constituted to afford a home for eighty male pensioners (&quot;gentlemen by descent and in poverty, soldiers that have borne arms by sea or land, merchants decayed by piracy or shipwreck, or servants in household to the King or Queens Majesty&quot;), and to educate forty boys.

Charterhouse early established a reputation for excellence in hospital care and treatment, thanks in part to Henry Levett, M.D., an Oxford graduate who joined the school as physician in 1712. Levett was widely esteemed for his medical writings, including an early tract on the treatment of smallpox. He was buried in Charterhouse Chapel, and his widow married Andrew Tooke, the master of Charterhouse.

The school, Charterhouse School, developed beyond the original intentions of its founder, to become a well-regarded public school. In 1872, under the headmastership of William Haig Brown, the school moved to new buildings in the parish of Godalming in Surrey, opening on 18 June.

===Twentieth century===

Following the departure of Charterhouse School, its buildings, on the site of the former monastic great cloister, were taken over by Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, until that moved out in turn in 1933 to a new site near Northwood, Hertfordshire. The school buildings then became home to the St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital Medical School, and (though now much redeveloped) remain one of the sites occupied by its successor, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry. The main part of the cloister garth continues to be a well-tended site mostly laid to lawn in the quadrangle of the university site.

The principal historic buildings of the Charterhouse were severely damaged by enemy action on the night of 10–11 May 1941, during the Blitz. The great hall and great chamber were severely damaged, the great staircase totally destroyed and the four sides of the Master&#x27;s Court burnt out. These were restored between 1950 and 1959 by the architectural firm of Seely &amp; Paget, a rebuilding which allowed the exposure and embellishment of some medieval and much 16th- and 17th-century fabric that had previously been concealed or obscured.

In preparation for and in conjunction with the restoration project, archaeological investigations were carried out by W. F. Grimes, which led to a greatly enhanced understanding of the layout of the monastic buildings, and the discovery of the remains of Walter de Manny, the founder, buried in a lead coffin before the high altar of the monastic chapel. These remains were identified as Manny&#x27;s beyond reasonable doubt by the presence in the coffin of a lead &quot;bulla&quot; (seal) of Pope Clement VI: in 1351 Clement had granted Manny a licence to select his own deathbed confessor, a document that would have been issued with just such a &quot;bulla&quot; attached.

Charterhouse continues to serve as an almshouse to over 40 older people, known as Brothers, who are in need of financial and companionship support. Since 2017 women have been accepted as Brothers, and the site has been open for pre-booked guided tours; and it is free to view the chapel and museum with chapel services open to the public.

===Revealing the Charterhouse===
In partnership with the Museum of London the Charterhouse opened the site to the public in 2017. There are three key elements: a museum, which tells the story of the Charterhouse from the Black Death to the present day; a Learning Room and Learning Programme so that school groups can discover how the Charterhouse has been home to everyone from monks and monarchs to schoolboys and Brothers; and a landscaped Charterhouse Square, open to the public so that people can enjoy the green surroundings. Works for this project were completed and opened to the public in January 2017.
==Local government==
Charterhouse was an extra-parochial area, an area lying outside any of the ancient parish units from which London&#x27;s modern administrative units evolved through a succession of mergers. It was not included in one of the &quot;districts&quot; – groupings of civil parishes, brought together for local government purposes – under the Metropolis Management Act 1855. In 1858, following the Extra-Parochial Places Act 1857 (20 Vict. c. 19), it effectively became a civil parish for all purposes, with the provision that it would not form part of any poor law union, but later became a component of the &quot;Holborn Poor Law Union&quot; from 1877 until 1900.

In 1900 it became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury, and was abolished as a separate civil parish in 1915. Since 1965 it has been part of the London Borough of Islington in Greater London.

<text>Scordatura (; literally, Italian for &quot;discord&quot;, or &quot;mistuning&quot;) is a tuning of a string instrument that is different from the normal, standard tuning. It typically attempts to allow special effects or unusual chords or timbre, or to make certain passages easier to play. It is common to notate the finger position as if played in regular tuning, while the actual pitch resulting is altered (scordatura notation). When all the strings are tuned by the same interval up or down, as in the case of the viola in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra&quot;, the part is transposed as a whole.

==Bowed string instruments==

The invention of scordatura tuning has been attributed to Thomas Baltzar, a prodigious German violinist and composer who is known to have used the technique in around the 1660s, at least a decade before Biber composed his &quot;Rosary Sonatas&quot; in which he employed the tuning technique. Of course, German violinist Hans Hake (1628 – after 1667) includes three works in &quot;Vorstimmung&quot; (&quot;upset tuning&quot;) for two violins (#25, #29, &amp; #33) in his collection &quot;Ander Theil Newer Pavanen,…&quot; (Stade: Elias Holwein, 1654) making this attribution false.

Scordatura was much used by composers for viola d&#x27;amore, violin and cello, including J. S. Bach, Biber, Vivaldi, Ariosti, Vilsmayr, and others in compositions for violin during the early 18th century. A special type of notation was used to make it easier to read. This notation was also used to notate music for the viola d&#x27;amore, an instrument played and composed for by composers such as Biber and Vivaldi. The viola d&#x27;amore used a great number of different tunings and writing music for it in scordatura notation was a natural choice for composers of the time.

==Notable usage of &quot;scordatura&quot; in Western art music==
===Violin===

* Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber&#x27;s &quot;Rosary Sonatas&quot; for violin and continuo (c. 1674). Aside from the first (&quot;Annunciation&quot;) and last works (&quot;Passacaglia&quot;, for solo violin) of this collection, wherein the instrument is set to the common G-D-A-E tuning, the violin for each sonata is tuned to a different array of pitches. Sonata XI (&quot;Resurrection&quot;) is a special case: in addition to a unique scordatura, the two inner strings of the violin are interchanged between the bridge and tailpiece of the instrument, thus creating a tuning (from top string to bottom string) of G-g-D-d. &quot;Harmonia Artificiosa no. VII&quot; in C minor is written in a form of scordatura on a nine line stave. See viola d&#x27;amore for more information.
* Johann Joseph Vilsmayr &quot;Artificiosus Consentus Pro Camera&quot;, a set of six partitas published in 1715. The middle four partitas use scordatura tunings.
* Johann Pachelbel&#x27;s &quot;Musikalische Ergötzung&quot; &quot;bestehend in 6 verstimmten Partien&quot; (Musical Entertainment consisting of six suites for mistuned violins, 1691), six suites for two violins and continuo. Tunings include C-F-C-F, C-G-C-F, B-E-B-E, B-E-B-E, C-G-C-F, and B-F-B-E.
* Antonio Vivaldi, violin concerto in A major, Op.9, No.6, in which the violin&#x27;s G string is tuned up to an A, allowing for a beautifully resonant scale and arpeggio motif ending on the retuned string.
* Georg Philipp Telemann, Concerto in A Major for two Violins, TWV 43:7.
* In Joseph Haydn&#x27;s Symphony No. 60 in C (&quot;Il Distratto&quot;), the first and second violins start the finale of this unusual six-movement symphony with the lowest string tuned to F, but tune up to G in the course of the music to create a comical effect. The title of the symphony means &quot;the absent-minded man&quot; – so it is as if the violins have &quot;forgotten&quot; to tune their strings. The music fully pauses for the violins to re-tune before continuing. Haydn also uses a violin with the lowest string tuned to F in the trio of his Symphony No. 67 in F.
* Niccolò Paganini&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 1 initially required the strings of the solo violin to be tuned a semitone higher to match the original key of E major.
* Camille Saint-Saëns, solo violin in &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;, where the E-string is tuned to E. This changes the open intervals of the double stop A and E to the tritone (A and E), which is used as the opening motif of the work.
* Gustav Mahler, scordatura violin soloist in the 2nd movement of his 4th Symphony. In this case, the composer probably desired the specific tone of the sound produced by a scordatura violin, which is less &quot;suave&quot; than the sound of a standard tuning.
* Franz von Vecsey&#x27;s &quot;Nuit du Nord&quot;, a 1921 work for violin and piano, requires the G string to be tuned down to F.
*In Max Scherek&#x27;s Sérénade et boléro for solo violin, Op. 27, the violin must be tuned to F, F, D, B.
* Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Firebird&quot; makes a rare, perhaps unique, demand for the entire first violin section to retune the E string, in order to play the D major harmonic glissandi of the introduction. 
* In Béla Bartók&#x27;s piece &quot;Contrasts&quot; for clarinet, violin and piano, the opening bars of the third movement utilize a different tuning on a separate violin (G-D-A-E) for a Hungarian folk effect.
* Richard Strauss&#x27;s tone poem &quot;Ein Heldenleben&quot; as well as his opera &quot;Elektra&quot; include passages in which the violins must tune their G strings down in order to play a G or F. 
* György Ligeti&#x27;s Violin Concerto.
* John Corigliano&#x27;s &quot;Stomp&quot; for solo violin (2010) requires the outer two strings to be tuned lower, resulting in a E-D-A-D tuning.
* Eugène Ysaÿe&#x27;s &quot;Poème élégiaque&quot; requires the lowest string to be tuned down to F.

===Viola d&#x27;amore===
* In the original version of Vivaldi’s opera &quot;Tito Manlio&quot; (Mantua, 1719), Servilia’s aria ‘Tu dormi in tante pene’ also contains an obbligato part for viola d&#x27;amore written in scordatura notation. This part would undoubtedly have been played by Vivaldi himself. He was the only known player of the instrument at the court of the Duke of Hesse-Darmstadt in Mantua, his employer at that time and for whom this opera was written. The obbligato part is on smaller paper inserted into the first violin part. Vivaldi would have led the orchestra from the concertmaster&#x27;s chair and would have played the first violin part, presumably switching to viola d&#x27;amore for this aria. The aria &quot;Quanto Magis Generosa&quot; in Vivaldi&#x27;s Oratorio &quot;Juditha triumphans&quot; (1716) also contains an obbligato part for viola d&#x27;amore written in scordatura notation. This piece was written for the Ospedale della Pieta and the obbligato part would have been played either by Vivaldi or by Anna Maria del violino, one of the senior musicians there at the time who was a known player of the viola d&#x27;amore. Curiously, all Vivaldi&#x27;s other works for viola d&#x27;amore, (eight concertos and two obbligato numbers in different settings of the &quot;Nisi Dominus&quot;), are written in normal notation at sounding pitch.

===Viola===
* Mozart wrote the solo viola part for his &quot;Sinfonia Concertante&quot; a semitone lower, with the viola strings to be tuned a semitone &quot;higher&quot; to D, A, E, B. Thus part is written in D major (the key of the work is E major). A common practice of the time, changing the pitch of the open strings was primarily intended to make the viola sound &quot;louder&quot;, and so better discernible in the symphonic orchestra: indeed, increasing the tension in a string, not only sharpens the pitch, but also makes it sound louder, the loudest sound being obtained just before breaking. Other viola concerti employing this type of scordatura were written by Carl Stamitz, Johann Baptist Wanhal, Johann Andreas Amon, Jiří Družecký, Johannes Matthias Sperger and Johann Georg Hermann Voigt. The fragment of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonia Concertante&quot; for violin, viola, and cello similarly is written in A major, but the viola part is written in G major with the strings to be tuned a whole tone higher.
* In Carl Nielsen&#x27;s Hymnus amoris, Op.12, the violas are asked to retune the C string to the lower A from bar 494 to the end (bar 606).
* In Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, the solo viola tunes the C string down to B.1
* Géza Frid&#x27;s 1946 Sonatina for viola and piano, Op. 25, requires the violist to tune the lower two strings up a semitone for movement IV, resulting in C, G, D, A.

===Cello===
* Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Fifth Cello Suite is written with the A string, the highest string, tuned down a whole step to a G. This tuning allows chords which would be difficult or impossible at regular tuning. The Suite is also played with standard tuning, but some pitches must be altered, and occasional notes removed to accommodate the tuning.
* Robert Schumann&#x27;s Piano Quartet in E-flat, Op. 47, requires the cellist to retune the C string down to B for the last 42 bars of the third movement.
* Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s The Rite of Spring, the final chord of &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; requires the cellos to retune A to G so it may be played &quot;open&quot; (unstopped by the fingers and consequently more resonant) as part of a quadruple stop.
* Ottorino Respighi&#x27;s tone poem &quot;Pines of Rome&quot; requires the cellos to tune the low C string down to a B in the third movement. Also, the basses must either have a fifth low B string or tune a C extension down to the B in the third and fourth movements.
* Zoltán Kodály&#x27;s Solo Cello Sonata in B minor requires the cellist to tune down the two lower strings from G and C to F and B, to emphasize the key with recurring B-minor chords.
* Luciano Berio&#x27;s Sequenza XIV requires the G string to be tuned up to a G, to better depict the kandyan drumming passages, as well as creating extreme dissonances over all four strings.
* The cello in George Crumb&#x27;s chamber work &quot;Vox Balaenae&quot; (scored for electric flute, electric cello, and electric piano). The traditional C-G-D-A tuning is changed to B-F-D-A, which serves to emphasize the key of B major that emerges in the final movement. 
* The cello in Paul Hindemith’s 2nd string quartet tunes their C string down to B♭ during part of the 3rd movement.
* The cello soloist&#x27;s final note of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Variations&quot; requires the player to play and retune in one movement, creating a dramatic glissando effect to the A below the cello&#x27;s normal lowest note of C.

===Double bass===

The double bass is sometimes required to play notes lower than the E to which its lowest string is normally tuned. This can be accomplished with a special mechanical extension with which some double basses are equipped or the composer may ask the double bass to tune down its E string, as in, for example, the third movement of Brahms&#x27;s Requiem, in which Brahms has some of the double basses tune the E-string down to D in order to sustain the low D pedal point or in the 9th Movement of &quot;Ma mère l&#x27;oye&quot; (Cinquième tableau – Laideronnette, impératrice des Pagodes), in which Ravel has the double basses lower their E-strings a semitone. (George Crumb&#x27;s &quot;A Haunted Landscape&quot; requires that two bassists use C extensions and still tune down past them to B.) Other kinds of scordatura occur most commonly in solo double bass literature, especially including one that raises all four strings a whole step to F&#x27;-B&#x27;-E-A.

==Guitar==

Alternate tunings other than symmetrically stepped-down versions of standard or drop-D tuning (where the lowest string is tuned down two half-steps for simple barred power or fifth chords) are rare in modern classical guitar music, but before the nineteenth century they occurred more often. Drop-D tuning remains common. The sixteenth-century guitar typically had four courses (rather than six strings, as the modern classical does), and the seventeenth-century and eighteenth-century guitar typically had five courses. These were subject to a variety of tunings, such that there is some difficulty establishing which, if any, to consider the standard tuning from which the others deviate. It is sometimes suggested that classical guitarists wishing to read Renaissance lute or vihuela tablature tune their guitar E-A-d-f-b-e&#x27; since these instruments in this period usually have the major third between the 3rd and 4th strings.

With the exception of bands using seven-, eight- or recently nine-string guitars to extend the instrument&#x27;s range downwards, rhythm guitar for modern metal almost universally uses stepped-down versions of standard or drop D tuning, with professionals and amateurs alike commonly using terminology like “tuning to C” (same pattern as standard tuning, but all strings lowered by four half-steps) or “Drop C tuning” (drop-D tuning lowered two half-steps). Conversely, other tuning patterns are rare, with the few popular acts using them commonly widely recognized for the fact (prominent examples being the bands Sonic Youth and Soundgarden).
In certain kinds of folk music alternate tunings for guitar can be fairly frequently found, most typically open tunings where the open strings are tuned to a full major, minor, suspended or extended chord.

== Piano ==
Relative to other stringed instruments, piano scordatura tuning is very rare, considering the relative difficulty of tuning and re-tuning a piano from equal temperament. However, some 20th and 21st century music calls for certain notes on the piano to be tuned differently, or the entire piano to be tuned altogether.

* John Corigliano&#x27;s &quot;Three Hallucinations&quot; from the film &quot;Altered States&quot; requires a piano tuner to tune 9 pitches to be a quarter tone flat, and 10 pitches to be &quot;out of tune&quot;.
* Ivan Wyschnegradsky wrote several pieces for quarter-tone piano, many of which are recorded on two separate pianos tuned a quarter tone apart.

<text>Middle English Bible translations covers the age of Middle English (c. 1100–1500), beginning after the Norman Conquest (1066) and ending about 1500.

The most well-known and preserved translations are those of the Wycliffean bibles.

Between two and four Middle English translations of each book of the New Testament still exist, mainly from the late 1300s, and at least two vernacular Psalters, plus various poetic renditions of bible stories, and numerous translations of sections and verses in published sermons and commentaries. The cost and translation effort of complete bibles (pandects) favoured the production of selections and compilations of significant passages. 

==Sources of Scripture==

Historian Richard Marsden notes a &quot;mediated&quot; bible: &quot;Although it is true that there was almost no direct translation of the Bible into the vernacular before the Wycliffites, we simply cannot ignore the astonishingly large and varied corpus of Bible-based vernacular works which had begun to appear from the very early years of the 13th century onwards, under ecclesiastical influence (largely in response to the demands of the Lateran Council of 1215 for a more proactive approach to educating the laity in spiritual discipline). They included universal Bible histories[...], metrical paraphrases of Old Testament biblical books, devotional texts, versions of the Psalms, Gospel narratives (canonical and apochryphal), and so on.&quot;

Historian James Morey, looking at &quot;all Middle English poetry and prose that consisted largely of biblical material&quot; wrote that &quot;when taken as a whole nearly all of the Old and New Testaments exist in Middle English before the Wycliffites began their project in the 1380s,&quot; though &quot;these contents are idiosyncratic and eclectic.&quot; For Morey, &quot;the Wycliffites are ‘first’ in their coordinated efforts to produce a
complete scholarly English Bible&quot; and their project was characterized by &quot;care, prestige, and organization&quot; rather than operating in a vernacular vacuum.

According to some historians, the culture was saturated with key biblical knowledge. For example, Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; contains over 700 biblical allusions.

==Times==
===Linguistic diversity and flux===
Language in Britain in the early second millennium was in considerable flux and diversity: the population of England used numerous dialects of four main languages: Old then Middle English, Old Norse then Anglo-Norman French, Medieval Latin, and Cornish. Cumbric may still have been spoken in some places in the North. The Anglo-Saxon royal courts were replaced by the Anglo-Danish, then the Anglo-Norman. In the early 1000s, following King Canute&#x27;s ban, any residual use of English runes ceased, in favour of Latin script augmented with several runic characters, and some Old Norse features of the Northern dialects seeped Southwards. There was a lingering strong Anglo-Scandinavian influence on literature and culture.

The Norman Conquest caused a suppression of Anglo-Saxon (the last poem in Old English dates to 1104) and Anglo-Norman language contact influenced the development of Middle English.

A psaltery glossed with Anglo-Norman exists from about 1160. &quot;About the middle of the fourteenth century — before 1361 — the Anglo-Normans possessed an independent and probably complete translation of the whole of the Old Testament and the greater part of the New.&quot; There are several references to a 14th century Cornish translation which, if it existed, was soon lost.

===Factors against===
Early Middle English biblical literature was limited because
* the synthetic Anglo-Saxon Old English dialect continuum had broken down and was transitioning inconsistently to the analytic Middle English dialect continuum with a duplicate Frenchified vocabulary, 
* from 1066 to c. 1400 Anglo-Norman French was the official language of courts and government in quadrilingual England (which, from the 1300s evolved into Law French, only spoken in law courts and eventually only written), and the preferred language of the elite who could fund vernacular book production,
* Latin was the preferred classical, academic and church language throughout medieval Western Europe,
* poetic forms suited for oral transmission were more relevant to the partly-literate general population than prose, and
* Cost. Even in the new, small Paris Bible format, over 50 animal skins were needed for the New Testament alone. Some historians see a rise of a literate middle class following the Black Death: this increased wealth and independence may have promoted demand for personal Bibles after the 1350s.

===Format===
* In and before the 1000s, most Bible codexes were the enormous corporate Great Bibles in Latin suited for display and public reading even at night. 
* The 1100s saw the development of personal breviaries in Latin containing only readings in the liturgy. 
* The 1200s saw an explosion of Bible production, in the Latin, in Europe as copying moved from being a monastic enterprise to also a commercial one. A pandect Bible format intended for personal use (liturgical, preaching, pastoral, university), the Paris Bible, was developed by the relatively new preaching orders and frequently copied as small, portable &quot;pocket Bibles.&quot;
* However, the 1300s was the only fertile time for Middle English Bible translation, as now-stable Middle English became usable in court pleadings, and gained vocabulary and respectability under the influence of writers such as Chaucer. 
* In the 1400s in England, publication of new unauthorized translations were banned, following the Lollard violence, and Middle English then transitioned to Early Modern English.

==Partial translations==
===Early===
The focus of vernacular biblical material was the vivid or presentation of edifying or notable contents, rather than the provision of an exhaustive facsimile of the originals. This favoured treatment of narrative episodes and psalmody over abstract theology, and the use of poetic forms that aided memorization and oral recital. For a largely illiterate or semi-literate laity, vernacular scripture was always mediated orally, visually or melodically.

The 19,000 line Ormulum, produced by the Augustinian friar Orm of Lincolnshire around 1150, includes partial translations and paraphrases of parts of the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles from Latin into the dialect of the East Midlands, perhaps intended as declaimed sermons. The manuscript is written in the iambic septenary meter.

Sample of Early Middle English from the Ormulum (Luke 1:5):


A notable example of the transmission of biblical stories in a vernacular in flux is the c. 1850-line &quot;La Estorie del Euangelie&quot;, a Middle English poem that paraphrases the Nativity and Passion texts; it was reformulated in least seven quite different versions between the early 1200s to the early 1400s, each in different English dialects (East, West, South Midlands version, Northern, Southern and Southwest) and vocabularies (with Scandinavian words being replaced by French words over time). Some of the versions show signs of oral transmission with re-composition, and one of the versions may have been transcribed by a non-speaker of Middle English. Material from it found its way into the &quot;Northern Passion&quot; from the English South-West.

Paraphrases of many biblical passages are included in the 30,000 line &quot;Cursor Mundi&quot;, a world chronicle written about 1300.

The &quot;Stanzaic Life of Christ&quot; is a 10,840 line poem derived in large part from two Latin works &quot;Polychronicon&quot; (c. 1350) and the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; (c. 1260) and then quoted loosely in at least seven of the Middle English plays of the Chester Mystery Plays in the late 1300s.

===Mid===
* Richard Rolle of Hampole (or de Hampole) was an Oxford-educated hermit and writer of religious texts. In the early 14th century, he produced English glosses of Latin Bible text, including the Psalms. Rolle translated the Psalms into a Northern English dialect, but later copies were written in Southern English dialects.
* Around the same time, an anonymous author in the West Midlands region produced another gloss of the complete Psalms: the &quot;West Midland Prose Psalter&quot;.
* In the early years of the 14th century, a French copy of the Book of Revelation was anonymously translated into English.
* Prose works such as the &quot;Book to a Mother&quot; exist which are largely composed of biblical material.

Historian Mary Dove noted &quot;Neither arguing in favour of an English Bible, nor assembling a collection of writings in favour of an English Bible, were intrinsically Wycliffite activities.&quot;

* Anna Paues (1904) edited a 14th century translation of most of the New Testament: the Epistles, Acts and part of the Gospel of Matthew which does not seem to be derived from the Wycliffite versions.
* The Paues book also discusses other manuscripts, such as MS. Pepys 2498 (Magdalene College, Cambridge) which has a Life of Jesus (or Gospel harmony) formed from Middle English translations of the 112 readings from the church evangeliary, perhaps itself though a French translation.
* Margaret Joyce Powell (1916) edited the non-Wycliffean Middle English commentary and translation of the Gospels of Mark and Luke, and the Pauline epistles, dating them to the late 1300s.
* Another non-Wycliffean commentary and translation of Matthew&#x27;s Gospel exists in two manuscripts.

Biblical manuscripts were often selections or anthologies with other material.

===Psalms===
There are five complete renditions of the Psalms into Middle English still existing (the &quot;Metrical&quot;, Rolle&#x27;s, the &quot;Prose&quot;, and the Wycliffite EV and LV) and numerous translations of individual Psalms.

==== Primer Psalms ====
Primers were English vernacular prayer books (or Book of Hours) to assist preparation for the Use of Sarum Latin Mass. About half of these (c. 1400 to 1520) have Psalms derive from the Wycliffean Late Version (LV), but the other half have Psalms with translations from some other source(s), now lost, but perhaps owing something to the Wycliffean Early Version(s) (EV.)

Here is Psalm 6:1,2 from a 15th Century primer, in parts similar to one of the EV versions:

&lt;poem&gt;
Lord, in þi wodenes (anger, rage) repreve (censure) not me
 ne in þi wraþ sle (strike) not me
Lord have mercy on me for y am syk
 hele me lord for my bones be togederstrublid (together disquieted)
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Complete translations==
In the late 14th century, the first (known, extant) complete Middle English language Bible was produced, probably by scholars at Oxford University. This New Testament was initially completed by 1380 and the Old Testament a few years later and is a word-for-word translation of the Vulgate suited for scholarly reference. Some 30 copies of this Early Version (EV) Bible survive, with some variation.

The authorship is controversial among scholars.

* Traditionally, there was held to be some connection to John Wycliffe as inspiration or instigator or glossator or translator — hence it often called Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible or &quot;Wycliffite&quot; Bibles. It is thought that a large portion of the Old Testament was translated by Nicholas Hereford.
* The EV was revised into more idiomatic Middle English suited for devotional use in the last years of the 14th century, perhaps by John Purvey. This Later Version (LV) was subject to the same conditions and has more manuscript copies than the earlier. Some 130 copies exist, including some now belonging to the British royal family.
**In the 1500s, the Wycliffean LV text was transcribed into Scots (a language with features of Northern Middle English and now Modern English) but the version was lost until recently. 
* Modern scholars such as Henry Ansgar Kelly and Anne Hudson —following a view held by several earlier Catholic commentators including Thomas More and Francis Aidan Gasquet— argue that there is no evidence that these Middle English Bibles were heterodox products of Wycliffe and followers of his theology, but that they were orthodox Catholic translations that were &quot;Wycliffied&quot; over the years by partisan academics who uncritically accepted as legitimate and definitive the problematic so-called &quot;General Prologue&quot; that is found in only 8% of extant manuscripts.

From the time of King Richard II until the time of the English Reformation, individuals who owned Bibles with Lollard material could be investigated as potential Lollard heretical seditionists, and those who read or lectured publicly from that material publicly could be prosecuted for promoting heretical sedition. Books containing Lollard material, such as the so-called General Prologue found some manuscripts were eventually banned. All dated copies are dated before the restrictions.

==Later partial translations==

William Caxton translated many Bible stories and passages from the French, producing the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; (1483) and &quot;The Book of the Knight in the Tower&quot; (1484). He also printed &quot;The Mirror of the Blessed Life of Jesus Christ&quot; by Pseudo-Bonaventure, translated by Nicholas Love, OCart.

==Legacy==

All translations of this time period were from Latin or French. The influence of oral and non-Wycliffean Middle English Bible translations and vocabulary on Early Modern English translations (i.e., related to William Tyndale) has not been studied.

Humanism of the Renaissance made popular again the study of the classics and the classical languages and thus allowed critical Greek scholarship to again become a possibility. Greek and Hebrew texts would become more widely available with Johannes Gutenberg&#x27;s development of the movable-type printing press, with his first major work an edition of the Latin Vulgate, now called the Gutenberg Bible, in 1455. In the early 16th century, Erasmus published a single volume of the Latin and Greek texts of the New Testament books and continued publishing more precise editions of this volume until his death. The availability of these texts, along with renewed interest in the biblical languages themselves, enabled more scholars in their debates and exegesis to include philological considerations.

The other great event of that same century was the development of Early Modern English, making English a literary language, leading to a great increase in the number of translations of the Bible in that era.

<text>The Findhorn Foundation is a Scottish charitable trust registered in 1972, formed by the spiritual community at the Findhorn Ecovillage, one of the largest intentional communities in Britain. It has been home to thousands of residents from more than 40 countries. The Foundation closed all its educational programmes in September 2023 whereas the Findhorn community eco village at Findhorn houses about 40 community businesses such as the Findhorn Press and an alternative medicine centre.

Before the Findhorn Foundation in 1972, there was a Findhorn Trust as more people joined Eileen Caddy, Peter Caddy and Dorothy Maclean, who had arrived at the Caravan Park at Findhorn Bay on 17 November 1962. The Findhorn Foundation and surrounding Findhorn Ecovillage community at The Park, Findhorn, a village in Moray, Scotland, and at Cluny Hill in Forres, is now home to more than 400 people.

The Findhorn Foundation and the surrounding community have no formal doctrine or creed. The Foundation were offering a range of workshops, programmes and events in the environment of a working ecovillage and at Cluny Hill Hotel in nearby Forres. 

Findhorn Ecovillage has been awarded UN Habitat Best Practice designation from the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (HABITAT), and regularly holds seminars of CIFAL Findhorn, a United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), affiliated training centre for Northern Europe.

==Early history==
In the late 1940s Sheena Govan emerged as an informal spiritual teacher to a small circle that included her then-husband, Peter Caddy, and Dorothy Maclean. Eileen Caddy, as she became, who had a background in the Moral Rearmament (MRA) movement, joined them in the early 1950s. The group&#x27;s principal focus was dedication to the &#x27;Christ Within&#x27; and following God&#x27;s guidance. In 1957 Peter and Eileen Caddy were appointed to manage the Cluny Hill Hotel near Forres, Maclean joining them as the hotel&#x27;s secretary. Though now separated from Sheena Govan, whose relationship with Eileen Caddy had deteriorated, they continued with the practices she taught. In the early 1960s, Caddy, along with others who called themselves &quot;channellers&quot;, believed that they were in contact with extraterrestrials through telepathy, and prepared a landing strip for flying saucers at nearby Cluny Hill.

In late 1962, Caddy&#x27;s employment with the hotel chain that owned Cluny Hill, at the time he was working in the Trossachs, was terminated. He and Eileen settled in a caravan near the village of Findhorn; an annex was built in early 1963, so that Maclean could live close to the Caddy family. Eileen Caddy&#x27;s direct relationship with God began with an experience in Glastonbury, where she recorded that she heard a voice say &quot;Be Still and Know that I am God&quot;. Peter Caddy followed &quot;an intuitive spontaneous inner knowing&quot; and was influenced by theosophy and MRA, from which he developed methods of positive thinking and other methods he had learned in the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship.

Maclean initially followed practices from the Sufi group centred on the teachings of Inayat Khan, and from this developed her contact with the divine to focus upon communication with &#x27;nature spirits&#x27; which she named as &quot;devas&quot;. The three of them agreed that Maclean&#x27;s contacts should be made useful for the growing of food which was supplementing their income (the family at this point being entirely supported by Family Allowance). The Caddys credited the garden&#x27;s success of producing &quot;exceptionally large vegetables&quot; – on these practices. More conventional explanations have been suggested by locals from outside the community who feel that the garden&#x27;s successes can be explained by the unique microclimate of Moray or the substantial quantities of horse manure donated by a local farmer.

Many others were involved with varying importance and influences in the early years, from Lena Lamont, part of Sheena Govan&#x27;s circle, who lived in her caravan with her family and who shunned publicity, to those whom Peter Caddy met as he travelled in British New Age circles: among them Robert Ogilvie Crombie (ROC), who wrote of nature spirits in &quot;The Findhorn Garden&quot;; Sir George Trevelyan who formed the Wrekin Trust; Anthony Walter Dayrell Brooke, Liebie Pugh, and Joan Hartnell-Beavis. Through connections such as these and the distribution of Eileen Caddy&#x27;s writings in the form of a booklet titled &quot;God Spoke to Me&quot; (1967), people came to live at the Caravan Park, eventually forming the &#x27;Findhorn Trust&#x27; and the &#x27;Findhorn Community&#x27;.

From 1969, following Eileen&#x27;s guidance, Peter Caddy slowly devolved his day-to-day command. David Spangler became co-director of Education almost immediately after he arrived in 1970, which resulted in the gradual transformation into a centre of residential spiritual education with a permanent staff of over 100, and the establishment of the Findhorn Foundation in 1972. The following year. David Spangler and Maclean, with several other Findhorn Foundation members, left to found the Lorian Association near Seattle. By 1979 Peter and Eileen&#x27;s marriage had disintegrated, and he left the Foundation. Eileen Caddy remained, and in 2004 was awarded an OBE. Peter Caddy died in a car crash in Germany on 18 February 1994. Eileen Caddy died at home on 13 December 2006. Maclean continued to give talks and workshops worldwide, visiting Findhorn regularly, and in August 2009 returned to Findhorn to live. She retired from public life in 2010.

==2021 fire, lockdown and transitions==
In April 2021, a fire destroyed the Findhorn community centre and its sanctuary building. The fire was deliberately caused by the community centre’s manager who had lived and worked at Findhorn for 16 years. Scotland’s &quot;Sunday Post&quot; newspaper reported that he had been distressed to learn that because of restructuring plans he was one of 50 staff who would have to leave Findhorn, where many had worked long-term for housing, food and minimal wages. This restructuring was only partly due to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the newspaper&#x27;s report. It quoted other redundant Findhorn staff as affirming widespread “hurt and anger” within the Findhorn community about these restructuring plans.   

The fire and the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns forced the Foundation to cease its educational activities by September 2023, marking a significant shift in its operational model. As the Foundation grappled with the financial strain of these compounded crises, it announced the decision to sell part of its properties in an effort to stabilize its financial situation. Further, it stated in July 2023 that it might have to let go of some of its 50 staff members.

== A centre of education ==

In September 2023 the Findhorn Foundation stopped offering courses, conferences, and educational programmes. An ethnographic study in the 1990s looked in detail at the &#x27;Experience Week&#x27;, which it called &quot;the main entry point into Findhorn&#x27;s ethos and lifestyle&quot;, noted that over 5,000 people attended Findhorn&#x27;s courses annually, and called the Foundation an example of contemporary religious individualism.

A theatre and concert hall known as the Universal Hall was built at the former caravan park site, known as The Park, between the years 1974 and 1984. The musical group The Waterboys, who had performed concerts in the hall, named their album &quot;Universal Hall&quot; after the structure.

==Organisation==

===Community===

The Foundation has been called a &quot;spiritual utopian community&quot;. The community includes an arts centre, shop, pottery, bakery, publishing company, printing company and other charitable organisations. All aim to practice the founding principles of the community and together make up the New Findhorn Association (NFA). The NFA was formed in 1999 to provide a structure for all the people and organisations in the community. It includes people from within a 50-mile radius of The Park, at Findhorn. Each year a council and two listener-conveners are elected by the membership of the NFA, who organise monthly community meetings to decide upon community-wide issues. By 2011, the NFA consisted of &quot;320 members and 30 organisations&quot;. These included for example the Findhorn Press, the Phoenix Community Stores, the Trees for Life organisation, and the various educational centres including the Findhorn Foundation itself.

===Management structure===

Each department is responsible for its own decisions. There is an 11-person &quot;Management Team&quot; which makes &quot;decisions which affect the organisation as a whole&quot;. The Management team consults with the council, which consists of approximately 40 &quot;committed members&quot; who &quot;meet regularly to discuss issues and participate in team-building activities&quot;. The management team is &quot;responsible to the Trustees of the Foundation&quot;. The Trustees meet 4 times per year.

Decisions are made meditatively by &quot;attunement&quot;, where &quot;each person does their best to find an inner state of mind in which goodwill is foremost and any outcome will be one which serves as the best for all.&quot; &quot;Most decisions are made unanimously or with a loyal minority.&quot; Failing this, decisions can be passed with a 90% majority vote; decisions that do not reach this threshold are given time &quot;for more information to be gathered&quot;, and the proposals are presented again later.

==Ecovillage==

Since the 1980s numerous organisations have started up in the vicinity of Findhorn which have an affiliation of some kind with the Findhorn Foundation. These include Ekopia, Moray Steiner School, the Phoenix Community Store, Trees for Life (Scotland) and The Isle of Erraid. Collectively they now form an ecovillage intended to demonstrate a positive model of a viable, sustainable human and planetary future. By 2005, Findhorn Ecovillage had around 450 resident members, and its residents were claimed to have the lowest recorded ecological footprint of any community in the industrialised world, at half of the UK average.

Physically, Findhorn Ecovillage is based at The Park, where the Foundation&#x27;s belief in sustainability is expressed in the built environment with &#x27;ecological&#x27; houses, innovative use of building materials such as local stone and straw bales, and applied technology in the Living Machine sewage treatment facility and electricity-generating wind turbines. The Ecovillage is intended to be a tangible demonstration of the links between the spiritual, social, ecological and economic aspects of life, for use as a teaching resource. It is a founder member of the Global Ecovillage Network (GEN) a non-profit organisation that links together a diverse worldwide movement of autonomous ecovillages and related projects. The Ecovillage project has received Best Practice designation from the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat).

==Relationships with other NGOs==
The Findhorn Foundation is a member of the Conference of Non-Governmental Organizations (CONGO), attends the Sustainable Development Committee meetings and is a founding member of the following NGO groups active at the UN Headquarters in New York: The Earth Values Caucus, The Spiritual Caucus, and The NGO Committee on Spirituality, Values and Global Concerns.

A new sustainable development training facility, CIFAL Findhorn was launched in September 2006. This is a joint initiative between The Moray Council, the Global Ecovillage Network, the Findhorn Foundation and UNITAR.

<doc id="425836" wikidata="Q4116603" url="?curid=425836" title="St. Clair, Ontario">
<text>St. Clair is a township in southwestern Ontario, Canada, immediately south of Sarnia in Lambton County, along the eastern shores of the St. Clair River.

== Communities ==
The township comprises the communities of Avonry, Babys Point, Becher, Bickford, Bradshaw, Brigden, Charlemont, Colinville, Courtright, Corunna, Cromar, Duthill, Frog Point, Froomfield, Kimball, Ladysmith, Moore Centre, Mooretown, Osborne, Payne, Port Lambton, Seckerton, Sombra, Sykeston, Thornyhurst, Vye&#x27;s Grove, Waubuno, West Becher, Wilkesport. The township administrative offices are located in Mooretown.

== History ==

The Ojibwe First Nation occupied this area for thousands of years prior to European encounter. As French traders, missionaries and farmers spread out from the Atlantic coast along the waterways, some French and French-Canadian colonists began to settle here in the mid-1700s. They rented land from the Ojibwe. To the south of the Detroit River, their early community was known as &quot;Petite Côte&quot;. Early maps show the typical colonial French lots, with narrow frontage along the river. They were located near a Jesuit mission village and a Huron settlement.

===Corunna===

In 1823, Lord Hicks was directed on an expedition to survey lands. He surveyed the town site of Corunna, naming it after the Battle of Corunna in Spain.

Later, William Carr Beresford was sent on a mission to find a suitable capital for a future union between the colonies of Upper Canada (Ontario) and Lower Canada (Quebec). He had also served in Spain during the Napoleonic Wars. The town&#x27;s name indirectly honors Beresford&#x27;s commander in that battle, Sir John Moore (general), who was mortally wounded at Corunna, Spain, in a fight with French forces as the English tried to embark on their ships for retreat to Great Britain.

Corunna was not chosen for the new capital, as it was considered vulnerable due to being too close to the Canada–US border. In the 1820s–1830s, the prospect of an Irish Fenian raid from the United States was considered a serious threat to the British colonies. Today, a small stone cairn stands along Baird Street, near the CSX north-south train track that divides the town. The cairn marks the spot where Beresford&#x27;s survey crews had proposed to build St. George&#x27;s Square, an area to house parliament buildings.

Beresford named most of the streets after military officers who had earlier served with him. The dimensions of these streets that now make up the downtown: Beckwith, Beresford, Baird, Fane, Paget, Lyndoch, Cameron, Bentinck, Colborne, Hill, Murray, etc., follow some of the original specifications set out by Beresford&#x27;s survey crew as part of the plans to create a capital.

From the 1820s on in the nineteenth century, decades after the British took over Canada after their defeat of France in the Seven Years&#x27; War, Corunna was settled by a wave of British settlers, particularly Scots-Irish. One early settler was James Cruickshank, who settled in 1834 south of Corunna on the Eighth Line near Kimball Side Road. A plaque to commemorate his early contribution to the township was installed in a Corunna park on Beresford Street, on land donated by his descendants. New residents developed grist mills, saw mills, and taverns, all considered integral to the new community.

Entrepreneurs wanted to build a canal through Corunna, but it was abandoned soon after construction, as operators could not maintain consistent water levels. The early history of the town is spotty, but some accounts suggest a brewery briefly operated here.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the village supported some local retail stores. A general store was on the west side of Lyndoch, north of Hill, where an Esso station later stood. The site now has a dentist&#x27;s office. Billy Locke ran Billy&#x27;s Bunnery. Billy Garoch had another general store on the Lyndoch and Hill corner where the liquor store is now. This later was known as MacRae&#x27;s store and closed in the early 1960s. Billy Garoch also had an ice house to the east of his store, in the old school that had been moved from Lyndoch near the present Roses Variety Store.

Some historic structures remain in Corunna, revealing its past. The town&#x27;s Roman Catholic church, St. Joseph&#x27;s, was built in 1862. Its wooden structure is bolstered by enormous trunks of the area&#x27;s original trees, which were squared off and put in place to build the church. Several 1800s-vintage homes remain in the town as well.

===Baby&#x27;s Point===
Baby&#x27;s Point is the extreme southern point of Lambton County. Kayla Baby owned all the land from this point, and all of Port Lambton site, which he inherited from his grandfather in 1742. His brother James Baby also lived there. In 1848 Edward Kelly was appointed as the first postmaster at Baby&#x27;s Point.

After 1812, more French Canadians started to settle along the St. Clair River. They did not have legal title to the land, as the border with the United States was under dispute by Great Britain. When Irish immigrants began to move in about 1833, the French sold their squatters rights. The First Nations people, long the original inhabitants of all this area, were prevented by the Province from selling their land without official approval.

Soon after 1812, the Province arranged for legal land sales to people along the St. Clair River. In the spring of 1820, Duncan McDonald built the first frame house. A post office opened in 1871, and was at one time known as Lambton Village. Rural mail was first delivered in 1908, and all mail routes completed in January 1909.

The first Sacred Heart Church was built at Baby&#x27;s Butt Point around 1825. It burned. Fr. Monocq was drowned January 12, 1861, and his body was found in 1862. Fr. Monocq was buried beneath the altar of the first Port Lambton Church. His memorial plaque was on the right hand of the side altar. The Sacred Heart Church, Port Lambton, was built in 1877. Martin Regan was the first person baptised there, in December 1877. In the 1960s the church was demolished, replaced by a new church built on the same site in 1964.

== Climate ==
St. Clair has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfa/Dfb&quot;) with cold winters, and warm, humid summers. Winters are cold with a maximum of during the day and during the night in January. Winters are variable with mild spells of weather pushing temperatures above and occasionally above and arctic air masses pushing temperatures below though these events are rare with only one day above and 1 or 2 days below . St. Clair receives and since it is not located in the snowbelt region, snow cover is intermittent throughout the season. Summers are warm and humid with a July high of and a low of . In an average summer, temperatures above occur on 20 days per year. The average annual precipitation is which is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year and there are 136 days with measureable precipitation.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, St. Clair had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


== Education ==
St. Clair Township has schools in several of its communities.

Brigden houses Brigden Public School, Corunna hosts of three schools - two public schools (Sir John Moore Community School, opened in 2000 and Colonel Cameron Public School) and one Catholic school (St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic School), the latter of which opened in September 1992. Colborne Street School was a public school on Colborne Street, that closed in 2002. Murray Street School (K to 6) on Murray Street was closed earlier. Hill Street School (originally a Jr. room and Sr. room, a teacher&#x27;s room and principal&#x27;s office, then later a Gr.7–8 school), the earliest school still standing in Corunna, located at the corner of Hill and Lyndock, was closed several years ago as well, and is now an O.P.P. station. Students who attended Colborne, transferred to Colonel Cameron or Sir John Moore. The building currently housing Colonel Cameron was previously Father Gerald LaBelle Catholic School, which was open between 1976 and the early 2000s.

Corunna has not developed any high schools, though the topic has been debated in the past.

Port Lambton is home to two schools - Riverview Central School and Sacred Heart Catholic Elementary School.

Mooretown has a school named Mooretown Courtright Public School.

==St. Clair Parkway==
The presence of the St. Clair Parkway has given St. Clair Township a reputation for its parks along the riverfront. The head office had been located in Corunna since 1968. As of February 2006, the St. Clair Parkway has been disbanded and the parks have been handed over to the municipalities where they are located.

<doc id="425838" wikidata="Q5173837" url="?curid=425838" title="Cosanti">
<text>Cosanti is the gallery and studio of Italian-American architect Paolo Soleri, serving as his residence until his death in 2013. Located in Paradise Valley, Arizona, U.S., it is open to the public. Cosanti is marked by terraced landscaping, experimental earth-formed concrete structures, and sculptural wind-bells.

Soleri and his wife Colly established their residence there in 1956 on a five-acre site just a few miles from Taliesin West, where Soleri had studied under Frank Lloyd Wright ten years earlier. Built on the outskirts of Scottsdale, it is surrounded by a wealthy suburban neighborhood. In Italian, the name Cosanti &quot;is a combination of the words for &#x27;object&#x27; and &#x27;before,&#x27; and it means, &#x27;There are things more important than objects.&#x27;&quot;

In 1970, Soleri outgrew the site. He had coined &quot;arcology&quot; by combining &quot;architecture&quot; and &quot;ecology&quot;; then, combining &quot;arcology&quot; with &quot;Cosanti&quot;, he founded Arcosanti, an &quot;urban laboratory&quot; in the desert seventy miles north, for which he became famous. As students and the frontier of development moved there, Cosanti became the headquarters and namesake of Soleri&#x27;s foundation.

The structures at Cosanti include the original &quot;Earth House&quot;, a student dormitory, outdoor studios, performance space, a swimming pool, gift shop, and Soleri&#x27;s residence. All are set amidst courtyards, terraces and garden paths.

Many structures are partly underground and surrounded by mounds of earth for insulation, moderating their interior temperatures year-round. Soleri designed and built south-facing apses (partial domes) as passive energy collectors that collect light and heat in the lower winter sun, deflecting it and creating shade in the higher summer sun. The swimming pool and several other structures have southern exposures to maximize the warmth of the winter sun.

Cosanti predates the concept of arcology, but many principles of arcology were first implemented at Cosanti. Most of the structures were built with variations on earthcasting. Concrete was poured over mounds of densely packed earth; the earth was excavated after the concrete solidified. A modified earthcasting technique is also used to craft the bronze and ceramic wind-bells produced at Cosanti and Arcosanti on weekday mornings.
