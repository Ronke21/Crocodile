<text>Kylie Minogue is the fifth studio album recorded by Australian singer Kylie Minogue. Deconstruction released it in the United Kingdom on 19 September 1994, while a release was issued through Mushroom Records in Australia on the same date. After leaving Pete Waterman Entertainment, Minogue wanted to establish her credibility and signed with the independent record label Deconstruction in early 1993. She became involved with a diverse group of collaborators in order to experiment with different sounds. After generally unsuccessful sessions with Saint Etienne and The Rapino Brothers, Minogue collaborated with new producers including Brothers in Rhythm, M People, Farley &amp; Heller, and Jimmy Harry.

Musically, &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; is a dance-pop album also containing elements of R&amp;B and adult contemporary music. Lyrically, the album touches on themes of love, seduction and womanhood. Music critics praised the production and Minogue&#x27;s vocals, while observing the start of a new phase in Minogue&#x27;s career. The album peaked in the top five in the United Kingdom and Australia, alongside being certified gold in both countries. It attained top 40 positions in Switzerland, Sweden and Scotland. Minogue received three nominations at the ARIA Music Awards of 1995 for her work on &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot;, winning Best Video for &quot;Put Yourself In My Place&quot;.

To promote the album, a limited edition coffee-table book photographed by Ellen von Unwerth and Katerina Jebb was released to highfliers. Three singles were released—&quot;Confide in Me&quot;, &quot;Put Yourself in My Place&quot; and &quot;Where Is the Feeling?&quot;—each of which peaked inside the top 20 in the UK; the first two reached the top 20 in Australia. Minogue was involved with two film projects at the time &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; dropped, which delayed the promotional process several times. The album was re-issued in Europe in 2018 and returned to the UK Albums Chart and the Scottish Albums Chart.

==Background==
In 1991, Minogue released her fourth studio album under Pete Waterman Limited (PWL), titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Get to It&quot;. The album was recorded after songwriter Matt Aitken had left Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW) earlier that year, which left Pete Waterman and Mike Stock to write and produce the album. Minogue, who co-wrote six tracks with the producers for the album, was disappointed with the output. She felt SAW had reverted to formulaic sounds and by the time &quot;Let&#x27;s Get to It&quot; came out, &quot;the magic [had] gone and the record sank quickly&quot;. By the end of 1992, PWL did not renew their contract with Minogue, believing the singer &quot;was [not] moving in a direction that was going to be successful&quot;, according to PWL co-owner David Howells. Minogue&#x27;s final release under PWL was &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1992), which debuted at number one in the United Kingdom and reached number three in Australia.

After the split, Minogue wanted to establish her credibility and refused to fall back into the same market as PWL. She turned down several major record labels, among them EMI and A&amp;M, and subsequently signed to indie label Deconstruction in early 1993. Deconstruction was known for being an innovative part of the dance scene, but it was unusual for a mainstream pop artist to sign an indie label contract. Deconstruction founder Pete Hadfield found Minogue to be a driven and creative artist, who needs to show her more experimental side. The label promised creative freedom, both musically and artistically, which persuaded Minogue. &quot;I liked [Destruction&#x27;s] attitude, I quite liked their arrogance, and I liked the vision they had. [...] There wouldn&#x27;t be much point in leaving PWL and going somewhere exactly the same, so it was a big change&quot;, Minogue said.

==Recording and development==
===1993: Early sessions===

Hadfield intended to push Minogue towards a more unconventional approach to dance music. As work began on her new music, an early meeting with Deconstruction took place to discuss which direction Minogue intended to pursue. She decided to experiment with different sounds rather than record more pop songs. Minogue took an active role in planning for the album and sought a diverse group of collaborators to work with, including both mainstream and underground talents. Hadfield and Quentin Harrison of &quot;PopMatters&quot; referred to the process as the rebranding of Minogue as a pop artist. In an interview with &quot;NME&quot;, Keith Cameron wrote that Minogue &quot;talks in the amazed tones of a blind child who has just rediscovered the gift of sight&quot;, with regard to the making of the album.

Early recording sessions for &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; took place in 1993, with help from Saint Etienne and The Rapino Brothers. However, most of the tracks were deemed to be taking Minogue in the wrong direction and were scrapped. Some tracks were subsequently used as B-sides on singles and bonus tracks for different editions of &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot;. Bob Stanley of Saint Etienne remarked that the singer&#x27;s camp &quot;had no idea what they wanted, apart from being different from the SAW stuff&quot;, though he expressed his amazement at her powerful voice that SAW&#x27;s double tracking had masked. The first recording Minogue did after she signed with Deconstruction was a new version of Saint Etienne&#x27;s third single &quot;Nothing Can Stop Us&quot; (1991). Minogue had written eight songs with the Rapino Brothers; all but one–&quot;Automatic Love&quot;–were scrapped. &quot;Automatic Love&quot; ended up on the tracklist of &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; and was the only song to list Minogue as a songwriter.

Several songwriters and producers unsuccessfully approached Minogue to work with them during the production process. American singer-songwriter Prince invited Minogue to his studio for a social visit after she met him backstage at Earl&#x27;s Court, London. She handed him some lyrics she had written for a song entitled &quot;Baby Doll&quot;; Prince managed to finish the song and record Minogue&#x27;s lyrics on a cassette tape but never properly recorded it. Minogue did suggest it to the label, but they were not into the track. Minogue and Lenny Kravitz had talked about working together, but he was busy making his fourth studio album &quot;Mama Said&quot; (1991), and composing Vanessa Paradis&#x27;s 1992 self-titled album. The singer and Bobby Gillespie of Primal Scream had talked about working together in 1992, before two other band members discussed doing a different version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight It, Feel It&quot; (from &quot;Screamadelica&quot;, 1991) with Minogue, but their record label wanted the band to finish their 1994 album first. British groups the Beloved and the Auteurs wrote at least one song for &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot;, but the material did not work out. Nick Cave had talked about a song written especially for Minogue to sing from the point of view of a murdered woman. The song, &quot;Where the Wild Roses Grow&quot;, was released as a single in 1995 and later appeared on Cave&#x27;s &quot;Murder Ballads&quot; album in 1996.

===1993–1994: Later development===
Hadfield and fellow Deconstruction co-founder Keith Blackhurst were friends with Steve Anderson and Dave Seaman, an electronic duo known as Brothers in Rhythm. Brothers in Rhythm had been involved with Minogue on a remix of &quot;Finer Feelings&quot;, a single taken from &quot;Let&#x27;s Get to It&quot;. When they heard Minogue had signed with Deconstruction, the duo called Blackhurst and asked to collaborate, despite having no prior experience writing for others. Minogue met Brothers in Rhythm at DMC Studios in Slough, where they had a meeting and set up the original sessions. Anderson said that Minogue was inspiring and open to trying out different sounds, while the label had faith in them and did not want to limit creativity. Minogue&#x27;s stylist William Baker found her to be the &quot;perfect vehicle&quot; for the duo&#x27;s hybrids: &quot;Her vocal range and willingness to experiment musically meant that Steve and Dave could push the envelope further.&quot;
Minogue traveled from her residence in Chelsea and tried songs out at DMC Studios for months. The producers initially had their work cut out for them because of Minogue&#x27;s nasal vocals, while she gained confidence in her vocals throughout the course of recording &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot;. Their first efforts resulted in &quot;Confide in Me&quot;, a song that came together within an hour. Minogue recorded the original demo in one take, which ended up being used on the final recording. The producers were pleased with the result, calling it &quot;without a shadow of doubt the best [Minogue track] we were involved with&quot;. A cover version of Prefab Sprout&#x27;s &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Love Me&quot; was recorded in only one take, as the producers wanted to experiment with Minogue&#x27;s musical boundaries. Brothers in Rhythm was enlisted as the album&#x27;s chief producer and produced four of the tracks: &quot;Where Is the Feeling?&quot; (originally recorded by Within A Dream in 1993), &quot;Automatic Love&quot; (a rework from material with the Rapino Brothers), &quot;Confide in Me&quot; and &quot;Dangerous Game&quot; (both songs written and produced by the duo). Another rework from the material with the Rapino Brothers is &quot;Love Is on the Line&quot;, however it remains commercially unreleased. In London, the songs were recorded in Sarm West Studios.

Jimmy Harry wrote and produced &quot;Put Yourself in My Place&quot;, written specially for Minogue, and &quot;If I Was Your Lover&quot;. These songs, recorded in New York City at the Axis Studios, Power Station and Whorga Musica, were the only tracks recorded outside the UK. Minogue recorded a song entitled &quot;Intuition&quot; during these sessions, which was shelved until 2019, when Harry gave the demo to American singer Liz for her album &quot;Planet Y2K&quot;. Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, better known as Pet Shop Boys, were approached by Minogue&#x27;s camp after the pair finished work on &quot;Very&quot; (1993). They declined initially, but Lowe came up with a set of chords that Tennant found similar to Minogue&#x27;s previous work with SAW and suggested they turn it into a song for her. The demo for &quot;Falling&quot; was sent to Deconstruction, where it was reworked by Fire Island, an English music duo made up of Pete Heller and Terry Farley. Tennant found the result very different from the original demo, saying, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t really have the same tune in it, for instance, and they haven&#x27;t put the chorus in, but I suppose that&#x27;s very modern.&quot; Minogue&#x27;s label mate M People produced &quot;Time Will Pass You By&quot; for &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; but could not commit to do more because of a busy schedule. Gerry DeVeaux, songwriter and Kravitz&#x27;s cousin, produced and co-wrote &quot;Surrender&quot; with composer Charlie Mole. Three of the songs on the album are cover versions of largely unknown tracks: &quot;Where Has The Love Gone?&quot;, &quot;Time Will Pass You By&quot; and &quot;Where Is the Feeling?&quot;.

==Musical styles==
&quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; is primarily a dance-pop album that integrates elements of R&amp;B and adult contemporary music. Chris True of AllMusic wrote that the album is a remarkable change from Minogue&#x27;s previous teen pop material with an &quot;atmosphere and style in the songs that wasn&#x27;t there on &quot;Let&#x27;s Get to It&quot;&quot;. In the biography &quot;Kylie: Naked&quot; (2012), Nigel Goodall and Jenny Stanley-Clarke describe the album as a collection of &quot;upbeat dance tracks, lightweight funky numbers and smoochy ballads&quot;. Music critics extensively commented on the album&#x27;s musical diversity. Paul Bowler of &quot;Record Collector&quot; noted the album &quot;frolics gaily amongst the myriad contemporary dance styles of &#x27;94&quot;. Ian Gormely of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; found influences from house, techno and new jack swing, while an editor of Be With Records pointed out the ambient, Balearic and R&amp;B elements. Portions of hip hop, acid jazz and club music were also listed by Harrison.

The album opens with &quot;Confide in Me&quot;, a song incorporating elements of indie pop and Middle Eastern instrumentation like strings and percussion. The opening part of the track features an arrangement by musician Will Malone and a piano section by Anderson, which was performed on a Bösendorfer. Frankie Knuckles and David Morales&#x27; classic musical elements influenced Anderson when he produced Minogue&#x27;s cover of &quot;Where Is the Feeling?&quot;. The producers added live piano, guitar and percussion to the album&#x27;s version of the song. The disco and acid jazz-based track was compared with the work of British acts such as The Brand New Heavies, Jamiroquai and Incognito. &quot;Dangerous Game&quot; and &quot;Automatic Love&quot; are prominently driven by string instruments.

&quot;Surrender&quot; is a seductive slow jam track, with Balearic pop, jazz and R&amp;B-influences. Cinquemani compared &quot;Surrender&quot; to a less sensual rendition of songs recorded by Tia Carrere for &quot;Dreams&quot; (1993). It is followed by the mid-tempo pop-funk &quot;If I Was Your Lover&quot;. &quot;Put Yourself in My Place&quot; is a melancholy quiet storm power ballad with trip hop beats that resembles late 1980s American R&amp;B tracks. Produced by Heller and Farley, &quot;Where Has The Love Gone&quot; and &quot;Falling&quot; are tempestuous uptempo tracks that run over six minutes each. Bowler compared both tracks to the work of American producer Larry Heard. Minogue whispers the lyrics on &quot;Falling&quot;, a house slow-burner with the bass-heavy rhythm and high backing vocals. The album ends with &quot;Time Will Pass You By&quot;, is a sophisticated, grinning piano-house song.

==Themes and vocals==
The album touches on themes of love and womanhood. 
Robbert Tilli and Machgiel Bakke of &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; compared the sensual tone throughout the album to Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Erotica&quot; (1992). &quot;Confide in Me&quot; talks about Minogue&#x27;s earnest seduction and manipulating people to confide into her. English musician Edward Barton is credited as a co-writer under the name Owain Barton, along with Anderson and Seaman, because of the interpolations from his song &quot;It&#x27;s a Fine Day&quot; (1983). &quot;Put Yourself in My Place&quot; is a plaintive appeal to a former lover who had fallen for someone else. &quot;Automatic Love&quot; is a chilled-out track that contains technology references. Minogue sings &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel you enter / In my main menu / But every time I touch the key / The screen is showing you.&quot; &quot;Where Has the Love Gone?&quot; contains dainty lines like &quot;I&#x27;m a woman and I&#x27;ve got my vanity&quot;. The closer track, &quot;Time Will Pass You By&quot;, encapsulates Minogue&#x27;s trademark &quot;joie de vivre&quot; message: not taking life for granted and enjoying it to its fullest.

Minogue adapted more breathy and resonant vocals on the album. She sings in a wide range of notes while adding sighs, murmurs, and whispers on several tracks. The album also features sitars and subtle backing vocals. John Mangan of &quot;The Age&quot; felt that her vocals are &quot;more breathy, more swooping, more assured than ever&quot;. Caroline Sullivan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that the frailty of her vocals &quot;impart a more appealing vulnerability.&quot; Jon Casimir of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; noticed her Mid-Atlantic accent on the album, with the exception of a monologue on &quot;If I Was Your Lover&quot;, which he thought sounds more American than Madonna does.

==Artwork and title==

British photographer Rankin shot the artwork for &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot;, with the assistance of British stylist Katie Grand. Mark Farrow was selected to design the cover. Deconstruction paid for Rankin and Grand to fly to Los Angeles and do a photoshoot with Minogue for &quot;Dazed &amp; Confused&quot;, a British fashion magazine that Rankin founded in 1991. Grand took part in directing and styling fashion shoots for the magazine during the time. The shoot for an inlay section called &quot;Kylie Bible&quot; lasted for around six or seven hours outside a film studio. Grand tried to make Minogue&#x27;s image more androgynous. Deconstruction approved the photographs and kept one image for later use on the album cover.

The black-and-white cover shows a barefoot Minogue, licking her lips and crouching low, with her hair brushed back behind her ears. She wears a dark Paul Smith trouser suit and a pair of glasses. In the biography &quot;Kylie&quot; (2014), Sean Smith says Minogue posed like &quot;a leopard sizing up her prey&quot; while wearing Clark Kent glasses, further writing that the cover is remarkably different from her previous ones. Robbie Daw of &quot;Idolator&quot; described Minogue as a seductive nerd, while Goodall and Clarke compared her to the character of Miss Moneypenny. Tamasin Doe of &quot;Evening Standard&quot; noted the cover reflects the trend of wearing glasses to be taken seriously, and linked Minogue&#x27;s solemn image to the television series &quot;Joe 90&quot;. Christian Guiltenane of &quot;Classic Pop&quot; comments that Minogue&#x27;s image had changed considerably in just five years, saying the shots are a mix of &quot;sultry poses, avant garde styling and sex&quot;. A replica of the green taffeta suit that Minogue worn for the cover shot was donated to the Cultural Gifts Program of the Arts Centre Melbourne.

&quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; is the second studio album named after the singer, following her debut &quot;Kylie&quot; in 1988. Minogue said that the album was named after her because she wanted to introduce her new sound &quot;that other people might copy&quot;. Smith feels the simple title might seem to be unimaginative, but it shows Minogue eager to start over and reintroduce herself to the public. Australian programme &quot;Rage&quot; wrote that the title completes &quot;the &#x27;rebirth&#x27; feel [that Minogue] had established by leaving PWL&quot;. Charles Shaar Murray of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; suggested the artwork shows two different sides of Minogue, an intelligent modern woman with deep desires. Bowler commented that by subtly adding Minogue&#x27;s surname to the title, as well as her formal outfit and lascivious pose on the cover, she successfully announced &quot;the arrival of a more sophisticated artist&quot; who wanted to be taken seriously.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; was released on 19 September 1994 in the UK and other European countries by Deconstruction, and in Australia simultaneously by Mushroom Records. In Japan, it was released on 21 October 1994 by the former of the two labels with two bonus tracks: &quot;Love Is Waiting&quot; (written by Tracy Ackerman, Mike Percy and Tim Lever of Dead or Alive) and &quot;Nothing Can Stop Us&quot;. Deconstruction issued the album in Canada in 1995, featuring an alternate artwork and a franglais version of &quot;Confide in Me&quot;, known as &quot;Fie-toi à moi&quot;. Following the release of &quot;Enjoy Yourself&quot; (1989), Minogue failed to find an audience in the United States. American independent label Imago Records intended to release &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; in the US, with a commercial release of &quot;Confide in Me&quot; in November 1994. The label, however, was facing serious financial problems and quickly parted ways with BMG in 1995. Imago withdrew all current releases, including the album, which was scheduled for Spring 1995.

&quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; was re-released in Australia in 1998 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Mushroom Records. BMG and Mushroom released a special edition of &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; with remastered tracks in May 2003, which contains remixes, B-sides, and a previously unreleased track, titled &quot;Dangerous Overture&quot;. The album was later reissued on vinyl for the first time, as a double vinyl, by Be With Records in 2016 in the UK; and in 2018 by BMG as a white vinyl exclusively through Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket chain in European countries. Several album tracks and two unreleased tracks (&quot;Gotta Move On&quot; and &quot;Difficult by Design&quot;) from &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; appear on &quot;Hits+&quot; (2000), which was released in Europe.

Minogue promoted the album with a limited-edition coffee-table book that was not commercially available in October 1994. The minimalist photographs are mostly black-and-white, depicting a stripped-back Minogue. Ellen von Unwerth shot the photographs in New York City while Minogue recorded there. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t my choice to get down to a négligé but that&#x27;s the way Ellen shoots&quot;, Minogue said. Photographer Katerina Jebb and Baker, Minogue&#x27;s frequent collaborators, met for the first time and came up with a Debbie Harry-themed photoshoot for the book. Baker provided many old punk-style costumes for Minogue; among them was a 1970s sleeveless Marilyn Monroe T-shirt that once belonged to a staff member at Andy Warhol&#x27;s the Factory studio. The collection of images of Minogue in seductive poses and see-through costumes was compared to Madonna&#x27;s highly controversial &quot;Sex&quot; book (1992). Minogue defended herself by claiming that she had plans to do a coffee-table book before &quot;Sex&quot; came out, and that the book was inspired by Janet Jackson&#x27;s topless image on the cover of her 1993 self-titled album. She said: &quot;It would be incredibly foolish of me to try to copy Madonna. I&#x27;m just trying to fight through and find out who I am. That was the idea of putting the book together.&quot;

===Singles===

&quot;Confide in Me&quot;, the lead single from &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot;, was released in August 1994. Her covers of &quot;Nothing Can Stop Us&quot; and &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Love Me&quot;, alongside a 10-minute remix by Brothers in Rhythm, were included on the single&#x27;s B-side. In the US, Phillip Damien remixed the single, titled the &quot;Confession Mix&quot;, featuring his signature twisted loops and energetic beats; while Fire Island featured on a remix of &quot;Where Has The Love Gone?&quot; on the B-side. Black-and-white promotional photographs for &quot;Confide in Me&quot; saw Minogue sporting an afro. In the music video, directed by Paul Boyd, Minogue plays six different versions of herself, filming a commercial for a phone number and inviting viewers to call and reveal their secrets. &quot;Confide in Me&quot; was Minogue&#x27;s biggest international hit of the decade, debuting at number two in the UK, while reaching numbers 10 and 39 in France and on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart, respectively. In her native Australia, it spent four weeks at number one on the ARIA Singles Chart.

After the release of &quot;Confide in Me&quot;, Minogue was busy promoting &quot;Street Fighter&quot; (1994), her first Hollywood-funded project since &quot;The Delinquents&quot; (1989). The second single, &quot;Put Yourself in My Place&quot;, was released in November. Rankin photographed the cover art featuring Minogue posing with headphones, to represent a &quot;serious&quot; approach to her music. Directed by Kier McFarlane, the music video recreates the opening sequence of the classic Jane Fonda film &quot;Barbarella&quot; (1968), while Minogue performs a slow striptease inside a spacecraft. &quot;Put Yourself in My Place&quot; narrowly missed the top 10, reached number 11 in both Australia and the UK.

&quot;If I Was Your Lover&quot; was intended as the follow-up single after &quot;Put Yourself in My Place&quot; in the US, but the plan was scrapped. &quot;Where Is the Feeling?&quot; was released as the third and final single in July 1995, seven months after the release of the second single. &quot;Where Is the Feeling?&quot; was planned initially as the follow-up single to &quot;Confide In Me&quot;, before being scheduled for release in April 1995 but was delayed again when Minogue was filming &quot;Bio-Dome&quot; (1996) in the US. Brothers In Rhythm handled the remix for the single release, replacing the &quot;bright and breezy vocal&quot; of the album version with a murmured verse and a bass heavy backing track. Mixes by Felix da Housecat and Morales were also included. Minogue appeared with red hair, which was dyed specially for her role in &quot;Bio-Dome&quot;, during the promotional process for &quot;Where Is the Feeling?&quot;. The music video, also directed by McFarlane, saw Minogue being pursued through the water by an ominous figure. The single only reached number 16 in the UK and number 31 in Australia. Minogue once considered &quot;Time Will Pass You By&quot; as the concluding single; instead, she worked with Cave on the single &quot;Where the Wild Roses Grow&quot; and released it in late 1995.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; was met with generally positive reviews from music critics, many of whom praising its production. Sullivan wrote that although multiple producers were involved, the album is &quot;absolutely cohesive, excellent dance-pop&quot;. Jonathan Bernstein of &quot;Spin&quot; and Mangan called it a polished piece of work, and singled out &quot;Confide in Me&quot; for praise. Writing for &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot;, Tilli and Bakke praised the overall quality and compared the album favourably to Janet Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Control&quot; (1986). Critics commented on the album&#x27;s length; Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; viewed its length as an embracement of club music that emulates classic 12&quot; house records. In a mixed review, Casimir felt that the album lacks of emphasis and its production is tailored made for the &quot;slickness-loving US market&quot;.

Multiple reviewers highlighted Minogue&#x27;s improved vocals and her mature perceptions. Cinquemani credited her for delivering a sensual and understated performance, while True felt she &quot;wanted to sound grown-up, and she pulls it off with ease&quot;. Sharing the same sentiments were Sullivan and Mangan, who felt Minogue successfully transformed herself to a more sensual and credible artist. Levine opined that the early critics of her vocals would be surprised with her delivery on &quot;Automatic Love&quot;. Murray commented that the songs were made to fit her thin voice, which often goes shrill when raised. Writing for &quot;Playboy&quot;, Marc Andrews found the album mature enough but the producers tried too hard to push Minogue&#x27;s limited vocal range into soul diva territory.

In their retrospect reviews, Cinquemani and True interpreted the album as a creative and stylish statement for the second phase of Minogue&#x27;s career; the former critic also ranked it Minogue&#x27;s ninth-best studio album, praising its mid-tempo material. Levine and Oliver Hurley of &quot;Classic Pop&quot; commented that the sophisticated and cohesive record is unmarked by the passing years. Harrison deemed &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; a major leap of progress and compared it favourably to Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; (1994); he concluded that these two records have &quot;rippled through Madonna and Minogue&#x27;s legacies, career-wise and artistically&quot;. Bowler commented that the 2016 reissue of &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; was especially apposite in the contemporary well-crafted pop scene by the likes of Taylor Swift and Carly Rae Jepsen. The album was Minogue&#x27;s only studio album, apart from &quot;Let&#x27;s Get to It&quot;, to receive a two-star rating from British writer Colin Larkin in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; (2011), who classified it as &quot;disappointing&quot;, &quot;week or dull and not recommended&quot;.

Minogue received three nominations at the ARIA Music Awards of 1995 for her work on &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot;: Best Female Artist, Highest Selling Single for &quot;Confide In Me&quot; and Best Video for &quot;Put Yourself In My Place&quot;, winning the latter category.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; experienced moderate worldwide success. The album debuted and peaked at number four in the UK, becoming her fifth top-10 entry on the UK Albums Chart. It fell to number 13 the following week and spent a total of 20 weeks on the chart. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; gold within a month of the album&#x27;s release for selling over 100,000 copies in the UK. In 2016, the reissue of &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; sold out 500 copies on its initial pre-order run. Two years later, the 2018 reissue peaked at number 67 on the UK Albums Chart and number nine on the separate UK Independent Albums Chart on 28 September. The 2018 reissue also appeared on the Scottish Albums Chart, reaching number 30—&quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; had previously peaked at number 15 there after its original release in 1994. The album had sold 124,806 copies in the UK by October 2020.

In her native Australia, &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; debuted at number three and spent 11 weeks on the ARIA Albums chart. It was the 84th best-selling album of 1994 and was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for selling over 35,000 copies in Australia. &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; also peaked at number 39 in Sweden, number 33 in Switzerland, and number 78 in Germany during its 1998 release. In Japan, the album peaked at number 54 on the Oricon Albums Chart and had sold 23,440 copies by 2006.

<doc id="415070" wikidata="Q261503" url="?curid=415070" title="Chinese herbology">
<text>Chinese herbology () is the theory of traditional Chinese herbal therapy, which accounts for the majority of treatments in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). A &quot;Nature&quot; editorial described TCM as &quot;fraught with pseudoscience&quot;, and said that the most obvious reason why it has not delivered many cures is that the majority of its treatments have no logical mechanism of action.

The term herbology is misleading in the sense that, while plant elements are by far the most commonly used substances, animal, human, and mineral products are also used, some of which are poisonous. In the they are referred to as () which means &quot;poison-medicine&quot;. Paul U. Unschuld points out that this is similar etymology to the Greek and so he uses the term &quot;pharmaceutic&quot;. Thus, the term &quot;medicinal&quot; (instead of &quot;herb&quot;) is usually preferred as a translation for ().

Research into the effectiveness of traditional Chinese herbal therapy is of poor quality and often tainted by bias, with little or no rigorous evidence of efficacy. There are concerns over a number of potentially toxic Chinese herbs.

==History==
Chinese herbs have been used for centuries. Among the earliest literature are lists of prescriptions for specific ailments, exemplified by the manuscript &quot;Recipes for 52 Ailments&quot;, found in the Mawangdui which were sealed in 168BCE.

The first traditionally recognized herbalist is Shénnóng (, ), a mythical god-like figure, who is said to have lived around 2800BCE. He allegedly tasted hundreds of herbs and imparted his knowledge of medicinal and poisonous plants to farmers. His (, &quot;Shennong&#x27;s Materia Medica&quot;) is considered as the oldest book on Chinese herbal medicine. It classifies 365 species of roots, grass, woods, furs, animals and stones into three categories of herbal medicine:
# The &quot;superior&quot; category, which includes herbs effective for multiple diseases and are mostly responsible for maintaining and restoring the body balance. They have almost no unfavorable side-effects.
# A category comprising tonics and boosters, whose consumption must not be prolonged.
# A category of substances which must usually be taken in small doses, and for the treatment of specific diseases only.
The original text of Shennong&#x27;s &quot;Materia Medica&quot; has been lost; however, there are extant translations. The true date of origin is believed to fall into the late Western Han dynasty (i.e., the first century BCE).

The &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage Disorders and Miscellaneous Illnesses&quot; was collated by Zhang Zhongjing, also sometime at the end of the Han dynasty, between 196 and 220 CE. Focusing on drug prescriptions, it was the first medical work to combine Yinyang and the Five Phases with drug therapy. This formulary was also the earliest Chinese medical text to group symptoms into clinically useful &quot;patterns&quot; (, ) that could serve as targets for therapy. Having gone through numerous changes over time, it now circulates as two distinct books: the &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage Disorders&quot; and the &quot;Essential Prescriptions of the Golden Casket&quot;, which were edited separately in the eleventh century, under the Song dynasty.

Succeeding generations augmented these works, as in the (), a 7th-century Tang dynasty Chinese treatise on herbal medicine.

There was a shift in emphasis in treatment over several centuries. A section of the Huangdi Neijing Suwen including Chapter 74 was added by Wang Bing in his 765 edition. In which it says: &quot;Ruler of disease it called Sovereign, aid to Sovereign it called Minister, comply with Minister it called Envoy (Assistant), not upper lower three classes (qualities) it called.&quot; The last part is interpreted as stating that these three rulers are not the three classes of Shénnóng mentioned previously. This chapter in particular outlines a more forceful approach. Later on Zhang Zihe ( Zhang Cong-zhen, 1156–1228) is credited with founding the &#x27;Attacking School&#x27; which criticized the overuse of tonics.

Arguably the most important of these later works is the &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; (, ) compiled during the Ming dynasty by Li Shizhen, which is still used today for consultation and reference.

The use of Chinese herbs was popular during the medieval age in western Asian and Islamic countries. They were traded through the Silk Road from the East to the West. Cinnamon, ginger, rhubarb, nutmeg and cubeb are mentioned as Chinese herbs by medieval Islamic medical scholars Such as Rhazes (854–925 CE), Haly Abbas (930–994 CE) and Avicenna (980–1037 CE). There were also multiple similarities between the clinical uses of these herbs in Chinese and Islamic medicine.

==Raw materials==
There are roughly 13,000 medicinals used in China and over 100,000 medicinal recipes recorded in the ancient literature. Plant elements and extracts are by far the most common elements used. In the classic &quot;Handbook of Traditional Drugs&quot; from 1941, 517 drugs were listed – out of these, only 45 were animal parts, and 30 were minerals. For many plants used as medicinals, detailed instructions have been handed down not only regarding the locations and areas where they grow best, but also regarding the best timing of planting and harvesting them.

Some animal parts used as medicinals can be considered rather strange such as cows&#x27; gallstones.

Furthermore, the classic materia medica describes the use of 35 traditional Chinese medicines derived from the human body, including bones, fingernail, hairs, dandruff, earwax, impurities on the teeth, feces, urine, sweat, and organs, but most are no longer in use.

==Preparation==

===Decoction===

Typically, one batch of medicinals is prepared as a decoction of about 9 to 18 substances. Some of these are considered as main herbs, some as ancillary herbs; within the ancillary herbs, up to three categories can be distinguished. Some ingredients are added to cancel out toxicity or side-effects of the main ingredients; on top of that, some medicinals require the use of other substances as catalysts.

===Chinese patent medicine===

Chinese patent medicine () is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine. They are standardized herbal formulas. From ancient times, pills were formed by combining several herbs and other ingredients, which were dried and ground into a powder. They were then mixed with a binder and formed into pills by hand. The binder was traditionally honey. Modern teapills, however, are extracted in stainless steel extractors to create either a water decoction or water-alcohol decoction, depending on the herbs used. They are extracted at a low temperature (below ) to preserve essential ingredients. The extracted liquid is then further condensed, and some raw herb powder from one of the herbal ingredients is mixed in to form a herbal dough. This dough is then machine cut into tiny pieces, a small amount of excipients are added for a smooth and consistent exterior, and they are spun into pills.

These medicines are not patented in the traditional sense of the word. No one has exclusive rights to the formula. Instead, &quot;patent&quot; refers to the standardization of the formula. In China, all Chinese patent medicines of the same name will have the same proportions of ingredients, and manufactured in accordance with the PRC Pharmacopoeia, which is mandated by law. However, in western countries there may be variations in the proportions of ingredients in patent medicines of the same name, and even different ingredients altogether.

Several producers of Chinese herbal medicines are pursuing FDA clinical trials to market their products as drugs in U.S. and European markets.

===Chinese herbal extracts===
Chinese herbal extracts are herbal decoctions that have been condensed into a granular or powdered form. Herbal extracts, similar to patent medicines, are easier and more convenient for patients to take. The industry extraction standard is 5:1, meaning for every five pounds of raw materials, one pound of herbal extract is derived.

==Categorization==
There are several different methods to classify traditional Chinese medicinals:
* The Four Natures ()
* The Five Flavors ()
* The meridians ()
* The specific function.

===Four Natures===
The Four Natures are: hot (), warm (), cool (), cold () or neutral (). Hot and warm herbs are used to treat cold diseases, while cool and cold herbs are used to treat hot diseases.

===Five Flavors===
The Five Flavors, sometimes also translated as &quot;Five Tastes&quot;, are: acrid/pungent (), sweet (), bitter (), sour (), and salty (). Substances may also have more than one flavor, or none (i.e., a bland () flavor). Each of the Five Flavors corresponds to one of the zàng organs, which in turn corresponds to one of the Five Phases: A flavor implies certain properties and presumed therapeutic &quot;actions&quot; of a substance: saltiness &quot;drains downward and softens hard masses&quot;; sweetness is &quot;supplementing, harmonizing, and moistening&quot;; pungent substances are thought to induce sweat and act on qi and blood; sourness tends to be astringent () in nature; bitterness &quot;drains heat, purges the bowels, and eliminates dampness&quot;.

===Specific function===
These categories mainly include:
* exterior-releasing or exterior-resolving
* heat-clearing
* downward-draining or precipitating
* wind-damp-dispelling
* dampness-transforming
* promoting the movement of water and percolating dampness or dampness-percolating
* interior-warming
* qi-regulating or qi-rectifying
* dispersing food accumulation or food-dispersing
* worm-expelling
* stopping bleeding or blood-stanching
* quickening the Blood and dispelling stasis or blood-quickening or blood-moving.
* transforming phlegm, stopping coughing and calming wheezing or phlegm-transforming and cough- and panting-suppressing
* Spirit-quieting or Shen-calming.
* calming the Liver and expelling wind or liver-calming and wind-extinguishing
* orifice-opening
* supplementing or tonifying: this includes qi-supplementing, blood-nourishing, yin-enriching, and yang-fortifying.
* astriction-promoting or securing and astringing
* vomiting-inducing
* substances for external application

==Nomenclature==
Many herbs earn their names from their unique physical appearance. Examples of such names include (&quot;Radix cyathulae seu achyranthis&quot;), &#x27;cow&#x27;s knees,&#x27; which has big joints that might look like cow knees; (&quot;Fructificatio tremellae fuciformis&quot;), &#x27;white wood ear&#x27;, which is white and resembles an ear; (&quot;Rhizoma cibotii&quot;), &#x27;dog spine,&#x27; which resembles the spine of a dog.

===Color===
Color is not only a valuable means of identifying herbs, but in many cases also provides information about the therapeutic attributes of the herb. For example, yellow herbs are referred to as (yellow) or (gold). (&quot;Cortex Phellodendri&quot;) means &#x27;yellow fir,&quot; and (&quot;Flos Lonicerae&quot;) has the label &#x27;golden silver flower.&quot;

===Smell and taste===
Unique flavors define specific names for some substances. means &#x27;sweet,&#x27; so (&quot;Radix glycyrrhizae&quot;) is &#x27;sweet herb,&#x27; an adequate description for the licorice root. means &#x27;bitter&#x27;, thus (&quot;Sophorae flavescentis&quot;) translates as &#x27;bitter herb.&#x27;

===Geographic location===
The locations or provinces in which herbs are grown often figure into herb names. For example, (&quot;Radix glehniae&quot;) is grown and harvested in northern China, whereas (&quot;Radix adenophorae&quot;) originated in southern China. And the Chinese words for north and south are respectively and .

 (&quot;Bulbus fritillariae cirrhosae&quot;) and (&quot;Radix cyathulae&quot;) are both found in Sichuan province, as the character indicates in their names.

===Function===
Some herbs, like (&quot;Radix Saposhnikoviae&quot;), literally &#x27;prevent wind,&#x27; preventing or treating wind-related illnesses. (&quot;Radix Dipsaci&quot;), literally &#x27;restore the broken,&#x27; treating torn soft tissues and broken bones.

===Country of origin===
Many herbs indigenous to other countries have been incorporated into the Chinese materia medica. (&quot;Radix panacis quinquefolii&quot;), imported from North American crops, translates as &#x27;western ginseng,&#x27; while (&quot;Radix ginseng Japonica&quot;), grown in and imported from North Asian countries, is &#x27;eastern ginseng.&#x27;

==Toxicity==
From the earliest records regarding the use of medicinals to today, the toxicity of certain substances has been described in all Chinese materia medica. Since TCM has become more popular in the Western world, there are increasing concerns about the potential toxicity of many traditional Chinese medicinals including plants, animal parts and minerals. For most medicinals, efficacy and toxicity testing are based on traditional knowledge rather than laboratory analysis. The toxicity in some cases could be confirmed by modern research (i.e., in scorpion); in some cases it could not (i.e., in &quot;Curculigo&quot;). Further, ingredients may have different names in different locales or in historical texts, and different preparations may have similar names for the same reason, which can create inconsistencies and confusion in the creation of medicinals, with the possible danger of poisoning. Edzard Ernst &quot;concluded that adverse effects of herbal medicines are an important albeit neglected subject in dermatology, which deserves further systematic investigation.&quot; Research suggests that the toxic heavy metals and undeclared drugs found in Chinese herbal medicines might be a serious health issue.

Substances known to be potentially dangerous include aconite, secretions from the Asiatic toad, powdered centipede, the Chinese beetle (&quot;Mylabris phalerata&quot;, Ban mao), and certain fungi. There are health problems associated with &quot;Aristolochia&quot;. Toxic effects are also frequent with &quot;Aconitum&quot;. To avoid its toxic adverse effects &quot;Xanthium sibiricum&quot; must be processed. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with products containing &quot;Reynoutria multiflora&quot; (synonym &quot;Polygonum multiflorum&quot;), glycyrrhizin, &quot;Senecio&quot; and &quot;Symphytum&quot;. The evidence suggests that hepatotoxic herbs also include &quot;Dictamnus dasycarpus&quot;, &quot;Astragalus membranaceus&quot;, and &quot;Paeonia lactiflora&quot;; although there is no evidence that they cause liver damage. Contrary to popular belief, &quot;Ganoderma lucidum&quot; mushroom extract, as an adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy, appears to have the potential for toxicity.

Also, adulteration of some herbal medicine preparations with conventional drugs which may cause serious adverse effects, such as corticosteroids, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, and glibenclamide, has been reported.

However, many adverse reactions are due to misuse or abuse of Chinese medicine. For example, the misuse of the dietary supplement &quot;Ephedra&quot; (containing ephedrine) can lead to adverse events including gastrointestinal problems as well as sudden death from cardiomyopathy. Products adulterated with pharmaceuticals for weight loss or erectile dysfunction are one of the main concerns. Chinese herbal medicine has been a major cause of acute liver failure in China.

Most Chinese herbs are safe but some have shown not to be. Reports have shown products being contaminated with drugs, toxins, or false reporting of ingredients. Some herbs used in TCM may also react with drugs, have side effects, or be dangerous to people with certain medical conditions.

==Efficacy==

Only a few trials exist that are considered to have adequate methodology by scientific standards. Proof of effectiveness is poorly documented or absent. A 2016 Cochrane review found &quot;insufficient evidence that Chinese Herbal Medicines were any more or less effective than placebo or hormonal therapy&quot; for the relief of menopause related symptoms. A 2012 Cochrane review found no difference in decreased mortality for SARS patients when Chinese herbs were used alongside Western medicine versus Western medicine exclusively. A 2010 Cochrane review found there is not enough robust evidence to support the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine herbs to stop the bleeding from haemorrhoids. A 2008 Cochrane review found promising evidence for the use of Chinese herbal medicine in relieving painful menstruation, compared to conventional medicine such as NSAIDs and the oral contraceptive pill, but the findings are of low methodological quality. A 2012 Cochrane review found weak evidence suggesting that some Chinese medicinal herbs have a similar effect at preventing and treating influenza as antiviral medication. Due to the poor quality of these medical studies, there is insufficient evidence to support or dismiss the use of Chinese medicinal herbs for the treatment of influenza. There is a need for larger and higher quality randomized clinical trials to determine how effective Chinese herbal medicine is for treating people with influenza. A 2005 Cochrane review found that although the evidence was weak for the use of any single herb, there was low quality evidence that some Chinese medicinal herbs may be effective for the treatment of acute pancreatitis.

==Ecological impacts==

The traditional practice of using now-endangered species is controversial within TCM. Modern Materia Medicas such as Bensky, Clavey and Stoger&#x27;s comprehensive Chinese herbal text discuss substances derived from endangered species in an appendix, emphasizing alternatives.

Parts of endangered species used as TCM drugs include tiger bones and rhinoceros horn. Poachers supply the black market with such substances, and the black market in rhinoceros horn, for example, has reduced the world&#x27;s rhino population by more than 90 percent over the past 40 years. Concerns have also arisen over the use of turtle plastron and seahorses.

TCM recognizes bear bile as a medicinal. In 1988, the Chinese Ministry of Health started controlling bile production, which previously used bears killed before winter. Now bears are fitted with a sort of permanent catheter, which is more profitable than killing the bears. More than 12,000 asiatic black bears are held in &quot;bear farms&quot;, where they suffer cruel conditions while being held in tiny cages. The catheter leads through a permanent hole in the abdomen directly to the gall bladder, which can cause severe pain.
Increased international attention has mostly stopped the use of bile outside of China; gallbladders from butchered cattle () are recommended as a substitute for this ingredient.

Collecting American ginseng to assist the Asian traditional medicine trade has made ginseng the most harvested wild plant in North America for the last two centuries, which eventually led to a listing on CITES Appendix II.

Chinese medicinal plant materials (CMPMs) release chemicals that attracts the Drugstore beetle, leading to the accumulation of this pest and further infestation and damage to these plants.

==Herbs in use==
Chinese herbology is a pseudoscientific practice with potentially unreliable product quality, safety hazards or misleading health advice. There are regulatory bodies, such as China GMP (Good Manufacturing Process) of herbal products. There is a lack of high-quality scientific research on herbology practices and product effectiveness for anti-disease activity. In the herbal sources listed below, there is little or no evidence for efficacy or proof of safety across consumer age groups and disease conditions for which they are intended.

There are over 300 herbs in common use. Some of the most commonly used herbs are Ginseng (), wolfberry ( (&quot;Angelica sinensis&quot;, ), astragalus (), atractylodes (), bupleurum (), cinnamon (cinnamon twigs () and cinnamon bark ()), coptis (), ginger (), hoelen (), licorice (), &quot;ephedra sinica&quot; (), peony (white: and reddish: ), rehmannia (), rhubarb (), and salvia ().

==50 fundamental herbs==
In Chinese herbology, there are 50 &quot;fundamental&quot; herbs, as given in the reference text, although these herbs are not universally recognized as such in other texts. The herbs are:
==Other Chinese herbs==

In addition to the above, many other Chinese herbs and other substances are in common use, and these include:

* &quot;Akebia quinata&quot; ()
* &quot;Arisaema heterophyllum&quot; ()
* &quot;Chenpi&quot; (sun-dried tangerine (mandarin) peel) ()
* &quot;Clematis chinensis&quot; ()
* &quot;Concretio silicea bambusae&quot; ()
* &quot;Cordyceps sinensis&quot; ()
* &quot;Curcuma longa&quot;, &quot;Curcuma aromatica&quot; ()
* &quot;Dalbergia odorifera&quot; ()
* &quot;Myrrh&quot; ()
* &quot;Frankincense&quot; ()
* &quot;Prunus persica&quot; ()
* &quot;Patchouli&#x27; ()
* &quot;Polygonum&quot; ()
* &quot;Sparganium stoloniferum&quot; ()
* &quot;Zedoary&quot; (&quot;Curcuma zedoaria&quot;) ()
==Herbal Formulas==

===Types of Formulas===
Traditional Chinese herbs are used either standalone, or in a grouping, jointly with other herbs. When several herbs are used together, this amalgamation is called a &#x27;herbal formula&#x27;.

There are, generally speaking, three types of herbal formulas used in TCM:

1. Classic Formulas - these are formulas which TCM practitioners believe have withstood the test of time over the centuries, and are mentioned in classical texts, such as the Shanghan Lun.

2. Patent Formulas - these are either classic formulas, or newer commonly-used formulas created in recent decades. The patent formulas stand out in that their usage is common enough, that they are frequently mass-produced by large companies, in China, the United States, and elsewhere.

3. Custom-Made Formulas - these formulas are composed by a TCM Practitioner, to match the specific diagnosis and medical condition of a patient. These formulas are often partially-based on the older, classic formulas.

===Formula Hierarchy===
The prescription of TCM formulas, is based on 4-tier system of hierarchy. The 4-tiers are: Jun (君), Chen (臣), Zuo (佐) and Shi (使). These four tiers are often translated as: Sovereign, Minister, Assistant, Courier; or Monarch, Minister, Assistant, Envoy (also: &#x27;Guide&#x27;).

This feudal-like hierarchy denotes the power and role of each herb in a given formula. The Jun is the herb which is usually of the highest relative dosage, and leads the main action of the formula. In the majority of formulas, there is only one Jun (Monarch) herb. Sometimes, a formula may feature 2-3 Jun herbs, or lack a dominant Jun herb altogether. The Chen support the Jun in its actions, and provide additional uses for the medical purpose of the formula. The Zuo assist the Jun and Chen, but are given at a much lower dosage (relative to themselves), to deemphasize their influence, for various reasons. The Shi&#x27;s main role is to help guide the formula to the correct bodily areas or organ systems inside of which it is meant to act. The Shi are also sometimes used &quot;to harmonize the properties of other herbs in the formula&quot;.

Most herbs can serve as either Jun (Monarch), Chen (Minister) or Zuo (Assistant) - the first three tiers in the herbal hierarchy. But only certain herbs, are considered fit to serve as Shi. This is because only some herbs are believed to have the ability, to guide other herbs into a given bodily area or organ system.

===Matching and Contrasting Herbs===
Within TCM formulas, there are also strict rules about which herbs pair well together (Dui Yao), and which are either contradictory, incompatible, or may cause a reaction amongst themselves, or with Western Medicine Drugs. For example: Gan Cao (Licorice) is incompatible with the herbs Yuan hua, Jing Da Ji, Hai Zao and Gan Sui. It may also alter the therapeutic effects of corticosteroids.

<text>Buchan is a coastal district in the north-east of Scotland, bounded by the Ythan and Deveron rivers. It was one of the original provinces of the Kingdom of Alba. It is now one of the six committee areas of Aberdeenshire.

== Etymology ==
The genesis of the name &quot;Buchan&quot; is shrouded in uncertainty, but may be of Pictish origin. The name may involve an equivalent of Welsh &quot;buwch&quot; meaning &quot;a cow&quot;. American academic Thomas Clancy has noted cautiously the similarity between the territory names &quot;Buchan&quot; and &quot;Marr&quot; to those of the Welsh commotes &quot;Cantref Bychan&quot; and &quot;Cantref Mawr&quot;, meaning &quot;small commote&quot; and &quot;large commote&quot;, respectively.

==History==

The first documentary record of Buchan is a reference in the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; to the death of King Indulf at the hands of Vikings in Buchan in 962, a death separately recorded in a 12th-century king list as taking place at Cullen. Cullen is to the west of the River Deveron, in an area where the Earls of Buchan held land as late as the 13th century, suggesting that Buchan&#x27;s boundaries at this time extended as far west as the River Spey.

In Pictish times, Buchan was located within the kingdom of Cé. There is considerable ancient history in this geographic area, especially slightly north-west of Cruden Bay, where the Catto Long Barrow and numerous tumuli are found.

At one time, the district of Buchan comprised all the land between the Don and Deveron, but now the land between the Don and the Ythan is known as Formartine, so &quot;Buchan&quot; has taken on a restricted sense.

== Features ==

The Buchan area has a population of 39,160 (2001 census) and an area of . It contains the town of Peterhead and is adjacent to the committee and administrative areas of Banff and Buchan and Formartine.

Peterhead is the largest town in Buchan and Aberdeenshire; the principal whitefish-landing port in Europe; and a major oil industry service centre. Equally important is the nearby gas terminal at St Fergus. Remote Radar Head Buchan, an RAF air-defence radar unit, is located near Peterhead.

Attempts are being made to counter the negative effects of several recent key company closures and economic threats. Inland, the area is dependent upon agriculture, and many villages have seen a decline in population and services. Issues affecting Banff and Buchan also apply here, as does the future of the oil and gas industry. Part of Buchan benefits from EU aid coverage. Opportunities exist through the Buchan Local Action Plan to safeguard and enhance the economic future of Peterhead and Buchan.

The Formartine and Buchan Way runs through Buchan.

<doc id="415074" wikidata="Q1635070" url="?curid=415074" title="Thomas and the Magic Railroad">
<text>Thomas and the Magic Railroad is a 2000 children&#x27;s fantasy adventure film written and directed by Britt Allcroft and produced by Allcroft and Phil Fehrle; the cast includes Alec Baldwin, Peter Fonda, Mara Wilson, Didi Conn, Russell Means, Cody McMains, Michael E. Rodgers, and the voices of Eddie Glen and Neil Crone. The film is based on the British children&#x27;s book series &quot;The Railway Series&quot; by the Reverend W. Awdry, its televised adaptation &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; by Allcroft, and the American television series &quot;Shining Time Station&quot; by Allcroft and Rick Siggelkow; it is the only theatrical live-action/animated film in the &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; franchise. The plot is centered on Lily Stone (Wilson), the granddaughter of the caretaker (Fonda) of an enchanted steam engine who is lacking an appropriate supply of coal, and Mr. Conductor (Baldwin) of Shining Time Station, whose provisions of magical gold dust are at a critical low. Lily and Mr. Conductor enlist the help of Thomas the Tank Engine (Glen), who confronts the ruthless, steam engine-hating Diesel 10 (Crone) along the way.

&quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot; premiered on July 9, 2000. It was panned by critics upon release, with criticism of the acting, plot, special effects, and lack of fidelity to its source material. The film was a box office bomb, grossing $19.7 million worldwide against a production budget of $19 million; Allcroft resigned from her company in September 2000 due to the film&#x27;s poor performance. HiT Entertainment acquired the company two years later, including the television rights to &quot;Thomas&quot;. As of October 2020, a second theatrical live-action animated &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; film is in development at Mattel Films, a division of Mattel, the current owner of HiT Entertainment, with Marc Forster serving as director.

==Plot==

Sir Topham Hatt and his family have left the Island of Sodor on holiday, leaving Mr. Conductor in charge. When Gordon complains that Thomas was eight seconds late, Diesel 10 races by and scares both engines. In Shining Time, Mr. Conductor is suffering a crisis; his supply of magic gold dust is too low for him to travel back from Sodor. At Tidmouth Sheds, Diesel 10 announces his plan to rid Sodor of steam engines by destroying Lady, the lost engine. Lady had been hidden in a workshop on Muffle Mountain by her driver, Burnett Stone, after Diesel 10&#x27;s previous attempt to destroy her. Lady is unable to steam despite trying all of the coals in Indian Valley. The steam engines agree to find Lady before Diesel 10, unaware that Diesel 10&#x27;s sidekicks, Splatter and Dodge, are spying on them. That night, Diesel 10 approaches the shed where the steam engines are sleeping and destroys the side of it with his claw. Mr. Conductor scares Diesel 10 away by threatening to pour a bag of sugar into his fuel tanks.

The following day, Mr. Conductor calls his cousin, Mr. C. Junior, to help him with the gold dust crisis. That night, Percy and Thomas conclude there is a secret railway between Sodor and Shining Time. Diesel 10 tells Splatter and Dodge of his plans to destroy Lady. Toby overhears and distracts Diesel 10, who knocks one of the shed supports with his claw, which collapses the roof on top of them. The next morning, Thomas is collecting coal trucks when one of them rolls through the buffers that lead to the secret railway. Mr. Conductor is abducted by Diesel 10, who threatens to drop him off a viaduct unless he divulges the location of the buffers. Mr. Conductor cuts one of the claw&#x27;s hydraulic hoses and is thrown free. He lands at the Sodor windmill, where he finds a clue to the source of the gold dust.

Burnett&#x27;s granddaughter Lily meets Patch, who takes her to Shining Time, where she meets Junior. Junior takes her through the Magic Railroad to Sodor, where they meet Thomas. Thomas is not happy to see Junior, but agrees to help and takes them to the windmill, where they find Mr. Conductor. Percy discovers that Splatter and Dodge have found the Sodor entrance to the Magic Railroad and goes to warn Thomas. While traveling through the Magic Railroad to take Lily home, Thomas discovers the missing coal truck. Lily goes to find Burnett, leaving Thomas stranded. Thomas rolls down the mountain and re-enters the Magic Railroad through another secret portal.

Burnett explains to Lily the problem of getting Lady to steam. Lily suggests using a special coal from Sodor, and Burnett uses it to start Lady. Lady takes them along the Magic Railroad and, followed by Thomas, returns to Sodor. Diesel 10 arrives with Splatter and Dodge, who decide to stop helping him. Diesel 10 then chases Thomas and Lady and tries to cross the viaduct, but it collapses under his weight and he falls into a barge filled with sludge.

Lily combines water from a wishing well and shavings from the Magic Railroad to make more gold dust. Mr. Conductor gives Junior his conductor&#x27;s hat before they depart. Lily, Burnett, Patch, and Mutt return to Shining Time, and Lady returns to the Magic Railroad while Thomas travels home into the sunset.

==Production==
===Development===
In the early 1990s, the character of Thomas the Tank Engine (adapted from the Rev. W. Awdry&#x27;s &quot;The Railway Series&quot; into the TV series, &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends&quot;, created by Britt Allcroft) was at the height of his popularity following three successful series. At the same time, &quot;Shining Time Station&quot; (an American series that combined episodes from the previous series with original live-action characters and scenarios, also created by Allcroft along with Rick Siggelkow) was made, and also successful. As early as 1994, prior to the launch of &quot;Thomas&quot;″s fourth series, Britt Allcroft had plans to make a feature film based on both of these series, and would make use of the model trains from &quot;Thomas&quot; and the live-action aesthetic of &quot;Shining Time Station&quot;.

In mid to late 1995, Britt Allcroft was approached by Barry London, then vice-chairman of Paramount Pictures, with an idea for the &quot;Thomas&quot; film. In February 1996, Britt signed a contract to write the script for the film with the working title &quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot;. London&#x27;s interest is thought to have stemmed from his three-year-old daughter, who was enthralled by &quot;Thomas&quot;. According to a press release, filming was to take place at Shepperton Studios, in the United Kingdom and the United States, with the theatrical release date set for 1997. However, later that year, after London left the company, Paramount shelved the plans for the film. This left Allcroft to seek other sources of funding. Discussions with PolyGram about the film were held, but not for long, because of the company being in the middle of a corporate restructuring and sale.

In the Summer of 1998, during series 5 of &quot;Thomas&quot;″s production, Allcroft saw an Isle of Man Film Commission advert. They were offering tax incentives to companies wanting to film on the island. Allcroft visited and felt that the location was perfect. During that year, Barry London became chairman of the newly founded Destination Films (owned by Sony Pictures). He renewed his interest in the project, and Destination Films became the main financial backer and studio for the film.

===Distribution===
In addition to being a major studio and financial backer, Destination announced in February 1999 that they would distribute the film in the United States while handling a possible sales exchange in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Gullane Pictures would handle international sales rights in all other territories. In June 1999, Icon Film Distribution acquired the British distribution rights to the film from Destination.

===Casting===
In early August 1999, it was announced that Alec Baldwin, Mara Wilson and Peter Fonda had joined the cast to play Mr. Conductor, Lily Stone and Burnett Stone respectively. David Jacobs, the former vice president of The Britt Allcroft Company, stated that Baldwin got involved in the project because his daughter Ireland was a fan of the series. John Bellis was originally attached to voice Thomas, but was replaced by Canadian actor Edward Glen. Ewan McGregor and Bob Hoskins had also expressed interest for the role. Michael Angelis, the UK narrator for the &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; television series at the time, was originally cast to voice both James and Percy, but was later replaced by voice actresses Susan Roman and Linda Ballantyne. Keith Scott was originally set to voice Diesel 10, but was later replaced by Neil Crone in the final film. Patrick Breen (known as the narrator of Allcroft&#x27;s &quot;Magic Adventures of Mumfie&quot;) was originally set to voice both Splatter and Dodge, but was eventually replaced by both Kevin Frank and Neil Crone.

===Filming===
Principal photography began on August 2, 1999, and wrapped on October 15, 1999. The movie was filmed at the Strasburg Rail Road in Strasburg, Pennsylvania (United States), as well as in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and on the Isle of Man. Castletown railway station on the Isle of Man Railway formed part of Shining Time Station and the goods shed at Port St Mary railway station became Burnett Stone&#x27;s workshop. Running shots of the &quot;Indian Valley&quot; train were filmed at the Strasburg Rail Road location. The large passenger station where Lily boards the train is the Harrisburg Transportation Center. Norfolk &amp; Western 4-8-0 475 was repainted as the Indian Valley locomotive. Sodor was realised using models and chroma key. The models were animated using live action remote control, as on the television series. The model sequences were filmed in Toronto instead of Shepperton Studios, the &quot;home&quot; of the original TV show; however, several of the show&#x27;s key staff were flown over to participate. The Magic Railway was created using models, CGI, and water-coloured matte paintings.

===Post-production===
In a 2007 interview with Sodor Island Forums &amp; Fansite, Allcroft revealed that before the film&#x27;s theatrical release, she and editor Ron Wisman were requested to substantially rework the film from how she had originally envisioned it by removing Burnett&#x27;s rival P.T. Boomer (played by Doug Lennox), who was the original antagonist and character originally responsible for wrecking Lady, because the test audiences at the March 2000 preview screenings in Los Angeles considered Boomer to be &quot;too scary&quot; for young children. Despite most of his scenes being removed, Boomer can still be seen briefly in one scene, however the scene was redubbed with Boomer as a lost motorcyclist talking to Burnett for directions, as in the original cut, Boomer and Burnett were having a row.

Lily Stone (played by Mara Wilson) was intended to be the narrator of the story. Before filming, Thomas&#x27;s voice was provided by John Bellis, a British fireman and part-time taxi driver who worked on the film as the Isle of Man transportation co-ordinator and facilities manager. Bellis received the role when he happened to pick up Britt Allcroft and her crew from the Isle of Man Airport in July 1999. According to Allcroft, after hearing him speak for the first time, she told her colleagues, &quot;I have just heard the voice of Thomas. That man is exactly how Thomas would sound!&quot; A few days later, she offered the role to Bellis, and he accepted. However, the test audiences felt that to his voice sounded &quot;too old&quot; for Thomas, although Bellis did receive onscreen credit as the Transportation Co-Ordinator, and a few of his lines remain intact in both the teaser trailer and the original UK trailer.

Crushed and angered by the changes, Bellis said he was &quot;gutted&quot;, but still wished the filmmakers well. In an April 2000 interview, following the changes, he said, &quot;It was supposed to be my big break, but it hasn&#x27;t put me off and I am hoping something else will come along.&quot; English actor Michael Angelis, who was the UK narrator of the series at the time, was the original voice of both James and Percy, but was recast for the same reason as Bellis. Australian voice actor Keith Scott originally voiced Diesel 10 (as evidenced in both the US and UK trailers), but he believes that he was recast because test audiences claimed that his portrayal was &quot;too scary&quot; for young children. Additionally, American actor Patrick Breen was the original voice of both Splatter and Dodge, but he was also subsequently recast for unknown reasons.

===Music and soundtrack===

&quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot; is a soundtrack released on both CD and cassette on August 1, 2000. It features twelve music tracks from the feature film composed by Hummie Mann. Unlike the film, the soundtrack received more favorable reception.

==Release==
=== Theatrical ===
&quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot; was released theatrically on July 14, 2000, in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and on July 26, 2000, in the United States and Canada. The film was also released in Australia on December 14, 2000, and in New Zealand on April 7, 2001. Before that, the film premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square; for the purpose, a steam locomotive, no. 47298 painted to resemble Thomas, was brought to the cinema by low loader on July 9, 2000. National press coverage was low, as many journalists were concentrating on the launch of the book, &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, for which a special train called &quot;Hogwarts Express&quot; would run from July 8 to 11. In September 2020, it was announced that the film would be re-released in theaters on October 24, 2020, for the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary with all the uncut and deleted scenes restored.

===Home media===
====United Kingdom====
&quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot; was originally released onto VHS and DVD by Icon Home Entertainment on October 19, 2000. The film was re-released on DVD in July 2007, this time self-distributed by Icon themselves.

====United States====
The film was released onto VHS and DVD by Columbia TriStar Home Video on October 31, 2000. The only special features on the DVD release are a deleted scene and the theatrical trailer. In 2007, the film was released as part of a double feature with &quot;The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland&quot;. It was also released as part of a triple feature with &quot;The Adventures of Milo and Otis&quot; and &quot;The Bear&quot;.

A re-release of the film on DVD and Blu-ray as a 20th anniversary edition from Shout! Factory and under license by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment was released on September 29, 2020. The 20th anniversary edition includes a two-part documentary of the film, new interviews with the cast and crew, and a rough cut version of the film including extended and deleted scenes as well as the storyline of P.T. Boomer.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened on 314 screens in the United Kingdom on 14 July 2000 and grossed £431,286 in its opening weekend, ranking fifth at the UK box office.

It grossed $19.7 million worldwide against a production budget of $19 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 21% based on 68 reviews, along with an average rating of 3.97/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Kids these days demand cutting edge special effects or at least a clever plot with cute characters. This movie has neither, having lost in its Americanization what the British original did so right.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 19 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film one star out of four, and wrote &quot;(the fact) That &quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot; made it into theaters at all is something of a mystery. This is a production with &#x27;straight to video&#x27; written all over it. Kids who like the Thomas books might kinda like it. Especially younger kids. Real younger kids. Otherwise, no.&quot; While he admired the models and art direction, he criticized how the engines&#x27; mouths did not move when they spoke, the overly depressed performance of Peter Fonda, as well as the overall lack of consistency in the plot. Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a negative review, saying, &quot;Mr. Baldwin&#x27;s attack – there&#x27;s no better way to put it – is unforgettable.&quot;

William Thomas of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film a one out of five stars, he was critical of the films special effects, stating that &quot;believe it or not, the true villains of the piece are, in fact, the &#x27;special&#x27; effects. Quite how – in today&#x27;s era of slo-mo and seamless digital wizardry – such a shoddy result can have been achieved is anyone&#x27;s guess. With clunky bluescreen, spot-a-mile-off matte work and an absolute lack of synergy between real-life and animated action, it all conspires to provide an appropriately amateur sheen.&quot; &quot;Plugged In&quot; stated, &quot;While the animation maintains its simple appearance, the plot is anything &quot;but&quot; simple. And that&#x27;s not good news for the many tots who make up the majority of &quot;Thomas&quot;″ audience. Switching back and forth between Shining Time and Sodor, interweaving two relatively complex story lines, may confuse more than it challenges. Parents may well find that their children are squirming in their seats long before Thomas rides his magic rails into the sunset. That said, and the magic notwithstanding, tikes who do manage to grasp the complex story lines, and can sit still for an hour and a half, will learn good lessons about friendship, courage, hard work and being kind.&quot; Nell Minow of Common Sense Media gave the film three out of five stars and writing that it &quot;will please [Thomas fans]&quot; but that the plot &quot;might confuse kids&quot;.

===Accolades===
==In other media==
===Video game===
A video game based on the film, titled &quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad: Print Studio&quot;, was released in the United Kingdom. Published by Hasbro Interactive, it was released for Microsoft Windows personal computers on August 25, 2000.

==Legacy==
===Cancelled sequel and live-action adaptation===
On July 1, 2000, it was reported that Destination Films began development on a sequel, but it was quietly cancelled.

In 2009, HiT announced a live-action adaptation film of &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; would pilot its theatrical division, tentatively named &quot;The Adventures of Thomas&quot;. It was originally targeted for a late 2010 release, but this was revised to Spring 2011. By January 2011, the release date had been pushed back further to 2012. The initial draft of the script was written by Josh Klausner, who has also said that the film would be set around the times of World War II; Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi also helped write the script. On June 8, 2011, it was announced that &quot;9&quot; director Shane Acker would direct the film, with Weta Digital designing the visual effects. No updates on the film were made after HiT was bought by Mattel in 2012, cancelling the project.

===Upcoming live action animated film===
On October 6, 2020, it was announced that Marc Forster would be directing a new theatrical live-action animated film based on &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;.

<text>The Chester Canal was an English canal linking the south Cheshire town of Nantwich with the River Dee at Chester. It was intended to link Chester to Middlewich, with a branch to Nantwich, but the Trent and Mersey Canal were unco-operative about a junction at Middlewich, and so the route to Nantwich was opened in 1779. There were also difficulties negotiating with the River Dee Company, and with no possibility of through traffic, the canal was uneconomic. Part of it was closed in 1787, when Beeston staircase locks collapsed, and there was no money to fund repairs. When the Ellesmere Canal was proposed in 1790, the company saw it as a ray of hope, and somehow managed to keep the struggling canal open. The Ellesmere Canal provided a link to the River Mersey at Ellesmere Port from 1797, and the fortunes of the Chester Canal began to improve.

The Ellesmere Canal was also building branches in North Wales, which were intended to link up to the River Dee at Chester, but eventually linked to the Chester Canal at Hurleston Junction, just to the north of Nantwich, in 1805. The canal then became the middle section of a much longer and more profitable canal. The two companies merged in 1813, becoming the Ellesmere and Chester Canal. When the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal was proposed in 1826, which would provide a link from Nantwich to Wolverhampton and the Birmingham canal system, the company saw it as an opportunity to build the Middlewich Branch, which would provide a connection to Manchester and the Potteries. The branch opened in 1833, and the Junction Canal opened in 1835. Amalgamation followed in 1845, with the new company retaining the name of the Ellesmere and Chester Canal. The following year, the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company was formed from the Ellesmere and Chester company, which also took over a number of canals which joined theirs. Plans to convert some of the canals to railways were put on hold in 1847, when the canal company was leased to the London and North Western Railway. Under railway control, the canals continued to operate successfully, but decline set in during the 20th century, and when many of the adjoining canals were closed in 1944, the sections which had been the Ellesmere and Chester Canal and the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, together with the Middlewich Branch, were retained.

The canals were nationalised in 1948, and long-distance commercial traffic had all but ended by 1958. In 1963, the British Waterways Board was formed and the canal ceased to be operated by railway interests for the first time in over 100 years. It was designated as a cruising waterway in the Transport Act 1968, with potential for leisure use, and since then, it has been enjoyed by recreational boaters, by walkers and by fishermen. In 1997, the Chester Canal Heritage Trust was formed and has worked to promote the canal and its heritage. Responsibility for the canal passed from British Waterways to the newly formed Canal &amp; River Trust in 2012.

==History==
In 1771, the people of Chester, fearing that the construction of the Trent and Mersey Canal would divert trade away from their city to Liverpool, announced in the Press that they would be applying to build a canal between Middlewich, on the Trent and Mersey, and Chester. The city was at the time served by the River Dee, and the River Dee Company had recently spent £80,000 on improvements to the river, but they realised that without a connection to the growing canal network, there was little future for the river or the Port of Chester. The idea had first been raised three years earlier, when merchants suggested a line from the Trent and Mersey to near Runcorn. There were no objections from the Corporation of Liverpool, but the canal company was non-committal. By 1770, the plans were a little clearer, with a main line from Chester to Middlewich and a branch to Nantwich. Although the Corporation of Chester subscribed £100 towards the scheme, and the societies and clubs of Chester put up another £2,000, there was little enthusiasm for it. Neither the Weaver Navigation nor the Trent and Mersey were supportive, as both might have lost some trade if the canal were built, and when the Duke of Bridgewater was approached for support, he replied that provided the canal did not physically link with the Trent and Mersey at Middlewich, he would not oppose the plans. Despite attempts at flattery, the Duke would not alter his position, and so the company promoting the bill in Parliament began with a serious disadvantage.
The bill became an act of Parliament, (12 Geo. 3. c. 75), on 1 April 1772, authorising the construction of a canal to run &quot;from the River Dee, within the liberties of the city of Chester, to or near Middlewich and Nantwich&quot;. The act allowed the company to raise £42,000 by issuing £100 shares, and an additional £20,000 if necessary. Of this, only £28,000 had been subscribed at the time of the act, but construction began near Chester, with Samual Weston acting as engineer and John Lawton working as his assistant. Weston had previously worked as a surveyor, and had been involved in excavating canals as a contractor, but had no experience of managing a major engineering project. The Mayor of Chester cut the first sod at the end of April. There were concerns that while the canal was being constructed past Northgate Gardens, prisoners from Northgate Prison might escape, and the company had to give a bond against this possibility. The canal was conceived as a broad canal, designed with locks which were by suitable for broad-beam barges. Most of the Trent and Mersey Canal north of the proposed junction was suitable for barges which were wide, but the final three locks in Middlewich, and all of those south of the junction, are only suitable for narrow-beam barges.

The project was hampered by financial and engineering problems, and so progress was slow. At the Chester end, the River Dee Company had managed to insert a clause into the act of Parliament which restricted the width of the final lock into the river to . Although the lock was built, and some narrow boats capable of using it were constructed, agreement was reached on a wider connection after four years of argument. The solution adopted was a single pair of gates, which provided a entrance into a basin from which the canal rose to the Northgate level. The land on which the basin was built was owned by the River Dee Company, who therefore charged tolls on all traffic using it. In 1774, part of an aqueduct collapsed, and had to be dismantled and repaired.

Soon afterwards, Weston left the project, and Thomas Morris was recalled from Ireland to take over. He had previous experience building the extension of the Bridgewater Canal to Runcorn. Under his direction, the canal opened from Chester to Huxley Aqueduct on 16 January 1775, and to Beeston in June. Morris was sacked in September, to be replaced by Josiah Clowes. He too was sacked, and was followed by Moon, who had previously acted as assistant to Morris. The canal was completed under the direction of Joseph Taylor. In September 1776, the junction with the Dee was opened, but the project was now in financial difficulties. By late 1777, they had spent all of the share capital of £42,000 and another £19,000, which had been raised as a loan guaranteed by Samuel Egerton of Tatton. He was a shareholder in the company and related to the Duke of Bridgewater. They applied for another act of Parliament, the (17 Geo. 3. c. 67), which allowed them to raise another £25,000, by additional calls on existing shareholders, and to borrow £30,000 as a mortgage. They succeeded in raising £6,000 by making additional calls, and borrowed £4,000 from Richard Reynolds, an ironmaster from Ketley, who was responsible for several of the East Shropshire Canals, including the Wombridge Canal and the Ketley Canal.

The money was used to complete the line to Nantwich, and to build a reservoir at Bunbury Heath. The work was completed in August 1779, and the company hoped to raise enough money to then build the line to Middlewich. They proposed building it with narrow locks, to reduce the cost, but the shareholders were not prepared to support them; instead they concentrated on trying to generate traffic on the line that had been built. They attempted to mine salt at Nantwich, but failed to find any, and tried running boats on the Trent and Mersey, from which goods were carried over land to Nantwich, for onward carriage to Liverpool. They also ran boats for cargo and passengers on the canal itself. By the end of 1781, the company had no money and was unable to meet interest payments on the loans. They decided to forfeit the canal to Egerton, the main mortgagee, but he did not respond to their offer. Angry landowners who had not been paid drained Bunbury reservoir in March 1782, but somehow the committee managed to keep the canal open, by selling boats and land. Disaster struck in November 1787, when Beeston Staircase Locks collapsed, and there was no money to fund repairs.

===The impact of the Ellesmere Canal===

In 1790 the plans for the Ellesmere Canal were published, and the directors of the Chester canal saw this as a chance to make the canal profitable again, and to build the Middlewich branch. Following the chairman&#x27;s report to a meeting of the shareholders, they resolved to try to raise some money to carry out repairs, any by the end of the year reported that the canal was &quot;nearly filled with water and business begins to stir.&quot; The Ellesmere scheme was extensive, with a line from the River Mersey at Netherpool (later renamed Ellesmere Port) to the River Dee near Chester, to give access to the Chester Canal, and branches to Shrewsbury, Ruabon, Llangollen, Bersham, Llanymynech and maybe Whitchurch and Wem. Although William Jessop estimated that the cost would be £196,898, it was the time of the Canal Mania, and 1,234 subscribers offered £967,700. Applications were scaled down and the company accepted £246,500. A rival group were proposing canals to the east, which resulted in the first group proposing a direct link with the Chester Canal from their Whitchurch Branch, and in February 1793, the two groups amalgamated. On 30 April they obtained an act of Parliament (33 Geo. 3. c. 91) authorising them to raise £400,00 with an additional £100,000 if necessary. Jessop was assisted by John Duncombe, Thomas Denson and William Turner, and from 30 October, Thomas Telford was appointed to set out the line and oversee the construction.

Work began on the Wirral line from Ellesmere Port to Chester in November 1793, and packet boats began using most of it on 1 July 1795. The locks connecting it to the River Mersey were completed early the following year, and the connection to the Chester Canal opened in January 1797. The line was supplied with water from the Chester Canal, supplemented by a steam engine at Ellesmere Port which pumped water from the Mersey. Passenger boats along the canal proved very popular, with connections from Ellesmere Port to Liverpool provided by larger boats, although passenger services from Chester to Nantwich lasted for less than a year. Commercial traffic also grew steadily, helped by the construction of new basins at Chester and the provision of a tide lock into the Dee, which made access into the lower basin possible at all times, and helped to keep it free from silt.

The Ellesmere Canal company had been constructing canals to the west, linking Llangollen to Frankton, but the route from there to Chester had not been decided. In 1796, they obtained an act of Parliament (36 Geo. 3. c. 71), authorising a line from near the great aqueduct at Pontcysyllte running roughly northwards through Ruabon, Bersham, Gwersyllt and Pulford to join the River Dee opposite the canal basin at Chester. The Chester company, who were trying to put their financial affairs into order, noticed that the 1796 act failed to mention a connection with their canal. They decided to obtain an act of Parliament to enforce a connection, and to stop supplying water to the Wirral line. The Ellesmere company responded quickly, agreeing to make changes to their act of Parliament, and the Chester company continued to supply water. On the strength of this, they were also able to raise some money to put the canal into good order and to repay some of their debts. The Ellesmere company extended their canal eastwards from Frankton to Whitchurch, and in 1802, the two companies reached agreement on a line from near Whitchurch to Hurleston Junction, just to the north of Nantwich. It opened on 25 March 1805, and water supply was enhanced by the construction of a navigable feeder through Llangollen to Horseshoe Falls on the River Dee at Llantisilio.
In 1804, the Ellesmere company offered to buy out the Chester Canal for 1,000 of their shares, and to take over debts up to £4,000. The Chester Canal held out for more, and the negotiations failed. Three years later, the financial position of the Chester Canal was better, and they began paying off their debts. Finally in 1813, they agreed to amalgamate, and the action was authorised by a further act of Parliament, the (53 Geo. 3. c. lxxx). The Ellesmere company paid just half of their 1804 offer, and the 500 Ellesmere shares were distributed between the various Chester shareholders. The Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company took over on 1 July 1813. A new section of canal and an iron lock were built at Beeston in 1827, to resolve continual problems with leakage there.

===A new route to the south===
In 1826, the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal was authorised by an act of Parliament, to construct a canal from Nantwich to a junction with the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal at Autherley in the Midlands. With the prospect of being part of a link between Liverpool and the Midlands, the joint company had again pressed for the construction of the Middlewich branch, which would give them an outlet to Manchester and the Potteries industrial centre around Stoke-on-Trent. The Trent and Mersey Canal refused to sanction the idea of a canal which would effectively reduce their income until the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal was authorised. Once it was, the Ellesmere and Chester company obtained an act of Parliament in 1827, but the Trent and Mersey insisted that they build a short connecting canal, the Wardle Canal, consisting of a lock and not much more, the tolls for which were exorbitant. The 1827 act repealed all previous legislation for the Ellesmere and Chester Canals and consolidated their position. The branch was built as a narrow canal, and cost £129,000. It opened on 1 September 1833, but was little used until the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal was completed. It finally opened on 2 March 1835, having suffered from engineering problems during construction. Again, it was a narrow canal, suitable for boats which were wide.

The two canal companies worked together from the start, in a bid to ensure that both remained profitable despite competition from the railways. This came soon, for the Grand Junction Railway from Warrington to Birmingham had been authorised before the canal opened, and was carrying goods by January 1838. Tolls on the canals were considerably lower than had been envisaged when the route was promoted. Experiments with steam tugs to haul trains of narrow boats were carried out in 1842, and a report in 1844 indicated that they were then used extensively. By the following year, however, the Ellesmere and Chester company were thinking about converting the canal to a railway, and argued that steam tugs were no cheaper than locomotive haulage on a railway. A merger with the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal was discussed in 1844, and was authorised by the Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company Act 1845 (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. ii) on 8 May 1845, the new company retaining the name of the Ellesmere and Chester Canal.

===Part of the Shropshire Union===
Almost immediately, the company began looking at the possibility of converting all or part of the system into railways. W. A. Povis, their engineer, was convinced that railways could be built along the routes at around half the cost of building a new line. The move was opposed by the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal who argued that closing bits of the inland waterways system would have serious repercussions on the parts left. Robert Stephenson suggested that a number of railways and canals should amalgamate, to reduce competition when bills were presented to Parliament. The canals to join the Ellesmere and Chester Company were the eastern and western branches of the Montgomeryshire Canal, the Shrewsbury Canal and the Shropshire Canal. Although some would be converted to railways, the route from Ellesmere Port to Middlewich via Barbridge Junction was part of the system that would be retained as a waterway, on which salt was a major source of revenue. The plans resulted in the formation of the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company in 1846. The new company could raise £3.3 million of new capital, in addition to that already in existence, with another £1.1 million if necessary. They prompted new railways, but before any of the existing canals were converted, the company was leased to the London and North Western Railway, who took control in June 1847. They allowed the Shropshire Union to continue to operate fairly independently, and by 1849, the idea of conversion had been dropped, as the canals could still operate profitably.

Profitability was maintained, with the result then when most of the Shropshire Union network of canals were abandoned in 1944, the sections which had originally been the Chester Canal, the northern part of the Ellesmere Canal, the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal and the Middlewich Branch were all retained. The only other section which was not abandoned was the Llangollen branch; this was kept because of its function as a water supply channel, rather than for navigation.

==Leisure era==
In common with many operational canals, the remains of the Shropshire Union system, including what had been the Chester Canal, were nationalised on 1 January 1948, and became the responsibility of the Docks and Inland Waterways Executive, which was part of the British Transport Commission. At the time, the function of canals was still viewed as commercial. An official reply to the Inland Waterways Association in 1947 stated that the Ministry of Transport &quot;... do not look very favourably upon any scheme for pleasure craft on the canals at the present time.&quot; Despite such official attitudes, Eric Wilson, who produced the first edition of &quot;Inland Waterways of Great Britain&quot; in 1939, noted that those wishing to use the Shropshire Union for leisure cruising should apply to the Agent at Chester. He advised that application should be made well in advance, in case there were problems due to the condition of the waterway and its locks.

Control of the canal passed to the British Waterways Board on 1 January 1963, and for the first time in over 100 years, it was managed by an organisation which was not under railway control. The Transport Act 1968 classified all waterways under the jurisdiction of British Waterways into commercial, cruising and remainder waterways. All of the remaining Shropshire Union network was designated as cruising waterway, with the potential for leisure use. By that time there was little commercial traffic. The branch to the River Dee at Chester had been unused since 1932–34, with the demise of steel traffic from Shotton steelworks to Ellesmere Port, and long distance carrying of tar from Ellesmere Port to the Midlands had ended in 1957–58.

The canal is popular with pleasure boaters, as much of it is pleasantly rural, with added interest provided by the city of Chester and Ellesmere Port with its waterways museum. The towpath through Chester provides an attractive route for walkers. The canal is well connected, with links to the Trent and Mersey Canal via the Middlewich Branch to the east, the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal via the former Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal to the south, and provides a route to the Llangollen Canal, from which the Montgomeryshire Canal, which is the subject of an ongoing restoration scheme, can be accessed. Boaters can also access the River Dee at Chester, although advance notice must be given, and the river is only accessible for four hours either side of high tide. At Ellesmere Port, the canal has connected to the Manchester Ship Canal since its opening in 1894. For many leisure cruisers, the requirements of the ship canal company for taking small boats onto a large commercial waterway are too daunting, and Ellesmere Port acts as the end of their journey.

The Chester Canal Heritage Trust was set up in 1997 to promote the canal and its heritage. Among other projects, they have received funding from the Local History Initiative and the Nationwide Building Society, which has allowed them to research the history of the canal and publish the results as a book. In 2012, responsibility for the canal passed from British Waterways to the newly formed Canal &amp; River Trust.

==Traffic==
Although the Chester Canal was not a success as traffic was sparse, this changed once it was connected to the Ellesmere Canal. The Ellesmere company expected to carry limestone from the quarries at Llanymynech and Trevor, iron from the ironworks at Ruabon and Bersham, and coal from mines at Chirk, Ruabon and Wrexham to Chester, Liverpool and Shrewsbury. The canal to Bersham and Wrexham was not built, and that to Shrewsbury was built much later on, but trade in coal, limestone, lime and building materials developed within the network of canals, and traffic between the canals and Liverpool increased steadily, much of it passing along the former Chester Canal. Receipts for the Ellesmere Canal were £12,568 in 1807 and £15,707 just two years later.

In 1836, a review of trade on the canals showed that limestone from Llanymynech and coal from Chirk was used to produce lime at a number of locations along the canals. Coal from Chirk for industrial and household use was carried, although there was a competing trade in coal from Flintshire, which travelled along the River Dee and entered the canal system at Chester. There was trade in iron from Ruabon to Chester, but the tolls were very low, as the canal route was long, whereas the land journey was only . In 1838, the canals carried 60,406 tons of iron bound for Liverpool, most of it manufactured goods, of which 38,758 tons came from Staffordshire, 11,687 tons from North Wales and 9,961 tons from Shropshire. An additional 10,370 tons, most of which originated in North Wales, passed along the Middlewich Branch, bound for Manchester.

The canal company carried goods in their own boats, and produced a report on the four years from August 1846 to June 1850 in 1851. This showed an income of £180,746 from tolls, and identified six main types of traffic. These included iron goods from the Wolverhampton area to Liverpool; limestone from Trevor and Crickheath to Nantwich or Wappenshall on the Shrewsbury Canal, with a back trade in iron ore from near Burslem; general merchandise, which was carried between Chester and Liverpool; and general merchandise for Shropshire and North Wales. All of these were profitable. The carriage of general goods from Birmingham to Liverpool and the Chester coal trade both made a small loss.

Once the canals were owned by the London and North Western Railway, restrictions were imposed on what they could carry, and the canals failed to make sufficient money to cover the interest on mortgages. However, they made a substantial operating profit for some years. Around 1850, the average annual income was £104,638, which yielded a surplus of £45,885. Most of the income was from carrying, and by 1870, income had risen to £143,976, although this only yielded a surplus of £11,727. Total traffic was 855,462 tons in 1858, but this had dropped to 742,315 tons in 1868. The carrying business was expanded in the 1870s, but although turnover increased, operating profits fell dramatically, to just £1,568 in 1876. By 1905, total traffic was 469,950 tons, nearly all of it in boats owned by the company, and between the 1870s and the onset of World War I the company sometimes made a small operating profit and sometimes a loss. Following the end of the war, working hours were cut, wages increased, and the cost of materials increased. Losses escalated, to £153,318 on an income of £227,845 in 1920, and carriage by the company ceased in 1921, in an attempt to reduce losses. 433,230 tons of goods carried in 1929 had dropped to 151,144 tons in 1940, by which time income from tolls was £17,763, and total income was £40,985.

==Route==

The River Dee branch heads eastwards from the river, and passes through two locks before turning to the north. Another two locks raise its level to that of the Ellesmere Canal, and the junction was the site of a historic boatyard. Originally, the branch continued eastwards after the first two locks, and another two brought it up to the level of the Chester Canal main line. From the junction, the Ellesmere main line headed south, to another right-angled band where it joined the Chester Canal. There are moorings at Tower Wharf, just before the bend. To the south of the canal is the old city, one of the few English cities which retains nearly all of its city walls, the cathedral much of which dates from 1092, and the King Charles&#x27; Tower, which overshadows the canal. After rising through the Northgate Staircase locks, which were cut out of solid rock, the canal enters a steep-sided rock cutting. After several bridges, the first of five locks which raise the level of the canal by another is reached. Between the fourth and fifth locks, the North Wales Coast railway line to crosses under the canal in a tunnel.

The canal passes along the south-western edge of Christleton, and through the centre of Waverton, where there is a large grade II listed mill building, which was once steam powered and includes bays in the right gable from which boats were loaded. The parish church is some distance from the main centre of population, on the edge of the flat Cheshire plain. The tall tower dates from the 16th century, and the roof of the nave is of hammer-beam construction, dating from 1635. There are several accommodation bridges on this section, all dating from the time of the construction of the canal, including Davies Bridge, Salmon&#x27;s Bridge, and Faulkners Bridge, all built in orange brick and grade II listed structures. The railway line to Crewe follows the same general alignment as the canal, but a little further to the south, as both follow the valley of the River Gowy. The canal crosses from the south bank of the river to the north bank on an aqueduct and continues eastwards, passing the massive ruined remains of Beeston Castle, which was built in the 1220s by the Earl of Chester on top of a steep hill, and dominates the countryside.

The castle is opposite Wharton&#x27;s Lock, which is followed by the village of Tiverton on the north bank. Immediately after a bridge carrying the A49 road over the canal is the first of the two Beeston locks. The first is called Beeston Iron Lock, and was built from cast iron plates in 1828 by Telford. Cast iron was used because of problems with running sand under the original stone locks. It is both a grade II* listed structure and a scheduled ancient monument, and is unique in England. Shortly afterwards is Beeston Stone Lock, also a listed structure, but dating from the construction of the canal and using conventional materials.

The next lock is Tilston Lock, situated about to the north of Bunbury. The railway crosses to the north side of the canal near Bunbury Staircase Locks, a staircase of two locks which share the intermediate gates. These are the last locks before the end of the Chester canal, and are the last locks which wide-beam boats can use when travelling south. As the canal approaches Barbridge Junction, the railway turns away, heading east, and the canal turns towards the south. The junction is the start of the Middlewich Branch, which descends through four locks to reach the Trent and Mersey Canal at Middlewich. After another , the Llangollen Canal turns off at Hurleston Junction immediately rising through four locks. Soon, Nantwich Basin is reached, which was the historic terminus of the Chester Canal. Telford&#x27;s original plan was to terminate the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal by running it across Dorfold Park and joining the basin end-on, but the owner objected, and an embankment had to be built around the edge of the park. This crossed the road on Nantwich Aqueduct, and joined the canal just to the north of the basin. Dorfold Hall, to the west of the basin, is a grade I listed mansion, built in 1616 for Ralph Wilbraham.

===Boat sizes===
As built, the locks on the Chester Canal were originally . Over the years the maximum size for vessels using the canal has altered. By 1985, it had been reduced to , and in 2009, sizes were quoted as .

<doc id="415077" wikidata="Q13533356" url="?curid=415077" title="John Held Jr.">
<text>John James Held Jr. (January 10, 1889 – March 2, 1958) was an American cartoonist, printmaker, illustrator, sculptor, and author. One of the best-known magazine illustrators of the 1920s, his most popular works were his uniquely styled cartoons which depicted people dancing, driving, playing sports, and engaging in other popular activities of the era.

Held grew up in an artistic family that encouraged his pursuit of arts from the beginning. He began selling pieces of art by the age of nine. He never graduated from high school, finding his time was better spent honing his skills which he began at &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; as a sports illustrator during his late teenage years. His friendship with Harold Ross, creator of &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; served him well in his career, as his cartoons were featured in many prominent magazines including &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, and &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

Held was praised for his cartoon depictions of the cultural paradigm shift in the 1920s. The drawings depicted the flapper era in a way that both satirized and influenced the styles and mores of the time, and his images have continued to define the Jazz Age for subsequent generations.

==Youth==
The oldest of six children, John Held Jr. was born in Salt Lake City, to Annie Evans and John Lyman Held, who met at a church social. His father was born in Geneva, Switzerland to Jacques Held, a watchmaker, and was noticed by Mormon educator John R. Park who was scouting Europe for talented young people. He adopted Held Sr. and brought him back to Salt Lake City. He decided not to pursue a career as an educator like his mentor, but instead pursued a diverse career in copperplate engraving, manufacturing fountain pens, and operating a stationery shop. He privately developed his musical abilities on the cornet and organized Held&#x27;s Band, which performed at all major Utah events for about fifty years. John Held Sr. contributed illustrations to the 1888 &quot;The Story of the Book of Mormon&quot;. Annie Evans, his mother, acted in the local theater. John Held Jr.&#x27;s maternal grandfather, James Evans, was an English convert to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who traveled to Salt Lake City with the Mormon handcart pioneers.

Thriving in a home where the arts were appreciated and encouraged, Held showed a talent for the arts at a young age. He learned woodcutting and engraving from his father, and sold a drawing to a local newspaper at the age of nine. The wood block was his preferred medium in his youth and he would return to it several times throughout his career. He loved Western culture including horses, deserts, and cowboys, and this was a recurring theme in his art, both as a child and as an adult. He sold his first cartoon, a Western-themed one, to &quot;Life&quot; magazine at the age of 15.

In 1905, he began working as a sports illustrator and cartoonist at the &quot;Salt Lake City Tribune&quot; with his fellow West High School classmate Harold Ross. During his years at the &quot;Tribune&quot;, he obtained no formal art instruction claiming that his only teachers were his father and the sculptor Mahonri M. Young, a grandson of Brigham Young. In 1910 Held married Myrtle Jennings, the &quot;Tribune&quot;&#x27;s society editor. In 1912 he relocated to New York, without his wife, to find a good job. While living in a flat with Hal Burrows and Mahonri Young, he drew posters for Collier&#x27;s Street Railway Advertising Company and ads for Wanamaker&#x27;s Department Store, and designed costumes and sets for the theater to make ends meet. In 1914, he returned to his linoleum block print style.

==Cartoons and covers==

In 1915 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; began publishing his drawings, for which he used the pseudonym &quot;Myrtle Held&quot;, because he was too shy to use his own name. He also began doing woodcuts for his &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot; series, which would be published in limited quantity in 1930 and greater quantity in 1971.

During World War I, Held worked for US Naval Intelligence in Central America as an artist and cartographer. During this commission, he participated in an expedition co-sponsored by the American Museum of Natural History and the Carnegie Foundation with archaeologists Sylanus Morley and Herbert Spinden. His duties were to look for German submarine activity off-shore, make coastal maps, sketch any signs of military operation, and record the Mayan hieroglyphics and sketch any finds in the expedition. His friend and roommate Marc Connelly, a famous American playwright, later wrote of Held&#x27;s distinct humor, recounting that he teased friend Ernest Haskell for wearing a terrible homemade camouflage costume by crying out, &quot;My God! Where&#x27;s Ernie?&quot;
In 1925, his old high school friend Harold Ross started &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. By 1927, Held&#x27;s work had appeared in &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and he had also contributed illustrations for other influential magazines, including &quot;Judge&quot; and &quot;The Smart Set&quot;. His work, which quickly became popular, defined the &quot;funny, stylish image of the flapper with her cigarette holder, shingle bob and turned-down hose and of her slick-haired boyfriend in puffy pants and raccoon coat,&quot; whom he named Betty Co-ed and Joe College; the perfect archetypes for the generation. According to Held, he didn&#x27;t really intend to create the flapper ideal; he just drew what was around him, and it became popular so he kept drawing. He was reportedly becoming so popular that people were sending him blank checks, offering anything for an original piece. From a 1957 interview with the &quot;New York Post,&quot; an editor explained that Held was seen as a man who could pull a magazine out of trouble, which made his cartoons valuable and coveted.

He wrote and drew two newspaper comic strips, &quot;Oh! Margy&quot; and its sequel &quot;Merely Margy&quot; and &quot;Rah Rah Rosalie&quot;. After F. Scott Fitzgerald complained that William Hill designed the characters on his covers to look too much like himself and his wife Zelda, Fitzgerald hired Held to illustrate his book covers, after taking a liking to his cartoon style. This represented the stylistic shift of the period from realism to abstraction which influenced the Art-Deco style of the decade. Held&#x27;s first cover for Fitzgerald was a companion book of short stories for &quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot;, and he subsequently illustrated &quot;Tales of the Jazz Age&quot; (1922) and &quot;The Vegetable&quot; (1923). Held also designed the cover for Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, &quot;So Big.&quot;

In addition to his archetypical flapper illustrations, Held also made linocuts and drew cartoons in a 19th-century woodcut style, as he had started getting bored with the flapper girls. During this time period, his art often depicted the &quot;Gay Nineties&quot;. From 1925 to 1932, his woodcut-style cartoons and faux maps were published frequently in &quot;The New Yorker.&quot; Held Jr slipped occasional imagery alluding to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints such as temples, the acronym ZCMI, the Angel Moroni, and Brigham Young, and though some people believe he sneaked them in, Ross was fully aware of it and actually encouraged it. Held portrayed a satirical view of the Roaring Twenties, often criticizing the drinking, gambling, and rampant sexuality that often characterized the decade. This contrasted his counterparts in Jazz-Age cartoons such as Peter Arno who seemed to celebrate it. Held also created the iconic &quot;Wise Men Fish Here&quot; sign which hung above the door of the Gotham Book Mart for the life of the store.

During the Great Depression Held lost much of his money in the Ivar Kreuger fraud scheme. His last &quot;New Yorker&quot; illustration appeared in 1932. Held wrote and illustrated several novels, such as &quot;Grim Youth&quot; (1930) and &quot;The Flesh Is Weak&quot; (1931). The reduced demand for his cartoons in the 1930s gave him more time to paint. During this time, he painted somber landscapes and cityscapes, while also illustrating children&#x27;s books and animal fantasies. He loved animals and depicted them frequently, but rarely used them for satire, because he found humans more strange and amusing. He also published &quot;The Works of John Held Jr.&quot; in 1931.

In 1937, he designed sets for the Broadway comedy revue &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot;, and produced the &quot;Tops Variety Show&quot; which showcased young talent. He exhibited his bronze sculptures of horses in New York in 1939 at Bland Gallery. He was named artist-in residence at Harvard and the University of Georgia by the Carnegie Corporation where he taught students and focused on sculpting. He moved to a dairy farm in Wall, New Jersey in 1943 working as a free-lance artist and illustrating children&#x27;s books, after serving with his wife in the area during World War II in the U.S. Army Signal Corps, painting pictures of radar apparatus. In the 1950s, popular nostalgia for the 1920s resulted in a revival of interest in Held&#x27;s earlier works, as the first edition of &quot;Playboy&quot; featured a reprint of Held&#x27;s &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot; cartoons.

==Style==
Held was unorthodox among the artists of the decade, as he was uninterested in copying European art and made his own way stylistically. Pointillism was the only exception as he occasionally painted in this style up until 1931, taking inspiration from Georges Seurat. He claimed to be influenced by the Ashcan School early on in his career. Held admired the caricatural quality of Greek vase painting. He was also inspired by the Mayan geometric designs he saw during his time in Central America in 1917, using them as elements of his art rather than the foundation of it.

The angular style of Held&#x27;s drawings depicting the Roaring Twenties has sometimes been incorrectly defined as Art Deco, according to art historian Carl Weidhardt. His classic style is represented by the exaggeratedly tall and skinny, yet anatomically correct flapper women that made him famous, shown in minimal detail with a high influence of angle and diagonal lines and a comedic use of color. In the midst of his long career, he began to loathe the characters he created, but looking back towards the end of his life, he was amazed by the uproar and social criticism that those women evoked. Having stated that he wasn&#x27;t sure whether religion created his interest in geography or vice versa, he was also known for his satirical cartography, which contained cartoons and purposefully unrealistic geographical proportions.

Throughout his career, Held used woodblock, linocut, bronze, pen, and paint and he painted everything from maps to cartoons, to scenery and accurate animal portraits. Even though his art was so varied in style, there was unity in effect.

Corey Ford described Held as both the recorder and the setter of popular styles and manners of the Jazz Age:His angular and scantily clad flapper was accepted by scandalized elders as the prototype of modern youth, the symbol of our moral revolution ... Week after week in &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Judge&quot; and &quot;College Humor&quot;, they danced the Charleston with ropes of beads swinging and bracelets clanking and legs kicking at right angles ... So sedulously did we ape his caricatures that they lost their satiric point and came to be a documentary record of our time.

==Personal life==
Held made an enormous fortune in the 1920s and became a part of the high-society life that he depicted in his art.

Held was married four times. He married Myrtle Jennings in 1910. After a divorce, he married Ada Johnson in 1918. During the 1920s the couple adopted three children. He served as constable of Weston, Connecticut and ran for Congress as a Democrat. The campaign was unsuccessful, much to his relief, because he never left his house nor gave a speech.

After the stock market crash, he suffered a nervous breakdown, selling his home in Connecticut, which led to his divorce from his second wife. In 1932, Held married Miss New Orleans Gladys Moore, and had a daughter named Judy. In 1942, he married Margaret Schuyler James, with whom he had a happy marriage. He spent the last years of his life on Old Schuyler Farm in Belmar, New Jersey, with animals and a new family. He died in 1958, aged 69, from throat cancer.

== Legacy ==
In 1927, Held was nominated for the &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; Hall of Fame: &quot;Because as a caricaturist, he invented the modern flapper; because last year he was almost elected a member of Congress from Connecticut; because he is a syndicated artist who has not lost his flair for drawing and satire; because he is a born comedian.&quot; Even after his death he has been the subject of many galleries and exhibitions. In 1967, his work was showcased from October to November at the Art Association of Indianapolis in an exhibition titled, &quot;John Held, Jr.&quot;. The next year, from November to December, the Rhode Island School of Design presented &quot;The Jazz Age&quot;, featuring Held and two other artists. The Smithsonian Institution featured a nationwide traveling exhibition from 1969 to 1972 called &quot;The Art of John Held, Jr.&quot;

<text>The Portuguese Grand Prix () is a motorsports event that was first held in 1951 as a sportscar event, and then intermittently disappearing for many years before being revived again. In 1964 event was held as a sportscar race, and the 1965 and 1966 editions being held for Formula Three entrants. The event was part of the Formula One World Championship in 1958–1960, then again between 1984 and 1996, and after a long hiatus, it was revived for 2020 and 2021. The event has been held at several circuits throughout its history.

==History==

===Boavista and Monsanto (1951–1960)===


The first event was held on the Boavista street course in Porto on 17 June 1951 as a sports car race. The Grand Prix was moved to Monsanto Park, Lisbon, in 1954 as a one-off. Monsanto, like the Boavista circuit, was a hazardous street circuit lined with trees and had many elevation change and fast sweepers; but Monsanto was quite wide as opposed to Boavista, which was narrow. Sportscar events continued until 1957 when the following year it became part of the Formula One world championship.
The first Formula One race was held on 14 August 1958 in Boavista. This circuit was situated in a hazardous area; it was laid out through the town and included sections of cobbled streets and even tramlines. British drivers Stirling Moss in a Vanwall and Mike Hawthorn in a Ferrari were at the top of the championship table, battling it out for the first eight rain-interrupted laps. Moss then pulled away as Hawthorn slipped behind Frenchman Jean Behra in a BRM until the British car hit spark plug problems. But the drama was only just beginning as a protest was made against Hawthorn who, it was claimed when he had restarted his car had driven a few yards in the wrong direction, which was against the rules and meant that Hawthorn was to be disqualified. As soon as he heard it, Moss headed to the stewards and told them Hawthorn had been off the course when he was spotted and that was not against the rules. Moss&#x27;s evidence swung the decision, and no action was taken. Had the protest been upheld, Hawthorn would have lost seven points – six for finishing second and an extra one for recording the fastest lap. In the event, Moss&#x27;s intervention allowed Hawthorn to win the Drivers&#x27; Championship title by one point – from Moss.
This race was followed in 1959 by a Grand Prix at Monsanto, which was won again by Moss, this time in a mid-engined Cooper. Australian Jack Brabham hit a telegraph pole after swerving to hit the twice lapped local driver Mario Cabral; Brabham was thrown out of the car and landed on the track; he was then narrowly missed by American Masten Gregory.
After this race, Monsanto Park was abandoned, and F1 returned to Boavista in 1960. This race was won by Brabham in a Cooper. The Portuguese Grand Prix was then discontinued and did not return until 1984.

The name was resurrected for a sports car sprint event in the Cascais street circuit in 1964. The following two years, it was run for Formula Three cars.

===Estoril (1984–1996)===

The seeds for the return of the Portuguese Grand Prix were planted with the inauguration of the Autódromo do Estoril near the capital of Lisbon in 1972. The Estoril Grand Prix was held as a European Formula Two Championship event during the 1970s. This circuit was to see some of the most memorable and exciting races in Formula One&#x27;s history. On 21 October 1984, Portugal returned to the F1 calendar, ending the season, where Frenchman Alain Prost won the race but failed to win the Championship by half a point from his teammate, Austrian Niki Lauda who finished 2nd in the race. In 1985, the Grand Prix was moved to 21 April and held under heavy rain, the ideal conditions for Ayrton Senna to win his first race. From 1986, the race was held in what would become its traditional date, in the penultimate week of September; this race was won by Briton Nigel Mansell. 1987 saw Prost win his 28th Grand Prix, breaking Jackie Stewart&#x27;s 14-year-old record; and 1988 was to see controversy between Prost and his McLaren teammate Senna. Coming out of the long Parabolica corner, Prost lined up to pass Senna but in an attempt to stop him, the Brazilian squeezed the Frenchman and he nearly hit the wall separating the pit lane from the track; but Prost kept his foot flat and passed Senna going into the first corner. Prost, a mild-mannered driver, was angry with Senna. This one incident between the world&#x27;s two best Formula One drivers at the time led to one of the most famous sporting rivalries in history. 1989 saw yet more controversy; Mansell, now driving a Ferrari, overshot his pit lane entrance; and, against his team&#x27;s gesticulations, went into reverse gear and backed into his pit stop position, which was against the rules. Sometime after Mansell went out, he was given the black disqualification flag. He did not go in, however, and as he came up to pass Senna who was leading while passing the pits and being shown the black flag again, Mansell ducked out, Senna turned into the Ferrari and both drivers went off the track and into the run-off area. This incident just about destroyed Senna&#x27;s 1989 championship chances. Because he had failed to score any points at this event, he now had to win all 3 races to stand any chance of beating his teammate and rival Prost, who finished 2nd to Mansell&#x27;s teammate, Austrian Gerhard Berger. Mansell and Ferrari were both fined $50,000 and the Englishman was banned for the next race, the Spanish Grand Prix.

1990 saw an incredibly exciting race, as Senna, Prost, Mansell and Berger all battled hard to gain top honors; Mansell made a very poor start and nearly took out his Ferrari teammate Prost, which allowed Senna and Berger to slip by and take 1st and 2nd. Mansell and Prost fought back; it also saw backmarker Philippe Alliot nearly take out the leader Mansell and crash heavily at the second corner; Alex Caffi and Aguri Suzuki crashed their cars on lap 59; the marshals could not get the cars off the track and the race was called short. Mansell won from Senna and Prost; Berger finished 4th. 1991 saw yet more drama: Mansell (now driving for Williams) then saw his own championship chances start to fade when he came into the pits to change his tires; however the rear right wheel was not fastened down properly and when Mansell went out, he only went about 50 feet before the right rear wheel came off. He was stuck in the middle of the pit road, unable to move. Mansell then reversed the Williams, and the Williams mechanics ran to the stricken car and lifted it bodily while in the pit road and fitted the rear tire properly; which took about a minute. These actions broke all sorts of rules, and Mansell, after coming out in 17th place, was shown the black flag. He had come up to 6th by the time he was disqualified; the race was won by the Englishman&#x27;s Italian teammate Riccardo Patrese. 1992 saw Mansell win and Patrese have a horrific crash after he hit the back of Gerhard Berger&#x27;s McLaren and was launched into the air while next to the pit lane. The car came down and scraped alongside the pit wall; no one was injured. 1993 saw Alain Prost win his fourth and final Drivers&#x27; Championship driving for Williams; he finished 2nd in the race to German Michael Schumacher in a Benetton.

1994 saw a change to the circuit in response to the deaths of Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at Imola. The Esses corner before the Parabolica was made into a 3 corner sequence; the race was won by Williams driver Damon Hill, and 1995 saw a huge accident at the start involving Ukyo Katayama in a Tyrrell; the race was won by David Coulthard. 1996 saw Canadian rookie Jacques Villeneuve in a Williams pass Schumacher on the outside of the Parabolica, and the Canadian won the race. The track tended to promote close racing and the weather was usually good although as Estoril is only a few miles from the westernmost point of Europe, it tended to be affected by stiff breezes and rain storms coming off the Atlantic Ocean. A bigger problem, however, was the local attitude towards the circuit. The FIA asked time and again for the track&#x27;s facilities to be improved, but nothing was done. In 1997 the governing body called Portugal&#x27;s bluff; promised renovation work was not done and so the race was cancelled. Estoril was planned to be the final race of the 1997 season, but it was replaced with the European Grand Prix, which was held at Jerez in Spain. Portugal&#x27;s Economy Minister Augusto Mateus immediately announced that the government was going to provide the $6 million necessary for the work and that the race was not going to be cancelled but he was wrong. In an effort to speed up the work the Portuguese government bought a controlling interest in the company that owned the track. The Portuguese GP was listed on the calendar but was cancelled when the upgrading work could not be completed in time.

===Absence===

On 4 April 2009, Max Mosley stated that based on the quality of the Algarve International Circuit, the Portuguese Grand Prix could be integrated into the Formula One championship, as long as a commercial agreement with the Formula One Management is achieved. 

===Portimão (2020–2021) ===

The race returned for the 2020 season, this time at the Algarve International Circuit in Portimão, to help the sport fill its calendar in light of other races being cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race was held on 25 October 2020 and was the first Grand Prix for this venue. The race saw Lewis Hamilton score his 92nd Grand Prix win breaking Michael Schumacher&#x27;s previous record for most Formula One Grand Prix wins. The circuit hosted an additional race in 2021.

<text>George Syncellus (, &quot;Georgios Synkellos&quot;; died after 810) was a Byzantine chronicler and ecclesiastical official. He lived many years in Palestine (probably in the Old Lavra of Saint Chariton or Souka, near Tekoa) as a monk, before coming to Constantinople, where he was appointed &quot;synkellos&quot; (literally, &quot;cell-mate&quot;) to Tarasius, patriarch of Constantinople. He later retired to a monastery to write what was intended to be his great work, a chronicle of world history, &quot;Ekloge chronographias&quot; (), or &quot;Extract of Chronography&quot;. According to Anastasius Bibliothecarius, George &quot;struggled valiantly against heresy [i.e. Iconoclasm] and received many punishments from the rulers who raged against the rites of the Church&quot;, although the accuracy of the claim is suspect.

As a &quot;synkellos&quot;, George stood high in the ecclesiastical establishment of Constantinople. The position carried no defined duties, but the incumbent would generally serve as the patriarch&#x27;s private secretary, and might also be used by the Emperor to limit the movements and actions of a troublesome patriarch (as was the case during the reign of Constantine VI, when several of George&#x27;s colleagues were set as guards over Patriarch Tarasius). The office would be an imperial gift by the time of Basil I, and was probably so earlier; as such, George may well have owed his position to the Empress Irene. Many &quot;synkelloi&quot; would go on to become Patriarchs of Constantinople, or Bishops of other sees (for example George&#x27;s colleague, John, another &quot;synkellos&quot; under Patriarch Tarasius, who became Metropolitan Bishop of Sardis in 803). 

George, however, did not follow this path, instead retreating from the world to compose his great chronicle. It would appear that the Emperor Nikephoros I incurred George&#x27;s disfavour at around the same time: in 808, Nikephoros discovered a plot against him, and punished the suspected conspirators, amongst whom were not only secular figures &quot;but also holy bishops and monks and clergy of the Great Church, including the &quot;synkellos&quot;...men of high repute and worthy of respect&quot;; it is unknown whether the &quot;synkellos&quot; in question was George himself or a colleague/successor, but the attack on the clergy, including George&#x27;s friends and colleagues, would not have endeared the Emperor to George, and is suggested as the motivating factor in the &quot;pathological hatred&quot; towards Nikephoros I in the chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor The date of his death is uncertain; a reference in his chronicle makes clear that he was still alive in 810, and he is sometimes described as dying in 811, but there is no evidence for this, and textual evidence in the &quot;Chronicle of Theophanes&quot; suggests that he was still alive in 813.

His chronicle, as its title implies, is more of a chronological table with notes than a history. Following on from the Syriac chroniclers of his homeland, who were writing in his lifetime under Arab rule in much the same fashion, as well as the Alexandrians Annianus and Panodorus (monks who wrote near the beginning of the 5th century), George used the chronological synchronic structures of Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius of Caesarea, arranging his events strictly in order of time, and naming them in the year which they happened. Consequently, the narrative is regarded as secondary to the need to reference the relation of each event to other events, and as such is continually interrupted by long tables of dates, so markedly that Krumbacher described it as being &quot;rather a great historical list [&quot;Geschichtstabelle&quot;] with added explanations, than a universal history.&quot; 

George reveals himself as a staunch upholder of orthodoxy, and quotes Greek Fathers such as Gregory Nazianzen and John Chrysostom. But in spite of its religious bias and dry and uninteresting character, the fragments of ancient writers and apocryphal books preserved in it make it especially valuable. For instance, considerable portions of the original text of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; of Eusebius have been restored by the aid of George&#x27;s work. His chief authorities were Annianus of Alexandria and Panodorus of Alexandria, through whom George acquired much of his knowledge of the history of Manetho; George also relied heavily on Eusebius, Dexippus and Sextus Julius Africanus.

George&#x27;s chronicle was continued after his death by his friend Theophanes; Theophanes&#x27;s work was heavily shaped by George&#x27;s influence, and the latter may have had a greater influence on Theophanes&#x27;s Chronicle than Theophanes himself. Anastasius, the Papal Librarian, composed a &quot;Historia tripartita&quot; in Latin, from the chronicles of George Syncellus, Theophanes Confessor, and Patriarch Nicephorus. This work, written between 873 and 875, spread George&#x27;s preferenced dates for historical events through the West. Meanwhile, in the East George&#x27;s fame was gradually overshadowed by that of Theophanes.

<text>James Aloysius Joseph Patrick Gabriel Wray (28 April 1935 – 25 May 2013) was a Scottish politician and Labour Member of Parliament for Glasgow Baillieston and Glasgow Provan.

Born and raised in the Gorbals, he was one of eight children born in an economically disadvantaged Roman Catholic family. A boxer in his younger days, he was elected as a councillor to the then Glasgow Town Council in 1964 for Kelvinside, and moved over to the larger Strathclyde Regional Council in 1975 for Gorbals. He successfully blocked implementation of fluoridation in court by arguing it violated the 1946 Water Act and the 1968 Medicine Act.

Wray became a rag and bone man, a coalman and a lorry driver, owning a fleet of lorries and a coal business, and became a property developer. By the time he became an MP, Wray was a wealthy man. He was on the left-wing of the Labour Party, and joined the Campaign Group. His political stances were Eurosceptic, an advocate of Irish republicanism regarding Northern Ireland, and opposed to abortion and the abolition of Section 28. His views on Northern Ireland led him to be tagged &quot;I.R. Wray&quot; by &quot;Private Eye&quot;. In 2002, he attacked the Scottish Parliament, labelling its members &quot;odds and sods&quot;.

Wray stood down as an MP, aged 70, at the 2005 general election following a stroke in December 2003.

==Death==
Wray died on 25 May 2013 in Mearnskirk Home Hospital in Renfrewshire after suffering from bowel cancer, aged 78. He had two daughters and two sons.

<doc id="415084" wikidata="Q835207" url="?curid=415084" title="Central Collegiate Hockey Association">
<text>The Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) is a college athletic conference in the Midwestern United States that participates in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I as a hockey-only conference. The current CCHA began play in the 2021–22 season; a previous incarnation, which the current CCHA recognizes as part of its history, existed from 1971 to 2013. Four of its nine members are located in the state of Michigan, with three in Minnesota and one each in Ohio and South Dakota. It has also had teams located in Alaska, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and Nebraska over the course of its existence.

The CCHA was disbanded after the 2012–13 season as the result of a conference realignment stemming from the Big Ten Conference (of which three CCHA schools; Michigan, Michigan State, and Ohio State, were primary members) choosing to sponsor Division I ice hockey beginning in the 2013–14 season. The remaining CCHA members received invitations to other conferences, such as the newly formed National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC), Hockey East, and the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA), which itself had been depleted by the Big Ten and NCHC. The conference&#x27;s last game before its hiatus was the final of the 2013 CCHA Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Tournament at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, where Notre Dame beat Michigan 3–1 to win the Mason Cup championship.

On February 18, 2020, seven schools who had applied to leave the WCHA announced they would form a new CCHA for the 2021–22 season, citing a more compact geographic footprint and a desire to improve regional alignment, among other reasons. St. Thomas, a former D-III school, joined them later that year as the CCHA&#x27;s newest member as well as the conference&#x27;s eighth team.

==History==
===Foundation===
The CCHA began in 1971 as an NCAA conference composed of Bowling Green, Ohio, Ohio State and Saint Louis. After adding Lake Superior State for year two, both Ohio State and Ohio withdrew from the conference, leaving the CCHA with a scant 3 members. Despite the trouble, the three teams rode out the rough patch and the league began to grow with the addition of Western Michigan and the return of Ohio State.

===NCAA acceptance===
Up until 1976 the NCAA had only offered bids to the tournament from teams in either ECAC Hockey or the WCHA. Because those were the only two Division I conferences for most years there was no controversy but, after the CCHA had proved to be more than just a flash in the pan, the tournament had to change. Beginning with the 1977 Championship the NCAA allowed itself the freedom to add up to four additional teams to the tournament with the understanding that the CCHA tournament champion would receive one of the additional bids. Bowling Green won the first tournament game for the conference but it was not until Northern Michigan reached the championship game in 1980 that the league began to gain acceptance.

===WCHA defectors===
1981 saw a major shift in college ice hockey with four teams from the WCHA defecting to the CCHA. The move was done as a way to reduce travel costs as well as provide the new team with a better chance at making the NCAA Tournament (many of the CCHA teams were still seen as lesser programs). Michigan State made the tournament in its first three season of CCHA play but it was founding member Bowling Green that won the conference&#x27;s first national championship in 1984.

===National prominence===
Bill Beagan served as commissioner of the CCHA from 1985 to 1998. He implemented a pre-season training camp for referees, despite the officials going on strike in protest. He developed a working relationship with the NHL to develop future officials in collegiate hockey.

He sought to have CCHA games televised as a game-of-the-week, and signed the first national television contract for colleges in the United States. He brought in cable television partners which included the Pro Am Sports System and Fox Sports Net. He introduced instant replay to the CCHA in 1993, to be used at its league championships, and arranged for the CCHA Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Tournament finals to be played at Joe Louis Arena. He was credited with coining the phrase, &quot;Road to the Joe&quot;, in reference to end-of-year tournament culminating at the Joe Louis Arena.

Prior to Beagan&#x27;s arrival, the CCHA had not been a profitable association. After 10 years as commissioner, the league had made $4 million. Profits were shared with the schools, which were reinvested into hockey programs and new arenas. On-ice results improved during his tenure, and CCHA teams won six NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Tournament championships. In addition, Beagan convinced the University of Notre Dame to resurrect its hockey program in 1992.

Building on Bowling Green State&#x27;s national title in 1984, the CCHA established itself further as the Michigan State Spartans won their second national championship and first as a member of the CCHA in 1986, and the Lake Superior State Lakers won the 1988 national championship, their first NCAA championship. The Lake Superior State Lakers would continue their NCAA success by winning both the 1992 and 1994 NCAA ice hockey championships and finishing as the national runner-up in 1993. In addition to the success of the Lakers and Spartans, the Michigan Wolverines began a streak of 22 consecutive tournament appearances in 1991 and won national titles in 1996 and 1998. While the conference and most of its teams were stable throughout the early 21st century, the CCHA suffered a mortal blow at the end of the decade.

===Realignment and discontinuation===

Pennsylvania State University announced on September 17, 2010, the transition of its men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) programs to NCAA Division I status in 2012. Just over a month earlier, then-commissioner Tom Anastos publicly stated that the CCHA would strongly consider adding Penn State as the conference&#x27;s 12th member. Instead, the league was left to deal with the imminent departures of Michigan, Michigan State and Ohio State when the Big Ten Conference disclosed on March 21, 2011, its intention to establish a men&#x27;s ice hockey circuit to begin play in the 2013–14 season, as the conference now had enough hockey teams to earn an automatic bid in the NCAA tournament for its champion. Joining the existing CCHA members were the University of Minnesota and the University of Wisconsin from the WCHA, as well as Penn State.

The next school slated to leave the CCHA in 2013 was Miami University which became a charter member of the NCHC on July 15, 2011. Western Michigan accepted an invitation to join the new league just over two months later on September 22.

The demise of the CCHA was further accelerated when five members decided to move to the WCHA following the 2012–13 campaign. Northern Michigan University, returning to the WCHA after leaving in 1997, was the first to make the announcement on July 20, followed by Alaska, Ferris State and Lake Superior State on August 26 and Bowling Green on October 4.

Notre Dame accepted an invitation to the Hockey East Association in a press conference on October 5, 2011.

===Revival===
On June 28, 2019, seven schools from the ten-member WCHA began the process of withdrawing from the conference, with the intent of forming a new conference for the 2021–22 season. These seven schools were Bemidji State, Bowling Green (who had retained the rights to the CCHA name), Ferris State, Lake Superior State, Michigan Tech, Minnesota State and Northern Michigan. The seven schools cited a more compact geographic footprint as one reason for the move; the remaining three WCHA members, Alabama-Huntsville, Alaska and Alaska–Anchorage, all geographic outliers in the WCHA, were notably absent. On February 18, 2020, these seven schools announced they would begin competing in a new CCHA in 2021–22. Later that year, the University of St. Thomas, a former D-III school who had been granted a waiver by the NCAA earlier in the year to transition directly to D-I, was announced to be joining the new CCHA as a member on July 29, 2020, bringing the membership up to an even eight teams.

Don Lucia, a former head coach at Alaska, Colorado College, and Minnesota, was named as commissioner of the new CCHA on June 17, 2020. A new league logo was introduced shortly thereafter.

On May 17, 2022, Augustana University was announced as the league&#x27;s ninth member. The Vikings will play a partial league schedule in the 2023–24 and 2024–25 seasons before playing a full league schedule in 2025–26.

On May 15, 2024, St. Thomas announced they would leave the league following the 2025–26 season to become the tenth member of the NCHC. This will return the league to eight member schools.

At the conclusion of each regular season schedule the coaches of each CCHA team vote which players they choose to be on the three All-Conference Teams: first team, second team and rookie team. Additionally they vote to award up to 9 of the 12 individual trophies to an eligible player at the same time (depending upon the year). The CCHA also awards a Perani Cup, a Humanitarian Award, which are awarded rather than voted upon, and a Most Valuable Player in Tournament which is voted on at the conclusion of the conference tournament. None of the individual awards conferred by the CCHA have been given for the entire existence of the conference. Only the Tournament MVP was awarded in the inaugural CCHA season, but that award was discontinued thereafter until 1982. Several of the aforementioned awards were revived along with the league in 2021–22. The awards presented by the original CCHA for best offensive and defensive defenseman were merged into a single award for best defenseman, and the original CCHA&#x27;s award for best defensive forward was folded into the award for best forward.

<text>The headwater of a river or stream is the point on each of its tributaries upstream from its mouth or estuary into a lake, sea, or confluence with another river. Each headwater is considered one of the river&#x27;s sources, as it is the place where surface runoffs from rainwater, meltwater, or spring water begin accumulating into a more substantial and consistent flow that becomes a first-order tributary of that river. The tributary with the longest course downstream of the headwaters is regarded as the main stem.

==Definition==

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) states that a river&#x27;s &quot;length may be considered to be the distance from the mouth to the most distant headwater source (irrespective of stream name), or from the mouth to the headwaters of the stream commonly known as the source stream&quot;. As an example of the second definition above, the USGS at times considers the Missouri River as a tributary of the Mississippi River. But it also follows the first definition above (along with virtually all other geographic authorities and publications) in using the combined Missouri—lower Mississippi length figure in lists of lengths of rivers around the world. Most rivers have numerous tributaries and change names often; it is customary to regard the longest tributary or stem as the source, regardless of what name that watercourse may carry on local maps and in local usage.

This most commonly identified definition of a river source specifically uses the most distant point (along watercourses from the river mouth) in the drainage basin from which water runs year-around (perennially), or, alternatively, as the furthest point from which water could possibly flow ephemerally. The latter definition includes sometimes-dry channels and removes any possible definitions that would have the river source &quot;move around&quot; from month to month depending on precipitation or ground water levels. This definition, from geographer Andrew Johnston of the Smithsonian Institution, is also used by the National Geographic Society when pinpointing the source of rivers such as the Amazon or Nile. A definition given by the state of Montana agrees, stating that a river source is never a confluence but is &quot;in a location that is the farthest, along water miles, from where that river ends.&quot;

Under this definition, neither a lake (excepting lakes with no inflows) nor a confluence of tributaries can be a true river source, though both often provide the starting point for the portion of a river carrying a single name. For example, National Geographic and virtually every other geographic authority and atlas define the source of the Nile River not as Lake Victoria&#x27;s outlet where the name &quot;Nile&quot; first appears, which would reduce the Nile&#x27;s length by over (dropping it to fourth or fifth on the list of world&#x27;s rivers), but instead use the source of the largest river flowing &quot;into&quot; the lake, the Kagera River. Likewise, the source of the Amazon River has been determined this way, even though the river changes names numerous times along its course. However, the source of the Thames in England is traditionally reckoned according to the named river Thames rather than its longer tributary, the Churn — although not without contention.

When not listing river lengths, however, alternative definitions may be used. The Missouri River&#x27;s source is named by some USGS and other federal and state agency sources, following Lewis and Clark&#x27;s naming convention, as the confluence of the Madison and Jefferson rivers, rather than the source of its longest tributary (the Jefferson). This contradicts the most common definition, which is, according to a US Army Corps of Engineers official on a USGS site, that &quot;[geographers] generally follow the longest tributary to identify the source of rivers and streams.&quot; In the case of the Missouri River, this would have the source be well upstream from Lewis and Clark&#x27;s confluence, &quot;following the Jefferson River to the Beaverhead River to Red Rock River, then Red Rock Creek to Hell Roaring Creek.&quot;

==Characteristics==

Sometimes the source of the most remote tributary may be in an area that is more marsh-like, in which the &quot;uppermost&quot; or most remote section of the marsh would be the true source. For example, the source of the River Tees is marshland.

The furthest stream is also often called the head stream. Headwaters are often small streams with cool waters because of shade and recently melted ice or snow. They may also be glacial headwaters, waters formed by the melting of glacial ice.

Headwater areas are the upstream areas of a watershed, as opposed to the outflow or discharge of a watershed. The river source is often but not always on or quite near the edge of the watershed, or watershed divide. For example, the source of the Colorado River is at the Continental Divide separating the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean watersheds of North America.

===Example===
A river is considered a linear geographic feature, with only one mouth and one source.
For an example, the Mississippi River and Missouri River sources are officially defined as follows:
*, Length: , Source: 
*, Length: , Source: 

==Related usages==
The verb &quot;rise&quot; can be used to express the general region of a river&#x27;s source, and is often qualified with an adverbial expression of place. For example:
*The River Thames rises in Gloucestershire.
*The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region of central Africa.

The word &quot;source&quot;, when applied to lakes rather than rivers or streams, refers to the lake&#x27;s inflow.

<text>Magic Adventures of Mumfie (full on-screen title: &quot;Britt Allcroft&#x27;s Magic Adventures of Mumfie&quot;) is a British animated children&#x27;s television series and movie, inspired by the &quot;Mumfie&quot; books written and illustrated by Katharine Tozer (1907–1943). The initial 1994 season of the series, spanning one continuous storyline, has a music score containing more than 20 songs. The series was created by Britt Allcroft (the creator of &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; and its US debut, &quot;Shining Time Station&quot;), produced by The Britt Allcroft Company, narrated by American actor Patrick Breen and directed by John Laurence Collins. &quot;Mumfie&quot; was first seen in the United States on the Fox Kids Network from 1995 to 1996, as part of &quot;The Fox Cubhouse&quot;. The second and third seasons debuted on the Fox Family Channel. 79 episodes were produced. The worldwide rights have reverted to Britt Allcroft.

==Episodes==

==Characters==
* Mumfie – The main character of the story, Mumfie is an elephant who lives in a little cottage in the woods. He always expects mail but never receives any. One day he decides to go on an adventure and the first thing he sees is a bird who asks if he can brighten up a dull tree.
* Scarecrow – When Mumfie first met Scarecrow, he was always in a field not ever moving until he set on the quest with him. Scarecrow is with Mumfie in all episodes.
* Pinkey the Flying Pig – Starting her first appearance in a farm where other pigs bully her, Pinkey is upset because she misses her mother so Scarecrow and Mumfie help her out.

* Bristle – At first a servant to the secretary Bristle is very strict about rules as he explains to Mumfie. When the secretary was defeated, he became loyal to the Queen of Night instead.
* Napoleon – Napoleon is the bird who is kept a prisoner by the secretary. He had his feathers cut off a long time ago and, believing he couldn&#x27;t fly anymore went into deep depression, until Pinkey made him understood after all these years they have grown back which persuades him to fly.
* The Queen of Night – The queen was the ruler of the island which Mumfie goes to. She is undercover as the secretary wants her jewel to rule all. She is voiced by Britt Allcroft instead of Breen due to his inability to speak in a female voice.
* Mr and Mrs Admiral – These two married people were having a dream of living an underwater house (despite the fact that humans can&#x27;t breathe underwater) until one day, when Mr Admiral was kidnapped by Davy Jones and his pirates which was a big blow to Mrs Admiral.
* Eel – Mumfie first met Eel in the cave that lead them to the pirates and Davy Jones because she was glowing in the dark.
* Davy Jones – Davy Jones is the leader of the pirates (who lived in their underwater ship) when he left he decided to be whale&#x27;s companion.
* Pirates – These pirates served Davy Jones when they kept Mr Admiral a prisoner until they became good guys.
* Youare the Reindeer – Youare is the reindeer character with twisted antlers whose first appearance was in &quot;Mumfie&#x27;s White Christmas&quot;. Despite the fact that &quot;You are?&quot; was a question that was asked to him in Santa&#x27;s stables, he assumed that was his name.

==Production==
Katharine Tozer&#x27;s original &quot;Mumfie&quot; novels are:
* The Wanderings of Mumfie (1935)
* Here Comes Mumfie (1936)
* Mumfie&#x27;s the Admiral (1937)
* Mumfie&#x27;s Magic Box (1938)
* Mumfie&#x27;s Uncle Samuel (1939)
* Mumfie&#x27;s Marches On (1942)

The books were first adapted for television as &quot;Here Comes Mumfie&quot;, a series using live-action puppetry, between 1975 and 1976 and broadcast on Independent Television (ITV) in the United Kingdom. Allcroft&#x27;s newly created version, with an original musical score featuring 26 Broadway style songs, was broadcast on the Children&#x27;s ITV block of UK&#x27;s ITV network in 1994 and has since been broadcast in other countries, including the United States (on Fox Kids and the Fox Family Channel), Canada, Australia, France, Scandinavia, Finland, Germany, Japan, and Israel.

The screen library consists of Series 1 (originally a 13x10 minute serial, later edited into the movie length epic story &quot;Mumfie&#x27;s Quest&quot;), the Holiday Special &quot;Mumfie&#x27;s White Christmas&quot; and Series 2 totaling 62 individual story episodes. In 1999, the show was placed under the Bridgefilms joint venture with Sooty International Limited. and remained as such as The Britt Allcroft Company rebranded as Gullane Entertainment in 2000 and the purchase by HIT Entertainment in 2002. HIT placed Bridgefilms up for sale in October 2007 and Britt Allcroft re-acquired the series in March 2008, Her family-owned business, Britt Allcroft Productions LLV, recently announced a home entertainment distribution deal for the Mumfie screen library with Lionsgate for the U.S., U.K, and many other parts of the world. They also had a partnership with United Talent Agency to handle all licensing for the Mumfie brand worldwide.

===Reboot===
In May 2014, Britt Allcroft stated that she had begun production on a reboot of &quot;Mumfie&quot;. In July 2015, it was revealed that the kids&#x27; division of Zodiak Entertainment, which was behind shows such as &quot;Zack &amp; Quack&quot; and &quot;Totally Spies!&quot;, had begun development of the show, with Britt Allcroft Productions.

In 2020, the series was announced to premiere in 2021, and would be animated by Italian animation studio Animoka. The series, which is now set on an island named Flutterstone, has new designs for pre-existing characters from the original series, giving them a more toy-like look as was the intention of the books (including Mumfie being shorter, with a smaller trunk and ears and actual hands and Pinky now having a flower near her left ear), as well as new characters such as a jellyfish named Jelly Bean (who, due to the new setting, replaces Scarecrow as a central character), a crocodile named King Kaleb (to whom the Black Cat is now the advisor of) and Boo Whale (a re-imagined version of Whale). In 2022, it was announced that the series had been pre-sold to many networks overseas, including the original broadcaster, ITV.

<doc id="415094" wikidata="Q950899" url="?curid=415094" title="Western Collegiate Hockey Association">
<text>The Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) is a college ice hockey conference which operates in the Midwestern United States. It participates in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I as a women&#x27;s-only conference.

From 1951 to 1999, it operated as a men-only league, adding women&#x27;s competition in the 1999–2000 season. It operated men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s leagues through the 2020–21 season; during this period, the men&#x27;s WCHA expanded to include teams far removed from its traditional Midwestern base, with members in Alabama, Alaska, and Colorado at different times. The men&#x27;s side of the league officially disbanded after seven members left to form the revived Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA); the WCHA remains in operation as a women-only league.

WCHA member teams won a record 38 men&#x27;s NCAA hockey championships, most recently in 2011 by the Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs. A WCHA team also finished as the national runner-up a total of 28 times. WCHA teams also won the first 13 NCAA women&#x27;s titles, which were first awarded in 2001.

==History==
The league was founded in 1951 as the Midwest Collegiate Hockey League (MCHL), then was known as the Western Intercollegiate Hockey League (WIHL) until 1958. The WIHL disbanded in 1958 after Minnesota and the three Michigan schools withdrew in protest of Colorado College, Denver and North Dakota recruiting overage Canadians. While this didn&#x27;t violate NCAA rules, the four &quot;M&quot; schools felt it violated the spirit of intercollegiate athletics. The current Western Collegiate Hockey Association was founded for the 1959–60 season after the former WIHL schools concluded that the region needed a strong league. Despite this, Denver and Minnesota would not play each other until 1973, when the league took over scheduling from the individual members. The 2005 NCAA Frozen Four hockey tournament finals were noteworthy when all four teams came from the WCHA.

WCHA teams also won the first 13 NCAA women&#x27;s titles, which were first awarded in 2001. In 2006, WCHA member Wisconsin was the first school to capture both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Division I ice hockey championships in the same season.

The men&#x27;s regular season conference champion was awarded the MacNaughton Cup, while the league&#x27;s tournament champion winning the WCHA Final Five took home the Broadmoor Trophy.

===2013 realignment===

On March 22, 2011, Minnesota and Wisconsin announced that their men&#x27;s teams planned to leave the league in order to form a hockey Big Ten Conference in 2013–14, along with Penn State, which would start a varsity hockey program in 2012–13, and Central Collegiate Hockey Association members Michigan, Michigan State, and Ohio State.

In response to the creation of the Big Ten men&#x27;s hockey conference, Denver, Colorado College, North Dakota, Nebraska-Omaha, Minnesota Duluth, and St. Cloud State left the WCHA to join Miami University and Western Michigan of the CCHA to create the National Collegiate Hockey Conference. Facing membership at 4 teams for the 2013–14 season, the WCHA conference added one of its former members, Northern Michigan of the CCHA, on July 15, 2011.

On August 25, 2011, the WCHA announced that it had invited the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Bowling Green, Ferris State, and Lake Superior State to join beginning in the 2013–14 season. On August 26, 2011, Alaska-Fairbanks, Ferris State, and Lake Superior State accepted their invitations and joined Northern Michigan in the WCHA in 2013. After much deliberation, on October 4, 2011, Bowling Green decided to join the WCHA as well in 2013. On January 17, 2013, the WCHA admitted Alabama–Huntsville to the league, effective in the 2013–14 season.

This realignment activity only affected the men&#x27;s side of the WCHA. Even after Penn State took the ice with both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams, the Big Ten still had only four members with varsity women&#x27;s hockey (Michigan and Michigan State field only men&#x27;s teams). This meant that the women&#x27;s side of the WCHA remained intact for the immediate future.

===After realignment===

The next change in the conference membership came shortly after the 2016–17 season, when North Dakota announced that it would drop women&#x27;s hockey.

During the 2019 offseason, the future of the men&#x27;s side of the WCHA fell into serious doubt when its seven Midwestern members—Bemidji State, Bowling Green, Ferris State, Lake Superior State, Michigan Tech, Minnesota State, and Northern Michigan—notified the WCHA that they would leave the league after the 2020–21 season, potentially forming a new men&#x27;s hockey conference. In February 2020, these seven schools announced they would form a new CCHA.

At the time the seven Midwestern members announced their plans to leave, the two Alaska teams were facing a crisis following the veto by state governor Mike Dunleavy of over $100 million in funding for the University of Alaska system, a move that was seen as potentially ending intercollegiate athletics entirely at both the Anchorage and Fairbanks campuses. The cuts led the UA system to start the process of consolidating the three-campus system into a single accredited institution (though retaining the existing campuses), with the system president telling local media that a single accreditation would likely lead to the Anchorage and Fairbanks athletic programs being combined into a single program. While both campuses continued to sponsor men&#x27;s ice hockey in the 2019–20 season, the future of at least one of the teams beyond that point was then seen as uncertain at best. Later developments saw many of the budget cuts pulled back, as well as a temporary halt to work on a single UA system accreditation; this led the UA system to announce that athletics at both campuses would continue as is through the 2020–21 school year.

In November 2019, Alabama–Huntsville submitted a withdrawal letter to the WCHA, stating that it also planned to leave after the 2020–21 season. At the time, UAH was discussing potential future options with the two Alaska campuses. However, UAH subsequently dropped hockey effective immediately on May 22, 2020, due to the financial impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic on its athletic department. On May 29, 2020, UAH President Darren Dawson announced that men&#x27;s hockey would return for the 2020–21 season after more than $750,000 in private contributions were made in the week prior. This reprieve proved temporary, as the school and its hockey supporters agreed that the continuation of the sport beyond 2020–21 would be contingent on finding a new conference home; when no conference move materialized, the hockey program was dropped again (although UAH officially called it a &quot;suspension&quot;).

In August 2020, Alaska Anchorage announced that it would drop hockey after the 2020–21 season. The University of Alaska Board of Regents offered the hockey team a chance at reinstatement in September if they could raise 2 seasons worth of expenses, approximately $3 million, by February 2021. The fundraising was divided into 2 parts: $1.5 million in cash, and the remainder in firm pledges. As of December 2020, the team had begun fundraising for the needed money. 

The men&#x27;s WCHA would fold after the 2020–21 season, but the women&#x27;s WCHA announced a further expansion effective in 2021–22 with the arrival of St. Thomas, a Twin Cities school that received NCAA approval to directly transition from Division III to Division I. St. Thomas had been expelled from its longtime D-III home of the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference effective with the end of the 2020–21 school year due to perceptions by many members that it had grown too strong for that conference in multiple sports. The Summit League offered the Tommies a D-I home, and backed the school&#x27;s bid to directly transition from D-III.

==Members==
The now women-only WCHA has 8 members following the 2021 arrival of St. Thomas. The men&#x27;s side of the conference had 10 members in its final season of 2020–21, at which time only two schools, Bemidji State and Minnesota State, had both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams in the conference.

==Awards (men&#x27;s)==
At the conclusion of each regular season schedule the coaches of each WCHA team vote which players they choose to be on the two to four All-Conference teams: first team and second team with a rookie team added in 1990–91 and a third team added in 1995–96. Additionally they vote to award up to 5 individual trophies to an eligible player at the same time. The WCHA also awards a Most Valuable Player in Tournament, which is voted on at the conclusion of the conference tournament. Only the Coach of the Year award has been bestowed in each year of the WCHA&#x27;s existence, making it the oldest continually-awarded conference award in Division I ice hockey.

<doc id="415095" wikidata="Q337943" url="?curid=415095" title="Bob Wareing">
<text>Robert Nelson Wareing (20 August 1930 – 1 May 2015) was a British politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Liverpool West Derby from 1983 to 2010. Until 2007, he was a Labour MP but resigned the party whip following his deselection as the party&#x27;s candidate for his constituency.

==Early life==
Wareing was born in Liverpool and attended Ranworth Square Council School (now Ranworth Square Primary School) in Norris Green, then Alsop High School in Liverpool. He gained an external BSc degree in Economics from the University of London in 1956 and a teacher&#x27;s certificate from Bolton College of Education (now part of the University of Bolton) the following year.

He was a local government officer for Liverpool Corporation from 1946 to 1948 and from 1950 to 1956. He was a lecturer at Brooklyn Technical College in Great Barr from 1957 to 1959, at Wigan and District Mining and Technical College from 1959 to 1963, at Liverpool College of Commerce on Tithebarn Street from 1963 to 1965, at Liverpool City Institute of Further Education from 1964 to 1972, and at the Central Liverpool College of Further Education from 1972 to 1983 as Deputy Head of Adult Education. Wareing replaced Eric Heffer as the councillor for the Pirrie ward in Walton constituency. He represented the ward for 19 years.

==Parliamentary career==
Wareing was first elected to the House of Commons at the 1983 general election, having previously stood (unsuccessfully) in Liverpool Edge Hill at the by-election in March 1979 and at the 1979 general election. He also contested Berwick upon Tweed in 1970.

Wareing spoke during a House of Commons debate on Bosnia on 29 April 1993. He objected to the recognition in 1992 of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the British government: &quot;People have been talking about the Bosnians as a nation. There is no nationality of Bosnian. They are Serbs, Croats and Muslims. Even the Muslims are Serbs&quot;. His statements on the subject were contrary to historical fact, according to Mladen Grbin.

Wareing, who was Chairman of the All-Party British-Yugoslav Parliamentary Group from 1994, held talks in 1995 with the Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadžić and General Ratko Mladić. Wareing told neither his constituency party, nor the Labour Party nationally about his intention to meet Karadžić, who was then wanted for war crimes, during his visit to the Serb controlled areas of Bosnia. Wareing, who was accompanied by the Conservative peer Lord Harlech, was not directly criticised at the time by Tony Blair, the Labour leader, although Blair&#x27;s spokesman did distance him from Wareing.

In June 1997, Wareing was suspended from membership of the Labour Party on suspicion of breaking the rules governing MP&#x27;s lobbying. In July 1997, the House of Commons Select Committee on Standards and Privileges reprimanded and suspended Wareing from the Commons for a week over the non-declaration of the interests of his consultancy firm. He was found to have received illicit funds as a lobbyist from Serbian firms.

Nicknamed &quot;Serbian Bob&quot; or the &quot;member for Belgrade&quot; as a result of his pro-Serb views, he was one of the few Labour MPs to vote against the NATO intervention over Kosovo in 1999. Wareing was a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, and frequently rebelled against the government. On 31 October 2006, Wareing was one of 12 Labour MPs to back Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party&#x27;s call for an inquiry into the Iraq War.

In August 2007, Wareing failed to gain sufficient support from Labour Party and trade union members in his constituency party to avoid facing a re-selection challenge as the Labour candidate for the next general election. On 16 September 2007, Wareing was defeated in a selection contest by Stephen Twigg, a former MP. Wareing denounced his de-selection as the work of a &quot;New Labour Mafia&quot;, announcing his intention to seek re-election as an independent, and resigned the Labour whip. However, on 4 March 2010, Wareing announced he would not be standing at the general election.

According to a report in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; in February 2010, using newly disclosed parliamentary records, from April 2004 to July 2009, Wareing booked House of Commons dining facilities on 28 occasions for the hosting of Russian businessmen on behalf of the Leading Ventures Associates, or affiliated enterprises; the LVA course in total costing the businessmen £4,000 each.

==Personal life==
He married Betty Coward (born July 1929) on 16 August 1962. She died in March 1989 in Lambeth.

Wareing died on 1 May 2015 at the age of 84. He had been admitted to hospital in London with a chest infection.

==BBC Heir Hunters==
On 29 February 2016 Bob Wareing featured on the BBC television programme &quot;Heir Hunters&quot;, a series that follows probate researchers tracking down heirs to unclaimed deceased estates. Since Bob&#x27;s wife died in 1989 and the couple had no children, there were no immediate heirs to his estate. The programme followed probate research company Fraser and Fraser&#x27;s research into Bob Wareing&#x27;s family tree in an attempt to find heirs. It also featured people who knew Bob during his life, including the then Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn. In the end the research company was able to locate 53 beneficiaries to Wareing&#x27;s estate.

<doc id="415098" wikidata="Q151113" url="?curid=415098" title="Billie Piper">
<text>Billie Paul Piper (born Leian Paul Piper; 22 September 1982) is an English actress and former singer. She initially gained recognition as a singer after releasing her debut single &quot;Because We Want To&quot; at age 15, which made her the youngest female singer to enter the UK Singles Chart at number one. Her follow-up single &quot;Girlfriend&quot; also entered at number one. In 1998, Piper released her debut studio album, &quot;Honey to the B,&quot; which was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Her second studio album, &quot;Walk of Life&quot;, was released in 2000 and spawned her third number-one single, &quot;Day &amp; Night&quot;. In 2003, Piper announced that she had ended her music career to focus on acting.

Piper appeared in the BBC One sci-fi series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as Rose Tyler, companion to the Doctor, as a regular between 2005 and 2006, and made guest appearances in 2008 and 2010. In 2013, she appeared in the series&#x27; 50th anniversary special as a separate character, though still credited as Rose Tyler. She starred as Belle de Jour in the drama series &quot;Secret Diary of a Call Girl&quot; (2007–2011), as Brona Croft/Lily in the Showtime horror series &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot; (2014–2016), and as Karen Mars in Netflix Original series &quot;Collateral&quot; (2018), for which she was nominated for a British Academy Television Award for Best Supporting Actress. Piper co-created and starred in the Sky Atlantic series &quot;I Hate Suzie&quot; (2020–2022), for which she earned a BAFTA nomination for Best Actress in 2021 and 2023.

Piper has starred in five plays since 2007 and won the 2017 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role in a Play for her performance in &quot;Yerma&quot;, described as a &quot;generation&#x27;s best&quot;.

==Early life and education ==
Piper was born in Swindon, Wiltshire, on 22 September 1982. She was initially named Leian Paul Piper, but her first name was legally changed to Billie on 25 April 1983 by her parents, Mandy Kent and Paul Piper. She has three siblings. Piper started dance classes aged five. Two years later, she appeared in soft-drink commercials for American TV before taking a role as an extra in the 1996 film &quot;Evita&quot;. She attended Bradon Forest School in Purton, near Swindon, but left at around the age of 12 after winning a scholarship to the Sylvia Young Theatre School in London.

==Career==

=== Music career ===
Piper&#x27;s career began when she was selected to appear on the Saturday morning children&#x27;s television show &quot;Scratchy &amp; Co.&quot; She later landed a role in a television commercial promoting the pop magazine &quot;Smash Hits&quot;. She was offered a record deal at the age of 15, and in 1998, became the youngest artist to debut at number one in the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Because We Want To&quot;, released under the stage mononym &quot;Billie&quot;. Her follow-up single &quot;Girlfriend&quot; also debuted at number one.

Piper&#x27;s debut album &quot;Honey to the B&quot; was released immediately afterwards, and entered and peaked at number 14 on the UK Albums Chart, selling more than 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom alone along with a platinum certification, and a double-platinum certification in New Zealand, where it peaked at number three on the New Zealand Albums Chart. However, &quot;Honey to the B&quot; found limited success in other territories, such as Australia, where it entered and peaked at number 31 on the ARIA Albums Chart despite the success of &quot;Honey to the Bee&quot;, and in the US it went almost completely unnoticed, peaking at number 17 on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart.

At the 1998 &quot;Smash Hits&quot; Poll Winners&#x27; party, Piper was nominated for Best New Act (for which she came second, it being won by B*Witched) and won Princess of Pop (she was the first to win this award). She then released &quot;She Wants You&quot; as the third single from the album. The song reached number three. &quot;Honey to the Bee&quot; was released as the fourth single from the album; like the previous single, it reached number three. At the same time, &quot;She Wants You&quot; was released in the US, reaching number 9 on the &quot;Hot Club Dance Play&quot; chart.

In 1999, Piper was nominated for two BRIT Awards and won two awards at the 1999 &quot;Smash Hits&quot; Poll Winners&#x27; party, although she was reduced to tears at the latter ceremony after being booed by fans of Ritchie Neville, whom she was dating at the time. She then started to tour and release in Asia. The singles and the album were released in mid- to late 1999. In August of that year, the follow-up to &quot;Because We Want To&quot; was released in Japan, a single comprising &quot;Girlfriend&quot; and &quot;She Wants You&quot; combined. She recorded a song for &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot; titled &quot;Makin&#x27; My Way (Any Way That I Can)&quot;.
During that time, Piper recorded her second album. She decided to release further records under her full name of Billie Piper. She returned to the Singles Chart in May 2000 with her third number-one single &quot;Day &amp; Night&quot;. She waited until September to release &quot;Something Deep Inside&quot;, which reached number four, but her success waned. In October 2000, Piper released her second album, &quot;Walk of Life&quot;, which reached No. 14 in the UK Album Chart, but quickly fell off the charts and was certified silver in the UK. The album charted in two other countries: New Zealand, where it reached No. 17, and Australia, where it peaked at No. 23. In Piper&#x27;s autobiography, she states that the album was a &quot;commercial bomb&quot;. The song &quot;Walk of Life&quot;, the final single off the album, was released in December 2000 and reached No. 25 in the UK Singles Chart.

In February 2001, Piper appeared in court to testify against a woman named Juliet Peters. Peters was charged with, and eventually convicted of, stalking as well as making numerous threats against Piper and members of her family. Peters received psychiatric treatment as part of her sentence. According to her autobiography, Piper was reluctant about the court case, but was pushed by her parents and her label. She also stated in the book that this was why &quot;The Tide Is High&quot; was not released as a single, writing: &quot;The court case succeeded in doing what I alone could not cutting the ties. Without it I might have been tempted back.&quot;

In January 2007, BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles started a campaign to get &quot;Honey to the Bee&quot; back into the top 100 on download sales as a way of testing out new chart rules that favour download sales. The campaign was successful, with &quot;Honey to the Bee&quot; re-entering the official UK singles chart at No. 17, eight years after it was first released.

===Film and television performances===
In 2004, Piper appeared in the films &quot;The Calcium Kid&quot; and &quot;Things to Do Before You&#x27;re 30&quot;. Shortly before starting work on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, she had a starring role in the horror film &quot;Spirit Trap&quot;, released in August 2005 to poor reviews. In November 2005, she starred as Hero in a BBC adaptation of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, updated for the modern day in a similar manner to the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; (2003) series in which she featured, with Hero now being a weather presenter in a television station.

In 2005, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was resurrected after a sixteen-year absence from TV. Piper was cast as Rose Tyler, a travelling companion to the ninth incarnation of The Doctor (played by Christopher Eccleston). Piper won the Most Popular Actress category at the 2005 and 2006 National Television Awards for her work on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. BBC News named her one of its &quot;Faces of the Year&quot; for 2005, primarily due to her success in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. At &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; Awards in January 2006, she was awarded &quot;The Times&quot; Breakthrough Award for her successful transition from singing to acting. In March, the Television and Radio Industries Club named her as the best new TV talent at their annual awards ceremony. In September, she was named Best Actress at the TV Quick and TV Choice Awards.

After the completion of the very successful first series of the revamped &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the British media regularly released conflicting reports about how long Piper would be staying with the show. In March 2006, she claimed that she would continue on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; into its third series in 2007. In May, however, she was reported to be considering quitting the series, although she did express an interest in playing a female version of the Doctor in the future (possibly related to a proposed &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off series about Rose, which was later dropped). In June, the BBC announced that she was to depart in &quot;Doomsday&quot; (2006), the final episode of the second series. Her decision to leave had been made a year previously, but had not yet been made public.

Piper starred as Hannah Baxter in &quot;Secret Diary of a Call Girl&quot; (2007–2012), an ITV2 adaptation of Brooke Magnanti&#x27;s &quot;The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl&quot;, a memoir detailing the life of a high-class prostitute who adopted &quot;Belle de Jour&quot; as her pseudonym, which aired from September 2007. As part of her preparation for the role, Piper met the memoir&#x27;s author two years before her identity as a research scientist was revealed in a Sunday newspaper: &quot;I absolutely had to meet the person behind the words to be able to take the part... people did ask me about her and I just had to smile, to avoid giving anything away.&quot;In November 2007, the BBC confirmed that she would reprise her role as Rose Tyler in the fourth series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; for three episodes. Later, it was confirmed by Russell T Davies in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; that this return had been planned since she left. The series began in April 2008, and after several cameos, Piper made her official return as Rose in the series four final episodes &quot;Turn Left&quot;, &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot;, and &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;. She did not initially state whether she would be reprising the role again. Interviewed on &quot;Doctor Who Confidential&quot;, she commented that &quot;it&#x27;s never really the end for the Doctor and Rose, but it&#x27;s certainly the end for the foreseeable future&quot;.

Piper completed work on two stand-alone television productions. In the first, a BBC adaptation of Philip Pullman&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Ruby in the Smoke&quot; which was broadcast in December 2006, she played protagonist Sally Lockhart, a Victorian orphan. The BBC planned to film all four of Pullman&#x27;s Sally Lockhart novels, with Piper continuing in the role in &quot;The Shadow in the North&quot;, which was shown in December 2007. Piper also appeared as Fanny Price in an adaptation of Jane Austen&#x27;s novel &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, screened on ITV1 in March 2007. This was her first acting role on television for a broadcaster other than the BBC. She then provided voice-overs for various television commercials, including one for Comfort fabric-softener airing in June 2007.

The second series of &quot;Secret Diary of a Call Girl&quot;, with Piper again in the starring role, started filming in May 2008, during which a body double was hired to hide Piper&#x27;s pregnancy during the sex scenes. Piper was also quoted during this time as worrying that she may have &quot;ruined her future career&quot; due to the nature of the topless scenes and other sexual scenes required. The third series began airing in January 2010. For the third and fourth series Piper was credited as executive producer. In January 2010, tying in with the broadcast of the third series and following on from the real Belle de Jour confirming her real identity, ITV2 broadcast an interview special, &quot;Billie and the Real Belle Bare All&quot;, which saw Piper meeting with Dr Brooke Magnanti on camera for the first time.

She reprised her role as Rose Tyler in &quot;The End of Time&quot;, the last of the 2008–2010 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; specials, as a younger version of Rose Tyler (specifically 3 months before her initial meeting with the Ninth Doctor in 2005 episode &quot;Rose&quot;). She also shared the role of Betty with Sue Johnston in the two-part TV adaptation of &quot;A Passionate Woman&quot;, screened on BBC 1 in April 2010. In May 2011, it was announced that Piper would join the cast of a romance-comedy film directed by Robin Sheppard titled &quot;Truth about Lies&quot;. In January 2013, Piper stated on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; that she had not been asked to return for the 50th anniversary of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, however, the BBC announced in the following March that she would be returning in the special, titled &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, which was broadcast in November 2013. Despite being credited as Rose Tyler, Piper&#x27;s actual role in the episode is the consciousness of &quot;The Moment&quot;, a sentient weapon which takes on the form of Rose&#x27;s &quot;Bad Wolf&quot; personality.

On 11 May 2014, Showtime aired a new horror series called &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot; in which Piper plays Brona Croft, a poor Irish immigrant who is trying to escape a dark past. In the show&#x27;s second series, Brona is resurrected by Victor Frankenstein as &quot;Lily&quot;. She was nominated for Best TV Supporting Actress at the 2015 Fangoria Chainsaw Awards. The show was renewed for a third and final series, which she began filming on 17 September 2015.

Piper returned to the role of Rose Tyler alongside David Tennant in three stories that form the second volume of &quot;The Tenth Doctor Adventures&quot; audio drama series from Big Finish Productions. One story also featured Camille Coduri reprising her role as Rose&#x27;s mother Jackie Tyler. The set was released in November 2017. It was later announced that Piper would be headlining her own audio drama titled &quot;Rose Tyler: The Dimension Cannon&quot;. The box set featured four stories with Rose Tyler alongside her parents Jackie (Coduri) and Pete Tyler (Shaun Dingwall) as well as featuring Clive from the episode &quot;Rose&quot;, played by his original actor Mark Benton. The first volume was released in September 2019 with two more expected in October 2022 and September 2023.

In 2019, Piper wrote, starred in and made her directorial debut with the &quot;anti-romcom&quot; &quot;Rare Beasts&quot;, before appearing alongside Sally Hawkins, Alice Lowe, and David Thewlis in &quot;Eternal Beauty&quot;, directed by Craig Roberts. The following year, in August 2020, Piper co-created and starred in the critically acclaimed Sky Atlantic series &quot;I Hate Suzie&quot;. The series was also co-created and written by &quot;Secret Diary of a Call Girl&quot; creator Lucy Prebble. Piper portrays the titular Suzie Pickles, a former child screen star whose life and career are turned upside down by a compromising phone hack. Critics noted her own experience of having been a prodigious young singer-turned-actress who becomes famous at a young age would have informed her role as Pickles. &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave it a five-star review, describing Piper&#x27;s character as &quot;nude, lewd and joyously off the rails&quot; in &quot;this scabrously funny drama&quot;.

In March 2021, it was announced that Piper would appear in the film adaptation of a children&#x27;s book called &quot;Catherine Called Birdy&quot;. In February 2023, it was announced she would play Sam McAlister, the TV producer who secured &quot;Newsnight&quot;&#x27;s interview with Prince Andrew, in &quot;Scoop&quot;, a Netflix adaptation of McAlister&#x27;s book. On 7 May 2024, it was announced that Piper had joined the cast of &quot;Wednesday&quot; season two alongside Joanna Lumley and Christopher Lloyd; filming began that same month.

===Stage work===
Piper made her stage debut in a touring production of Christopher Hampton&#x27;s play &quot;Treats&quot;, which opened in early 2007 in Windsor, Berkshire. &quot;Treats&quot; was to have ended its tour in the West End, at the Garrick Theatre, starting in February 2007 with previews. The play officially closed in May.

Piper played Carly in the UK premiere of Neil LaBute&#x27;s play &quot;Reasons to Be Pretty&quot; at the Almeida Theatre, running from November 2011 to January 2012. It received critical acclaim from &quot;The Guardian,&quot; &quot;The Observer,&quot; &quot;London Evening Standard,&quot; &quot;Metro,&quot; &quot;The Times,&quot; &quot;The Telegraph,&quot; &quot;Time Out,&quot; &quot;The Arts Desk,&quot; &quot;Daily Express&quot; and &quot;The Financial Times&quot;, all of which rated the production with a minimum of four stars. BBC Radio 4 described Piper as &quot;fantastic, completely brilliant. Her performance is so convincing and moving, an absolutely terrific performance&quot;. The &quot;Jewish Chronicle&quot; hailed Piper&#x27;s performance as second to none, being the best of the night, and stating that &quot;no actor can cry more convincingly than Piper&quot;, giving the show four stars.

Piper made her National Theatre debut in &quot;The Effect&quot; by Lucy Prebble, which ran from November 2012 to February 2013. The play went on to become the most critically acclaimed show of the season and Piper was nominated for the &quot;WhatsOnStage&quot; Best Actress award for her work in &quot;The Effect&quot;. The play was also nominated for Best New Play and Best Set Designer. Due to success and demand, the show was extended for a further month and an online petition was started for the show to be added to the National Theatre&#x27;s Live Programming. In 2013, Piper was nominated for Best Actress at the Olivier Awards and Evening Standard Theatre Awards for &quot;The Effect&quot;. Piper also starred in &quot;Great Britain&quot; at the Royal National Theatre in 2014. On 29 May 2014, Piper appeared alongside Ben Whishaw in the &quot;Playhouse Presents&quot; television special &quot;Foxtrot.&quot;

In 2016, Piper starred in an adaptation of Federico García Lorca&#x27;s 1934 play &quot;Yerma&quot; at the Young Vic, written and directed by Simon Stone. Upon opening, the play received critical acclaim, mainly for Piper&#x27;s performance. She was described as &quot;earth-quaking&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;a generation&#x27;s greatest performance&quot; by &quot;The Stage&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; described her as &quot;shattering&quot; with the reviewer admitting he found himself &quot;still visibly shaking from its effects on the Tube home afterwards.&quot; &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; proclaimed, &quot;This is the performance to which [Piper&#x27;s] previous excellent appearances on stage have been leading. She&#x27;s one of those rare actresses who can be monumentally tragic and almost casually realistic at the same time.&quot; Conversely, &quot;The Arts Desk&quot; warned its readers that her performance was &quot;an utterly grueling, almost unbearable 100 minutes.&quot; Piper won all six of the available Best Actress awards for that one performance, making it one of the most acclaimed and awarded stage performances in British theatre history, and making her the only actor to have picked up all six Best Actress awards for a single performance, including the coveted Olivier Award.

On 31 August 2017, &quot;Yerma&quot; streamed live into more than 700 cinemas across the UK. Whilst ticket sales are yet to be confirmed, more than 100 cinemas confirmed they had sold out to capacity with many requesting encore copies. In an unprecedented event, after the live screening had finished, &#x27;#Yerma&#x27; trended on Twitter at number three, with some writers claiming Twitter had &#x27;gone into complete meltdown&#x27; over Piper&#x27;s performance. The play was streamed across the world from 21 September.

Piper reprised the performance in a limited run at New York&#x27;s Park Avenue Armory during March and April 2018, her New York stage debut. She once again received unanimous critical praise. The &quot;New York Times&quot; said Piper&#x27;s performance was &quot;an unconditional victory&quot; and &quot;blisteringly powerful&quot; awarding it five stars, whilst &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; found her &quot;simply staggering&quot; adding; &quot;When the actress appears at the curtain call, looking emotionally and physical exhausted, you find yourself relieved that she&#x27;s OK and concerned that she&#x27;ll have to do it all over again the next night.&quot; &quot;Time Out&quot; likened Piper to an &quot;angry beast&quot; warning that her &quot;astonishing&quot; performance inflicted psychological-like emotions on the audience. NBC&#x27;s Katie Englehart said, &quot;Piper is so devastating I almost vomited in my seat – that doesn&#x27;t sound like an endorsement but it is.&quot; &quot;Vogue&quot; hailed Piper as &quot;one of the great talents of her generation&quot; and described her performance as &quot;astonishing, raw, feral and terrifying.&quot; The AM New York critic claimed to be left &quot;gasping for air&quot; whilst the &quot;New York Stage Review&quot; found Piper&#x27;s &quot;downward spiral into abyss utterly harrowing and blazingly remarkable.&quot;

==Personal life==
Piper married television presenter Chris Evans in a secret ceremony at the Little Church of the West in Paradise, Nevada near Las Vegas on 6 May 2001 after six months of dating. Their marriage attracted much comment because Piper was 18 and Evans was 35. The couple separated in 2004, and divorced in May 2007.

Piper married actor Laurence Fox on 31 December 2007, at St Mary&#x27;s Church in Easebourne, West Sussex. They have two sons. Piper was granted a divorce in May 2016.

Piper began dating Johnny Lloyd, the frontman of Tribes, in 2016. Their daughter was born on 2 January 2019. The couple separated in 2023.

<text>The Hockey East Association, also known as Hockey East, is a college ice hockey conference which operates entirely in New England. It participates in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I as a hockey-only conference.

Hockey East came into existence in 1984 for men&#x27;s hockey when most of its current members split from what is today known as ECAC Hockey, after disagreements with the Ivy League members. The women&#x27;s league began play in 2002.

On October 5, 2011, the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish (an ACC member outside football) announced they would be joining Hockey East as the conference&#x27;s first non-New England school in 2013 after the CCHA folded. On March 22, 2016, Notre Dame subsequently announced their men&#x27;s hockey team would leave Hockey East for the Big Ten Conference at the start of the 2017–2018 season. The University of Connecticut (UConn) and Hockey East jointly announced on June 21, 2012, that UConn&#x27;s men&#x27;s team, then in Atlantic Hockey, would join the school&#x27;s women&#x27;s team in Hockey East in 2014. On October 24, 2013, Merrimack College, already a member of the Hockey East men&#x27;s league, announced that it would upgrade its women&#x27;s team from club level to full varsity status effective in 2015 and join the Hockey East women&#x27;s league.

On May 2, 2017, the College of the Holy Cross announced that it would join Hockey East for women&#x27;s hockey only starting in 2018–19.

==Members==
There are currently 12 member schools, with 11 participating in the men&#x27;s division and 10 in the women&#x27;s division.

The Hockey East Championship Game has been held in Boston since 1987. Originally held at the Boston Garden, it moved to TD Garden in 1996. Prior to moving to Boston, the first two men&#x27;s Hockey East championships were held in Providence, Rhode Island at the Providence Civic Center.

The semifinal and final games are held on consecutive nights in mid-March at TD Garden. The quarterfinal round takes place the previous weekend. The top eight teams in the league advance to the quarterfinal round, which is a best 2-out-of-3 series with all games played at the higher seed&#x27;s rink. There have been two cases where the #8 seed won on the #1 team&#x27;s ice.

===Women&#x27;s===

The Hockey East Championship was held in Boston from its inception in 2003 until 2007. The event was held at Northeastern&#x27;s Matthews Arena in 2003 and 2004 before moving to BU&#x27;s Walter Brown Arena in 2005. The tournament returned to Matthews Arena in 2006, was held at UNH&#x27;s Whittemore Center in 2007, and at UConn&#x27;s Mark Edward Freitas Ice Forum in 2008. The tournament went back to UNH in 2009, Providence in 2010, and the last campus to host was Boston University in 2011. The tournament moved to Hyannis, Massachusetts in 2012, and Lawler Arena on the Merrimack College campus in North Andover, Massachusetts in 2016.

==Rivalries==
Boston College, Boston University, and Northeastern all take part in the annual Beanpot tournament with Harvard of ECAC Hockey.

The previously existing rivalry between Boston College and Notre Dame, the Holy War on Ice, became a conference matchup with Notre Dame&#x27;s arrival in Hockey East. The two are rivals in other sports as well, as both are members of the Atlantic Coast Conference for most sports (though Notre Dame&#x27;s football team remains independent, they play BC in that sport on a regular basis). Maine also has a rivalry with New Hampshire, often called &quot;The Border War&quot;. Providence and UConn also have a rivalry which spills over from the basketball court.

==Conference arenas==

==Awards==
===Men&#x27;s===
At the conclusion of each regular season schedule the coaches of each Hockey East team vote which players they choose to be on the three All-Conference Teams: first team, second team and rookie team (except for 1985–86 when no rookie team was selected). Additionally they vote to award up to 6 individual trophies to an eligible player at the same time. Hockey East also awards a Conference Tournament Most Valuable Player and names a tournament all-star team, which are voted on at the conclusion of the conference tournament. Four of these awards have been bestowed every year that Hockey East has been in operation. In addition, the Scoring Champion and Goaltending Champions are named based solely on statistics the players made during the season.


===All-Conference Teams===

===Individual awards===

===Team Awards===

===Women&#x27;s===
The award for the top HEA player each year is the Cammi Granato Award, awarded since 2009. The NCAA Division I Women&#x27;s Ice Hockey Player of the year, the Patty Kazmaier Award, has been won by HEA players Brooke Whitney (Northeastern) in 2002, Alex Carpenter (Boston College) in 2015, Kendall Coyne (Northeastern) in 2016, Daryl Watts (Boston College) in 2018, and Aerin Frankel (Northeastern) in 2021.

==Television rights==
Since the 2019–2020 season, Hockey East games have aired regionally on NESN and are available in the rest of the United States and in Canada on Paramount+ and SportsLive.

Games previously aired nationally on NBCSN through the 2016 Hockey East Championship game, and on American Sports Network prior to the service&#x27;s closure.

On April 6, 2022, Hockey East reached a six-year media rights agreement with ESPN and ESPN+ that will bring games to ESPN&#x27;s television and streaming platforms;

*300 games per season with all contests available on ESPN+.
*3 games per season that will air on ESPNU.

<text>Llewellyn Thomas Smith (16 April 1944 – 26 May 2021) was a British Labour Party politician.

==Early life and education==
According to Smith, his father was born in England and moved to Wales as a child. He began working at the local colliery (Newbridge) at the age of thirteen, and his brother died in a tragic accident while also working there. Smith&#x27;s father eventually died of cancer and pneumoconiosis, a group of diseases typically associated with mineworkers.

Smith was educated at Coleg Harlech as an adult, referring to himself as a &quot;second chance&quot; student. Before becoming a politician, he worked as a labourer and computer operator.

==Political career==
Smith was Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for South Wales East from 1984 to 1994, being re-elected in the 1989 European election. While in this position, he worked with members like Alex Falconer, Stan Newens, and Alf Lomas to improve the democratic accountability of the parliament.

At the 1992 general election he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Blaenau Gwent, succeeding former Labour leader Michael Foot. He was a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, and defied various government whips. He opposed the private finance initiative, the creation of nuclear weapons, and Tony Blair&#x27;s stance on the Iraq War.

Smith became known for his opposition to devolution and the formation of the National Assembly for Wales; in May 1997, Welsh Secretary Ron Davies threatened disciplinary action against Welsh Labour MPs who planned to campaign against a Welsh Assembly in the devolution referendum. Smith was a specific focus of this move, having various party meetings about his views and being threatened by Davies and his policy adviser with expulsion if he chose to act on them. A public row ensued in which Davies was pushed to say that those who reasonably opposed devolution, including Smith, would not be removed from the party. After this, Smith stepped back from his complaint to the standards and privileges committee, but did not withdraw it. Following the creation of the Assembly, he continued to vote against giving it further powers and funding, and led a campaign to change its voting from a proportional list system.

In the 2001 general election, Smith won Blaenau Gwent with 61% of the vote, beating the Plaid Cymru candidate by 19,313 votes. In 2002, he was one of several MPs to express support for the Labour Against the Euro group, which opposed the UK&#x27;s possible membership of the single currency.

In December 2002, Smith made an early announcement that he would be standing down as an MP, so a suitable candidate could be found for the next general election. Later, the Blairite Maggie Jones was chosen to succeed him in an all-woman shortlist. Smith opposed this move as it took the choice of representation out of the hands of constituents, and instead suggested that Assembly Member Peter Law would win in the 2005 general election should he go against Jones, calling him a &quot;popular and effective representative&quot;. This prediction came true when Law stood as an Independent, becoming the MP for Blaenau Gwent for the year up until his death. Twenty party members were expelled for openly supporting Law, but Smith remained within the party due to not openly voicing any support.

Following Law&#x27;s death from a brain tumour in 2006, the seat was won by Dai Davies, who had previously been Smith&#x27;s agent.

==Other work==
In 2010, an exhibition was put on by Smith and his late wife at Manchester&#x27;s People&#x27;s History Museum, entitled &quot;Politics, Protest and the Christmas Card&quot;. It told the history of left-wing politics through the medium of the Christmas card. Following this, in 2012 he published &quot;Glad Tidings of Struggle and Strife&quot; with his wife as co-author, showing a selection of the cards.

==Personal life==
Smith and his wife Pam (who died in 2008) had two sons, Matthew and Benjamin, and a daughter, Eleanor.

He died from cancer on 26 May 2021 at the age of 77.

<doc id="415103" wikidata="Q1263846" url="?curid=415103" title="Elliott Abrams">
<text>Elliott Abrams (born January 24, 1948) is an American politician and lawyer, who has served in foreign policy positions for presidents Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump. Abrams is considered to be a neoconservative. He was a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. He served as the U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela from 2019 to 2021 and as the U.S. Special Representative for Iran from 2020 to 2021.

His involvement in the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration led to his conviction in 1991 on two misdemeanor counts of unlawfully withholding information from Congress. He was later pardoned by president George H. W. Bush.

During George W. Bush&#x27;s first term, he served as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director on the National Security Council for Near East and North African Affairs. At the start of Bush&#x27;s second term, Abrams was promoted to be his Deputy National Security Advisor for Global Democracy Strategy, in charge of promoting Bush&#x27;s strategy of &quot;advancing democracy abroad.&quot; In the Bush administration, Abrams was a supporter of the Iraq War. Abrams led the 1998 Project for the New American Century (PNAC) letter demanding the removal of Saddam Hussein as a primary policy goal.

During Donald Trump&#x27;s term, on January 25, 2019, he was appointed by Mike Pompeo as Special Representative for Venezuela. On September 1, 2020, he was further appointed to concurrently serve as the U.S. Special Representative for Iran.

On July 3, 2023, he was appointed by President Joe Biden to the non-partisan U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy.

== Background ==
Elliott Abrams was born into a Jewish family in New York in 1948. His father was an immigration lawyer. Abrams attended the Little Red School House in New York City, a private high school whose students at the time included the children of many of the city&#x27;s notable left-wing activists and artists. Abrams&#x27; parents were Democrats. His first cousin is attorney Floyd Abrams.

Abrams received his Bachelor of Arts from Harvard College in 1969, a Master of Science in international relations from the London School of Economics in 1970, and his Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School in 1973. He practiced law in New York in the summers for his father, and then at Breed, Abbott &amp; Morgan from 1973 to 1975 and with Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand from 1979 to 1981.

Abrams worked as an assistant counsel on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in 1975, then worked as a staffer on Senator Henry &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson&#x27;s brief campaign for the 1976 Democratic Party presidential nomination. From 1977 through 1979, he served as special counsel and ultimately as chief of staff for the then-new senator Daniel Moynihan.

Dissatisfaction with President Carter&#x27;s foreign policy led Abrams to campaign for Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.

==Career==
===Assistant Secretary of State, 1980s===
Abrams first came to national prominence when he served as Reagan&#x27;s Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs in the early 1980s and later as Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs. His nomination to Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs was unanimously approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on November 17, 1981. Abrams was Reagan&#x27;s second choice for the position; his first nominee, Ernest W. Lefever, had been rejected by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on June 5, 1981.

During his time in the post, Abrams clashed regularly with church groups and human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch. According to an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, in a 1984 appearance on the program &quot;Nightline&quot;, Abrams clashed with Aryeh Neier, the executive director of Human Rights Watch and with the leader of Amnesty International, over the Reagan administration&#x27;s foreign policies. They accused him of covering up atrocities committed by the military forces of U.S.-backed governments, including those in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, and the rebel Contras in Nicaragua. Abrams accused critics of the Reagan administration&#x27;s foreign policy towards Latin America of being &quot;Un-American&quot; and &quot;unpatriotic.&quot;

In an October 1981 memo, weeks prior to his confirmation in the Senate, Abrams asserted, &quot;human rights is at the core of our foreign policy.&quot; Critics say that Abrams and the Reagan administration misappropriated the term human rights, with Tamar Jacoby writing in 1986, &quot;in a period that more or less coincided with Abrams&#x27; tenure as assistant secretary of state for human rights, the White House endeavored to appropriate the banner of human rights for itself to use it in battle not only against communist regimes but also, in a more defensive way, against domestic opponents of its human rights policy.&quot; The Lawyers Committee, Americas Watch and Helsinki Watch wrote a report in 1985, charging that Abrams had &quot;developed and articulated a human rights ideology which complements and justifies Administration policies&quot; and undermined the purpose of the human rights bureau in the State Department.

According to American University political scientist William M. LeoGrande, Communist governments were the worst human rights violators in the world, Abrams believed, so virtually anything done to prevent Communists from coming to power (or to overthrow them) was justifiable on human rights grounds. This theory fit neatly into the Cold War presumptions that framed Reagan&#x27;s foreign policy and allowed the administration to rationalize supporting murderous regimes so long as they were anti-Communists. In practice, it was little different from Henry Kissinger&#x27;s realpolitik that discounted human rights issues entirely. Abrams was generally considered a skilled and influential bureaucrat in the human rights bureau.

==== Guatemala ====
As Assistant Secretary of State, Abrams advocated for aid to Guatemala under then dictator Efraín Ríos Montt, erroneously stating in 1983 that his reign had &quot;brought considerable progress&quot; on human rights. Ríos Montt came to power via a coup in 1982, overcoming the forces of General Fernando Romeo Lucas García. Thirty years later, Ríos Montt was found guilty of overseeing a campaign of mass murder and torture of indigenous people, genocide, in Guatemala. Ríos Montt, who claimed he had no operational control of the forces involved, was convicted of genocide against the Maya-Ixil population.

==== El Salvador ====
Abrams frequently defended the human rights record of the El Salvador government and attacked human rights groups as communist sympathizers when they criticized the El Salvador government. In early 1982, when reports of the El Mozote massacre of hundreds of civilians by the military in El Salvador began appearing in U.S. media, Abrams told a Senate committee that the reported number of deaths at El Mozote &quot;was not credible,&quot; reasoning that the reported number of deaths was greater than the likely population, and that there were survivors. He said that &quot;it appears to be an incident that is at least being significantly misused, at the very best, by the guerrillas.&quot; The massacre had come at a time when the Reagan administration was attempting to bolster the human rights image of the Salvadoran military. Abrams implied that reports of a massacre were simply FMLN propaganda and denounced U.S. investigative reports of the massacre as misleading. In March 1993, the Salvadoran Truth Commission reported that over 500 civilians were &quot;deliberately and systematically&quot; executed in El Mozote in December 1981 by forces affiliated with the Salvadoran government. A 1992 Human Rights Watch report criticized Abrams for downplaying the massacre.

Also in 1993, documentation emerged suggesting that some Reagan administration officials could have known about El Mozote and other human rights violations from the beginning. However, in July 1993, an investigation commissioned by Clinton Secretary of State Warren Christopher into the State Department&#x27;s &quot;activities and conduct&quot; with regard to human rights in El Salvador during the Reagan years found that, despite U.S. funding of the Salvadoran government that committed the massacre at El Mozote, individual U.S. personnel &quot;performed creditably and occasionally with personal bravery in advancing human rights in El Salvador.&quot; Abrams said in 2001 that Washington&#x27;s policy in El Salvador was a &quot;fabulous achievement.&quot; In 2019 he said that the &quot;fabulous achievement&quot; was that El Salvador &quot;has been a democracy&quot;. In a 1998 interview, Abrams remarked, &quot;While it was important to us to promote the cause of human rights in Central America it was more important to prevent a communist takeover in El Salvador.&quot;

====Nicaragua====

When Congress shut down funding for the Contras&#x27; efforts to overthrow Nicaragua&#x27;s Sandinista government with the 1982 Boland Amendment, members of the Reagan administration began looking for other avenues for funding the group. Congress opened a couple of such avenues when it modified the Boland Amendment for fiscal year 1986 by approving $27 million in direct aid to the Contras and allowing the administration to legally solicit funds for the Contras from foreign governments. Neither the direct aid, nor any foreign contributions, could be used to purchase weapons.

Guided by the new provisions of the modified Boland Amendment, Abrams flew to London in August 1986 and met secretly with Bruneian defense minister General Ibnu to solicit a $10-million contribution from the Sultan of Brunei. Ultimately, the Contras never received this money because a clerical error in Oliver North&#x27;s office (a mistyped account number) sent the Bruneian money to the wrong Swiss bank account.

=== Iran-Contra affair and convictions ===

In October 1986, a plane flown by Eugene Hasenfus, carrying military equipment intended for the Contras, a right-wing rebel group fighting against the socialist Sandinista government of Nicaragua, was shot down over Nicaragua. The Reagan administration publicly denied that Hasenfus sought to arm the Contras as part of a US government mission. However, the State Department was centrally involved in the covert plan to fund the Contras, which violated congressional legislation. In congressional testimony in October 1986, Abrams repeatedly and categorically denied that the US government was involved in arming the Contras. However, at the time, Abrams knew that &quot;[Oliver] North was encouraging, coordinating and directing the activities of the contra-resupply operation and that North was in contact with the private citizens who were behind the lethal resupply fights.&quot;

During investigation of the Iran-Contra Affair, Lawrence Walsh, the Independent Counsel tasked with investigating the case, prepared multiple felony counts against Abrams. In 1991, Abrams admitted that he knew more than he acknowledged in his congressional testimony, cooperated with Walsh and entered into a plea agreement in which he pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of withholding information from Congress. For failing to cooperate, he would have faced felony charges of perjury over his congressional testimony. He was sentenced to a $50 fine, probation for two years, and 100 hours of community service. Abrams was pardoned by President George H. W. Bush in December 1992.

In 1997, Abrams was publicly sanctioned by the District of Columbia Bar for giving false testimony to Congress about the Iran-Contra affair. Although several of the court&#x27;s judges recommended disbarment, the court ultimately declined to disbar Abrams over questions related to the effect of Abrams&#x27; presidential pardon for his prior criminal conduct.

=== Bush administration ===
President George W. Bush appointed Abrams to the post of Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Democracy, Human Rights, and International Operations at the National Security Council on June 25, 2001. Abrams was appointed special assistant to the President and the NSC&#x27;s senior director for Near East and North African Affairs on December 2, 2002.

Human rights groups and commentators expressed disquiet over his White House appointment owing to his disreputable conduct and conviction in the Iran–Contra affair investigation and his role in overseeing the Reagan administration&#x27;s foreign policy in Latin America.

&quot;The Observer&quot; wrote that Abrams had advance knowledge of, and &quot;gave a nod to,&quot; the Venezuelan coup attempt of 2002 against Hugo Chávez.

&quot;The Intercept&quot; has reported that Abrams had a key role in disrupting a peace plan proposed by Iran, right after the U.S. invasion to Iraq in 2003. Abrams&#x27; office received this plan by fax. They should have passed the plan to Condoleezza Rice. But she never saw it. Later, Abrams&#x27;s spokesperson was asked about the plan and he said “he had no memory of any such fax.”

On February 2, 2005, Bush appointed Abrams deputy national security adviser for Global Democracy Strategy, where he served until the end of his administration on January 20, 2009. Abrams accompanied Condoleezza Rice as a primary adviser on her visits to the Middle East in late July 2006 in the course of discussions relating to the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict.

=== Post-Bush administration ===
On May 16, 2016, Abrams wrote a historical piece in &quot;The&quot; &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; predicting that Donald Trump would &quot;fail colossally&quot; in the 2016 election to which he drew parallels with the 1972 election.

On December 23, 2016, Abrams, a strong supporter of Israel, criticized Barack Obama for &quot;undermining Israel&#x27;s elected government, prevent its action against Iran&#x27;s nuclear weapons program, and create as much daylight as possible between the United States and Israel.&quot; Abrams condemned Obama&#x27;s decision not to block a UN resolution criticizing Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories.

In February 2017, it was reported that Abrams was Secretary of State Rex Tillerson&#x27;s first pick for Deputy Secretary of State, but that Tillerson was overruled by Trump. Trump aides were supportive of Abrams, but Trump opposed him because of Abrams&#x27; opposition during the campaign.

Abrams is a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. Additionally, he holds positions on the Committee for Peace and Security in the Gulf (CPSG), Center for Security Policy &amp; National Secretary Advisory Council, Committee for a Free Lebanon, and the Project for the New American Century. He is a member of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council and maintained a CFR blog called &quot;Pressure Points&quot; about U.S. foreign policy and human rights.

He was on the faculty of Georgetown University.

=== Trump administration ===

On January 25, 2019, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appointed Abrams as the United States&#x27; Special Representative for Venezuela. This came two days after American recognition of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as president, thus advocating for regime change in Venezuela.

Abrams&#x27;s career and record on foreign policy was questioned by some opposition members in Congress. For example, in February 2019, Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota questioned whether Abrams was the correct choice for such a role because of his conviction of lying to Congress about his role in the Iran-Contra affair, and his historical support for previous instances of right-wing regime change in Central and South America in the 1970s and 1980s. Omar particularly criticized Abrams&#x27;s description of the Reagan administration&#x27;s &quot;record in El Salvador [as] one of fabulous achievement,&quot; in light of the El Mozote massacre, a mass killing of over 800 Salvadorian civilians carried out by US-backed and trained &quot;death squads.&quot;

Upon the resignation of Brian Hook, Abrams was selected to succeed him as United States Special Representative for Iran. Both positions were merged into the US Special Representative for Iran and Venezuela as of September 1, 2020.

=== Post-Trump administration ===
In 2021, Abrams founded a new group called the &quot;Vandenberg Coalition&quot;, named after Arthur Vandenberg, who helped build the foundations for NATO after World War II. The coalition involves Morgan Ortagus, a former State Department official, Randy Scheunemann, a neocon lobbist and former head of the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq, Doug Feith, a former Defense Department planner for the Iraq War, and Lewis “Scooter” Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney.

On 3 July 2023, Abrams was nominated to the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy by President Biden. He still needs to be confirmed by the Senate before serving on the commission.

Since the attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, his focus has been on supporting Israel&#x27;s war in Gaza, along with the need to extend the war to Iran, acclaiming it is one of the primary financial sponsors of Hamas. This is despite the fact that President Biden made it clear that there is “no clear evidence” that Iran was involved in the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel – a statement that the Iranian government has also strongly emphasized.

==Political views==
Abrams is neoconservative and was one of the Bush administration&#x27;s intellectual architects of the Iraq War. Abrams is also pro-Israel.

Abrams originally opposed Trump&#x27;s candidacy for president, writing an op-ed in &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; titled &quot;When You Can&#x27;t Stand Your Candidate.&quot; Abrams supported Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio during the Republican primaries for the 2016 presidential election. After his time working in the Trump administration, he confirmed that he has continued to believe that Donald Trump was unfit to be president. He agreed with Senator Mitch McConnell&#x27;s assessment that Trump provoked the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

Abrams gave his impressions of working personally with three different U.S. Presidents, and the differences between their presidential styles, in an interview in 2023.

==Personal life==

Through Senator Moynihan, Abrams was introduced to Rachel Decter, the stepdaughter of Moynihan&#x27;s friend Norman Podhoretz, editor of &quot;Commentary&quot;. They were married from 1980 until her death in June 2013. He has two sons and one daughter.

<doc id="415105" wikidata="Q334325" url="?curid=415105" title="Austin Mitchell">
<text>Austin Vernon Mitchell (19 September 1934 – 18 August 2021) was a British academic, journalist and Labour Party politician who was the member of Parliament (MP) for Great Grimsby from a 1977 by-election to 2015. He was also the chair of the Labour Euro-Safeguards Campaign. Before becoming an MP in the United Kingdom, Austin Mitchell was a well known television broadcaster in New Zealand.

==Early life and education==
Born in Bradford, Mitchell was the elder son of Richard Vernon Mitchell and Ethel Mary Butterworth. He was educated at Woodbottom Council School in Baildon, the Bingley Grammar School, the University of Manchester, and Nuffield College, Oxford. His doctoral thesis, &quot;The Whigs in Opposition, 1815–1830&quot;, was published in 1963.

== Career ==
=== Teaching ===
From 1959 to 1963, he lectured in history at the University of Otago in Dunedin. While lecturing in politics from 1963 to 1967 at the University of Canterbury, Mitchell wrote a popular book about New Zealand, &quot;The Half Gallon Quarter Acre Pavlova Paradise&quot; (1972). The book title became a phrase in the New Zealand English lexicon. In the 1960s and 70s New Zealand remained a milder version of the socialist laboratory it had been since 1935. In the 1980s and 90s the same socialist Labour party&#x27;s government transformed it into an open market economy. These drastic changes provided ample subject matter for social analysis and 30 years later Mitchell wrote &quot;Pavlova Paradise Revisited&quot; (2002) as well as a video series accessible on &quot;NZ on Screen&quot;, after another New Zealand expedition. From 1967 to 1969 Mitchell was an Official Fellow at Nuffield College.

Mitchell joined the New Zealand Labour Party in 1961 and several months later he became chairman of the Dunedin Central branch. In 1963 Phil Connolly, the retiring MP for Dunedin Central, shoulder-tapped Mitchell to put his name forward to replace him in the seat. During their conversation Connolly was particularly concerned with what religion Mitchell was (assuming him to be a Catholic) and was relieved when Mitchell said he was an Anglican, which would be acceptable to a predominantly Presbyterian constituency. However, Mitchell ultimately did not put himself forward for the nomination, instead resolving to return to the UK.

Mitchell was a founding member of New Zealand&#x27;s University of Canterbury Political Science Department in 1963, supporting it breaking away from the History Department. In 2015 he returned to the University of Canterbury as a Canterbury Visiting Fellow. Mitchell lectured on &quot;Britain and New Zealand - The Great Unravelling&quot;, looking at the evolution of recent British politics, drawing analogies in each section with parallel developments and implications for New Zealand to examine all worldwide trends in the evolution of liberal English-speaking democracies.

=== Journalism ===
He first became involved in television journalism while teaching history and politics in New Zealand in the 1960s. He fronted the current affairs show &quot;Compass&quot; and in 1965 conducted an interview series with leading politicians &quot;Men on the Hill&quot; in which he explored the balance of power among the institutions of modern government such as caucus, departments, cabinet, and parliament with an emphasis on the question of who governs?. In 1966 he hosted a fortnightly television series &quot;Topic&quot; exploring an issue of the day and also fronted one-off television programmes – for example &quot;The New Zealand woman – who is she.&quot; On returning to the UK he used his New Zealand television experience to become a journalist at ITV company Yorkshire Television from 1969 to 1977, presenting their regional news programme &quot;Calendar&quot;, although he spent a short period at the BBC in 1972. During his period at Yorkshire, Mitchell chaired a tense live studio discussion involving Brian Clough and Don Revie, immediately following Clough&#x27;s sacking by Leeds United in 1974.

===Politics===
He was elected to the UK Parliament at a by-election in 1977, following the death of the previous MP, the Foreign Secretary Tony Crosland. At the time Mitchell identified himself as a Gaitskellite.

Mitchell supported the introduction of television cameras to the House of Commons, raising it for discussion in 1983. The move opened the proceedings of the House to the wider public, who previously had only been able to follow via newspapers and, from 1978, radio. In 1986, following the John Stalker inquiry to alleged Royal Ulster Constabulary &quot;shoot-to-kill&quot; policies in Northern Ireland, a policeman Chief Inspector Brian Woollard claimed he had been removed from the inquiry by a group of Freemasons; Mitchell backed Woollard and argued that there should be a national register of all people in authority who are Freemasons.

In 1980, Mitchell brought in a Bill that would have televised parliamentary proceedings. The vote to allow the Bill to be entered into the House which resulted in a tie vote. Then Deputy Speaker Bernard Weatherill broke to tie to allow the Bill to be debated in line with the Speaker Denison&#x27;s rule.

Beginning in the 1990s, Mitchell helped to highlight Jersey&#x27;s role in facilitating tax evasion, drug trafficking, and money laundering, as well as the island&#x27;s secretive partnership with accountancy firms Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Young to enact LLP legislation to minimise accountants&#x27; liabilities.

In the 2001 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Mitchell was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to New Zealand interests in the United Kingdom.

In October 2002, he temporarily changed his name to Austin Haddock as haddock is a staple catch for his constituents that was suffering a decline and it was his wish to promote it.

He was chair of the Parliamentary All-Party Photography Group and he regularly exhibited in the APPG&#x27;s annual photography exhibition. He campaigned for the recognition of photographers&#x27; rights after an over-zealous police officer deleted photographs, without his permission, from his camera&#x27;s memory card at the 2005 Labour Conference in Brighton.

In 2007, Mitchell wrote a front-page article for &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper in which he criticised the treatment of a family of asylum-seekers in his constituency. This article quoted him as saying that certain correspondents on the subject to the website of the local newspaper, the &quot;Grimsby Telegraph&quot;, were &quot;lumpen lunatics.&quot; The &quot;Grimsby Telegraph&quot; covered the response in which it stood by the MP but also reported that a number of readers had called for his resignation.

He was a member of the Socialist Campaign Group – although this affiliation did not prevent him from nominating Gordon Brown (rather than John McDonnell) for the 2007 Labour Party leadership election. As a supporter of the Better Off Out campaign, Mitchell was a Eurosceptic and he opposed the Common Fisheries Policy. He supported Leave in the 2016 referendum on EU membership, and he commented that &#x27;the EU is a racket run at Britain&#x27;s expense, a system bonding national elites together to ignore the people&#x27;.

Mitchell was also a keen supporter of the Additional Member System, (the electoral system used in elections to the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly), and called a Private Members&#x27; Debate on this issue on 1 December 2009.

As part of an independent audit conducted after the United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal of 2009, in which expense claims between 2004 and 2008 for second homes were examined, Mitchell was discovered to have wrongly claimed £10,549 for mortgage repayments. He explained that this was as a result of an oversight in 2006; in January 2010, he issued an apology and repaid the funds.

During 2010, Mitchell participated in &quot;Tower Block of Commons&quot;, a Channel 4 documentary where MPs live in tower blocks and in with ordinary residents in deprived areas. Mitchell, who insisted on living in his own flat with his wife instead of living with the local residents, was criticised for his apparent lack of engagement in comparison to his Liberal Democrat and Conservative counterparts. He claimed the production company misled him. Mitchell was the President of the Debating Group.

On 29 October 2012, Mitchell directed a tweet at former Conservative MP Louise Mensch, saying &quot;A good wife doesn’t disagree with her master in public and a good little girl doesn’t lie about why she quit politics.&quot; He also referred to Mensch as &quot;Menschkin.&quot; The comments were widely condemned as being sexist, with Mensch demanding an apology from both Mitchell and Ed Miliband. Mitchell responded that he was being &quot;ironic&quot;.

In April 2014, Mitchell announced that he would not be standing in the next general election, which was held in May 2015.

==Personal life==
Austin married Dorothea Patricia Jackson in 1959: they had two daughters, Susan Ngaio and Nicola Rewa, but divorced in 1966. In 1976, he married New Zealand television producer and writer Linda McDougall: they had one son, Jonathan Vernon Mitchell, and one daughter, Hannah Kezia Mitchell. Amongst his personal interests were photography and he was a member of the Royal Photographic Society.

In July 2013, Mitchell underwent heart surgery at King&#x27;s College Hospital, London, to repair a leaking valve. He died at the coronary care unit at Leeds General Infirmary on 18 August 2021, a month before his 87th birthday. Speaking after his death, former Labour leader Tony Blair said, &quot;Austin was a larger than life figure – immense fun, a jovial manner often concealing an acute mind, a challenging colleague at times for sure but always warm-hearted and decent, and above all totally committed to Grimsby! I never had a conversation with him without coming away with a new insight or perspective which is why even when disagreeing, I had to listen.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Mitchell was portrayed in the 2009 film &quot;The Damned United&quot;, in a scene recreating his interview with Brian Clough and Don Revie. He was played by Mark Bazeley.

<doc id="415107" wikidata="Q1335466" url="?curid=415107" title="Bala Lake">
<text>Bala Lake, or (), is a large freshwater glacial lake in Gwynedd, Wales. The River Dee, which has its source on the slopes of Dduallt in the mountains of Snowdonia, feeds the long by wide lake. It was the largest natural body of water in Wales even before its level was raised by Thomas Telford to provide water for the Ellesmere Canal (later Llangollen Canal).

The town of Bala, which was once an important centre for the North Wales woollen trade, is located on the north-eastern end of the lake. The narrow-gauge Bala Lake Railway, between the town and Llanuwchllyn (whose name means &quot;church [&#x27;llan&#x27;] above [&#x27;uwch&#x27;] the lake [&#x27;llyn&#x27;]&quot;), runs along the lake&#x27;s south-eastern shore using a section of former trackbed from the former Ruabon–Barmouth line.

==Toponyms==
=== Previous names ===
Gerald of Wales records the lake in his 12th century &quot;Itinerarium Cambriae&quot; under the name &quot;Penmelesmere&quot;. In his 1804 translation of Gerald&#x27;s work, Sir Richard Colt Hoare states that the lake was also referred to as &quot;Pymplwy meer&quot; deriving from &quot;pum plwyf&quot; (five parishes). This name refers to the parishes of Llandderfel, Llanfawr, Llanycil, Llanuwchllyn and Llangywer. This name was also recorded by other English writers as &quot;Pimble-mere&quot; (in the 1813 Cambrian Travellers&#x27; Guide) and &quot;Pemble Mere&quot;.

=== Modern names ===
The Modern Welsh name &quot;Llyn Tegid&quot; first appears in the &quot;Cronica Walliae&quot;, published in 1568. The name is translated by George Borrow as &quot;Lake of Beauty&quot;, where the name &quot;Tegid&quot; derives from &quot;teg&quot;, a common Welsh place name element meaning &quot;fair&quot; (as in pleasant or fine scenery).

The lake&#x27;s name is often given as &quot;Bala Lake&quot; in English, after the nearby town of Bala. However the word &quot;bala&quot; means &quot;outlet of a lake&quot; in Welsh so might appear odd to those conversant with both languages. The usage of the English name in preference to the Welsh name is considered controversial by many. In 2023, the Eryri National Park Authority voted to use an all-Welsh list of standardised names for its lakes, thus favouring Llyn Tegid in English-language usage.

==Geology==
The lake formed in a glacial valley along the fault line between Bala and Tal-y-Llyn. Towards the end of the last ice age, the receding Dee valley glacier left a recessional moraine, effectively damming the valley so resulting in the establishment of the lake, and on which the town of Bala now stands.

==Wildlife==

The lake has abundant pike, perch, brown trout, roach, and eel. It also contains the gwyniad, a fish unique to the locality and listed as critically endangered by the IUCN due to the introduction of the invasive and non native ruffe; and the very rare mollusc &quot;Myxas glutinosa&quot; (the glutinous snail). According to legend, whilst the Dee itself flows through the lake, the waters never mix. However this was not confirmed by the detailed limnological work undertaken from the 1990s, to understand and manage the occurrence of algal blooms on the lake.

In the 1990s the lake suffered from blooms of blue-green algae which indicated a significant and worrying eutrophication of the lake. Investigation by the Environment Agency, in partnership with the water industry, the farming community and others, has put in place a plan for reducing pollution inputs to the lake.

==Water management==
The lake forms part of the River Dee regulation system and the level at its outflow is automatically controlled. Depending on flow conditions and the level of water in Llyn Celyn, water can flow either into or out of the lake at the normal outflow point. Controls on the level of water in the lake were first constructed around 1840. Sluices designed and built by Thomas Telford and William Jessop were installed to ensure that the newly constructed Ellesmere Canal had a constant and sufficient supply of water. In the 1950s, these sluices were removed when the Dee and Clwyd River Authority constructed a new outlet channel and sluices to better control flooding of the upper Dee caused by uncontrolled releases of water from the lake. The operation of these sluices enables the lake to operate as water storage or water capacitance in the Dee system and thus allow water to be abstracted at Huntington near Chester, England in order to supply fresh water to the Wirral, England.
The sluices allows water stored in the lake between 159.2m OD and 163.5m OD (4.3m height difference) to be utilised in managing the flow in the Dee. This body of water is estimated to be some 18,000,000 m3

==Recreation==

Bala has been a tourist destination since the early 19th century. With the advent of the railways, Bala saw a growth in visitor numbers. This continued with the invention of the motor vehicle. The lake remains popular; it has two sailing clubs, and a number of companies provide kayaks, yachts and various other types of boats for hire.

== In Welsh mythology ==
There was a belief in Wales that certain lakes are offended when mortals attempt to measure their depths. Two men went out in a boat to the deepest part of the lake to measure it with a plummet and line. They were angrily warned by the lake to return to the shore or face destruction.

=== Tegid Foel ===
The mythological figure &quot;Tegid Foel&quot; () is associated with the lake. He was the husband of the goddess or witch Ceridwen and the place where his court stood is now beneath the waters of the lake. According to Taliesin, the 6th century CE early Brittonic poet of Sub-Roman Britain whose work survived in a Middle Welsh manuscript, the &quot;Book of Taliesin&quot;, Tegid Foel&#x27;s entire court was drowned in one night. Although in legend, its lights and the little town around it can still be seen on moonlit nights.

The drowning of the court of Tegid Foel also survives in a variant folktale. Near the lake was a walled spring that had to be secured and locked every night with a lid so that the spring water would not be corrupted by supernatural influences. For whatever reason, the man responsible for this task neglected his duty, though some say the Devil had found a way to open it. In any event, the water burst forth from the spring and completely drowned a nearby town, and this is how the lake was formed.

=== &quot;Teggie&quot; ===

Many of Wales&#x27; largest lakes feature in Welsh mythology, often associated with lake monsters, called &quot;afancod&quot;. The legend of such a creature in this lake was recorded in 1909, when the folklorist Marie Trevelyan collated a number of local legends including the story of a coiled dragon-like creature living in the lake some centuries earlier.

Modern reports of sightings have been recorded since the 1920s. These include strange disruptions of the water&#x27;s surface, disturbance of watercraft and the increase in local belief that a beast was living below the lake&#x27;s surface. Of these sightings, the most notable was reported by the lake&#x27;s manager Dowie Bowen in the 1970s. Bowen described seeing a crocodile-like creature, about eight feet (2.4 m) in length emerge from the water. Bowen&#x27;s report was soon followed by another sighting in 1979, when a fisherman visiting the lake also described seeing a large hump-backed beast at the water&#x27;s surface. By the 1990s the various sightings had attracted film crews and investigators. One Japanese crew spent three days investigating and filming the lake using specialist diving equipment and a submarine. However, no substantial evidence for the creature&#x27;s existence has been found.

The lake is already known to be home to a unique and extant species, the gwyniad. The survival of the gwyniad has led to discussions as to whether the lake could support a larger predator, and whether such a creature could survive in its isolated environment into modern times. Supporters for the potential existence of an afanc creature suggest that both the lake&#x27;s size (40 metres deep and almost 6 km long) and the abundance of potential prey within it (pike, perch, brown trout and eels) would be able to support a single large predator or even a breeding population.

<text>Tállya is a village in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén county, Northern Hungary, 45 kilometres from county seat Miskolc, in the famous Tokaj-Hegyalja wine district.

==Geography==

Tállya is located at . According to the 2001 Census the village has a total area of .

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2001, there were 2205 people residing in the village; 98.4% Magyars, 1.3% Romani, and 0.3% other. The population density was 58/km2. There were 1004 housing units at an average density of 26.44/km2.

==History==

The area has been inhabited since ancient times. The village was first mentioned in the 13th century. According to some sources the area was settled by Walloon settlers, who brought viticulture to the area; the name of the village possibly comes from the French word &quot;taille&quot; (meaning &quot;cutting&quot;, referring that the trees of forests on the hills had to be cut so that vine can grow there).

Tállya soon became the most important village of the Tokaj-Hegyalja wine district. A letter by Bishop Andrew from 1272 mentions that after the Mongol invasion (1241–42) Italians settled down in the area. Tállya also had a castle by then, which has been destroyed since then, but some of the ruins still can be seen.

From 1584 Tállya&#x27;s Protestant pastor was Gáspár Károli, who was the first to translate the Bible to Hungarian.

In the 17th century Tállya was already mentioned as a town, surrounded by a wall and a moat. In 1631 Ferdinand II gave the town right to hold a market and exempted its citizens from taxes. In 1683 Imre Thököly and his supporters met in Tállya during his fight to free Hungary from Habsburg rule; after the freedom fight the imperial troops pillaged the area, which led to the Hegyalja uprising in 1697.

In a census from the mid-1780s Tállya was the largest town of Zemplén county with a population of 4388. The quick development of the town was mostly due to its vineyards and its hospitality. Anyone who wanted to settle down in Tállya was exempt from paying taxes for 12 years if he plants a vineyard. Still Tállya lost its town rights in 1896 because it couldn&#x27;t afford paying the expenses of being a town.

In 1928 a pyroxene and andesite mine was opened.

World War I and II claimed the lives of 110 and 87 Tállya soldiers, respectively. Soviet troops occupied the village on 14 December 1944.

After the war the population started to decrease mostly because the village&#x27;s distance from main roads, the lack of markets for wine, the decreasing price of wine, and the Socialist régime&#x27;s industrial politics which tended to favor the major cities over smaller settlements. By 1980 Tállya had only 2815 residents.

==Sport==
The association football club, Tállya KSE, is based in Tállya.

==Trivia==
* Prince Francis II Rákóczi presented Louis XIV of France with Tállya wine. The king allegedly said: &quot;This is the king of wines, the wine of kings!&quot;
* Another legend says that at the Council of Trent a Hungarian bishop gave a taste of Tállya wine to Pope Pius IV, who said &quot;Summum pontificem talia vina decent&quot; – a Latin word play meaning &quot;Tállya wine / This kind of wine is worthy to be on His Holiness&#x27; table!&quot;
* It has been said that Lajos Kossuth was baptized in Tállya in 1802, since his hometown Monok didn&#x27;t have a Protestant church. Recently this proved to be only a legend.
* Tállya is also said to be the geometrical centre of Europe, but since many other places claim this distinction, it seem to depend on what countries and areas one counts as Europeans.

<doc id="415109" wikidata="Q254748" url="?curid=415109" title="Jo Stafford">
<text>Jo Elizabeth Stafford (November 12, 1917July 16, 2008) was an American traditional pop singer, whose career spanned five decades from the late 1930s to the early 1980s. Admired for the purity of her voice, she originally underwent classical training to become an opera singer before following a career in popular music, and by 1955 had achieved more worldwide record sales than any other female artist. Her 1952 song &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; topped the charts in the United States and United Kingdom, becoming the second single to top the UK Singles Chart, and the first by a female artist to do so.

Born in remote oil-rich Coalinga, California, near Fresno in the San Joaquin Valley, Stafford made her first musical appearance at age 12. While still at high school, she joined her two older sisters to form a vocal trio named the Stafford Sisters, who found moderate success on radio and in film. In 1938, while the sisters were part of the cast of Twentieth Century Fox&#x27;s production of &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;, Stafford met the future members of the Pied Pipers and became the group&#x27;s lead singer. Bandleader Tommy Dorsey hired them in 1939 to perform vocals with his orchestra. From 1940 to 1942, the group often performed with Dorsey&#x27;s new male singer, Frank Sinatra.

In addition to her singing with the Pied Pipers, Stafford was featured in solo performances with Dorsey. After leaving the group in 1944, she recorded a series of pop songs now regarded as standards for Capitol Records and Columbia Records. Many of her recordings were backed by the orchestra of Paul Weston. She also performed duets with Gordon MacRae and Frankie Laine. Her work with the United Service Organizations giving concerts for soldiers during World War II earned her the nickname &quot;G.I. Jo&quot;. Starting in 1945, Stafford was a regular host of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) radio series &quot;The Chesterfield Supper Club&quot; and later appeared in television specialsincluding two series called &quot;The Jo Stafford Show&quot;, in 1954 in the U.S. and in 1961 in the UK.

Stafford married twice, first in 1937 to musician John Huddleston (the couple divorced in 1943), then in 1952 to Paul Weston, with whom she had two children. She and Weston developed a comedy routine in which they assumed the identity of an incompetent lounge act named Jonathan and Darlene Edwards, parodying well-known songs. The act proved popular at parties and among the wider public when the couple released an album as the Edwardses in 1957. In 1961, the album &quot;Jonathan and Darlene Edwards in Paris&quot; won Stafford her only Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album, and was the first commercially successful parody album. Stafford largely retired as a performer in the mid-1960s, but continued in the music business. She had a brief resurgence in popularity in the late 1970s when she recorded a cover of the Bee Gees hit, &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot; as Darlene Edwards. In the 1990s, she began re-releasing some of her material through Corinthian Records, a label founded by Weston. She died in 2008 in Century City, Los Angeles, and is interred with Weston at Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City. Her work in radio, television, and music is recognized by three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early years==
Jo Elizabeth Stafford was born in Coalinga, California, in 1917, to Grover Cleveland Stafford and Anna Stafford (née York)a second cousin of World War I hero Sergeant Alvin York. She was the third of four children. She had two older sisters, Christine and Pauline, and one younger sister, Betty. Both her parents enjoyed singing and sharing music with their family. Stafford&#x27;s father hoped for success in the California oil fields when he moved his family from Gainesboro, Tennessee, but worked in a succession of unrelated jobs. Her mother was an accomplished banjo player, playing and singing many of the folk songs that influenced Stafford&#x27;s later career. Anna insisted that her children should take piano lessons, but Jo was the only one among her sisters who took a keen interest in it, and through this, she learned to read music.

Stafford&#x27;s first public singing appearance was in Long Beach, where the family lived when she was 12. She sang &quot;Believe Me, If All Those Endearing Young Charms&quot;, a Stafford family favorite. Her second was far more dramatic. As a student at Long Beach Polytechnic High School with the lead in the school musical, she was rehearsing on stage when the 1933 Long Beach earthquake destroyed part of the school. With her mother&#x27;s encouragement, Stafford originally planned to become an opera singer and studied voice as a child, taking private lessons from Foster Rucker, an announcer on California radio station KNX. Because of the Great Depression, she abandoned that idea and joined her older sisters Christine and Pauline in a popular vocal group the Stafford Sisters. The two older Staffords were already part of a trio with an unrelated third member when the act got a big booking at Long Beach&#x27;s West Coast Theater. Pauline was too ill to perform, and Jo was drafted in to take her place so they could keep the engagement. She asked her glee club teacher for a week&#x27;s absence from school, saying her mother needed her at home, and this was granted. The performance was a success, and Jo became a permanent member of the group.

The Staffords&#x27; first radio appearance was on Los Angeles station KHJ as part of &quot;The Happy Go Lucky Hour&quot; when Jo was 16, a role they secured after hopefuls at the audition were asked if they had their own musical accompanist(s). Christine Stafford said that Jo played piano, and the sisters were hired, though she had not previously given a public piano performance. The Staffords were subsequently heard on KNX&#x27;s &quot;The Singing Crockett Family of Kentucky&quot;, and &quot;California Melodies&quot;, a network radio show aired on the Mutual Broadcasting System. While Stafford worked on &quot;The Jack Oakie Show&quot;, she met John Huddlestona backing singer on the program, and they were married in October 1937. The couple divorced in 1943.

The sisters found work in the film industry as backup vocalists, and immediately after graduating from high school, Jo worked on film soundtracks. The Stafford Sisters made their first recording,&quot;Let&#x27;s Get Together and Swing&quot; with Louis Prima, in 1936. In 1937, Jo worked behind the scenes with Fred Astaire on the soundtrack of &quot;A Damsel in Distress&quot;, creating the arrangements for the film, and with her sisters she arranged the backing vocals for &quot;Nice Work If You Can Get It&quot;. Stafford said that her arrangement had to be adapted because Astaire had difficulty with some of the syncopation. In her words: &quot;The man with the syncopated shoes couldn&#x27;t do the syncopated notes&quot;.
==The Pied Pipers==
By 1938, the Staffords were involved with Twentieth Century Fox&#x27;s production of &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;. The studio brought in many vocal groups to work on the film, including the Four Esquires, the Rhythm Kings, and the King Sisters, who began to sing and socialize between takes. The Stafford Sisters, the Four Esquires and the Rhythm Kings became a new vocal group called the Pied Pipers. Stafford later said, &quot;We started singing together just for fun, and these sessions led to the formation of an eight-voice singing group that we christened &#x27;The Pied Pipers. The group consisted of eight members, including StaffordJohn Huddleston, Hal Hooper, Chuck Lowry, Bud Hervey, George Tait, Woody Newbury, and Dick Whittinghill.

As the Pied Pipers, they worked on local radio and movie soundtracks. When Alyce and Yvonne King threw a party for their boyfriends&#x27; visit to Los Angeles, the group was invited to perform. The King Sisters&#x27; boyfriends were Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s arrangers Axel Stordahl and Paul Weston, who became interested in the group. Weston said the group&#x27;s vocals were unique for its time and that their vocal arrangements were much like those for orchestral instruments.

Weston persuaded Dorsey to audition the group in 1938, and the eight drove together to New York City. Dorsey liked them and signed them for 10 weeks. After their second broadcast, the sponsor visiting from overseas heard the group sing &quot;Hold Tight (Want Some Seafood Mama)&quot;. Until this point, the sponsor knew only that he was paying for Dorsey&#x27;s program and that its ratings were very good; transcription discs mailed to him by his advertising agency always arrived broken. He thought that the performance was terrible, and pressured the advertising agency representing his brand to fire the group. They stayed in New York for several months, landing one job that paid them $3.60 each, and they recorded some material for RCA Victor Records. Weston later said that Stordahl and he felt responsibility for the group, since Weston had arranged their audition with Dorsey. After six months in New York and with no work there for them, the Pied Pipers returned to Los Angeles, where four of their members left the group to seek regular employment. Shortly afterwards, Stafford received a telephone call from Dorsey, who told her he wished to hire the group, but wanted only four of them, including Stafford. After she agreed to the offer, the remaining Pied PipersStafford, Huddleston, Lowry, and Wilsontraveled to Chicago in 1939. The decision led to success for the group, especially Stafford, who featured in both collective and solo performances with Dorsey&#x27;s orchestra.

When Frank Sinatra joined the Dorsey band, he and the Pied Pipers often performed together on songs, alternating between his solos and him singing with the group. Sometimes they both had solos as well as being in the group. Stafford commented that he was very careful to blend his voice with theirs when singing with them. Their version of &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Smile Again&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Chart for 12 weeks in 1940 and helped to establish Sinatra as a singer. Stafford, Sinatra, and the Pied Pipers toured extensively with Dorsey during their three years as part of his orchestra, giving concerts at venues across the United States. Stafford made her first solo recording&quot;Little Man with a Candy Cigar&quot;in 1941, after Dorsey agreed to her request to record solo. Her public debut as a soloist with the band occurred at New York&#x27;s Hotel Astor in May 1942. Bill Davidson of &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; reported in 1951 that because Stafford weighed in excess of 180 lb, Dorsey was reluctant to give her a leading vocal role in his orchestra, believing she was not sufficiently glamorous for the part. However, Peter Levinson&#x27;s 2005 biography of Dorsey offers a different account. Stafford recalls that she was overweight, but Dorsey did not try hiding her because of it.

In November 1942, the Pied Pipers had a disagreement with Dorsey when he fired Clark Yocum, a guitarist and vocalist who had replaced Billy Wilson in the lineup, when he mistakenly gave the bandleader misdirections at a railroad station in Portland, Oregon. The remaining three members then quit in an act of solidarity. At the time, the number-one song in the United States was &quot;There Are Such Things&quot; by Frank Sinatra and the Pied Pipers. Sinatra also left Dorsey that year. Following their departure from the orchestra, the Pied Pipers played a series of vaudeville dates in the Eastern United States; when they returned to California, they were signed to appear in the 1943 Universal Pictures movie &quot;Gals Incorporated&quot;. From there, they joined the NBC Radio show &quot;Bob Crosby and Company&quot;. In addition to working with Bob Crosby, they also appeared on radio shows hosted by Sinatra and Johnny Mercer, and were one of the first groups signed to Mercer&#x27;s new label, Capitol Records, which was founded in 1942. Weston, who left Dorsey&#x27;s band in 1940 to work with Dinah Shore, became music director at Capitol.

==Solo career==

===Capitol Records and United Service Organization===
While Stafford was still working for Dorsey, Johnny Mercer told her, &quot;Some day I&#x27;m going to have my own record company, and you&#x27;re going to record for me.&quot; She subsequently became the first solo artist signed to Capitol after leaving the Pied Pipers in 1944. A key figure in helping Stafford to develop her solo career was Mike Nidorf, an agent who first heard her as a member of the Pied Pipers while he was serving as a captain in the United States Army. Having previously discovered artists such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford&#x27;s voice, and contacted her when he was demobilized in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile and confidence.

The success of Stafford&#x27;s solo career led to a demand for personal appearances, and from February 1945, she embarked on a six-month residency at New York&#x27;s La Martinique nightclub. Her performance was well-received; an article in the July 1945 edition of &quot;Band Leaders&quot; magazine described it as &quot;sensational&quot;, but Stafford did not enjoy singing before live audiences, and it was the only nightclub venue she ever played. Speaking about her discomfort with live performances, Stafford told a 1996 interview with &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s Nancy Franklin, &quot;I&#x27;m basically a singer, period, and I think I&#x27;m really lousy up in front of an audienceit&#x27;s just not me.&quot;

Stafford&#x27;s tenure with the United Service Organizations during World War II, which often had her perform for soldiers stationed in the U.S., led to her acquiring the nickname &quot;G.I. Jo&quot;. On returning from the Pacific theater, a veteran told Stafford that the Japanese would play her records on loudspeakers in an attempt to make the U.S. troops homesick enough to surrender. She replied personally to all the letters she received from servicemen. Stafford was a favorite of many servicemen during both World War II and the Korean War; her recordings received extensive airplay on the American Forces radio and in some military hospitals at lights-out. Stafford&#x27;s involvement with servicemen led to an interest in military history and a sound knowledge of it. Years after World War II, Stafford was a guest at a dinner party with a retired naval officer. When the discussion turned to a wartime action off Mindanao, the officer tried to correct Stafford, who held to her point. He countered her by saying, &quot;Madame, I was there&quot;. A few days after the party, Stafford received a note of apology from him, saying he had reread his logs and that she was correct.

===Chesterfield Supper Club, duets, and Voice of America===

Beginning on December 11, 1945, Stafford hosted the Tuesday and Thursday broadcasts of NBC musical variety radio program &quot;The Chesterfield Supper Club&quot;. On April 5, 1946, the entire cast, including Stafford and Perry Como, participated in the first commercial radio broadcast from an airplane. The initial plan was to use the stand-held microphones used in studios, but when these proved to be problematic, the cast switched to hand-held microphones, which because of the plane&#x27;s cabin pressure became difficult to hold. Three flights were made that day; a rehearsal in the afternoon, then two in the eveningone for the initial 6:00 pm broadcast and another at 10:00 pm for the West Coast broadcast.

Stafford moved from New York to California in November 1946, continuing to host &quot;Chesterfield Supper Club&quot; from Hollywood. In 1948, she restricted her appearances on the show to Tuesdays, and Peggy Lee hosted the Thursday broadcasts. Stafford left the show when it was expanded to 30 minutes, making her final appearance on September 2, 1949. She returned to the program in 1954; it ended its run on NBC Radio the following year. During her time with &quot;Chesterfield Supper Club&quot;, Stafford revisited some of the folk music she had enjoyed as a child. Weston, her conductor on the program, suggested using some of the folk music for the show. With her renewed interest in folk tunes came an interest in folklore; Stafford established a contest to award a prize to the best collection of American folklore submitted by a college student. The annual Jo Stafford Prize for American Folklore was handled by the American Folklore Society, with the first prize of $250 awarded in 1949.

Stafford continued to record. She duetted with Gordon MacRae on a number of songs. In 1948, their version of &quot;Say Something Sweet to Your Sweetheart&quot; sold over a million copies. The following year, they repeated their success with &quot;My Happiness&quot;, and Stafford and MacRae recorded &quot;Whispering Hope&quot; together. Stafford began hosting a weekly program on Radio Luxembourg in 1950; working unpaid, she recorded the voice portions of the shows in Hollywood. At the time, she was hosting &quot;Club Fifteen&quot; with Bob Crosby for CBS Radio.

Weston moved from Capitol to Columbia Records, and in 1950, Stafford followed suit. Content and very comfortable working with him, Stafford had had a clause inserted in her contract with Capitol stating that if Weston left that label, she would automatically be released from her obligations to them. When that happened, Capitol wanted Stafford to record eight more songs before December 15, 1950, and she found herself in the unusual situation of simultaneously working for two competing record companies, an instance that was very rare in an industry where musicians were seen as assets. In 1954, Stafford became the second artist after Bing Crosby to sell 25 million records for Columbia. She was presented with a diamond-studded disc to mark the occasion.

In 1950, Stafford began working for Voice of America (VOA), the U.S. government broadcaster transmitting programmes overseas to undermine the influence of communism. She presented a weekly show that aired in Eastern Europe, and &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; published an article about the program in its April 21, 1951, issue that discussed her worldwide popularity, including in countries behind the Iron Curtain. The article, titled &quot;Jo Stafford: Her Songs Upset Joe Stalin&quot;, earned her the wrath of the U.S. Communist &quot;Daily Worker&quot; newspaper, which published a column critical of Stafford and VOA.

===Marriage to Paul Weston and later career===
Although Stafford and Paul Weston had known each other since their introduction at the King Sisters&#x27; party, they did not become romantically involved until 1945, when Weston traveled to New York to see Stafford perform at La Martinique. They were married in a Roman Catholic ceremony on February 26, 1952, before which Stafford converted to Catholicism. The wedding was conducted at St Gregory&#x27;s Catholic Church in Los Angeles by Father Joe Kearney, a former guitarist with the Bob Crosby band, who left the music business, trained as a priest, and served as head of the Catholic Labor Institute. The couple left for Europe for a combined honeymoon and business trip: Stafford had an engagement at the London Palladium. Stafford and Weston had two children; Tim was born in 1952 and Amy in 1956. Both children followed their parents into the music industry. Tim Weston became an arranger and producer who took charge of Corinthian Records, his father&#x27;s music label, and Amy Weston became a session singer, performing with a trio, Daddy&#x27;s Money, and singing in commercials.
In the 1950s, Stafford had a string of popular hits with Frankie Laine, six of which charted. Their duet of the Hank Williams song &quot;Hey Good Lookin&#x27;&quot; made the top 10 in 1951. She had her best-known hits&quot;Jambalaya&quot;, &quot;Shrimp Boats&quot;, &quot;Make Love to Me&quot;, and &quot;You Belong to Me&quot;around this time. &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; was Stafford&#x27;s biggest hit, topping the charts in the United States and the United Kingdom. In the UK, it was the first song by a female singer to top the chart. The record first appeared on U.S. charts on August 1, 1952, and remained there for 24 weeks. In the UK, it entered the charts on November 14, 1952, at number 2, reached number one on January 16, 1953, and stayed on the charts for 19 weeks. In a July 1953 interview, Paul Weston said his wife&#x27;s big hit was really the &quot;B&quot; side of the single &quot;Pretty Boy&quot;, which both Weston and Columbia Records believed would be the big seller.

In 1953, Stafford signed a four-year $1 million deal with CBS-TV. She hosted the 15-minute &quot;The Jo Stafford Show&quot; on CBS from 1954 to 1955, with Weston as her conductor and music arranger. She appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Club Oasis&quot; in 1958, and on the ABC series &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot; in 1959. In the early 1960s, Stafford hosted a series of television specials called &quot;The Jo Stafford Show&quot;, which were centered around music. The shows were produced in England and featured British and American guests including Claire Bloom, Stanley Holloway, Ella Fitzgerald, Mel Tormé, and Rosemary Clooney.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kloss/Milwaukee Journal&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Stafford and Weston returned to Capitol in 1961. During her second stint at Capitol, Stafford also recorded for Sinatra&#x27;s label Reprise Records. The albums issued by Reprise were released between 1961 and 1964, and were mostly remakes of songs from her past. Sinatra sold Reprise to Warner Bros. in 1963, and they retargeted the label at a teenage audience, letting go many of the original artists who had signed up with Sinatra. In late 1965, both Stafford and Weston signed to Dot Records.
==Comedy performances==

During the 1940s, Stafford briefly performed comedy songs under the name &quot;Cinderella G. Stump&quot; with Red Ingle and the Natural Seven. In 1947, she recorded a hillbilly-style parody of &quot;Temptation&quot;, pronouncing its title &quot;Tim-tayshun&quot;. Stafford created Stump after Weston suggested her for the role when Ingle said his female vocalist was unavailable for the recording session. After meeting Ingle at a recording studio, she gave an impromptu performance. The speed of her voice was intentionally increased for the song, giving it the hillbilly sound, and the listening public did not initially know that her voice was on the record. Because it was a lighthearted, impromptu performance and she accepted the standard scale pay, Stafford waived all royalties from the record. Stafford, along with Ingle and Weston, made a personal appearance tour in 1949, and she performed &quot;Temptation&quot; as Cinderella G. Stump. Stafford and Ingle performed the song on network television in 1960 for &quot;Startime&quot;. Stafford recorded a second song with Ingle in 1948. &quot;The Prisoner of Love&#x27;s Song&quot; was a parody of &quot;Prisoner of Love&quot;, and featured in an advertisement for Capitol releases in the January 8, 1949, edition of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine.

Throughout the 1950s, Stafford and Weston entertained party guests by performing skits in which they impersonated a poor lounge act. Stafford sang off-key in a high pitched voice and Weston played songs on the piano in unconventional rhythms. Weston began his impression of an unskilled pianist in or around 1955, assuming the guise &quot;when things got a little quiet, or when people began taking themselves too seriously at a Hollywood party.&quot; He put on an impromptu performance of the act the following year at a Columbia Records sales convention in Key West, Florida, after hearing a particularly bad hotel pianist. The audience was very appreciative of his rendition of &quot;Stardust&quot;, particularly Columbia executives George Avakian and Irving Townsend, who encouraged Weston to make an album of such songs. Avakian named Weston&#x27;s character Jonathan Edwards, for the 18th century Calvinist preacher of the same name, and asked him to record under this alias. Weston worried that he might not be able to find enough material for an entire album, and he asked his wife to join the project. Stafford named her off-key vocalist persona Darlene Edwards.

Stafford&#x27;s creation of Darlene Edwards had its roots in the novelty songs that Mitch Miller, the head of Columbia&#x27;s artists and repertoire department, had been selecting for her to sing. These included songs such as &quot;Underneath the Overpass&quot;, and because she did not agree with Miller&#x27;s music choices for her, Stafford and her studio musicians often recorded their own renditions of the music, performing the songs according to their feelings about them. Because she had some unused studio time at a 1957 recording session, as a joke Stafford recorded a track as Darlene Edwards. Those who heard bootlegs of the recording responded positively, and later that year, Stafford and Weston recorded an album of songs as Jonathan and Darlene, entitled &quot;The Piano Artistry of Jonathan Edwards&quot;.

As a publicity stunt, Weston and Stafford claimed that Jonathan and Darlene Edwards were a New Jersey lounge act they had discovered, and denied any personal connection. This ruse led to much speculation about the Edwardses&#x27; identities. In an article titled &quot;Two Right Hands&quot; in September 1957, &quot;Time&quot; reported that some people believed the performers were Harry and Margaret Truman, but the same piece identified Weston and Stafford as the Edwardses. In 1958, Stafford and Weston appeared as the Edwardses on Jack Benny&#x27;s television program &quot;Shower of Stars&quot;, and in 1960 on &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;. &quot;The Piano Artistry of Jonathan Edwards&quot; was followed up with an album of popular music standards, &quot;Jonathan and Darlene Edwards in Paris&quot;, which was released in 1960 and won that year&#x27;s Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. The Academy issued two awards for the category that year; Bob Newhart also received an award for &quot;Spoken Word Comedy&quot; for his album &quot;The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!&quot; The Grammy was Stafford&#x27;s only major award.

The couple continued to release comedy albums for several years, and in 1977 released a cover of the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot; as a single, with an Edwards interpretation of Helen Reddy&#x27;s &quot;I Am Woman&quot; as its &quot;B&quot; side. The same year, a brief resurgence in the popularity of Jonathan and Darlene albums occurred when their cover of &quot;Carioca&quot; was featured as the opening and closing theme to &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot;. Their last release, &quot;Darlene Remembers Duke, Jonathan Plays Fats&quot;, was issued in 1982. To mark the occasion, an interview with Stafford and Westonin which they assumed the persona of the Edwardsesappeared in the December 1982 edition of &quot;Los Angeles Magazine&quot;.

==Retirement and later life==
In 1959, Stafford was offered a contract to perform at Las Vegas, but declined it to concentrate on her family life. Because she disliked continuously traveling for television appearances that took her away from her children, and no longer found the music business fun, she went into semiretirement in the mid-1960s. She retired fully in 1975. Except for the Jonathan and Darlene Edwards material, and re-recording her favorite song &quot;Whispering Hope&quot; with her daughter Amy in 1978, Stafford did not perform again until 1990, at a ceremony honoring Frank Sinatra. The Westons devoted more time to Share Inc., a charity aiding people with developmental disabilities in which they had been active for many years. Around 1983, Concord Records tried to persuade Stafford to change her mind and come out of retirement, but although an album was planned, she did not feel she would be satisfied with the finished product, and the project was shelved.

Stafford won a breach-of-contract lawsuit against her former record label Columbia in the early 1990s. Because of a clause concerning the payment of royalties in her contract, she secured the rights to all of the recordings she made with the company, including those Weston and she made as Jonathan and Darlene Edwards. After the lawsuit was settled, Stafford and her son Tim reactivated Corinthian Records, which Weston, a devout Christian, had started as a label for religious music in the 1970s, and they began releasing some of her old material.

In 1996, Paul Weston died of natural causes; Stafford continued to operate Corinthian Records. In 2006, she donated the couple&#x27;s library, including music arrangements, photographs, business correspondence and recordings, to the University of Arizona. Stafford began suffering from congestive heart failure in October 2007, from which she died aged 90 on July 16, 2008. She was buried with her husband at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

==Style, awards, and recognition==
Stafford was admired by critics and the listening public for the purity of her voice, and was considered one of the most versatile vocalists of her era. Peter Levinson said that she was a coloratura soprano, whose operatic training allowed her to sing a natural falsetto. Her style encompassed a number of genres, including big band, ballads, jazz, folk and comedy. Music critic Terry Teachout described her as &quot;rhythmically fluid without ever sounding self-consciously &#x27;jazzy&#x27; &quot;, while Rosemary Clooney said of her, &quot;The voice says it all: beautiful, pure, straightforward, no artifice, matchless intonation, instantly recognizable. Those things describe the woman, too.&quot; Writing for the &quot;New York Sun&quot;, Will Friedwald described her 1947 interpretation of &quot;Haunted Heart&quot; as &quot;effective because it&#x27;s so subtle, because Stafford holds something back and doesn&#x27;t shove her emotion in the listener&#x27;s face.&quot; Nancy Franklin described Stafford&#x27;s version of the folk song &quot;He&#x27;s Gone Away&quot; as &quot;wistful and tender, as if she had picked up a piece of clothing once worn by a loved one and begun singing.&quot; Remembering when he and Stafford were both singers in the Tommy Dorsey band in the early 40s, Frank Sinatra said, &quot;It was a joy to sit on the bandstand and listen to her&quot;. The singer Judy Collins has cited Stafford&#x27;s folk recordings as an influence on her own musical career. Country singer Patsy Cline was also inspired by Stafford&#x27;s work.

In their guise of Jonathan and Darlene Edwards, Weston and Stafford earned admiration from their show-business peers. Pianist George Shearing was a fan and would play &quot;Autumn in New York&quot; in the style of Edwards if he knew the couple were in the audience. Ray Charles also enjoyed their performance. Art Carney, who played Ed Norton in the comedy series &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, once wrote the Edwardses a fan letter as Norton. However, not everybody appreciated the Edwards act. Mitch Miller blamed the couple&#x27;s 1962 album &quot;Sing Along With Jonathan and Darlene Edwards&quot; for ending his sing-along albums and television show, while in 2003, Stafford told Michael Feinstein that the Bee Gees had disliked the Edwards&#x27; version of &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot;.

In 1960, Stafford said working closely with Weston had good and bad points. His knowledge of her made arranging her music easy for him, but sometimes it caused difficulties. Weston knew Stafford&#x27;s abilities and would write or arrange elaborate music because he knew she was capable of performing it. She also said she did not believe she could perform in Broadway musicals because she thought her voice was not powerful enough for stage work. In 2003, she recalled that rehearsal time was often limited before she recorded a song, and how Weston would sometimes slip musical arrangements under the bathroom door as she was in the bath getting ready to go to the studio.

Her work in radio, television, and music is recognized by three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1952, listeners of Radio Luxembourg voted Stafford their favorite female singer. The New York Fashion Academy named her one of the Best Dressed Women of 1955. &quot;Songbirds&quot; magazine has reported that, by 1955, Stafford had amassed more worldwide record sales than any other female artist, and that she was ranked fifth overall. She was nominated in the Best Female Singer category at the 1955 Emmy Awards. She won a Grammy for &quot;Jonathan and Darlene Edwards in Paris&quot;, and The Pied Pipers&#x27; recording of &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Smile Again&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1982, as was Stafford&#x27;s version of &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; in 1998. She was inducted into the Big Band Academy of America&#x27;s Golden Bandstand in April 2007. Stafford and Weston were founding members of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.

Stafford&#x27;s music has been referenced in popular culture. Her recording of &quot;Blues in the Night&quot; features in a scene of James Michener&#x27;s novel &quot;The Drifters&quot; (1971), while a Marine Corps sergeant major in Walter Murphy&#x27;s &quot;The Vicar of Christ&quot; (1979) hears a radio broadcast of her singing &quot;On Top of Old Smoky&quot; shortly before a battle in Korea. Commenting on the latter reference for his 1989 book &quot;Singers and the Song&quot;, which includes a chapter about Stafford, author Gene Lees says, &quot;[it] somehow sets Stafford&#x27;s place in the American culture. You&#x27;re getting pretty famous when your name turns up in crossword puzzles; you are woven into a nation&#x27;s history when you turn up in its fiction.&quot;

==Film and television==

Stafford appeared in films from the 1930s onwards, including &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;. Her final on-screen appearance was in the Frank Sinatra tribute &quot;Sinatra 75: The Best Is Yet to Come&quot; in 1990. She declined several offers of television work because she was forced to memorize scripts (as she was unable to read the cue cards without her glasses), and the bright studio lights caused her discomfort.

<doc id="415110" wikidata="Q5266261" url="?curid=415110" title="Deutsch's scale illusion">
<text>Deutsch&#x27;s scale illusion is an auditory illusion in which two series of unconnected notes appear to combine into a single recognisable melody, when played simultaneously into the left and right ears of a listener.

The illusion is produced by simultaneous ascending and descending major scales beginning in separate stereo channels with each successive note being switched to the opposite channel. With the left channel: C&#x27;-D-A-F--A-D-C&#x27;; and the right: C-B-E-G--E-B-C; the ear hears both: C&#x27;-B-A-G--A-B-C&#x27;; and: C-D-E-F--E-D-C. The tones are equal-amplitude sine waves, and the sequence is played repeatedly without pause at a rate of four tones per second.

When listening to the illusion over headphones, most right-handers hear a melody corresponding to the higher tones as on the right and a melody corresponding to the lower tones as on the left. When the earphone positions are reversed, the higher tones continue to appear to be coming from the right and the lower tones from the left. Other people experience different illusions, such as the higher tones on the left and the lower tones on the right, or a pattern in which the sounds appear to be localized in different and changing ways. Right-handers and left-handers differ statistically in how the scale illusion is perceived.

The effect was discovered by Diana Deutsch in 1973. In a clinical study, patients with hemispatial neglect were shown to experience the scale illusion. Further, in an MEG study on normal listeners the scale illusion was found to be neurally represented at or near the auditory cortex.

<doc id="415113" wikidata="Q7840487" url="?curid=415113" title="Tribune (magazine)">
<text>Tribune is a democratic socialist political magazine founded in 1937 and published in London, initially as a newspaper, then converting to a magazine in 2001. While it is independent, it has usually supported the Labour Party from the left. Previous editors at the magazine have included Aneurin Bevan, the minister of health who spearheaded the establishment of the National Health Service, former Labour leader Michael Foot, and writer George Orwell, who served as literary editor.

From 2008 it faced serious financial difficulties until it was purchased by &quot;Jacobin&quot; in late 2018, shifting to a quarterly publication model. Since its relaunch the number of paying subscribers has passed 15,000, with columns from high-profile socialist politicians such as former leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn, former Second Deputy Prime Minister of Spain Pablo Iglesias and former Bolivian President Evo Morales. In January 2020, it was used as the platform on which Rebecca Long-Bailey chose to launch her Labour leadership campaign.

==History==

=== Origins ===
&quot;Tribune&quot; was founded in early 1937 by two wealthy left-wing Labour Party Members of Parliament (MPs), Sir Stafford Cripps and George Strauss, to back the Unity Campaign, an attempt to secure an anti-fascist and anti-appeasement united front between the Labour Party and socialist parties to the left. The latter included Cripps&#x27;s (Labour-affiliated) Socialist League, the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB).

The paper&#x27;s first editor was William Mellor. Among its journalists were Michael Foot and Barbara Betts (later Barbara Castle), while the board included the Labour MPs Aneurin Bevan and Ellen Wilkinson, Harold Laski of the Left Book Club, and the veteran left-wing journalist and former ILP member H. N. Brailsford.

Mellor was fired in 1938 for refusing to adopt a new CPGB policy – supported by Cripps – of backing a popular front, including non-socialist parties, against fascism and appeasement; Foot resigned in solidarity. Mellor was succeeded by H. J. Hartshorn, a secret member of the CPGB. Meanwhile, Victor Gollancz, the Left Book Club&#x27;s publisher, joined the board of directors. For the next year, the paper was little more than an appendage of the Left Book Club, taking an uncritical line on the Popular Front and the Soviet Union.

===1940s===
With the Nazi-Soviet pact and the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, &quot;Tribune&quot; initially adopted the CPGB&#x27;s position of denouncing the British and French declarations of war on Germany as imperialist. After the Soviet invasion of Finland, with Cripps off on a world tour, Strauss and Bevan became increasingly impatient with Hartshorn&#x27;s unrelenting Stalinism. Strauss fired Hartshorn in February 1940, replacing him as editor with Raymond Postgate. Under Postgate&#x27;s editorship, the Soviet fellow travellers at &quot;Tribune&quot; were either dismissed, or in Postgate&#x27;s words, &quot;left soon after in dislike of me&quot;. From then on, the paper became the voice of the pro-war democratic left in the Labour Party, taking a position similar to that adopted by Gollancz in the volume &quot;Betrayal of the Left&quot; he edited attacking the communists for backing the Nazi-Soviet pact.
Bevan ousted Postgate after a series of personality clashes in 1941, assuming the role of editor himself, although the day-to-day running of the paper was done by Jon Kimche. The &quot;Tribune&quot; campaigned vigorously for the opening of a second front against Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Germany, was consistently critical of the Winston Churchill government&#x27;s failings, and argued that only a democratic socialist post-war settlement in Britain and Europe as a whole was viable.

George Orwell was hired in 1943 as literary editor. In this role, as well as commissioning and writing reviews, he wrote a series of columns, most of them under the title &quot;As I Please&quot;, that have become touchstones of the opinion journalist&#x27;s craft. Orwell left the &quot;Tribune&quot; staff in early 1945 to become a war correspondent for &quot;The Observer&quot;, to be replaced as literary editor by his friend Tosco Fyvel, but he remained a regular contributor until March 1947.

Orwell&#x27;s most famous contributions to &quot;Tribune&quot; as a columnist include &quot;You and the Atom Bomb&quot;, &quot;The sporting spirit&quot;, &quot;Books v cigarettes&quot;, &quot;Decline of the English Murder&quot;, and &quot;Some Thoughts on the Common Toad&quot;, all of which have since appeared in dozens of anthologies.

Other writers who contributed to &quot;Tribune&quot; in the 1940s include Naomi Mitchison, Stevie Smith, Alex Comfort, Arthur Calder-Marshall, Julian Symons, Elizabeth Taylor, Rhys Davies, Daniel George, Inez Holden, and Phyllis Shand Allfrey.

Kimche left &quot;Tribune&quot; to join Reuters in 1945, his place being taken by Frederic Mullally. After the Labour landslide election victory of 1945, Bevan joined Clement Attlee&#x27;s government and formally left the paper, leaving Mullally and Evelyn Anderson as joint editors, with Foot playing Bevan&#x27;s role of political director. Over the next five years, &quot;Tribune&quot; was critically involved in every key political event in the life of the Labour government and reached its highest-ever circulation, of some 40,000. Foot persuaded Kimche to return as joint editor in 1946 (after Mullally&#x27;s departure to the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot;) and in 1948 himself became joint editor with Anderson, after Kimche was fired for disappearing from the office to travel to Istanbul to negotiate the safe passage of two Jewish refugee ships through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles.

In the first few years of the Attlee administration, &quot;Tribune&quot; became the focus for the Labour left&#x27;s attempts to persuade Ernest Bevin, the Foreign Secretary, to adopt a &quot;third force&quot; democratic socialist foreign policy, with Europe acting independently from the United States and the Soviet Union, most coherently advanced in the pamphlet &quot;Keep Left&quot; (which was published by the rival &quot;New Statesman&quot;).

After the Soviet rejection of Marshall Aid and the communist takeover of Czechoslovakia in 1948, &quot;Tribune&quot; endorsed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and took a strongly anti-communist line, with its editor declaring in November 1948: &quot;The major threat to democratic socialism and the major danger of war in Europe arises from Soviet policy and not from American policy. It is not the Americans who have imposed a blockade on Berlin. It is not the Americans who have used conspiratorial methods to destroy democratic socialist parties in one country after another. It is not the Americans who have blocked effective action through one United Nations agency after another&quot;.

=== Bevanism and Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ===
Foot remained in the editorial chair until 1952 when Bob Edwards took over, but he returned after losing his parliamentary seat in Plymouth in 1955. During the early 1950s, &quot;Tribune&quot; became the organ of the Bevanite left opposition to the Labour Party leadership, turning against the United States over its handling of the Korean War, then arguing strongly against West German rearmament and nuclear arms. However, &quot;Tribune&quot; remained critical of the Soviet Union as it denounced Stalin on his death in 1953 and in 1956 opposed the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian Revolution and the British government&#x27;s Suez adventure. The paper and Bevan parted company after his &quot;naked into the conference chamber&quot; speech at the 1957 Labour Party conference. For the next five years, &quot;Tribune&quot; was at the forefront of the campaign to commit Labour to a non-nuclear defence policy, &quot;the official weekly of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament&quot; (CND) as the direct actionists in the peace movement put it. CND&#x27;s general secretary Peggy Duff had been &quot;Tribune&quot; general manager. Among journalists on &quot;Tribune&quot; in the 1950s were Richard Clements, Ian Aitken and Mervyn Jones, who related his experience on the paper in his autobiography &quot;Chances&quot;.

===1960s and 1970s===
After Foot was re-elected to Parliament in 1960 for Bevan&#x27;s old seat of Ebbw Vale, Richard Clements became editor. During the 1960s and 1970s the paper faithfully expressed the ideas of the parliamentary Labour left and allied itself with the new generation of left-wing trade union leaders that emerged on the back of a wave of workplace militancy from the early 1960s onwards.

As such, it played a massive role in the politics of the time. Although it welcomed the election of Harold Wilson&#x27;s Labour government in 1964—&quot;Tribune takes over from Eton in the cabinet&quot;, exclaimed a headline—the paper became rapidly disillusioned. It denounced the Wilson government&#x27;s timidity on nationalisation and devaluation, opposed its moves to join the European Communities (EC) and attacked it for failing to take a principled position against the Vietnam War. It also backed the unions&#x27; campaigns against the government&#x27;s prices-and-incomes policies and against &quot;In Place of Strife&quot;, Barbara Castle&#x27;s 1969 package of trade union law reforms.

The paper continued in the same vein after Edward Heath won the 1970 general election, opposing his Tory government&#x27;s trade union legislation between 1970 and 1974 and placing itself at the head of opposition to Heath&#x27;s negotiations for Britain to join the EEC. After Labour regained power in 1974, &quot;Tribune&quot; played a central part in the &quot;no&quot; campaign in the 1975 referendum on British EEC membership.

However, &quot;Tribune&quot; in this period did not speak to, let alone represent, the concerns of the younger generation of leftists who were at the centre of the campaign against the Vietnam War and the post-1968 student revolt, who found the paper&#x27;s reformism and commitment to Labour tame and old-fashioned. Circulation, around 20,000 in 1960, was said by 1980 to be around 10,000, but it was in fact much less.

===Brief support of Tony Benn===
Clements resigned as editor in 1982 to become a political adviser to Foot (by now Labour leader), a role he continued under Foot&#x27;s successor as Labour leader, Neil Kinnock. Clements was succeeded in the &quot;Tribune&quot; chair by Chris Mullin, who steered the paper into supporting Tony Benn (then just past the peak of his influence on the Labour left) and attempted to turn it into a friendly society in which readers were invited to buy shares, much to the consternation of the old Bevanite shareholders, most prominent among them John Silkin and Donald Bruce, who attempted unsuccessfully to take control of the paper. A protracted dispute ensued that at one point seemed likely to close the paper.

===Paper of the soft left===
Mullin left in 1984, with circulation at around 6,000, a level it roughly remained for the next ten years. He was replaced by his equally Bennite protege Nigel Williamson, who surprised everyone by arguing for a realignment of the left and took the paper into the soft left camp, supporting Kinnock, a long-time &quot;Tribune&quot; contributor and onetime board member, as Labour leader against the Bennites. The next two editors Phil Kelly and Paul Anderson took much the same line, although both clashed with Kinnock, particularly over his decision to abandon Labour&#x27;s non-nuclear defence policy.

Under Kelly, &quot;Tribune&quot; supported John Prescott&#x27;s challenge to Roy Hattersley as Labour Deputy leader in 1988 and came close to going bust, a fate averted by an emergency appeal launched by a front page exclaiming &quot;Don&#x27;t let this be the last issue of &quot;Tribune&quot;&quot;. Under Anderson, the paper took a strongly pro-European stance, supported electoral reform and argued for military intervention against Serbian aggression in Croatia and Bosnia. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, &quot;Tribune&quot; acted as a clearing house for arguments inside the Labour Party, with contributions from all major players.

===Back to basics===
From 1993, Mark Seddon shifted &quot;Tribune&quot; several degrees back to the left, particularly after Tony Blair became Labour leader in 1994. The paper strongly opposed Blair&#x27;s abandonment of Clause Four of the Labour Party constitution and resisted his rebranding of the party as New Labour.

After Labour won the 1997 general election, the paper maintained an oppositionist stance, objecting to the Blair government&#x27;s military interventions and its reliance on spin-doctors. In 2001, &quot;Tribune&quot; opposed the United States-led invasion of Afghanistan and it was outspoken against the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The paper under Seddon also reverted to an anti-European position very similar to that it adopted in the 1970s and early 1980s and campaigned for Gordon Brown to replace Blair as Labour leader and prime minister.

&quot;Tribune&quot; changed format from newspaper to magazine in April 2001, but remained plagued by financial uncertainty, coming close to folding again in 2002. However, Seddon and the chairman of Tribune Publications, Labour MP Peter Kilfoyle, led a team of pro-bono advisers who organised a rescue package with a consortium of trade unions (Unison, Amicus, Aslef, Communication Workers Union, Community, T&amp;GWU), who became majority shareholders in return for a significant investment in the magazine in early 2004.

Whilst &quot;Tribune&quot; editor, Seddon was elected several times to the Labour Party National Executive Committee as a candidate of the Grassroots Alliance coalition of left-wing activists. He resigned as editor in summer 2004 and was succeeded by Chris McLaughlin, former political editor of the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;.

During 2007, &quot;Tribune&quot; spawned two offshoot websites: a Tribune Cartoons blog, put together by cartoonists who draw for the magazine; and a &quot;Tribune&quot; History blog.

In September 2008, the magazine&#x27;s future was again in doubt thanks to problems with its trade union funding. An attempt by the Unite trade union to render &quot;Tribune&quot; its wholly owned subsidiary had a mixed response, but on 9 October it was announced that the magazine would close on 31 October if a buyer could not be found. The uncertainty continued until early December 2008, when it emerged that a 51% stake was being sold to an unnamed Labour Party activist for £1, with an undertaking to support the magazine for £40,000 per annum, and with debts written off by the trade union now-former owners.

&quot;Tribune&quot;″s cartoonists were Alex Hughes, Matthew Buck, Jon Jensen, Martin Rowson and Gary Barker.

===Changes of ownership (2009–2018)===
In March 2009, 100% ownership of the magazine passed to Kevin McGrath through a new company, Tribune Publications 2009 Limited, with the intention of keeping &quot;Tribune&quot; a left-of-centre publication, though broadening the readership.

In late October 2011, the future of &quot;Tribune&quot; looked bleak once again when McGrath warned of possible closure because subscriptions and income had not risen as had been hoped. Unless a buyer could be found or a cooperative established, the last edition would have been published on 4 November. McGrath committed to paying off the magazine&#x27;s debts. Another rescue plan saved the magazine at the end of October. In 2013, &quot;Tribune&quot; claimed a circulation of 5,000.

In the autumn of 2016, the journal was owned by the businessman Owen Oyston, who acquired its parent company London Publications Ltd. Oyston filed for bankruptcy and ceased to publish &quot;Tribune&quot; in January 2018.

=== Relaunch (2018–present) ===
In May 2018, it was announced that the Tribune IP had been sold to the American socialist magazine &quot;Jacobin&quot;. In August 2018, &quot;Jacobin&quot; publisher Bhaskar Sunkara confirmed the purchase of &quot;Tribune&quot; in media reports, stating that he aimed to relaunch the magazine ahead of the Labour Party Conference in September. At the official re-launch in September 2018, &quot;Tribune&quot; was announced as a bimonthly magazine with a high-quality design, concentrating on longer-form political analysis and industrial issues coverage, thus differentiating &quot;Tribune&quot; from other UK leftist media outlets such as Novara Media and the &quot;Morning Star&quot;. &quot;Tribune&quot; had 2,000 subscribers, with an aim of reaching 10,000 within a year. The magazine is currently published quarterly. In December 2020, the magazine&#x27;s editor announced it had 15,000 subscribers.

&quot;Tribune&quot; often represents the views of Labour-aligned left, most notably for being the publication chosen to launch Rebecca Long-Bailey&#x27;s leadership campaign. High-profile writers for the publication include former leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn, and other members of the Socialist Campaign Group of Labour MPs such as Lloyd Russell-Moyle. Issues have contained interviews with international socialist politicians such as Deputy Prime Minister of Spain Pablo Iglesias and former Bolivian President Evo Morales.

In February 2021, in an interview on Novara Media, editor Ronan Burtenshaw announced that &quot;Tribune&quot; was being sued in a libel case. Though he did not comment on the nature of the case, he commented: &quot;It is not a case that has any substance, we are going to fight it and I think we are going to win it. I can&#x27;t say anymore, I am legally restricted from saying any more about it, it&#x27;s not related to the Labour Party before anybody goes on that tangent&quot;.

== Connections to the Labour Party==
=== Labour Party Conference ===
The magazine has historically hosted panels and rallies- or fringe events- at Labour Party Conference. In 2021 they invited Labour Party MP and SCG member Andy McDonald and US politician and organiser Nina Turner.

=== Tribune Group of MPs ===
The Tribune Group of Labour MPs was formed as a support group for the newspaper in 1964. During the 1960s and 1970s it was the main forum for the left in the Parliamentary Labour Party, but it split over Tony Benn&#x27;s bid for the deputy leadership of the party in 1981, with Benn&#x27;s supporters forming the Campaign Group (later the Socialist Campaign Group). During the 1980s the Tribune Group was the Labour soft left&#x27;s political caucus, but its closeness to the leadership of Neil Kinnock meant that it had lost any real &quot;raison d&#x27;etre&quot; by the early 1990s. It ceased to promote a list of candidates for shadow cabinet elections.

The group was reformed in 2005, led by Clive Efford, MP for Eltham. Invitations to join the newly reformed group were extended to backbench Labour MPs only. The group, which included former cabinet minister Yvette Cooper and former Labour policy coordinator Jon Cruddas, relaunched themselves in April 2017 aiming to reconnect with traditional Labour voters while also appealing to the centre ground. They supported &quot;opportunity and aspiration&quot; being central to the party&#x27;s programme, with policies supporting the &quot;security of its people at its heart&quot;. While not critical of then-leader Jeremy Corbyn, it was considered as a group of centre-left and moderate Labour MPs who would resist a left-wing successor being selected. The group has no connection with the current incarnation of the magazine. In 2018 it listed more than 70 MPs as members.

The group launched a new website in 2021, listing 78 MPs as members including Labour leader Keir Starmer.

<text>Coregonus lavaretus is a species of freshwater whitefish, in the family Salmonidae. It is the type species of its genus &quot;Coregonus&quot;.

There are widely different concepts about the delimitation of the species &quot;Coregonus lavaretus&quot; and about the number of species in the genus &quot;Coregonus&quot; in general.

==Lavaret==
In a narrow sense, &quot;Coregonus lavaretus&quot;, or the lavaret, is considered to be endemic
to Lake Bourget and Lake d&#x27;Aiguebelette in the Rhône river basin in France, whereas it formerly also occurred in Lake Geneva. According to this view there is a great number of distinct whitefish species in lakes, rivers and brackish waters of Central and Northern Europe.

==European whitefish (common whitefish)==

In the broad sense, &quot;Coregonus lavaretus&quot;, in English referred to as the common whitefish or European whitefish, is widespread from central and northwest Europe to Siberia. Often called the &quot;C. lavaretus&quot; complex and considered as a superspecies, it encompasses many of the whitefish populations suggested by others to be locally restricted species (such as the British powan and the gwyniad or the Alpine gravenche, as well as distinct intralacustrine morphs and populations characterized by different feeding habits, gill raker numbers, growth patterns and migration behaviour. Genetic studies suggest that the whitefish diversity within this complex is mostly of post-glacial origin. The resource polymorphism represented by the feeding morphs has evolved repeatedly and independently within individual lakes, and similar morphs in different lakes are not closely related to each other.

===Description===
There is much variation among the European whitefish forms, but in general they have a tapered body, a slightly protruding upper jaw and a fleshy dorsal fin that is typical of the salmon family. The snout is short and tapered, a fact that distinguishes this species from the two other North European &quot;Coregonus&quot; species, vendace (&quot;Coregonus albula&quot;) and the introduced peled (&quot;Coregonus peled&quot;). The former has a protuberant lower jaw while in the latter, the jaws are equal in length. The back is bluish green or brownish, the flanks silvery and the belly white. The fins are dark grey. This fish seldom grows more than long or exceeds in weight.

===Biology===
The European whitefish mostly feed on bottom-dwelling invertebrates or zooplankton. Larger fish also take insects off the surface of the water and eat fish fry. Breeding takes place in the autumn between September and November, largely depending on the water temperature. Different populations in the same sections of water may spawn at different times. Many populations in seas and lakes tend to make their way up-river to spawn, but others populations remain in lakes or the sea even when breeding.

== Houting ==
The houting (&quot;Coregonus oxyrhinchus&quot;) is a European species of whitefish in the family Salmonidae that was long thought extinct. It was native to the estuaries and rivers draining to the North Sea. The houting is distinguishable from other &quot;Coregonus&quot; taxa by having a long, pointed snout, an inferior mouth and a different number of gill rakers. The houting once occurred in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and England. In 2023, DNA analysis found the houting to be genetically indistinguishable from &quot;Coregonus lavaretus&quot;, and therefore not extinct.

=== Controversial status ===

There is controversy whether whitefish surviving in the southeastern North Sea sector of Denmark (Wadden Sea) and considered there as houting (Danish: &quot;snæbel&quot;) represent the same species as the houting that was extirpated from the more southwestern parts of the North Sea. Like the more southwestern population, the Danish North Sea population has a long, pointed snout and an inferior mouth, and it is anadromous, spending most of its adult life in coastal waters, but migrating into rivers to breed (some other European &quot;Coregonus&quot; occur in brackish water, but the ability to live long-term in full salt water is unique to the houting).

The Danish houting is genetically part of the widespread &quot;Coregonus lavaretus&quot; complex (including &quot;Coregonus maraena&quot; of the Baltic Sea basin; some prefer to include the Danish houting in this species), while its genetic relationship to the extinct population cannot be confirmed due to a lack of sufficient samples of the latter. Nevertheless, there are some minor differences in the genetics of the Danish houting compared to other living members in the &quot;C. lavaretus&quot; complex, as well as the differences in morphology and ecology, making it an evolutionarily significant unit. Hybridization and introgression between North Sea houting and its relatives is well-documented, and likely the result of translocations of &quot;Coregonus&quot; between different regions by humans. Some researchers argue that the morphological differences between different houting populations are not exceptional within the broader variation of the European whitefish, and probably no species-level extinction has taken place. The primary reason for treating the Danish houting and the extinct houting as separate are differences in the number of gill rakers (on average, the Danish has fewer than the extinct), but this number can vary extensively in &quot;Coregonus&quot;, even within a single population and species, and genetic studies of &quot;Coregonus&quot; have shown that gill rakers are of limited use in predicting relationship among populations. Some think that the morphological differences in number of gill rakers are sufficient for treating them as separate, and that the last true houting was caught in the lower Rhine in 1940. Studies in the early 2000s (decade) indicated that there was no overlap in the possible number of gill rakers of the two (28–35 in the Danish; 38–46 in the extinct), but later reviews have shown that there is an overlap (up to 41 has been found in the Elbe, a reintroduced population based on Danish houting).

A €13 million restoration project of the Danish houting, partly funded by the European Union&#x27;s LIFE programme and the Danish Natural Agency, was undertaken in 2005–2013, and there is ongoing monitoring of the species and regulation of the fish-eating great cormorant from important locations. As of 2019, a total of more than €20 million has been used on its conservation, with almost two-thirds funded by Denmark and the remaining by the European Union. However, the only remaining fully natural and significant population of Danish houting is in the Vidå River, estimated in 2014 to consist of about 3,500 adults. Little is known about its exact spawning and juvenile requirements, and despite the earlier project it was still declining, leading to fears that it could become fully extinct unless more is done to preserve it. After years with a downward trend in its numbers, an increase to about 4,000 adult Danish houtings was registered in 2018–19, with most individuals in the Vidå and fewer in (both populations increasing).

Individuals from the Danish population have been used as a basis for re-establishing houting in the Eider, Elbe (both indisputably a natural part of the range) and Rhine (arguably non-native, if the extinct is recognized as a separate species). On the 24th of October 2023 researchers of the Research Institute for Nature and Forest in Belgium captured a live specimen in the Scheldt river in Kruibeke, while the species was thought to be extinct in the country for over 100 years. Possibly the specimen migrated there from the Rhine population. In Annex II of the EC Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), a species listed as &quot;Coregonus oxyrhynchus&quot; is protected for &#x27;anadromous populations in certain sectors of the North Sea&#x27;

In 2023, DNA analysis found the houting to be genetically indistinguishable from &quot;Coregonus lavaretus&quot;, and therefore not extinct.

<doc id="415117" wikidata="Q4707771" url="?curid=415117" title="Alan Simpson (British politician)">
<text>Alan John Simpson (born 20 September 1948) is a British former Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Nottingham South from 1992 to 2010.

==Early life==
Simpson attended Bootle Grammar School for Boys and studied economics at Trent Polytechnic, where he was President of the Student Union from 1969 to 1970. After graduating in 1972, he became a community worker, holding the post of Assistant General Secretary at the Nottingham Council of Voluntary Service from 1970 to 1974, and working on an anti-vandalism project from 1974 to 1978. He later became a research officer for the city&#x27;s Racial Equality Council from 1979 to 1992.

He joined the Labour Party in 1973 and was elected a county councillor in 1985. He first contested his eventual seat in 1987.

== Parliamentary career ==
Simpson is on the left-wing of the Labour Party. He was a member (and latterly treasurer) of the Socialist Campaign Group of MPs, as well as being on the board of the left-wing &quot;Tribune&quot; magazine. Simpson&#x27;s opinions ran counter to those of the Labour frontbench: in the mid-1990s, he led the campaign to retain the original wording of Clause IV, and later established the &quot;Labour Against the War&quot; group, which opposed the Afghan war and occupation of Iraq.

On 31 October 2006, Simpson was among the 12 Labour MPs to back Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party&#x27;s call for an inquiry into the Iraq War.

On 18 February 2007, Simpson announced his intention to stand down at the next general election. In a letter to his constituency party members, he felt his effectiveness would be greater outside parliament campaigning for radical environmental policy changes, rather than remaining on the back benches. Another factor behind his decision was the birth in 2006 of a baby daughter with his third wife.

==Expenses controversy==
Simpson was asked to pay back £500 that he was accused of over-claiming in cleaning bills by the auditor of MPs&#x27; expenses, Thomas Legg. Legg has been openly challenged by Simpson who refuses to return the money. Simpson threatened to take Legg to court over this matter.

==Personal life==
Simpson married Pascale Quiviger, a French-Canadian author and painter, in July 2005 at Newstead Abbey, the ancestral home of Lord Byron. They have a daughter born in January 2006. He has two sons and a daughter from a previous marriage.

<doc id="415121" wikidata="Q7182378" url="?curid=415121" title="Phil Sawford">
<text>Philip Andrew Sawford (born 26 June 1950) is a British politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Kettering from 1997 to 2005. A member of the Labour Party, he was Leader of Kettering Borough Council from 1991 to 1997.

==Early life and career==
Sawford was born in Loddington, a small Northamptonshire village west of Kettering, on 26 June 1950. He was educated at Loddington Church of England Primary School and Kettering Grammar School. Sawford became an apprentice carpenter, and worked as a steelworker from 1977 until the closures and mass redundancies at Corby Steelworks in 1980. 

He gained a Diploma at Ruskin College, Oxford in 1982, and later gained a BA degree from the University of Leicester in 1985. Sawford forged a career in training and personnel development, working for a training partnership in Wellingborough from 1985 to 1997. 

== Local government career ==
Sawford was first elected to public office as a Member of Desborough Town Council in 1977 and became Chair in 1984. He went on to represent Loatland ward on Kettering Borough Council from 1980. Sawford was elected leader of the borough council following the 1991 local elections, when Labour became the largest party. He continued to serve in the role when they won an overall majority in 1995, but stood down from the Borough and Town councils after his election to Parliament in 1997.

Sawford returned to elected office as a Member of Desborough Town Council in 2018, and became Chair once again in 2021.

==Parliamentary career==
Sawford stood as the Labour candidate for Wellingborough at the 1992 general election, but lost to the Conservative incumbent Peter Fry despite a swing towards Labour.

He unexpectedly won the Kettering constituency at the 1997 general election, defeating Conservative Cabinet minister Roger Freeman. Sawford won with a majority of 189 after three recounts, which meant the election result was one of the last to declare. He narrowly increased his majority to 665 at the 2001 general election. He was a member of the Environmental Audit Committee from 2000 to 2001 and the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee from 2001 to 2003.

Sawford is considered to be on the left of the Labour Party and was a member of the Socialist Campaign Group whilst an MP. He was a sworn republican, an outspoken campaigner for the abolition of hunting, and an opponent of the invasion of Iraq in 2003. He frequently rebelled against the New Labour government.

Sawford was defeated by Conservative Philip Hollobone at the 2005 election, in line with the national swing against Labour. In 2007, he was re-selected to contest Kettering for Labour at the next general election. Constituency boundary changes implemented at the 2010 general election gave the seat a notional Labour majority, but Sawford was again defeated by Hollobone with an increased majority of almost 20 percentage points.

==Personal life==
He married Rosemary Stokes on 1 May 1971, with whom he had sons Andy and Lee. Andy served as Labour MP for Corby, a neighbouring constituency to Kettering, from a by-election in 2012 until 2015.

<text>Christopher John Mullin (born 12 December 1947) is a British journalist, author and Labour politician.

As a journalist in the 1980s, Chris Mullin led a campaign that resulted in the release of the Birmingham Six, victims of a miscarriage of justice. In March 2022, a court case settled that Mullin would not need to release any notes relating to who may have planted the two bombs. Mullin is the author of four novels, including &quot;A Very British Coup&quot; (1982), which was later adapted for television, and its sequel &quot;The Friends of Harry Perkins&quot;. Mullin is also a celebrated diarist.

Mullin was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Sunderland South from 1987 until 2010. In Parliament, he served as Chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee and as a Minister in the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and in the Department for International Development.

==Early life==

Mullin is the son of a Scottish Protestant father and an Irish Catholic mother, both of whom worked for Marconi. Mullin was educated at St Joseph&#x27;s College, a Roman Catholic boarding independent school for boys (now co-educational) in the town of Ipswich in Suffolk, followed by the University of Hull, where he studied Law. He joined the Labour Party after his politics shifted leftward in response to the Vietnam War.

==Journalist and activist==

Before being elected as an MP, Mullin was a journalist, training with the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. In this period Mullin travelled to Russia and China. From there, his first main activity as a journalist came in the Vietnam War. He has been highly critical of the American strategy in Vietnam and has stated that he believes that the war, intended to stop the advance of Communism, instead only delayed the coming of market forces in the country. Mullin also reported from Cambodia in 1973 and 1980.

===Birmingham Six===

Mullin, working for the Granada current affairs programme &quot;World in Action&quot;, was pivotal in securing the release of the Birmingham Six, a long-standing miscarriage of justice. In 1985, the first of several World in Action programmes casting doubt on the men&#x27;s convictions was broadcast. In 1986, Mullin&#x27;s book, &quot;Error of Judgment: The Truth About the Birmingham Pub Bombings&quot;, set out a detailed case supporting the men&#x27;s claims that they were innocent. It included his claim to have traced and interviewed those who were actually responsible for the bombings. It was described the writer Sebastian Faulks as, &#x27;one of the greatest feats ever achieved by an investigative journalist&#x27;. In 2024 Mullin published an updated edition of Error of Judgement which included the names of three of the four men responsible for the bombings.

In March 1990, ITV broadcast the Granada Television documentary drama, &quot;Who Bombed Birmingham?&quot;, which re-enacted the bombings and subsequent key events in Mullin&#x27;s campaign. Written by Rob Ritchie and directed by Mike Beckham, it featured John Hurt as Mullin, with Martin Shaw as &quot;World in Action&quot; producer Ian McBride, Ciaran Hinds as Richard McIlkenny, one of the Six, and Patrick Malahide as Michael Mansfield (QC). It was repackaged for export as &quot;The Investigation – Inside a Terrorist Bombing&quot;, and first shown on American television on 22 April 1990. Granada&#x27;s BAFTA-nominated follow-up documentary after the release of the six men, &quot;World in Action Special: The Birmingham Six – Their Own Story&quot;, was telecast on 18 March 1991.

In 2019, Mullin was criticised by the relatives of some of the victims of the attack for not naming IRA bombing suspects who he met whilst investigating the case in the 1980s. Mullin was called &quot;scum&quot; and a &quot;disgrace&quot;. Mullin has defended this decision on the grounds of journalistic ethics. He was quoted in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as having said: &quot;In order to track down the bombers, I had to give assurances not only to guilty but to innocent intermediaries that I would not, during their lifetime, disclose the names of those who cooperated. Had I not done so, no one would have cooperated&quot;.

===Bennism and &quot;Tribune&quot;===
Mullin edited two collections of Tony Benn&#x27;s speeches and writings, &quot;Arguments for Socialism&quot; (1979) and &quot;Arguments for Democracy&quot; (1981), and, as editor of the left-wing weekly &quot;Tribune&quot; from 1982 to 1984, provided effective support for Benn and his ideas. Mullin also sought to turn &quot;Tribune&quot; into a readers&#x27; cooperative, to its shareholders&#x27; chagrin.

==Novelist==
Mullin has published a total of four novels. His first novel was &quot;A Very British Coup&quot;, published in 1982, which portrays the destabilisation of a left-wing British government by the forces of the Establishment. He wrote it having discussed the idea of a left-wing Prime Minister being undermined by the Establishment following the 1981 Labour Party Conference with Peter Hain, Stuart Holland and Tony Banks. Holland revealed in this discussion that he had written a number of chapters in a potential novel containing this story and that Hain had contacted publishers regarding the possibility of a similar novel. Subsequently, Mullin was told by the former BBC correspondent Peter Hardiman Scott that he had been writing a book on this topic at the time.

The novel was adapted for television by Alan Plater, with substantial alterations to the plot, and screened in 1988. The screenwriter was Alan Plater and it was directed by Mick Jackson. Starring Ray McAnally, the series was first screened on Channel 4 and won Bafta and Emmy awards, and was syndicated to more than 30 countries. The book was also the basis for the 2012 four-part Channel 4 series, &quot;Secret State&quot;. Starring Gabriel Byrne, this version was written by Robert Jones. Mullin later wrote a sequel to &quot;A Very British Coup&quot; called &quot;The Friends of Harry Perkins&quot; which was published in 2019. The book explores Brexit and American–Chinese relations amongst other topics.

Mullin also published &quot;The Last Man Out of Saigon&quot; in 1986 featuring a plot in which a CIA agent sent into Vietnam in the last week of the war to set up a network of agents and also &quot;The Year of the Fire Monkey&quot;, a thriller about a CIA attempt to assassinate Chairman Mao using a Tibetan agent, in 1991.

==Political career==

===Early political career===
Mullin stood unsuccessfully in the 1970 general election against Liberal Leader Jeremy Thorpe in North Devon. Mullin also fought Kingston-upon-Thames in February 1974.

By 1980, he was an executive member of the Labour Co-ordinating Committee. Mullin was also on the executive of the influential Campaign for Labour Party Democracy. As such he was an active supporter of Tony Benn when, in 1981, disregarding an appeal from party leader Michael Foot to abstain from inflaming the party&#x27;s divisions, Benn stood against the incumbent Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, Denis Healey. In addition Mullin edited two collections of Benn&#x27;s speeches and writings &quot;Arguments for Socialism&quot; (1979) and &quot;Arguments for Democracy&quot; (1981). He was widely regarded as a leading &#x27;Bennite&#x27;, a highly influential movement within the Labour Party in the early 1980s.

===Parliament===
Mullin was first elected MP for Sunderland South in 1987, and was returned at every subsequent election up to and including 2005. His constituency was the first to declare in every general election between 1992 and his standing down in 2010 (1992, 1997, 2001 and 2005). Mullin joked about being the UK&#x27;s sole MP for half an hour and muses about forming a government. He did not seek re-election in 2010. Mullin was on the left of the party and his selection for Sunderland South (occasioned by the retirement of Gordon Bagier MP) met with the disapproval of Neil Kinnock, at the time the Leader of the Labour Party. In the late 1980s, the right-wing, tabloid press targeted Mullin for his left-wing views frequently. Headlines included: &#x27;Kinnock&#x27;s Top Ten Loony Tunes (Mullin was no. 8),&#x27;Loony MP back Bomb Gang&#x27; (Sun, Jan 29, 1988) &#x27;20 things you didn&#x27;t know about crackpot Chris&quot; (The Sun) and &quot;Mr Odious&quot; {@ {Sun, January 1989)}

Having reported from Cambodia in 1973 and 1980, in 1990 he was outspoken on the British Government&#x27;s record in Cambodia, being a leading voice in some of the first protracted debates on Britain&#x27;s provision of clandestine military support to Khmer terrorists, allied to the Khmer Rouge. and attributing increasing public interest in the issue to the documentary films of John Pilger.

He was a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, Secretary of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Vietnam, a member of the All-Party Group on Tibet and Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Cambodia, Member of the Home Affairs Select committee (1992–97), and Chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee from 1997 to 1999 and again from 2001 to 2003. In 2009-10 he was a member of the Parliamentary Reform Committee which among other things recommended that the appointment of select committee chairs should be by election rather than appointment. A reform that was subsequently implemented.

===In government===
Despite occasional criticism of the government, he replaced Alan Meale as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of the Environment, Transport, and the Regions in July 1999 before taking over from George Foulkes as Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Department for International Development in 2001.

Despite having voted against the Iraq war, he returned to government in June 2003, as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in charge of Africa, but after the 2005 election again returned to the backbenches. Before the Labour victory of 1997, Mullin had attained a reputation for campaigning on behalf of victims of injustice and opposition to the curtailing of civil rights. His campaigning stance had to change while a minister because of the collective responsibility of government. His vote against the government&#x27;s proposal for 90 days&#x27; detention without trial for persons suspected of terrorism, as one of 49 Labour rebels, seemed to indicate a re-emergence of his civil libertarian instincts. Mullin criticised the Labour government&#x27;s rotation of Ministers expressing his belief that the Blair Government changed Ministers too often and noted this in his final speech to the House of Commons.

After leaving government, Mullin also voted against the United Kingdom maintaining a nuclear deterrent.

===Expenses claims===
During the UK Parliamentary expenses scandal, Mullin, one of the lowest claimers, provided some comic relief when it was revealed that the television at his second home is a very old black-and-white model with a £45 TV licence.

===Leaving parliament===
On 10 May 2008, the &quot;Sunderland Echo&quot; site reported that Mullin had decided to stand down at the 2010 general election.&#x27;Better to go while people are still asking why, rather than when&#x27;. Soon after retiring he moved to a cottage in a walled garden in Northumberland which he restored. It featured on Gardener&#x27;s World in August 2016. In 2011 he was a judge of the Man Booker Prize. From 2011 to 2017 he was chair of the Heritage Lottery Fund in the North East. In 2017 he was appointed to the Northumberland National Park Authority. In 2023 he was appointed to chair the board of the Tyne and Wear Museums. He is also a trustee of the Chillingham Wild Cattle Association.

===Diaries===

Mullin published four volumes of widely praised diaries. The first three documented the rise and fall of New Labour from the death of the party leader John Smith in 1994 to the 2010 general election: &quot;A View from the Foothills&quot; (2009) (recounting Mullin&#x27;s ministerial career from 1999–2005), &quot;Decline &amp; Fall: Diaries 2005–2010&quot; (2010) and &quot;A Walk-On Part: Diaries 1994–1999&quot; (2011). Among other things, Mullin recorded his gradual disillusion with the Labour Party&#x27;s left wing and his rather reluctant support, after Smith&#x27;s death, for fellow North-Eastern MP Tony Blair (whom he dubbed &quot;The Man&quot;) as the person most likely to lead the party back to power. He admired Blair as a leader and for his capacity to create a broad-based Labour Party. In spite of Iraq, Mullin remains an admirer of Blair, viewing him as a leader of exceptional ability. Peter Riddell of the &quot;Times&quot; suggested that &quot;A View From the Foothills&quot; deserved to become &quot;the central text for understanding the Blair years&quot;, while &quot;Decline &amp; Fall&quot;, in which Mullin (by then a backbencher again) expressed wry consternation at the way the government operated under Blair&#x27;s successor Gordon Brown, were commended for their independence of outlook, revealing, as Jenni Russell put it in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, Mullin&#x27;s &quot;readiness to like people who don&#x27;t echo his politics&quot;.

The first three volumes were adapted for the stage by Michael Chaplin as &quot;A Walk on Part&quot;. It premiered at the Live Theatre in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in May 2011, before moving to the Soho Theatre in London. Mullin regularly gives talks on his diaries, politics and the rise and fall of New Labour.

The fourth volume, &quot;Didn’t You Use to Be Chris Mullin? Diaries 2010–2022&quot;, chronicling the post-parliamentary period of his life, from the fallout of the 2010 general election to the death of Queen Elizabeth II, was released in May 2023.

==Personal life==
Mullin and his wife, Nguyen Thi Ngoc, who he met while in Vietnam,&lt;ref name=&quot;ncl.ac/ChrisMullin&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; married in April 1987, in Ho Chi Minh City,&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian/mp-family&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; had two daughters, and live in Northumberland. His hobbies include gardening.

In football he supports Sunderland A.F.C., and mentioned it in the May 1997 State Opening of Parliament speech.

==Academic honours==

On 28 January 2011, his &quot;alma mater&quot;, Hull University, awarded him an honorary Doctorate in Law, in recognition of his achievements. In December 2011, Newcastle University awarded Chris Mullin an honorary degree. Mullin also taught a module at Newcastle University called &#x27;The Rise and Fall of New Labour&#x27;. He was also awarded an honorary degree by the University of Essex in 2011. Mullin has also received honorary degrees from the University of Sunderland (2010) and City University London (1992).

<text>Viação Aérea São Paulo S/A (São Paulo Airways), better known as VASP, was an airline with its head office in the VASP Building on the grounds of São Paulo–Congonhas Airport in São Paulo, Brazil. It had main bases at São Paulo&#x27;s two major airports, São Paulo–Congonhas Airport (CGH) and São Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport (GRU).

==History==


The airline was established on 4 November 1933 by the state government of São Paulo and started operations on 12 November 1933. VASP was the first airline to serve the interior of the state of São Paulo (São Paulo-São Carlos-São José do Rio Preto and São Paulo-Ribeirão Preto-Uberaba), with two Monospar ST-4. At the start of the 1930s, it was the only carrier to operate with land planes in their service area. At the time this was a real exploit due to the lack of adequate non-coastal airports. Many landing strips were improvised in flat pastures. This insistence on using only land planes led to the building in 1936 of one of the country&#x27;s most important airports, Congonhas, located in the city of São Paulo, far from the coast. During its early years, Congonhas Airport was popularly known as &quot;Campo da VASP&quot; (&quot;VASP&#x27;s airfield&quot;).

In 1939, VASP bought Aerolloyd Iguassu, which included also a license to operate flights to the states of Paraná and Santa Catarina. In 1962, VASP became a national airline when it acquired Lóide Aéreo Nacional, and with it its license to operate nationwide.

On 6 July 1959, VASP, Cruzeiro do Sul and Varig initiated the air shuttle services between Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont and São Paulo-Congonhas airports, the first of its kind in the world. The three companies coordinated their schedules, operations, and shared revenue. The service was a direct response to the competition imposed by Real Transportes Aéreos. The idea, baptized as Air Bridge ( in Portuguese), was inspired by the Berlin Airlift. It was so successful that it was abandoned only in 1999. Flights operated on an hourly basis initially by Convair 240 (Varig), Convair 340 (Cruzeiro) and Saab 90 Scandia (VASP). In a matter of a few months, the shuttle service led by Varig won the battle against Real, which was anyway bought by Varig in 1961. Sadia Transportes Aéreos joined the service in 1968. Between 1975 and 1992, it was operated exclusively by Varig&#x27;s Lockheed L-188 Electra, which for sometime and for the sake of neutrality did not have the name Varig on the fuselage.

Although it had been remarkably well-run for most of its life as a state-owned company, by the 1980s VASP was being plagued by inefficiency, losses covered by state capital injections, and a bloated payroll for political reasons. Under the Brazilian government&#x27;s neoliberal policies newly introduced at the time, VASP was privatized in 1990. A majority stake was bought by the VOE/Canhedo Group, a company formed by the Canhedo Group of Brasília and VASP employees.

Under the command of its new owner and president, Wagner Canhedo, VASP quickly expanded operations in the country, and created international routes. Until VASP&#x27;s entry into the international market, Varig had, for all intents and purposes, been Brazil&#x27;s sole international airline since 1965. However, after many years of mismanagement, financial losses, soaring debt and bad credit, in 2002 it cancelled all of its international operations to concentrate in the domestic market. By that time, VASP had plummeted from the second to the fourth position in the Brazilian airline market, flying an aging fleet of Boeing 737s (most of them of the obsolete −200 series) and Airbus A300s.

The company faced its worst crisis in 2004 as new airlines such rise in the country, which led to the suspension of service to many Brazilian cities and the cancellation of flights. As a result, the airline had its domestic market share reduced to 10%. On 27 January 2005, Brazil&#x27;s then civil aviation regulator, DAC, grounded the airline from operating scheduled services pending a financial investigation. VASP was allowed to operate charter services until April 2005, giving it a chance to prove its financial stability in order to retain its air operator certificate.

By December 2007, the once-proud company had stopped flying altogether, and was reduced to providing maintenance services to other airlines. Even during the worst of VASP&#x27;s troubles, its maintenance expertise and personnel had always been held in high regard. It had been operating under the new Brazilian bankruptcy law since July 2006, and had its recovery plan approved on 27 August 2006. However, in 2008 it declared bankruptcy.

As of October 2020, nine of the company&#x27;s planes (seven Boeing 737-200s and two Airbus A300s) are still grounded at Congonhas-São Paulo Airport since 2005 and by now badly weathered and dilapidated, began to be dismantled and sold for scrap at auction. Each plane in its current condition was estimated to be worth only 30,000 to 50,000 real (approximately $20,000 to 33,000 US dollars), considerably less than even its monthly parking and storage fees. The company&#x27;s fleet of 27 planes had been also grounded in similar circumstances since 2005 at various Brazilian airports.

==Services==
===Services at time of closure===
VASP operated services to the following domestic scheduled destinations (as of January 2005): Aracaju, Belém, Brasília, Curitiba, Fortaleza, Foz do Iguaçu, Maceió, Manaus, Natal, Recife, Rio de Janeiro–Galeão, Rio de Janeiro–Santos Dumont, Salvador, São Luís, São Paulo–Congonhas, São Paulo–Guarulhos, Teresina and Porto Alegre.

===Services ended before closure===
VASP once had a much more extensive network, which covered virtually every major Brazilian city with an airport and in the 1990s included such international destinations as: Buenos Aires–Ezeiza, Quito, Miami, New York–JFK, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto–Pearson, Seoul–Gimpo, Casablanca, Barcelona, Lisbon, Brussels, Osaka–Kansai, Athens, Frankfurt and Zürich.

==Fleet==

===Fleet history===
Over the years, the fleet of VASP consisted of the following aircraft:

===Fleet in 1970===
==VASPEX==
VASPEX was the company&#x27;s subsidiary for immediate dispatch of correspondence, documents and objects. It filed for bankruptcy, but ended up going bankrupt with VASP on September 4, 2008. It operated the Boeing 727 and 737-200 for almost all of Brazil. It was created to operate together with VASP delivering orders of the type.

===VASPEX fleet===
==Curiosities==
The 3rd ex-VASP B737, the first operator of the legendary Boeing model in Brazil, is today at Auto Shopping Só Marcas, in the city of Contagem, almost on the border with Belo Horizonte. With the old license plate PP-SMC, this B737-200 was manufactured in 1969 and flew exclusively on the former VASP, until the company closed, staying at Congonhas Airport for several years, until it was auctioned and bought by the owner of the shopping center and other enterprises.

This plane has been the scene of several events and was even used during a political propaganda by the Workers&#x27; Party - PT in 2022. It was also in evidence because of a girl who filled it with World Cup stickers. Despite the political and football art, and now graffiti, the plane itself was not painted, but gained a cover around it, which receives the art related to the events that take place on the top floor of the used car shopping centre.

The last so-called artistic intervention was by Red Room, a production company that took German DJ Emanuel Satie to the capital of Minas Gerais, as well as Brazilian DJ Jessica Brankka. The B737 was the backdrop for a sunset event on March 18, 2023. The idea was for the jet to make a composition with the DJs, who played until 6 am.

<text>John Martin McDonnell (born 8 September 1951) is a British politician who served as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2015 to 2020. He has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Hayes and Harlington since 1997, representing the Labour Party until the whip was withdrawn and his suspension on 23 July 2024 as a result of voting to scrap the two child benefit cap. On the political left, McDonnell is a member of the Socialist Campaign Group. 

He stood for the position of Labour Party leader following Tony Blair&#x27;s resignation in 2007, but failed to reach the required number of nominations. He was a candidate for the party leadership again in 2010 following Gordon Brown&#x27;s resignation after Labour&#x27;s electoral defeat, but withdrew in favour of Diane Abbott, feeling that he would be unable to secure enough nominations.

Alongside Jeremy Corbyn, McDonnell has been seen as a major figure on the left-wing of the party. After being elected Labour leader in 2015, Corbyn appointed McDonnell to his Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer. As Shadow Chancellor, McDonnell pledged to increase spending on infrastructure and research, describing his vision for the economy as &quot;socialism with an iPad&quot;.

==Early life==
McDonnell was born in Liverpool to a family with an Irish Catholic background. His father, Bob, was a docker who also served as a sergeant in the Sherwood Foresters during World War II, whilst his mother Elsie worked as a cleaner. He moved with his family to his mother&#x27;s hometown, Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, when he was very young as his father was unable to find work at the docks; his father became a bus driver and was a branch secretary of the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union and his mother worked for British Home Stores. McDonnell attended Great Yarmouth Grammar School. McDonnell received a Local Authority grant to attend St Joseph&#x27;s College, Ipswich, a Roman Catholic boarding fee-paying independent school for boys (now co-educational). &quot; McDonnell is now irreligious, but refers to himself as a &quot;cultural Catholic&quot; and is a regular churchgoer.

McDonnell failed his A-levels at grammar school, partly due to holding down part-time jobs in bars and a bingo hall. Upon leaving education, McDonnell held a series of unskilled jobs. After marrying his first wife, he returned to A-level studies at night school at Burnley Technical College, and at the age of 23, he moved to Hayes in Greater London, attended Brunel University, and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in government and politics. During this period, he helped his wife run a small children&#x27;s home in Hayes, and was active on behalf of his local community and for National Union of Public Employees. After completing his master&#x27;s degree in politics and sociology at Birkbeck, University of London, he became a researcher and official with the National Union of Mineworkers from 1977 to 1978, and later the Trades Union Congress from 1978 until 1982. From 1985 to 1987, McDonnell was head of the policy unit at Camden Borough Council, then chief executive of the Association of London Authorities from 1987 to 1995, and the Association of London Government from 1995 until 1997.

==Greater London Council (1981–1986)==
In 1981, McDonnell was elected to the Greater London Council (GLC) as the member for Hayes and Harlington. He became the GLC&#x27;s chair of finance and deputy leader to Ken Livingstone, who described him as having an &quot;absolute grasp for detail and every year he produced a balanced budget, no borrowing&quot;. He was sacked by Livingstone in 1985 over the strategy to oppose rate-capping—Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government had capped council rates (now called council tax), an action which the GLC had claimed, based on figures calculated by McDonnell, would lead to £135 million in cuts. However, Livingstone claimed in his autobiography to have found that the authority could actually still increase spending and cap the rates; Livingstone said that McDonnell had &#x27;exaggerated&#x27; spending figures to support his case that the GLC had to ignore the rates cap, and that he confronted McDonnell, saying &quot;If these figures are right we&#x27;re going to look like the biggest fucking liars since Goebbels.&quot; McDonnell described Livingstone&#x27;s account as &quot;complete fiction&quot;.

In an interview with Ronan Bennett for &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, McDonnell described his role during this time as being &quot;to translate policies into concrete realities on the ground.&quot; He further discussed his performance by indicating, &quot;I was a fairly hard-nosed administrator. We set in train policies for which we were attacked from all sides but are now accepted as mainstream: large-scale investment in public services; raising the issue of Ireland and arguing for a dialogue for peace; equal opportunities; police accountability. We set up a women&#x27;s committee, an ethnic minorities committee.&quot;

==After the GLC (1986–1997)==
Following the abolition of the GLC in 1986, McDonnell was employed as head of the policy unit at Camden London Borough Council. In 1987, he became Chief Executive of the Association of London Authorities (eventually the Association of London Government), where he represented all the London boroughs in their relations with central government and Europe. Having previously unsuccessfully contested Hampstead and Highgate in 1983, McDonnell fought for his home constituency of Hayes and Harlington at the 1992 general election, but lost by 53 votes, after three recounts, to the Conservative incumbent, Terry Dicks. During the campaign, Dicks sued for libel over critical material in McDonnell&#x27;s campaign leaflets; McDonnell settled and paid Dicks damages of £15,000 plus legal costs of £55,000. McDonnell would later refer to Dicks as a &#x27;stain&#x27; on the character of the House of Commons and a stain on the Conservative Party, and a &#x27;malignant creature&#x27; during his maiden parliamentary speech.

==Parliamentary backbencher (1997–2015)==
When Terry Dicks then stood down, McDonnell became the MP for Hayes and Harlington at the 1997 general election, with 62 per cent of the vote and a majority of over 14,000. He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 6 June 1997, where he notably launched a scathing attack against his predecessor, against parliamentary tradition. He has been involved in several local community campaigns, including one opposing the expansion of Heathrow Airport and its impact on local communities. He opposed New Labour policies of the Iraq War, foundation hospitals, student top-up fees, trust schools and anti-terror laws. When Ken Livingstone was elected Mayor of London, as an independent in 2000, he appointed McDonnell to his cabinet with responsibility for local government in London.

===Iraq War===
McDonnell voted against the 2003 Iraq War, stating in 2007: In October 2006, McDonnell was one of 12 Labour MPs to back Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party&#x27;s call for a parliamentary inquiry into the war in Iraq.

===Irish Republican Army===
In May 2003, he made controversial comments about the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), saying:

Threatened with expulsion from the Labour Party, he went on to offer a rationale for his comments in an article written for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in June 2003 (&quot;Expulsion would be an odd reward for telling hard truths&quot;), stating:

According to a report in &quot;The Times&quot; published in November 2015, McDonnell had made similar comments at a Labour Committee on Ireland meeting in 1985, before the start of the Northern Ireland peace process. The &quot;Deptford Mercury&quot; asserted at the time that McDonnell had suggested there was a role for &quot;the ballot, the bullet and the bomb&quot; in achieving a United Ireland, and joked about &quot;kneecapping&quot; the &quot;gutless wimp&quot; Labour councillors who had declined to join the meeting.

In September 2015, McDonnell apologised on the BBC television programme &quot;Question Time&quot; for any offence caused by his remarks on the IRA. He said that his remarks in 2003 had been an attempt to persuade republicans to support the peace process and to afford the IRA the opportunity to disarm without humiliation stating: &quot;There was a real risk of the Republican movement splitting and some of them continuing the armed process.&quot;

In his study at Hayes, McDonnell has a plaque presented to him by Gerry Kelly dedicated to the &quot;H-Block Martyrs 1981&quot;, referring to those who died during the 1981 Irish hunger strike. A spokesman for McDonnell said the plaque &quot;merely commemorates the peaceful protest in prison, not the prior actions of those involved&quot;.

===Groups and campaigns in Parliament===
McDonnell is a leading member of several all-party groups within Parliament, including groups representing individual trade unions, such as the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) and justice unions such as NAPO. He is also a leading member of groups on a wide range of issues such as Britain&#x27;s Irish community, the Punjabi community, endometriosis, and Kenya. McDonnell is a member of the Labour Land Campaign, which advocates introducing a land value tax.

McDonnell chairs the Labour Representation Committee (LRC), a left-wing group of Labour activists, local parties, trade unions and MPs that campaigns for the adoption of a raft of socialist policies by the Labour Government. The group was founded on Saturday, 3 July 2004, and currently has more than 800 members and 90 affiliates. He also chairs the Public Services Not Private Profit, an anti-privatisation campaign that brings together sixteen trade unions and several campaigning organisations, such as the World Development Movement, Defend Council Housing and the National Pensioners Convention. An early day motion in support of the campaign attracted more than ninety MPs. The campaign held a mass rally and lobby of Parliament on 27 June 2006, which was attended by more than 2,000 trade unionists.

===Economic policy===
In 2006, McDonnell said that &quot;Marx, Lenin and Trotsky&quot; were his &quot;most significant&quot; intellectual influences. Footage emerged of McDonnell in 2013 talking about the 2008 financial crisis and stating, &quot;I&#x27;ve been waiting for this for a generation! We&#x27;ve got to demand systemic change. Look, I&#x27;m straight, I&#x27;m honest with people: I&#x27;m a Marxist.&quot; He was accused of celebrating the financial crisis of 2007–2008; McDonnell denied the allegation and claimed he was &quot;joking&quot;. During an interview with Andrew Marr when the footage was played and McDonnell was asked, &quot;Are you a Marxist?&quot;, he replied: &quot;I believe there&#x27;s a lot to learn from reading &quot;&quot;, yes of course there is, and that&#x27;s been recommended not just by me but many others, mainstream economists as well.&quot; In 2018, McDonnell attended the Marx 200 conference, where he said, &quot;Marxism is about the freedom of spirit, the development of life chances, the enhancement of democracy.&quot; In 2019, McDonnell stated during an interview that Marx&#x27;s &quot;Kapital&quot; is &quot;one of the important analyses of the modern capitalist system&quot;.

====Public services====
McDonnell has consistently opposed the privatisation of public services and chaired the Public Services not Private Profit Campaign launched in 2006 and supported by sixteen trade unions linking up with students, pensioners, health campaigners and the World Development Movement.

McDonnell is &quot;not supportive of PFI schemes&quot;, declaring that he has &quot;opposed every PFI scheme that was proposed&quot;. In 2006, during the parliamentary debate on the Budget Resolutions, McDonnell warned against public-private finance initiatives (PFIs), calling for an inquiry:There are numerous examples. I refer hon. Members to the work of Alison Pollock and to the publications by Unison in recent months, which contain example after example in the public services, health and education where PFI has been used to exploit the public purse, has failed to deliver and has delivered large bonuses and profits to individual company directors. That is why I regret that the Chancellor is going along that line. I would welcome a Government inquiry into PFI, which would probably echo the work done by the Public Accounts Committee on individual PFI schemes, which has demonstrated their lack of deliverability and cost effectiveness.

====Tax transparency====
Throughout his time in Parliament, McDonnell has championed the cause of tax justice, hosting the launch of the Tax Justice Network in 2003.

In 2002, McDonnell worked with William Campbell-Taylor and Maurice Glasman, who challenged a bill concerned with the City of London Corporation in relation to alleged tax avoidance:Apart from a couple of brave, independent-minded Labour MPs, notably John McDonnell, nobody supported Glasman and Campbell-Taylor to challenge the bill. Such is the fear that the corporation inspires in parliament.

====Bank regulations====
During the 2011 Budget Resolutions, McDonnell highlighted his long-term consistent work calling for better regulation of the banking and finance sector:We seem to forget that the cause of that crisis was the cause of this crisis—speculation by the banks and other speculators and, yes, a Government who failed to regulate. I have to say, however, that when a number of Members called for bank regulation in this House, there was an element of quietude on all sides. I remember fighting for four years, in almost a solitary capacity, to secure the passage of the City of London (Ward Elections) Bill at a time when we were pressing for regulation.

====Anti-austerity====
In February 2013, McDonnell was among those who supported the People&#x27;s Assembly Against Austerity in a letter published by &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

===Heathrow Airport expansion===

McDonnell has been a vocal opponent of plans to expand Heathrow Airport with a third runway—the proposed site lies within his constituency. During a debate on the expansion of the airport on 15 January 2009, he was suspended for five days by Deputy Speaker Alan Haselhurst after disrupting Commons proceedings. McDonnell picked up the ceremonial mace and placed it down on an empty bench in the Commons while shouting that the lack of a vote on the third runway was &quot;a disgrace to the democracy of this country.&quot;

===Armed police and MI5===
In 2015, McDonnell&#x27;s name appeared on a letter calling for armed police and MI5 to be disbanded. He claimed that he had not signed the letter, which was produced by the Socialist Campaign for a Labour Victory (SCLV), but he was photographed holding a copy of the letter, although he later said that he did not know that the demand was on the letter.

===2007 Labour leadership campaign===

On 14 July 2006, McDonnell announced his intention to stand for leadership of the Labour Party when Tony Blair announced the date of his resignation. He called for &quot;a challenge to the present political consensus&quot;, and, &quot;a real Labour government based upon the policies that our supporters expect from us&quot;. McDonnell said he would like to see a return to the Labour Party&#x27;s more traditional areas.

Initially, McDonnell and Michael Meacher were the two candidates representing the left wing of the party. McDonnell&#x27;s campaign concentrated on grassroots efforts, which earned him an endorsement from the Trades Union Congress. In a YouGov opinion poll of more than 1,100 Labour Party members asking their preferred choice in the leadership contest, McDonnell received 9% support, and was ranked second to Chancellor Gordon Brown, who led with 80% of the vote. Declared supporters included Diane Abbott, Tony Benn, and Ann Cryer. In total, eleven Labour MPs declared their support on McDonnell&#x27;s campaign website.

Labour Party rules require candidates to be nominated by 12.5% of Labour MPs (45 out of a total of 355 in 2007). Gordon Brown received 313 (88.2%) nominations, while McDonnell failed to collect the 45 nominations required to proceed to the Electoral College. As the only nominated candidate, Gordon Brown was declared leader by the NEC.

===2010 Labour leadership campaign===

On 18 May 2010, news broke that McDonnell wanted to stand in the Labour Party leadership election, to be held following the resignation of Gordon Brown, and would announce it the following day at the Public and Commercial Services Union conference in Brighton. McDonnell noted that it would be &quot;difficult&quot; to get the 33 nominations needed from the Parliamentary Labour Party required to stand in the election.

During a hustings for the GMB Union on 7 June, McDonnell was asked what single act he would do to improve the world if he could travel back to the 1980s. His off-the-cuff reply was that &quot;I was on the GLC that Mrs. Thatcher abolished, I worked for the NUM and we had the NUM strike, I think I would assassinate Thatcher.&quot; Conservative MP Conor Burns told the BBC that &quot;[it was] very distasteful&quot; and &quot;a very silly remark&quot;. McDonnell told the BBC: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry if I have caused offence to anyone. It was a joke and in that audience it was taken as a joke ... it was taken out of context, I can see if people are upset about that and if I have caused offence to anyone of course I apologise.&quot;

By 9 June 2010, the deadline for nominations, he had secured only 16 nominations and withdrew from the contest.

==Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer (2015–2020)==

McDonnell was one of the thirty-six Labour MPs to nominate Jeremy Corbyn (who was elected as Labour leader with 59.5% of the vote) as a candidate in the Labour leadership election of 2015. McDonnell managed Corbyn&#x27;s leadership campaign, and he was appointed Shadow Chancellor in September 2015.

In an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in the previous month, he set out the economic principles that a Corbyn government would follow:

McDonnell&#x27;s first speech as Shadow Chancellor was at the 2015 Labour Party conference in Brighton. In the speech, he set out Labour&#x27;s thinking and priorities in key areas, as well as encouraging Labour MPs who had refused to serve under Corbyn to return.

He surprised many by calling upon Labour MPs to back Conservative Chancellor George Osborne&#x27;s Fiscal Charter, arguing that supporting the proposed deficit reduction framework showed Labour&#x27;s commitment to &quot;living within their means.&quot; However, he reversed that call in October, citing his trip to visit former steelworkers at a recently closed plant in Redcar as the reason for not wanting to be associated with supporting government cuts. McDonnell repeated the word &quot;embarrassing&quot; five times in his Commons response to the U-turn, adding that &quot;a bit of humility amongst politicians never goes amiss&quot;.

In a November speech ahead of Osborne&#x27;s Spending Review, McDonnell pledged that a Labour government would spend 3.5% of GDP on infrastructure and fund research through an Innovation Policy Council, describing his vision for the economy as &quot;socialism with an iPad&quot;.

McDonnell has explored ideas surrounding &quot;alternative models of ownership&quot;, publishing a report on the subject in June 2017 and hosting a discussion conference in London in February 2018. The report sets out the &quot;practicality and necessity of a shift to a variety of alternative forms of ownership and control of productive enterprises, including co-operatives, municipal and locally-led ownership forms, and ... new democratic forms of national ownership&quot;.

During his response to the 2015 Autumn Statement in which he accused George Osborne of &quot;sheer economic illiteracy&quot;, McDonnell highlighted that the government was &quot;selling off at least £5 billion worth of our own assets&quot; to foreign investors, emphasising China. To make this point he quoted from a copy of Chairman Mao Zedong&#x27;s &quot;Little Red Book&quot; and then threw it across the despatch box towards the Conservative front bench. A clearly amused Osborne responded by quipping that it was McDonnell&#x27;s own signed copy.

On 29 September 2016, he was appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom and may therefore use the title &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;.
In the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire, McDonnell said those who died in it were &quot;murdered&quot; by political decisions, arguing &quot;The decision to close fire stations and to cut 10,000 fire fighters and then to freeze their pay for over a decade contributed to those deaths inevitably&quot;. The use of the word &quot;murder&quot; was questioned by some of his colleagues as well as the Conservative Party, with Jim Fitzpatrick, leader of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Fire Safety suggesting it was &quot;premature&quot; to draw conclusions about what caused the deaths.

McDonnell said that Grenfell &quot;symbolised for many everything that&#x27;s gone wrong in this country since austerity was imposed upon us&quot; and used it to highlight pay cuts across the public sector, arguing that Conservatives praise the emergency services &quot;every time there&#x27;s a tragedy&quot; while cutting jobs and wages.

McDonnell sparked controversy when he joked that Conservative politician Esther McVey should be lynched and described her as a &quot;stain on humanity.&quot; He said that he was quoting a constituent speaking at a public meeting convened to oppose McVey&#x27;s policies on benefits and did not endorse the sentiment. The Leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, called the remark &quot;truly evil.&quot;

In 2017, McDonnell said: &quot;I will be the first socialist Labour Chancellor&quot;. McDonnell in his &quot;Who’s Who&quot; entry posted one of his hobbies as &quot;fermenting [sic] the overthrow of capitalism&quot;. In 2018, McDonnell said that he &quot;wants to &quot;overthrow capitalism&quot; and replace it with a &quot;socialist society&quot;&quot;. He also said Venezuela&#x27;s economic problems were because it was no longer a socialist country.

In September 2018, McDonnell said he would only back a second referendum on the European Union if the option to remain is not present. He also agreed with shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner, when he suggested a second referendum could lead to social unrest.

In February 2019, McDonnell sparked controversy when he referred to the former Prime Minister Winston Churchill as a &quot;villain.&quot; Writing on Twitter, Boris Johnson said: &quot;JM should be utterly ashamed of his remarks and withdraw them forthwith.&quot;

During a comprehensive interview conducted by former Labour Party member Alastair Campbell for British &quot;GQ&quot; in October 2019, McDonnell stated his disapproval of the former&#x27;s expulsion from the party and indicated he would support his return. He also expressed his own view that the next party leader should be female, and that the party should employ positive discrimination to aid that prospect if Jeremy Corbyn were to lose the next general election. When asked to name any current Tory politician whom he respected, he declined, subsequently stating that he &quot;can&#x27;t forgive any of them&quot;. Campbell followed up by asking the same question about any historic Tories, to which McDonnell replied &quot;No&quot;.

Upon the election of Keir Starmer as Leader of the Labour Party, McDonnell stood down as Shadow Chancellor and was succeeded by Anneliese Dodds.

== Return to the backbenches (2020–present) ==
In February 2020, McDonnell met with Julian Assange at HM Prison Belmarsh.

He ran a campaign to pass a motion supporting proportional representation at the 2022 Labour Party conference after it failed in 2021 due to a lack of trade union support.

On 24 February 2022, following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, McDonnell was one of 11 Labour MPs threatened with losing the party whip after they signed a statement by the Stop the War Coalition which questioned the legitimacy of NATO and accused the military alliance of &quot;eastward expansion&quot;. All 11 MPs subsequently removed their signatures. McDonnell subsequently joined calls led by the Ukraine Solidarity Campaign for increased arms supplies to Ukraine and criticized those on the left who opposed it.

In 2023, he criticised Keir Starmer for allowing members from the party&#x27;s right wing to become &quot;drunk with power&quot;. This came after members of the Labour left had been barred from running as Labour candidates at the next general election and some left wing sitting MPs such as Ian Byrne were forced to face re-selection by their local constituency parties. It also followed the October 2021 suspension of Jeremy Corbyn from the Labour whip.

In July 2024, McDonnell campaigned on and voted for the scrapping of the two child benefit cap which he opposed in 2015 when it was introduced under the Conservatives, defying the Labour whip. He was one of seven Labour MP&#x27;s who voted in favour of a SNP motion to scrap the rule and as a result had the whip suspended for six months.

==Political views==
McDonnell belongs to the left-wing of the British Labour Party and is a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, a left-wing parliamentary caucus. 

McDonnell opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq and subsequent Iraq war.

When asked if he was a Marxist in an LBC interview with Iain Dale, McDonnell replied: 

==Personal life==
McDonnell has two daughters from his first marriage, which ended in 1985, and a son from his second marriage to Cynthia Pinto in 1995.

In 2013, McDonnell suffered a heart attack and was forced to take time off work.

While raised as a Roman Catholic and attending a minor seminary, McDonnell now identifies as an atheist. Despite this McDonnell still respects the Church and acknowledges that he owes a &quot;debt&quot; to it for shaping his politics, later saying &quot;The values of Catholicism are the inherent values of the Labour Party and the inherent values of socialism&quot;.

===Interview under police caution===

On 19 January 2025, McDonnell, alongside Jeremy Corbyn, agreed to be interviewed under caution by police following a pro-Palestinian rally in central London. The Metropolitan Police said they witnessed a &quot;deliberate effort, including by protest organisers&quot; to breach conditions that had been imposed on the event. However, it is unclear as to the specific reasons as to why McDonnell was invited to an interview.

<text>Horseshoe Falls (Welsh: &quot;Rhaeadr y Bedol&quot;) () is a weir on the River Dee near Llantysilio Hall in Denbighshire, Wales, about north-west of the town of Llangollen.

==History==
The distinctively shaped weir, which is long, helps create a pool of water that can enter the Llangollen Canal (via an adjacent valve house and flow meter). The canal west of Pontcysyllte Aqueduct and the construction of the weir were authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained in 1804 by the Ellesmere Canal Company. The canal was a navigable feeder, which supplied water to the Ellesmere Canal beyond Pontcysyllte, and to the Chester Canal, to which it connected near Nantwich. Thomas Telford was the civil engineer responsible for the design, and the canal and feeder were completed in 1808.

The weir was an important factor in the retention of the canal to Llangollen when the owners of the entire Shropshire Union system, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, decided to close much of the network in 1944. They retained the line of the former Chester Canal and the Ellesmere Canal from Nantwich to Ellesmere Port, the branch of the Chester Canal to Middlewich and the former Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal main line from Nantwich to Wolverhampton. Because Horseshoe Falls was a major source of water to that system, the canal from Llangollen to Nantwich, including the great aqueducts at Pontcysyllte and Chirk, was retained purely as a water supply channel. This action enabled the canal to survive until it was taken over by British Waterways following nationalisation in 1948. With the steady decline in commercial traffic, British Waterways negotiated with the Mid and South East Cheshire Water Board, and the canal is used to transfer water from the Dee at Llantysilio to a reservoir near Hurleston Junction, to the north of Nantwich. In 2009, some per day was conveyed along the canal. Under British Waterways, the canal has become one of the most popular cruising canals in the country. The final from Llangollen to the Falls is not navigable by motorised boats, as it is not wide enough for vessels to turn round, but the towpath extends along the bank right up to the Falls.

Since 2009, the weir has been part of a World Heritage Site, which covers of the Llangollen Canal from just west of Horseshoe Falls to just beyond Chirk Aqueduct. The canal was awarded World Heritage status because of the bold civil engineering solutions needed to construct a canal with no locks through such difficult terrain.

<doc id="415137" wikidata="Q7965804" url="?curid=415137" title="Walter Payton Award">
<text>The Walter Payton Award is awarded annually to the most outstanding offensive player in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division I-AA) of college football as chosen by a nationwide panel of media and college sports information directors. The honor was first given in 1987 to the outstanding player in the division, but in 1995, eligibility was restricted to offensive players, as the Buck Buchanan Award for defensive players was inaugurated.

The award was named in honor of National Football League (NFL) legend Walter Payton, who starred at Jackson State University in the early 1970s.

Up until presentations for the 2014 season, the Payton and Buchanan Awards were awarded by The Sports Network. Since STATS LLC, now known as Stats Perform, acquired The Sports Network in February 2015, it has presented all of the major FCS awards.

The most recent winner of the award is Tommy Mellott, a quarterback from Montana State who earned the honor during the 2024 season.


==Winners==
== Awards won by school ==
This is a list of the colleges and universities who have had a player win a Walter Payton Award. Among the many schools in the division, only nine have claimed more than one award, and only seven have had more than one player win the award. Eastern Washington has had four players win the award, Villanova has had three players win the award, and five have had two players win: Colgate, Georgia Southern, Idaho, New Hampshire, and Eastern Illinois. Two players have won the award twice, with both being the only players from their institutions to win. In 2009, Armanti Edwards from Appalachian State became the first to receive the award twice, followed in 2017 by Jeremiah Briscoe from Sam Houston State. In 2019, Trey Lance of North Dakota State was the first freshman to receive the award.
:^ Team is now a member of the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS).

<text>Robert Graham Marshall-Andrews KC (born 10 April 1944) is a British barrister, author, and retired politician, who was the Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Medway from 1997 to 2010. He defected from his former party at the 2017 general election and endorsed the Liberal Democrats.

==Early life and career==
Marshall-Andrews attended Mill Hill School before attending Bristol University where he read Law and was a resident of Wills Hall. He has prosecuted and defended most forms of serious crime and serious criminals, and specialises in commercial fraud. He is described in &quot;Chambers Legal Directory&quot; as &quot;superb at commanding the attention of the jury&quot; and &quot;well prepared [...] proves brilliant in presentation&quot;. He is a member of the Criminal Bar Association and has been called to the Hong Kong Bar where he has been retained to prosecute serious cases. He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Bristol in 2015.

Marshall-Andrews joined the Labour Party in 1971 and contested the constituency of Richmond, Surrey in October 1974. He was asked to stand for the Medway Constituency in 1992 which he lost to the incumbent Conservative, Dame Peggy Fenner. He is a member of the Association of Labour Lawyers, Greenpeace and the Woodland Trust.

==Parliamentary career==
===First terms (1997–2005)===
Marshall-Andrews entered Parliament in the 1997 general election. He was perceived as being on the libertarian-left wing of the Labour Party, and was a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, but unlike other members of this group was not a trade-unionist by background. He was successfully re-elected in 2001, and tackled the immigration issue directly. &quot;The difference between you and me is that you are a racist and I am not&quot;, he told a voter. &quot;And under no circumstances are you allowed to vote for me. You will not vote for me!&quot;

After a period of bedding down as a new MP, where he aided in the drafting of the banning of handguns, he became an irritant to the government front bench. He rebelled against the government on multiple occasions (20 of those rebellions being in the 2005 parliament), mainly on issues relating to civil liberty. In particular, he successfully opposed proposals to restrict the right to jury trial and to introduce 90 days executive detention without trial. He was in the vanguard of opposition to the Iraq War.
===Later term (2005–10)===
During the night of the 2005 general election, Marshall-Andrews appeared on national television to comment on his predicted defeat before it had been officially declared, remarking that it would be the only good news Tony Blair would get that night, while launching a scathing attack on the Prime Minister. However, he managed to hold on to the seat, with a narrow majority of 213 votes.

His penchant for rebellion, combined with his friendliness towards many Conservative MPs, led him to become unpopular within parts of his own party. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, senior Labour MPs demanded that the whip be withdrawn from him as an example to the 49 Labour MPs who rebelled against the government&#x27;s plans to detain terror suspects for 90 days.

During a break in the Terror Bill debate on 9 November 2005, Marshall-Andrews was seen talking to Conservative MPs Andrew Mitchell, Greg Knight and Damian Green in the Commons lobby. Labour MP Barry Sheerman remonstrated with him. Fellow Labour MP Jim Dowd intervened and at one stage grabbed Marshall-Andrews by the lapels. Dowd and several observers believed they heard him saying of Dowd, &quot;Here&#x27;s another faggot&quot;. The near-scuffle was broken up by government whip Tom Watson, but was widely reported. Marshall-Andrews subsequently insisted that he had actually shouted &quot;faccio&quot;, an Italian word meaning a menial assistant, from which the public school slang &#x27;fag&#x27; is thought to derive. On 31 October 2006, Marshall-Andrews was one of 12 Labour MPs to back Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party&#x27;s call for an inquiry into the Iraq War. Despite his leftist position, however, he nominated Gordon Brown (rather than John McDonnell) for the Labour Party leadership in 2007 and Peter Hain as deputy leader at the same time.

On 15 June 2008, with former Labour cabinet minister Tony Benn, Marshall-Andrews again rebelled in his support for Conservative MP David Davis&#x27; campaign to step down as an MP and force a by-election in his constituency over the bill for a maximum 42-day detention without charge for arrested suspects. Such an action would normally be against party rules, although he believed his withdrawal from the Labour Party whip was improbable because the party was unlikely to put up a candidate against Davis in the by-election. He felt through his action that &quot;the voice of a substantial part of the Labour party may be heard&quot;, over a measure which gained strong resistance among Labour MPs and supporters.

In December 2008, Marshall-Andrews became the first Labour MP to publicly call for the resignation of Speaker Michael Martin over the arrest of Damian Green.

On 17 July 2007, he declared that he would stand down as a Labour MP at the next election, and he left the House of Commons at the 2010 general election.

===Expenses===
In 2009, it became known Marshall-Andrews had claimed £118,000 for expenses at his second home.

==Other activities and later life==

Marshall-Andrews has written several novels, including &quot;The Palace of Wisdom&quot; (published by Hamish Hamilton and Penguin in 1989, also published in the US, France and a best-seller in Germany) and &quot;A Man Without Guilt&quot; (published by Methuen in 2002). More recently, &quot;Camille And The Lost Diaries of Samuel Pepys&quot; was published by Whitefox in 2016. His political memoir &quot;Off Message&quot; was published by Profile in 2011. He has written articles in the national newspapers (&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;) and periodicals (&quot;New Statesman&quot;, parliament&#x27;s &quot;The House&quot; magazine, and &quot;Tribune&quot;).

He is an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society and a Distinguished Supporter of Humanists UK. Trustee and Chair of Development Committee, Geffrye Museum, London. Chair of Governors, Grey Court School 1987–1994. With his wife, he owns &quot;Malator&quot;, an innovative grass-roofed house, known locally as the &quot;Teletubby house&quot;, in Druidston, Pembrokeshire. He is also Founder and Trustee of the George Adamson Wildlife Trust, currently operating in Mkomazi National Park, Tanzania.

On 20 April 2017, the day after parliament voted for an early general election, Marshall-Andrews defected to the Liberal Democrats, calling his former party a &quot;basket-case&quot; and citing its position on Brexit and the failure of his former party to stand down in the 2016 Richmond Park by-election in favour of the Liberal Democrats as reasons for his defection.

<doc id="415141" wikidata="Q4725980" url="?curid=415141" title="Alice Mahon">
<text>Alice Mahon (; 28 September 1937 – 25 December 2022) was a British trade unionist and Labour politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Halifax from 1987 until 2005.

Mahon was a left-winger who was a member of the Socialist Campaign Group and was a Eurosceptic, and a frequent rebel against Labour&#x27;s Blair government. She left the House of Commons in 2005 and resigned from the Labour Party in 2009, expressing objections to the party&#x27;s political positions and internal operations. However, she rejoined the party in 2015 in support of Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s election as leader.

==Early life and career==
Born Alice Bottomley in Buttershaw, Bradford, she attended grammar school in Halifax and worked in the National Health Service as a nursing auxiliary for ten years. In 1979, she gained a BA in Social Policy from the University of Bradford and taught Trade Union Studies at Bradford College from 1979 to 1987. Meanwhile, she was a councillor on Calderdale Council.

==Parliamentary career==
Mahon was first elected for the Halifax constituency at the 1987 general election. In 1994, commenting on Tony Blair, Mahon told Chris Mullin that she was &quot;in the Stop Blair camp&quot; of the party.

Mahon opposed the missile defence plans during her period in the House of Commons and sought to protect benefits for parents, women&#x27;s rights (particularly regarding abortion), and gay rights. Mahon was also a supporter of reform of the House of Lords. She was opposed to the Iraq War, speaking in 2004 of the &quot;cruel barbarism that has been inflicted upon Iraq&quot;. She told the 2003 Labour Party Conference, &quot;we were lied to about WMD and there is no delicate way of putting it&quot;.

In a July 2003 Commons debate, she queried the support of John Reid, then the Secretary of State for Health for Foundation Hospitals: &quot;How can the Secretary of State stand there as a Scottish MP who is not going to have one of these divisive hospitals, and yet is voting to inflict them on the people of Halifax?&quot; In a version of Tam Dalyell&#x27;s West Lothian question, the government in the subsequent parliamentary division would have lost the vote without the support of Scottish and Welsh Labour MPs. Labour&#x27;s majority of 164 was reduced to 17 because of votes against the motion and abstentions. &quot;As English MPs, we have to settle this question of Scots and Welsh MPs voting for things they&#x27;re not going to have&quot;, Mahon said at the time.

==Later life==
===Fallujah===
In November 2005, a film documentary by Sigfrido Ranucci of Italy&#x27;s Rai News 24, &quot;The Hidden Massacre&quot;, asserted that the US military had used white phosphorus (WP) as an incendiary weapon, including against civilians in the Second Battle of Fallujah. The RAI documentary also quoted a 13 June 2005 UK MOD letter to Mahon, stating that:
The US destroyed its remaining stock of Vietnam era napalm in 2001 but, according to the reports for 1 Marine Expeditionary Force (1 MEF) serving in Iraq in 2003, they used a total of 30 MK 77 weapons in Iraq between 31 March and 2 April 2003, against military targets away from civilian areas. The MK 77 firebomb does not have the same composition as napalm, although it has similar destructive characteristics. The Pentagon has also told us that owing to the limited accuracy of the MK 77, it is not generally used in urban terrain or in areas where civilians are congregated.

===Slobodan Milošević===
Mahon was a defence witness in the trial of Slobodan Milošević in 2006. Following the testimony of Slobodan Jarčević, foreign minister of the self-declared Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) in modern-day Croatia, from October 1992 until becoming foreign policy advisor to the RSK president Milan Martić in April 1994, Milošević called Mahon, who was an MP throughout the 1990s and sat on the NATO parliamentary committee from 1992.

In 1999, she said:
===Račak===
Mahon appeared to be critical of the generally accepted narrative of the Račak massacre.

She spoke at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on 1 March 2006 and stated under examination: &quot;Yes, I think there is something highly suspicious about what happened at Racak.&quot; Judge Robinson responded, &quot;But to say that Mr. Walker arranged it, that&#x27;s a very serious --&quot; which Mahon interjected to say, &quot;Well, would you like me to say that I think Mr. Walker just happened to be there, and people disagreed with him profoundly about that being a massacre.&quot;

===Macular degeneration===
Mahon suffered from age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a disease which causes progressive blindness. Mahon lost most of the sight in one eye and expected to lose sight in the other. Calderdale Primary Care Trust refused to fund a drug which could stabilise or improve her condition, in 2007 she threatened to take the PCT to the High Court.

===Resignation from the Labour Party===
Mahon resigned her membership of the Labour Party in April 2009, saying she could no longer condone how it operates. She told BBC News that she had considered resigning in 2005, having &quot;totally disapproved of everything Tony Blair was doing&quot;, but had been more optimistic of his eventual successor, Gordon Brown: &quot;I hoped we might go back to being a caring and progressive party. In the event I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong&quot;. She had backed John McDonnell&#x27;s aborted Labour leadership campaign.

In her letter to the Halifax Constituency Labour Party, she wrote: &quot;This Labour Government should hang its head in shame for inflicting [the Welfare Reform Bill] on the British public just as we face the most severe recession any of us have experienced in a lifetime.&quot; The Bill was criticised by a number of disability campaign groups and Labour MPs for not helping the disabled or unemployed. Mahon said she was dismayed at the impotence shown by the government in tackling energy providers and financial institutions. She also condemned the failure of the party to stick to its election manifesto, including pledges not to privatise the Royal Mail and to give the country a referendum on the EU Constitution (which later became the Lisbon Treaty). The smear tactics attempted by Brown&#x27;s by then former official Damian McBride and lobbyist Derek Draper, which became known around this time, were also a factor in her decision to leave the Labour Party. She told &quot;The Yorkshire Post&quot;:

My stepdaughter Rachel said to me: &#x27;How could they do that to people like David Cameron and his wife Samantha when they had recently lost their son Ivan? What kind of people think it would be a good idea to smear them?&#x27; I was sickened by that – that is not the Labour Party that I joined all those years ago. [...] Quite simply I have had it with New Labour.

Mahon remained active in left-wing politics, including the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and the Stop the War Coalition, of which she was a patron. She was a Distinguished Supporter of Humanists UK, and an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society. The No2EU campaign said she had decided to support them in the June 2009 European Parliament election.

Mahon was interviewed in 2012 as part of The History of Parliament&#x27;s oral history project.

She re-joined Labour in 2015 following the election of Jeremy Corbyn as party leader.

==Personal life==
Mahon was married to John Gledhill until the couple divorced in 1972. She then married Tony Mahon, and they remained together until his death in January 2022. She had two sons from her first marriage and a stepdaughter from her second. She was a longtime resident of Northowram, West Yorkshire.

Mahon died at a care home in Halifax on 25 December 2022, at the age of 85. A remembrance service was held at Halifax Minster on 6 March 2023, and former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was in attendance.

<text>June Tripp (born June Howard-Tripp; 11 June 1901 – 14 January 1985), sometimes known just by her screen name, June, was a British-American actress.

==Biography==

Born June Howard-Tripp in Blackpool, she worked mainly on stage (in revue). She made a handful of films, mostly in the silent era. Her most notable screen role was in the silent Alfred Hitchcock thriller &quot;The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog&quot; (1927), opposite Ivor Novello.

In March 1929, June Tripp married John Alan Burns, 4th Baron Inverclyde and went to live at Castle Wemyss. She appears as &quot;Topsy&quot; in Inverclyde&#x27;s account of his travels in his steam yacht &quot;Beryl&quot; around the Mediterranean in the summer of 1929. However, by September 1930, Tripp was in Hollywood having taken up what would prove to be longterm American residency. 

In November 1930, Tripp sued for annulment of her marriage, alleging she and Inverclyde had &quot;never lived together as man and wife&quot;. Tripp ultimately received a divorce in Reno in August 1931 (but was still considered married in her native land until Inverclyde was granted a divorce in December 1933). Tripp returned to the British stage in the summer of 1932 performing in the musical &quot;Fanfare&quot;.

In August 1937 Tripp married Edward Hillman Jr, a Chicago department store heir who she had met in California some years prior: the couple wed in Cannes after chancing to meet again in Paris. Although interlocutory divorces for the couple were granted in December 1939 and March 1947 they both times reunited to remain married until Hillman&#x27;s death at age 65 in 1966, the Hillmans long having split their time between residences in Beverly Hills and Santa Barbara. Tripp had become an American citizen in 1951.

Likely the least known expat &quot;film star&quot; to appear &quot;pro bono&quot; in the Hollywood paean to British resilience &quot;Forever and a Day&quot; (released in 1943 - most of the film including Tripp&#x27;s scenes date from 1941), Tripp made occasional appearances in community theatre productions and had uncredited bit parts in the films &quot;A Song for Miss Julie&quot; (1945) and &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1952) (as the Mother Superior): she also narrated the Jean Renoir film &quot;The River&quot; (1951).

Tripp published a memoir entitled &quot;The Glass Ladder&quot; in 1960, in which she recounts with some vividness her &quot;Rebecca&quot;-esque life at Castle Wemyss with Inverclyde and his rather forbidding housekeeper, whom she compares to Judith Anderson&#x27;s portrayal in the Hitchcock film, though both novel and film were released some years after her divorce.

She died in New York City in 1985.

<text>Kelvin Peter Hopkins (born 22 August 1941) is a British politician. He was first elected as the Labour Member of Parliament for Luton North in 1997. Hopkins was suspended by the Labour Party in 2017 after allegations of sexual misconduct were made against him in the 2017 Westminster sexual misconduct allegations. Hopkins did not stand for re-election in the 2019 general election.

Hopkins is a supporter of pro-Brexit group Leave Means Leave.

==Background==
Kelvin Hopkins was born in Leicester, son of physicist Harold Hopkins FRS. He was educated at Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School for Boys, Barnet, north London; he then attended the University of Nottingham where he was awarded a BA degree in Politics, Economics and Mathematics with Statistics. Between 1958 and 1963, he was a &quot;semi-professional&quot; jazz musician, playing tenor saxophone and clarinet.

With the exception of two years as a lecturer at St Albans College of Further Education (now called Oaklands College) from 1971 to 1973, he has worked entirely within the trade union movement. He joined the Trades Union Congress as an economist in 1969, and rejoined it in 1973 following his stint as a lecturer. He was appointed a policy and research officer in NALGO in 1977, leaving its successor UNISON in 1994.

Hopkins was a councillor on Luton Borough Council from 1972 to 1976.

==Parliamentary career==
Hopkins was the Labour candidate for Luton North at the 1983 general election; he finished in second place, 11,981 votes behind the sitting Conservative MP John Carlisle. Hopkins contested the seat again fourteen years later, at the 1997 general election, successfully gaining it from the Conservatives, with a majority of 9,626 votes and 54.6% of the votes cast. He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 28 November 1997.

In the House of Commons, he was a member of the Broadcasting Select committee from 1999 to 2001, and has served on the Public Administration Select Committee since 2002. He also served as an adviser to Richard Caborn on yachting when Caborn was Minister of Sport. Hopkins is a member of many all-party groups. He served as the chairman of the group on further education and lifelong learning, and as the vice-chairman of the groups on jazz appreciation; historic vehicles; Norway; constitution and citizenship; transport infrastructure and trans-European networks. He also served as the treasurer of the group on building societies and financial mutuals. Hopkins was on the left wing of the Labour Party, being a member of the Socialist Campaign Group and is a Eurosceptic. He was known for his rebellious stance amongst Labour MPs, and has been described as a &quot;rebellion prone left-wing economist&quot; by Andrew Roth in &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

In the fiscal year of 2007–08, Hopkins&#x27; total expenses claims amounted to £121,809, of which his second home allowance was £1,242. He also emerged well from the 2009 MPs expenses scandal, being deemed a &quot;saint&quot; by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; for his minimal second home claims.

In June 2010, he was selected as a Labour member of the Transport Select Committee.

Before the 2016 referendum on British membership of the EU, Hopkins signed the People&#x27;s Pledge, a cross-party campaign for such a referendum, and became a member of its Advisory Council. He was one of sixteen signatories of an open letter to the-then Labour leader Ed Miliband in January 2015, which called on the party to commit to oppose further austerity, take rail franchises back into public ownership and strengthen collective bargaining arrangements.

He is a supporter of homeopathy, having signed an Early Day Motion in support of its continued funding by the National Health Service.

Hopkins was one of 36 Labour MPs to nominate Jeremy Corbyn as a candidate in the Labour leadership election of 2015. In 2016, he was one of the chief Labour figures to support the &quot;Leave&quot; campaign in the UK Referendum on EU membership. After turning down the offer of a frontbench position when Jeremy Corbyn became leader, Hopkins was &quot;called up&quot; to serve in the Shadow Cabinet following a spate of resignations at the end of June 2016. He was able to return to the backbenches following Corbyn&#x27;s re-election as party leader and the formation of a new Shadow Cabinet in October.

Hopkins did not stand for re-election in the 2019 general election.

===Sexual harassment allegations===

Hopkins was suspended by the Labour Party on 2 November 2017 following allegations made against him which are currently being investigated. According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Hopkins had allegedly sexually harassed and behaved inappropriately towards a Labour Party activist, Ava Etemadzadeh, now aged 27. The claims were originally brought to the attention of Rosie Winterton in 2015 when she was Labour&#x27;s Chief Whip. Hopkins has &quot;absolutely and categorically&quot; rejected the accusation of sexual impropriety.

Just over a week later on 10 November, the Labour MP Kerry McCarthy said that Hopkins had been paying her unwanted attention, via written notes, since 1994 when both were chairs of adjacent Constituency Labour Parties in Luton. Allegedly the attention resumed when McCarthy became an MP in 2005 and continued until early 2016. The notes were shown to the Labour whips and have been reproduced in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. While Hopkins had not been physically abusive towards McCarthy, she told the newspaper&#x27;s political editor Heather Stewart that &quot;I was really, really wary of him&quot;.

Four months later, Etemadzadeh said she was &quot;totally disillusioned&quot; with Labour as she still did not know when her case would be heard.

In January 2021, Hopkins resigned from the Labour Party.

==Personal life==
Hopkins married Patricia Mabel Langley on 21 August 1965 in Barnet. The couple have a son and a daughter, Rachel, who went on to become MP for Luton South. Hopkins is a French speaker, a keen photographer, saxophonist and enjoys sailing on the Norfolk Broads. He is an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society. Since 1993, Hopkins has been a governor of Luton Sixth Form College. He has lived in Luton since November 1969.

<text>The West Central Railway (abbreviated WCR), one of the 19 zones of the Indian Railways, came into existence on 1 April 2003. It is headquartered at Jabalpur. It was created by taking away two divisions namely Bhopal division and Jabalpur division from central railways and one division namely Kota division from Western Railway zone. The WCR zone provides rail route coverage to the west central region of India. Most of its route is in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan with a very little portion in the state of Uttar Pradesh.

==History==
On 1 April 2003, the West Central Railway was reconstituted from parts of Central Railway and Western Railway by allocating Jabalpur and Bhopal divisions of the Central Railway zone (CR) and the reorganized of the Western Railway zone (WR) to WCR.

==Jurisdiction==

The zone serves eastern &amp; central Madhya Pradesh, southern Uttar Pradesh, and northeastern Rajasthan state. It contains the Tuglakabad (TKD) locomotive shed, which belongs to Kota Division of WCR but is situated in the Northern Railways territory. WCR meets Northern Railway at Mathura, Western Railway at Nagda, North Western Railway at Chittorgarh, Central Railway at Khandwa and Itarsi, North Central Railway at Bina and Manikpur, South East Central Railway at Katni and East Central Railway at Singaroli stations.

==Divisions==

There are 3 divisions in West Central Railway zone;

* Jabalpur railway division
* Bhopal railway division
* Kota railway division

==Loco sheds==
There are five loco sheds in WCR.
* Electric Loco Shed, Tughlakabad
* Electric Loco Shed, Itarsi 
* Diesel Loco Shed, Katni
* Electric Loco Shed, New Katni Jn. 
* Diesel Loco Shed, Itarsi

<doc id="415149" wikidata="Q6988615" url="?curid=415149" title="Neil Gerrard">
<text>Neil Francis Gerrard (born 3 July 1942) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Walthamstow from 1992 until 2010.

==Early life==
Gerrard was born in Farnworth, England, and educated at Manchester Grammar School and Wadham College, Oxford where he was awarded a BA degree in natural science in 1964. He later studied at the Chelsea College of Science and Technology where he received a MEd in Education in 1973. He received a Diploma in Professional Studies in Education (DPSE) from the Polytechnic of the South Bank in 1983.

From 1965 he taught at the Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School for Boys, Barnet, leaving in 1968 to take up the position of lecturer in chemistry and later in computing at Hackney College, where he remained until his election to parliament 24 years later.

He was elected as a councillor in the London Borough of Waltham Forest in 1973; he was the leader of the Labour group from 1983, and the leader of the Council from 1986 until he left the council in 1990.

==Parliamentary career==
He was selected to contest the Chingford constituency at the 1979 general election but was defeated by the sitting Conservative MP Norman Tebbit by 12,383 votes. He was elected to the House of Commons at the 1992 general election for Walthamstow, when he unseated the one-term Tory Hugo Summerson by 3,022 votes. He received 45.7% of the vote, compared to his Conservative opponent who received 37.2% of the vote.

He made his maiden speech on 12 May 1992.

In Parliament he served on the environment select committee from 1995 until he was made a Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Financial Secretary to the Treasury Dawn Primarolo following the 1997 General Election. He resigned as Primarolo&#x27;s PPS just a few months later in 1997 over lone-parent benefits cuts introduced by the Secretary of State for Social Security Harriet Harman. He served on several select committees and was a member of the administration committee since the 2005 general election. He was the chairman of the all-party groups on AIDS and on refugees.

He is a left-winger within the Labour Party, and was a member of the Socialist Campaign Group and formerly a member of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament&#x27;s national council. In the 1990s he was a director of the Theatre Royal, Stratford East.

Gerrard announced on 23 February 2007 that he would be standing down as an MP at the next general election.

==Personal life==
Gerrard married Marian Fitzgerald in 1968; the couple had two sons, but they divorced in 1983. He has lived in Walthamstow for the past 50 years, and used to own a racing greyhound with fellow MP Harry Cohen which, although now retired, raced at the Walthamstow Dog Track.

<text>The Davey O&#x27;Brien Award, officially the Davey O&#x27;Brien National Quarterback Award, named after Davey O&#x27;Brien, is presented annually to the collegiate American football player judged by the Davey O&#x27;Brien Foundation to be the best of all National Collegiate Athletic Association quarterbacks. The Davey O&#x27;Brien Hall of Fame is housed at The Fort Worth Club in Fort Worth, Texas. The annual awards dinner and trophy presentation is held there as well, usually in February.

In 1977, directly after the death of O&#x27;Brien, the award was established as the Davey O&#x27;Brien Memorial Trophy, and was given to the most outstanding player in the Southwest. Texas running back Earl Campbell won the trophy in 1977, Oklahoma running back Billy Sims won it in 1978, and Baylor linebacker Mike Singletary won it twice in 1979 and 1980. In 1981, the award was renamed the Davey O&#x27;Brien Award. Since then, only four players have won the award more than once: Ty Detmer of BYU, Danny Wuerffel of Florida, Jason White of Oklahoma, and Deshaun Watson of Clemson.

<doc id="415153" wikidata="Q17442397" url="?curid=415153" title="Major second">
<text>In Western music theory, a major second (sometimes also called whole tone or a whole step) is a second spanning two semitones (). A second is a musical interval encompassing two adjacent staff positions (see Interval number for more details). For example, the interval from C to D is a major second, as the note D lies two semitones above C, and the two notes are notated on adjacent staff positions. Diminished, minor and augmented seconds are notated on adjacent staff positions as well, but consist of a different number of semitones (zero, one, and three).

The major second is the interval that occurs between the first and second degrees of a major scale, the tonic and the supertonic. On a musical keyboard, a major second is the interval between two keys separated by one key, counting white and black keys alike. On a guitar string, it is the interval separated by two frets. In moveable-do solfège, it is the interval between &quot;do&quot; and &quot;re&quot;. It is considered a melodic step, as opposed to larger intervals called skips.

Intervals composed of two semitones, such as the major second and the diminished third, are also called tones, whole tones, or whole steps.
In just intonation, major seconds can occur in at least two different frequency ratios:
9:8 (about 203.9 cents) and 10:9 (about 182.4 cents). The largest (9:8) ones are called major tones or greater tones, the smallest (10:9) are called minor tones or lesser tones. Their size differs by exactly one syntonic comma (81:80, or about 21.5 cents).
Some equal temperaments, such as 15-ET and 22-ET, also distinguish between a greater and a lesser tone.

The major second was historically considered one of the most dissonant intervals of the diatonic scale, although much 20th-century music saw it reimagined as a consonance. It is common in many different musical systems, including Arabic music, Turkish music and music of the Balkans, among others. It occurs in both diatonic and pentatonic scales.

. Here, middle C is followed by D, which is a tone 200 cents sharper than C, and then by both tones together.

==Major and minor tones==
In tuning systems using just intonation, such as 5-limit tuning, in which major seconds occur in two different sizes, the wider of them is called a major tone or greater tone, and the narrower minor tone or, lesser tone. The difference in size between a major tone and a minor tone is equal to one syntonic comma (about 21.51 cents).

The major tone is the 9:8 interval , and it is an approximation thereof in other tuning systems, while the minor tone is the 10:9 ratio . The major tone may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the eighth and ninth harmonics. The minor tone may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the ninth and tenth harmonics. The 10:9 minor tone arises in the C major scale between D &amp; E and G &amp; A, and is &quot;a sharper dissonance&quot; than 9:8. The 9:8 major tone arises in the C major scale between C &amp; D, F &amp; G, and A &amp; B. This 9:8 interval was named epogdoon (meaning &#x27;one eighth in addition&#x27;) by the Pythagoreans.

Notice that in these tuning systems, a third kind of whole tone, even wider than the major tone, exists. This interval of two semitones, with ratio 256:225, is simply called the diminished third (for further details, see ).

Some equal temperaments also produce major seconds of two different sizes, called &quot;greater&quot; and &quot;lesser tones&quot; (or &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor tones&quot;). For instance, this is true for 15-ET, 22-ET, 34-ET, 41-ET, 53-ET, and 72-ET.
Conversely, in twelve-tone equal temperament, Pythagorean tuning, and meantone temperament (including 19-ET and 31-ET) all major seconds have the same size, so there cannot be a distinction between a greater and a lesser tone.

In any system where there is only one size of major second, the terms &quot;greater&quot; and &quot;lesser tone&quot; (or &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor tone&quot;) are rarely used with a different meaning. Namely, they are used to indicate the two distinct kinds of whole tone, more commonly and more appropriately called &quot;major second&quot; (M2) and &quot;diminished third&quot; (d3). Similarly, major semitones and minor semitones are more often and more appropriately referred to as &quot;minor seconds&quot; (m2) and &quot;augmented unisons&quot; (A1), or &quot;diatonic&quot; and &quot;chromatic semitones&quot;.

Unlike almost all uses of the terms &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot;, these intervals span the &quot;same&quot; number of semitones. They both span 2 semitones, while, for example, a major third (4 semitones) and minor third (3 semitones) differ by one semitone. Thus, to avoid ambiguity, it is preferable to call them &quot;greater tone&quot; and &quot;lesser tone&quot; (see also greater and lesser diesis).

Two major tones equal a ditone.

==&quot;Epogdoon&quot;==

In Pythagorean music theory, the epogdoon () is the interval with the ratio 9 to 8. The word is composed of the prefix &quot;epi&quot;- meaning &quot;on top of&quot; and &quot;ogdoon&quot; meaning &quot;one eighth&quot;; so it means &quot;one eighth in addition&quot;. For example, the natural numbers are 8 and 9 in this relation ().

According to Plutarch, the Pythagoreans hated the number 17 because it separates the 16 from its Epogdoon 18.

&quot;[&quot;Epogdoos&quot;] is the 9:8 ratio that corresponds to the tone, [&quot;hêmiolios&quot;] is the 3:2 ratio that is associated with the musical fifth, and [&quot;epitritos&quot;] is the 4:3 ratio associated with the musical fourth. It is common to translate epogdoos as &#x27;tone&#x27; [major second].&quot;

<text>William Etherington (born 17 July 1941) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament for Sunderland North from 1992 to 2010.

==Early life==
Bill Etherington was born in Sunderland, County Durham and was educated at the Redby Infant and Junior Schools on Fulwell Road, Monkwearmouth Grammar School (five years above Hilary Armstrong) and latterly at Durham University. He was an apprentice fitter at the Austin and Pickersgill Shipyard in Sunderland for five years from 1957. He became a fitter for Beal &amp; Co in Sunderland in 1962, before joining the National Coal Board in 1963 and for the following twenty years worked as a fitter at the Dawdon Colliery in County Durham. He has been a member of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) since 1963, and from 1983 until his election was a full-time trade union official with them, as general secretary of its Durham Colliery Mechanics&#x27; Association affiliate. He was a full-time official during the UK miners&#x27; strike (1984-1985). From 1988 to 1992, he was also vice president of the North East Region of the NUM.

==Parliamentary career==
He was first elected in the 1992 General Election for Sunderland North, replacing fellow left-winger, Bob Clay. Etherington held the seat comfortably with a majority of 17,004 votes, and was re-elected with strong majorities subsequently. He made his maiden speech on 11 May 1992.

In the 1992 general election, he polled 60.7% of the vote, with his Conservative opponent winning 26.9% of the vote. In the 1997 election, he took 68.2% against Conservative Andrew Selous, who ranked in second place with just 16.7% of the vote. He also confidently beat his Conservative opponents in the 2001 (62.7% against 17.9%) and 2005 general elections (54.4% against 19.8%).

He is a left-winger, a member of the Socialist Campaign Group and rebelled against Tony Blair&#x27;s government. While debating the reform of the House of Lords in March 2007, Etherington also called for the abolition of the British Monarchy.

==Personal life==
He has been married to Irene Holton since 1963 and they have two daughters. He was characterised in parliament by his three-piece suits and strong &#x27;Mackem&#x27; accent.

In December 2006, Etherington announced he would be standing down at the end of the 2005 - 2010 Parliament as his constituency was to be abolished.

<doc id="415156" wikidata="Q283799" url="?curid=415156" title="XXX (2002 film)">
<text>XXX (stylized as xXx and pronounced Triple X) is a 2002 American action film directed by Rob Cohen, produced by Neal H. Moritz and written by Rich Wilkes. The first installment in the &quot;xXx&quot; film series, the film stars Vin Diesel as Xander Cage, a thrill-seeking extreme sports enthusiast, stuntman, and rebellious athlete-turned-reluctant spy for the National Security Agency. Cage is sent on a dangerous mission to infiltrate a group of potential Russian terrorists in Central Europe. The film also stars Asia Argento, Marton Csokas, and Samuel L. Jackson. Cohen, Moritz, and Diesel had previously worked on &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; (2001) as director, producer and cast member respectively. The film grossed $277.4 million worldwide and was followed by two sequels, &quot;&quot; (2005) and &quot;&quot; (2017).

==Plot==
Russian terrorist group Anarchy 99 acquires the biochemical weapon &quot;Silent Night&quot;, presumed missing since the fall of the Soviet Union. Undercover NSA agent Jim McGrath is assigned to recover the weapon but is killed by Anarchy 99 at a Rammstein concert.

NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons suggests sending Xander &quot;XXX&quot; Cage, an extreme sports professional wanted for unlawful protesting, citing his lack of ties to the US government. Under Gibbons&#x27; supervision, Cage passes two field tests and reluctantly accepts the job, as the other option is prison.

In Prague, Cage meets his team which includes his supervisor, Czech agent Milan Sova. While scouting an Anarchy 99 party, Cage identifies Sova as a police officer, earning him favor with the group and catching the attention of the leader Yorgi. Cage asks Yorgi about purchasing high end sports cars, and Yorgi&#x27;s girlfriend and lieutenant Yelena, gives Cage an account number.

Gibbons calls Cage about changes to the plan but is impressed when he gives them information provided by Kolya, Yorgi&#x27;s star-struck younger brother. Tech-specialist Agent Toby Shavers then provides Cage with gadgets including a revolver with special ammo, binoculars that can see through walls and explosives disguised as bandages.

As Cage attends the car deal he made with Yorgi, Sova attempts to intercede. Using the special ammo, Cage fakes Sova&#x27;s death. Having earned Yorgi&#x27;s trust, Cage joins Anarchy 99. Yorgi brings Cage back to a castle after a dance party at one of his nightclubs that serves as Anarchy 99&#x27;s headquarters. Cage, while searching for the biochemical weapon, catches Yelena investigating Yorgi&#x27;s secret safe. He takes her to a nearby restaurant to discuss the matter and reveals his true identity.

Sova betrays Cage to Yorgi, so he sends his trusted sniper Kirill to kill him. While watching the pair, Kirill, who is in love with Yelena, warns her. As Cage and Yelena stage a fight, the NSA suddenly appears to capture him, and Yelena is taken back to Anarchy 99.

Cage meets with Gibbons, who demands he return to America as his cover is blown and special forces are planning to assault the castle. He refuses, fearing for Yelena&#x27;s life and bitter that Sova blew his cover. Cage sneaks into Yorgi&#x27;s castle and follows him into a secret underground lab. Overhearing his plan to launch &quot;Silent Night&quot; from the water-borne drone Ahab; he first tests the weapon on the scientists who developed it, to Cage and Yelena&#x27;s horror. Cage flees the area after killing Kolya. At his hideout, Sova is waiting for him, now with Yorgi. Yelena saves Cage, revealing herself to be an abandoned undercover Russian Federal Security Service agent. Cage relays Yorgi&#x27;s plans to the NSA in return for Yelena&#x27;s asylum.

Against orders, Shavers heavily arms Cage&#x27;s car, who then parachutes from a plane on a snowboard near Anarchy 99&#x27;s communication tower. The avalanche he starts destroys the tower but he is captured by Yorgi, who already knew Yelena&#x27;s identity. As Yorgi prepares to kill them, the special forces attack. Cage and Yelena free themselves, but Yorgi launches Ahab before Cage kills him. The Czech military prepares to destroy Ahab with airstrikes, though this will release some of the biochemical agent. Cage and Yelena take his heavily modified car, to catch up to Ahab. Cage harpoons and disables the weapon moments before it goes off.

Cage and Yelena are recovered, and Gibbons follows through on his promises. Sometime later, the couple is relaxing in Bora Bora when Gibbons contacts him for another mission, but Cage ignores him.

==Cast==
* Vin Diesel as Xander &quot;XXX&quot; Cage, a thrill-seeking American extreme sports enthusiast, stuntman, and anti-establishment activist. Idolized in some sub-cultures, Cage is also hunted by the authorities and he is offered a deal to become a spy for the National Security Agency in exchange for leniency, the agency requiring an agent who can do the current job without the military professional training that Anarchy 99&#x27;s background will allow them to recognise.
* Samuel L. Jackson as Augustus Gibbons, a high-ranking official in the National Security Agency who has the power to give Cage a pardon for his crimes. He uses this fact as leverage to recruit Cage for a mission because he knows Cage is the only person who could successfully infiltrate Anarchy 99, recognising the benefits of Cage&#x27;s rebellious attitude and unorthodox methods.
* William Hope as Roger Donnan, the associate and administrator of the National Security Agency.
* Danny Trejo as &quot;El Jefe&quot;, a torturer for a Colombian drug cartel.
* Asia Argento as Yelena, Yorgi&#x27;s apparent girlfriend. Originally a Russian intelligence agent, sent to watch over Yorgi but has since been abandoned by her superiors. Yelena becomes romantically involved with Cage and he attempts to get her political asylum in the United States for her assistance in bringing down Yorgi.
* Marton Csokas as Yorgi, a former soldier in the Soviet Army, now a wealthy hedonist owning a string of properties around Eastern Europe, including a castle and nightclubs. Yorgi is also the leader of Anarchy 99, a group of militant anarchists with a disdain for all forms of government and authority, and society in general. His ultimate aim is complete lawlessness across the world.
* Michael Roof as Toby Lee Shavers, an NSA techno-genius and gadget specialist.
* Richy Müller as Milan Sova, a cop and double agent.
* Werner Daehn as Kirill, a member of Anarchy 99, cigarette addict and sharpshooter.
* Petr Jákl as Kolya, Yorgi&#x27;s younger brother.
* Jan Pavel Filipensky as Viktor, a member of Anarchy 99 and close friend of Yorgi. He is usually with Yorgi wherever he goes.
* Tom Everett as Dick Hotchkiss, a conservative California State Senator; his car is stolen and wrecked by Cage prior to his recruitment by the NSA, as a protest against some of Hotchkiss&#x27;s policies.
* Thomas Ian Griffith as Jim McGrath, an undercover agent killed by Anarchy 99 while trying to retrieve the Silent Night weapon.
* Eve as J.J., Xander&#x27;s friend
* Leila Arcieri as Jordan King
* Rammstein as themselves
* Orbital as themselves

To imply Xander Cage&#x27;s credibility within extreme sport subcultures, various personalities make cameo appearances:

* Tony Hawk makes a cameo appearance in the Corvette scene from the bottom of the bridge driving the getaway Cadillac, (near the beginning of the film) and skating over a half-pipe at Xander&#x27;s place later.
* Mike Vallely also makes a cameo as a cameraman and an extra. Pro motocross rider Carey Hart is seen in the back seat of the Cadillac driven by Tony Hawk.
* BMX rider Mat Hoffman exchanges lines with Xander during the party scene.
* Also during the party scene, Josh Todd (the lead singer of Buckcherry) makes a cameo appearance though he never turns around, but his suicide king of hearts tattoo can be seen on his back.

== Production ==

In July 2001 it was announced that Vin Diesel will receive in the neighborhood of $10 million to star in the film, with an initial release date of July 26, 2002. It is believed that before Diesel was cast, Eric Bana turned down the lead role of Xander Cage. In August 2001, Sony put up a large billboard advertising the film in Hollywood, before a script had been written.

Filming took place at three locations. Most of the film is set in Prague, Czech Republic. The Corvette jump was filmed at the Foresthill Bridge in Auburn State Recreation Area, Auburn, California. The final scenes were set in Bora Bora, Tahiti, and other areas in southern West Virginia.

Several Czech Su-22s were used for the film. It was one of the last actions of these aircraft – the Czech Air Force decommissioned Sukhois in 2002.

Vin Diesel did many of his own stunts, director Rob Cohen said: &quot;I think the thing is that Vin did more than he should have, but less than he wanted to.&quot; Diesel took a fall during the avalanche scene, and landed head first and wasn&#x27;t moving, and Cohen was worried the star of the film might have broken his neck. A scene where Cage base jumps from a Corvette was performed by Tim Rigby wearing a Vin Diesel mask. The motorcycle jump was performed by professional motocross rider and stuntman Jeremy Stenberg, and Diesel&#x27;s face was later added digitally.

Stunt player Harry O&#x27;Connor, Diesel&#x27;s stunt double, was killed on April 4, 2002, when he hit a pillar of the Palacký Bridge in Prague while para-sailing during one of the action scenes. The accident occurred while filming the second take of the stunt; O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s first attempt was completed without incident and can be seen in the completed film, which was dedicated to him.

The first few minutes of the film take place at a concert of German Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein in Prague, performing the song &quot;Feuer Frei&quot;. The same clip is available, but from the band&#x27;s perspective (with only brief scenes from the film) in their video compilation &quot;Lichtspielhaus&quot;.

== Music ==

The film score was composed by Randy Edelman, a frequent collaborator of Cohen&#x27;s. The film also featured a contemporary rock music soundtrack. Rammstein provided some of the music and was even featured in the film in the opening scene. During the club scene in Prague, Orbital can be seen playing their exclusive track &quot;Technologicque Park&quot; live before the dancing crowd. The soundtrack album also features Queens of the Stone Age, Drowning Pool, Flaw, Mushroomhead, Hatebreed, Nelly, Lil Wayne, N.E.R.D, Fermín IV and Moby. It was released on August 6, 2002, through Universal Records. It peaked at No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, No. 16 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and No. 1 on the Top Soundtracks. The &quot;Tweaker remix&quot; of the song &quot;Adrenaline&quot; by Gavin Rossdale (the lead singer of Bush) was featured in the film, while the original version is included on the soundtrack. None of Edelman&#x27;s score was included on the album, with a separate disc of his work released by Varèse Sarabande.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
The film opened in 3,374 theaters and grossed $44,506,103 in its opening weekend. It grossed a total of $142 million, and a further $135 million internationally for a worldwide total of $277.4 million worldwide.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 48% based on reviews from 180 critics, with an average rating of 5.59/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;It has an endearing lack of seriousness, and Vin Diesel has more than enough muscle for the starring role, but ultimately, &quot;XXX&quot; is a missed opportunity to breathe new life into the spy thriller genre.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 48 out of 100, based on reviews from 33 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A− on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it stars out of 4, writing, &quot;In its own punk way, &quot;XXX&quot; is as good as a good Bond movie, and that&#x27;s saying something.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s hard to hate a movie, even one this droolingly crass, that knows how to laugh at itself.&quot; Adam Smith of &quot;Empire&quot; called the movie, &quot;Sporadically entertaining, but seriously hampered by a very choppy screenplay&quot;, and rating it three out of five stars.

This film was nominated for a Razzie Award for Most Flatulent Teen-Targeted Movie, but lost to &quot;&quot;.

<text>The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) is a trade union for coal miners in Great Britain, formed in 1945 from the Miners&#x27; Federation of Great Britain (MFGB). The NUM took part in three national miners&#x27; strikes, in 1972, 1974 and 1984–85. Following the 1984–85 strike, and the subsequent closure of most of Britain&#x27;s coal mines, it became a much smaller union. It had around 170,000 members when Arthur Scargill became leader in 1981, a figure which had fallen in 2023 to an active membership of 82.

==Origins==
The Miners&#x27; Federation of Great Britain was established in Newport, Monmouthshire in 1888 but did not function as a unified, centralised trade union for all miners. Instead the federation represented and co-ordinated the affairs of the existing local and regional miners&#x27; unions whose associations remained largely autonomous. The South Wales Miners&#x27; Federation, founded in 1898, joined the MFGB in 1899, while the Northumberland Miners&#x27; Association and the Durham Miners&#x27; Association joined in 1907 and 1908, respectively.

==Post-1945==
In January 1945, the MFGB was superseded by the National Union of Mineworkers. Within the organisation, each coalfield continued to exercise a degree of autonomy, having its own district association, president, general secretary, and headquarters. Originally, a national strike required a two-thirds majority in a ballot of members, however, this proved near impossible to achieve, and the majority was reduced to 55% in 1970, and to 50% in 1984. Regions of the union could call their own strikes. Different areas varied as to how militant they were, and it was not uncommon for animosity to exist between areas.

On formation, the NUM had the following areas:

The NUM was strongly supportive of the Labour Party. During the first government of Harold Wilson, hundreds of pits closed and thousands of miners left the coal industry but the NUM leadership put up little resistance to the programme. Unofficial strikes were common in the coal industry. Following an unofficial strike in 1969 about the pay of surface workers, it was decided that the threshold for the ballot should be lowered.

The NUM opposed membership of the European Economic Community, beginning with a unanimous conference vote in 1971. During the 1975 referendum, there was a debate within the NUM over the sponsorship giving to Labour MPs in coalfields, given how many of them were campaigning in favour of membership and defying the NUM policy. The Yorkshire Area passed a resolution that tightened the conditions for sponsorship of MPs.

==The Miners&#x27; Strike, 1984–85==
In the 1980s, because many coal mines were overwhelmingly unprofitable, the Conservative government headed by Margaret Thatcher sought to close them and privatise the rest. In some areas, the NUM was militant and threatened strikes in 1981 when the government raised the issue. As the government was not ready for a confrontation, it negotiated a settlement with the union, and backed down from the closures. In what the NUM considered a confrontational move, Ian MacGregor, who had overseen cutbacks and closures at British Steel Corporation, was appointed head of the National Coal Board (NCB) by Thatcher in 1983.

In 1984, after secretly stockpiling coal at power stations, the NCB announced the closure of 20 pits. Local regions organised strikes but NUM President Arthur Scargill, without a national ballot of the union&#x27;s membership, declared a national strike in March 1984, which was ruled illegal in England, making striking miners ineligible for benefits. Support for the strike was not universal; in some areas such as North Wales, support was small but great in others such as South Wales. Also, Yorkshire was more enthusiastic about the strike than Nottinghamshire where many miners refused to strike.

Margaret Thatcher described the strikers as the &quot;enemy within&quot;, but Scargill was equally confrontational. Picket lines were stationed outside the pits and other industrial sites requiring coal and violent clashes with police were common. Strikers had no source of income and some were forced by circumstances to cross the picket lines as reluctant &quot;scabs&quot;. The strike ended on 3 March 1985 and the miners returned to work without agreement with the NCB. The strike was unsuccessful and its failure was an era-defining moment in British politics. Following the strike large numbers of collieries were closed.

The strike&#x27;s effectiveness was reduced because the NUM leaders refused to nationally ballot members on strike action and argued that it was an issue for each area to decide. In some areas that held ballots the majority voted against striking but were subject to picketing from areas that had declared a strike. The strike was deemed illegal by the courts on the basis that the NUM rulebook required a secret ballot for a national strike. Although working miners had instigated the legal action, the NUM leadership presented it as an attack on its right to conduct its own internal affairs. The lack of a ballot reduced public support and made it easier for the government to use legal and police powers against the union without significant political consequences.

The closed shop in the state-owned coal sector was ended when a breakaway union, the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, was formed mostly by miners in Nottinghamshire and South Derbyshire who felt betrayed by the NUM for insisting on a strike after their area ballot had rejected strike action. In contrast, the Leicestershire area stayed in the NUM, as the area leader Jack Jones had kept good relations with the local miners by openly defying Scargill.

After the end of the strike, the NUM took an active leadership role in working to align the labour movement in the UK more closely with LGBT rights issues. Following the Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners campaign of 1984–85, the organisation&#x27;s Welsh chapters participated in London&#x27;s 1985 Lesbian and Gay Pride parade, and at the Labour Party&#x27;s 1985 policy conference, the NUM&#x27;s unanimous block voting support contributed to the successful passage of Composite 26, a resolution which formally committed the party to an LGBT rights platform.

==Decline==
Long based in London, Scargill commissioned a new headquarters building in Sheffield, which was completed in 1988. However, with membership declining, the union relocated again in 1992, to share the Yorkshire Area offices in Barnsley.

Although weakened by the strike, the NUM was still a significant force into the early 1990s. A major scheme of closures of deep mines was announced by the government in 1992. The NUM ran a national ballot on possible strike action, and this was passed by members. It worked with the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers to challenge the closures in the High Court; the court imposed an emergency injunction against the closures and the strike action was called off. However, from mid-1993, the mines started closing; the number of working miners and therefore also the membership of the union continued to fall.

In 2011 the union had 1,855 members. In 2012 the union&#x27;s general secretary, Chris Kitchen, admitted it was in decline after the investigative website Exaro revealed that in 2011 the Derbyshire branch had just one member who was not a paid official. Filings with the Trades Union Certification Officer showed that the NUM&#x27;s Derbyshire branch had just four members, three of whom were paid officials.

In 2012, it emerged in court cases between the NUM and its former president Arthur Scargill that a substantial proportion of union members&#x27; subscriptions was being spent on expenses for Scargill, including unauthorised rent payments for a flat in London&#x27;s Barbican Estate.

A further 540 miners&#x27; job losses were announced in January 2013.

==Areas==
As of 2016, the following area unions are affiliated to the NUM:

*Cokemen
*Colliery Officials and Staffs
*North East
*Northumberland
*Scotland
*South Wales

==Landmark events==
* 1947: nationalisation of 958 coal mines under state control; 400 small mines were left in private hands.
* 1969: a widespread unofficial strike over the pay of surface workers leads to a change in the rules on authorising a national strike: the threshold in a ballot is reduced from two-thirds to 55%.
* 1972: Official national strike. This ended in success after the Battle of Saltley Gate, where the miners&#x27; pickets were supported by solidarity strikes by engineering workers in the Birmingham area.
* 1973–74: Three-Day Week results from an overtime ban from December 1973. A vote by the NUM to strike at the end of January led Prime Minister Edward Heath to call a general election, in which he was defeated. The new government of Harold Wilson accepted the pay demand.
* 1984–85: National strike, which divided the union after the strike motion was rejected in several local ballots and the executive refused to hold a national ballot. After almost a year, the NUM returned to work having won almost no concessions. End of the closed shop with the establishment of the UDM.
* 1994: privatisation of the fifteen state-owned coal mines still in operation, with ownership transferred to the company RJB Mining.

<text>The Diomede Islands (; ), also known in Russia as Gvozdev Islands (), consist of two rocky, mesa-like islands:

* The Russian island of Big Diomede (part of Chukotka), also known as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Inaliq&quot;, &quot;Nunarbuk&quot; or Ratmanov Island
* The U.S. island of Little Diomede (part of Alaska) or &quot;&quot;, also known as Krusenstern Island

The Diomede Islands are located in the middle of the Bering Strait between mainland Alaska and Siberia. If marginal seas are considered, they are the northernmost islands in the Pacific Ocean. To the north is the Chukchi Sea, and to the south is the Bering Sea. Fairway Rock, to the southeast, is also Alaskan but generally not seen as part of the Diomede Islands. Because they are separated by the International Date Line, Big Diomede is almost a day ahead of Little Diomede, but not completely; due to locally defined time zones, Big Diomede is only 21 hours ahead of Little Diomede (20 in summer). Because of this, the islands are sometimes called Tomorrow Island (Big Diomede) and Yesterday Island (Little Diomede).

==Etymology==
The islands are named for the Greek Saint Diomedes; Danish-born Russian navigator Vitus Bering sighted the Diomede Islands on 16 August (O.S., 27 August N.S.) 1728, the day on which the Russian Orthodox Church celebrates the memory of the saint.

==Location==
The islands are separated by an international border, which also defines the International Date Line in that area, about from each island, at 168°58&#x27;37&quot;W. The two islands are about apart at their closest points. The small habitation on Little Diomede Island is centered on the west side of the island at the village of Diomede.

Big Diomede Island is the easternmost point of Russia.

The Diomede Islands are often mentioned as likely intermediate stops for the hypothetical bridge or tunnel (Bering Strait crossing) spanning the Bering Strait.

An ice bridge usually spans the distance between these two islands in winter. At these times, it is theoretically possible (although not legal, since travel between the two islands is forbidden) to walk between the United States and Russia.

==History==

The islands were once mountain tops in the central portion of the land mass known as the Bering land bridge.

The first European to reach the Bering Strait was the Russian explorer Semyon Dezhnev in 1648. He reported two islands whose natives had bone lip ornaments, but it is not certain that these were the Diomedes. Danish navigator Vitus Bering discovered the Diomede Islands while leading a Russian expedition on 16 August (O.S., 26 August N.S.) 1728, the day when the Russian Orthodox Church celebrates the memory of the martyr St. Diomede (hence, the name of the islands). In 1732, a Russian geodesist, Mikhail Gvozdev, determined the longitude and latitude of the two islands.

The text of the 1867 treaty between the United States and Russia, which finalized the Alaska Purchase uses the islands to designate the boundary between the two nations: the border separates &quot;equidistantly Krusenstern Island, or Ignaluk, from Ratmanov Island, or Nunarbuk, and heads northward infinitely until it disappears completely in the Arctic Ocean&quot;.

During the Cold War, that gap constituted the border between the United States and the Soviet Union, and became known as the &quot;Ice Curtain&quot;. In 1987, however, Lynne Cox swam from one island to the other and was congratulated by both Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan for her feat.

In the summer of 1995, British television actor and documentary presenter Michael Palin started his counterclockwise circumnavigation of the Pacific Rim, encompassing 18 countries, on Little Diomede Island, as part of the BBC series &quot;Full Circle&quot;. He intended to set foot on it again at the end of his eight-month trek but could not because of rough seas.

Big Diomede Island was traditionally the easternmost landmass before the International Date Line and the first to ring in a new year if using local solar time. When using official time, however, a large area in eastern Russia and New Zealand also share the same time zone. New Zealand also has daylight saving time in effect during late December, but Russia does not (see time in New Zealand and time in Russia). This became moot in 1995, however, when the International Date Line was moved to the east of Kiribati, and that country&#x27;s easternmost time zone (GMT+14) is now the world&#x27;s earliest.

After establishing a military base there in 1948, the Soviet government relocated the indigenous population of Big Diomede Island to mainland Russia. The island is now inhabited only by military units. Little Diomede had an Inupiat population of 170, which had declined to 115 at the 2010 census, entirely in the village site of Diomede, Alaska on the west side of the island, though the island as a whole comprises the city of Diomede. This village has a school, a post office, and a store. Some residents are famous for their ivory carving. When weather permits, commercial air contact is maintained with the island as part of the US Essential Air Service.

<text>John Robert Cryer, Baron Cryer (born 11 April 1964), is a British politician. A member of the Labour Party, he was previously the Member of Parliament (MP) for Hornchurch from 1997 to 2005 and the MP for Leyton and Wanstead from 2010 to 2024. Cryer was Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party from 2015 to 2024, and was a lord-in-waiting in the House of Lords from 2024 until 2025.

== Early life and career ==
John Robert Cryer was born on 11 April 1964 to Bob Cryer and Ann Cryer (). Both of his parents were Labour Party members of Parliament, and Cryer served alongside his mother in the Commons from 1997 to 2005. As a child, he appeared in the 1970 film &quot;The Railway Children&quot;.

A journalist by profession, Cryer was educated at Oakbank School, Keighley, Hatfield Polytechnic, and the London College of Printing. He has worked for &quot;Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Morning Star&quot;, the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF), and the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union (now Unite).

== Political career ==
Cryer was on the left wing of the Labour Party and was a member of the Socialist Campaign Group until he resigned from the group in 2015. He has subsequently moved to the right of the party, supporting Keir Starmer&#x27;s centrist leadership.

Cryer describes himself as a Eurosceptic, and was one of only a small number of Labour MPs who campaigned and voted for the UK to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum. He consistently opposed holding a second referendum on EU membership.

As Member of Parliament for Hornchurch, Cryer had a record as a rebel. He voted against tuition fees and top-up fees for higher education, against cuts in lone parent benefits (the first major rebellion under the Blair government) and against the Iraq War. He lost this marginal seat in 2005, before being selected to succeed Harry Cohen in Leyton and Wanstead, a safe Labour seat; he comfortably retained it for the party at the 2010 general election.

Cryer was one of 16 signatories of an open letter to Ed Miliband in January 2015 calling on the party to commit to oppose further austerity, take rail franchises back into public ownership and strengthen collective bargaining arrangements.

On 9 February 2015, Cryer was elected, unopposed, to succeed Dave Watts as the Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party.

On 8 May 2015, Cryer was re-elected as MP for the Leyton and Wanstead constituency with 58.6% of the vote. On 8 June 2017, he was re-elected as MP for the Leyton and Wanstead constituency with 69.8% of the vote.

In July 2019, following the BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; programme &quot;Is Labour Antisemitic?&quot;, Cryer condemned his party&#x27;s attack on former staff whistleblowers who had appeared in the programme as &quot;a gross misjudgment&quot;.

Cryer did not seek re-election as an MP at the 2024 general election held in July. After being nominated in the 2024 Dissolution Honours, he was created Baron Cryer, &quot;of Leyton in the London Borough of Waltham Forest&quot;, on 15 August 2024.

== Personal life ==
Cryer&#x27;s second wife is Ellie Reeves, the Labour MP for Lewisham West and Penge – whose sister is Rachel Reeves, also a Labour MP and Chancellor of the Exchequer since 2024. They have two sons, born in 2015 and 2019.

<text>A semitone, also called a minor second, half step, or a half tone, is the smallest musical interval commonly used in Western tonal music, and it is considered the most dissonant when sounded harmonically.
It is defined as the interval between two adjacent notes in a 12-tone scale (or half of a whole step), visually seen on a keyboard as the distance between two keys that are adjacent to each other. For example, C is adjacent to C; the interval between them is a semitone.

In a 12-note approximately equally divided scale, any interval can be defined in terms of an appropriate number of semitones (e.g. a whole tone or major second is 2 semitones wide, a major third 4 semitones, and a perfect fifth 7 semitones).

In music theory, a distinction is made between a diatonic semitone, or minor second (an interval encompassing two different staff positions, e.g. from C to D) and a chromatic semitone or augmented unison (an interval between two notes at the same staff position, e.g. from C to C). These are enharmonically equivalent if and only if twelve-tone equal temperament is used; for example, they are not the same thing in meantone temperament, where the diatonic semitone is distinguished from and larger than the chromatic semitone (augmented unison), or in Pythagorean tuning, where the diatonic semitone is smaller instead. See for more details about this terminology.

In twelve-tone equal temperament all semitones are equal in size (100 cents). In other tuning systems, &quot;semitone&quot; refers to a family of intervals that may vary both in size and name. In Pythagorean tuning, seven semitones out of twelve are diatonic, with ratio 256:243 or 90.2 cents (Pythagorean limma), and the other five are chromatic, with ratio 2187:2048 or 113.7 cents (Pythagorean apotome); they differ by the Pythagorean comma of ratio 531441:524288 or 23.5 cents. In quarter-comma meantone, seven of them are diatonic, and 117.1 cents wide, while the other five are chromatic, and 76.0 cents wide; they differ by the lesser diesis of ratio 128:125 or 41.1 cents. 12-tone scales tuned in just intonation typically define three or four kinds of semitones. For instance, Asymmetric five-limit tuning yields chromatic semitones with ratios 25:24 (70.7 cents) and 135:128 (92.2 cents), and diatonic semitones with ratios 16:15 (111.7 cents) and 27:25 (133.2 cents). For further details, see below.

The condition of having semitones is called hemitonia; that of having no semitones is anhemitonia. A musical scale or chord containing semitones is called hemitonic; one without semitones is anhemitonic.

==Minor second==

The &quot;minor second&quot; occurs in the major scale, between the third and fourth degree, (&quot;mi&quot; (E) and &quot;fa&quot; (F) in C major), and between the seventh and eighth degree (&quot;ti&quot; (B) and &quot;do&quot; (C) in C major). It is also called the &quot;diatonic semitone&quot; because it occurs between steps in the diatonic scale. The minor second is abbreviated m2 (or −2). Its inversion is the &quot;major seventh&quot; (&quot;M7&quot; or &quot;Ma7&quot;).

. Here, middle C is followed by D, which is a tone 100 cents sharper than C, and then by both tones together.

Melodically, this interval is very frequently used, and is of particular importance in cadences. In the perfect and deceptive cadences it appears as a resolution of the leading-tone to the tonic. In the plagal cadence, it appears as the falling of the subdominant to the mediant. It also occurs in many forms of the imperfect cadence, wherever the tonic falls to the leading-tone.

Harmonically, the interval usually occurs as some form of dissonance or a nonchord tone that is not part of the functional harmony. It may also appear in inversions of a major seventh chord, and in many added tone chords.

In unusual situations, the minor second can add a great deal of character to the music. For instance, Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s Étude Op. 25, No. 5 opens with a melody accompanied by a line that plays fleeting minor seconds. These are used to humorous and whimsical effect, which contrasts with its more lyrical middle section. This eccentric dissonance has earned the piece its nickname: the &quot;wrong note&quot; étude. This kind of usage of the minor second appears in many other works of the Romantic period, such as Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Ballet of the Unhatched Chicks&quot;. More recently, the music to the movie &quot;Jaws&quot; exemplifies the minor second.

===In other temperaments===
In just intonation a 16:15 minor second arises in the C major scale between B &amp; C and E &amp; F, and is &quot;the sharpest dissonance found in the [major] scale.&quot; 

==Augmented unison==

The augmented unison, the interval produced by the augmentation, or widening by one half step, of the perfect unison, does not occur between diatonic scale steps, but instead between a scale step and a chromatic alteration of the same step. It is also called a &quot;chromatic semitone&quot;. The augmented unison is abbreviated A1, or aug 1. Its inversion is the &quot;diminished octave&quot; (&quot;d8&quot;, or &quot;dim 8&quot;). The augmented unison is also the inversion of the augmented octave, because the interval of the diminished unison does not exist. This is because a unison is always made larger when one note of the interval is changed with an accidental.

Melodically, an augmented unison very frequently occurs when proceeding to a chromatic chord, such as a secondary dominant, a diminished seventh chord, or an augmented sixth chord. Its use is also often the consequence of a melody proceeding in semitones, regardless of harmonic underpinning, e.g. D, D, E, F, F. (Restricting the notation to only minor seconds is impractical, as the same example would have a rapidly increasing number of accidentals, written enharmonically as D, E, F, G, A).
Harmonically, augmented unisons are quite rare in tonal repertoire. In the example to the right, Liszt had written an E against an E in the bass. Here E was preferred to a D to make the tone&#x27;s function clear as part of an F dominant seventh chord, and the augmented unison is the result of superimposing this harmony upon an E pedal point.

In addition to this kind of usage, harmonic augmented unisons are frequently written in modern works involving tone clusters, such as Iannis Xenakis&#x27; &quot;Evryali&quot; for piano solo.

==History==

The semitone appeared in the music theory of Greek antiquity as part of a diatonic or chromatic tetrachord, and it has always had a place in the diatonic scales of Western music since. The various modal scales of medieval music theory were all based upon this diatonic pattern of tones and semitones.

Though it would later become an integral part of the musical cadence, in the early polyphony of the 11th century this was not the case. Guido of Arezzo suggested instead in his &quot;Micrologus&quot; other alternatives: either proceeding by whole tone from a major second to a unison, or an &quot;occursus&quot; having two notes at a major third move by contrary motion toward a unison, each having moved a whole tone.

&quot;As late as the 13th century the half step was experienced as a problematic interval not easily understood, as the irrational remainder between the perfect fourth and the ditone formula_1.&quot; In a melodic half step, no &quot;tendency was perceived of the lower tone toward the upper, or of the upper toward the lower. The second tone was not taken to be the &#x27;goal&#x27; of the first. Instead, the half step was avoided in clausulae because it lacked clarity as an interval.&quot;
However, beginning in the 13th century cadences begin to require motion in one voice by half step and the other a whole step in contrary motion. These cadences would become a fundamental part of the musical language, even to the point where the usual accidental accompanying the minor second in a cadence was often omitted from the written score (a practice known as musica ficta). By the 16th century, the semitone had become a more versatile interval, sometimes even appearing as an augmented unison in very chromatic passages. Semantically, in the 16th century the repeated melodic semitone became associated with weeping, see: passus duriusculus, lament bass, and pianto.

By the Baroque era (1600 to 1750), the tonal harmonic framework was fully formed, and the various musical functions of the semitone were rigorously understood. Later in this period the adoption of well temperaments for instrumental tuning and the more frequent use of enharmonic equivalences increased the ease with which a semitone could be applied. Its function remained similar through the Classical period, and though it was used more frequently as the language of tonality became more chromatic in the Romantic period, the musical function of the semitone did not change.

In the 20th century, however, composers such as Arnold Schoenberg, Béla Bartók, and Igor Stravinsky sought alternatives or extensions of tonal harmony, and found other uses for the semitone. Often the semitone was exploited harmonically as a caustic dissonance, having no resolution. Some composers would even use large collections of harmonic semitones (tone clusters) as a source of cacophony in their music (e.g. the early piano works of Henry Cowell). By now, enharmonic equivalence was a commonplace property of equal temperament, and instrumental use of the semitone was not at all problematic for the performer. The composer was free to write semitones wherever he wished.

==Semitones in different tunings==

The exact size of a semitone depends on the tuning system used. Meantone temperaments have two distinct types of semitones, but in the exceptional case of equal temperament, there is only one. The unevenly distributed well temperaments contain many different semitones. Pythagorean tuning, similar to meantone tuning, has two, but in other systems of just intonation there are many more possibilities.

===Meantone temperament===

In meantone systems, there are two different semitones. This results because of the break in the circle of fifths that occurs in the tuning system: diatonic semitones derive from a chain of five fifths that does not cross the break, and chromatic semitones come from one that does.

The chromatic semitone is usually smaller than the diatonic. In the common quarter-comma meantone, tuned as a cycle of tempered fifths from E to G, the chromatic and diatonic semitones are 76.0 and 117.1 cents wide respectively.

Extended meantone temperaments with more than 12 notes still retain the same two semitone sizes, but there is more flexibility for the musician about whether to use an augmented unison or minor second. 31-tone equal temperament is the most flexible of these, which makes an unbroken circle of 31 fifths, allowing the choice of semitone to be made for any pitch.

===Equal temperament===

12-tone equal temperament is a form of meantone tuning in which the diatonic and chromatic semitones are exactly the same, because its circle of fifths has no break. Each semitone is equal to one twelfth of an octave. This is a ratio of 21/12 (approximately 1.05946), or 100 cents, and is 11.7 cents narrower than the 16:15 ratio (its most common form in just intonation, discussed below).

All diatonic intervals can be expressed as an equivalent number of semitones. For instance a major sixth equals nine semitones.

There are many approximations, rational or otherwise, to the equal-tempered semitone. To cite a few:
:*formula_2suggested by Vincenzo Galilei and used by luthiers of the Renaissance,

:*formula_3suggested by Marin Mersenne as a constructible and more accurate alternative,

:*formula_4used by Julián Carrillo as part of a sixteenth-tone system.

For more examples, see Pythagorean and Just systems of tuning below.

===Well temperament===
There are many forms of well temperament, but the characteristic they all share is that their semitones are of an uneven size. Every semitone in a well temperament has its own interval (usually close to the equal-tempered version of 100 cents), and there is no clear distinction between a &quot;diatonic&quot; and &quot;chromatic&quot; semitone in the tuning. Well temperament was constructed so that enharmonic equivalence could be assumed between all of these semitones, and whether they were written as a minor second or augmented unison did not effect a different sound. Instead, in these systems, each key had a slightly different sonic color or character, beyond the limitations of conventional notation.

===Pythagorean tuning===

Like meantone temperament, Pythagorean tuning is a broken circle of fifths. This creates two distinct semitones, but because Pythagorean tuning is also a form of 3-limit just intonation, these semitones are rational. Also, unlike most meantone temperaments, the chromatic semitone is larger than the diatonic.

The Pythagorean diatonic semitone has a ratio of 256/243 (), and is often called the Pythagorean limma. It is also sometimes called the &quot;Pythagorean minor semitone&quot;. It is about 90.2 cents.
:formula_5

It can be thought of as the difference between three octaves and five just fifths, and functions as a diatonic semitone in a Pythagorean tuning.

The Pythagorean chromatic semitone has a ratio of 2187/2048 (). It is about 113.7 cents. It may also be called the Pythagorean apotome or the &quot;Pythagorean major semitone&quot;. (&quot;See Pythagorean interval&quot;.)
:formula_6

It can be thought of as the difference between four perfect octaves and seven just fifths, and functions as a chromatic semitone in a Pythagorean tuning.

The Pythagorean limma and Pythagorean apotome are enharmonic equivalents (chromatic semitones) and only a Pythagorean comma apart, in contrast to diatonic and chromatic semitones in meantone temperament and 5-limit just intonation.

===Just 5-limit intonation ===


A minor second in just intonation typically corresponds to a pitch ratio of 16:15 () or 1.0666... (approximately 111.7 cents), called the just diatonic semitone. This is a practical just semitone, since it is the interval that occurs twice within the diatonic scale between a:
: major third (5:4) and perfect fourth (4:3) formula_7 and a
: major seventh (15:8) and the perfect octave (2:1) formula_8

The 16:15 just minor second arises in the C major scale between B &amp; C and E &amp; F, and is, &quot;the sharpest dissonance found in the scale&quot;.

An &quot;augmented unison&quot; (sharp) in just intonation is a different, smaller semitone, with frequency ratio 25:24 () or 1.0416... (approximately 70.7 cents). It is the interval between a major third (5:4) and a minor third (6:5). In fact, it is the spacing between the minor and major thirds, sixths, and sevenths (but not necessarily the major and minor second). Composer Ben Johnston used a sharp () to indicate a note is raised 70.7 cents, or a flat () to indicate a note is lowered 70.7 cents. (This is the standard practice for just intonation, but not for all other microtunings.)

Two other kinds of semitones are produced by 5 limit tuning. A chromatic scale defines 12 semitones as the 12 intervals between the 13 adjacent notes, spanning a full octave (e.g. from C to C). The 12 semitones produced by a commonly used version of 5 limit tuning have four different sizes, and can be classified as follows:

; Just chromatic semitone : &quot;chromatic semitone&quot;, or &quot;smaller&quot;, or &quot;minor chromatic semitone&quot; between harmonically related flats and sharps e.g. between E and E (6:5 and 5:4):
: formula_9
; Larger chromatic semitone : or &quot;major chromatic semitone&quot;, or &quot;larger limma&quot;, or &quot;major chroma&quot;, e.g. between C and an accute C (C raised by a syntonic comma) (1:1 and 135:128):
: formula_10
; Just diatonic semitone: or &quot;smaller&quot;, or &quot;minor diatonic semitone&quot;, e.g. between E and F (5:4 to 4:3):
: formula_11
; Larger diatonic semitone: or &quot;greater&quot; or &quot;major diatonic semitone&quot;, e.g. between A and B (5:3 to 9:5), or C and chromatic D (27:25), or F and G (25:18 and 3:2):
: formula_12

The most frequently occurring semitones are the just ones (, 16:15, and , 25:24): S occurs at 6 short intervals out of 12, 3 times, twice, and at only one interval (if diatonic D replaces chromatic D and sharp notes are not used).

The smaller chromatic and diatonic semitones differ from the larger by the syntonic comma (81:80 or 21.5 cents). The smaller and larger chromatic semitones differ from the respective diatonic semitones by the same 128:125 diesis as the above meantone semitones. Finally, while the inner semitones differ by the diaschisma (2048:2025 or 19.6 cents), the outer differ by the greater diesis (648:625 or 62.6 cents).

===Extended just intonations===
In 7 limit tuning there is the septimal diatonic semitone of 15:14 () available in between the 5 limit major seventh (15:8) and the 7 limit minor seventh / harmonic seventh (7:4). There is also a smaller septimal chromatic semitone of 21:20 () between a septimal minor seventh and a fifth (21:8) and an octave and a major third (5:2). Both are more rarely used than their 5 limit neighbours, although the former was often implemented by theorist Cowell, while Partch used the latter as part of his 43 tone scale.

Under 11 limit tuning, there is a fairly common &quot;undecimal neutral second&quot; (12:11) (), but it lies on the boundary between the minor and major second (150.6 cents). In just intonation there are infinitely many possibilities for intervals that fall within the range of the semitone (e.g. the Pythagorean semitones mentioned above), but most of them are impractical.

In 13 limit tuning, there is a tridecimal tone (13:12 or 138.57 cents) and tridecimal tone (27:26 or 65.34 cents).

In 17 limit just intonation, the major diatonic semitone is 15:14 or 119.4 cents (), and the minor diatonic semitone is 17:16 or 105.0 cents, and septendecimal limma is 18:17 or 98.95 cents.

Though the names &quot;diatonic&quot; and &quot;chromatic&quot; are often used for these intervals, their musical function is not the same as the meantone semitones. For instance, 15:14 would usually be written as an augmented unison, functioning as the &quot;chromatic&quot; counterpart to a &quot;diatonic&quot; 16:15. These distinctions are highly dependent on the musical context, and just intonation is not particularly well suited to chromatic use (diatonic semitone function is more prevalent).

===Other equal temperaments===

19-tone equal temperament distinguishes between the chromatic and diatonic semitones; in this tuning, the chromatic semitone is one step of the scale (), and the diatonic semitone is two (). 31-tone equal temperament also distinguishes between these two intervals, which become 2 and 3 steps of the scale, respectively. 53-ET has an even closer match to the two semitones with 3 and 5 steps of its scale while 72-ET uses 4 () and 7 () steps of its scale.

In general, because the smaller semitone can be viewed as the difference between a minor third and a major third, and the larger as the difference between a major third and a perfect fourth, tuning systems that closely match those just intervals (6/5, 5/4, and 4/3) will also distinguish between the two types of semitones and closely match their just intervals (25/24 and 16/15).

<text>A study circle is a small group of people who meet multiple times to discuss an issue. Study circles may be formed to discuss anything from politics to religion to hobbies with a minimum of 7 people to a maximum of 15. These study circles are formed by a study circle organiser, and are led by a study circle leader. Study circle doesn&#x27;t have a teacher. They are differentiated from clubs by their focus on exploring an issue or topic rather than on activities or socializing. When they emerged in the early twentieth century they were based on a democratic approach to self-education and were often linked to social movements concerned with temperance or working class emancipation.

==Basics==
Study circles are typically created by persons who discover a common interest; other study circles may be created to analyze and find solutions to social, political, or community problems.

Often there is no teacher, but one member usually acts as facilitator to keep discussion flowing and on track, and ensure that everyone has an opportunity to become as involved as he or she desires to be. Reading material and audio/visual aids are often used to stimulate dialogue.

Study circles may be introductory level, advanced level, or any level in between. Study circles may be sponsored or assisted by government or community officials and have specific outcome goals such as generating ideas or suggesting courses of action; or they may be entirely independent and self-sufficient, existing simply for the pleasure of increasing the knowledge of their members.

While there is no one right way to do a study circle, organizations such as Everyday Democracy (formerly the Study Circles Resource Center) have published simple and suitable dialogue methods for creating deeper understanding, for weighing options and making choices, or for making recommendations that lead to action.

Study circles allow complex topics to be broken down into manageable parts. Single session programs can result in meaningful and productive dialogue, but study circles usually involve multiple sessions in order to fully investigate the question at hand. However, a study by Staffan Larson in 2001 concluded that while study circles foster participation they are only partly successful as civic change vehicles since their power to influence social action can be weak.

==History and evolution==
In the early 19th century, Danish Lutheran pastor N. F. S. Grundtvig envisioned folk high schools that rapidly spread through Scandinavia and Central Europe. Forms of informal education such as folk high schools and popular lectures (such as Chautauqua) helped inspire the development of study circles in Sweden in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a part of the activities in popular movements, such as the temperance and the workers&#x27; movements. Oscar Olsson was a prominent Swedish proponent of study circles. Since these movements&#x27; participants were working class or small farmers the study circles were important in relation to these classes&#x27; growing political power in the early 20th century. The issues that were studied were already from the early period broad—they could be as well political and social issues as literature or even school topics.

In Sweden today study circles are a mass phenomenon and have broad national support. Around 300,000 study circles have been reported each year since the 1970s. National educational associations receive annual subsidies from the national government and work with folk high schools (folkhögskolor), university short courses, correspondence study and distance learning, allowing citizens to understand and participate more fully in their communities and nation. The Swedish study circle model was successfully transplanted into American culture, most notably in the National Issues Forums (sponsored by the Domestic Policy Association in Dayton, Ohio) and the Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen&#x27;s Study Circle Program which began in 1986.

Narodnaya Volya (&quot;People&#x27;s Will&quot;), a Russian revolutionary populist organisation, made extensive use of study circles in the 1870s. The concept was taken up by the Georgian Social Democrat group Mesame Dasi (&quot;Third Group&quot;) in the 1890s. A youthful Joseph Stalin was involved in leading some of these.

Study circles have been employed as a change process and development activity within corporations. Some of the same ideas and concepts of community study circles can be applied to internal issues such as diversity and race relations.

Study circles have been used extensively in Australia for some years to engage citizens in issues as diverse as reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, and tackling environmental disasters like blue-green algae in the nation&#x27;s river systems. Around 2010, the Australian Study Circles Network was developed as a central resource for study circle practitioners in Australia.

<doc id="415175" wikidata="Q178166" url="?curid=415175" title="Vin Diesel">
<text>Mark Sinclair (born July 18, 1967), known professionally as Vin Diesel, is an American actor and film producer. One of the world&#x27;s highest-grossing actors, he is best known for portraying Dominic Toretto in the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; franchise.

Born in California, Diesel attended NYC&#x27;s Hunter College, where studies in creative writing led him to begin screenwriting. He wrote, directed, produced, and starred in the short drama film &quot;Multi-Facial&quot; (1995) and his debut feature &quot;Strays&quot; (1997). He came to prominence in the late 1990s, and first became known for appearing in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; in 1998. He followed up with commercially successful films such as &quot;Boiler Room&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Pacifier&quot; (2005). He gained stardom as a leading action star headlining numerous franchises, including &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot;, &quot;XXX&quot;, and &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot;.

His voice acting work includes &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; (1999), the video games &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena&quot; (2009), and the voices of Groot I and Groot II in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU); he portrayed the characters in six superhero films, beginning with &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; (2014). Diesel has reprised his role as Groot for the Disney+ animated shorts series &quot;I Am Groot&quot; (2022–2023), the television special &quot;The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special&quot; (2022), and the animated film &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot; (2018).

He founded the production company One Race Films, where he has also served as a producer or executive producer for his star vehicles. Diesel also founded the record label Racetrack Records and video game developer Tigon Studios, providing his voice and motion capture for all of Tigon&#x27;s releases.

==Early life==

Diesel was born Mark Sinclair on July 18, 1967, in Alameda County, California, where his mother was also born, though later moved to New York City with his fraternal twin brother, Paul. His mother, Delora Sherleen Vincent (née Sinclair), is an astrologer. He was raised by his white mother and adoptive African-American father, Irving H. Vincent, an acting instructor and theater manager. Diesel has stated that he is &quot;of ambiguous ethnicity.&quot; His mother has Scottish roots. He has never met his biological father, and has said that &quot;all I know from my mother is that I have connections to many different cultures&quot;; Diesel believes that his parents&#x27; relationship would have been illegal in parts of the United States due to anti-miscegenation laws.

Diesel made his stage debut at age seven when he appeared in the children&#x27;s play &quot;Dinosaur Door&quot;, written by Barbara Garson. The play was produced at Theater for the New City in New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village. His involvement in the play came about when he, his brother and some friends had broken into the Theater for the New City space on Jane Street with the intent to vandalize it. They were confronted by the theater&#x27;s artistic director, Crystal Field, who offered them roles in the upcoming show instead of calling the police. Diesel remained involved with the theater throughout adolescence, going on to attend NYC&#x27;s Hunter College, where studies in creative writing led him to begin screenwriting. He has identified himself as a &quot;multi-faceted&quot; actor.

Sinclair began going by his stage name &quot;Vin Diesel&quot; while working as a bouncer at the New York nightclub Tunnel, wanting a tougher sounding name for his occupation. Vin comes from his mother&#x27;s married last name Vincent, while the surname Diesel came from his friends due to his tendency to be energetic.

==Career==
Diesel&#x27;s first film role was as an uncredited extra in the drama film &quot;Awakenings&quot; in 1990. After several years of struggle to gain acting roles, Diesel decided to make his own short film to secure funds for his feature film debut. In 1994, he wrote, directed, produced, and starred in the short drama film &quot;Multi-Facial&quot;, a semi-autobiographical film which follows a struggling multiracial actor stuck in the audition process. The film was selected for screening at the 1995 Cannes Festival. As well as acting, Vin Diesel supported himself by working as a bouncer and telemarketer selling lightbulbs.

In 1997, Diesel secured funds to make his first feature-length film, &quot;Strays&quot;, an urban drama in which he played a gang leader whose love for a woman inspires him to try to change his ways. Written, directed, and produced by Diesel, the film was selected for competition at the 1997 Sundance Festival, leading to an MTV deal to turn it into a series which never came to fruition. Director Steven Spielberg took notice of Diesel after seeing him in &quot;Multi-Facial&quot; and cast him in a small role as a soldier in his 1998 Oscar-winning war film &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. This marked Diesel&#x27;s first major Hollywood film role. In 1999, he provided the voice of the title character in the animated film &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;.

In 2000, Diesel had a supporting role in the drama thriller &quot;Boiler Room&quot;, where he appeared alongside Giovanni Ribisi and Ben Affleck. He got his breakthrough leading role as the anti-hero Riddick in the science-fiction film &quot;Pitch Black&quot; later that year.

Diesel attained action hero stardom with his portrayal of Dominic Toretto in the street racing action film &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; (2001) and as Xander Cage in the action thriller &quot;XXX&quot; (2002). He turned down the chance to reprise his roles in the sequels &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; (2003) and &quot;&quot; (2005). Instead he chose to reprise his role as Riddick in &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot; (2004), which was a box office failure considering the large budget. He also voiced the character in two spin-off video games and the anime film &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury&quot;.

In a departure from his previous tough guy action hero persona, in 2005, he played a lighthearted role in the action comedy film &quot;The Pacifier&quot;, which was a box office success.

In 2006, he chose a dramatic role playing real-life mobster Jack DiNorscio in &quot;Find Me Guilty&quot;. Although he received critical acclaim for his performance, the film did poorly at the box office grossing only $2 million against a budget of $13 million. Later that year, Diesel made a cameo appearance in &quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&quot;, reprising his role from &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;.
In 2007, Diesel was set to produce and star as Agent 47 in the film adaptation of the video game &quot;&quot;, but eventually pulled back and served as executive producer on the film instead. In 2008, he starred in the science-fiction action thriller &quot;Babylon A.D.&quot; which was a critical and box office failure. Diesel returned to the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; series, alongside most of the principal cast from the original 2001 film, in &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot;, which was released in April 2009.

Diesel reprised his role as Dominic Toretto in later installments of the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; franchise, &quot;Fast Five&quot; (2011), &quot;Fast &amp; Furious 6&quot; (2013), &quot;Furious 7&quot; (2015), &quot;The Fate of the Furious&quot; (2017), &quot;F9&quot; (2021) and the most recent entry, &quot;Fast X&quot; (2023). He reprised his role as Riddick in the third film of &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot; series, simply titled &quot;Riddick&quot; (2013). In August 2013, Diesel received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He voiced Groot in the 2014 Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;.

In 2015, he starred in the supernatural action film &quot;The Last Witch Hunter&quot;. In 2016, Diesel appeared as a supporting character in Ang Lee&#x27;s war drama &quot;Billy Lynn&#x27;s Long Halftime Walk&quot;.

In 2017, Diesel also reprised his roles as Xander Cage in &quot;&quot;, and Groot in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot;. Over the course of several years, Diesel has discussed playing two separate roles within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In November 2016 director of &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, James Gunn, confirmed that Diesel had been in talks to play Blackagar Boltagon / Black Bolt for the planned &quot;Inhumans&quot; film, but it was turned into a television series instead without Diesel involved.

Diesel reprised his role of Groot once again in the crossover films &quot;&quot; (2018) and &quot;&quot; (2019) which combined the superhero teams of Guardians of the Galaxy and The Avengers. He has said, &quot;[I] think there&#x27;s gonna be a moment that we&#x27;re all waiting for, and whether you know it or not, you are waiting to see [Groot] and [the Hulk] get down.&quot;

Diesel portrayed Valiant Comics character &quot;Bloodshot&quot; in the film of the same name which released in March 2020.

In September 2020, Diesel announced his venture into music, with the release of the song &quot;Feel Like I Do&quot;, produced by Kygo. He debuted the song on &quot;The Kelly Clarkson Show&quot; on September 24, stating: &quot;I am blessed that on a year that I would normally be on a movie set — and as you know, that&#x27;s not possible — I&#x27;ve had another creative outlet. Another way to show you, or share with you, my heart.&quot;

Diesel will appear in &quot;Riddick: Furya&quot;, the fourth installment of &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot; franchise, announced in February 2023.

==Personal life==
Diesel has said he prefers to maintain his privacy regarding his personal life, stating: &quot;I&#x27;m not gonna put it out there on a magazine cover like some other actors. I come from the Harrison Ford, Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino code of silence.&quot;

Diesel is noted for his distinctive deep voice. He said his voice broke around age 15, giving him a mature-sounding voice on the telephone, which he often uses for his acting performances.

Diesel is a longtime &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fan, and wrote the foreword for &quot;30 Years of Adventure: A Celebration of Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (2004). Canadian video game designer and developer merritt k created the 2015 ASMR game &quot;Vin Diesel DMing a Game of D&amp;D Just for You&quot; for him. He has expressed his love for the Dominican Republic and how he relates to its multicultural facets. He is acquainted with its former president, Leonel Fernández, and appeared in one of Fernández&#x27;s earlier campaign advertisements. He later secured film production in the country for &quot;Los Bandoleros&quot; and &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; (both 2009).

=== Relationships ===
Sometime around 2001, Diesel dated his &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; co-star Michelle Rodriguez. Since 2007, he has been in a relationship with Mexican model Paloma Jimenez; the couple have three children, two daughters born in April 2008 and March 2015, and a son born 2010. The younger daughter is named in honor of his co-star and close friend Paul Walker, who died in November 2013. He is also the godfather of Walker&#x27;s daughter, Meadow. Diesel also shares a close friendship with &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; co-star Tyrese Gibson.

=== Legal issues ===
In December 2023, former assistant Asta Jonasson sued Diesel for sexual battery and retaliation. The lawsuit alleges that, in 2010 during the filming of &quot;Fast Five&quot; in Atlanta, he brought her to his suite at the St. Regis Hotel and forced her onto his bed. Jonasson accuses him of &quot;forcibly grabbing [her] and groping her breasts, and kissing her chest... and trying to pull down her underwear&quot;. She further accused him of pressing her against the wall and forcing her to touch his erect penis, and then he began to masturbate. She was fired a few days later which she believes was retaliatory with the suit reading, &quot;It was clear to her that she was being fired because she was no longer useful—Vin Diesel had used her to fulfill his sexual desires and she had resisted his sexual assaults&quot;. The lawsuit also names Diesel&#x27;s sister and production company as defendants for allegedly creating a hostile work environment and wrongfully terminating her, among other complaints. Shortly after the suit was filed, Diesel&#x27;s lawyer announced that Diesel &quot;categorically denies this claim in its entirety.&quot; In March 2024, Diesel filed a court response requesting dismissal of the suit. He also asked the court to require Jonasson to pay his legal fees.

<doc id="415176" wikidata="Q5485932" url="?curid=415176" title="Frank Cook (politician)">
<text>Francis Cook (3 November 1935 – 10 January 2012) was a British Labour and later independent politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Stockton North from 1983 until 2010.

==Background==
Cook was born in West Hartlepool and was educated at the Corby School (Sunderland), the De la Salle College (Manchester) and the Institute of Education (Leeds). Before his election to the Commons, Cook worked variously as a gravedigger, a Butlins Redcoat, a transport manager at a steelworks, a teacher, and a construction planning engineer.

==Parliament==
He was selected to contest Stockton North at the 1983 general election, securing the nomination following the defection of the sitting Labour MP Bill Rodgers who was one of the original Gang of Four who set up the Social Democratic Party in 1981. Cook won the seat with a majority of 1,870, with Rodgers finishing in third place behind the Conservative candidate.

He served as Opposition whip under Neil Kinnock from 1987 to 1992. He was a member of the Speaker&#x27;s Panel of Chairmen in the 2005–10 parliament. He was a leading opponent of gun control following the Dunblane massacre in 1996. It was reported that he once asked Conservative MP Andrew MacKay to &quot;step outside for a fight&quot;.

In the 2005 political year, the Public Whip found Cook to be the 38th most rebellious MP (out of 635). He had recently become known for his dissent concerning the controversial ID Cards and Racial and Religious Hatred Bill. He had the large former ICI site at Billingham in his constituency and was a supporter of Hartlepool FC.

===2010 general election===
In January 2008, Cook (a member of the Socialist Campaign Group) was de-selected by his local constituency Labour Party when choosing its candidate for the next general election in favour of Alex Cunningham. In April 2010 he announced that he would stand as an independent in the general election. In the 2010 general election, he stood as an independent, coming in fifth behind Cunningham (Labour 16,923; 42.8%), Ian Galletley (Conservative 10,247; 25.9%), Philip Latham (Liberal Democrat 6,342; 16.1%), and James MacPherson (British National Party 1,724; 4.4%). Cook received 1,577 votes, 4.0%, and lost his deposit.

===£5 expense claim===
In May 2009, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; revealed he had tried to reclaim, as an expense, the £5 that an assistant had donated during a service at Stockton Parish Church to commemorate the Battle of Britain. The Fees Office rejected his claim. Cook said that he had made the claim by mistake after reimbursing his assistant, and subsequently sued the newspaper for libel. He lost the case when the &quot;Telegraph&quot; submitted a defence of fair comment, and Cook could not prove malice.

==Personal life==
Cook married Patricia Lundrigan in 1959; the couple had three daughters and a son. He was still married to his first wife, Patricia, when he met Princess Somsangouane Baldinger of the Lao royal family at the 1992 Billingham folklore festival. He and Lundrigan divorced, and he remarried to Baldinger.

In an interview in 2008 with the &quot;Evening Gazette&quot;, he said his second wife was &quot;almost too perfect&quot;; &quot;She&#x27;s a wonderful artist and a lady of considerable skill and merit ... Do you know, she&#x27;s never made me the same meal twice since we met.&quot;

==Death==
Cook was diagnosed with lung cancer in early 2011 and died aged 76 at North Tees Hospital, Stockton, on 10 January 2012.

<text>The Doak Walker Award honors the top running back in college football in the United States. Established in 1990, it is named in honor of Doak Walker, a former running back who played for the SMU Mustangs from 1945 to 1949 and in the National Football League (NFL) for the Detroit Lions from 1950 to 1955. The player is selected by the award&#x27;s National Selection Committee, which consists of notable sportswriters, television commentators, analysts, radio sports personalities and former All-America and NFL All-Pro football players. Recipients receive a bronze sculpture of Doak Walker, designed by artist Blair Buswell.

==Notable Accomplishments==
Wisconsin running backs won four times in eight years from 2012 to 2019. Wisconsin and Texas are tied with the most wins with 5 apiece.

Ricky Williams (Texas – 1997, 1998), Darren McFadden (Arkansas – 2006, 2007) and Jonathan Taylor (Wisconsin – 2018, 2019) are the only three players to win the award more than once.

He was elected as the MP there at the 1992 General Election following the retirement of Allen McKay, holding the seat with a majority of 14,504. He made his maiden speech, speaking on the concerns in the local coal mining industry, on 6 May 1992.

Clapham is a left-winger and was a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, rebelling against the government on various issues. He was a member of the Trade and Industry Committee from 1992 to 1997 and again from 2003; in between he was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Alan Milburn following the 1997 general election, but he resigned over Harriet Harman&#x27;s decision to cut lone parent benefits in December of that year. He used to be very loyal to his old boss Arthur Scargill, but later criticised him for being too Stalinist.

His voting record shows him to be against many of Tony Blair&#x27;s policies, including ID cards, student top-up fees and the Iraq war.

Clapham announced he would stand down at the next general election; his constituency became part of the new constituency of Penistone and Stocksbridge.

==Personal life==
Clapham is a Distinguished Supporter of Humanists UK. He is also a supporter of Republic, a campaign to replace the British monarchy with an elected head of state. He has been married to Yvonne Hallsworth since 1965 and they have a son and a daughter.

<text>In music theory, a third is a musical interval encompassing three staff positions (see Interval number for more details), and the major third () is a third spanning four half steps or two whole steps. Along with the minor third, the major third is one of two commonly occurring thirds. It is described as &quot;major&quot; because it is the larger interval of the two: The major third spans four semitones, whereas the minor third only spans three. For example, the interval from C to E is a major third, as the note E lies four semitones above C, and there are three staff positions from C to E.

Diminished and augmented thirds are shown on the musical staff the same number of lines and spaces apart, but contain a different number of semitones in pitch (two and five).

== Harmonic and non-harmonic thirds ==
The major third may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the fourth and fifth harmonics. 
The major scale is so named because of the presence of this interval between its tonic and mediant (1st and 3rd) scale degrees. 
The major chord also takes its name from the presence of this interval built on the chord&#x27;s root (provided that the interval of a perfect fifth from the root is also present).

A major third is slightly different in different musical tunings: In just intonation it corresponds to a pitch ratio of 5:4, or () (fifth harmonic in relation to the fourth) or 386.31 cents; in 12 tone equal temperament, a major third is equal to four semitones, a ratio of 21/3:1 (about 1.2599) or 400 cents, 13.69 cents wider than the 5:4 ratio. The older concept of a &quot;ditone&quot; (two 9:8 major seconds) made a dissonant, wide major third with the ratio 81:64 (about 1.2656) or 408 cents (), about 22 cents sharp from the harmonic ratio of 5:4 . The septimal major third is 9:7 (435 cents), the undecimal major third is 14:11 (418 cents), and the tridecimal major third is 13:10 (452 cents).

In 12 tone equal temperament three major thirds in a row are equal to an octave. For example, &amp;hairsp; A to C, &amp;hairsp; C to E, and &amp;hairsp; E to G (in the differently written notes G and A both represent the same pitch, but &quot;not&quot; in most other tuning systems). This is sometimes called the &quot;circle of thirds&quot;. In just intonation, however, three 5:4 major third, the 125th subharmonic, is less than an octave. For example, three 5:4 major thirds from C is B (C to E, to G, to B) ( formula_1). The difference between this just-tuned B and C, like the interval between G and A, is called the &quot;enharmonic diesis&quot;, about 41 cents, or about two commas (the inversion of the interval : formula_2 ()).

== Consonance vs. dissonance ==
The major third is classed as an imperfect consonance and is considered one of the most consonant intervals after the unison, octave, perfect fifth, and perfect fourth. In the common practice period, thirds were considered interesting and dynamic consonances along with their inverses the sixths, but in medieval times they were considered dissonances unusable in a stable final sonority.

In equal temperament, a diminished fourth is enharmonically equivalent to a major third (that is, it spans the same number of semitones). For example, B–D is a major third; but if the same pitches are spelled as the notes B and E, then the interval they represent is instead a diminished fourth. The difference in pitch is erased in 12 tone equal temperament, where the distinction is only nominal, but the difference between a major third and a diminished fourth is significant in almost all other musical tuning systems. B–E occurs in the C harmonic minor scale.

The major third is used in guitar tunings. For the standard tuning, only the interval between the 3rd and 2nd strings (G to B, respectively) is a major third; each of the intervals between the other pairs of consecutive strings is a perfect fourth. In an alternative tuning, the major-thirds tuning, &quot;each&quot; of the intervals are major thirds.

<text>In music theory, a minor third is a musical interval that encompasses three half steps, or semitones. Staff notation represents the minor third as encompassing three staff positions (see: interval number). The minor third is one of two commonly occurring thirds. It is called &quot;minor&quot; because it is the smaller of the two: the major third spans an additional semitone. For example, the interval from A to C is a minor third, as the note C lies three semitones above A. Coincidentally, there are three staff positions from A to C. Diminished and augmented thirds span the same number of staff positions, but consist of a different number of semitones (two and five). The minor third is a skip melodically.

Notable examples of ascending minor thirds include the opening two notes of &quot;Greensleeves&quot; and of &quot;Light My Fire&quot;.

The minor third may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the fifth and sixth harmonics, or from the 19th harmonic.

The minor third is commonly used to express sadness in music, and research shows that this mirrors its use in speech, as a tone similar to a minor third is produced during sad speech. It is also a quartal (based on an ascendance of one or more perfect fourths) interval, as opposed to the major third&#x27;s quintality. The minor third is also obtainable in reference to a fundamental note from the undertone series, while the major third is obtainable as such from the overtone series. (See Otonality and Utonality.)

The minor scale is so named because of the presence of this interval between its tonic and mediant (1st and 3rd) scale degrees.
Minor chords too take their name from the presence of this interval built on the chord&#x27;s root (provided that the interval of a perfect fifth from the root is also present or implied).

A minor third, in just intonation, corresponds to a pitch ratio of 6:5 or 315.64 cents. In an equal tempered tuning, a minor third is equal to three semitones, a ratio of 21/4:1 (about 1.189), or 300 cents, 15.64 cents narrower than the 6:5 ratio. In other meantone tunings it is wider, and in 19 equal temperament it is very nearly the 6:5 ratio of just intonation; in more complex schismatic temperaments, such as 53 equal temperament, the &quot;minor third&quot; is often significantly flat (being close to Pythagorean tuning ()), although the &quot;augmented second&quot; produced by such scales is often within ten cents of a pure 6:5 ratio. If a minor third is tuned in accordance with the fundamental of the overtone series, the result is a ratio of 19:16 or 297.51 cents (the nineteenth harmonic). The 12-TET minor third (300 cents) more closely approximates the nineteenth harmonic with only 2.49 cents error. M. Ergo mistakenly claimed that the nineteenth harmonic was the highest ever written, for the bass-trumpet in Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; (1848 to 1874), when Robert Schumann&#x27;s Op. 86 &quot;Konzertstück&quot; for 4 Horns and Orchestra (1849) features the twentieth harmonic (four octaves and major third above the fundamental) in the first horn part three times.

Other pitch ratios are given related names, the septimal minor third with ratio 7:6 and the tridecimal minor third with ratio 13:11 in particular.

The minor third is classed as an imperfect consonance and is considered one of the most consonant intervals after the unison, octave, perfect fifth, and perfect fourth.

The sopranino saxophone and E♭ clarinet sound in the concert pitch ( C ) a minor third higher than the written pitch; therefore, to get the sounding pitch one must transpose the written pitch up a minor third. Instruments in A – most commonly the A clarinet, sound a minor third lower than the written pitch.

==Pythagorean minor third==
In music theory, a &quot;semiditone&quot; (or &quot;Pythagorean minor third&quot;) is the interval 32:27 (approximately 294.13 cents). It is the minor third in Pythagorean tuning. The 32:27 Pythagorean minor third arises in the 5-limit justly tuned major scale between the 2nd and 4th degrees (in the C major scale, between D and F). 

It can be thought of as two octaves minus three justly tuned fifths. It is narrower than a justly tuned minor third by a syntonic comma. Its inversion is a Pythagorean major sixth.

<text>Harry Michael Cohen (born 10 December 1949) is a British Labour Party politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Leyton from 1983 to 1997 and Leyton and Wanstead from 1997 to 2010.

==Early life==
Cohen left the George Gascoigne Secondary Modern school (closed in 1966) on Queens Road in Walthamstow at 15, and trained as a public service accountant at the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, as well as studying part-time at East Ham Technical College (now Newham College of Further Education). He later gained MSc in Politics and Administration from Birkbeck College, University of London in 1995. He became an accountant and auditor for the boroughs of Waltham Forest, Hackney and Haringey, then later for the union NALGO (became part of UNISON in 1993).

He was elected as a local councillor in Waltham Forest at the age of 22, and served for 11 years before becoming an MP.

==Parliamentary career==
Cohen was first elected to the House of Commons at the 1983 general election as MP for Leyton, transferring to the new Leyton and Wanstead constituency after boundary changes for the 1997 general election.

He was a member of the House of Commons Defence Select Committee between 1997 and 2001, and has been a member of the Work and Pensions Select Committee since 2005.

On 31 October 2006, Cohen was one of 12 Labour MPs to back Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party&#x27;s call for an inquiry into the Iraq War.

Cohen was Chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Tibet and Secretary of the All-Party Parliamentary Race and Community Group and was a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, a signatory to Jews for Justice for Palestinians, and counts Karl Marx, Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and the Dalai Lama as political influences.

===Expenses===

It was revealed in March 2009 that Cohen had received £104,701 over the previous five years under the Additional Costs Allowance for his Wanstead home based upon the representation that this was his second home. The home that Cohen represented as his primary home was a house in Colchester, despite the fact that Cohen spent very little time at that location and used it only as a holiday home. As his Wanstead home is where Cohen resides both when going to Westminster and attending to his constituency, the claim of the Additional Costs Allowance was criticised as an abuse of an expense allowance intended to help Members of Parliament who need to maintain one home in their constituency and another in London. Cohen responded to criticism by stating that the Additional Costs Allowance was intended to be de facto salary for Members of Parliament.

On 30 June 2009 he announced he would not stand for re-election. He said the strain caused by the criticism over his expenses, and the formal investigation into his claims, were the main factors behind his departure.

On 22 January 2010 the Standards and Privileges Committee of the House of Commons published its report into Cohen&#x27;s expenses and concluded that he had received over £60,000 in expenses to which he was not entitled. The report did recognise that the ill-health of Cohen&#x27;s wife (she suffered a stroke in 2004) had been a significant factor in the decisions he had made but maintained that he had still committed a serious breach of the rules. The report recommended that Cohen apologise to the House, which he did on 29 January 2010, and that the Resettlement Grant of £65,000, normally paid to Members of Parliament upon retirement, be withheld. The House ratified the latter punishment on 1 February 2010.

<text>In music from Western culture, a seventh is a musical interval encompassing seven staff positions (see Interval number for more details), and the major seventh is one of two commonly occurring sevenths. It is qualified as &quot;major&quot; because it is the larger of the two. The major seventh spans eleven semitones, its smaller counterpart being the minor seventh, spanning ten semitones. For example, the interval from C to B is a major seventh, as the note B lies eleven semitones above C, and there are seven staff positions from C to B. Diminished and augmented sevenths span the same number of staff positions, but consist of a different number of semitones (nine and twelve).

The easiest way to locate and identify the major seventh is from the octave rather than the unison, and it is suggested that one sings the octave first. For example, the most commonly cited example of a melody featuring a major seventh is the tonic-octave-major seventh of the opening to &quot;(Somewhere) Over the Rainbow&quot;. &quot;Not many songwriters begin a melody with a major seventh interval; perhaps that&#x27;s why there are few memorable examples.&quot; However, two songs provide exceptions to this generalisation: Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;I love you&quot; (1944) opens with a descending major seventh and Jesse Harris&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Know Why&quot;,(made famous by Norah Jones in her 2002 debut album, &quot;Come Away with Me&quot;), starts with an ascending one. In the refrain of &quot;Bali Hai&quot; in &quot;South Pacific,&quot; the third tone (&quot;Hai&quot;) is a major seventh to the first (&quot;Ba-&quot;).

The major seventh occurs most commonly built on the root of major triads, resulting in the chord type also known as major seventh chord or major-major seventh chord: including I7 and IV7 in major. &quot;Major seven chords add jazziness to a musical passage. Alone, a major seventh interval can sound ugly.&quot;

A major seventh in just intonation most often corresponds to a pitch ratio of 15:8 (); in 12-tone equal temperament, a major seventh is equal to eleven semitones, or 1100 cents, about 12 cents wider than the 15:8 major seventh. In 24-tone equal temperament a supermajor seventh, semiaugmented seventh or, semidiminished octave, 23 quarter-tones, is 1150 cents (). The small major seventh is a ratio of 9:5, now identified as a just minor seventh. 35:18, or 1151.23 cents, is the ratio of the septimal semi-diminished octave. The 15:8 just major seventh occurs arises in the extended C major scale between C &amp; B and F &amp; E. 

The major seventh interval is considered one of the most dissonant intervals after its inversion the minor second. For this reason, its melodic use is infrequent in classical music. However, in the genial Gavotte from J.S. Bach’s Partita in E major for solo violin, a major seventh features both as a chord (bar 1) and as a melodic interval (bar 5): Another piece that makes more dramatic use of the major seventh is &quot;The Hut on Fowl&#x27;s Legs&quot; from Mussorgsky&#x27;s piano suite &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; (1874). 
Another is the closing duet from Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot;, &quot;O terra addio&quot;. During the early 20th century, the major seventh was used increasingly both as a melodic and a harmonic interval, particularly by composers of the Second Viennese School. Anton Webern&#x27;s Variations for Piano, Op. 27, opens with a major seventh and the interval recurs frequently throughout the piece.
Under equal temperament this interval is enharmonically equivalent to a diminished octave (which has a similar musical use to the augmented unison).

The major seventh chord is however very common in jazz, especially &#x27;cool&#x27; jazz, and has a characteristically soft and sweet sound: think of the first chord in &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot;. The major seventh chord consists of the first, third, fifth and seventh degrees (notes) of the major scale. In the key of C, it comprises the notes C E G and B.

<text>In music theory, a minor seventh is one of two musical intervals that span seven staff positions. It is &quot;minor&quot; because it is the smaller of the two sevenths, spanning ten semitones. The major seventh spans eleven. For example, the interval from A to G is a minor seventh, as the note G lies ten semitones above A, and there are seven staff positions from A to G. Diminished and augmented sevenths span the same number of staff positions, but consist of a different number of semitones (nine and twelve, respectively).

== Use ==
Minor seventh intervals rarely feature in melodies (and especially in their openings) but occur more often than major sevenths. A well-known example, in part due to its frequent use in theory classes, is found between the first two words of the phrase &quot;There&#x27;s a place for us&quot; in the song &quot;Somewhere&quot; in &quot;West Side Story&quot;. Another well-known example occurs between the first two notes of the introduction to the main theme music from &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; theme.

The most common occurrence of the minor seventh is built on the root of the prevailing key&#x27;s dominant triad, producing the all-important dominant seventh chord.

During the &quot;common practice period&quot; the minor seventh was prescribed as a dissonance, requiring resolution to a consonance.

==In other temperaments==
In just intonation there is both a 16:9 &quot;&quot;lesser&quot; just minor seventh&quot;, also called the &quot;Pythagorean small minor seventh&quot;,() equivalent to two perfect fourths stacked on top of each other, and 9:5, called the &quot;&quot;greater&quot; just minor seventh&quot; () equivalent to a perfect fifth and a minor third on top of each other. An interval close in frequency is the harmonic seventh. ()

<text>In music theory, a sixth is a musical interval encompassing six note letter names or staff positions (see Interval number for more details), and the major sixth is one of two commonly occurring sixths. It is qualified as &quot;major&quot; because it is the larger of the two. The major sixth spans nine semitones. Its smaller counterpart, the minor sixth, spans eight semitones. For example, the interval from C up to the nearest A is a major sixth. It is a sixth because it encompasses six note letter names (C, D, E, F, G, A) and six staff positions. It is a major sixth, not a minor sixth, because the note A lies nine semitones above C. Diminished and augmented sixths (such as C to A and C to A) span the same number of note letter names and staff positions, but consist of a different number of semitones (seven and ten, respectively).

A commonly cited example of a melody featuring the major sixth as its opening is &quot;My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean&quot;.

The major sixth is one of the consonances of common practice music, along with the unison, octave, perfect fifth, major and minor thirds, minor sixth, and (sometimes) the perfect fourth. In the common practice period, sixths were considered interesting and dynamic consonances along with their inverses the thirds. In medieval times theorists always described them as Pythagorean major sixths of 27/16 and therefore considered them dissonances unusable in a stable final sonority. How major sixths actually were sung in the Middle Ages is unknown. In just intonation, the (5/3) major sixth is classed as a consonance of the 5-limit.

A major sixth is also used in transposing music to E-flat instruments, like the alto clarinet, alto saxophone, E-flat tuba, trumpet, natural horn, and alto horn when in E-flat, as a written C sounds like E-flat on those instruments.

Assuming close-position voicings for the following examples, the major sixth occurs in a first inversion minor triad, a second inversion major triad, and either inversion of a diminished triad. It also occurs in the second and third inversions of a dominant seventh chord.

The septimal major sixth (12/7) is approximated in 53 tone equal temperament by an interval of 41 steps or 928 cents.

== Frequency proportions ==

Many intervals in a various tuning systems qualify to be called &quot;major sixth&quot;, sometimes with additional qualifying words in the names. The following examples are sorted by increasing width.

In just intonation, the most common major sixth is the pitch ratio of 5:3 (), approximately 884 cents.

In 12-tone equal temperament, a major sixth is equal to nine semitones, exactly 900 cents, with a frequency ratio of the (9/12) root of 2 over 1.

Another major sixth is the Pythagorean major sixth with a ratio of 27:16, approximately 906 cents, called &quot;Pythagorean&quot; because it can be constructed from three just perfect fifths (C-A = C-G-D-A = 702+702+702-1200=906). It is the inversion of the Pythagorean minor third, and corresponds to the interval between the 27th and the 16th harmonics. The 27:16 Pythagorean major sixth arises in the C Pythagorean major scale between F and D, as well as between C and A, G and E, and D and B. In the 5-limit justly tuned major scale, it occurs between the 4th and 2nd degrees (in C major, between F and D).
Another major sixth is the 12:7 septimal major sixth or supermajor sixth, the inversion of the septimal minor third, of approximately 933 cents. The septimal major sixth (12/7) is approximated in 53-tone equal temperament by an interval of 41 steps, giving an actual frequency ratio of the (41/53) root of 2 over 1, approximately 928 cents.

The nineteenth subharmonic is a major sixth, A = 32/19 = 902.49 cents.
