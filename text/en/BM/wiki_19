<text>In the early Latter Day Saint movement, the School of the Prophets (School, also called the &quot;school of the elders&quot; or &quot;school for the Prophets&quot;) was a select group of early leaders who began meeting on January 23, 1833 in Kirtland, Ohio under the direction of Joseph Smith for both theological and secular learning.

The school was opened with a 2-day ritual, which included the first recorded version of the controversial Second Anointing, the highest ordinance in the Latter-day Saint movement. In the ceremony, a towel-clad Joseph Smith washed the feet of all 12 men present, including Sidney Rigdon, Newel K. Whitney, Joseph Smith Sr. and Hyrum Smith. Joseph taught that after the ceremony they had all been &quot;sealed up unto heaven.&quot;

==Etymology==
The phrase &quot;the School of the Prophets&quot; has been identified as the &quot;naioth&quot; or &quot;dwellings&quot; in Ramah in 1 Samuel 19: where the fellowship or &quot;school of the prophets&quot; assembled to worship, pray, and ask God for wisdom. It was also applied to Harvard University in 1655 when the Reverend Thomas Shepard asked the United Colonies Commissioners to find &quot;some way of comfortable maintenance for that School of the Prophets that now is&quot; and suggested that each family in New England give one-quarter bushel of wheat to the college. It was more commonly applied in the 18th century to Yale University, and it was the title of a history of Yale from 1701 to 1740 by Richard Warch.

Historian Joseph F. Darowski has called attention to earlier Old Testament and Protestant precedents, stating that Harvard and Yale were both once commonly called schools of the prophets.

== History ==

=== Creation ===
A revelation in the Doctrine and Covenants (D&amp;C) begins by commanding that a house be prepared for the Presidency of the School of the Prophets. (D&amp;C 88:127-141) The School is to instruct all the officers of the church in all things expedient. This revelation goes on to describe how the meetings of the School are to begin—including a special salutation and the washing of the feet of all its members. Another D&amp;C revelation (Section 90) reveals that the &quot;keys&quot; of the School have been given to the church presidency &quot;That thereby they [the church] may be perfected in their ministry for the salvation of Zion, and of the nations of Israel, and of the Gentiles, as many as will believe. That through your administration they may receive the word, and through their administration, the word may go forth unto the ends of the earth, unto the Gentiles first, and then, behold, and lo, they shall turn unto the Jews. And then cometh the day when the arm of the Lord shall be revealed in power in convincing the nations, the heathen nations, the house of Joseph, of the gospel of their salvation.&quot;

The first meeting of the School was held on January 24, 1833, at the home-based store owned by Newel K. Whitney in Kirtland, Ohio. The school provided a setting for spiritual experiences and in-depth discussions of gospel principles, as preparation for those who would preach as missionaries. One such experience was the revelation now known as the Word of Wisdom. In April 1833 the school was disbanded as missionaries embarked.

=== Other early schools ===
In summer 1833, another branch of this school was created under the direction of Parley P. Pratt in Independence, Missouri, called the School in Zion. This school was praised in revelation (D&amp;C 97:3), and met weekly with about 60 students in an outdoor setting. After the Mormons were expelled from Independence, the school was reconstituted in Kirtland in November 1834-35, as the School of the Elders. A series of seven lectures presented at the school were published as part of the Doctrine and Covenants in 1835 and later came to be known as the &quot;Lectures on Faith.&quot; In 1836, the school was again called the School of the Prophets. Though the School went into recess, it is apparent Joseph Smith planned to revive it after the completion of the Kirtland Temple.

=== The Utah period ===
Following the 1844 succession crisis which ensued after Smith&#x27;s death, Brigham Young led those who followed him in what is now the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) to Utah, where Young began several schools of the prophets during his tenure as church president, beginning in 1867 in Salt Lake City. Initially, it was a forum to discuss church issues among its leaders and selected priesthood holders, under the auspices of the University of Deseret. Later, branches were opened in the larger LDS Church communities under the direction of local priesthood leaders, with discussion expanding into religion, economics, and civic matters. Branches opened in Provo, Logan, Brigham City, Spanish Fork, Nephi, Ephraim, American Fork, and Ogden.

These confidential, invitation-only classes were closed in 1872 before a reorganized School of the Prophets was created in Salt Lake City for general authorities and other church leaders. This school worked toward creating economic cooperatives in the church, and when the United Order was incorporated in 1874, the school was dissolved.

Young&#x27;s successor, John Taylor, also organized schools of the prophets in Salt Lake City and St. George in 1883, following the model of the original school in Missouri, but these were short-lived and probably dissolved in early 1884.

<text>A sari (sometimes also saree or sadi) is a drape (cloth) and a women&#x27;s garment in the Indian subcontinent. It consists of an un-stitched stretch of woven fabric arranged over the body as a dress, with one end attached to the waist, while the other end rests over one shoulder as a stole, sometimes baring a part of the midriff. It may vary from in length, and in breadth, and is a form of ethnic wear in Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Pakistan. There are various names and styles of sari manufacture and draping, the most common being the Nivi style. The sari is worn with a fitted bodice also called a choli ( or in southern India, and in Nepal) and a petticoat called , , or . It remains fashionable in the Indian subcontinent today.

== Etymology ==
The Hindi word (), described in Sanskrit which means &#x27;strip of cloth&#x27; and or in Pali, ಸೀರೆ or &quot;sīre&quot; in Kannada and which evolved to in modern Indian languages. The word is mentioned as describing women&#x27;s dharmic attire in Sanskrit literature and Buddhist literature called Jatakas. This could be equivalent to the modern day sari. The term for female bodice, the evolved from ancient . &quot;Rajatarangini&quot;, a tenth-century literary work by Kalhana, states that the choli from the Deccan was introduced under the royal order in Kashmir.

The petticoat is called () in Hindi, () in Marathi, () in Tamil ( in other parts of South India: , , ), () in Bengali and eastern India, and () in Sinhalese. Apart from the standard &quot;petticoat&quot;, it may also be called &quot;inner skirt&quot; or an inskirt.

==Origins and history==
The history of sari-like drapery can be traced back to the Indus Valley Civilisation, which flourished during 2800–1800 BCE around the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. Cotton was first cultivated and woven on the Indian subcontinent around the 5th millennium BCE. Dyes used during this period are still in use, particularly indigo, lac, red madder and turmeric. Silk was woven around 2450 BCE and 2000 BCE.

The word &quot;sari&quot; evolved from () is mentioned in early Hindu literature as women&#x27;s attire. The sari or evolved from a three-piece ensemble comprising the , the lower garment; the ; a veil worn over the shoulder or the head; and the , a chestband. This ensemble is mentioned in Sanskrit literature and Buddhist Pali literature during the 6th century BCE.

Ancient antariya closely resembled the &quot;dhoti&quot; wrap in the &quot;fishtail&quot; version which was passed through the legs, covered the legs loosely and then flowed into long, decorative pleats at front of the legs. It further evolved into &quot;Bhairnivasani&quot; skirt, today known as &quot;ghagri&quot; and &quot;lehenga&quot;. Uttariya was a shawl-like veil worn over the shoulder or head. It evolved into what is known today known as dupatta and ghoonghat. Likewise, the evolved into the &quot;choli&quot; by the 1st century CE.

The ancient Sanskrit work &quot;Kadambari&quot; by Banabhatta and ancient Tamil poetry, such as the &quot;Silappadhikaram&quot;, describes women in exquisite drapery or sari. In ancient India, although women wore saris that bared the midriff, the Dharmasastra writers stated that women should be dressed such that the navel would never become visible, which may have led to a taboo on navel exposure at some times and places.

It is generally accepted that wrapped sari-like garments for lower body and sometimes shawls or scarf like garment called &#x27;uttariya&#x27; for upper body, have been worn by Indian women for a long time, and that they have been worn in their current form for hundreds of years. In ancient couture the lower garment was called &#x27;nivi&#x27; or &#x27;nivi bandha&#x27;, while the upper body was mostly left bare. The works of Kalidasa mention the , a form of tight fitting breast band that simply covered the breasts. It was also sometimes referred to as an or .

Poetic references from works like Silappadikaram indicate that during the Sangam period in ancient Tamil Nadu in southern India, a single piece of clothing served as both lower garment and head covering, leaving the midriff completely uncovered. Similar styles of the sari are recorded paintings by Raja Ravi Varma in Kerala. Numerous sources say that everyday costume in ancient India until recent times in Kerala consisted of a pleated dhoti or (sarong) wrap, combined with a breast band called or and occasionally a wrap called that could at times be used to cover the upper body or head. The two-piece Kerala mundum neryathum (mundu, a dhoti or sarong, neryath, a shawl, in Malayalam) is a survival of ancient clothing styles. The one-piece sari in Kerala is derived from neighbouring Tamil Nadu or Deccan during medieval period based on its appearance on various temple murals in medieval Kerala.

Early Sanskrit literature has a wide vocabulary of terms for the veiling used by women, such as &quot;Avagunthana&quot; (oguntheti/oguṇthikā), meaning cloak-veil, &quot;Uttariya&quot; meaning shoulder-veil, &quot;Mukha-pata&quot; meaning face-veil and &quot;Sirovas-tra&quot; meaning head-veil.

In the &quot;Pratimānātaka&quot;, a play by Bhāsa describes in context of &quot;Avagunthana&quot; veil that &quot;ladies may be seen without any blame (for the parties concerned) in a religious session, in marriage festivities, during a calamity and in a forest&quot;. The same sentiment is more generically expressed in later Sanskrit literature. Śūdraka, the author of Mṛcchakatika set in fifth century BCE says that the &quot;Avagaunthaha&quot; was not used by women everyday and at every time. He says that a married lady was expected to put on a veil while moving in the public. This may indicate that it was not necessary for unmarried females to put on a veil. This form of veiling by married women is still prevalent in Hindi-speaking areas, and is known as &quot;ghoonghat&quot; where the loose end of a sari is pulled over the head to act as a facial veil.

Based on sculptures and paintings, tight bodices or &quot;cholis&quot; are believed to have evolved between the 2nd century BCE to 6th century CE in various regional styles. Early &quot;cholis&quot; were front covering tied at the back; this style was more common in parts of ancient northern India. This ancient form of bodice or choli is still common in the state of Rajasthan today. Various styles of decorative traditional embroidery like gota patti, mochi, pakko, kharak, suf, kathi, phulkari and gamthi are done on &quot;cholis&quot;. In Southern parts of India, choli is known as &quot;ravikie&quot; which is tied at the front instead of back, kasuti is traditional form of embroidery used for cholis in this region. In Nepal, choli is known as &quot;cholo&quot; or &quot;chaubandi cholo&quot; and is traditionally tied at the front.

Red is the most favoured colour for wedding saris, which are the traditional garment choice for brides in Hindu wedding. Women traditionally wore various types of regional handloom saris made of silk, cotton, ikkat, block-print, embroidery and tie-dye textiles. Most sought after brocade silk saris are Banasari, Kanchipuram (Sometimes also Kanchipuram or Kanjivaram), Gadwal, Paithani, Mysore, Uppada, Bagalpuri, Balchuri, Maheshwari, Chanderi, Mekhela, Ghicha, Narayan pet and Eri etc. are traditionally worn for festive and formal occasions.

 Silk Ikat and cotton saris known as Patola, Pochampally, Bomkai, Khandua, Sambalpuri, Gadwal, Berhampuri, Bargarh, Jamdani, Tant, Mangalagiri, Guntur, Narayan pet, Chanderi, Maheshwari, Nuapatn, Tussar, Ilkal, Kotpad and Manipuri were worn for both festive and everyday attire. Tie-dyed and block-print saris known as Bandhani, Leheria/Leheriya, Bagru, Ajrakh, Sungudi, Kota Dabu/Dabu print, Bagh and Kalamkari were traditionally worn during monsoon season.

Gota Patti is popular form of traditional embroidery used on saris for formal occasions, various other types of traditional folk embroidery such mochi, pakko, kharak, suf, kathi, phulkari and gamthi are also commonly used for both informal and formal occasion. Today, modern fabrics like polyester, georgette and charmeuse are also commonly used.

==Styles of draping==

There are more than 80 recorded ways to wear a sari. The most common style is for the sari to be wrapped around the waist, with the loose end of the drape to be worn over the shoulder, baring the midriff. However, the sari can be draped in several different styles, though some styles do require a sari of a particular length or form. Ṛta Kapur Chishti, a sari historian and recognised textile scholar, has documented 108 ways of wearing a sari in her book, &#x27;Saris: Tradition and Beyond&#x27;. The book documents the sari drapes across fourteen states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh. The Sari Series, a non-profit project created in 2017 is a digital anthology documenting India&#x27;s regional sari drapes providing over 80 short films on how-to-drape the various styles.

The French cultural anthropologist and sari researcher Chantal Boulanger categorised sari drapes into the following families:

* Nivi sari – style originally worn in Deccan region; besides the modern nivi, there is also the &quot;Nauvari&quot;, &quot;kaccha&quot; or &quot;kasta nivi&quot;, where the pleats are passed through the legs and tucked into at the back. This allows free movement while covering the legs.
* Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarati, Rajasthani – It is worn similar to nivi style but with loose end of sari &quot;aanchal&quot; or &quot;pallu&quot; placed in the front, therefore this style is known as &quot;sidha anchal&quot; or &quot;sidha pallu or sojha paala.&quot; After tucking in the pleats similar to the nivi style, the loose end is taken from the back, draped across the right shoulder, and pulled across to be secured in the back. This style is also worn by Punjabi Hindus and Sindhi Hindus. 
* Bengali and Odia style is worn with single box-pleat. Traditionally the Bengali style is worn with single box pleat where the sari is wrapped around in an anti-clockwise direction around the waist and then a second time from the other direction. The loose end is a lot longer and that goes around the body over the left shoulder. There is enough cloth left to cover the head as well. The Brahmika sari was introduced to Bengal by Jnanadanandini Devi after her tour in Bombay in 1870. Jnanadanandini improvised upon the sari style worn by Parsi and Gujarati women, which came to be known as Brahmika style.
* Himalayan – Kulluvi Pattu is traditional form of woolen sari worn in Himachal Pradesh, similar variation is also worn in Uttarakhand.
* Nepali: Nepal has many different varieties of draping sari, today the most common is the Nivi drape. The traditional Newari sari drape is, folding the sari till it is below knee length and then wearing it like a nivi sari but the pallu is not worn across the chest and instead is tied around the waist and leaving it so it drops from waist to the knee, instead the pallu or a shawl is tied across the chest, by wrapping it from the right hip and back and is thrown over the shoulders. Saris are worn with blouse that are thicker and are tied several times across the front. The Bhojpuri, Maithil and Awadhi speaking community wears the sari sojha palla like the Gujarati drape. The women of the Rajbanshi communities traditionally wear their sari with no choli and tied below the neck like a towel but today only old women wear it in that style and the nivi and the Bengali drapes are more popular today. The Nivi drape was popularized in Nepal by the Shah royals and the Ranas.
* Nauvari and Kasta: this drape is worn similar to ancient form of navi sari worn in &quot;Kacche&quot; style where pleats in the front are tucked in the back, though there are many regional and societal variations. The style worn by Brahmin women differs from that of the Marathas. The style also differs from community to community. This style is popular in Maharashtra and Goa. 
* Madisar – this drape is typical of Iyengar/Iyer Brahmin ladies from Tamil Nadu. Traditional Madisar is worn using 9 yards sari. 
* The Parsi &#x27;gara&#x27; is worn by Zoroastrian women in Gujarat in India and Sindh in Pakistan, it is worn similar to &quot;sidha pallu&quot;, it unique compared to traditional sari due to its Chinese style embroidery. 
* Pin Kosuvam – this is the traditional Tamil Nadu style
* Kodagu style – this drape is confined to ladies hailing from the Kodagu district of Karnataka. In this style, the pleats are created in the rear, instead of the front. The loose end of the sari is draped back-to-front over the right shoulder, and is pinned to the rest of the sari.
* &quot;Gobbe Seere&quot; – This style is worn by women in the Malnad or Sahyadri and central region of Karnataka. It is worn with 18 molas sari with three-four rounds at the waist and a knot after crisscrossing over shoulders.
* Karnataka – In Karnataka, apart from traditional Nivi sari, sari is also worn in &quot;Karnataka Kacche&quot; drape, kacche drape which shows nivi drape in front and kacche in back, there are Four kacche styles known in Karnataka – &quot;&quot;Hora kacche&quot;, &quot;Melgacche&quot; ,&quot;Vala kacche&quot; or &quot;Olagacche&quot; and &quot; Hale Kacche&quot;&quot;.
* Kerala sari style – the two-piece sari, or Mundum Neryathum, worn in Kerala. Usually made of unbleached cotton and decorated with gold or coloured stripes and/or borders. Also the Kerala sari, a sort of mundum neryathum.
* Kunbi style or &quot;denthli&quot;: Goan Kunbis and Gauda, and those of them who have migrated to other states use this way of draping sari or &quot;kappad&quot;, this form of draping is created by tying a knot in the fabric below the shoulder and a strip of cloth which crossed the left shoulder was fasten on the back.
* Riha-Mekhela, Kokalmora, Chador/Murot Mora Gamusa – This style worn in Assam is a wrap around style cloth similar to other Southeast Asian garments. it is originally a four-set of separate garments known &quot;Riha-Mekhela&quot;, &quot;Kokalmora&quot;, &quot;Chador&quot; or &quot;Murot Mora Gamusa&quot;. The bottom portion, draped from the waist downwards is called &quot;Mekhela&quot;. The &quot;Riha&quot; or &quot;Methoni&quot; is wrapped and often secured by tying them firmly across the chest, covering the breasts originally but now it is sometimes replaced by blouse from mainland India. The &quot;Kokalmora&quot; was used originally to tie the &quot;Mekhela&quot; around the waist and keep it firm. 
* &quot;Innaphi&quot; and &quot;Phanek&quot; – This style of clothing worn in Manipur is also worn with three-set garment known as &quot;Innaphi&quot; Viel, &quot;Phanek&quot; lower wrap and long sleeved &quot;choli&quot;. It is somewhat similar to the style of clothing worn in Assam.
* Jainsem – It is a Khasi style of clothing worn in Khasi which is made up of several pieces of cloth, giving the body a cylindrical shape.

=== Historic photographs and regional styles ===
===Nivi style===

The Nivi is the most common style of sari worn today. It originated in the Deccan region. In the Deccan region, the Nivi existed in two styles, a style similar to modern Nivi and the second style worn with front pleats of Nivi tucked in the back.

The increased interactions during colonial era saw most women from royal families come out of purdah in the 1900s. This necessitated a change of dress. Maharani Indira Devi of Cooch Behar popularised the chiffon sari. She was widowed early in life and followed the convention of abandoning her richly woven Baroda shalus in favour of the unadorned mourning white as per tradition. Characteristically, she transformed her &quot;mourning&quot; clothes into high fashion. She had saris woven in France to her personal specifications, in white chiffon, and introduced the silk chiffon sari to the royal fashion repertoire.

Under colonial rule, the petticoat was adopted, along with Victorian styles of puffed-sleeved blouses, which was commonly seen among the elites in Bombay presidency and Bengal presidency. Nivi drape starts with one end of the sari tucked into the waistband of the petticoat, usually a plain skirt. The cloth is wrapped around the lower body once, then hand-gathered into even pleats below the navel. The pleats are tucked into the waistband of the petticoat. They create a graceful, decorative effect which poets have likened to the petals of a flower. After one more turn around the waist, the loose end is draped over the shoulder. The loose end is called the &quot;aanchal&quot;, &quot;pallu&quot;, &quot;pallav&quot;, &quot;seragu&quot;, or &quot;paita&quot; depending on the language. It is draped diagonally in front of the torso. It is worn across the right hip to over the left shoulder, partly baring the midriff. The navel can be revealed or concealed by the wearer by adjusting the &quot;pallu&quot;, depending on the social setting. The long end of the &quot;pallu&quot; hanging from the back of the shoulder is often intricately decorated. The &quot;pallu&quot; may be hanging freely, tucked in at the waist, used to cover the head, or used to cover the neck, by draping it across the right shoulder as well. Some Nivi styles are worn with the &quot;pallu&quot; draped from the back towards the front, coming from the back over the right shoulder with one corner tucked by the left hip, covering the torso/waist. The Nivi sari was popularised through the paintings of Raja Ravi Varma. In one of his paintings, the Indian subcontinent was shown as a mother wearing a flowing Nivi sari. The ornaments sometimes worn in the midriff region on top of a sari are waist chains. They are sometimes worn as a part of bridal jewellery.

==Professional style of draping==

Because of the harsh extremes in temperature on the Indian subcontinent, the sari fills a practical role as well as a decorative one. It is not only warming in winter and cooling in summer, but its loose-fitting tailoring is preferred by women who must be free to move as their duties require. For this reason, it is the uniform of Biman Bangladesh Airlines and Air India uniform for air hostesses. An air hostess-style sari is draped in similar manner to a traditional sari, but most of the pleats are pinned to keep them in place. Bangladeshi female newsreaders and anchors also drape their sari in this particular style.

Saris are worn as uniforms by the female hotel staff of many five-star luxury hotels in India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh as the symbol of Indian, Sri Lankan, and Bangladeshi culture, respectively. 
Similarly, the female politicians of all three countries wear the sari in a professional manner. Bangladeshi politicians usually wear saris with long sleeve blouse while covering their midriff. Some politicians pair up saris with hijabs or shawls for more coverage.

The women of the Nehru–Gandhi family like Indira Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi have worn a special blouse for the campaign trail which is longer than usual and is tucked in to prevent any midriff showing while waving to the crowds. Stylist Prasad Bidapa has to say, &quot;I think Sonia Gandhi is the country&#x27;s most stylish politician. But that&#x27;s because she&#x27;s inherited the best collection of saris from her mother-in-law. I&#x27;m also happy that she supports the Indian handloom industry with her selection.&quot;

Most female MPs in the Sri Lankan Parliament wear a Kandyan osari. This includes prominent women in politics, the first female premier in the world, Sirimavo Bandaranaike and President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. Contemporary examples include Pavithra Wanniarachchi, the sitting health minister in Cabinet. The adoption of the sari is not exclusive to Sinhalese politicians; Muslim MP Ferial Ashraff combined a hijab with her sari while in Parliament.

==Bangladesh==

Sari is the national attire for women in Bangladesh, Although Dhakai Jamdani (hand made sari) is worldwide known and most famous to all women who wear sari but there are also many variety of saris in Bangladesh. There are many regional variations of them in both silk and cotton.

There are many regional variations of saris in both silk and cotton. e.g., Dhakai Banarasi sari, Rajshahi silk, Tangail sari, Tant sari, Tassar silk sari, Manipuri sari and Katan sari.

The sari is reserved as the dress of choice for important occasions and events. 
In 2013, the traditional art of weaving jamdani was declared a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
In 2016, Bangladesh received geographical indication (GI) status for Jamdani sari.

==Sri Lanka==

Sri Lankan women wear saris in many styles. Two ways of draping the sari are popular and tend to dominate: the Indian style (classic nivi drape) and the Kandyan style (or in Sinhala). The Kandyan style is generally more popular in the hill country region of Kandy from which the style gets its name. Though local preferences play a role, most women decide on style depending on personal preference or what is perceived to be most flattering for their figure.

The traditional Kandyan (Osariya) style consists of a full blouse which covers the midriff completely and is partially tucked in at the front. However, the modern intermingling of styles has led to most wearers baring the midriff. The final tail of the sari is neatly pleated rather than free-flowing. This is rather similar to the pleated rosette used in the &quot;Pin Kosuvam&quot; style noted earlier in the article.

The Kandyan style is considered the national dress of Sinhalese women. It is the uniform of the air hostesses of SriLankan Airlines.

During the 1960s, the mini sari known as &#x27;hipster&#x27; sari created a wrinkle in Sri Lankan fashion, since it was worn below the navel and barely above the line of prosecution for indecent exposure. The conservative people described the &#x27;hipster&#x27; as &quot;&quot;an absolute travesty of a beautiful costume almost a desecration&quot; and &quot;a hideous and purposeless garment&quot;&quot;.

==Nepal==

The sari is the most commonly worn women&#x27;s clothing in Nepal where a special style of sari draping is called &quot;haku patasihh&quot;. The sari is draped around the waist and a shawl is worn covering the upper half of the sari, which is used in place of a &quot;pallu&quot;.

==Pakistan==

In Pakistan, the saris are still popular and worn on special occasions. The Shalwar kameez, however, is worn throughout the country on a daily basis. The sari nevertheless remains a popular garment among the middle and upper class for many formal functions. Saris can be seen worn commonly in metropolitan cities such as Karachi and Islamabad and are worn regularly for weddings and other business types of functions. Saris are also worn by many Muslim women in Sindh to show their status or to enhance their beauty. Phulkari, Kota doria, banarasi, Ajrak are the most worn.
 The sari is worn as daily wear by Pakistani Hindus, by elderly Muslim women who were used to wearing it in pre-partition India and by some of the new generation who have reintroduced the interest in saris.

Black Sari Day, is a celebration of Iqbal Bano a woman who fought in a Black sari in Lahore against Zia. She sang Hum Dekhenge. Although this event is to bring family closer and to enjoy the day of Iqbal Bano.

==Similarities with other Asian clothing==
While the sari is typical traditional wear for women in the Indian subcontinent, clothing worn by women in Southeast Asian countries like Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Cambodia, Thailand and Laos resemble it, where a long rectangular piece of cloth is draped around the body. These are different from the sari as they are wrapped around the lower-half of body as a skirt, worn with a shirt/blouse and resemble a sarong, as seen in the Burmese (; ), Filipino and , Laotian (; ), Laotian and Thai (; ) and (, ; , , ), Cambodian () and &quot;sampot&quot; (, , ) and Timorese . Saris, worn predominantly in the Indian subcontinent are usually draped with one end of the cloth fastened around the waist, and the other end placed over the shoulder baring the midriff.

==Ornamentation and decorative accessories==

Saris are woven with one plain end (the end that is concealed inside the wrap), two long decorative borders running the length of the sari, and a one to three-foot section at the other end which continues and elaborates the length-wise decoration. This end is called the &quot;pallu&quot;; it is the part thrown over the shoulder in the nivi style of draping.

In past times, saris were woven of silk or cotton. The rich could afford finely woven, diaphanous silk saris that, according to folklore, could be passed through a finger ring. The poor wore coarsely woven cotton saris. All saris were handwoven and represented a considerable investment of time or money.

Simple hand-woven villagers&#x27; saris are often decorated with checks or stripes woven into the cloth. Inexpensive saris were also decorated with block printing using carved wooden blocks and vegetable dyes, or tie-dyeing, known in India as &quot;bhandani&quot; work.

More expensive saris had elaborate geometric, floral, or figurative ornaments or brocades created on the loom, as part of the fabric. Sometimes warp and weft threads were tie-dyed and then woven, creating &quot;ikat&quot; patterns. Sometimes threads of different colours were woven into the base fabric in patterns; an ornamented border, an elaborate &quot;pallu&quot;, and often, small repeated accents in the cloth itself. These accents are called &quot;butti&quot; or &quot;bhutti&quot; (spellings vary). For fancy saris, these patterns could be woven with gold or silver thread, which is called &quot;zari&quot; work.
Sometimes the saris were further decorated, after weaving, with various sorts of embroidery. &quot;Resham&quot; work is embroidery done with coloured silk thread. &quot;Zardozi&quot; embroidery uses gold and silver thread, and sometimes pearls and precious stones. Cheap modern versions of &quot;zardozi&quot; use synthetic metallic thread and imitation stones, such as fake pearls and Swarovski crystals.

In modern times, saris are increasingly woven on mechanical looms and made of artificial fibres, such as polyester, nylon, or rayon, which do not require starching or ironing. They are printed by machine, or woven in simple patterns made with &quot;floats&quot; across the back of the sari. This can create an elaborate appearance on the front, while looking ugly on the back. The &quot;punchra&quot; work is imitated with inexpensive machine-made tassel trim. Fashion designer Shaina NC declared, &quot;I can drape a sari in 54 different styles&quot;.

Hand-woven, hand-decorated saris are naturally much more expensive than the machine imitations. While the overall market for handweaving has plummeted (leading to much distress among Indian handweavers), hand-woven saris are still popular for weddings and other grand social occasions.

==Saris outside the Indian subcontinent==
The traditional sari made an impact in the United States during the 1970s. Eugene Novack who ran the New York store, Royal Sari House commented that he had initially been selling mainly to Indian women in the New York area. However, many American business women and housewives soon became his customers, favouring styles resembling western attire such as gowns. He also said that men appeared intrigued by the fragility and the femininity it confers on the wearer. Newcomers to the sari report that it is comfortable to wear, requiring no girdles or stockings and that the flowing garb feels so feminine with unusual grace.

The sari has gained its popularity internationally because of the growth of Indian fashion trends globally. Many Bollywood celebrities, like Aishwarya Rai, have worn it at international events representing India&#x27;s cultural heritage. In 2010, Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone wanted to represent her country at an international event, wearing the national costume. On her first red carpet appearance at the Cannes International Film Festival, she stepped out on the red carpet in a Rohit Bal sari.

Many foreign celebrities have worn traditional sari attire designed by Indian fashion designers. American actress Pamela Anderson made a surprise guest appearance on Bigg Boss, the Indian version of Big Brother, dressed in a sari that was specially designed for her by Mumbai-based fashion designer Ashley Rebello. Ashley Judd donned a purple sari at the YouthAIDS Benefit Gala in November 2007 at the Ritz Carlton in Mclean, Virginia. There was an Indian flavour to the red carpet at the annual Fashion Rocks concert in New York, with designer Rocky S walking the ramp along with Jessica, Ashley, Nicole, Kimberly and Melody – the Pussycat Dolls – dressed in saris. in 2014, American singer Selena Gomez was seen in a sari for a UNICEF charity event at Nepal.

In the United States, the sari has recently become politicised with the digital-movement, &quot;Sari, Not Sorry&quot;. Tanya Rawal-Jindia, a gender studies professor at UC Riverside, initiated this anti-xenophobia fashion-campaign on Instagram.

While an international image of the modern style sari may have been popularised by airline flight attendants, each region in the Indian subcontinent has developed, over the centuries, its own unique sari style. Following are other well-known varieties, distinct on the basis of fabric, weaving style, or motif, in the Indian subcontinent.

==Handloom and textiles==
Handloom sari weaving is one of India&#x27;s cottage industries. The handloom weaving process requires several stages in order to produce the final product. Traditionally the processes of dyeing (during the yarn, fabric, or garment stage), warping, sizing, attaching the warp, weft winding and weaving were done by weavers and local specialists around weaving towns and villages.

<doc id="413472" wikidata="Q956595" url="?curid=413472" title="Idli">
<text>Idli or idly (; plural: idlis) or iddali or iddena is a type of savoury rice cake, originating from South India, popular as a breakfast food in Southern India and in Sri Lanka. The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented de-husked black lentils and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily metabolised by the body.

Idli has several variations, including rava idli, which is made from semolina. Regional variants include &quot;sanna&quot; of Konkan.

==History==
A precursor of the modern idli is mentioned in several ancient Indian works. &quot;Vaddaradhane&quot;, a 920 CE Kannada language work by Shivakotiacharya, mentions &quot;iddalige&quot;, prepared only from a black gram batter. Chavundaraya II, the author of the earliest available Kannada encyclopedia, &quot;Lokopakara&quot; (1025 CE), describes the preparation of this food by soaking black gram in buttermilk, ground to a fine paste, and mixed with the clear water of curd and spices. The Western Chalukya king and scholar Someshwara III, reigning in the area now called Karnataka, included an idli recipe in his encyclopedia, &quot;Manasollasa&quot; (1130 CE). This Sanskrit-language work describes the food as &quot;iḍḍarikā&quot;. In Karnataka, the Idli in 1235 CE is described as being &quot;light, like coins of high value&quot;, which is not suggestive of a rice base. The food prepared using this recipe is now called &quot;uddina idli&quot; in Karnataka.

The recipe mentioned in these ancient Indian works leaves out three key aspects of the modern idli recipe: the use of rice (not just black gram), the long fermentation of the mix, and the steaming for fluffiness. The references to the modern recipe appear in the Indian works only after 1250 CE. Food historian K. T. Achaya speculates that the modern idli recipe might have originated in present-day Indonesia, which has a long tradition of fermented food. According to him, the cooks employed by the Hindu kings of the Indianised kingdoms might have invented the steamed idli there, and brought the recipe back to India during 800–1200 CE. Achaya mentioned an Indonesian dish called &quot;kedli&quot;, which according to him, was like an idli. However, Janaki Lenin was unable to find any recipe for an Indonesian dish by this name. According to food historian Colleen Taylor Sen the fermentation process of idli batter is a natural process that was discovered independently in India, since nearly all cultures use fermentation in some form. 

The Gujarati work &quot;Varṇaka Samuccaya&quot; (1520 CE) mentions idli as &quot;idari&quot;, and also mentions its local adaptation, &quot;idada&quot; (a non-fermented version of dhokla).

The earliest extant Tamil work to mention idli (as &quot;itali&quot;) is &quot;Maccapuranam&quot;, dated to the 17th century. In 2015, Chennai-based Idli caterer Eniyavan started celebrating March 30 as &quot;World Idli Day&quot;.

==Preparation==
To make Idli, four parts uncooked rice (idli rice or parboiled rice) to one part whole white lentil (black gram, &quot;Vigna mungo&quot;) are soaked separately for at least four hours – overnight if more convenient. Optionally spices such as fenugreek seeds can be added at the time of soaking, for additional flavour. Once soaked, the lentils are ground to a fine paste and the rice is separately coarsely ground, then they are combined. Next, the mixture is left to ferment overnight during which its volume will more than double. After fermentation, some of the batter may be kept as a starter culture for the next batch. The finished idli batter is put into greased moulds of an idli tray or &quot;tree&quot; for steaming. The perforated molds allow the idlis to be cooked evenly. The tree holds the trays above the level of boiling water in a pot, and the pot is covered until the idlis are done (about 10–25 minutes, depending on size). A more traditional method is to use leaves instead of moulds.

===Serving===
Since plain idlis are mild in taste, a condiment is considered essential. Idlis are often served with chutneys (coconut-based), sambar and Medu vada. However, this varies greatly by region and personal taste, it is also often served with kaara chutney (onion-based) or spicy fish curries. The dry spice mixture podi is convenient while travelling. 
===Variations===
There are several regional variations of idlis made in South India and Sri Lanka. With the emigration of south Indians and Sri Lankans throughout the region and world, many variations on idli have been created in addition to the almost countless local variations. Hard-to-get ingredients and differing cooking customs have required changes in both ingredients and methods. Parboiled rice can reduce the soaking time considerably. Store-bought ground rice or cream of rice may also be used. Similarly, semolina or cream of wheat may be used for preparing rava idli (wheat idli). Dahi (yogurt) may be added to provide the sour flavour for unfermented batters. Pre-packaged mixes allow for almost instant idlis.

In addition to or instead of fenugreek, other spices may be used such as mustard seeds, chili peppers, cumin, coriander, ginger, etc. Sugar may be added to make them sweet instead of savoury. Idli may also be stuffed with a filling of potato, beans, carrot and masala. Leftover idlis can be cut-up or crushed and sautéed for a dish called idli upma. A microwave or an automatic electric steamer that is non-stick is considered to be a convenient alternative to conventional stovetop steamers. Batter preparation using a manual rocking rock grinder can be replaced by electric grinders or blenders. Many restaurants have also come up with fusion recipes of idlis such as idly manchurian, idly fry, chilly idly, stuffed idly, to name a few.

==Batter fermentation mechanism==
Fermentation of idli batter results in both leavening caused by the generation of carbon dioxide as well as an increase in acidity. This fermentation is performed by lactic acid bacteria, especially the heterofermentative strain &quot;Leuconostoc mesenteroides&quot; and the homofermentative strain &quot;Enterococcus faecalis&quot; (formerly classified as &quot;Streptococcus faecalis&quot;). Heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria such as &quot;L. mesenteroides&quot; generate both lactic acid as well as carbon dioxide whereas homofermentative lactic acid bacteria only generate lactic acid.

Both &quot;L. mesenteroides&quot; and &quot;E. faecalis&quot; are predominantly delivered to the batter by the black gram. Both strains start multiplying while the grains are soaking and continue to do so after grinding.

&quot;L. mesenteroides&quot; tolerates high concentrations of salt unlike most other bacteria. Hence the salt in the batter and the ongoing generation of lactic acid both suppress the growth of other undesirable micro-organisms.

==Idli Day==
March 30 is celebrated as World Idli Day. It was first celebrated in 2015 at Chennai.

<text>The Royal Kennel Club (KC) is the official kennel club of the United Kingdom. It is the oldest recognised kennel club in the world. Its role is to oversee various canine activities including dog shows, dog agility and working trials. It also operates the national register of pedigree dogs in the United Kingdom and acts as a lobby group on issues involving dogs in the UK. To celebrate its 150th anniversary on 5 April 2023, King Charles III confirmed the club with a &#x27;royal&#x27; prefix.

The Kennel Club has four principal physical locations. Its headquarters are on Clarges Street in Mayfair, London, incorporating a private members&#x27; club (with bar, lounge, and dining facilities), meeting and conference rooms, art gallery, library, picture library, and a residential apartment for the use of the Chairman. A second site at Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, houses the administrative offices, and charitable trust headquarters. The third site is Stoneleigh Park in Warwickshire, where the Kennel Club Building consists of a restaurant, an educational centre, and showground facilities. The fourth location is near Hexham, Northumberland, and is named the Emblehope and Burngrange Estate. It is the KC&#x27;s centre of excellence for working dogs, and consists of 7,550 acres of assorted terrains including farmland (with a working farm), moorland, and woodland. A gamekeeper is employed, enabling gun dogs to engage in shooting parties, whilst the farm has a population of sheep, enabling sheepdog breeds to be trained and demonstrated.

The Kennel Club registration system divides dogs into seven breed groups. The Kennel Club Groups are: Hound group, Working group, Terrier group, Gundog group, Pastoral group, Utility group and Toy group. , The Kennel Club recognised 222 breeds of dog.

The Kennel Club licenses dog shows throughout the UK, but the only dog show it actually runs is Crufts. The show has been held since 1928 and attracts competitors from all over the world. It is held every March at the NEC, Birmingham, and includes the less formal Scruffts show for crossbreed and mixed-breed dogs. The Kennel Club also holds the Discover Dogs event in London every autumn.

The Kennel Club is a non-member partner with the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.

==History==
The Kennel Club was founded on 4 April 1873 after Sewallis E. Shirley became frustrated by trying to organise dog shows without a consistent set of rules. Since the first dog show in 1859, shows had become increasingly popular. Shirley is listed as an exhibitor of Fox Terriers at the Birmingham Dog Show Society show in 1865. Together with a group of other gentlemen, he organised the First Grand Exhibition of Sporting and Other Dogs held at Crystal Palace in June 1870. The show was not a financial success and the organisers had to make up the loss.

This seems to have been the trigger for Shirley to call a meeting with 12 others who had an interest in judging and exhibiting pedigree dogs. The meeting, in 1873, agreed to set up the Kennel Club. It was held at 2 Albert Mansions, Victoria Street, London, a small flat with only three rooms. All business was conducted from there until a move to Pall Mall in May 1877.

It was decided they would be responsible for publishing a Stud Book and the first volume was published and ready to be distributed in December 1874. It listed pedigrees of dogs competing at shows from 1859 and also included a &quot;Code of Rules for the guidance of Dog Shows and Field trials&quot;

Shirley was appointed as chairman at the first annual general meeting of the Kennel Club on 1 December 1874.

The Kennel Club saw particular change under the chairmanship of John MacDougall during the period 1981 to 1996. Among the changes he helped introduce were the revamping of the Club&#x27;s constitution, the development of the Junior Organisation to encourage youth participation in the sport of dog showing, and the creation of the library and the charitable trust. It was also under his stewardship that the registration system became computerised.

==Crufts==

The first successful annual all-breed dog show was produced by Charles Cruft in 1891. He produced the Crufts dog show for 45 years until his death in 1938. His widow, Emma, continued for four shows. She then sold it to the Kennel Club, as she felt unable to devote the time to running such a large undertaking and she wanted to perpetuate her husband&#x27;s legacy. No shows were held during the Second World War. The first Crufts show held by the Kennel Club was in 1948 at Olympia, London. The show was first televised by the BBC in 1950. The 1954 edition was cancelled due to the strike of electricians.

The show moved to Earls Court in 1979, where it remained until staging its centenary show in 1991 at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, where it still takes place. From originally being a show for the exhibition of purebred dogs, it has expanded over the years and now incorporates most other canine disciplines such as Obedience, Agility, and Flyball.

==Discover Dogs==
Initially the Discover Dogs event was staged as a part of Crufts dog show, but as its popularity increased it became a stand-alone event. Established in 1996, it gives the public an opportunity to meet representatives of all pedigree dog breeds and talk with breed experts about the suitability of the breed as a pet.

Until 2014, this two-day annual event was held at Earls Court Exhibition Centre in London in November. Since 2015, it has been held in October at the ExCeL Centre in East London.

The event includes the semi-finals for the Kennel Gazette Junior Warrant competition, a competition for pedigree dogs aged between six and 18 months, and the National Junior Handling UK final, as well as agility competitions and displays by police and other dog teams. There are also a large number of trade stalls. It is popular, with the 2012 event drawing a crowd of over 30,000.

From 2000 to 2012, Discover Dogs also hosted the finals of the Scruffts Family Crossbreed of the Year competition for mixed-breed dogs. Since 2013, this has been held in conjunction with the main Crufts show.

==Kennel Club Charitable Trust==
The Kennel Club Charitable Trust is a dog charity that looks after the welfare and health of dogs. They fund a wide variety of work, including supporting research into canine diseases, dog welfare organisations and the promotion of service dogs. Set up in 1987, it was first registered with the Charity Commission in May 1988. The Duchess of Cornwall became the first patron of the Trust in October 2007 when it celebrated its twentieth anniversary.

The Kennel Club makes many donations to charitable causes, with grants totalling over £10 million between the club&#x27;s foundation and 2020. The Animal Health Trust (AHT) has frequently received donations from the Kennel Club and, in 2012, a £1.5 million interest free loan was granted to the AHT to enable it to complete the building and equipping of a new animal cancer treatment and research centre at its base in Suffolk. The AHT also regularly receives funding to enable work to continue at the Genetics Centre run in conjunction with the Kennel Club. The sum of £250,000 was donated to the Genetics Centre in 2010. During 2010, the Kennel Club Charitable Trust had provided almost £800,000 to help non-pedigree as well as pedigree organisations.

The Kennel Club Charitable Trust also funded a new building at the National Agricultural Centre, Stoneleigh Park, Kenilworth, which was opened by Prince Michael of Kent in February 2009. The facilities are used for various canine related competitions, training, seminars and charity events.

==Kennel Club Dog Art Gallery==
The Kennel Club Dog Art Gallery is located at the club&#x27;s headquarters in Mayfair, London. The gallery is devoted to fine art about dogs and features themed exhibitions, as well as a permanent collection. Artists in the collection include Maud Earl, George Earl, Richard Ansdell, Arthur Wardle and Cecil Aldin. The gallery is open only by appointment.

The art gallery opened in 2003 and was the idea of former Kennel Club Chairman John McDougall. The Kennel Club had accumulated quite a large collection of canine artwork, including 130 oil paintings,100 works on paper, nearly 100 engravings and prints, and the same number of sculptures and trophies. The collection is still being added to. Various exhibitions are held covering a variety of breeds, such as English Setters, Gordon Setters, and Irish Setters. To gain more awareness of the collection available at the art gallery, it sometimes stages exhibitions at art and design fairs. Former Kennel Club chairman Ronnie Irving is quoted as saying &quot;The great thing about the Kennel Club Art Gallery is that it&#x27;s a way of encouraging those people interested in dogs to learn a bit more about art and those people interested in art to do likewise about dogs.&quot;

==Assured Breeder scheme==
The Accredited Breeder Scheme was launched in 2004 but was later renamed as the Assured Breeder scheme (ABS). As the ABS membership grew, a number of regional advisors were recruited to inspect breeders&#x27; premises and paperwork to ensure adequate standards were being met. Breed specific recommendations were added to some breeds for the first time in January 2010 after consultations with breed clubs.

The scheme was meant to help potential dog owners identify responsible breeders, but has been described by the Dogs Trust as &quot;full of pitfalls, the main one being that it&#x27;s self-certificating&quot;. The Associate Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare report indicated that the low breeding standards practiced by some in the ABS may allow the public to be &quot;falsely led into thinking a puppy they buy from an accredited breeder registered with the KC will have no health or welfare problems associated with its breeding history.&quot; It called for more random checks and robust enforcement of the scheme and states that &quot;the use of the word ‘pedigree’ should be tied to a high standard of breeding (for health and welfare) across the board with the KC not just with the few that decide to join the Accredited Breeder Scheme (ABS).&quot;

The report warned that if the health measures implemented by the Kennel Club fails, government regulations might be necessary. The Kennel Club issued a response to the report. &quot;Pedigree Dogs Exposed&quot; producer Jemima Harrison condemned the Kennel Club&#x27;s response, stating that they are downplaying the criticism of the Kennel Club in the report and misrepresenting the findings.

In April 2013, it was announced that the ABS scheme had secured recognition by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS). Various changes were made to the scheme to gain accreditation, which included ensuring inspections were made of all new members&#x27; premises and that those who were already members would be checked within a three-year time period. In January 2010, Prof. Sir Patrick Bateson had advocated seeking UKAS accreditation in his Independent Inquiry into Dog Breeding.

In 2024, The Kennel Club announced the closure of the Assured Breeders Scheme (ABS) by the end of the year. This decision followed a two-year review of the scheme and wider breeder registration practices, which involved extensive research and consultation with breeders. The review highlighted the need for more comprehensive education and support for all breeders, regardless of their experience, and emphasised the importance of expanding initiatives to benefit a greater number of registered dogs.

While the ABS provided educational value and guidance for both breeders and puppy buyers, it accounted for only 5% of puppies registered with The Kennel Club. Challenges cited included barriers to entry, such as membership fees, which limited participation and constrained the scheme’s ability to achieve widespread impact.

The Kennel Club plans to integrate the principles of the ABS into a new registration model that incentivises good breeding practices, promotes health testing, and makes educational resources more accessible to breeders and puppy buyers. In this context, the organisation intends to signpost breeders to additional resources and platforms, such as My Licensed Breeder, which offers tools and guidance to support compliance and responsible breeding practices. These changes aim to improve the overall quality of registered puppies and enhance the support available to breeders and puppy buyers.

Bill Lambert, Health and Breeder Services Executive at The Kennel Club, stated:
“The decision to close the Assured Breeders Scheme is not one we have taken lightly. However, it is clear that we need a more inclusive and impactful approach that supports all breeders, educates puppy buyers, and addresses welfare issues at scale.”

The ABS will officially closed on 31 December 2024. The Kennel Club will engage with breeders in the coming months to develop the new registration model and provide additional details about forthcoming initiatives.

==Other programmes==
In February 2013, the Kennel Club launched a programme called &quot;Get Fit With Fido&quot;, which encouraged dog owners to lose weight by exercising with their dogs.

== &quot;Pedigree Dogs Exposed&quot; ==

The organisation was criticised in an August 2008 BBC programme &quot;Pedigree Dogs Exposed&quot; for allowing breed standards, judging standards and breeding practices which are said to compromise the health of purebred dogs. The programme led various sponsors to withdraw their participation in Crufts and the BBC eventually dropped Crufts 2009 from its coverage. The Kennel Club initially defended their practices, and criticised the programme as &quot;highly biased&quot;. It also lodged a complaint to regulatory authority Ofcom. Ofcom rejected the Kennel Club&#x27;s claim of unfair editing and deceit, but found that the BBC did not give the Kennel Club &quot;a proper opportunity to respond&quot; to allegations that the club was &quot;eugenicist&quot; and (per Ofcom&#x27;s characterisation of the programme&#x27;s allegations) that it &quot;shared a common ideology with Nazi racial theory&quot;, nor to an allegation that it covered up the nature of an operation carried out on a Crufts Best in Show winner.

Due to the strong public response, the Kennel Club started rolling out new health plans. Breed standards for every breed went under review and show judges would be required to choose only healthy dogs. New breed standards were announced in January 2009 and close inbreeding was banned.

<text>Johannes Carsten Hauch (12 May 1790 – 4 March 1872) was a Danish poet.

==Biography==
Hauch was born in Frederikshald in Norway. His father was the Danish bailiff in Smaalenene, Frederik Hauch. His mother, Karen Tank was sister of Norwegian ship merchant and parliament president Carsten Tank. In 1802 Hauch lost his mother, and in 1803 returned with his father to Denmark. In 1807 he fought as a volunteer against the English invasion. He entered the university of Copenhagen in 1808, and in 1821 took his doctors degree. He became the friend and associate of Steffens and Oehlenschläger, warmly adopting the romantic views about poetry and philosophy.

His first two dramatic poems, &quot;The Journey to Ginistan&quot; and &quot;The Power of Fancy&quot;, appeared in 1816, and were followed by a lyrical drama, &quot;Rosaurn&quot; (1817); but these works attracted little or no attention. Hauch therefore gave up all hope of fame as a poet, and resigned himself entirely to the study of science. He took his doctors degree in zoology in 1821, and went abroad to pursue his studies. At Nice he had an accident which obliged him to submit to the amputation of one foot.

He returned to literature, publishing a dramatized fairy tale, the &quot;Hamadryad&quot;, and the tragedies of &quot;Bajazet&quot;, &quot;Tiberius&quot;, &quot;Gregory VII&quot;, in 1828-1829, &quot;The Death of Charles V&quot; (1831), and &quot;The Siege of Maestricht&quot; (1832). These plays were violently attacked and enjoyed no success. Hauch then turned to novel-writing, and published in succession five romances &quot;Vilhelm Zabern&quot; (1834); &quot;The Alchemist&quot; (1836); &quot;A Polish Family&quot; (1839); &quot;The isle on the Rhine&quot; (1845); and &quot;Robert Fulton&quot; (1853).

In 1842 he collected his shorter &quot;Poems&quot;. In 1846 he was appointed professor of Scandinavian languages in Kiel, but returned to Copenhagen when war broke out in 1848. About this time his dramatic talent was at its height, and he produced one admirable tragedy after another; among these may be mentioned &quot;Svend Grathe&quot; (1841); &quot;The Sisters at Kinnekullen&quot; (1849); &quot;Marshal Sag&quot; (1850); &quot;Honour Lost and Won&quot; (1851) and &quot;Tycho Brahe&#x27;s Youth&quot; (1852). From 1858 to 1860 Hauch was director of the Danish National Theatre; he produced three more tragedies: &quot;The King&#x27;s Favourite&quot; (1859); &quot;Henry of Navarre&quot; (1863); and &quot;Julian the Apostate&quot; (1866). In 1861 he published another collection of &quot;Lyrical Poems and Romances&quot; and in 1862 the historical epic of &quot;Valdemar Seir&quot;.

From 1851, when he succeeded Oehlenschläger, to his death, he held the honorary post of professor of aesthetics at the university of Copenhagen. He died in Rome in 1872, and was buried at the Cimitero acattolico.

Hauch was one of the most prolific of the Danish poets. His lyrics and romances in verse are always line in form and often strongly imaginative. In all his writings, but especially in his tragedies, he displays a strong bias in favor of what is mystical and supernatural. Of his dramas &quot;Marshal Stig&quot; is perhaps the best, and of his novels the patriotic tale of &quot;Vilhelm Zabern&quot; is admired the most.

Hauch&#x27;s novels were collected (1873–1874) and his dramatic works (3 volumes, 2nd edition, 1852–1859).

<doc id="413477" wikidata="Q855915" url="?curid=413477" title="Kurta">
<text>A kurta is a loose collarless shirt or tunic worn in many regions of South Asia, and now also worn around the world. Tracing its roots to Central Asian nomadic tunics, or upper body garments, of the late-ancient- or early-medieval era, the kurta has evolved stylistically over the centuries, especially in South Asia, as a garment for everyday wear as well as for formal occasions.

The kurta is traditionally made of cotton or silk. It is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as &quot;chikan&quot;; and it can be loose or tight in the torso, typically falling either just above or somewhere below the knees of the wearer. The front and back of a traditional kurta are made of rectangular pieces, and its side-seams are left open at the bottom, up to varying lengths, to enable ease of movement.

The sleeves of a traditional kurta fall to the wrist without narrowing, the ends hemmed but not cuffed; the kurta can be worn by both men and women; it is traditionally collarless, though standing collars are increasingly popular. Kurtas are traditionally worn over ordinary pajamas, loose shalwars, or churidars. Among urban youth, kurtas are being increasingly worn over jeans, not only in South Asia, but also in the South Asian diaspora, both the recently established, and the longstanding. Young women and girls in urban areas are increasingly wearing &quot;kurtis&quot;, which are short hip-length kurtas, with jeans or leggings, in addition to more traditional lower-body garments.

== History ==
According to author Roshen Alkazi, stitched (&quot;i.e.&quot; cut and sewn) attire came to South Asia from Central Asia. There was a trickle during the Scythian/Parthian/Kushan invasions of the late ancient period. with Mahmud of Ghazni, the floodgates opening with the Muslim conquests of the late 12th century, until the kurta became an item of common attire during the early modern era.

According to Alkazi: ...In the Ghaznavid period, we have only one clear visual reference to their actual costume, those worn by the Mamluk (slave) palace guards of Mahmud of Ghazni, in the wall paintings of Lashkari Bazaar in Afghanistan. They wear the &quot;qaba&quot; made of rich patterned textiles. This was a mid-calf length tunic with long narrow sleeves and &quot;tiraz&quot;. The opening is from right to left and has a small loop for closing it higher at the left shoulder. This closing at the left shoulder was one of the earliest forms of neck closing and a relic of this is still seen in the Russian tunic and in the contemporary &quot;kurtas&quot; used in certain parts of India, both of which close at the left shoulder. (p 467) 

==Styles==
A traditional kurta is composed of rectangular fabric pieces with perhaps a few gusset inserts, and is cut so as to leave no waste fabric. The cut is usually simple, although decorative treatments can be elaborate.

The sleeves of a traditional kurta fall straight to the wrist; they do not narrow, as do many Western-cut sleeves. Sleeves are not cuffed, just hemmed and decorated.

The front and back pieces of a simple kurta are also rectangular. The side seams are left open for 6-12 inches above the hem, also referred to as the &quot;chāk&quot;, which gives the wearer some ease of movement. (Note: &quot;chāk&quot; derives from the Persian &quot;چاك ćāk, Fissure, cleft, rent, slit, a narrow opening intentionally left in clothes).&quot;

The kurta usually opens in the front; some styles, however, button at the shoulder seam. The front opening is often a hemmed slit in the fabric, tied or buttoned at the top; some kurtas, however, have plackets rather than slits. The opening may be centered on the chest, or positioned off center.

A traditional kurta does not have a collar. Modern variants may feature stand-up collars of the type known to tailors and seamstresses as &quot;mandarin&quot; collars. These are the same sort of collars seen on achkans, sherwanis, and Nehru jackets.

==Material==

Kurtas worn in the summer months are usually made of thin silk or cotton fabrics; winter season kurtas are made of thicker fabric such as wool or &quot;Khadi silk&quot;, a thick, coarse, handspun and handwoven silk that may be mixed with other fibers. A very common fabric for the kurta pajama is linen, or a linen-cotton mix ideal for both summers and winters.

Kurtas are typically fastened with tasselled ties, cloth balls, and loops, or buttons. Buttons are often wood or plastic. Kurtas worn on formal occasions might feature decorative metal buttons, which are not sewn to the fabric, but, like cufflinks, are fastened into the cloth when needed. Such buttons can be decorated with jewels, enameling, and other traditional jewelers&#x27; techniques.

==Decoration==
Tailors from the South Asia command a vast repertoire of methods, traditional and modern, for decorating fabric. It is likely that all of them have been used, at one time or another, to decorate kurtas. However, the most common decoration is embroidery. Many light summer kurtas feature Chikan embroidery, a specialty of Lucknow, around the hems and front opening. This embroidery is typically executed on light, semi-transparent fabric in a matching thread.

==Regional variants==
Regional styles include the Bhopali, Hyderabadi, Lucknowi and straight-cut kurtas. The Bhopali kurta (taking its name from Bhopal) is a loose kurta with pleats at the waist, flowing like a skirt reaching midway between the knees and the ankles. The Hyderabadi kurta is named after the former royal state of Hyderabad and is a short top which sits around the waist, with a keyhole neck opening. It was popular with the local royal households. Traditionally, the Hyderabadi kurta was of white material, but modern versions can be of any colour. Over the kurta, some versions have net material, the combination of which is called &quot;jaali karga&quot;, worn by men and women.
The traditional Lucknowi kurta can either be short or long, using as much as 12 yards of cloth. The traditional Lucknowi kurta styles have an overlapping panel. However, the term &quot;Lucknowi kurta&quot; now applies to the straight-cut kurta embroidered using local Chikan embroidery. Another style is the kali or kalidar kurta which is similar to a frock and has many panels. The kalidar kurta is made up of several geometrical pieces. It has two rectangular central panels in the back and the front. The kali kurta is worn by men and women.

The straight-cut traditional kurta is known as a &quot;panjabi&quot; in Bangladesh, West Bengal and Assam. Local embroidery designs give a regional outlook to the traditional kurta. In Assam, the Panjabi is worn with a scarf (Gamosa) using local prints. Other designs include Bengali Kantha embroidery; Multani crocheted designs of Multan (Punjab, Pakistan); the Phulkari kurta using the Phulkari embroidery of the Punjab region; Bandhani tye-dyeing of the Cholistan Desert; Delhi style kurtas which include the wooden beaded kurta and a kurta heavily laden with embroidery;

Sindhi kurtas called Pehran/Pehriyan in Sindhi are made out of many Sindhi embroideries like Kacha, Pakka, Hurmuch, Muka, Pani etc, Sindhi kurtas are also made of applique called &quot;Tuk ja Kurta&quot; Sindhi kurtas utilise mirrors and the local art of bandhani (creating patterned textiles by resisting parts of a fabric by tying knots on it before it is dyed). Sindhi kurtas are worn by both men and females the female kurtas are called &quot;Padhri&quot; which are tied at either side of shoulder are heavily embroidered with heavy embellishments like mirrorwork, pompoms (phundra), sequins, cowries, shells, beads and buttons, the male kurtas are called Pehran or Pehriyan which are embroidered as well, and are collarless having either side neck or center necks.

Traditional Punjabi kurta of the Punjab region is wide and falls to the knees and is cut straight. The modern version of the regional kurta is the Muktsari kurta which originates from Muktsar in Punjab. This modern Punjabi kurta is famous for its slim-fitting cuts and smart fit designs. It is very popular among young politicians.

===Jeans and straight-cut kurta===
Kurtas are often worn with jeans. Women sometimes wear kurtas as blouses, usually over jeans pants. Jeans are sometimes preferred over pajamas or leggings as they are more durable for rough use. Most colours of kurtas match with blue jeans. In 2014, an Indian family court in Mumbai ruled that a husband objecting to his wife wearing a kurta and jeans and forcing her to wear a sari amounts to cruelty inflicted by the husband and can be a ground to seek divorce. The wife was thus granted a divorce on the ground of cruelty as defined under section 27(1)(d) of Special Marriage Act, 1954.

===Leggings and straight cut kurta===
Ladies&#x27; kurtas/blouses, along with leggings, are most popular in South Asia, and the community from South Asia in Singapore and Malaysia.

===Kurti===
In modern usage, a short kurta for women is referred to as the kurti. However, traditionally, the kurti refers to waistcoats, jackets and blouses which sit above the waist without side slits, and are believed to have descended from the tunic of the Shunga period (2nd century B.C.). Kurtis are typically much shorter than the traditional garments and made with lighter materials, like those used in sewing kameez.

<text>The Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), also known as &quot;Al-Jama&#x27;a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya&quot; (), was an armed Islamist group. Militants participated in the 2011 Libyan Civil War as the Libyan Islamic Movement (&quot;al-Harakat al-Islamiya al-Libiya&quot;), and are involved in the Libyan Civil War as members of the Libya Shield Force. Alleged militants include alleged Al Qaeda organizer Abd al-Muhsin Al-Libi who now holds a key command position in the Libya Shield Force.

In the 2011 civil war, members claim to have played a key role in deposing Muammar Gaddafi. The force was part of the National Transitional Council.

However the organisation has a troubled history being under pressure from Muammar Gaddafi and shortly after the September 11 attacks, LIFG was banned worldwide (as an affiliate of al-Qaeda) by the UN 1267 Committee. Listed at the Foreign Terrorist Organizations, the group has denied ever being affiliated with al-Qaeda, stating that it refused to join the global Islamic front Osama bin Laden declared against the west in 1998.

==History==
LIFG was founded in 1995 by Libyans who had fought against Soviet forces in Afghanistan. Its objective was to establish an Islamic state in Libya. According to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the group viewed the Gaddafi regime as oppressive and anti-Muslim, and aimed to overthrow it. The group&#x27;s first armed action came in Benghazi on September 6-7, 1995, resulting in the deaths of some 30 individuals. LIFG claimed responsibility for a failed assassination attempt against Gaddafi in February 1996, which was in part funded by MI6 according to David Shayler, and engaged Libyan security forces in armed clashes during the mid-to-late 1990s. They continued to target Libyan interests and engaged in sporadic clashes with Libyan security forces.

Adnkronos International reported that the group was founded in Afghanistan by Abu Laith Al Libi and other veterans of Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.

===Relationship with Al-Qaeda===
The LIFG links to Al-Qaeda hail from Afghanistan, where hundreds joined Al-Qaeda. High ranking LIFG operatives inside Al-Qaeda, are the leader of the insurgency Abdel-Hakim Belhadj (also known as Abu Abdullah al-Sadiq), and the recently killed Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, who was killed in a CIA drone strike, and Al-Qaeda&#x27;s Abu Yahya al-Libi.

&quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported that senior Al Qaeda members Abu Yahya al-Libi and Abu Laith al-Libi were LIFG members. One of al-Qaeda&#x27;s most senior members, Atiyah Abdul-Rahman, was purportedly a member of LIFG as well.

In an audio message published in November 2007 Ayman al-Zawahiri and Abu Laith al-Libi claimed that the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group had joined al-Qaeda. &quot;Benotman fired back an open letter to Zawahiri questioning his credibility. &quot;I questioned their idea of jihad ... directly you know. This is crazy, it is not Islamic and it&#x27;s against the Sunni understanding of Islam,&quot; Benotman told CNN. Zawahiri chose not to respond. As late as this August Zawahiri&#x27;s video statements included praise of LIFG leaders, in what may have been a desperate attempt to head off the condemnation he could see coming.&quot;

In November 2007 Noman Benotman, described as the &quot;ex-head of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group&quot;, published on open letter to al-Qaeda. According to &quot;The Times&quot;:

In November last year Noman Benotman, ex-head of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group which is trying to overthrow the regime of Muammar Gaddafi, published a letter which asked Al-Qaeda to give up all its operations in the Islamic world and in the West, adding that ordinary westerners were blameless and should not be attacked.

Noman Benotman&#x27;s letter to Zawahiri was published in Akhbar Libya (News) as an op-ed clarification in November 2007. The gist is that al-Qaeda&#x27;s efforts have been counterproductive and used as &quot;subterfuge&quot; by some Western countries to extend their regional ambitions. These comments were first aired at a meeting in Kandahar in the summer of 2000.

On 10 July 2009, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported that some member organisations of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group had split with Al Qaeda.

====UK Terrorism Act 2000====
On 10 October 2005, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Home Office banned LIFG and fourteen other militant groups from operating in the UK. Under the United Kingdom&#x27;s Terrorism Act 2000, being a member of a LIFG is punishable with a 10-year prison term. The Financial Sanctions Unit of the Bank of England acting on behalf of HM Treasury issued the orders to freeze all their assets. Mohammed Benhammedi lived and worked in Liverpool at the time of the UN sanction against him. Sergey Zakurko, the father to his Lithuanian mistress was suspended from his job at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant (INPP) for fear that the link could pose a security threat.

The group was delisted from the United Kingdom proscribed organizations list in November 2019.

====UN-embargoed LIFG affiliates and their subsequent de-listing====
On 7 February 2006 the UN embargoed five specific LIFG members and four corporations, all of whom had continued to operate in England until at least October 2005. Those nine are in the following table; the accusations are according to the US State Department.
Al-Faqih, Nasuf, and a third man appealed being listed. Their appeal went all the way to the European Union&#x27;s Court, which ordered the UK to delist the men, and return their passports.

The &quot;Summary of Evidence&quot; from Mohammed Fenaitel Mohamed Al Daihani&#x27;s Combatant Status Review Tribunal states: &quot;The Sanabal Charitable Committee is considered a fund raising front for the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group.&quot;

In June 2011, all of the entities included in the table above were de-listed by the United Nations Security Council Committee.

===Reconciliation and mass release of prisoners===

In September 2009 a new &quot;code&quot; for jihad, a 417-page religious document entitled &quot;Corrective Studies&quot;, was published after more than two years of intense and secret talks between incarcerated leaders of the LIFG and Libyan security officials.

On 9 April 2008, Al Jazeera reported that Libya released at least over 90 members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. The Italian press agency Adnkronos International reported the release was due to the efforts of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, a son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, and leader of the charity Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations. It reported that a third of the LIFG members Libya was holding were released. A further 200 prisoners were released in March 2010, including group leader Abdelhakim Belhadj.

In January 2011 members of the group threatened a return to violence unless still imprisoned members were released.

===Libyan Civil War===
In March 2011, members of the LIFG in Ajdabiya declared to the press that the group supports the revolt against Gaddafi&#x27;s rule, and had placed themselves under the leadership of the National Transitional Council. They also stated that the group had changed its name to Libyan Islamic Movement (&quot;al-Harakat al-Islamiya al-Libiya&quot;), had around 500–600 militants released from jail in recent years, and denied any past or present affiliation with Al-Qaeda.

A leader of the LIFG, Abdelhakim Belhadj, became the commander of the Tripoli Military Council after the rebels took over Tripoli during the 2011 Battle of Tripoli. In March 2011, Abdel-Hakim al-Hasidi, a leading member of the group, admit to the Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore that his fighters had al-Qaeda links. Al-Hasidi was captured in 2002 in Peshwar, Pakistan, later handed over to the US, and then held in Libya before being released in 2008. He admit in the same interview that he had earlier fought against &quot;the foreign invasion&quot; of Afghanistan.

In September 2011, Ismail Sallabi (a leader of LIFG) said in an interview to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;: &quot;We want [Libyan Islamic Movement] to be a good government that comes from Islam, that respects human rights and personal freedoms,&quot; &quot;The Islamic way is not something dangerous or wrong. The West hears &#x27;Islamic law&#x27; and they think we want to lock our women in boxes,&quot; &quot;The Islamic groups want a democratic country, and they want to go to the mosque without being arrested. They&#x27;re looking for freedom like everyone else.&quot;

<text>Henrik Steffens (2 May 1773 – 13 February 1845), was a Norwegian philosopher, scientist, and poet.

==Early life, education, and lectures==
He was born at Stavanger. At the age of fourteen he went with his parents to Copenhagen, where he studied theology and natural science. In 1796 he lectured at the University of Kiel, and two years later went to the University of Jena to study the natural philosophy of Friedrich Schelling. He went to Freiberg in 1800, and there came under the influence of Abraham Gottlob Werner. In 1801, he published a volume on geology called &quot;Beiträge zur inneren Naturgeschichte der Erde. (Contributions to the inner natural history of the Earth)&quot; which became his most successful and influential work as a scientist. He there defended a &quot;Neptunist&quot; theory of the origin of the Earth against the &quot;Vulcanist&quot; theory later to be defended by his fellow student in Freiberg, Alexander von Humboldt. 

After two years he returned to Copenhagen, and is said to have introduced German romanticism to Denmark in 1802 with nine lectures given at Elers Kollegium, later published as &quot;Indledning til philosophiske Forelæsninger&quot; (&quot;Introduction to Philosophical Lectures&quot;). These lectures were a great success and a source of inspiration in Danish romanticism. They were attended by many who later became leading Danish thinkers, such as Oehlenschläger and Grundtvig. Friedrich Schleiermacher was so much struck by their excellence that he endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to obtain for Steffens a chair in the new Berlin University in 1804, in order that his own ethical teachings should be supported in the scientific department.

==Professorship and theories==
Despite – or perhaps because of – the deep impact made by his lectures, Steffens was not made welcome by the Danish authorities. He moved back to Germany and took up a professorship at the University of Halle in 1804, to return to Denmark only occasionally. During the Battle of Leipzig (1813) he enlisted in the Prussian Army as a second lieutenant, and he was present at the capture of Paris the following year. He was professor of physics at Breslau from 1811 until 1832, when he accepted an invitation to Berlin.

Steffens was one of the so-called &quot;Philosophers of Nature&quot;, a friend and adherent of Schelling and of Schleiermacher. More than either of these two thinkers he was acquainted with the discoveries of modern science, and was thus able to correct or modify the highly imaginative speculations of Schelling. He held that, throughout the scheme of nature and intellectual life, the main principle is Individualisation. As organisms rise higher in the scale of development, the sharper and more distinct become their outlines, the more definite their individualities. This principle he endeavoured to deduce from his knowledge of geology, in contrast to Lorenz Oken, who developed the same theory on biological grounds. His influence was considerable, and both Schelling and Schleiermacher modified their theories in deference to his scientific deductions.

His chief scientific and philosophical works are:
*&quot;Beiträge zur inneren Naturgeschichte der Erde&quot; (1801)
*&quot;Grundzuge der philosophischen Naturwissenschaft&quot; (1806)
*&quot;Anthropologie&quot; (1824)
*&quot;Ueber die idee der Universitäten&quot; (1835)
*&quot;Ueber geheime Verbindungen auf Universitaten&quot; (1835)
*&quot;Karikaturen des Heiligsten&quot; (1819–1821)
*&quot;Wie ich wieder Lutheraner wurde und was mir das Luthertum ist&quot; (1831)
*&quot;Von tIer falschen Theolegie und dem wahren Glauben&quot; (new ed., 1831)
*&quot;Die Familien Walseth&quot; and &quot;Leith&quot; (1827)
*&quot;Die vier Norweger&quot; (1828)
*&quot;Malcolm&quot; (1831)

During the last five years of his life he wrote an autobiography, &quot;Was ich erlebte&quot;, and after his death his &quot;Nachgelassene Schriften&quot; (1846) was published. See Tietzen, &quot;Zur Erinnerung an Steffens&quot;; Petersen, &quot;Henrik Steffens&quot; (German translation, 1884); Dilthey, &quot;Leben Schleiermachers&quot;.

==Legacy==
Henrik Steffens has been an influential figure in the Scandinavian history of Romanticism and was a towering figure in the effort to combine the emerging natural sciences with new Romantic ideas about nature. These were to a certain extent neglected in the 20th century as more positivism and naturalism dominated within the natural sciences. However, with the emergence of the Anthropocene, Steffens&#x27; ideas have been rediscovered as a source of inspiration for interdisciplinary perspectives on ecology and the earth sciences.

The Henrik Steffens Professor, a named chair at the Humboldt University of Berlin in the field of humanities and social sciences, is funded by the Government of Norway and administered jointly by the Humboldt University and the University of Oslo. The professorship was established in connection with the state visit of German President Roman Herzog in Norway in 1998, on the initiative of Lucy Smith, the Rector of the University of Oslo. The purpose of the professorship is to promote academic cooperation between Norway and Germany in the fields of humanities and social sciences, &quot;in the spirit of Henrik Steffens.&quot; It is one of the nine named chairs at the Humboldt University.

The professorship is hosted by the Department of Northern European Studies at the Humboldt University, which is located near Unter den Linden. The department also hosts the Dag Hammarskjöld Professorship, which is funded by the Swedish government.

<doc id="413484" wikidata="Q3433493" url="?curid=413484" title="Shoot the chute">
<text>Shoot the chute is an amusement ride consisting of a flat-bottomed boat that slides down a ramp or inside a flume into a lagoon. Unlike a log flume or super flume, which generally seats up to eight passengers, a modern-day shoot-the-chute ride generally has larger boats seating at least four across.

==History==

The first of this type of amusement ride was built by J.P. Newburg in 1884 down the side of a hill at Watchtower Park in Rock Island, Illinois. The ride traveled along a greased wooden track, skipping across the Rock River at the bottom. It was then pulled back to the ramp by an onboard ride attendant. Newburg took this unique ride concept next to Chicago, where more flumes were built and the rides grew in popularity.

Paul Boyton opened Paul Boyton&#x27;s Water Chute, America&#x27;s first modern amusement park, at 63rd and Drexel in Chicago, on July 4, 1894. Boyton&#x27;s was the first amusement park to rely solely on mechanical attractions. Paul Boyton and Thomas Polk built another example in 1895 for Sea Lion Park at Coney Island. The ride was widely copied and &quot;chute&quot; rides were found at many amusement parks throughout the United States, and even became the name of several amusement parks. While the original form of the ride is largely obsolete, modern log flume rides work on similar principles.

On the earliest chute rides, the flat-bottomed boat was pulled up the ramp by cable, sometimes with a turnaround on a small turntable. In the ride at Sea Lion Park, the passengers arrived at the top by elevator. The bottom of the ramp curved upwards, causing the boat to skip across the water until it came to a stop. The boat was guided to a landing by a boatman on board. The oldest ride of this type still in operation is the boat chute constructed in 1926 and 1927 located at Lake Winnepesaukah Amusement Park in Rossville, Georgia, near Chattanooga, Tennessee. An operating modern reproduction of the Luna Park shoot-the-chute ride of the early 20th century, The Pittsburg Plunge, is currently in operation at Kennywood amusement park in Pennsylvania.

Water chutes were also a popular attraction in the United Kingdom in the late-19th and early-20th centuries, with large multi-chute examples built at Blackpool, the Bradford Exhibition, Earls Court Exhibition Centre, and Southport, all now demolished. Smaller single-chute versions are extant and operating at East Park, Kingston upon Hull, Peasholm Park, Scarborough, and Wicksteed Park, Kettering. A large single chute ride was built at the Battersea Park funfair - now demolished - and was an integral park of a chase sequence in the 1959 &quot;Dial 999&quot; episode &quot;Inside Job&quot;.

==Modern rides==
The shoot-the-chute concept has evolved over time in the amusement park industry. All modern shoot-the-chute rides feature a guide track after the descent down the chute into the pool of water that allows the boats to return to the loading platform—completing a closed-circuit track. Most modern shoot-the-chute rides usually consist of (though not limited to) an oval-shaped layout or a figure-eight layout. Many shoot-the-chute installations also have an observation platform or bridge so that spectators, in addition to riders, can get wet from the splash created by the boats.

Hopkins Rides built many 50-foot-tall shoot-the-chute rides in the 1980s, and in 1994 completed the Tidal Force at Hersheypark--then billed as the tallest such ride in the world. The force of the wave of water hitting the bridge caused several minor injuries to guests, necessitating clear plastic barriers being installed.

Intamin took the shoot-the-chute concept further in 2000 with the opening of its first Mega Splash, Perilous Plunge at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm. At its opening, it was the tallest and steepest water flume ride in the world. Three seven-ton 24-passenger boats would climb a 121-foot (36.8 m) lift-hill, round a curve and descend a 115-foot (35 m) water chute at a 77.8-degree slope. Upon landing in the lagoon below, the boats created a 45-foot (13.7 m) high splash that drenched riders as well as spectators standing on an observation bridge overlooking the ride. The ride used an adjustable electromagnetic braking system to control the volume of the splash. A similar ride, Hydro, was later constructed at Oakwood Theme Park in Wales, UK. Perilous Plunge was removed from the park in 2012.

Schlitterbahn in Corpus Christi, Texas, opened &quot;Padre Plunge&quot; in May 2017. This ride previously stood at Alabama Splash Adventure where it was known as &quot;Buzzsaw Falls&quot;. It was damaged by Hurricane Harvey three months later and the ride permanently closed to the public. It was demolished in March 2020.

<text>Dalton Kingsley Camp (September 11, 1920 – March 18, 2002) was a Canadian journalist, politician, political strategist and commentator, and supporter of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. Although he was never elected to a seat in the Canadian House of Commons, he was a prominent and influential politician and a popular commentator for decades. He is a central figure in Red Toryism.

== Background==
Camp was born in Woodstock, New Brunswick. His father was a Baptist minister whose work took his family to Connecticut and later California. Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1937, Camp&#x27;s mother and her children returned to their hometown of Woodstock.

Camp soon enrolled in undergraduate studies at Acadia University, but his time there was interrupted by enlistment in the Canadian Army during the Second World War. After the war, Camp finished his undergraduate studies in the liberal arts at the University of New Brunswick, followed by graduate studies in journalism at Columbia University and political science at the London School of Economics.

His daughter Cherie Camp has worked as a musician and actress.

== Political involvement==
While involved in studies at the University of New Brunswick, Camp worked briefly for the Liberal Party of Canada and its provincial wing, the New Brunswick Liberal Association. Later, Camp was heavily influenced by his studies at the London School of Economics, and upon his return to Canada, he sought to distance himself from what he now felt was the arrogance of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Ruling Party,&quot; the Liberals. Camp had some socialist beliefs which attracted him to the Liberal Party, but he was also attracted to the traditions of Canadian conservatism and so he ultimately found a political home within the Red Tory wing of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

Living in Toronto in the 1950s, Camp worked with several public relations firms and through his speaking, organizational, and political abilities was influential during several provincial elections in Canada that saw Progressive Conservative governments elected for the first time in more than a generation. Camp was also instrumental in helping John Diefenbaker, the leader of the federal party, win elections in 1957 and 1958 although he personally mistrusted Diefenbaker. After the PC defeat to Lester Pearson&#x27;s Liberals in 1963, Camp sought to reorganize the party, and he became president of the national party the following year.

Faced with evidence that most of the party was unhappy with Diefenbaker&#x27;s policies, which were increasingly eccentric and autocratic, Camp led a grassroots campaign within the party for a leadership review. After the decision was made to have a leadership convention in 1967, Camp left the presidency of the party and briefly considered campaigning for leadership of the party, but when Robert Stanfield decided to run, Camp lent his support to Stanfield&#x27;s campaign.

Camp ran as a candidate for Parliament in the 1963 and 1968 elections, but he personally failed to be elected.

==Later life==
Camp retired as a politician and pursued interests in advertising, political commentary, and journalism. He headed an advertising firm, aptly named &quot;Camp Associates&quot;. In the 1980s and the 1990s, he became a regular political commentator on CBC&#x27;s &quot;Morningside&quot;, along with Stephen Lewis and Eric Kierans, and he was a biweekly political writer for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; newspaper. He also wrote regular columns for the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; and the &quot;Saint John Telegraph-Journal&quot; newspapers for many years.

Camp returned briefly to active politics when he was named a senior advisor to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney&#x27;s staff from 1986 to 1989, including consulting for the 1988 election, which saw Mulroney&#x27;s government campaign for a free trade agreement with the United States. Camp left politics in 1989 with some disillusionment toward the increasing Blue Tory policies of Mulroney&#x27;s government and several decisions that were leading to western disillusionment in the caucus. That would become evident when the Reform Party of Canada was established.

In 1993, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

Camp underwent a heart transplant in 1993, the oldest person in Canada to do so at the time, and he continued to write and give political commentary from his home in Jemseg, New Brunswick.

He experienced a stroke in February 2002, which led to his death a month later at a hospital in Fredericton.

<text>Diego Silang y Andaya (; December 16, 1730 – May 28, 1763) was a Filipino revolutionary leader who allied with British forces to overthrow Spanish rule in the northern Philippines and establish an independent Ilocano state. His revolt was fueled by grievances stemming from Spanish taxation and abuses, and by his belief in self-government, that the administration and leadership of the Roman Catholic Church and government in the Ilocos be invested in trained Ilocano officials. His wife, the Itneg Gabriela Cariño, took on leadership of his revolt after his assassination.

==Historical accounts==
&quot;Diego de Silang, a Filipino, very quick and artful, and who being a native of Manila [ie island of Luzon], spoke the Spanish language well, began to revolutionize this province, by telling his countrymen, that in order to maintain the Catholic faith, and to preserve the country in obedience to the King, it was requisite to join together and arm against the Spaniards, and deliver them up to the English, against whom they had no means of resistance. These specious arguments made an impression on the minds of the chiefs, and many plebeians, particularly those of Vigan, which is the capital of the province, and residence of the Bishop. The seduced Filipinos presented themselves armed, and demanded that the Alcalde should give up the staff of government, and deposit it in the hands of the Vicar-general. The majority advised the Alcalde to defend himself against this attack; but instigated by his fears, or swayed by the opinion of injudicious friends, he resigned the command to the Vicar-general, and with no inconsiderable share of hazard of his life, effected his escape from the province. Emboldened by their success in this instance, the rebels demanded of the Bishop elect, Señor Ustariz, a Dominican, an exemption from the tribute, declaring that they acted justifiable in deposing the Alcalde. The Bishop pledged himself to lay before Señor Anda a favourable representation of their claims; but Silang being determined on acquiring the command, and little satisfied with what he had done, began to collect troops for more extensive operations.&quot;

Joaquín Martínez de Zúñiga (1805)

== Early life ==
Diego Silang was born on December 16, 1730 in Aringay, which was then a part of Pangasinan. Today, this area is encompassed by present-day Caba or Aringay in La Union. His father was Pangasinense, while his mother was Ilocano. He was baptized on January 7, 1731 in Vigan in the then-undivided province of Ilocos. There, young Diego worked as a messenger for a local Castilian priest. Bright, passionate, and fluent in Spanish, he ferried correspondence from the Ilocos to Manila; journeys that gave him his first glimpse of colonial injustice and that planted the seed of rebellion.

== Revolt ==

Spain allied with France during the Seven Years&#x27; War, in opposition to Great Britain. The British in response sought to weaken the Spanish Empire. The seizure of Manila by British naval forces in October 1762, and the subsequent surrender of the Spanish Philippines to Britain during the British occupation of the Philippines, inspired uprisings in the farthest north of Ilocos Norte and Cagayan, where anti-Spanish sentiments festered. Though Silang initially wanted to replace Spanish functionaries in the Ilocos with native-born officials and volunteered to head Ilocano forces on the side of the Spanish, desperate Spanish administrators instead transferred their powers to the Catholic Bishop of Nueva Segovia, who rejected Silang&#x27;s offer.

== Assassination ==

Diego Silang was killed on May 28, 1763 by one of his friends, a Spanish-Ilocano mestizo named Miguel Vicos, whom church authorities paid to assassinate Silang with the help of Pedro Becbec. He was 32 years old.

== Legacy ==
After Silang&#x27;s death, his Spanish-Itneg mestiza wife, Gabriela Silang, took command of the revolt and fought courageously. The Spanish sent a strong force against her. She was forced to retreat to what is now Abra. Gabriela led her troops towards Vigan but was driven back. She fled again to Abra, where she was captured. Gabriela and her men were summarily hanged on September 20, 1763, she being hanged the last.

== In popular culture ==
* Portrayed by Gardo Versoza in the 1995 TV Series &quot;Bayani&quot; in this episode &quot;Diego Silang: Ang Sulat&quot;.
* Portrayed by JC Tiuseco in the 2013 TV series, &quot;Indio&quot;.
* Portrayed by Marc Abaya in &quot;Wagas&quot; in this episode &quot;Wagas: Diego at Gabriela Silang&quot;.

<text>Friedrich Ludwig Zacharias Werner (18 November 1768 – 17 January 1823) was a German poet, dramatist, and preacher. As a dramatist, he is known mainly for inaugurating the era of the so-called &quot;tragedies of fate&quot;.

==Biography==
Werner was born at Königsberg in East Prussia. At the University of Königsberg, he studied law and attended Kant&#x27;s lectures. Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Rousseau&#x27;s German disciples were also influences that shaped his view of life. He lived an irregular life and entered a series of unsuccessful marriages. However his talent was soon recognized, and in 1793 he became chamber secretary in the Prussian service in Warsaw. In 1805 he obtained a government post in Berlin, but two years later he retired from the public service in order to travel.

In the course of his travels, and by correspondence, Werner became acquainted with many eminent literary figures of the time, for example Goethe at Weimar and Madame de Staël at Coppet. At Rome, he joined the Roman Catholic Church in 1811. He was consecrated a priest in 1814 at Aschaffenburg, and, exchanging the pen for the pulpit, became a popular preacher in Vienna, where, during a congress in 1814, his eloquent sermons were listened to by crowded congregations. He was later appointed head of the chapter of the cathedral of Kaminiec.

Werner died in Vienna.

==Works==
He succeeded in having his plays put on the stage, where they met with much success. Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Attila&quot; is based on Werner&#x27;s drama of the same name. Werner&#x27;s &quot;Der 24. Februar&quot;, thus titled because his mother and an intimate friend died on that day, introduced the era of the so-called &quot;tragedies of fate.&quot; Several of his dramatic poems were designed to evangelize freemasonry. His dramatic duology published in English as &quot;The Templars in Cyprus&quot; and &quot;The Brethren of the Cross&quot; was based on the idea that some survivors of the Templar suppression escaped to Scotland and founded Freemasonry. Beethoven considered the first part as a possible opera project.

Among his titles were:

*&quot;Vermischte Gedichte&quot;, 1789
*&quot;Die Söhne des Thals&quot;, 1803-1804, in two parts
*&quot;Die Templer auf Cypern&quot;, 1803
** &quot;The Templars in Cyprus&quot; English
*&quot;Die Kreuzesbrüder&quot;, 1804
**&quot;The Brethren of the Cross&quot;: a dramatic poem English
*&quot;Das Kreuz an der Ostsee&quot;, 1806
*&quot;Die Brautnacht&quot;, 1806
*&quot;Martin Luther oder die Weihe der Kraft&quot;, 1806
*&quot;Der vierundzwanzigste Februar&quot;, 1808 (translated into French by Jules Lacroix, Paris, 1849)
*&quot;Attila, König der Hunnen, romantische Tragödie&quot;, 1809
*&quot;Wanda&quot;, 1810
*&quot;Die Weihe der Unkraft&quot;, 1813, a recantation of his earlier work &quot;Martin Luther&quot;
*&quot;Kunigunde die Heilige&quot;, 1815
*&quot;Geistliche Übungen für drei Tage&quot;, 1818
*&quot;Die Mutter der Makkabäer&quot;, 1820

&quot;Zacharias Werner&#x27;s Theater&quot;, a collection (without the author&#x27;s consent) of Werner&#x27;s work in 6 volumes, appeared in 1816-1818. &quot;Ausgewählte Schriften&quot; (Selected writings with a biography by K. J. Schütz) in 15 volumes appeared 1840-1841.

<text>Cannon Street is a road in the City of London, the historic nucleus of London and its modern financial centre. It runs roughly parallel with the River Thames, about north of it, in the north of the City.

It is the site of the ancient London Stone and gave its name to Cannon Street station, a mainline railway terminus and connected London Underground station.

==Etymology==
The area around Cannon Street was initially the place of residence of the candle-makers. The name first appears as &quot;Candelwrichstrete&quot; (i.e. &quot;Candlewright Street&quot;) in 1190. The name was shortened over 60 times as a result of the local cockney dialect and settled on Cannon Street in the 17th century, and is therefore not related to the firearms. The ward of Candlewick is named after the street.

A Cannon Street in Birmingham, according to the archives of Birmingham Central Library, is named after the London street.

Candleriggs, a street in Glasgow, has a name of the same origin and meaning.

==Overview==
In the west, Cannon Street starts at St Paul&#x27;s Churchyard outside St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral; running east it meets Queen Victoria Street near Mansion House Underground station, passing Cannon Street station, and finally meets King William Street and Gracechurch Street near Monument tube station. 
In the late 19th century Cannon Street was occupied by large wholesale warehouses, especially of cotton goods and other fabrics.

London Stone, a historic landmark of uncertain origin, was originally situated in the middle of Cannon Street, opposite St Swithin&#x27;s Church. It was later set into the wall of the church, and now rests in a Portland stone casing on the north side of the street, opposite Cannon Street station.

The Roman &quot;praetorium&quot;, or &quot;governor&#x27;s palace&quot;, may also have been located in this area, between the principal street of Roman Londinium and the River Thames. The remains of a very large high status building were found with a garden, water pools and several large halls, some of them decorated with mosaic floors. The plan of the building is only partly preserved, but was erected in the second part of the 1st century and was in use until around 300, rebuilt and renovated several times.

Singer Marc Almond suffered a near-fatal crash in this street in 2004, whilst riding pillion on a motorcycle.

Where Queen Street crosses Cannon Street there is a pedestrian-priority &quot;Central Plaza&quot; area. This was part of an award-winning public realm improvement scheme undertaken in 2006.

Cannon Street formed part of the marathon course of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Cannon Street has eight pubs (as of 2012) in and around the area which is one of the largest concentrations in the City of London.

Cannon Street also appeared in scene VI of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;.

==Transport links==

Cannon Street station is served by the District and Circle lines on the London Underground and also by Southeastern mainline rail services. The street is also the location of Mansion House tube station, also on the District and Circle lines, and of one of the entrances to Bank station, on the Central, Northern and Waterloo &amp; City lines and the Docklands Light Railway.

London Buses routes 15, 17, 521 and night routes N15 and N199 serve Cannon Street.

<text>Gracechurch Street is a main road in the City of London, the historic and financial centre of London, England, which is designated the A1213.
It is home to a number of shops, restaurants, and offices and has an entrance to Leadenhall Market, a covered market dating from the 14th century.

== Overview ==
At its southern end, the street begins near Christopher Wren&#x27;s Monument to the Great Fire of London, at a junction with King William Street, Eastcheap and Cannon Street. Heading north, it crosses Lombard Street and Fenchurch Street, and continues forward into Bishopsgate, which marks the start of the A10 route to King&#x27;s Lynn.

Leadenhall Market, a covered market dating from the 14th century and a Grade II* listed structure since 1972, is the street&#x27;s most famous attraction.

The closest mainline railway station is Fenchurch Street and the nearest London Underground station is Monument. The postcode for the street is EC3V.

== History ==
The word &#x27;Gracechurch&#x27; derives from &quot;Garscherchestrete&quot;, &quot;Gres-cherch&quot; and &quot;Gras-cherche&quot;, with &#x27;Gracechurch&#x27; not used until after the destruction of the street in the Great Fire of London in 1666. The street is in the heart of Roman &quot;Londinium&quot;; it runs directly over the site of the basilica and forum. Some of the former has been unearthed in 2025 as part of work to remodel an office block (which will now be redesigned to accommodate the preservation of the ruins).

In medieval times a corn market was held by St Benet Gracechurch (a church destroyed in the Great Fire) at the junction with Lombard Street, with vendors directed to sell their wares there. The existence of such markets can be seen from the derivation of their names, &quot;gaers&quot; or &quot;gers&quot; meaning a blade of grass or herb and &quot;faenum&quot; meaning hay.

The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) once had a meeting house on Gracechurch Street. William Penn was arrested on 14 August 1670 for delivering a sermon in the street in front of the building after having been forbidden to preach indoors. It was burnt down in 1821 but later rebuilt. Many of its members had already moved to Stoke Newington, a couple of miles north along more or less the same street. The world&#x27;s first school bus was set up to run between Newington Academy for Girls, a Quaker school set up there in 1824, and Gracechurch Street Meeting House. For a time it &quot;became one of the most important Quaker Meetings, and the neighbourhood around it became the centre of the Quaker business community in the city. By the 18th century 20-25% of the immediate population were Quakers. City Friends mingled piety with prosperity and earned reputations as sober, honest tradesmen.&quot;

During its long history, the street was for a period named Gracious Street.

Gracechurch Street formed part of the marathon course of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The women&#x27;s Olympic marathon took place on 5 August 2012 and the men&#x27;s on 12 August. The Paralympic marathons were held on 9 September.

== Cultural impact ==
Gracechurch Street is mentioned in Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; as being the home of Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, the uncle and aunt of the five Bennet sisters. The former Swan-with-Two-Necks inn is the scene of Estella&#x27;s meeting with Pip in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Great Expectations&quot;.

The street has lent its name to the Gracechurch Shopping Centre in Sutton Coldfield, which was named after the street by the property company based in Gracechurch Street responsible for its creation.

<text>Eastcheap is a street in central London that is a western continuation of Great Tower Street towards Monument junction. Its name derives from &quot;cheap&quot;, the Old English word for market, with the prefix &#x27;East&#x27; distinguishing it from Westcheap, another former market street that today is called Cheapside.

In medieval times, Eastcheap was the main meat market in the City of London, with butchers&#x27; stalls lining both sides of the street. It is also notable as the former location of Falstaff&#x27;s Boar&#x27;s Head Inn, featured in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; and &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;.

==History==

The history of Eastcheap dates back to Anglo-Saxon times. The name is first attested on an Anglo-Saxon penny of King Harold I (reigned 1035–1040) that was minted in London by the moneyer Eadwold between 1035 and 1037. The mint signature on the coin reads &quot;EADǷOLD ONESTCEPLV&quot; which is interpreted as &quot;Eadwold on Estcep Lu[ndene]&quot;, meaning &quot;Eadwold, on East Cheap, London&quot;. It is believed that this is the earliest known instance of a street-name on Anglo-Saxon coinage.

At its western end, the modern Eastcheap begins at Monument junction where Gracechurch Street, Cannon Street, and King William Street converge by Monument tube station. It continues eastward into Great Tower Street. It lies within the City ward of Bridge.

The street formerly extended further to the west, where it was called Great Eastcheap, but this section was eliminated when King William Street was built to provide new access to London Bridge in the early 19th century. Falstaff&#x27;s famed tavern, which stood on the Great Eastcheap section of the road, was demolished at this time. The old eastern portion and what is today&#x27;s Eastcheap, was known as Little Eastcheap.

The erased western portion of Eastcheap is recalled in the name of the church of St. Clement Eastcheap, which, despite its name, is to the north of King William Street and to the west of present-day Eastcheap.

Eastcheap formed part of the marathon course of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The women&#x27;s Olympic marathon took place on 5 August and the men&#x27;s on 12 August. The Paralympic marathons were held on 9 September.

==Notable structures==
On Eastcheap&#x27;s north side is St. Margaret Pattens&#x27; church at the corner with Rood Lane. All Hallows-by-the-Tower is visible looking east down Eastcheap and Great Tower Street. On the south side, in the side-road Lovat Lane, is St. Mary-at-Hill. Also on the south side is Botolph Lane, where a Christopher Wren church, St. George, Botolph Lane, stood until it was demolished in 1904. West of Botolph Lane is Pudding Lane, where the Great Fire of London was started.

At 16 Eastcheap is the Monument branch of Citibank; this was the site of St. Andrew Hubbard church, where the economist Thomas Mun was baptised, but the structure was later destroyed by the Great Fire. It was replaced by the King&#x27;s Weigh House where foreign merchants were required to weigh their goods, although the law was not strictly enforced. In 1695 it became a chapel for dissenters. In 1834 they moved to larger premises in Fish Street Hill, at the western end of Eastcheap, now occupied by an exit of the modern Monument tube station. In 1891, Alfred Waterhouse built another Weigh House church, on Duke Street. The building was deemed so magnificent that nearby Robert Street was renamed Weighhouse Street in its honour. During excavation of the site the foundations had stones that had the character of Roman workmanship, and Samian pottery was discovered.

On the Philpot Lane side of the corner between Jamies at 23 Eastcheap and Cafe Nero at 13 Philpot Lane in EC3 is one of London&#x27;s smallest statues, known as the &quot;Philpot Lane Mice&quot;, the &quot;Two Mice Eating Cheese&quot;, or &quot;Mice and shells&quot;, of two mice fighting over either a piece of cheese (or perhaps two shells). The statue&#x27;s exact origin is unclear, but the primary theory is that there were two construction workers working on either the Monument to the Great Fire of London, about 400 ft away, completed in 1677, or 23 Eastcheap itself, the office of spice merchants Hunt and Crombie, architected by John Young and Son, and constructed by Piper and Wheeler, completed in 1862, were sitting on a rail high up on the scaffolding eating lunch; one of them noticed that their cheese sandwich was mostly eaten, and blamed the other, who denied the allegation, so they got into a fight, and either they slipped or the rail broke, and both fell to their deaths. Other workers later figured out that some mice had stolen the sandwich, and decided to make the statue to commemorate the tragedy. Two more theories are that a nearby merchant was paid a fortune by an Asian king to bring Richard Whittington&#x27;s cat to chase away mice, or that a young worker was fired without getting paid, and decided to get revenge by sneaking in and symbolizing his former bosses as rats. Another theory is that it was where the Black Death (which was carried by rats/mice) was first discovered. Another theory is that it is the builder&#x27;s emblem, as there were previously other buildings in the City of London with mouse carvings.

The building at 33-35 Eastcheap is a notable example of Victorian Gothic architecture.

<text>Ivan Fyodorov (; died ) was a Russian navigator and commanding officer of the expedition to northern Alaska in 1732.

After the First Kamchatka expedition of Vitus Bering, Russian exploration efforts were continued by Bering&#x27;s lieutenant Martin Spanberg and the navigator Fyodorov. In 1732, with participants of the First Kamchatka expedition, land-surveyor Mikhail Gvozdev, and the navigator K. Moshkov, Fyodorov sailed to Dezhnev Cape, the easternmost point of Asia, in the &quot;St. Gabriel&quot; (, &quot;Sviatoi Gavriil&quot;). From there, after having replenished the water supply on 5 August, they sailed east and soon came near the mainland at the Cape Prince of Wales. They charted the northwestern coast of Alaska and mapped their route. By doing this, Fyodorov and Gvozdev completed the discovery of the Bering Strait, once started by Semyon Dezhnyov and Fedot Alekseyev and continued by Bering. Their expedition also discovered three previously unknown islands.

<text>Q*bert () is a 1982 action video game developed and published by Gottlieb for arcades. It is a 2D action game with puzzle elements that uses isometric graphics to create a pseudo-3D effect. The objective of each level in the game is to change every cube in a pyramid to a target color by making Q*bert, the on-screen character, hop on top of the cube while avoiding obstacles and enemies. Players use a joystick to control the character.

The game was conceived by Warren Davis and Jeff Lee. Lee designed the title character and original concept, which was further developed and implemented by Davis. &quot;Q*bert&quot; was developed under the project name &quot;Cubes&quot;.

&quot;Q*bert&quot; was well-received in arcades and among critics. The game was Gottlieb&#x27;s most successful video game and is among the most recognized brands from the golden age of arcade games. It has been ported to numerous platforms. The game&#x27;s success resulted in sequels and the use of the character&#x27;s likeness in merchandising, such as appearances on lunch boxes, toys, and an animated television show. The Q*bert character became known for his &quot;swearing&quot; and &quot;Q*bertese sound&quot; – an incoherent phrase made of synthesized speech generated by the sound chip and a speech balloon containing a grawlix that appears when he collides with an enemy.

Because the game was developed during the period when Columbia Pictures owned Gottlieb, the intellectual rights to &quot;Q*bert&quot; remained with Columbia, even after they divested themselves of Gottlieb&#x27;s assets in 1984. Therefore, the rights have been owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment since its parent, Sony, acquired Columbia in 1989. Q*bert appeared in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot; franchise, under license from Sony, and later appeared in the film &quot;Pixels&quot;.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Q*bert&quot; is an action game with puzzle elements played from an axonometric third-person perspective to convey a three-dimensional look. The game is played using a single, diagonally mounted four-way joystick. The player controls Q*bert, who starts each game at the top of a pyramid made of 28 cubes, and moves by hopping diagonally from cube to cube. Landing on a cube causes it to change color, and changing every cube to the target color allows the player to progress to the next stage.

At the beginning, jumping on every cube once is enough to advance. In later stages, each cube must be hit twice to reach the target color. Other times, cubes change color every time Q*bert lands on them, instead of remaining on the target color once they reach it. Both elements are then combined in subsequent stages. Jumping off the pyramid results in the character&#x27;s death.

The player is impeded by several enemies, introduced gradually to the game:
* Coily – Coily first appears as a purple egg that bounces to the bottom of the pyramid and then transforms into a snake that chases Q*bert. He is often considered the main antagonist and Q*bert&#x27;s arch-nemesis. Q*bert will die if he collides with Coily.
* Ugg and Wrongway – Two purple creatures that hop along the sides of the cubes in an Escheresque manner. Starting at either the bottom left or bottom right corner, they keep moving toward the top right or top left side of the pyramid respectively and fall off the pyramid when they reach the end. Both are dangerous. Q*bert will also die if he collides with them.
* Slick and Sam – Two green creatures that descend down the pyramid and revert cubes whose color has already been changed. They do not hurt Q*bert, but are annoying, as they change the color of the cube to the original or former color, making the pyramid of cubes harder to solve for Q*bert.

Contact with purple enemies results in a life lost, whereas the green ones are removed from the board upon contact. Colored balls occasionally appear at the second row of cubes and bounce downward; contact with a red ball also results in a life lost, while contact with a green one immobilizes the on-screen enemies for a limited time. Multicolored floating discs on either side of the pyramid serve as an escape from danger, particularly Coily. When Q*bert jumps on a disc, it transports him to the top of the pyramid. If Coily is in close pursuit of the character, he will jump after Q*bert and fall to his death, awarding bonus points. This causes all enemies and balls on the screen to disappear, though they start to return after a few seconds.

Points are awarded for each color change (15 or 25), defeating Coily with a flying disc (500), remaining discs at the end of a stage (at higher stages, 50 or 100) and catching green balls (100) or Slick and Sam (300 each). Bonus points are also awarded for completing a screen, starting at 1,000 points on the first screen of Level 1 and increasing by 250 on each subsequent completion, up to 5,000 after Level 4. Extra lives are granted for reaching certain scores, which are set by the machine operator.

==Development==
===Concept===
Programmer Warren Davis wrote that he was inspired by a pattern of hexagons implemented by fellow Gottlieb developer and &quot;Mad Planets&quot; designer Kan Yabumoto.

In a different telling, the initial concept began when artist Jeff Lee drew a pyramid of cubes inspired by M. C. Escher. Lee believed a game could be derived from the artwork, and created an orange, armless main character. The character jumped along the cubes and shot projectiles, called &quot;mucus bombs&quot;, from a tubular nose at enemies. Enemies included a blue creature, later changed purple and named Wrong Way, and an orange creature, later changed green and named Sam. Lee had drawn similar characters since childhood, inspired by characters from comics, cartoons, &quot;Mad&quot; magazine and by artist Ed &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Roth. Q*bert&#x27;s design later included a speech balloon with , &quot;&quot;, which Lee originally presented as a joke.

===Implementation===
Warren Davis, who was hired to work on the game &quot;Protector&quot;, noticed Lee&#x27;s ideas and asked if he could use them to practice programming randomness and gravity as game mechanics. Thus, he added balls that bounce from the pyramid&#x27;s top to bottom. Because Davis was still learning how to program game mechanics, he wanted to keep the design simple. He also believed games with complex control schemes were frustrating and wanted something that could be played with one hand. To accomplish this, Davis removed the shooting and changed the objective of saving the protagonist from danger. As Davis worked on the game one night, Gottlieb&#x27;s vice president of engineering, Ron Waxman, noticed him and suggested to change the color of the cubes after the game&#x27;s character has landed on them. Davis implemented a unique control scheme; a four-way joystick was rotated 45° to match the directions of Q*bert&#x27;s jumping. Staff members at Gottlieb urged for a more conventional orientation, but Davis stuck to his decision. Davis remembered to have started programming in April 1982, but the project was only put on the schedule as an actual product several months later.

===Audio===
A MOS Technology 6502 chip that operates at 894 kHz generates the sound effects, and a speech synthesizer by Votrax generates Q*bert&#x27;s incoherent expressions. The audio system uses 128 B of RAM and 4 KB of EPROM to store the sound data and code to implement it. Like other Gottlieb games, the sound system was thoroughly tested to ensure it would handle daily usage. In retrospect, audio engineer David Thiel commented that such testing minimized time available for creative designing.

Thiel was tasked with using the synthesizer to produce English phrases for the game. However, he was unable to create coherent phrases and eventually chose to string together random phonemes instead. Thiel also believed the incoherent speech was a good fit for the &quot;&quot; in Q*bert&#x27;s speech balloon. Following a suggestion from technician Rick Tighe, a pinball machine component known as a ‘knocker’ was included to make a loud sound when a character falls off the pyramid. This knocker consists of a solenoid with a plunger that strikes the mounting bracket (which in turn is firmly fastened to the cabinet). Foam padding was added to the area of contact on the bracket; the developers decided the softer sound better matched a fall rather than a loud knocking sound. The cost of installing foam, however, was too expensive and the padding was omitted.

===Title===
The Gottlieb staff had difficulty naming the game. Aside from the project name &quot;Cubes&quot;, it was untitled for most of the development process. The staff agreed the game should be named after the main character, but disagreed on the name. Lee&#x27;s title for the initial concept—&quot;Snots And Boogers&quot;—was rejected, as was a list of suggestions compiled from company employees. According to Davis, vice president of marketing Howie Rubin championed &#x27; as the title. Although staff members argued it was silly and would be impossible to pronounce, a few early test models were produced with &#x27; as the title on the units&#x27; artwork. During a meeting, &quot;Hubert&quot; was suggested, and a staff member thought of combining &quot;Cubes&quot; and &quot;Hubert&quot; into &quot;Cubert&quot;. Art director Richard Tracy changed the name to &quot;Q-bert&quot;, and the hyphen was later changed to an asterisk. In retrospect, Davis expressed regret for the asterisk, because it prevented the name from becoming a common crossword term and it is a wildcard character for search engines.

===Testing===
As development neared the production stage, &quot;Q*bert&quot; underwent location tests in local arcades under its preliminary title &#x27;, before being widely distributed. According to Jeff Lee, his oldest written record attesting to the game being playable as &#x27; in a public location, a Brunswick bowling alley, dates back to September 11, 1982. Gottlieb also conducted focus groups, in which the designers observed players through a one-way mirror. The control scheme received a mixed reaction during playtesting; some players adapted quickly while others found it frustrating. Initially, Davis was worried players would not adjust to the different controls; some players would unintentionally jump off the pyramid several times, reaching a game over in about ten seconds. Players, however, became accustomed to the controls after playing several rounds of the game. The different responses to the controls prompted Davis to reduce the game&#x27;s level of difficulty, a decision that he would later regret.

===Release===
&quot;Q*bert&quot; is Gottlieb&#x27;s fourth video game. A copyright claim registered with the United States Copyright Office by Gottlieb on February 10, 1983 cites the date of publication of &quot;Q*bert&quot; as October 18, 1982. &quot;Video Games&quot; reported that the game was sold directly to arcade operators at its public showing at the AMOA show held November 18–20, 1982. Gottlieb offered the machines for $2600 per unit.

&quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine listed the mass-market US release date as December 1982. The game was distributed in Japan by Konami and Sega in March 1983. It was also released in Europe in March 1983.

==Reception==
&quot;Q*bert&quot; is Gottlieb&#x27;s only video game that earned considerable critical and commercial success, selling around 25,000 arcade cabinets. In the United States, it was among the thirteen highest-grossing arcade games of 1983. Cabaret and cocktail versions of the game were later produced. The machines have since become collector&#x27;s items; the rarest of them are the cocktail versions.

When the game was first introduced to a wider industry audience at the November 1982 AMOA show, it was immediately received favorably by the press. &quot;Video Games&quot; magazine placed &quot;Q*bert&quot; first in its list of Top Ten Hits, describing it as &quot;the most unusual and exciting game of the show&quot; and stating that &quot;no operator dared to walk away without buying at least one&quot;. &quot;The Coin Slot&quot; reported &quot;Gottlieb&#x27;s game, Q*BERT, was one of the stars of the show&quot;, and predicted that &quot;The game should do very well&quot;.

Contemporaneous reviews were equally enthusiastic, and focused on the uniqueness of the gameplay and audiovisual presentation. Roger C. Sharpe of &quot;Electronic Games&quot; considered it &quot;a potential Arcade Award winner for coin-op game of the year&quot;, praising innovative gameplay and outstanding graphics. William Brohaugh of &quot;Creative Computing Video &amp; Arcade Games&quot; described the game as an &quot;all-round winner&quot; that had many strong points. He praised the variety of sound effects and the graphics, calling the colors vibrant. Brohaugh lauded &quot;Q*bert&quot;″s inventiveness and appeal, stating that the objective was interesting and unique. Michael Blanchet of &quot;Electronic Fun&quot; suggested the game might push &quot;Pac-Man&quot; out of the spotlight in 1983. Neil Tesser of &quot;Video Games&quot; also likened &quot;Q*bert&quot; to games released in the early 1980s in Japan, like &quot;Pac-Man&quot; and &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, due to the focus on characters, animation and story lines, as well as the &quot;absence of violence&quot;. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine praised the game&#x27;s graphics and colors.

&quot;Electronic Games&quot; awarded &quot;Q*bert&quot; &quot;Most Innovative Coin-op Game&quot; of the year. &quot;Video Games Player&quot; called it the &quot;Funniest Game of the Year&quot; among arcade games in 1983.

&quot;Q*bert&quot; continues to be recognized as a significant part of video game history. Author Steven Kent and GameSpy&#x27;s William Cassidy considered &quot;Q*bert&quot; one of the more memorable games of its time. Author David Ellis echoed similar statements, calling it a &quot;classic favorite&quot;. 1UP.com&#x27;s Jeremy Parish and Kim Wild of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; magazine described the game as difficult yet addictive. Author John Sellers also called &quot;Q*bert&quot; addictive, and praised the sound effects and three-dimensional appearance of the graphics. Cassidy called the game unique and challenging; he attributed the challenge in part to the control scheme. IGN&#x27;s Jeremy Dunham believed the controls were poorly designed, describing them as &quot;unresponsive&quot; and &quot;a struggle&quot;. He nonetheless considered the game addictive.

&quot;Edge&quot; magazine attributed the success of the game to the title character. They stated that players could easily relate to Q*bert, particularly because he swore. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;, however, considered the swearing a negative but the character appealing. Cassidy believed the game&#x27;s appeal lay in the main character. He described Q*bert as cute and having a personality that made him stand out in comparison to other popular video game characters. The authors of &quot;High Score!&quot; referred to Q*bert as &quot;ultra-endearing alien hopmeister&quot;, and the cutest game character of 1982.

==Ports==
At the 1982 AMOA Show, Parker Brothers secured the license to publish home conversions of the &quot;Q*bert&quot; arcade game. Parker Brothers first published a port to the Atari 2600, and by the end of 1983, the company also advertised versions for Atari 5200, Intellivision, ColecoVision, Atari 8-bit computers, VIC-20, TI-99/4A, and Commodore 64. The release of the Commodore 64 version was noted to lag behind the others but appeared in 1984. Parker Brothers also translated the game into a standalone tabletop electronic game. It uses a VFD screen and has since become a rare collector&#x27;s item. &quot;Q*bert&quot; was also published by Parker Brothers for the Philips Videopac in Europe, by Tsukuda Original for the Othello Multivision in Japan, and by Ultra Games for the NES in North America.

The initial home port for the Atari 2600, the most widespread system at the time, was met with mixed reactions. &quot;Video Games&quot; warned that buyers of the Atari 2600 version &quot;may find themselves just a little disappointed.&quot; They criticized the lack of music, the removal of the characters Ugg and Wrongway, and the system&#x27;s troubles handling the character sprites at a steady performance. Later, Mark Brownstein of the same magazine was more in favor of the game, but still cited the presence of fewer cubes in the game&#x27;s pyramidal layout and &quot;pretty poor control&quot; as negatives. Will Richardson of &quot;Electronic Games&quot; noted a lack in audiovisual qualities and counter-intuitive controls, but commended the gameplay, stating that the game &quot;comes much closer to its source of inspiration than a surface evaluation indicates.&quot; Randi Hacker of &quot;Electronic Fun with Computers &amp; Games&quot; called it a &quot;sterling adaption&quot; &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; scored the Atari VCS version 70% in 1989. In 2008, IGN&#x27;s Levi Buchanan rated it the fourth-worst arcade port for the Atari 2600, mostly because of a lack of jumping animations for enemies, which instead appear instantly on the adjacent cube, making it impossible to know in which direction they are traveling before they land. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called &quot;Q*Bert&quot; one of the top ten games for the Atari 2600 in 2013, saying the port &quot;lost the cool isometric perspective but none of the addictive gameplay.&quot;

Other home versions were well-received, with some exceptions. Of the ColecoVision version, &quot;Electronic Fun with Computers &amp; Games&quot; noted that &quot;&quot;Q*bert&quot; aficionados will not be disappointed.&quot; Brownstein called it one of the best of the authorized versions. Warren Davis also considered the ColecoVision version the most accurate port of the arcade. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; gave the ColecoVision version a 72% score. Brownstein judged the Atari 5200 version inferior to that for the ColecoVision because of the imprecision of the Atari 5200 controller, but noted that &quot;it does tend to grow on you.&quot; &quot;Video Games&quot; identified the Intellivision version as the worst of the available ports, criticizing the system&#x27;s controller as inadequate for the game. &quot;Antic&quot; magazine&#x27;s David Duberman called the Atari 8-bit version &quot;one of the finest translations of an arcade game for the home computer format&quot;, and Arthur Leyenberger of &quot;Creative Computing&quot; listed it as a runner-up for Best Arcade Adaptation to the system, praising its faithful graphics, sound, movement and playability. &quot;Softline&quot; was more critical, criticizing the Atari version&#x27;s controls and lack of swearing. The magazine concluded that &quot;the home computer game doesn&#x27;t have the sense of style of the one in the arcades ... the execution just isn&#x27;t there.&quot; In 1984, the magazine&#x27;s readers named the game the fifth-worst Atari program of 1983. &quot;Computer Games&quot; called the C64 version an &quot;absolutely terrific translation&quot; that &quot;almost totally duplicates the arcade game,&quot; aside from its lack of synthesized speech. The standalone tabletop was awarded Stand-Alone Game of the Year in &quot;Electronic Games&quot;. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; reviewed the NES version in 1989, with four critics scoring it 7, 3, 4 and 4 out of 10.

In 2003, a version for Java-based mobile phones was announced by Sony Pictures Mobile. Reviewers generally acknowledged it as a faithful port of the arcade original, but criticized the controls. &quot;Modojo&quot;&#x27;s Robert Falcon stated that the diagonal controls take time to adapt to on a cell phone with traditional directions. Michael French of &quot;Pocket Gamer&quot; concluded: &quot;You can&#x27;t escape the fact it doesn&#x27;t exactly fit on mobile. The graphics certainly do, and the spruced-up sound effects are timeless ... but really, it&#x27;s a little too perfect a conversion.&quot; &quot;Airgamer&quot; criticized the gameplay as monotonous and the difficulty as frustrating. By contrast, &quot;Wireless Gaming Review&quot; called it &quot;one of the best of mobile&#x27;s retro roundup.&quot;

On February 22, 2007, &quot;Q*bert&quot; was released on the PlayStation 3&#x27;s PlayStation Network by fellow Sony subsidiary Sony Online Entertainment. It features upscaled and filtered graphics, an online leaderboard for players to post high scores, and Sixaxis motion controls. The game received a mixed reception. &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Jeremy Dunham and &quot;GameSpot&quot;&#x27;s Jeff Gerstmann did not enjoy the motion controls and said that the game was a title only for nostalgic players. Eurogamer.net&#x27;s Richard Leadbetter judged the game&#x27;s elements &quot;too simplistic and repetitive to make them worthwhile in 2007.&quot; In contrast, 1UP.com&#x27;s Jeremy Parish considered the title worth purchasing, citing its addictive gameplay.

==Legacy==
According to Jeremy Parish, &quot;Q*bert&quot; is &quot;one of the higher-profile titles of the classic era&quot;. In describing &quot;Q*bert&quot;″s legacy, Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot referred to the game as a &quot;rare arcade success&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; ranked it behind 16 other arcade games in terms of their technical, creative and cultural impact. Though successful, the creators of the game did not receive royalties, as Gottlieb had no such program in place at the time. Davis and Lee nonetheless expressed pride about the game continuing to be remembered fondly.

===Market impact===
&quot;Q*bert&quot; became one of the most merchandised arcade games behind &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, although according to John Sellers it was not nearly as successful as that franchise or &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. The character&#x27;s likeness appears on various items including coloring books, sleeping bags, frisbees, board games, wind-up toys, and stuffed animals. In a flyer distributed in 1983, Gottlieb claimed over 125 licensed products. However, the video game crash of 1983 depressed the market, and the game&#x27;s popularity began to decline by 1984.

In the years following its release, &quot;Q*bert&quot; inspired many other games with similar concepts. The magazines &quot;Video Games&quot; and &quot;Computer Games&quot; both commented on the trend with features about &quot;Q*bert&quot;-like games in 1984. They listed &quot;Mr. Cool&quot; by Sierra On-Line, &quot;Frostbite&quot; by Activision, &quot;Q-Bopper&quot; by Accelerated Software, &quot;Juice&quot; by Tronix, &quot;Quick Step&quot; by Imagic, &quot;Flip &amp; Flop&quot; and &quot;Boing&quot; by First Star Software, &quot;Pharaoh&#x27;s Pyramid&quot; by Master Control Software, &quot;Pogo Joe&quot; by Screenplay, &quot;Rabbit Transit&quot; by Starpath, as games which had been inspired by &quot;Q*bert&quot;. Further titles that have been identified as &quot;Q*bert&quot;-like games include &quot;Cubit&quot; by Micromax, &quot;J-bird&quot; by Orion Software, and in the UK &quot;Bouncer&quot; by Acornsoft, &quot;Hubert&quot; by Blaby Computer Games, &quot;Pogo&quot; by Ocean, &quot;Spellbound&quot; by Beyond, &quot;Vector Hopper&quot; by Kristof Tuts, and &quot;Hoppy Hop&quot; by Josyan.

===In other media===
In 1983, &quot;Q*bert&quot; was adapted into an animated cartoon as part of &quot;Saturday Supercade&quot; on CBS, which features segments based on video game characters from the golden age of video arcade games. &quot;Saturday Supercade&quot; was produced by Ruby-Spears Productions, the &quot;Q*bert&quot; segments between 1983 and 1984. The show is set in a United States, 1950s era town called &quot;Q-Burg&quot;, and stars Q*bert as a high school student, altered to include arms, hands, jacket, and sneakers. He shoots black projectiles from his nose, what he calls &quot;Slippy Dew&quot;, to make his enemies slip. Characters frequently say puns that add the letter &quot;Q&quot; to words.
Gottlieb released the pinball game &quot;Q*bert″s Quest&quot; in 1983. It has two pairs of flippers in an &quot;X&quot; formation and uses audio from the arcade game. Gottlieb produced fewer than 900 units, but in Japan &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Q*bert&#x27;s Quest&quot; in their June 1, 1983 issue as being the second most-successful flipper unit of the year.

&quot;Q*bert&quot; is seen being played in the 1984 film &quot;Moscow on the Hudson&quot; starring Robin Williams.

The 1993 IBM PC role-playing game &quot;Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds&quot; has a segment where the player has to solve a pyramid puzzle as a homage to &quot;Q*bert&quot;. In the 2009 action-adventure game &quot;&quot;, a &quot;Q*bert&quot; arcade cabinet can be seen in the Ghostbusters headquarters.

&quot;Q*bert&quot; characters appear in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot; franchise.

Q*bert appears in the 2015 film &quot;Pixels&quot; as a supporting character, the film having produced by copyright owner Sony.

In 2014, Q*bert makes a cameo appearance in the RadioShack Super Bowl XLVIII commercial &quot;The &#x27;80s Called&quot;.

The game has been referenced in several animated television series: &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, &quot;Mad&quot;, and &quot;South Park&quot;.

===High scores===
On November 28, 1983, Rob Gerhardt reached a record score of 33,273,520 points in a &quot;Q*bert&quot; marathon. He held it for almost 30 years, until George Leutz from Brooklyn, New York played one game of &quot;Q*bert&quot; for eighty-four hours and forty-eight minutes on February 14–18, 2013 at Richie Knucklez&#x27; Arcade in Flemington, New Jersey. He scored 37,163,080 points.

Doris Self, credited by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the &quot;oldest competitive female gamer&quot;, set the tournament record score of 1,112,300 for &quot;Q*bert&quot; in 1984 at the age of 58. Her record was surpassed by Drew Goins on June 27, 1987 with a score of 2,222,220. Self continually attempted to regain the record until her death in 2006.

On November 18, 2012, George Leutz broke the &quot;Q*Bert&quot; tournament world record live at the Kong Off 2 event at The 1up Arcade and Bar in Denver, Colorado. Leutz scored 3,930,990 points in just under eight hours, earning 1.5 million points on his first life, beating Self&#x27;s score using a single life. Leutz&#x27;s score was verified by Twin Galaxies. The video ends at a score of 3.7 million points, 1,500,000 points over the previous record.

===Updates, remakes, and sequels===
====&quot;Faster Harder More Challenging Q*bert&quot;====
Believing that the original game was too easy, Davis initiated development of &quot;Faster Harder More Challenging Q*bert&quot; in 1983, which increases the difficulty, introduces Q*bertha, and adds a bonus round. The project was canceled. Davis released the ROM image onto the web in December 1996.

====&quot;Q*bert&#x27;s Qubes&quot;====
Several video game sequels were released over the years, but did not reach the same level of success as the original. The first, titled &quot;Q*bert&#x27;s Qubes&quot;, shows a copyright for 1983 on its title screen, whereas the instruction manual cites a 1984 copyright. It was manufactured by Mylstar Electronics and uses the same hardware as the original. The game features Q*bert, but introduces new enemies: Meltniks, Shoobops, and Rat-A-Tat-Tat. The player navigates the protagonist around a plane of cubes while avoiding enemies. Jumping on a cube causes it to rotate, changing the color of the visible sides of the cube. The goal is to match a line of cubes to a target sample; later levels require multiple rows to match. Though part of a popular franchise, the game&#x27;s release was hardly noticed. Parker Brothers showcased home versions of &quot;Q*bert&#x27;s Qubes&quot; at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1985. &quot;Q*bert&#x27;s Qubes&quot; was ported to the ColecoVision and Atari 2600. Version for Atari 8-bit computers and the Commodore 64 were referred to in the instructions of the released conversions. The Atari 8-bit version has not yet been found, but Games That Weren&#x27;t tracked down a preview of the C64 version in 2017.

====MSX &quot;Q*bert&quot; (1986)====
Konami, who had distributed the original &quot;Q*bert&quot; to Japanese arcades in 1983, produced a different game, that kept the title &quot;Q*bert&quot;, released in Japan and Europe for MSX computers in 1986. The main character is a little dragon, and the mechanics are based on &quot;Q*bert&#x27;s Qubes&quot;. Each of the 50 stages has a different pattern of cubes. The competitive 2-player mode assigns each side a different pattern, and the players score points either by completing their pattern first or by pushing the other off the board.

====&quot;Q*bert&quot; for Game Boy====
Developed by Realtime Associates and published by Jaleco in 1992, this version has 64 boards in different shapes.

====&quot;Q*bert 3&quot;====
&quot;Q*bert 3&quot; for the Super NES was developed by Realtime Associates and published by NTVIC in 1992. Jeff Lee worked on the graphics. It has gameplay similar to the original, but like the Game Boy game, has larger levels of varying shapes. In addition to enemies from the first game, it introduces Frogg, Top Hat, and Derby.

====&quot;Q*bert&quot; (1999)====
Q*bert is a remake of the 1982 arcade game of the same name with 3D graphics. It was developed by Artech Studios and released by Hasbro Interactive on the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows in 1999 and on the Dreamcast in 2000.

====&quot;Q*bert&quot; (2000) for Game Boy Color====
====&quot;Q*bert 2004&quot;====
In 2004, Sony Pictures released a sequel for Adobe Flash titled &quot;Q*bert 2004&quot;, containing a faithful rendition of the original arcade game, along with 50 levels that use new board layouts and six new visual themes. &quot;Q*Bert Deluxe&quot; for iOS devices was initially released as a rendition of the arcade game, but later received updates with the themes and stages from &quot;Q*Bert 2004&quot;.

====&quot;Q*bert 2005&quot;====
In 2005, Sony Pictures released &quot;Q*bert 2005&quot; as a download for Windows and as a Flash browser applet, featuring 50 different levels.

====&quot;Q*bert Rebooted&quot;====
On July 2, 2014, Gonzo Games and Sideline amusement announced &quot;Q*bert Rebooted&quot; to be released on Steam, iOS and Android. Versions for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita were released on February 17, 2015 in North America and February 18, 2015 in Europe. It was released on February 12, 2016 for the Xbox One. According to Mark Caplan, Vice President, Consumer Products, Worldwide Marketing &amp; Distribution at Sony Pictures Entertainment, the release was motivated by &quot;renewed interest in &quot;Q*bert&quot;, in part due to the cameo in the recent &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot; animated feature film&quot;.

&quot;Q*bert Rebooted&quot; contains a port of the classic arcade game alongside a new playing mode that uses hexagonal shapes, increasing the number of possible movement directions to six. Additionally, the &#x27;Rebooted&#x27; mode features new enemy types, including a boxing glove that punches Q*bert off the levels and a treasure chest that tries to avoid him. The game has 5 different stage designs spread across 40 levels, which contain three rounds and a bonus round and have to be completed with 5 lives. Gems are collected to unlock different skins for the Q*bert character, and completing levels multiple times while reaching specific time and score goals is awarded with stars that enable access to more levels.

====&quot;Q*bert (2019)&quot;====
On October 11, 2019, an updated version of &quot;Q*bert&quot; developed by Lucky-Kat games in association with Sony Pictures was published via the iOS and Android.

<doc id="413515" wikidata="Q4581944" url="?curid=413515" title="Holborn Viaduct">
<text>Holborn Viaduct is a road bridge in London and the name of the street which crosses it (which forms part of the A40 route). It links Holborn, via Holborn Circus, with Newgate Street, in the City of London, England financial district, passing over Farringdon Street and the subterranean River Fleet. The viaduct spans the steep-sided Holborn Hill and the River Fleet valley at a length of and wide. City surveyor William Haywood was the architect and the engineer was Rowland Mason Ordish.

==History==
Holborn Viaduct was built between 1863 and 1869, as a part of the Holborn Valley Improvements, which included a public works scheme which, at a cost of over £2.5 million (over £ in ), improved access into the City from the West End, with better traffic flow and distribution around the new Holborn Circus, the creation of Queen Victoria Street, the rebuilding of Blackfriars Bridge, the opening of the Embankment section into the City, the continuation of Farringdon Street as Farringdon Road and associated railway routes with Farringdon station and Ludgate Hill station. It was opened by Queen Victoria at the same time as the inauguration of the other thoroughfares with a formal coach drive procession on 6 November 1869.

The viaduct crosses the junction of Victoria Street with Farringdon Street, at the point where Oldbourne Bridge had spanned the River Fleet before it was culverted for the creation of Farringdon Street and its market in 1734, thus enabling east-west traffic to avoid the steep gradients of the Holborn/Fleet valley at Holborn Hill and Snow Hill (also Skinner Street from 1829). .

Pedestrian access between the two street levels was effected via four pavilions, at each side and either end, containing staircases for access from the viaduct to Farringdon Street below. The pavilions&#x27; parapets are adorned with figurative statues to represent commerce and agriculture on the south side, both by sculptor Henry Bursill, with science and fine art on the north side, by the sculpture firm Farmer &amp; Brindley; there are also statues of lord mayors William Walworth and Henry Fitz-Ailwin. In 1941 the Blitz raids destroyed and damaged most of the area including the north side pavilions; these were copied and reinstated with associated property developments in 2000 (western) and 2014 (eastern), including lifts.

Holborn Viaduct railway station, opened on 2 March 1874, was at the eastern end with a low-level through route towards Farringdon, and was replaced in 1990 by St. Paul&#x27;s Thameslink railway station (later renamed City Thameslink).

In 1882, 57 Holborn Viaduct, on the north-eastern side, became home to the world&#x27;s first coal-fired power station, the Edison Electric Light Station, operational from 1882 to 1886. The building in which it was housed was destroyed by bombing during the Blitz, and the large building called 60 Holborn Viaduct has since subsumed the site.

<doc id="413521" wikidata="Q1785125" url="?curid=413521" title="Wing, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Wing, known in antiquated times as Wyng, is a village and civil parish in east Buckinghamshire, England. The village is on the main A418 road between Aylesbury and Leighton Buzzard. It is about north-east of Aylesbury, west of Leighton Buzzard, and south of Milton Keynes.

==History==
The Domesday Book of 1086 records the toponym as &quot;Witehunge&quot;. The name occurs in Old English &quot;circa&quot; 966–975 as &quot;Weowungum&quot; (dative plural case). It could mean:

*&quot;Wiwa&#x27;s sons or people&quot;. 
*&quot;The dwellers at, or devotees of, a heathen temple.&quot;
The first syllables of the names of the nearby village of Wingrave and the nearby hamlet of Wingbury have the same etymology. 

The remains of the temple referred to may be under the Anglo-Saxon Church of England parish church of All Saints. The BBC programme &quot;Meet the Ancestors&quot; came to Wing in 2000 and recreated the face of an Anglo-Saxon girl found buried in the old graveyard. Wing claims to have the oldest continuously used religious site in the country, with evidence showing the site has had religious use going back well over 1300 years. The Anglo-Saxon origin of All Saints&#x27; parish church makes it one of the oldest churches in England, though St Paul’s Cathedral in London, for example, was originally dedicated in 604 AD.
An ancient track, part of the pre-historic Icknield Way linking Oxford with Cambridge, once passed through the village. This was used in the Middle Ages and led to an increase in the village&#x27;s size, though with the advent of modern roads and motorways this is less used today. 

As early as the 7th century there was an abbey near the village at Ascott, that had been built by an unknown member of the House of Wessex royal family and given to a Benedictine convent in Angers. The Anglo-Saxon church in Wing, dedicated to All Saints, was also built at about this time for St Birinus, but evidence found in the 15th century during extensive renovations on the church suggest a Roman structure had stood on this site beforehand. It is unusual among religious buildings of this age for the church and abbey to have been built apart, it was normal for them to be constructed within the same complex of buildings. One possible explanation for this is that the church was built on a pre-existing religious site, which the evidence in the village&#x27;s name and in the aforementioned archaeological finds seem to suggest. The church contains a number of fine monuments, including the &quot;purest Renaissance monument of the mid-16th century&quot; to Sir Robert Dormer (died 1552), and a wall monument attributed to Louis-François Roubiliac. 

Nine hundred metres to the NNE of All Saints’ Church at the end of the High Street are the earthwork remains of a late 11th-, early 12th-century Norman motte-and-bailey castle, which is positioned at the top of Castle Hill. The castle likely had an inner and possibly an outer bailey to the East, although this has now all been built over by the road and housing. The remaining mound stands around 16 feet high and covers an area of around 120 feet.Wing Motte and Bailey castle

Wing also features a Pedal Car Racing team called Wing Racers made up of residents and friends that compete at competitions such as the Shenington 24hr.

==Amenities==
The village has two schools. Overstone Combined School is a mixed, foundation primary school for children aged 3–11. Cottesloe School is a secondary school for children aged 11–18.

It also has two public houses, a social club, an Indian restaurant, a Chinese takeaway which doubles as a fish and chip shop, and a police station. A Post Office is located on the High Street.

Ascott House, a home of the Rothschild family, is in the parish. The village hall built in 1905 at a cost of £2000 is in the Rothschild style and is one of the most prominent buildings in the village, and was formally opened by Lord Rothschild.

==World War 2==

During WW2, an RAF base was built close to Wing. Completed in 1941, the primary purpose of RAF Wing was for training Wellington bomber crews. With the base in such close proximity to the village, the sight and sound of aircraft flying over the village became an part of everyday life. The village hall became a popular destination for aircrew and airfield personnel where weekly dances took place. The village pubs were also frequent destinations. At the end of the war RAF Wing served as a gateway for tens of thousands of men returning from duty in Europe. The base closed in April 1956.

==Third London Airport==

In 1971, the Roskill Commission identified the disused RAF Wing as the best site for a four-runway national hub airport, generally known as Cublington Airport. This attracted considerable opposition on environmental and noise nuisance grounds, and the plans were first changed to focus on a coastal site at Maplin Sands in the Thames Estuary and eventually scrapped altogether. As a permanent celebration of the victory, Buckinghamshire County Council planted a spinney of over 400 trees on a 3-acre site that would have been at the centre of the airport. As of 2023, there are no airports in the UK with more than two active paved runways.

==Transport==
Wing is about three miles from Leighton Buzzard railway station, which is served by West Midlands Trains and Southern trains on the West Coast Main Line, travelling to destinations such as Birmingham New Street, Milton Keynes Central and London Euston. Wing is served by buses running services between Aylesbury and Milton Keynes operated by Arriva Shires &amp; Essex and between Leighton Buzzard and Aylesbury operated by Z&amp;S International.

<text>A box (plural: boxes) is a container with rigid sides used for the storage or transportation of its contents. Most boxes have flat, parallel, rectangular sides (typically rectangular prisms). Boxes can be very small (like a matchbox) or very large (like a shipping box for furniture) and can be used for a variety of purposes, from functional to decorative. 

Boxes may be made of a variety of materials, both durable (such as wood and metal) and non-durable (such as corrugated fiberboard and paperboard). Corrugated metal boxes are commonly used as shipping containers.

Boxes may be closed and shut with flaps, doors, or a separate lid. They can be secured shut with adhesives, tapes, string, or more decorative or elaborately functional mechanisms, such as catches, clasps or locks.

== Packaging ==
Several types of boxes are used in packaging and storage.

* A corrugated box is a shipping container made from corrugated fiberboard, most commonly used to transport products from a warehouse during distribution. Corrugated boxes are also known as cartons, cases, and cardboard boxes in various regions. Corrugated boxes are rated based on the strength of their material or their carrying capacity. Corrugated boxes are also used as product packaging, or in point of sale displays. 
* Folding cartons (sometimes known as a box) are paperboard boxes manufactured with a folding lid. These are used to package a wide range of goods, and can be used for either one-time (non-resealable) usage, or as a storage box for more permanent use. Folding cartons are first printed (if necessary) before being die-cut and scored to form a blank; these are then transported and stored flat, before being constructed at the point of use.
** A gift box is a variant on the folding carton, used for birthday or Christmas gifts.
* Gable boxes are paperboard cartons used for liquids. 
* Setup boxes (also known as rigid paperboard boxes) are made of stiff paperboard and are permanently glued together with paper skins that can be printed or colored. Unlike folding cartons, these are assembled at the point of manufacture and transported as already constructed (&quot;set-up&quot;). Set up boxes are more expensive than folding boxes and are typically used for protecting high-value items such as cosmetics, watches or smaller consumer electronics.
* Crates are heavy duty shipping containers. Originally made of wood, crates are distinct from wooden boxes, also used as heavy-duty shipping containers, as a wooden container must have all six of its sides put in place to result in the rated strength of the container. The strength of a wooden box, on the other hand, is rated based on the weight it can carry before the top or opening is installed.
** A wooden wine box or wine crate, originally used for shipping and storing expensive wines, is a variant of the wooden box now used for decorative or promotional purposes, or as a storage box during shipping.
* Bulk boxes are large boxes often used in industrial environments, sized to fit on a pallet.
* An ammunition box is a metal can or box for ammunition.
Depending on locale and usage, the terms carton and box are sometimes used interchangeably. The invention of large steel intermodal shipping containers has helped advance the globalization of commerce.

== Storage ==

Boxes for storing various items in can often be very decorative, as they are intended for permanent use and sometimes are put on display in certain locations.

The following are some types of storage boxes :
* A jewelry (American English) or jewellery (British English) box, is a box for s or jewels. It can take a very modest form with paper covering and lining, covered in leather and lined with satin, or be larger and more highly decorated.
* A hat box is used for storing or transporting a hat. Hat boxes are often cylindrical or oval.
* A humidor is a special box for storing cigars at the proper humidity.
* A &quot;strong box&quot; or safe, is a secure lockable box for storing money or other valuable items. The term &quot;strong box&quot; is sometimes used for safes that are not portable but installed in a wall or floor.
* A toolbox is used for carrying tools of various kinds. They are usually used for portability rather than just storage. 
* A toy box is name of box for storing toys.
* A box file is used in offices for storing papers and smaller files.

<text>Nouméa () is the capital and largest city of the French special collectivity of New Caledonia and is also the largest Francophone city in Oceania. It is situated on a peninsula in the south of New Caledonia&#x27;s main island, Grande Terre, and is home to the majority of the island&#x27;s European, Polynesian (Wallisians, Futunians, Tahitians), Indonesian, and Vietnamese populations, as well as many Melanesians, Ni-Vanuatu and Kanaks who work in one of the South Pacific&#x27;s most industrialised cities. The city lies on a protected deepwater harbour that serves as the chief port for New Caledonia.

At the September 2019 census, there were 182,341 inhabitants in the metropolitan area of Greater Nouméa (), 94,285 of whom lived in the city (commune) of Nouméa proper. 67.2% of the population of New Caledonia lives in Greater Nouméa, which covers the communes of Nouméa, Le Mont-Dore, Dumbéa and Païta.

==History==

The first European to establish a settlement in the vicinity was British trader James Paddon in 1851. Eager to assert control of the island, the French established a settlement nearby three years later in 1854, moving from Balade in the north of the island. This settlement was initially called Port-de-France and was renamed Nouméa in 1866. The area served first as a penal colony, later as a centre for the exportation of the nickel and gold that was mined nearby.

From 1904 to 1940, Nouméa was linked to Dumbéa and Païta by the Nouméa-Païta railway, the only railway line that ever existed in New Caledonia.

During World War II, the United States Navy built Naval Base Noumea and Nouméa served as the headquarters of the United States military in the South Pacific. The five-sided U.S. military headquarters complex was adopted after the war as the base for a new regional intergovernmental development organisation: the South Pacific Commission, later known as the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, and later still as the Pacific Community.

The city maintains much of New Caledonia&#x27;s unique mix of French and old Melanesian culture. Even today the United States wartime military influence lingers, both with the warmth that many New Caledonian people feel towards the United States after experiencing the relative friendliness of American soldiers and also with the names of several of the quarters in Nouméa. Districts such as &quot;Receiving&quot; and &quot;Robinson&quot;, or even &quot;Motor Pool&quot;, strike the anglophone ear strangely, until the historical context becomes clear.

==Geography==
The city is situated on an irregular, hilly peninsula near the southeast end of New Caledonia, which is in the south-west Pacific Ocean.

Neighbourhoods of Nouméa include:
*Rivière-Salée
*6e km, 7e km, Normandie, and Tina
*Ducos peninsula:
**Ducos, Ducos industriel, Kaméré, Koumourou, Logicoop, Numbo, Tindu
*4e Km, Aérodrome, Haut Magenta, Magenta, Ouémo, and Portes de fer
*Faubourg Blanchot and Vallée des Colons
*Doniambo, Montagne coupée, Montravel, and Vallée du tir
*Artillerie Nord, Centre Ville, Nouville, Quartier Latin, Vallée du Génie

Although it is not currently a major tourist destination, Nouméa has experienced a construction boom in the 21st century. The installation of amenities has kept pace and the municipality boasts a public works programme. The mayor of Noumea is Sonia Lagarde; in 2020 her re-election was opposed by the former leader of the Confederation of Small and Medium Enterprises (CPME), Cherifa Linossier, whose unsuccessful campaign was based on local economic revitalisation.

==Transport==
Aircalin, the international airline of New Caledonia, and Air Calédonie (Aircal), the domestic airline, have their headquarters in the city. Aircal&#x27;s headquarters are on the grounds of Nouméa Magenta Airport,
which serves local routes. Nouméa&#x27;s international airport is La Tontouta International Airport, from the city.

The Nouméa-Païta railway, which was the only railway line that ever existed in New Caledonia, was closed in 1940.

==Education==

The University of New Caledonia (UNC) dates to 1987 when the Université française du Pacifique (French University of the Pacific) was created, with two centres, one in French Polynesia and the other in New Caledonia. In 1997 the decision was made to split the two parts into separate universities and so in 1999 the Université de la Nouvelle-Calédonie and the Université de la Polynésie française were formed.

UNC welcomes around 3,000 local and international students and 100 professors and researchers each year.

The &quot;Bibliothèque Bernheim&quot; (Bernheim Library) is located in Nouméa.

The city is home to several museums, including the Maritime Museum of New Caledonia.

<text>Cromwell Road is a major London road in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, designated as part of the A4. It was created in the 19th century and is said to be named after Richard Cromwell, son of Oliver Cromwell, who once owned a house there.

The Security Service (MI5) was based at 35 Cromwell Road from 1929 to 1934.

Cromwell Road was not always the main traffic route it is now, as when it was built, it ended at Earl&#x27;s Court. The Cromwell Road extension, across the West London railway line and towards Hammersmith, was authorised as a bridge across the railway in 1884 but completed only in 1941. Thus, it was only after the Second World War that it became the main A4 route into London. The large traffic increase brought much demolition and road rearrangement beyond Earls Court Road in 1967 to 1972, but the main part of Cromwell Road has not had its basic building line changed.

The Cromwell Road Extension was a mid-late 1950s roadlaying program involving widening and demolition from Hammersmith Broadway to the Great West Road at Chiswick Roundabout as part of the A4 route for Heathrow and the West. The Hammersmith flyover(1961), avoiding Hammersmith Broadway, complemented these works which eventually fed the M4 Motorway (1965) . Some of the streets widened by demolition in Chiswick to form the route have retained their former names. 

The road begins as West Cromwell Road, near West Kensington Underground station, and continues eastwards from Talgarth Road. It becomes Cromwell Road proper as it crosses Earl&#x27;s Court Road. It goes just south of Cromwell Hospital and then past Gloucester Road and Gloucester Road Underground station. The Kensington Forum hotel, designed by Richard Seifert and built in 1971–1972 as Penta hotel, is located across the road from the West London Air Terminal (1957–1974), which is no longer operational, and is situated next to the Gloucester Road station. 

The next major crossroads comes at the intersection with Queen&#x27;s Gate, on the corner of which stands Baden-Powell House, the former headquarters of The Scout Association. The road then passes to the south of a museum-academic complex, informally known as Albertopolis, including the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, Imperial College London and the Victoria and Albert Museum, near South Kensington Underground station. Near this complex, at the junction with Exhibition Road, it becomes Cromwell Gardens for a short stretch before it joins Brompton Road. There are two embassies located on the road: the Embassy of Yemen in London at 57 Cromwell Road, opposite the Natural History Museum, and the Embassy of Venezuela. France also maintain several buildings on the road, including the Consular Section of the French embassy. Ireland maintains a Passport and Visa Section at 114A.

<text>Albertopolis is the nickname given to the area centred on Exhibition Road in London, named after Prince Albert, consort of Queen Victoria. It contains many educational and cultural sites. It lies in the former village of Brompton in Middlesex, renamed as South Kensington, split between the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the City of Westminster (the border running along Imperial College Road), and the area bordered by Cromwell Road to the south and Kensington Road to the north.

==History==
Following the advice of Prince Albert the area was purchased by the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 with the profits made from the Great Exhibition of 1851, which was held in a site in Hyde Park nearby to the north-east. This is commemorated in the name of the principal north–south street laid out on their estate, Exhibition Road.

Prince Albert was a driving force behind the Great Exhibition and President of the Royal Commission, and the name &quot;Albertopolis&quot; seems to have been coined in the 1850s to celebrate and somewhat satirise his role in Victorian cultural life. After his death the term fell into disuse, and the area was more widely referred to as South Kensington. It was revived by architectural historians in the 1960s and popularised by the nascent conservation movement to bring attention to the complex of public Victorian buildings and the surrounding houses built on the Commissioners&#x27; estate, that were threatened with demolition by the expansion and redevelopment plans of Imperial College. Among the buildings threatened was the Imperial Institute, designed by T. E. Collcutt.

==Overview==
There is a central axis between the Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens to the north and the central portal of the south façade of the Natural History Museum. The Royal Albert Hall, Royal College of Music, the former tower of the otherwise-demolished Imperial Institute (now the Queen&#x27;s Tower of Imperial College London) and the 1950s rear extension to the Science Museum are all aligned on this axis, which cannot be seen on the ground. This regular geometric alignment of Albertopolis can be observed readily only from the balconies of the Queen&#x27;s Tower (very rarely open to visitors), although the northern part can be glimpsed from the top floor of the Science Museum.

The closest tube station is South Kensington, linked to the museums by the South Kensington Subway.

On 4 May 1885, the District Railway opened South Kensington Subway, a pedestrian subway (a tiled tunnel), running from the station beneath the length of Exhibition Road, giving sheltered access to the newly built museums for a toll of 1 penny. The subway was originally intended to go as far as the Royal Albert Hall, but the construction of the Imperial Institute meant the tunnel emerged at the Science Museum where it exits onto Exhibition Road. Although it had cost £42,614 to construct (approximately £ today), it was closed on 10 November 1886 and afterwards was opened only occasionally for special museum events. Originally only opened during exhibitions in South Kensington, it was opened to the public free of charge in 1908. The subway is Grade II listed.

There are also three research libraries in the area, the National Art Library, in the Victoria and Albert Museum, Dana Centre, part of the Science Museum, and Imperial College&#x27;s Abdus Salam Library, located on Queen&#x27;s Lawn.

<text>Eklutna (; Dena&#x27;ina: &quot;Idlughet&quot;, ) is a native village within the Municipality of Anchorage in the U.S. state of Alaska. The Tribal Council estimates the population at 70; many tribal members live in the surrounding communities.

==About==
Eklutna lies northeast of Anchorage near the intersection of Mi. 142 of the Alaska Railroad and the Mile 26 of the Glenn Highway from the mouth of the Eklutna River at the head of the Knik Arm of Cook Inlet, at in the Anchorage Recording District.

The Dena&#x27;ina Athabascan village of Eklutna is the last of eight villages that existed before construction of the Alaska Railroad brought an influx of American colonists around 1915. First settled more than 800 years ago, it is the oldest inhabited location in the Anchorage area.
Its Dena&#x27;ina name is &quot;Idlughet&quot; (&quot;by the objects&quot;, referring to two nearby hills); the name &quot;Eklutna&quot; derives from &quot;Idluytnu&quot;, the name for Eklutna River, meaning &quot;(plural) objects river&quot;.

Russian Orthodox missionaries arrived in the 1840s. The melding of Orthodox Christianity and native practices resulted in the brightly colored spirit houses which can be seen at the Eklutna Cemetery, in use since 1650 and now a historical park. The cemetery is probably the most photographed graveyard in Alaska, overshadowing other features of the village.

An Alaska Railroad siding and station house were built near the village Eklutna in 1918. The federal government operated a boarding school for native children near the village before World War II. The U.S. Army established a facility nearby in the mid-20th century; it is now gone.

In 2014, a 160-acre homestead acquired in 1924 was donated to the Native Village of Dena’ina Athabascan country, where Alaska Native people have lived for thousands of years. For the most part, the land has remained untouched — and under a conservation easement, it will be maintained as a refuge for wildlife and protected from real estate development.

Virtually all residents of the Eklutna Village are either Alaska Native or part Native; most are members of the federally recognized Native Village of Eklutna. For employment, most Tribal Members commute to work in Anchorage, nearby Eagle River, or the Matanuska-Susitna Valley.

==Demographics==

Eklutna first appeared on the 1930 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. Of its 158 residents, 61 were Native, 49 were Creole (Mixed Russian &amp; Native), 47 were White, and 1 was Asian. It continued to report on the census until 1970 and was annexed into Anchorage in 1975.

==Education==
Anchorage School District operates area public schools.

<doc id="413542" wikidata="Q60010" url="?curid=413542" title="Kenai Peninsula">
<text>The Kenai Peninsula (Dena&#x27;ina: &quot;Yaghenen&quot;) is a large peninsula jutting from the coast of Southcentral Alaska. The name Kenai (, ) is derived from the word &quot;Kenaitze&quot; or &quot;Kenaitze Indian Tribe&quot;, the name of the Native Athabascan Alaskan tribe, the Kahtnuht’ana Dena’ina (&quot;People along the Kahtnu (Kenai River)&quot;), who historically inhabited the area. They called the Kenai Peninsula &quot;Yaghanen&quot; (&quot;the good land&quot;).

==Geography==

The peninsula extends about southwest from the Chugach Mountains, south of Anchorage. It is separated from the mainland on the west by Cook Inlet and on the east by Prince William Sound. Most of the peninsula is part of the Kenai Peninsula Borough. Athabaskan and Alutiiq Native groups lived on the peninsula for thousands of years prior to colonization during the Russian America era.

The glacier-covered Kenai Mountains run along the southeast spine of the peninsula along the coast of the Gulf of Alaska. Much of the range is within Kenai Fjords National Park. The northwest coast along the Cook Inlet is flatter, dotted with numerous small lakes. Several larger lakes extend through the interior of the peninsula, including Skilak Lake and Tustumena Lake. Rivers include the Kenai River, renowned for king salmon fishing, and its tributary, the Russian River, the Kasilof River, and the Anchor River. Kachemak Bay, an inlet off the larger Cook Inlet, extends into the peninsula&#x27;s southwest end, much of which is part of Kachemak Bay State Park.

It is home to both the Sargent Icefield and Harding Icefields and the numerous glaciers assosciated with them, including Tustumena Glacier, Exit Glacier, and McCarty Glacier.

==Towns and cities==
The peninsula includes several of the most populous towns in Southcentral Alaska, including Seward on the Gulf of Alaska Coast, Soldotna, Kenai, Sterling, and Cooper Landing along the Cook Inlet and Kenai River, and Homer, along Kachemak Bay, along with numerous smaller villages and settlements.

==Transportation==

Homer marks the terminus of the paved highway system of North America, while nearby Anchor Point is the most westerly point on the contiguous highway system. Seward is the southern terminus of the Alaska Railroad. The Seward Highway connects Seward to Anchorage, while the Sterling Highway connects the large population centers to the Seward Highway. The Kenai Spur Highway connects Soldotna, Kenai, Nikiski and Captain Cook State Recreation Area,

Commercial airports with service to Anchorage are located in Kenai and Homer. Smaller airports are located in Soldotna, Seward, and Seldovia.

The Alaska Marine Highway services Homer and Seldovia. Seward is a major cruise ship port.

==Natural resources and economy==
The peninsula also has natural gas, petroleum, and coal deposits, as well as abundant commercial and personal-use fisheries. Tourism is a major industry, along with outfitting and guiding services for hunters and fishers. The Kenai Peninsula is known as &quot;Alaska&#x27;s Playground&quot;. Kenai National Wildlife Refuge encompasses nearly two million acres of the peninsula.

<text>Charles Gardner Radbourn (December 11, 1854 – February 5, 1897), nicknamed &quot;Old Hoss&quot;, was an American professional baseball pitcher who played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for Buffalo (1880), Providence (1881–1885), Boston (National League) (1886–1889), Boston (Player&#x27;s League) (1890), and Cincinnati (1891).

Born in New York and raised in Illinois, Radbourn played semi-professional and minor league baseball before making his major league debut for Buffalo in 1880. After a one-year stint with the club, Radbourn joined the Providence &quot;Grays.&quot; During the 1884 season, Radbourn won 60 games, setting an MLB single-season record that has never been broken, or even seriously approached. He also led the National League (NL) in earned run average (ERA) and strikeouts to win the Triple Crown, and the Grays won the league championship. After the regular season, he helped the Grays win the 1884 World Series, pitching every inning of the three games.

In 1885, when the Grays team folded, the roster was transferred to NL control, and Radbourn was claimed by Boston. He spent the next four seasons with the club, spent one year with the Boston franchise of the single-season Players&#x27; League, and finished his MLB career with Cincinnati. In 1939, Radbourn was posthumously inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Radbourn was born on December 11, 1854, in Rochester, New York, the second of eight children to Charles and Caroline (Gardner) Radbourn. Charles Radbourn (the elder) had immigrated to the United States from Bristol, England, to find work as a butcher; Caroline followed soon after.

In 1855, the Radbourn family moved to Bloomington, Illinois, where Radbourn was raised. As a teenager, Radbourn worked as a butcher with his father, and as a brakeman for the Indiana, Bloomington and Western Railway company.

==Early baseball career==
In 1878, Radbourn joined the Peoria Reds, a barnstorming team, as their right fielder and &quot;change pitcher&quot;. No substitutions were allowed at the time so if the starting pitcher became ineffective in the late innings the change pitcher, usually playing right field, would exchange positions with the starter to try to save the game. In 1879 he signed with Dubuque in the newly formed Northwest League. Radbourn made the major leagues in 1880 as second baseman, right fielder and change pitcher for the Buffalo Bisons of the National League. He played in six games, batted .143, and never pitched an inning, but practiced so hard he developed a sore shoulder and was released. When he recovered, he pitched for a pick-up Bloomington team in an exhibition game against the Providence Grays. He impressed everyone so much that Providence signed him on the spot for a salary variously reported as $1,100 or $1,400.

==Providence Grays==
===1881–1883===
During Radbourn&#x27;s first season with the Grays in 1881, he split pitching duties with John Montgomery Ward. Radbourn pitched 325.1 innings and compiled a win–loss record of 25–11. He became the team&#x27;s primary pitcher in 1882, pitching 466 innings and going 33–19 with a 2.11 earned run average. He led the NL with 201 strikeouts and six shutouts and was second-best in wins and ERA. In 1883, he pitched 632.1 innings and led the league in wins, going 48–25. His 2.05 ERA and 315 strikeouts both ranked second in the NL.

===1884 season===

When Providence failed to win the pennant in 1883, the franchise was on shaky financial ground. Ownership brought in a new manager, Frank Bancroft, and made it plain: win the pennant or the team would be disbanded.

Early in the season, Radbourn shared pitching duties with Charlie Sweeney. Radbourn, who had a reputation for being vain, became jealous as Sweeney began to have more success, and the tension eventually broke out into violence in the clubhouse. Radbourn was faulted as the initiator of the fight and was suspended without pay after a poor outing on July 16, having been accused of deliberately losing the game by lobbing soft pitches over the plate. But on July 22, Sweeney had been drinking before the start of the game and continued drinking in the dugout between innings. Despite being obviously intoxicated, Sweeney managed to make it to the seventh inning with a 6–2 lead; when Bancroft attempted to relieve him with the change pitcher, Sweeney verbally abused him before being ejected and storming out of the park, leaving Providence with only eight players. With only two players to cover the three outfield positions, the Grays lost the lead, then lost the game.

Afterward, Sweeney was kicked off the Grays, and this left the team in a state of disarray with the consensus view that the team should be disbanded. At that point, Radbourn offered to start every game for the rest of the season (having pitched in 76 of 98 games the season before) in exchange for a small raise and exemption from the reserve clause for the next season. From that point, July 23 to September 24 when the pennant was clinched, Providence played 43 games and Radbourn started 40 of them and won 36. Soon, pitching every other day as he was, his arm became so sore he couldn&#x27;t raise it to comb his hair. On game day he was at the ballpark hours before the start, getting warmed up. He began his warm up by throwing just a few feet, increasing the distance gradually until he was pitching from second base and finally from short center field.

Radbourn finished the season with a league-leading 678.2 innings pitched and 73 complete games, and he won the Triple Crown with a record of 60–12, a 1.38 earned run average, and 441 strikeouts. His 60 wins in a season is a record which is expected never to be broken because no starter has made even as many as 37 starts in a season since Greg Maddux did so in 1991. Also, his 678.2 innings pitched stands at second all-time, behind only Will White (680 in 1879) for a single season.

After the regular season ended, the NL champion Grays played the American Association champion New York Metropolitans in the 1884 World Series. Radbourn started each game of the series and won all three, while allowing just three runs, all unearned.

====Statistical notes====

There is a discrepancy in Radbourn&#x27;s victory total in 1884. The classic MacMillan &quot;Baseball Encyclopedia&quot;, the current edition of &quot;The Elias Book of Baseball Records&quot;, his National Baseball Hall of Fame biography, and Baseball-Reference.com all credit Radbourn with 60 wins (against 12 losses). Other sources, including Baseball Almanac, MLB.com, and Edward Achorn&#x27;s 2010 book, &quot;Fifty-nine in &#x27;84&quot;, give Radbourn 59 wins. Some older sources (such as his tombstone plaque) counted as high as 62. There is no dispute about the innings pitched, only over the manner in which victories were assigned to pitchers; the rules in the early years allowed more latitude to the official scorer than they do today.

According to at least two accounts, in the game of July 28 at Philadelphia, Cyclone Miller pitched five innings and left trailing, 4–3. Providence then scored four runs in the top of the sixth. Radbourn came in to relieve, and pitched shutout ball over the final four innings, while the Grays went on to score four more and win the game, 11–4. The official scorer decided that Radbourn had pitched the most effectively, and awarded him the win. Under the rules of the day, the scorekeeper&#x27;s decision certainly made sense. However, under modern scoring rules, Miller would get the win, being the &quot;pitcher of record&quot; when he left the game, and Radbourn would have been credited with a save for closing the game and &quot;pitching effectively for three or more innings&quot;. Some modern sources retroactively awarded the win to Miller.

===1885 season===
Radbourn pitched effectively in the majors for several more years but was not able to duplicate his success of 1883 and 1884. In 1885, he pitched 445.2 innings and went 28–21. The Grays folded after the season, and the roster was transferred to NL control.

==Later baseball career==
Radbourn was claimed by Boston, and he spent the next four seasons with the club, winning 27, 24, 7, and 20 games. He then jumped to the rebel Players&#x27; League and spent 1890 with its Boston club and, after the PL folded, played the 1891 season with Cincinnati, where he recorded his 300th victory before retiring. Radbourn&#x27;s career record was 310–194.

==Later life and legacy==
After retiring from baseball, Radbourn opened up a successful billiard parlor and saloon in Bloomington, Illinois. He was seriously injured in a hunting accident soon after retirement, in which he lost an eye. He died in Bloomington on February 5, 1897, at age 42, and was interred in Evergreen Cemetery.

Radbourn was posthumously inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939. In 1941, a plaque was placed on the back of his elaborate headstone, detailing his distinguished career in baseball. In the 2001 book &quot;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, Bill James ranked Radbourn as the 45th-greatest pitcher of all time.

It is speculated Radbourn might be the namesake of the &quot;charley horse&quot;, a painful leg cramp not unlike that from which he suffered. While the term &quot;charley horse&quot; does come about from the time he was playing baseball and new articles of the time mentioning &quot;the new disease&quot; seem to always relate it to baseball players, it seems to be because &quot;Charley&quot; was for horses as &quot;Rover&quot; is for dogs and a reference to the stiff-leggedness that the condition forces on those who are experiencing it.

Radbourn is also known for being the first person photographed gesturing the middle finger. In 1886, an image was captured of him &quot;flipping off&quot; a member of the New York Giants in a team photo.

<doc id="413552" wikidata="Q4804060" url="?curid=413552" title="Ascott House">
<text>Ascott House, sometimes referred to as simply Ascott, is a Grade II* listed building in the hamlet of Ascott near Wing in Buckinghamshire, England. It is set in a 32-acre / 13 hectare estate.

Ascott House was originally a farm house, built in the reign of James I and known as &quot;Ascott Hall&quot;. In 1873 it was acquired by Baron Mayer Amschel de Rothschild (of the neighbouring Mentmore Towers estate). The Rothschild family had begun to acquire vast tracts of land in Buckinghamshire earlier in the century, on which they built a series of large mansions from 1852 onwards. Baron Mayer gave the house at Ascott to his nephew Leopold de Rothschild, who transformed it over the following decades into the substantial yet informal country house that it is today.

== Architecture ==

Leopold de Rothschild, whose principal country residence was Gunnersbury Park, used Ascott at first as a hunting box, but realising the limitations imposed by its modest size, in 1874 he employed the architect George Devey to enlarge it. The present half-timbered house is largely the result of that commission. Devey attempted to design a house that rambled as though it had grown and developed over centuries. The project became a lifetime work for Devey as the house was continually expanded during the remainder of the 19th century. The rambling and climbing shrubs he had planted as part of the design of the façades that Mary Gladstone described in her memoirs are no longer there.

The style of architecture, which could be described as &quot;English cottage meets Tudor Cheshire Manor house&quot; is informal, the ground floor being of red brick, while the floors above are half-timbered. This rustic design no doubt deliberately reflected the house&#x27;s original intention as a rural retreat and hunting lodge purely for relaxation and pleasure, and contrasted with the family&#x27;s alternative country home, the more classical and thus impressive Gunnersbury Park. Other Rothschild houses in Buckinghamshire were all designed in the more formal styles of architecture, either the classical renaissance such as Mentmore or that of a French château as at Waddesdon Manor. The architecture at Ascott was not intended to faithfully reproduce that of an earlier era. Devey was a forerunner of the Arts and Crafts movement and had developed a rustic style of his own. Huge bay windows provide views over the Chiltern Hills. Multiple gables of varying heights with roof lines sweeping to different levels resemble those later designed by the more notable Edwin Lutyens.

== Interior ==

On the death of Mrs. Leopold de Rothschild in 1937 the house was inherited by her son Anthony Gustav de Rothschild. He and his wife, the former Yvonne D&#x27;Anvers, enlarged the house further, and were responsible for the present interiors, full of notable paintings and (unusually for a Rothschild house) a large collection of 18th-century English furniture.

The ground floor contains the principal suite of large reception rooms, and while these rooms are furnished with works of art and furniture, they are low ceilinged, and, continuing the informal concept of the design, are in no way intended to be state rooms. The entrance hall is notable for its large paintings by Thomas Gainsborough, George Romney, and Joshua Reynolds and the large work by George Stubbs, &quot;Five Mares&quot;. The dining room, now decorated with what appear to be Dutch tiles but is in fact &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot;, contains a collection of small, mainly Dutch, paintings from the 16th and 17th centuries by such artists as Aelbert Cuyp, Adriaen van Ostade and Jan Steen.

The works of art continue through the common room, with its portrait of a prelate attributed to Lorenzo Lotto. The Drawing Room today displays a collection of blue Chinese ceramics with examples from the Han dynasty , to the Qing dynasty which lasted from 1644 until 1911. This room contains the painting of the &quot;Madonna and Child with St. John&quot; by Andrea del Sarto of 1520.

In 1936 the Billiards Room was transformed into a library to house the many volumes amassed by Anthony de Rothschild. One of the most comfortable rooms in the house, its book-lined walls are only interrupted by Gainsborough&#x27;s full-length portrait of the Duchess of Richmond, and various other masterpieces. Standing on a console table is Tiepolo&#x27;s &quot;The Assumption of the Virgin&quot;. The room also contains furniture by Thomas Chippendale and ancient Chinese ceramics.

== Gardens ==

The extensive manicured gardens were laid out on the advice of the garden designer Sir Harry Veitch by Leopold de Rothschild as a wedding present to his wife. A sundial made entirely of topiary complete with Latin numerals proclaims in clipped yew: &quot;Light and shade by turn, but love always&quot;.
Closest to the south front of the house are paved areas of gardens in the style of Gertrude Jekyll, and from these across large areas of lawn are the terraced gardens. The dominating feature of these individual gardens is the clipped hedges, topiary and flowering shrubs. The largest feature of the garden is the bronze fountain representing &quot;Venus in her shell chariot attended by cherubs&quot;, by the American sculptor Thomas Waldo Story. Story was also responsible for the fountain in the Dutch flower garden. This garden, so named for its displays of tulips in spring, is approached by descending a flight of steps through a rock garden, complete with dripping grotto and artificial stalagmites. In the centre of the garden Story&#x27;s tall fountain, crowned by Cupid supported by dolphins, is surrounded by a formal bedding scheme.

From the entrance front&#x27;s adjacent garden of topiarised box and bay trees a long-grassed avenue, enclosed by a tall beech hedge, leads to the lily pool. This pool, originally created for skating, is the heart of a Monet-style garden, complete with a thatched summerhouse also designed by George Devey.

==Cricket ground==
Cricket was first played at Ascott House on 28 August 1880, when an eleven brought from London played an eleven selected by a Mr. Tennant, whose players were partly from London and partly from the area surrounding the estate. Leopold de Rothschild was present for this first match. The Rothschild family played a prominent role in the formation of Buckinghamshire County Cricket Club. Buckinghamshire first played at Ascott House in the 1905 Minor Counties Championship against Hertfordshire, playing there regularly once a season to 1979.

The county returned to Ascott in 1998 to play an MCCA Knockout Trophy match against Berkshire. Minor Counties Championship cricket was last played there in 2003, with Buckinghamshire&#x27;s last venture to the ground coming 2009 in the MCCA Knockout Trophy against Lincolnshire. The ground held a List A match once, which came in the 2003 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy when first-class county Gloucestershire were the visitors. The match was something of a mismatch, with Gloucestershire scoring a massive 401/7, then bowling Buckinghamshire out for 77 to win the match by 324 runs.

== Ascott today ==

Ascott House, with some of its important art collection and a small part of the estate, was given in 1947 to the National Trust by Anthony de Rothschild. The National Trust market the property under the name &quot;Ascott&quot;. However, as at nearby Waddesdon Manor, the Rothschild family retain a very close control. The last resident of the house was the son of the donor, Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, who died in 2022. He added further works of art and ceramics to the collection and much of what is seen in the collection is still privately owned by the Rothschild family.

Sir Evelyn de Rothschild also expanded the estate to its present size of approximately 3200 acres (13 km2). The estate contains many miles of new road-side tree planting, well-kept hedging, and cropping and planting of new woodland but retains some of the older permanent pasture and small fields. A major new road, the A505 ploughs through the area between the house and its Stud Farm, but has been disguised by dense woodland planting.

The house retains very much the feel of a private home, and is open to the public in the afternoon of many weekdays during summer.

<doc id="413555" wikidata="Q82681" url="?curid=413555" title="Tlaxcala">
<text>Tlaxcala, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Tlaxcala, is one of the 32 federal entities that comprise the Federal Entities of Mexico. It is divided into 60 municipalities and the capital city and the largest city is Tlaxcala de Xicohténcatl.

It is located in east-central Mexico, in the altiplano region, with the eastern portion dominated by the Sierra Madre Oriental. It is bordered by the states of Puebla to the north, east and south, México to the west and Hidalgo to the northwest. It is the smallest state of the republic, accounting for only 0.2% of the country&#x27;s territory.

The state is named after its capital, Tlaxcala, which was also the name of the Pre-Columbian city and culture. The Tlaxcaltec people allied themselves with the Spanish to defeat the Aztecs, with concessions from the Spanish that allowed the territory to remain mostly intact throughout 300 years of colonial period. After Mexican Independence, Tlaxcala was declared a federal territory, until 1857 when it was admitted as a state of the federation.

Most of the state&#x27;s economy is based on agriculture, light industry and tourism. The tourist industry is rooted in Tlaxcala&#x27;s long history with major attractions being archeological sites such as Cacaxtla and colonial constructions in and around Tlaxcala City.

==Name==
The name &quot;Tlaxcala&quot; pre-dates the state by centuries; it derives from the name of the capital city, which was also used to denote the territory controlled by this city in pre-Hispanic times. According to some historians, the name comes from an ancient word (), which meant &#x27;crag&#x27;; however, an alternative etymology stems from the Nahuatl word which means &#x27;place of corn tortillas&#x27;. The Aztec glyph that referred to this place has both elements, two green hills and two hands holding a corn tortilla.

The letter &#x27;x&#x27; in the name reflects the voiceless palato-alveolar fricative , a historical phoneme present in Nahuatl and in Old Spanish. The conquistadors transcribed this sound using that letter in the Spanish language at the time of colonization and also when codifying the alphabets of the indigenous languages in the Americas for the first time. Due to the evolution of the coronal fricatives that took place in Spanish during the 16th and 17th centuries, transitioned into a voiceless velar fricative (similar to a strong &#x27;H&#x27;) at the beginning of a word or intervocalically, while it turned into a voiceless alveolar fricative at the end of a syllable. Thus, the pronunciation of Tlaxcala at the time of the sibilant shift transitioned from to . However, the realization is also present due to spelling pronunciation after the Spanish orthographic reform of 1815, which replaced the letter &#x27;x&#x27; with &#x27;j&#x27; in words that previously had that transitioned into velar , leaving the letter &#x27;x&#x27; with the current pronunciation .

==Coat-of-arms==
The state&#x27;s coat of arms is based on the coat of arms that was granted to the city in 1535. Its different elements have the following meanings: the red background represents courage; the castle symbolizes defensive power; the eagle with its open wings represents the spirit of vigilance; the border symbolizes protection and compensation; the green palms stand for victory, and the crowns are the symbol of royal authority.

The letter &quot;&quot; refers to Joanna of Castile, the mother of Charles I of Spain; the letter &quot;K&quot; (for &quot;Karl&quot;) represents the name of the king himself; and the letter &quot;F&quot; (for &quot;Felipe&quot;) belongs to Philip, later Philip II of Spain. The human skulls and cross-bones represent those who died during the Conquest.

==Geography==

===Political geography===
The state of Tlaxcala is located slightly east of center of Mexico between 97°37′07″ and 98°42′51″W and 19°05′43″ and 19°44′07″N. It is bordered by the states of Hidalgo, Puebla and Mexico. It is the smallest state in terms of territory with only about , representing about 0.2% of the entire country. The state is divided into 60 municipalities, the largest of which are Tlaxcala, Apizaco, Huamantla, Zacatelco, Calpulalpan, Chiautempan and Tlaxco. 
The political heart of the state is its capital, Tlaxcala, even though it is not the state&#x27;s largest city. Tlaxcala lies at the foot of the northwestern slope of La Malinche volcano in the Sierra Madre Oriental. It is one of the oldest cities in Mexico, founded as an organized civilization before the 15th century. The Spanish political entity was founded by Hernán Cortés between 1520 and 1525 and given the Spanish name of New City of Our Lady of the Assumption. Its economy is still based on the traditional enterprises of agriculture, textiles, and the commerce of products of native peoples such as the Otomí, especially on market days. Other important cities include Santa Ana Chiautempan, the most populous city in the state, Apizaco, noted for its textile production and Huamantla, a farming and cattle town.

===Natural geography and climate===

Tlaxcala is a land-locked state situated on the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. The average altitude for the state is 2,230 meters above sea level, making it a bit higher than the Valley of Mexico just to the southwest. The western part of the state lies on the central plateau of Mexico while the east is dominated by the Sierra Madre Oriental, home of the 4,461 meter La Malinche volcano. Most of the state is rugged terrain dominated by ridges and deep valleys, along with protruding igneous rock formations. This ruggedness, along with large-scale weather phenomena such as the Intertropical Convergence Zone, gives the state a complex climate. Overall rain patterns for the state are about in the summer rainy season and in the winter. Locally, however, this varies dramatically between the drier plateaus and valleys and the wetter mountains. Variations in altitude produce sub-climates between semi-tropical to temperate, with frosts likely in the higher elevations during the winter. Temperate fir (&quot;Abies religiosa&quot;), juniper (&quot;Juniperus deppeana&quot;), and pine-oak forests dominate the mountain highlands, while the flatlands, with their drier climate, are characterized by agaves and prickly pear cactus (&quot;Opuntia&quot;).

The state has no major lakes or large rivers. The principal water sources are the Atoyac-Zahuapan basin and the reservoir of the Atlangatepec dam.

==Economy==

===Agriculture===

Much of Tlaxcala&#x27;s economy is based on agriculture, livestock and forestry. Principle crops for the state are maize and barley, along with important quantities of wheat, beans, animal feed and potatoes, using about 60% of the state&#x27;s land. Although the state has 15 dams and 483 wells to provide water for agriculture, 88% of the state&#x27;s agriculture is dependent on the summer rainy season, leaving it vulnerable to climatic phenomena such as El Niño or La Niña.

Most livestock raised in the state is beef cattle and dairy cows along with the renowned fighting bulls. Other important animals are pigs, sheep, horses, poultry and bees. About 35,842 hectares, or 6.7% of the state is dedicated to livestock. Due to the limited surface water, there is no commercial fishing or fish-farming here.

The state&#x27;s forestry enterprises are located in the municipalities of Tlaxco, Terrenate, Altzayanca, Calpulalpan and Nanacamilpa, with about 35,842 hectares of land dedicated to this. However, the amount of land dedicated to forestry has been declining in recent years. To combat this, in 2007 2,484,687 trees were planted on about 2,477 hectares of land.

===Industry and commerce===

Light manufacturing has developed on a significant scale in the state, especially products produced for export outside the state. These products include clothing, foam and plastic products, paper products, publishing, textiles and automobile works. Organized industrial areas in the state include the Malinche Corridor, the Apizaco-Xalostoc-Huamantla Corridor, the Panzacola Corridor, the “industrial cities” of Xicohténcatli I, Xicohténcatli II and Xicohténcatli III, the industrial parks of Calpulalpan, Xiloxoxtla, Ixtacuixtla, and Nanacamilpa as well as the industrial areas of Velasco and Atlangatepec.

Most commercial activity in the state occurs in the municipalities of Apizaco, Chiautempan, Tlaxcala, Huamantla, San Pablo del Monte and Zacatelco. In the last economic census in 2003, INEGI registered 21,307 commercial establishments in the state, most of these being small individually or family-owned enterprises. There are also fifty-nine tianguis (tent markets which are movable), seventeen municipal markets, eleven malls, twenty-six department stores and fourteen commercial centers of other types.
In addition, the state is an important link between Mexico&#x27;s major eastern port, Veracruz, on the Gulf of Mexico, and Mexico City, in the interior.

===Tourism===

Tourist attractions primarily consist of pre-Hispanic archaeological sites and colonial establishments, with examples of both religious and civil constructions. However, in comparison with the rest of Mexico, Tlaxcala&#x27;s archaeological and colonial sites are barely known. Tlaxcala&#x27;s major attractions are the archaeological sites of Cacaxtla, Xochitécatl and Tizatlán, which were not fully investigated until the 20th century, unlike most sites within the state. When Hernán Cortés came, Mesoamerican civilization here was considered to be in the Post-Classic stage, and the kingdom was filled with temples, palaces and grand plazas that impressed the Spaniards.

Tlaxcala&#x27;s two major archaeological sites are Xochitécatl and Cacaxtla. Xochitécatl was built between 300 and 400 A.D., and probably reached its peak between 600 and 800 A.D. There is evidence that occupation of the sites extends much further back in time than the early city’s known habitation. The ceremonial center is situated on a hill with four main structures called “The Spiral Building,” “The Volcano Base,” “The Serpent Pyramid” and “The Flower Pyramid.” The last is the most important, and is topped by two monolithic pillars. This pyramid is the fourth largest in Mexico (by base size), and the Spiral Pyramid is one of the few circular ones ever to be found.

Cacaxtla was built later than Xochitécatl, between 600 and 900 A.D., and is the far larger of the two. It was only re-discovered in 1975, by farmers from the nearby town of San Miguel del Milago, who began discovering archaeological artifacts in the fields. The main attractions here are the murals, painted with pigments sourced from local minerals. Some of the best works include the Scorpion Man at the Venus Temple, Cacaxtli with corn plant at the Red Temple, the Battle Mural (which is 22 meters long, portraying 48 human figures), and the Bird Man and the Jaguar Man found in “Porch A.”

Another interesting archeological site is called Tizatlán. This site does not contain pyramids; instead the buildings here are made of adobe brick, a very unusual construction material for this place and time. The site contains two stucco-covered altars with murals that follow the Borgia Group codex style with images of gods and important human figures, including gods such as Tezcatlipoca, Tlaloc and Mayahuel and were the scene of human sacrifices.

The state contains more than 1,000 archeological sites with only seven fully excavated and open to the public. The last of these is Ocotelulco, situated on a hill near the town of San Francisco Ocotelulco. It is a collection of dwellings with raised areas for ceremonial purposes. Its altar is similar to the one found at Tezcatlipoca, decorated with colorful frescos with images of Quetzalcoatl, Xolotl and Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli. These images are in the style of the Post-classic period and have been dated to about 1450.
Tlaxcala is home to some of the earliest colonial architecture and art. The oldest church in Mexico, built in 1521 and the first monasteries, built by the Franciscans, were built here in 1524. Many other churches and monasteries were built in the state in the 16th and early 17th centuries. Just about every municipality has colonial-era structures such as churches, municipal palaces and plazas but the best examples are in and around the city of Tlaxcala. The Temple and Ex-monastery of San Francisco, built in the early 16th century, is located about 14 km southeast of the capital city. Only the church retains its original function; the former monastery now houses a school. The State Government Palace is located in the city proper and was creating by conjoining the former mayor&#x27;s house, the treasury and the state warehouse, which is architecturally held together with a Plateresque facade. The city&#x27;s cathedral, called Nuestra Señora de la Asunción, built in the 16th century. Its main altar preserves a Baroque altarpiece with a depiction of the baptism of the Lord Maxixcatzin, with Hernán Cortés and Malinche as godparents. A bit later, the Basilica of Octolan was built in the 17th and 18th centuries to comply with a demand of the Virgin Mary who reportedly appeared before Juan Diego Bernardino here in 1541. It is considered be the culmination of the Baroque style in Tlaxcala. The state also contains 140 haciendas, which vary in their state of conservation but some are promoted for tourism.

Regional festivals here are known for dances featuring men in mustached masks (imitating Spaniards), large-plumed hats and colorful garb. This is especially apparent during Carnival, when over 4,000 folk dancers from different villages come to the capital to celebrate. In a village just north of the capital, in San Juan Totolac, every year they commemorate the departure of 400 families in 1591 who went north to colonize the land known as the Great Chichimeca, which primarily covers the northeast of modern Mexico. Streets in Huamantla are decorated with flowers in intricate designs on “La Noche que Nadie Duerme” (The Night No One Sleeps) in August. Many other festivals are in the state, many of which display the state&#x27;s long tradition of bullfighting.

Ecotourism is relatively new here and much of it centers on La Malinche National Park, home to the La Malinche volcano, which is 4,461 m (14,636 ft) high. Here one can camp, mountain bike, horseback ride, rappel and climb the volcano itself. At the peak of La Malinche, it is possible to see the volcanos of Popocatépetl, Iztaccíhuatl (in Puebla/Mexico State) and Pico de Orizaba (Veracruz).

Ninety five percent of those visiting Tlaxcala are from Mexico and most of these are from neighboring Puebla state. Foreign visitors are mostly German, French and Swiss who are interested in Mexican history.

===Sex trade and human trafficking===

Tenancingo, a town in Tlaxcala, is the beginning of a pipeline in an illicit, international trafficking trade, and considered to be the center for sex trafficking in Mexico. Roots of the practice of sex trafficking date back to the 1960s. An unnamed Mexican charity told the BBC that it estimated of the 10,000 inhabitants of Tenancingo, 1,000 are sex traffickers. Sexual exploitation, human trafficking, and pimping are a major source of income for the town, although an exact dollar amount is not known. These practices have been denounced by three NGOs. Modern-day investigations (as well as the 2014 documentary “Pimp City: A Journey to the Center of the Sex Trade”) by the US Department of Justice have revealed Tenancingo to be a hub for providing female sex slaves to the United States. According to the documentary, the entire political structure and police force of the town are implicated in human trafficking and the sex trade.

==Demographics==

Tlaxcala is the smallest and one of the most densely populated of the states of Mexico. The state comprises only 0.2% of the nation&#x27;s territory, but had a population of 1,068,207 in 2005. Population density ranges from 50 people/km2 in the rural municipality of Atlangatepec to 269 people/km2 in the city of Tlaxcala.

The largest population centers are Tlaxcala, Huamantla, Apizaco, San Pablo del Monte, Zacatelco and Chiautempan, whose 361,328 inhabitants represent over 33% of the state&#x27;s population. However, the largest population increases are occurring in the municipalities of Tzompamtepec, Yauhquemecan, and Santa Isabel Xiloxoxtla. Of Tlaxcala&#x27;s 60 municipalities, ten have a poverty index rating of “very low,” twenty-nine have a rating of “low,” seventeen have a ranking of “medium” and only four have a ranking of “high.”

According to data through the II Census of Population and Housing conducted by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) with census date of June 12, 2010, the state of Tlaxcala until this year had a total of 1,169,936 inhabitants; of that number, 565,775 were men and 604,161 were women. The annual growth rate for the entity during the period 2005-2010 was 1.8%.

The average size of households in the state is 4.3, while the national level is 3.9, according to the 2010 population census, however, by municipality varies from 3.8 to 5 persons per household.

In the same year (2010) on average in the state of Tlaxcala 293 people per square kilometer, while nationally there are 57 people per square kilometer. Until that year 78% of the population lives in urban areas and 22% in rural, data also the II Census of Population and Housing conducted by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) in 2010.
==History==

The area known as Tlaxcala has officially been a number of different entities, from an indigenous kingdom during the Pre-Columbian era, a district of the colonial Viceroyalty of New Spain, a territory of the Republic of Mexico, and finally a “free and sovereign&quot; state in Mexico. Tlaxcalans consider their fight to remain a distinct entity a hallmark of their history, resisting in turn the Aztecs, the Spanish colonial government, the various monarchies and republics of an independent Mexico, and even the claims on its territory by its neighboring state of Puebla.

===Pre-Columbian===

Evidence of human occupation in what is now the state of Tlaxcala extends back to 12,000 BCE, with the earliest identified cultures being Tzompantepec (1700–1200 BCE), Tlatempa (1200–800 BCE), and Texoloc (800–400 BCE). The Toltecs also had a presence, but the first major native culture here was the Olmec Xicalanca. This civilization fell into decline after 900 AD and was replaced by a sub-group of the Chichimecas. In the 14th century, the Chichimecas were driven out by the Tlaxcalans, a Nahua people and the indigenous ethnicity that still dominates the state. The Tlaxcalans founded the city of Tlaxcala and then began to subdue the surrounding peoples. Eventually, the Tlaxcalan nation would evolve into a confederation of four sub-states called Tepectipac, Ocotelulco, Tizatlán and Quiahuixtlán.

The pre-Columbian Tlaxcalan state developed roughly at the same time as another Nahua people, the Mexica, were building the vast Aztec Empire with its capital at Tenochtitlan. From the 14th century, these two nations were in near constant state of war. However, even though the Aztecs managed to build the largest empire in Mesoamerica, they never did conquer Tlaxcala. By the time the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, Tlaxcala was an independent enclave nearly completely surrounded by the Aztec Empire. This left Tlaxcala economically isolated, leaving it without goods such as cotton and salt. This and the constant warfare with the Mexica would give the Tlaxcalans reasons to ally with the Spanish.

===Spanish era===

====Conquest====

When Hernán Cortés and the Spanish landed on the Veracruz coast, they were greeted by the Totonacas, who were a subject people of the Aztecs and saw the Spanish as a way to free themselves of rule from Tenochtitlan. They allied with the Spanish, and when Cortés decided to go inland to Tenochtitlan, the Totonacas guided them to other subject peoples who would be willing to ally with them, including and especially the Tlaxcalans. However, after entering Tlaxcalan territory, the Spanish were met by a hostile Tlaxcalan force of 30,000. The Tlaxcalans fought the Spanish and their indigenous allies in a number of battles, with the Spanish inflicting heavy casualties on the Tlaxcalans despite their superior numbers. The Spaniards’ prowess in battle impressed the Tlaxcalan King Xīcohtēncatl Āxāyacatzin, who then not only allowed the Spanish to pass through his territory, but also invited them into the capital city of Tlaxcala.

Cortés stayed in the city of Tlaxcala for 20 days and forged an alliance with the Tlaxcalans to bring down Tenochtitlan. Cortes added 6,000 Tlaxcala warriors to his ranks and arrived to Tenochtitlan in November 1519. They were received by Emperor Moctezuma II, who understood the potential danger of a Spanish-Tlaxcalan alliance. Despite initial friendliness, intrigue and siege of the capital followed, with the Aztec backlash sending Cortes’ very wounded army limping back to Tlaxcalan territory. The Tlaxcalan king gave the Spanish refuge but promised further assistance in the conquest of Tenochtitlan only under certain conditions including perpetual exemption from tribute of any sort, part of the spoils of war, and control of two provinces that bordered Tlaxcala. Cortés agreed. Cortes and the Tlaxcalans returned to Tenochtitlan in December 1520. After many battles, including street-by-street fighting in Tenochtitlan itself, the Aztec Empire fell in August 1521.

====Colonial period====
Historian Charles Gibson published (1952) a path breaking study of Tlaxcala, from the indigenous viewpoint. He particularly focused on ways that the Tlaxcalans shaped the polity&#x27;s history for its own advantage, and how the four-part organization of the polity was maintained during the early colonial era. A particularly important source for the early colonial history of Tlaxcala is a set of records in the indigenous language of Nahuatl, now published as &quot;The Tlaxcalan Actas&quot;. These town council records are a type of indigenous language source used by scholars in the field known as the New Philology. James Lockhart drew on these materials in his study &quot;The Nahuas After the Conquest&quot; For the most part, the Spanish kept their promise to the Tlaxcalans. Unlike Tenochtitlan and other cities, Tlaxcala was not destroyed after the Conquest. They also allowed many Tlaxcalans to retain their indigenous names. The Tlaxcalans were mostly able to keep their traditional form of government. For 300 years of colonial Viceroyalty of New Spain rule, the Spanish mostly held true to the Tlaxcalans&#x27; conditions of 1520.

One of the major cultural interventions, however, was the evangelization of the region. Franciscan friars arrived in 1524. They built monasteries and churches and renamed the city of Tlaxcala “Nuestra Señora de la Asunción.” The first archbishopric of New Spain was established here. Most of the conversion work was done by 1530. In 1535, the city of Tlaxcala received its coat-of-arms from the Spanish king.
Unlike the rest of Mexico, Tlaxcala was under the direct protection of the Spanish crown, part of its reward for its support in the Conquest. This shielded the Tlaxcalans from the worst of the oppression of the native peoples, which reached its peak in the 1530s. In fact, Tlaxcalan allegiance to the Spaniards became an enduring partnership. Tlaxcalan forces joined Spanish forces to put down revolts such as the Mixtón Rebellion and accompanied them to conquer places such as Guatemala and northern Mexico.

In the late 16th century, Christianized and sedentary Tlaxcalans were recruited to settle and pacify the Chichimecas in what is now northeast Mexico. Tlaxcalans were used not only to fight but also to establish towns in villages in this nomadic people&#x27;s territory, to be a kind of example to them. Over 400 Tlaxcalan families would move north, but not until they negotiated and won special concessions from the Spanish. They included orders called “mandamientos de amparo” to ensure that these families’ heirs would not lose the lands that were being granted to them. They also included freedom from tributes, taxes and personal service in perpetuity. These settlers were instrumental in pacifying this part of Mexico, and although these families eventually intermarried with the Chichimeca, they never completely lost their Tlaxcalan identity.

During the colonial period, the Tlaxcalans were successful in keeping the concessions granted to them by the Spanish crown. In 1585, when the territory of Tlaxcala was formally established, it roughly had the same borders as the old kingdom of Tlaxcala. While the neighboring territory of Puebla had some authority over this territory, the city of Tlaxcala remained independently governed until Mexican Independence in 1821.

However, the indigenous population who had been living in Tlaxcala were somehow reduced to a small minority. Tlaxcala in 1519 had a population estimated at 150,000 to 500,000, the larger estimate perhaps including allies, such as those in the adjacent Pueblo valley. According to Catholic Encyclopedia, in 1625 the formerly sizeable city of Tlaxcala had only 700 people. The decline in the population was due to epidemics, emigrations, and the construction of a canal which served the Mexican Valley.

===Post-independence era===
After victory in the Mexican War of Independence and the end of the First Mexican Empire with the 1824 Constitution of Mexico, on November 24, 1824, Tlaxcala was declared a federal territory, Tlaxcala Territory. Tlaxcala was finally admitted as a state of the federation on December 9, 1856. The state was subdivided into five provinces, but had roughly the same dimensions, but somewhat less than before. Later, the state was able to recover some of that lost territory when the region known as Calpulapan was reunited in the 1860s. The state was governed from 1885 to 1911 by Próspero Cahuantzi, one of the few Mexicans of indigenous origin to be a state governor.

==Gastronomy==
The cuisine of the state is similar to that of neighboring Hidalgo, Puebla and Federal District of Mexico City, featuring dishes such as barbacoa, mixiote, tamales, tacos, quesadillas and more. The state is known for the use of a number of ingredients in these dishes. One of these is the use of a number of edible insects, many of which are considered delicacies, such as &quot;escamoles&quot; (ant eggs) and maguey larvae, as well as others locally known as &quot;padrecitos,&quot; &quot;mecapales,&quot; &quot;toritos&quot; and &quot;tenanas&quot;. Vegetable items include a wide variety of mushrooms (often harvested from the wild), squash flowers, chilacayote, xoconostle (a kind of cactus fruit), nopal and epazote. Like neighboring Puebla, moles are an important element, especially for dishes made for special occasions. Two local versions include &quot;mole prieto&quot; and &quot;mole de ladrillo.&quot;

==Education==
The formal state educational system of the state accommodates only 53% of eligible schoolchildren. Almost all of the rest are schooled in pre-schools, indigenous educational systems and other centers. Primary and secondary education is mostly provided by the state Secretary of Education. Indigenous education is a system of preschools and primary schools which meet the cultural demands of indigenous populations of the state. These are largely located in the municipalities of Ixtenco, Contla de Juan C., San Pablo del Monte, Teolocholco, Tetlanohcan and la Magdalena.

High school and vocational education is provided by state school systems named CBTIS, CETIS, CECYTE, CBTA, COBAT, and CONALEP. Most of these schools are of the vocational type. Higher education is provided by both public and prívate institutions, with the most important of these being the Universidad Autónoma de Tlaxcala (UAT), which also offers the widest range of majors. Other public universities and colleges include the Instituto Tecnológico de Apizaco, Instituto Tecnológico Agropecuario de Xocoyucan, Escuela Normal Estatal Lic. Benito Juárez, and the Universidad Tecnológica de Tlaxcala. Private institutions include the Universidad del Valle, Universidad de Calpulalpan, Instituto Tecnológico de Tlaxcala and UPAEP Tlaxcala.

In addition to traditional centers of education there are state-run technical training centers, which are considered to be an educational priority for Tlaxcala. These centers train people with short courses with industrial or trade skills. Some of these centers include the Centro de Capacitación Tecnológica Industrial (CECATI) and the Instituto de capacitación para el Trabajo en Tlaxcala (ICATLAX).

The state also has a library system with 129 public libraries located in 59 municipalities, with a collection of 588,758 volumes.

==Media==
Newspapers of Tlaxcala include: &quot;El Sol de Tlaxcala&quot;, and &quot;Síntesis, El Periódico de Tlaxcala.&quot;

<doc id="413556" wikidata="Q653794" url="?curid=413556" title="All Along the Watchtower">
<text>&quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; is a song by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan from his eighth studio album, &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; (1967). The song was written by Dylan and produced by Bob Johnston. The song&#x27;s lyrics, which in its original version contain twelve lines, feature a conversation between a joker and a thief. The song has been subject to various interpretations; some reviewers have noted that it echoes lines in the Book of Isaiah, Chapter 21, verses 5–9. Dylan has released several different live performances, and versions of the song are included on some of his subsequent greatest hits compilations.

Covered by numerous artists, &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; is strongly identified with the interpretation Jimi Hendrix recorded with the Jimi Hendrix Experience for their third studio album, &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; (1968). The Hendrix version, released six months after Dylan&#x27;s original recording, became a Top 20 single in 1968, received a Grammy Hall of Fame award in 2001, and was ranked 48th in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2004 (40th in the 2021 version). Dylan first played the song live in concert on the Bob Dylan and the Band 1974 Tour, his first tour since 1966. His live performances have been influenced by Hendrix&#x27;s cover, to the extent that they have been called covers of a cover. Dylan has performed the song live more than any of his others, with over 2,250 recitals.

==Bob Dylan original version==
===Background and recording===
Following a motorcycle accident in July 1966, Dylan spent the next 18 months recuperating at his home in Woodstock and writing songs. According to Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin, all the songs for &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot;, Dylan&#x27;s eighth studio album, were written and recorded during a six-week period at the end of 1967. With one child born in early 1966 and another in mid-1967, Dylan had settled into family life. Dylan has claimed that he thought of the song during a thunderstorm. He recorded &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; on November 6, 1967, at Columbia Studio A in Nashville, Tennessee, the same studio where he had completed &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; the previous year. Accompanying Dylan, who played acoustic guitar and harmonica, were two Nashville veterans from the &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; sessions: Charlie McCoy on bass guitar and Kenneth Buttrey on drums. The producer was Bob Johnston, who produced Dylan&#x27;s two previous albums, &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; in 1965 and &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; in 1966, and the sound engineer was Charlie Bragg.

The final version of &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; resulted from two different takes during the second of three &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; sessions. The session opened with five takes of the song, the third and fifth of which were spliced to create the album track. According to Gray, as with most of the album&#x27;s selections, the song is a dark, sparse work that stands in stark contrast with Dylan&#x27;s previous recordings of the mid-1960s.

===Composition and lyrical interpretation===

====Music====
Musicologist Wilfrid Mellers, noting the biblical references &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;, wrote that the song &quot;heroically confronts, in grandly swinging Aeolian melody, deeply oscillating bass and thrusting rhythm, the chaos of fallen man&quot;. Mellers considered that the sense of threat expressed in the lyrics was &quot;not exterior to the tune which remains, in its noble arches over its gravely descending bass, unruffled&quot;. 

Musicology scholar Albin Zak finds a strong blues influence in the song which Dylan developed from his affinity for the blues of Robert Johnson and quotes Dylan&#x27;s dedication in &quot;Writings and Drawings by Bob Dylan&quot;: &quot;To the magnificent Woody Guthrie and Robert Johnson who sparked it off and to the great wondrous melodies spirit which covereth the oneness of us all.&quot; Zak sees &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; as showing a combination of the influences of Guthrie&#x27;s ballad writing and Johnson&#x27;s blues influences on Dylan. Zak compares Dylan&#x27;s lyrics in the song directly to Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Me and the Devil Blues&quot; (1938), stating that: &quot;Dylan probes such fearful fatalism (of Johnson&#x27;s lyrics) by grafting a narrative of alienation and apprehension onto a musical frame of implacable stability.&quot;

The music of the song has been described by Zak, who wrote, &quot;The song&#x27;s entire harmonic substance consists of three chords repeated in an unchanging cyclic pattern over the course of its three verses and instrumental interludes. The melodic pitch collection, shared by voice and harmonica, consists almost entirely of the pentatonic C#, E, F#, G#, B, though each part is restricted to a four-note subset. And the declamatory vocal melody gravitates throughout to one of two pitches.&quot; Zak then summarizes the entire song as: &quot;The song&#x27;s musical elements, extraordinarily delimited in number and function, combine to create an impression of unrelenting circularity, which accumulates, in turn, to impart a sense not of musical progression, but of a hovering atmosphere.&quot;

====Lyrics====
The original lyrics are in twelve lines, which the &quot;Financial Times&quot; writer Dan Einac commented, make it &quot;akin to a truncated sonnet&quot;. The lyrics feature a conversation between a joker and a thief, whilst they ride towards a watchtower. Scholar Timothy Hampton comments that the pair are &quot;overwhelmed by circumstances&quot;. Reviewers have pointed out that the lyrics in &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; echo lines in the Book of Isaiah, Chapter 21, verses 5–9:

Other writers such as Keith Negus have indicated that Dylan also drew on verses from the Book of Revelation to write the song. Elliot Wolfson found that Dylan&#x27;s lyrics also reflected his own response to a melancholy reading of his own approach to Jewish gnosis. The general theme of justice is commented upon by Lisa O&#x27;Neill-Sanders, who states that Watchtower presents a &quot;thief in the song... who consoles the victimized and exploited joker. The thief sympathizes but urges the joker to &#x27;not talk falsely&#x27;&quot;.

Journalist David Stubbs interpreted the song as &quot;obliquely allud[ing] to Bob Dylan&#x27;s frustrations with his management and with CBS, whom he felt were offering him a royalty rate that was far from commensurate with his status&quot;. For Stubbs, the song &quot;features a stand-off between the &#x27;joker&#x27; and the &#x27;thief&#x27;, with the joker complaining of businessmen who drink his wine, feeding off him but refusing to give him his due&quot;. Authors Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon suggest that Dylan is the joker and his manager Albert Grossman is the thief. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Robert Palmer expressed his opinion that as artists like Dylan &quot;were finding that serving as the conscience of a generation exacted a heavy toll. Mr. Dylan, for one, felt the pressures becoming unbearable, and wrote about his predicament in songs like &#x27;All Along the Watchtower&#x27;&quot;. Hampton also wrote that the song can be viewed as an &quot;allegory of the entertainment business, with artists exploited by managers&quot;. Commenting on the songs on &quot; John Wesley Harding&quot; in an interview published in the folk music magazine &quot;Sing Out!&quot; in October 1968, Dylan told John Cohen and Happy Traum:

The unusual structure of the narrative was remarked on by English literature scholar Christopher Ricks, who commented that &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; is an example of Dylan&#x27;s audacity at manipulating chronological time, noting &quot;at the conclusion of the last verse, it is as if the song bizarrely begins at last, and as if the myth began again&quot;. Heylin described Dylan&#x27;s narrative technique in the song as setting the listener up for an epic ballad with the first two verses, but then, after a brief instrumental passage, the singer cuts &quot;to the end of the song, leaving the listener to fill in his or her own (doom-laden) blanks&quot;. Hampton remarks on how the &quot;already allegorical characters change into something else&quot; from the first verse to the third verse, and compares this change in perspective to the way that some of Arthur Rimbaud&#x27;s prose poems in Arthur Rimbaud&#x27;s &quot;Illuminations&quot; change their framing.

Andy Gill commented that &quot;In Dylan&#x27;s version of the song, it&#x27;s the barrenness of the scenario which grips, the high haunting harmonica and simple forward motion of the riff carrying understated implications of cataclysm; as subsequently recorded by Jimi Hendrix... that cataclysm is rendered scarily palpable through the dervish whirls of guitar.&quot;

Dave Van Ronk, an early supporter and mentor of Dylan, made the following criticism:

Songwriter Eric Bogle said he was envious of Dylan&#x27;s ability to write a song that is open to several interpretations. Michael Gray wrote that, unlike on &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;, &quot;Dylan&#x27;s surrealism is stripped down to a chilly minimum on &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot;&quot;, and described Dylan&#x27;s use of language in songs like &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; as &quot;impressionism revisited... reflecting wintertime in the psyche&quot;. In his 2021 book on Dylan, Larry Starr added that: &quot;...&#x27;Watchtower&#x27; is a brief, compelling, and mysterious song. Its ominous character is captured memorably in the studio version, which utilizes for accompaniment just Dylan&#x27;s guitar and harmonica... The singing is utterly straightforward, as if recounting a simple parable about the nameless joker and thief; Dylan is not about to disclose a hint of any deeper meaning...&quot;.

===Release and reception===
&quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; was released on December 27, 1967, less than two months after the recording sessions. Peter Johnson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the track &quot;brings out Dylan&#x27;s talent for imagery&quot;, but felt the recording seems &quot;fragmented and unfinished&quot;. It was regarded as the best track on the album by the reviewer for the &quot;Bucks Examiner&quot;. This sentiment was shared by Troy Irvine of &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot;, who felt that &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; was better than any of Dylan&#x27;s earlier albums.

Journalist Paul Williams regarded the song as &quot;an extraordinarily successful interaction&quot; between Dylan, McCoy, and Buttrey, featuring &quot;some of the best cinematography in modern song-writing&quot;. In 2013, Jim Beviglia rated it as the 92nd-best of Dylan&#x27;s songs, writing that Dylan &quot;creates a stifling air of portent and tension with his three succinct verses&quot;. Author Nigel Williamson, in 2021, listed the song 31st in Dylan&#x27;s oeuvre. In a 2020 article for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Alexis Petridis ranked it the 28th-greatest of Dylan&#x27;s songs, commenting that &quot;there&#x27;s a lot to be said for Dylan&#x27;s humble original, its brevity and starkness capturing the same end-times intensity in a different way [to the Hendrix version]&quot;. The following year, &quot;The Guardian&quot; included the song on a list of &quot;80 Bob Dylan songs everyone should know&quot;. Rapper Kanye West identified it as his &quot;favorite song of all time&quot; in a 2022 interview in which he also expressed a desire to work with and write with Dylan.

The track was released as the B-side to &quot;Drifter&#x27;s Escape&quot; in Italy on March 1, 1968, and as an A-side, backed with &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Baby Tonight&quot;, in the Netherlands and Germany on November 22, 1968. In January 1969, the song was one of four &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; songs included on an extended play release in Australia.

==The Jimi Hendrix Experience version==
The Jimi Hendrix Experience began to record their version of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; on January 21, 1968, at Olympic Studios in London. The song is strongly identified with the interpretation Jimi Hendrix recorded with the group for their third studio album &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot;. Hendrix was musically attracted to Dylan&#x27;s songs several times in his career, according to engineer Andy Johns. Hendrix had been given a reel-to-reel tape of Dylan&#x27;s unreleased recordings at that point by publicist Michael Goldstein, who worked for Dylan&#x27;s manager Grossman. &quot;(Hendrix) came in with these Dylan tapes and we all heard them for the first time in the studio&quot;, recalled Johns. He initially intended to record &quot;I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine&quot; but changed this to &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;. Two years later he would also record &quot;Drifter&#x27;s Escape&quot; from the &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; album.

Stubbs writes that this was the second of Dylan&#x27;s songs Hendrix had adapted to his own style, the first being &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; played earlier at Monterey. A third song Hendrix adapted from Dylan is identified by Zak as &quot;Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window&quot;.

===Music===
Dogget described the interpretation of the song: &quot;Hendrix used the sound of the studio to evoke the storms and the sense of dread, creating an echoed aural landscape.&quot; For Zak, the Hendrix version of the song is more than a simple transposition of Dylan&#x27;s harmonica riffs into Hendrix playing riffs on his electric guitar, involving adding a tonal quality of a &quot;self-proclaimed &#x27;Voodoo Child,&#x27; raging and defiant in the guise of a lead guitar.&quot; The layering Hendrix introduces in his version is further intensified and, &quot;unlike the sonic reserve of Dylan&#x27;s recording, here the frequency space teems with dynamic activity. From the highs of the cymbals and tambourines to the lows of the bass guitar and kick drum, the ongoing agitation of the frequency space heightens the track&#x27;s sense of tumult.&quot;

Zak summarizes the Hendrix adaptation of the Dylan song in three main points, stating: &quot;There are three basic strategies apparent in this transformation (of Dylan&#x27;s version): (1) the intensification of essential musical gestures and formal divisions; (2) the introduction of pitch material dissonant with the pentatonic collection of the original; and (3) the tracing of a long-range, goal-directed melodic line over the call-and-response structure of the arrangement. It is in the latter that Hendrix asserts most forcefully his protagonist claim.&quot;

Although Zak has written of both the Dylan and the Hendrix versions of the song as influenced by blues players such as Robert Johnson, he has stated that the Hendrix version is much closer in its blues style to the songs and style of Muddy Waters, stating: &quot;If Dylan&#x27;s crying blues is reminiscent of Robert Johnson, Hendrix&#x27;s shout calls to mind Muddy Waters and his &#x27;deep tone with a heavy beat&#x27;.&quot;

===Recording===
According to Hendrix&#x27;s regular engineer Eddie Kramer, the guitarist cut a large number of takes on the first day of recording in January in London, shouting chord changes at Dave Mason who featured at the session and played an additional 12-string guitar. Halfway through the session, bass player Noel Redding became dissatisfied with the proceedings and left. He would later note that he disliked the song and preferred Dylan&#x27;s version. Mason then took over on bass. According to Kramer, the final bass part was played by Hendrix himself. Hendrix&#x27;s friend and Rolling Stones multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones contributed the dry rattles featured in the intro, played on a vibraslap. This sparse version without any overdubs would eventually appear on the &quot;South Saturn Delta&quot; compilation released in 1997.

Kramer and Chas Chandler mixed the first version of &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; on January 26 in 1968, but Hendrix was quickly dissatisfied with the result and went on re-recording and overdubbing guitar parts during June, July, and August at the Record Plant studio in New York City. Engineer Tony Bongiovi has described Hendrix becoming increasingly dissatisfied as the song progressed, overdubbing more and more guitar parts, moving the master tape from a four-track to a twelve-track to a sixteen-track machine. Bongiovi recalled, &quot;Recording these new ideas meant he would have to erase something. In the weeks prior to the mixing, we had already recorded a number of overdubs, wiping track after track. [Hendrix] kept saying, &#x27;I think I hear it a little bit differently.&#x27;&quot; Apparently, Hendrix was trying to record what Zak has referred to in the song as a &#x27;deep tone with a heavy beat&#x27; which was not highlighted in Dylan&#x27;s version. By the end of the sessions, Kramer and Hendrix had 16 tracks to use for mixing the song that soon became the intended single of the album.

===Release, charts, and certifications===
In the US, Reprise Records issued the song as a single on September 2, 1968, with the B-side featuring &quot;Burning of the Midnight Lamp&quot;, over a month prior to the album release on &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot;. Dylan gave it a glowing review in the Melody Maker magazine, which pleased Hendrix greatly. It reached number 20 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, Hendrix&#x27;s highest ranking American single and only Top 40 hit to date. Track Records released the single on October 18 and it reached number five in the British charts, becoming the first UK stereo-only single to do so. Hendrix soon became reluctant about performing the song live, and after three months it disappeared from the setlist. One notable performance was at the Isle of Wight festival that appeared on the &quot;Blue Wild Angel&quot; live album in 2002. 


=== Impact of the Hendrix recording on Dylan&#x27;s performances ===
In 1995, Dylan described his reaction to hearing Hendrix&#x27;s version: &quot;It overwhelmed me, really. He had such talent, he could find things inside a song and vigorously develop them. He found things that other people wouldn&#x27;t think of finding in there. He probably improved upon it by the spaces he was using. I took license with the song from his version, actually, and continue to do it to this day.&quot; In the booklet accompanying his 1985 &quot;Biograph&quot; album, Dylan said: &quot;I liked Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s record of this and ever since he died I&#x27;ve been doing it that way... Strange how when I sing it, I always feel it&#x27;s a tribute to him in some kind of way.&quot; In 1974, Dylan, with the Band, embarked on his first concert tour since his 1966 world tour. From the first show of the Bob Dylan and the Band 1974 Tour on January 3, 1974, in Chicago, the shows featured what Heylin described as a &quot;Hendrixized&quot; version of &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;. From the first live performance, Dylan has consistently performed the song closer to Hendrix&#x27;s version than to his own original recording.

The 1974 album &quot;Before the Flood&quot;, compiled from concert performances on the tour, included the song. Stubbs contended that through the &quot;more heavy-duty arrangement of it on [the album]&quot;, Dylan &quot;practically conceded that Hendrix made the song his own&quot;. Academics Janet Gezari and Charles Hartman wrote: &quot;In effect, [Dylan] covered a cover of his own song&quot;. They opined that as Dylan&#x27;s vocal range has narrowed and his delivery of lyrics became more brusque, listening to the song in concert, audience members &quot;must either take it as a painfully constricted, even dismissive reference to the song the album gave us in 1967, or hear in it a compendium of all the history, Dylan&#x27;s own and others&#x27;, musical and other, between then and now, or as much of that history as we can know&quot;.

The live recording from &quot;Before the Flood&quot; appeared as the B side of &quot;Most Likely You Go Your Way and I&#x27;ll Go Mine&quot; in 1974. The recordings came from separate concerts earlier that year at the Forum adjacent to Los Angeles, both with Dylan backed by the Band. In &quot;The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia&quot;, Gray noted that this is the most often performed of all of Dylan&#x27;s songs. According to Dylan&#x27;s own website, by November 2018 he had performed the song 2,268 times.

In recent years, Dylan has taken to singing the first verse again at the end of the song in live performances. As Gray notes in his &quot;Bob Dylan Encyclopedia&quot;: Scholar of English Sukanya Saha cites the original conclusion, &quot;two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl&quot; as an example of Dylan&#x27;s talent for providing satisfying endings for songs. Saha goes on to say, &quot;The end rhymes in his songs make his lines appealing as they reverberate in consciousness.&quot;

==Legacy==
The original recording of &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; appears on several of Dylan&#x27;s subsequently released &quot;greatest hits&quot; albums, as well as his two box set compilations, &quot;Biograph&quot;, released in 1985, and &quot;Dylan&quot;, released in 2007. In addition, Dylan has released live recordings of the song on the following albums: &quot;Before the Flood&quot; (recorded February 1974); &quot;Bob Dylan at Budokan&quot; (recorded March 1978); &quot;Dylan &amp; The Dead&quot; (recorded July 1987); and &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; (recorded November 1994). The track has been covered by dozens of artists, including Bobby Womack on &quot;Facts of Life&quot; (1973), XTC on &quot;White Music&quot; (1978), Billy Valentine for the &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; television show (2015) and U2 on &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; (1988). A dance music remix by Funkstar De Luxe was released in 2001.

Hendrix&#x27;s recording of the song appears at number 40 on the 2021 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; 500 Greatest Songs of All Time (up from 48 in the 2004 version), and in 2000, British magazine &quot;Total Guitar&quot; named it top of the list of the greatest cover versions of all time. Hendrix&#x27;s guitar solo was included at number five on &quot;Guitar World&quot;″s list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Solos. His version of &quot;All Along The Watchtower&quot; was listed by &quot;Billboard&quot; in 2015 as one of the &quot;Most Overplayed Songs in Movies&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Far Out&quot; ranked the song number two on their list of the 20 greatest Hendrix songs, and in 2021, &quot;American Songwriter&quot; ranked it number one on their list of his 10 greatest songs. It has been used in dozens of films, including &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, &quot;Rush&quot;, &quot;Watchmen&quot;, and &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot;.

<text>Cook Inlet (; Sugpiaq: &quot;Cungaaciq&quot;) stretches from the Gulf of Alaska to Anchorage in south-central Alaska. Cook Inlet branches into the Knik Arm and Turnagain Arm at its northern end, almost surrounding Anchorage. On its southern end, it merges with Shelikof Strait, Stevenson Entrance, Kennedy Entrance and Chugach Passage.

The Cook Inlet and both its arms are bodies of brackish water, containing a turbid mix of ocean salt-water and freshwater runoff from the various rivers and streams. The narrow channel of the inlet funnels the tides creating very fast-moving currents, rip tides, and occasional bore tides. Cook Inlet watershed is the most populated watershed in Alaska. The watershed covers about of southern Alaska, east of the Aleutian Range, south and east of the Alaska Range, receiving water from its tributaries, which include the Knik River, the Little Susitna River, the Susitna and Matanuska rivers, Eagle River, Ship Creek, Resurrection Creek, Portage Creek, Kenai River, and many others. The watershed includes the drainage areas of Denali (federally designated as Mount McKinley) and is the collection point for the runoff from many surrounding glaciers, leading to the high turbidity and large silt deposits. Within the watershed there are several national parks and the active volcano Mount Redoubt, along with three other historically active volcanoes. Cook Inlet provides navigable access to the port of Anchorage at the northern end, and to the smaller Homer port further south. Before the growth of Anchorage, Knik was the destination for most marine traffic in upper Cook Inlet. Approximately 400,000 people live within the Cook Inlet watershed.

==Geography==

Cook inlet, along with the Kenai Peninsula, the Kenai Mountains, the Chugach Mountains, and Kodiak Island, formed approximately 65 million years ago, just after the extinction of the dinosaurs. Like most of Alaska&#x27;s mountains, they consist mainly of sedimentary rock and metamorphic rock that were deposited on the ocean floor during the Cretaceous period. This area, where a corner of the Pacific Plate subducts under the North American Plate, uplifted the ocean floor and compressed it, causing the crust to thicken and scrunch. Tectonic forces lifted the mountains and peninsula out of the water, forming a valley that was cut off from the ocean to the north and the west. The rest of Alaska&#x27;s mountains were formed in the same manner, in cyclic events, and the mountain ranges become progressively older the further north they lie. Thus, the Cook Inlet and its surrounding land masses are rather young compared to those of the Alaska Range, which formed around 126 million years ago, or the Brooks Range which formed around 256 million years ago. The valley left by this continental compaction remains open to the Gulf of Alaska to the south, forming the inlet as it exists today. The surrounding mountains were host the large ice sheets and glaciers during the Pleistocene epoch (the Ice Ages, around 2 million to 11,000 years ago) which scoured the land and formed vast plains and moraines surrounding much of the upper inlet from glacial till that was deposited.

Cook Inlet exists in a subsidence zone which contains many faults, and is frequently prone to earthquake activity. The primary fault, the Aleutian Fault, is found in the nearby Aleutian Trench in the Gulf of Alaska, where a corner of the Pacific Plate is forced underneath Alaska at a 45-degree angle. Thus, most of the uplift force occurs along a line from Kodiak Island and up the Kenai Mountains to the Chugach mountains. The inlet lies in a region where the crust is wrinkled under this force and the tectonic forces push the ground downward. In 1964, the 1964 Alaska earthquake, a megathrust earthquake, occurred when over 600 miles of the Aleutian fault ruptured, uplifting the Kenai Mountains 60 feet (20 meters) in under 5 minutes. With a magnitude of 9.2, the earthquake was the fourth largest ever recorded. It devastated Anchorage where much of downtown dropped several stories, and the mountains surrounding the Turnagain Arm subsided 8 feet (2.4 meters), submerging the towns of Portage and Girdwood, as well as long stretches of the Seward Highway. 
Because it lies along a subduction zone, the Cook Inlet region contains active volcanoes, including Augustine Volcano and Mount Redoubt, and is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. Hot magma and steam from the subducting ocean floor build up within these volcanoes, which tend to erupt in fairly regular cycles with very explosive force, often spewing volcanic ash tens of thousands of feet (several kilometers) high. Volcanic eruptions in the region have been associated with earthquakes and tsunamis, and debris avalanches have resulted in tsunamis also. There was an earthquake of the magnitude of 7.1 on December 31, 1901 generated by an eruption that caused several tsunamis. In 2009 a lahar from Mt. Redoubt threatened the Drift River oil terminal.

Cook Inlet has the fourth largest tidal range in the world. The shape of the inlet and its orientation with respect to the lunar orbit causes the tide to come in and go out very rapidly. As the inlet narrows, the speed of the water increases, creating very powerful currents with speeds of up to 6 knots (7 miles per hour). While lined with large areas of silt and mudflats, the central and upper inlet is filled with narrow troughs that may be 150 to 300 feet (50 to 100 meters) deep. These, along with the tides, provide a challenge to ships navigating through the waters. The strong tides create powerful rip tides and bore tides which are sometimes among the largest in the world. Tidal bores occur within the inlet, and especially Turnagain Arm, almost daily, but are usually too small to notice. Large bores tend to occur after extreme tidal lows, appearing as a wall of water sometimes over 10 feet high as the tide comes in all at once. Large bores are less frequent, and are typically formed during a new or full moon, especially when the moon is at perigee. Unlike areas around the Bering Sea where weather is largely affected by sea ice, the waters of the inlet are warmed by the Alaska Current in the Gulf of Alaska, part of the North-Pacific Subpolar Gyre, which affects the climate and keeps the temperatures in the Cook Inlet region fairly moderate compared to the extremes found in other parts of the state.

==History==

The inlet was first explored and settled by Alutiiq people, tribes of coastal-dwelling Pacific Eskimos, beginning around 6000 years ago. The Chugach arrived around the first century and were the last of the Alutiiq people to settle in the area, but abandoned it after tribes of Dena&#x27;ina people, an Athabaskan people from the interior of the state, arrived sometime between 500 and 1600 AD. In the 18th century, Russian fur hunters &quot;(promyshlenniki)&quot; were among the first European visitors. The Lebedev Lastochkin Company leader Stepan Zaikov established a post at the mouth of the Kenai River, Fort Nikolaevskaia, in 1786. These fur trappers used Siberian Native and Alaska Native people, particularly Aleuts from the Aleutian Islands and Koniag natives from Kodiak, to hunt for sea otters and other marine mammal species for trade with China via Russia&#x27;s then-exclusive inland port of trade at Kiakhta.

Other Europeans to visit Cook Inlet include the 1778 expedition of James Cook, its namesake, who sailed into it while searching for the Northwest Passage. Cook received maps of Alaska, the Aleutians, and Kamchatka during a visit with Russian fur trader Gerasim Izmailov in Unalaska, and combined these maps with those of his expedition to create the first Mercator projection of the North Pacific. The inlet was named after Cook in 1794 by George Vancouver, who had served under Cook in 1778. Turnagain Arm was named by Cook, &quot;turnagain&quot; being a moniker he had used before, at his annoyance at having to turn around after exploring another dead end. 

Upon reaching the head of Cook Inlet, Cook was of the opinion that both Knik Arm and Turnagain Arm were the mouths of rivers and not the opening to the Northwest Passage. Under orders by the British Crown to ignore any such rivers and inlets, he had initially planned to pass it by, but at the insistence of John Gore and many others of his crew, he reluctantly agreed to explore the area. Cook anchored at Ship Creek and encountered the local Natives for the first time when two men approached in kayaks, invited them to come ashore. Under Cook&#x27;s orders, William Bligh, of fame, organized a party to travel up Knik Arm. Bligh served as Cook&#x27;s Sailing Master on this, his 3rd and final voyage, the aim of which was discovery of the Northwest Passage. After meeting with some local Dena&#x27;ina, Bligh returned to report Knik Arm indeed led only to a couple of rivers.

Cook sailed up Turnagain Arm in his ship, , finding it impossible to navigate against the strong currents and mudflats, and got stuck on a sandbar when he tried to get back out, having to wait for the tide to come in and free his ship. He never actually confirmed it led to a river, which led to a decade of massive speculation until George Vancouver returned to finish the map. Having been in a bad mood since first agreeing to explore the area, and as a result of this frustration, the second body of water was given the disingenuous name &quot;Turn Again&quot;. Early maps label Turnagain Arm as the &quot;Turnagain River&quot;.
The SS &quot;Farallon&quot; was a wooden Alaskan Steamship Company liner that struck Black Reef in the Cook Inlet on January 5, 1910. All thirty-eight men on board survived, and were rescued twenty-nine days later. Few white people visited upper Cook Inlet until construction of the Alaska Railroad along the eastern shores of Turnagain Arm and Knik Arm of Cook Inlet around 1915. The natives of the Eklutna village are the descendants of the residents of eight native villages around upper Cook Inlet.

During the 1964 Alaska earthquake, areas around the head of Turnagain Arm near Girdwood and Portage dropped as much as by subsidence and subsequent tidal action. Both hamlets were destroyed. Girdwood was later relocated inland and Portage was abandoned. About of the Seward Highway sank below the high-water mark of Turnagain Arm; the highway and its bridges were raised and rebuilt in 1964–66.

==Communities==
Most of Alaska&#x27;s population is in the Cook Inlet area, with highest concentration in Anchorage. Along the East side of the Cook Inlet, the Kenai Peninsula is host to many smaller fishing communities, such as Kenai, Soldotna, Ninilchick, Anchor Point and Homer. Many residents of the Kenai rely on income generated from fisheries in the Cook Inlet. The west side of the Inlet is not connected to any major road systems and is typically accessed by boat or plane, including the village of Tyonek, Alaska, some oil camps, and many seasonal fishing camps.

==Resources==

The Cook Inlet Basin contains large oil and gas deposits including several offshore fields. As of 2005 there were 16 platforms in Cook Inlet, the oldest of which is the &quot;XTO A&quot; platform first installed by Shell in 1964, and newest of which is the &quot;Osprey&quot; platform installed by Forest Oil in 2000. Most of the platforms are operated by Union Oil, which was acquired by Chevron in 2005. There are also numerous oil and gas pipelines running around and under the Cook Inlet. The main destinations of the gas pipelines are to Kenai where the gas is primarily used to fuel commercial fertilizer production and a liquified natural gas (LNG) plant and to Anchorage where the gas is consumed largely for domestic uses.

Alaska has approximately half the known coal reserves in the U.S. For decades, there has been a proposal to build a large coal mine (the Chuitna Coal Mine) on the west side of Cook Inlet near the Chuitna River, and the native village of Tyonek, Alaska. American Rivers placed the Chuitna River on its list of America&#x27;s Ten Most Endangered Rivers of 2007, based on the threat of this mine.
Turnagain Arm is one of only about 60 bodies of water worldwide to exhibit a tidal bore. The bore may be more than high and travel at on high spring tides and opposing winds. Turnagain Arm sees the largest tidal range in United States, with a mean of , and the fourth highest in the world, behind Bay of Fundy (), Ungava Bay (), and Bristol Channel (). The ocean&#x27;s natural 12-hour 25-minute tidal cycle is close to Turnagain Arm&#x27;s natural resonance frequency, which then reinforces the tide similar to water sloshing in a bathtub. Tidal fluctuations in the main body of Cook Inlet, while not as extreme as the shallow and narrow Turnagain Arm, regularly reach or more and exhibit currents in excess of at full tidal flow. The inlet and its arms have been proposed as a potentially attractive site for the generation of tidal power.
Turnagain Arm and Knik Arm are known for large areas of silt. At low tide, much of this is exposed, making marine navigation difficult. Historically, ships and boats designed for the area had a relatively flat bottom with a modest centerboard and absence of a large keel because the boats would occasionally become beached at low tide either on purpose or by accident. This design allowed the craft to support its weight on land without sustaining any serious damage to its structure. An example of this design is the Nomad, a much photographed fishing boat once owned by Joe Reddington which has sat on a mudflat near Knik for several decades.

These mudflats can also be dangerous to walk on, exhibiting quicksand-like characteristics, and have claimed the life of at least four people who have wandered out on them, usually tourists, with many more being rescued every year.

Cruise ships dock at Seward on the Gulf of Alaska or Whittier in Prince William Sound and transport passengers via bus or train to Anchorage. However, over 95% of freight entering Alaska comes through the Port of Anchorage, which is served by major container ship companies and other carriers.

==Conservation==
The Cook Inlet beluga whale is a genetically distinct and geographically isolated stock. The population fell to 278 in 2005 and it is listed as critically endangered in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This was perhaps due to local hunt, although an article in the &quot;Anchorage Daily News&quot; questioned this conclusion. Killer whales commonly feed on belugas in the Cook Inlet, driving them to the upper part of the inlet where they often seek refuge in the shallower waters of the arms.

In 2000, the US National Marine Fisheries Service listed the Cook Inlet beluga whale population as depleted and began development of a conservation plan. On October 22, 2008 the Cook Inlet beluga whale was put onto the endangered species list. Cook Inlet activities include commercial fishing, oil and gas development, release of treated sewage, noise from aircraft and ships, shipping traffic, and tourism. However, it is not known what impact these activities had on the beluga whale population.

The Coastal Marine Institute at the University of Alaska Fairbanks&#x27;s School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences working with the U.S. Department of the Interior&#x27;s Minerals Management Service (MMS), began a three-year project in 2003 focusing on the water circulation in Cook Inlet.

Cook Inletkeeper, a member of the Waterkeeper Alliance, began in 1994 when a group of Alaskans became concerned about the rapid ecological changes in the inlet. The group formally incorporated the following year using settlement proceeds from a Clean Water Act lawsuit against Cook Inlet oil and gas producers. Their stated mission is to &quot;protect Alaska&#x27;s Cook Inlet watershed and the life it sustains,&quot; with a focus on clean water, healthy habitat, local economies, and energy. They are based in Homer.

<text>Central Canada (, sometimes the &quot;Central provinces&quot;) is a Canadian region consisting of Ontario and Quebec, the largest and most populous provinces of the country. Geographically, they are not at the centre of Canada but instead overlap with Eastern Canada toward the east. Because of their large populations, Ontario and Quebec have traditionally held a significant amount of political power in Canada, leading to some amount of resentment from other regions of the country. Before Confederation, the term &quot;Canada&quot; specifically referred to Central Canada. Today, the term &quot;Central Canada&quot; is less often used than the names of the individual provinces.

==History==

Before Confederation, the region known as Canada was what is now called Central Canada. Southern Ontario was once called Upper Canada and later Canada West, and southern Quebec was called Lower Canada and later Canada East. Both were part of the United Province of Canada in 1841.

== Geography ==
Ontario, Canada&#x27;s fourth largest subdivision (after Nunavut, Quebec, and the Northwest Territories), had, at the 2021 Canadian census, a land area of (10.15 per cent of Canada and the fifth largest after Nunavut, Quebec, the Northwest Territories, and British Columbia) and as of 2017, there was (21.55 per cent of Canada and the second largest after Quebec) of fresh water, for a total area of (11.13 per cent of Canada).

Quebec, Canada&#x27;s second largest subdivision and largest province, had, at the 2021 Canadian census, a land area of (14.78 per cent of Canada and the second largest after Nunavut), and as of 2017, there was (22.34 per cent and the largest in Canada) of fresh water, for a total area of (15.42 per cent of Canada).

Together the two provinces have a land area of (24.93 per cent), (43.89 per cent) fresh water for a total area of (26.55 per cent).

Although the region is called Central Canada the actual centre of Canada can be defined in multiple ways. The longitudinal centre of Canada is located just east of Winnipeg, Manitoba, on Highway 1 East, part of the Trans-Canada Highway. The latitudinal centre is at 62 degrees, 24 minutes north, meaning the geographic centre of Canada is located just south of Yathkyed Lake, Nunavut.

== Population ==
Ontario and Quebec are the two most populous provinces in Canada, accounting for 61.43 per cent of Canada&#x27;s population. As of the 2021 census conducted by Statistics Canada there were 22,725,775 people in the two provinces, and represented an increase of 5.1 per cent over the 2016 census figure of 21,612,855 people. The land area was giving a population density of .

The median age of Ontario was 41.6, identical to Canada as a whole, and Quebec&#x27;s population was slightly older at 43.2.

They are represented in the House of Commons of Canada by 199 Members of Parliament (Ontario: 121, Quebec: 78) out of a total of 338. The southern portions of the two provinces — particularly the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor — are the most urbanized and industrialized areas of Canada, containing the country&#x27;s two largest cities, Toronto and Montreal, the national capital, Ottawa, and the National Capital Region.

As of the 2021 census Statistics Canada lists 24 Census Metropolitan Areas (CMA) in Central Canada. They include Ottawa - Gatineau as well as Ottawa - Gatineau (Ontario part) and Ottawa - Gatineau (Quebec part). All CMAs in Quebec are located the southern part of the province. In Ontario, with the exception of Greater Sudbury / Grand Sudbury and Thunder Bay, which are in Northern Ontario, all CMAs are in Southern Ontario. The CMAs are listed here by population count:

<doc id="413571" wikidata="Q2508154" url="?curid=413571" title="Virginia State Route 267">
<text>State Route 267 (SR 267) is an expressway in the US state of Virginia. It consists of two end-to-end toll roads – the Dulles Toll Road and Dulles Greenway – as well as the non-tolled Dulles Access Road, which lies in the median of Dulles Toll Road and then extends east to Falls Church. The combined roadway provides a toll road for commuting and a free road for access to Washington Dulles International Airport. The three sections are operated and maintained by separate agencies: Dulles Toll Road and Dulles Access Road are maintained by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA); the Dulles Greenway is owned by TRIP II, a limited partnership, but is maintained by Atlas Arteria, an Australian company which owns the majority stake in the partnership. The Dulles Access Road&#x27;s median hosts the Silver Line of the Washington Metro between the airport and Tysons.

==Dulles Access Road==
The Dulles Access Road is a four-lane, highway that runs between the westbound and eastbound roadways of the Dulles Toll Road, along the latter&#x27;s median. As this road is exclusively used for entering and exiting Dulles Airport, there are no general-access exits from the westbound lanes, and no general-access entrances to the eastbound lanes, with the exception of gated slip ramps to and from the toll road that buses and emergency vehicles can use, and it is free of charge to use. The Access Road was built from the Beltway as part of the construction of Dulles Airport, and opened with the airport in 1962. It was extended to I-66 in 1985.

Until 2006, the Dulles Access Road was operated by the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) under contract with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, the owner of the land under both the Access Road and the Dulles Toll Road, and has the unsigned designation of State Route 90004. 
Since the opening of the Dulles Toll Road, the only major modification to the Access Road has been the construction of the Silver Line inside the median, and the construction of a flyover exit ramp from the eastbound Access Road to State Route 7. This ramp bypasses congestion associated with the main toll plaza, where traffic from Dulles Airport attempts to exit at Route 7.
===Restrictions on use and violations===
The Dulles Airport Access Road can be used only for travel to and from Dulles Airport and other businesses (such as air freight, hotels, and gas stations) on the airport grounds. Although it is illegal to use the Access Road without conducting such &quot;airport business,&quot; some commuters evade the toll and the traffic on the Toll Road by taking the Access Road to the airport, then &quot;backtracking&quot; to their exit. For a couple of years prior to the opening of the Dulles Toll Road, VDOT issued special stickers allowing commuters (for a fee) to backtrack legally along the access highway, but these were discontinued when the toll road opened. Drivers can receive a fine and driver&#x27;s license violations for using the Dulles Access Road illegally. Revenue from the fines is given to the county in which the fine is issued.

==Dulles Toll Road==

The Dulles Toll Road is an eight-lane, toll road that runs outside the Dulles Access Road.

===History===
In response to the development along the Dulles Access Road and the number of motorists who backtracked through the airport to commute to outer suburbs, the Virginia Department of Transportation determined a need for a limited access highway to serve points along the Access Road without subjecting airport traffic to congestion. It was built in 1984 by the Virginia Department of Transportation as a toll highway, because conventional funding was not available. The toll road begins just inside the Capital Beltway near West Falls Church at a connector to Interstate 66 to Washington, D.C., travels westward through Fairfax County past Dulles, and terminates at the entrance to the Dulles Greenway, a privately owned toll road that is a continuation of Route 267. Officially, the road is named the Omer L. Hirst – Adelard L. Brault Expressway, in honor of two Virginia state legislators. However, the road is rarely referred to by that name. The speed limit is , and the original construction had two lanes in each direction. 

A third lane was built to serve HOV traffic in 1992. For a short period between the end of construction and the start of HOV limits, drivers of single passenger vehicles used the lane and contacted government officials opposing the HOV policy. In response, Congress (which did not have direct control over the highway) passed special legislation prohibiting the imposition of HOV restrictions on the route. As a compromise to resolve the situation, Virginia decided to lift the HOV restriction and to construct a fourth lane in each direction to serve HOV traffic. However, unlike the third lane, officials did not allow non-HOV use at the end of construction in 1998, and avoided a repeat of the controversy. As a practical matter, the right of way could not fit any additional lanes other than the current six in each direction. However, Rep. Frank Wolf again threatened to pass federal legislation prohibiting the fourth lane to be limited to HOV traffic.

In 2005, five companies submitted proposals to VDOT to privatize the toll road which included payments to Virginia that could be used for transportation. In response MWAA made its own proposal to take over operation of the toll road from VDOT, assuming associated debts, and commit to building a rapid transit line in the median. VDOT agreed and, on March 27, 2006, MWAA took over from Virginia the operation of the Dulles Toll Road, including the outstanding debt and the obligation to construct the Silver Line in the median strip of the toll road. The first phase of the Silver Line (east of Reston) opened in July 2014, while the second phase (west of Reston) opened in November 2022.

===Description===

From the Beltway, motorists exiting onto SR 267 toward Dulles Airport must choose between lanes marked &quot;Airport Traffic Only&quot; and &quot;To All Local Exits&quot;; the &quot;Airport Traffic Only&quot; lanes lead to the two westbound lanes of the Access Road. Eastbound traffic is routed differently; Dulles-originating traffic can choose destinations between Herndon exits (putting them on the mainline Toll Road) or further on (starting them on the Access Road), and transfer exits are provided from the Access Road to the Toll Road before the Herndon exits, Reston exits, and the Beltway. Access Road traffic to State Route 7 gets a separate exit ramp from those of the Toll Road, and then the two eastbound segments merge before the junction with Interstate 66.

Through December 31, 2013, a main toll plaza west of the Beltway interchange collects a $1.75 toll in both directions for two-axle vehicles. Toll booths located on westbound exit ramps and eastbound entrance ramps collect tolls of $1.00, except at the Route 7 interchange, where tolls are only collected from Route 267 east to Route 7 east. Vehicles with more than two axles are charged higher rates. All tollbooths are equipped with electronic toll collection systems which accept E-ZPass or a compatible system. Fifty cents of each toll is attributable to the financing of the Silver Line to Dulles Airport. On November 14, 2012, the MWAA Board of Directors voted to increase the toll by 25¢ (from $1.50 to $1.75 at the main toll plaza and from 75¢ to $1.00 at the ramp toll booths) effective January 1, 2013; and to increase the toll by an additional 75¢ to $2.50 at the main toll plaza effective January 1, 2014. The 2013 and 2014 toll increases primarily help pay for Phase 1 Silver Line Metrorail construction costs.
HOV-2 restrictions are in effect during weekday rush hours, 6:30 to 9:00 am eastbound and 4:00 to 6:30 pm westbound, limiting the left lane to vehicles with two or more passengers between State Route 28 and the main toll plaza. Motorcycles and approved clean fuel vehicles displaying a Clean Special Fuel license plate are exempt from this rule, meaning single passenger vehicles of this nature may use the left lane. Traditional hybrid vehicles such as the Toyota Prius that do not plug in are no longer exempt from HOV rules. During rush hour, the appropriate directions of Interstate 66 between the Beltway and U.S. Route 29 just outside Washington are toll roads. Single-passenger vehicles bound to or from the airport using the Dulles Access Road must pay tolls using an E-ZPass. Vehicles with 2 or more people may switch their E-ZPass Flex into HOV mode to avoid being charged for tolls. These regulations are enforced by the Virginia State Police.

==Dulles Greenway==

The Dulles Greenway is a privately owned toll road in Northern Virginia, running for 12.53 miles (20.17 km) northwest from the end of the Dulles Toll Road to the Leesburg Bypass (U.S. Route 15/State Route 7). 
The northbound side of the freeway leads directly onto US-15 North at its termination, thus forming a continuous route towards Frederick, MD and beyond. Although privately owned, the highway is also part of SR 267. The speed limit is .

The road was privately built and is not a public asset. The current owner is &quot;Toll Road Investors Partnership II&quot; (TRIP II), which was a consortium of the Bryant/Crane Family LLC, the Franklin L. Haney Co., and Kellogg Brown &amp; Root (KB&amp;R). On August 31, 2005, Australian firm Macquarie Infrastructure Group (now Atlas Arteria) announced that they had paid $533 million to TRIP II to acquire its 86.7% ownership of the Greenway, and were negotiating with KB&amp;R for the remaining ownership rights. Initially, as the road was built as a &quot;Design Build Finance Operate Maintain&quot; (DBFOM) project, the responsibility for operating the road was scheduled to revert to Virginia in 2036 via a concession agreement. In 2001, The Virginia State Corporation Commission extended this period to the year 2056.

===History===

The road was envisioned as early as the 1970s, when new residents were attracted to Loudoun County because of the relatively low cost of real estate. The Greenway proposal prompted the enactment of the Virginia Highway Corporation Act of 1988 that authorizes the construction of new toll roads without the use of eminent domain under rates set by the Virginia Corporation Commission. The law requires the facility to be turned over to the state after a stated time period. The road was completed and opened in 1995, but the original owners defaulted on its loan due to lower than projected use. It receives no public funds, was built with no subsidies, and is policed at its own expense, competing as a wholly private enterprise with the state-built and -maintained roads. Tolls are computed to assure that the owner will recover the original investment plus a return on that investment. The losses incurred during the early years of the project are rolled forward to justify higher tolls in later years. Subsequent improvements, which were constructed in exchange for the aforementioned extension of the toll road to 2056, include adding a third lane in each direction, resurfacing the entire road in 2009, and the construction of an improved eastbound exit ramp to Dulles Airport in 2009.

===Description===
The main toll plaza for the Dulles Greenway is located just west of the exits for Route 28 and Dulles Airport. Additional toll plazas are located on westbound entrance ramps and eastbound exit ramps with the exception of Battlefield Parkway (Exit 2) in Leesburg. The toll varies depending on the toll plaza traversed. , the base toll collected for two-axle vehicles ranges from $3.00 ($2.55 with E-ZPass) at the Shreve Mill Rd plaza to $5.10 at the main plaza to and from the Dulles Toll Road (which includes the $1.00 toll for the Dulles Toll Road). Vehicles with more than two axles are charged higher rates. The maximum toll rises to $5.90 (including the 75¢ Dulles Toll Road toll) during congestion pricing hours, which are 6:30 am to 9:00 am eastbound and 4:00 pm to 6:30 pm westbound. A previous increase in the base fare and the introduction of congestion pricing occurred in January 2009, and tolls rose an additional 30 cents per trip on January 1, 2012. Vehicles traveling through the main toll plaza to or from the Dulles Toll Road are charged two tolls: one for the Dulles Toll Road, and one for the Dulles Greenway. Cash tolls are accepted during limited hours, and credit cards and E-ZPass transponder payments are accepted at all times.

The Greenway is also one of two routes where a subscription membership (exclusive to E-ZPass) allows for an additional discount. Alternate (free) routes include State Route 7 and State Route 28, both of which are generally more congested.

The Greenway was later widened to six lanes from the mainline toll plaza to Leesburg. Use of the Greenway has grown, reflecting the increased population of Loudoun County. In 1996, the Greenway served 6.3 million trips, growing to 21 million in 2006. However, for the first three months following the January 2009 toll increase, usage dropped 8% compared to the first three months of 2008.

===Controversies===
The 1988 statute authorizing the private toll road permitted toll increases above the rate of inflation under a three-part test: (1) the new fee must not &quot;materially discourage&quot; drivers from using the road, (2) the company must not make more than a &quot;reasonable rate of return&quot; from the increase, and (3) the road&#x27;s benefit must match its cost. Critics claim that the drop in use following the 2009 toll increase is evidence that the test has not been met. Representative Frank Wolf, the Congressman representing the area served by the road, stated, &quot;It&#x27;s highway robbery. It&#x27;s a disgrace. Everyone knows that these tolls are ripping people off and there&#x27;s not much we can do about it.&quot;

==Exit list==
===Dulles Toll Road and Dulles Greenway===
SR 267 uses sequential exit numbering rather than the distance-based exit numbering used throughout most of Virginia.

<text>María Josefa Gabriela Cariño de Silang (; March 19, 1731 – September 20, 1763) was a Filipino military leader best known for her role as the female leader of the Ilocano independence movement from Spain. She took over from her second husband Diego Silang after his assassination in 1763, leading her people for four months before she was captured and executed by the colonial government of the Captaincy General of the Philippines.

==Early life==
Gabriela Silang was born in barrio Caniogan, Santa, Ilocos to a Spanish Ilocano father named Anselmo Cariño, a trader who ferried his wares from Vigan to Abra along the Abra River and a descendant of Ignacio Cariño, the first Galician from Spain to arrive in Candon in the late 17th century. Her mother was a Tinguian who was from a Tinguian barrio in San Quintin (now Pidigan, Abra). 

She received a Catholic upbringing from the town&#x27;s parish priest, and attained elementary level education at the town&#x27;s convent school. After being separated from her parents early in her childhood, she was raised by a priest, who eventually arranged a marriage between her and the wealthy businessman. They married in 1751, and he died three years later.

== Revolutionary involvement ==
===Relationship with her spouse, Diego Silang===
After being widowed by her first husband, Gabriela met future insurgent leader Diego Silang and married him in 1757.

In 1762, as part of what would later be known as the Seven Years&#x27; War, the Kingdom of Great Britain declared war on Spain, and captured Manila, resulting in the British occupying the city and nearby Cavite. After the capture of Manila, an emboldened Diego sought to initiate an armed struggle to overthrow Spanish functionaries in Ilocos and replace them with native-born officials. He joined forces with the British, who appointed him governor of Ilocos on their behalf. During this revolt, Gabriela became one of Diego&#x27;s closest advisors and his unofficial aide-de-camp during skirmishes with Spanish troops. She was also a major figure in her husband&#x27;s co-operation with the British.

Spanish authorities retaliated by offering a reward for Diego’s assassination. Consequently, his two former allies, Miguel Vicos and Pedro Becbec, killed him in Vigan on May 28, 1763.

===Revolutionary leadership in Tayum===
After Diego&#x27;s murder, Gabriela fled to Tayum, now part of Abra, to seek refuge in the house of her paternal uncle, Nicolás Cariño. There, she appointed her first two generals, Miguel Flores and Tagabuen Infiel. She later assumed her husband&#x27;s role as commander of the rebel troops and achieved a &quot;priestess&quot; status amongst her community and followers. Her popular image as the bolo-wielding &quot;La Generala&quot; on horseback stems from this period.

===Assault on Vigan and execution===

On September 10, 1763, Silang attempted to besiege Vigan but the Spanish retaliated, forcing her into hiding. She retreated once more to Abra, where the Spanish later captured her. On September 20, 1763, Silang and her troops were executed by hanging in Vigan&#x27;s central plaza.

==Legacy==

She is remembered as the “Joan of Arc of Ilocandia” The Order of Gabriela Silang is the sole third class national decoration awarded by the Philippines whose membership is restricted to women. The organisation and party list Gabriela Women&#x27;s Party (&quot;General Assembly Binding Women for Reforms, Integrity, Equality, Leadership, and Action&quot;), which advocates for women&#x27;s rights and issues, was founded in April 1984 in her honour. The BRP Gabriela Silang (OPV-8301) is named after her. Asteroid 7026 Gabrielasilang, discovered by Eleanor Helin at Palomar in 1993, is named in her honor. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on November 8, 2019 ().

==In popular culture==
* Silang was portrayed by Tanya Gomez in the 1996 ABS-CBN educational television series &quot;Bayani&quot; in the two-episode &quot;Gabriela Silang: Ang Alap&quot; and &quot;Diego Silang: Ang Sulat.&quot;
* Silang was portrayed by Kris Bernal in the 2013 GMA Network historical drama series &quot;Indio&quot; and by Glaiza de Castro in the GMA News TV television romance anthology &quot;Wagas&quot;.

<text>Peter Kalifornsky (October 12, 1911 – June 5, 1993) was a writer and ethnographer of the Dena&#x27;ina Athabaskan of Kenai, Alaska.

==Early life, family and education==
He was the great-grandson of Qadanalchen, who took the name Kalifornsky after working in the Russian American colony of Fort Ross in California. (Kalifornsky, Alaska was named for him.)

==Career==
Kalifornsky wrote traditional stories, poems, and language lessons in the Outer Inlet dialect (sometimes called the Kenai dialect) of Dena&#x27;ina, a language of the Athabaskan language group. As a Dena&#x27;ina elder, Kalifornsky participated in creating the written version of the Dena&#x27;ina language. Over 19 years, he worked to record as many &quot;sukdu&quot; (traditional stories) as he could remember, translating them also into English. He also wrote original works in Dena&#x27;ina, including a number of autobiographical works.

Near the end of his life, he worked with linguist James Kari of the Alaska Native Language Center and anthropologist Alan Boraas of Kenai Peninsula College to compile his collected works. Published in 1991, &quot;A Dena&#x27;ina Legacy — K&#x27;tl&#x27;egh&#x27;i Sukdu: The Collected Writings of Peter Kalifornsky&quot; contains 147 bilingual Dena&#x27;ina-English writings. Throughout most of the volume, the original Dena&#x27;ina appears on the left-hand page and the English translation appears opposite, on the right page.

==Works by Peter Kalifornsky==

This bibliography is based upon &quot;Kalifornskyana,&quot; the bibliography of Kalifornsky&#x27;s works included in &quot;A Dena&#x27;ina Legacy.&quot; However, the bibliography has been reordered and citations are rendered in a different citation style. As with the original bibliography, materials not included in &quot;A Dena&#x27;ina Legacy&quot; are marked with a cross † — here placed after the date.

<doc id="413592" wikidata="Q972905" url="?curid=413592" title="Léon Goossens">
<text>Léon Jean Goossens, CBE, FRCM (12 June 1897 – 13 February 1988) was an English oboist.

==Career==
Goossens was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, and studied at Liverpool College of Music and the Royal College of Music. His father was violinist and conductor Eugène Goossens, his brother the conductor and composer Eugene Aynsley Goossens and his sisters the harpists Marie and Sidonie Goossens. In 1916 his brother Adolphe, a gifted French horn player, was killed in action at the Somme.

During the early and middle parts of the 20th century, he was considered among the premier oboists in the world. He joined the Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra (conducted by Henry Wood) at the age of 15 and was later (1932) engaged by Sir Thomas Beecham for the newly founded London Philharmonic Orchestra, but he also enjoyed a rich solo and chamber-music career. He became famous for a uniquely pleasing sound few other oboists could match. Oboists of the past had tended to be divided between the French school (elegant but thin and reedy in tone) and the German (full and rounded but rather clumsy, with little or no vibrato), but Goossens brought together the best qualities of both styles.

Goossens commissioned a number of works for the oboe from such distinguished composers as Sir Edward Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Rutland Boughton and collaborated extensively with other prominent soloists such as Yehudi Menuhin. Amongst his many pupils were the oboists Evelyn Barbirolli, Joy Boughton, daughter of Rutland Boughton and Peter Graeme, oboist of the Melos Ensemble.
During WW2, when Londoners found shelter from German bombs in the Tube, in the underground, Goosens was a reliable entertainer. He played so often that even a casual concert in Cornwall in 1975 filled the church and people wept, remembering the comfort of his solo playing below ground and into the morning, before the all clear.
He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1950 and made a Fellow of the Royal College of Music in 1962. He married his second wife Lucie Leslie Burrowes in 1933 and there were three daughters: Benedicta, Jennie (an actress) and Corinne.

<text>Gobeunok or Gogok are comma-shaped or curved beads and jewels that appeared from middle age of Mumun Period ( 850 to 550 BC ) through the Three Kingdoms of Korea (57 BC to 668 AD). The &quot;Gogok&quot; (곡옥; 曲玉) is posited by researchers to have been a symbol of prestige among Mumun culture community leaders as the tombs of presumably powerful figures were oftentimes accompanied by bronze daggers, stone daggers, and comma-shaped jewels. The Gogok&#x27;s role as a symbol of prestige would carry onto the Three Kingdoms Period of Korea (as Gogok would remain a salient feature of Korean royal paraphernalia (Silla and Baekje). They range in size range from , and are oftentimes fashioned with a hole to be attached or threaded to another object. The origin of these comma-shaped jewels are posited by some to originate from the dragon-shaped jadeite ornament of the Hongshan culture (4,500 to 3,000 BC) of the Liao River Basin. However, due to the spatial and temporal distance, most researchers have been skeptical of their genealogical relationship. The generally accepted interpretation in academia is that the form of the comma-shaped jewel originated from the canine teeth of predator animals such as the Magatama of Japan from the late Jōmon period (approximately 1,000 BC) or as a symbol of a half-moon sacred to moon worshippers, or as a symbol of fetus and or fertility.

==History==

===Mumun Korea===
The Gogok jewel is first found on the Korean peninsula during the Middle Mumun Period (850 to 550 BC) in which they have been unearthed from the graves of elites throughout the southern part of the peninsula. The Cist tomb #1 at Songguk-ni—in reference to the Bronze Age rounded pit dwellings of Korea—dated to 800–700 BC has revealed an impressive array of elite grave goods consisting of a lute-shaped bronze dagger and chisel, a polished stone dagger, 11 willow leaf-shaped polished stone arrowheads, 17 tubular beads, and two comma-shaped amazonite stones. These grave goods were typically found in positions where they were originally placed with or worn by the tomb-bearer. For instance, the Cist tomb #1 of the Songguk-ni site had a bronze dagger placed next to the tomb-bearer&#x27;s left hand. The two comma-shaped ornaments were found on each side of the dagger tip suggested that they had been a decoration element of the now decomposed sheath. The tubular beads were scattered around the dagger between its midpoint and tip. Meanwhile, the stone dagger lay at the waist of the tomb-bearer with its tip pointing towards the feet suggesting that it was attached to the waist of the user. The comma-shaped ornaments were made of amazonite while the tubular bead ere made of jasper and amber while the small circular beads were made of amazonite, crystal or amber. This cist tomb—containing certain jade ornaments (Gogok jewels and tubular beads) and bronze tools—is believed to have belonged to the highest-ranking leaders of this particular Songguk-ni community as its contents align with the general elite paraphernalia of the Middle Mumun Period. Bronze mirrors would be added to this list of elite goods during the Late Mumun Period (550–300 BC).

These comma-shaped amazonite ornaments alongside their tubular and circular bead counterparts have been found in other cist tombs as well as Neolithic and Bronze Age dolmens (Usan-ni in Seungju, Pyeonggeo-dong in Yeosu, Weol&#x27;am-ni in Muan, and Daepyeong-ni in Jinju). They have also been found in Middle Mumun residential remains (Jodong-ni in Chungju and Changpyeong-ni in Ulsan). In addition to the widespread excavation of comma-shaped jewels in Mumun sites across southern Korea, between 1995 and 1999, archeologists excavating the Daepyeong-ni Mumun village have discovered several industrial locations where tubular beads of jasper and comma-shaped amazonite ornaments were manufactured. The artifacts unearthed at these production locations consisted of finished and unfinished ornaments, raw materials, and grinding tools. On the basis of site analysis at Daepyeong-ni, Shinya Shoda and his team of researchers have concluded that the production of these prestige jade goods were carried out by the community through two specialized groups located at two different sections within the community to enhance efficiency: the eastern section would provide raw materials and roughly cut stone silhouettes while the western section would create the finished product.
===Three Kingdoms Period===
The Gogok of the Three Kingdoms period were commonly used as earrings and necklaces, and as decoration on crowns, belts, and bracelets. At this time, the material which the ornament was constructed from became increasingly more refined with some even being decorated with gold or silver caps.

The most famous examples of Gogok in Korean art are from the Three Kingdoms period, in the crowns of Silla, earrings, necklaces, and royal girdle of Korea. These treasures were found in the burial mounds and royal mausoleums of Silla, Baekje, and Gaya confederacy. Archaeological evidence suggests that &quot;Those Gogok&quot; were produced in specific areas of Japan as Magatama and were widely dispersed throughout the Japanese archipelago to the Southern Koreanic kingdoms via trade routes.

<doc id="413614" wikidata="Q641147" url="?curid=413614" title="Philip Christoph von Königsmarck">
<text>[[Count]] Philip Christoph von Königsmarck (4 March 1665 – 2 July 1694), also spelled Philipp, was a Swedish count and soldier. He was allegedly the lover of Sophia Dorothea, Princess of Celle, the wife of Duke George Louis of Brunswick and Lüneburg, the heir presumptive of the Principality of Calenberg, later to become Elector of Hanover (as George I Louis, 1708) and King of Great Britain (as George I, 1714).

==Background==

Königsmarck was born in Stade. He was the grandson of the Swedish Field Marshal Hans Christoff von Königsmarck, Bremen-Verden&#x27;s governor general in Stade, and nephew to the Swedish Field Marshal Otto Wilhelm Königsmarck and Beata Elisabet von Königsmarck. He was the son of Count Kurt Christoph von Königsmarck (1634-1673), son of Hans Christoff von Königsmarck, and Countess Maria Christina von Wrangel (1628-1691), daughter of Count Herman Wrangel. 

His sister Maria Aurora of Königsmarck was later mistress to Augustus II the Strong of Poland, with whom she had the son Maurice de Saxe, the brilliant French military commander. His other sister Amalia Wilhelmina was a noted dilettante artist. 

His brother Karl Johann von Königsmarck is alleged to have hired three assassins to kill Thomas Thynne – husband of heiress Elizabeth Seymour, Duchess of Somerset, whom Königsmarck had been wooing – on 12 February 1681. The assassins were hanged on 10 March 1682, though their alleged hirer was acquitted.

==Disappearance==

After wandering and fighting in various parts of Europe he entered the service of Ernest Augustus, Elector of Hanover. Here he made the acquaintance of Sophia Dorothea, and assisted her in one or two futile attempts to escape from her husband in Hanover. He is remembered as the lover of the princess, due to the large number of love letters that are now preserved at the University of Lund. On the morning of 2 July 1694, after a meeting with Sophia at the Leineschloss castle, Königsmark was seized and disappeared.

It is presumed that he was murdered in Hanover at the instigation of George Louis, and that his body was disposed of in the Leine river upon which the Leineschloss is situated. It is alleged that two of those involved in his death made confessions years later. In August 2016 bones were found under the Leineschloss castle during a renovation project; it was believed that these bones were the remains of Königsmarck. However, subsequent tests proved that some of the bones were from animals, while the human bones came from at least five different skeletons. None have been proved to belong to Königsmarck.

==Publication of purported love letters==

Most of the letters alleged to have passed between Königsmarck and Sophia Dorothea were published by William Henry Wilkins in &quot;The Love of an Uncrowned Queen&quot; (2 parts, 1900). The majority of the letters are now in the possession of Lund University in Sweden, although a few ended up in the possession of Sophia Dorothea&#x27;s grandson, King Frederick the Great of Prussia, after his sister, the Swedish Queen consort Louisa Ulrika, allegedly stole them and sent them to him. Today it is now known that the letters between the two are authentic beyond any doubt. 

==In popular culture==

Königsmarck featured in Helen de Guerry Simpson&#x27;s 1935 novel &quot;Saraband for Dead Lovers&quot; and the 1948 film of the same name and A. E. W. Mason&#x27;s 1938 novel &quot;Königsmarck&quot;. 

The 1948 costume historical romantic film, &quot;Saraband for Dead Lovers&quot; (called &quot;Saraband&quot; in the U.S.) starring Stewart Granger, Joan Greenwood, Peter Bull, Flora Robson, and Anthony Quayle and directed by Basil Dearden is based on the story.

<text>The national flag of Algeria () consists of two equal vertical bars, green and white, charged in the center with a red star and crescent, a symbol of Islam as the nation&#x27;s prominent faith. The flag was adopted on 3 July 1962. A similar version was used by the Algerian government in exile from 1958 to 1962. The Western blazon is &quot;per pale vert and argent; a crescent and star gules&quot;.

==Description==
Algerian ships fly it as their ensign, except for ships of the Algerian National Navy, which use one charged with two white crossed anchors in the canton as the naval ensign. Formerly, the two crossed anchors in the canton were red.

According to algeria-un.org, cited in 1999, the features of the flag are set down precisely, being described as: 

===Construction Sheet===
==Symbolism==
The flag aims to highlight Algeria&#x27;s cultural heritage, but there are different interpretations of its elements. According to Malek Chebel, green represents Islam and white represents purity. For Pierre Lux-Wurm, green and white bring to mind the ancient banners of Islam from the time of the Prophet Muhammad, while the crescent and star can be seen as symbols of light. According to Khaled Merzouk, the green stripe represents the earth and agriculture, the white stripe represents peace and the crescent and star are symbols of Islam. The star represents the five pillars of Islam. Benjamin Stora suggests that the three colors of the flag originally represented the three countries of the Maghreb and the ideas of union.

==History==
===Middle Ages===

In the Middle Ages, various Islamic dynasties ruled in what is now Algeria and controlled different territories at different times. At that time, national flags as we understand them today were not used. It is possible to distinguish, using various sources, certain constants, such as the presence of a crescent with variable orientation and the presence of the colors red, blue and white.

===Regency of Algiers===
====Red, yellow and green flags====
Numerous Arab and French sources unanimously agree on the tricolor Algerian flag of red, green and yellow horizontal bands, raised first by the corsair then Sultan Oruç Barbarossa, the founder of the Regency of Algiers, a tributary state of the Ottoman Empire in North Africa from 1516 to 1830. The tricolor flag seemed to be raised on the main gate of Bab Azzoun in Algiers, as well as the Djenina palace, forts and other governmental buildings in Algiers, the flag also accompanied the forces of the regency in notable battles like the Algiers expedition of 1541 and the siege of Malta. It was called &quot;the victorious flag&quot; according to an arab manuscript, while some French authors branded it as &quot;insolent&quot; and &quot;terrible&quot;. It was even described by other authors as &quot;the national flag of Algiers&quot;. One variant was considered a War flag according to Bertrand Dubreuil.

==== Ottoman regent&#x27;s flags ====
====Military flags====
==== Naval flags ====
The Barbary pirates of Ottoman Algeria between the 15th and 17th century widely used flags that were emblazoned with one or more crescents. These could however vary greatly in color, with dark red, black, green and white being in use. Besides these, Algerian pirates also used various flags in plain color, such as plain black ones signalling death. Less often, Algerian flags of this time also carried other motifs, such as suns, stars and crossed swords. It is also known that city of Algiers used an orange flag with a white horizontal sword on it by the early 19th century.

===French Algeria===

French Algeria was the period of Algerian history when the country was a colony and later a part of France, for this reason the official flag was the flag of France. The French invasion began at a time when France used a solid white flag, but during the campaign, as a result of the July Revolution in metropolitan France, the tricolor was adopted, which remained in use until the independence of the Republic of Algeria in 1962. In the 19th century there was a merchant flag used on ships coming from Algeria and it was adopted after 1848, when the territories in Algeria were integrated with Metropolitan France, creates the multicolored motifs of the striped flags of the regency. The exact rules and years of use of the striped flag are unknown. The misrepresentation of the merchant flag as the main flag of French Algeria has been happening since the 19th century.

===Emirate of Abdelkader===

The Emirate of Abdelkader or Emirate of Mascara was a sovereign country founded by Abdelkader al-Jazairi with the allegiance of the people of Algeria to resist the French conquest of Algeria with its first capital at Mascara then Tagdemt after it was taken by France. 
Many flags were used in the emirate, but the most important is the green and white one used at Abdelkader&#x27;s tent. In the white center was a raised hand of Fatima drawn surrounded by the words in gold &quot;victory from Allah and the reconquest is near, and the victory by Emir Abdelkader&quot;. Copies of this flag, although different in proportions, are kept in the Emir Abdelkader Museum in Miliana

===History of the current flag===

The North African Star (ENA) Association was preserved in 1926, with Messali Hadj as its chairman, and one of its members was the grandson of the Emir Abdelkader, Khalid ibn Hashim. Since 1926, this organization has used a green flag with the words &quot;Algeria our country, Arabic our language and Islam our religion&quot;.

While there is some dispute over who exactly designed the green and white with red star and crescent symbol, Émilie Busquant, wife of the Algerian nationalist leader Messali Hadj, is generally credited as having sewed the first version of the flag in 1934.

Historian Benjamin Stora explains that it was during a meeting of the ENA, in 1934, that the colors of the flag were chosen, after which Émilie Busquant was tasked with sewing it. However, René Gallissot and Anissa Bouayed affirm that this is not the first appearance of the Algerian flag, as Algerian trade union demonstrators displayed this same flag (green and white with a red star and crescent) during the May Day parades in 1919 and 1920, in France and Algeria.
Research by historian Mohamed Ghnanèche shows that in 1940, another flag was adopted with a red star and a white crescent placed above the center. It was then transformed by the Algerian People&#x27;s Party (PPA) to its current form in 1943. According to Achour Cheurfi, the design of the current flag comes from PPA independence activists who, around 1944, commissioned a limited group to select the flag, it will be raised for the first time during demonstration in Sétif. During these events, this is carried, among others, by Bouzid Saâl, a student who will later be killed by the French police.

The green and white flag marked with a star and a red crescent was adopted by the National Liberation Front (FLN), which led the fight against France and was subsequently adopted in 1958 by the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic. It was raised at the Monrovia Conference in August 1959, where it was officially recognized by several African countries. It is then formalized and standardized by the law of April 25, 1963.

<doc id="413617" wikidata="Q3858" url="?curid=413617" title="Music of Israel">
<text>The music of Israel is a combination of Jewish and non-Jewish music traditions that have come together over the course of a century to create a distinctive musical culture. For almost 150 years, musicians have sought original stylistic elements that would define the emerging national spirit. In addition to creating an Israeli style and sound, Israel&#x27;s musicians have made significant contributions to classical, jazz, pop rock and other international music genres. Since the 1970s, there has been a flowering of musical diversity, with Israeli rock, folk and jazz musicians creating and performing extensively, both locally and abroad. Many of the world&#x27;s top classical musicians are Israelis or Israeli expatriates. The works of Israeli classical composers have been performed by leading orchestras worldwide.

Music in Israel is an integral part of national identity. Beginning in the days of the pioneers, Hebrew songs and public singalongs (&quot;Shira beTsibur&quot;) were encouraged and supported by the establishment. &quot;Public singalongs were a common pastime, and were for them a force in defining their identity&quot;, wrote Nathan Shahar. This view of music as nation-building continues to this day. &quot;We are in the midst of creating a culture&quot;, wrote Nahum Heyman, one of Israel&#x27;s leading music composers and music historians. Jewish immigrants from Europe, Asia, the Middle East and elsewhere brought with them their musical traditions, melding and molding them into a new Israeli sound.

==Global influences==
===Russian folk music===
Many of the Zionist immigrants who arrived before 1935 came from Russia. They brought with them the folk tunes and musical style of Russia. Songs in the early days were often contrafacta – Russian folk tunes with translated or new lyrics in Hebrew. An example is &quot;Shir Hamitpachat,&quot; (&quot;Song of the Kerchief&quot;) a Polish song by Jerzy Petersburski (Niebieska chusteczka, Sinij Platochek, синий платочек) with Hebrew lyrics by the Israeli poet and lyricist Nathan Alterman. These Russian-style tunes are generally in a minor key, and often accompanied by accordion, or by guitar imitating the sound of the balalaika.

===Eastern European klezmer music===
Klezmer music was also brought to the country by the immigrants of the early 20th century. Many Hassidic and klezmer melodies found their way into the canon of Israeli folk music, with lyrics translated from the Yiddish, or new Hebrew words. An example is &quot;Numi Numi&quot; (Sleep My Child), a song composed by Joel Engel based on a Hassidic lullaby, with lyrics by Yehiel Heilprin

=== Rock and pop music ===
Since the late 1960s, Israeli popular music has been deeply influenced by mainstream pop and rock music from the United Kingdom and the U.S. Iconic Israeli 1970s rock groups such as Kaveret and Tamouz and singer-songwriters such as Shalom Hanoch and Miki Gavrielov, laid the foundations for what is today the rich and varied scene of Israeli pop and rock. Mixing Western pop and rock with the original style of Israeli folk music and Oriental Jewish music, particularly Yemenite, Greek and Andalusian-Moroccan, creates together the original and unique sound of Israeli music today.

Among the leaders in Israeli music are singers and bands such as: Etti Ankri, David D&#x27;Or, Aviv Gefen, Rita, Shlomo Artzi, HaYehudim, Ivri Lider, and Dana International. Both Lider and International often sing songs dealing with their own sexual preferences – Lider&#x27;s song &quot;Jesse&quot; is about unrequited homosexual love, and International, a transsexual, began her singing career as a drag queen. Other pop stars include Ninet Tayeb, Harel Skaat and Shiri Maimon – all winners of the Israeli talent search TV show &quot;Kokhav Nolad&quot; (&quot;A Star is Born&quot;, the Israeli version of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;). Maimon represented Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005, and reached top 4 out of over 25 countries, with her ballad &quot;Hasheket Shenishar&quot; (&quot;The Silence That Remains&quot;).

In 2013, there were many collaborations between older Israeli singers and young artists. Corinne Elal, Arik Einstein, Chava Alberstein, Yehoram Gaon, Allon Olearchik and Shlomo Gronich all paired up with musicians of the younger generation. Most recently, Netta Barzilai won Eurovision&#x27;s singing competition, showcasing her diverse approach to songwriting and performance.

===Middle Eastern music===

The earliest composers of Hebrew folk music were influenced by the sounds of the local Arab music. Later, Oriental musical traditions were brought by Jewish immigrants from other Middle Eastern countries – from Morocco, Yemen, Iraq, Egypt and elsewhere. These immigrants developed an eclectic Mediterranean style called &quot;Muzika Mizrahit&quot; (Oriental music), which became increasingly popular in the early 1960s and was later influenced by popular Greek music (Rembetiko), whilst at the same time, influencing Israeli pop and rock. Muzika Mizrahit combines eastern and western elements: the ensemble includes Middle Eastern instruments, such as the oud, the kanun, the Eastern violin, the darbouka and the Greek bouzouki, alongside electric and acoustic guitars, pianos and other western instruments. The singers add Arab-style melismatic ornamentation, (&quot;silsulim&quot; in Hebrew), and often sing in a nasal tone, similar to Arab music. The melodies are often modal, swinging between major and minor, and diction is guttural. While Arab music is traditionally homophonic, based on melodic patterns called &quot;maqamat&quot;, Muzika Mizrahit is closer to Greek music, has harmonic accompaniment and usually uses a western, 12-tone scale.

The distinctive east–west sonorities of Muzika Mizrahit have left their imprint on Israeli popular music. An example is Zohar Argov&#x27;s &quot;HaPerach BeGani&quot; (&quot;The flower in my garden&quot;), with lyrics by Avihu Medina and music by Medina and Moshe Ben Mosh.

===Jewish Yemenite music===

The music of Yemenite Jews was particularly influential in the development of Israeli music because it was seen by early Zionists as a link to their biblical roots. The music of the ancient Hebrews, wrote the musicologist A.Z. Idelsohn, &quot;is preserved in memory and practice in various Jewish centers ... Yemen, in South Arabia, [is] a community that lived practically in seclusion for thirteen hundred years...&quot; There was a Yemenite Jewish community in Palestine before 1900, and the European immigrants who came in the 1920s were enamored of the Yemenite style. Many of the early Zionist folk songs were westernized versions of Yemenite songs. In the 1930s and 1940s, Yemenite singer Bracha Zefira researched and recorded many Yemenite songs, and also sang original compositions in the Yemenite style. An example is the song &quot;Shtu HaAdarim&quot; (Drink, the Flock), with words by Alexander Penn and music by Nahum Nardi.

Following Operation On Wings of Eagles, Aharon Amram became &quot;the first to record Yemenite music using instruments from outside its tradition,&quot; overcoming initial opposition by Israeli-Yemenite radio broadcasters who traditionally regarded authentic Yemenite music as being with nothing more than tin and didn&#x27;t want to air his performances. Among the instruments he accompanied his traditional Yemenite singing with were &quot;guitar, violin, qanoun [a kind of zither], trumpet, trombone and percussion instruments.&quot; Yemenite music reached a world audience in the 1980s as a result of the efforts of Israeli singer Ofra Haza, whose album &quot;Yemenite Songs&quot; became an international hit with world music fans. Haza grew up in a traditional Yemenite family who lived in Tel Aviv&#x27;s poor Hatikva neighborhood. She became famous for singing pop music, but later in her career became something of a cultural ambassador for her community, both in Israel and internationally. Several of her most famous tracks, such as &quot;Im Nin&#x27;alu&quot;, were reworkings of traditional Yemenite songs, many composed by Rabbi Shalom Shabazi, a medieval poet and mystic whose spiritual and artistic achievements are universally revered in the Yemenite community. Shabazi&#x27;s poetry dealt with both religious and secular themes, giving Yemenite music a wider lyrical range than many other forms of traditional Jewish music, which tend to be liturgical in nature.

===Greek, Latin American, Ethiopian and other influences===
Greek-style bouzouki music became increasingly popular in the early 1960s. Aris San, a non-Jewish Greek singer who moved to Israel and became an Israeli citizen, was the driving spirit behind this trend. One of Aris San&#x27;s hit songs was &quot;Sigal&quot; (lyrics by Yovav Katz). Aris San, who worked at the Zorba club in Jaffa, owned and opened by Shlomo Bachramov wrote songs for Aliza Azikri (&quot;Bahayim hakol over,&quot; &quot;Yesh ahava ata omer&quot;), that effectively broke down the barriers between Israeli song and the world of Greek and Mizrahi music. The songs of the iconic Greek singer Stelios Kazantzidis were translated into Hebrew and performed by the country&#x27;s leading singers. Being Greek, Yehuda Poliker has many songs that use bouzouki.

A number of young musicians traveled to South America in the late 1960s, and brought back Latin rhythms and sonorities which became a force in popular music through the 1970s. An example is the song &quot;Noah&quot; by Matti Caspi.

The American folk movement of the 1960s and 1970s influenced the Israeli national style, and Israeli folksingers, among them Chava Alberstein – patterned themselves after Judy Collins and Joni Mitchell. In the 1960s, guitar duos such as the Dudaim and the Parvarim performed not only &quot;canonical&quot; Israeli songs, but also Hebrew versions of American and British folk songs.

The 1970s saw the growth of a new eclecticism in Israeli music. Rock, jazz and other genres began to strike roots, influenced by worldwide trends but also adding elements that were uniquely Israeli.

The Idan Raichel Project, a successful pop/ethnic group formed in the 2000s, merges Ethiopian and Western music. Raichel collaborated with Ethiopian Jewish immigrants to produce a unique sound, combining Electronic music sounds, classic piano, electric guitar, traditional drums and Ethiopian-style singing, with its complex quartertone scales and rhythms. The songs are sung in a combination of Hebrew and Amharic.

The &quot;Shirei Eretz Yisrael&quot; – &quot;Songs of the Land of Israel&quot; or &quot;Zemer ivri&quot;. These songs were composed from 1920 to the mid-1970s.

The early Zionist settlers originated this eclectic style. Beginning in the early 1920s, the pioneers sought to create a new style of music that would strengthen ties with their Hebrew roots and distinguish them from Diaspora Jewry and its perceived weakness. Elements were borrowed a bit from Arabic music and, to a lesser extent, traditional Yemenite and eastern Jewish music. The songs were often homophonic, modal, and limited in range. Examples of this emerging style include &quot;Shedemati&quot; by Yedidia Admon, and &quot;Shibbolet Basadeh&quot; by Matityahu Shelem.

The songs have certain identifying musical characteristics:

* Use of minor keys. The canonical songs are almost universally in minor. Songs based in the Russian or klezmer traditions normally use the harmonic minor (that is, with an elevated seventh), while songs in the New Hebrew style use natural minor, often with a diminished second leading to the tonic. Songs in this style are also sometimes modal, or semimodal, ending on the dominant rather than the tonic. An example is &quot;Moshe&quot;, by Emmanuel Zamir, sung by Yaffa Yarkoni.
* Horah, Temani, Atari and other dance rhythms. These dance rhythms often have strong offbeats and asymmetric meters. They accompany popular Israeli folk dances. An example of a debka rhythm is &quot;At Adama&quot;, based on a Bedouin melody, and sung by Ran Eliran.
* Use of the darbuka, the tambourine and other instruments associated with middle eastern music.
* Lyrics that relate to the Israeli experience. As one might expect in a country that has faced major wars and military conflicts since its inception, army life and wars are common themes in Israeli songwriting. Very few of the war songs are marching songs, and none denigrate the Arab enemies. Most are melancholy, focusing on separation and loss during war, and the longing for peace. Many songs are about pioneering, building up the land, and love of hiking and nature. Others are based on biblical texts. A typical pioneer marching song is &quot;Anu Nihiyeh HaRishonim&quot; (We will be the first), with words by Yosef Haftman to a traditional melody.
* A distinctive vocal style. Israeli singers – especially those of Yemenite origin or who specialize in more middle eastern style songs – tend to sing with a guttural, throaty enunciation. A folk legend contends that these singers would drink water from goatskin watersacks, and the hairs of the goat would stick in their throats. An example of this style can be heard in the song &quot;Ein Adir KeAdonai&quot;, (There is none so great as God), a traditional liturgical melody sung by Bracha Zefira.

==Early history==
The first efforts to create a corpus of music suitable for a new Jewish entity that would eventually become Israel were in 1882. This was the year of the First Aliyah, the first wave of Jewish immigrants seeking to create a national homeland in Palestine. As there were no songs yet written for this national movement, Zionist youth movements in Germany and elsewhere published songbooks, using traditional German and other folk melodies with new words written in Hebrew. An example of this is the song that became Israel&#x27;s national anthem, &quot;Hatikvah&quot;. The words, by the Hebrew poet Naftali Herz Imber, express the longing of the Jewish people to return to the land of Zion. The melody is a popular eastern European folk melody.

In 1895 settlers established the first Jewish orchestra in Palestine. The orchestra was a wind band, located in the town of Rishon LeZion, and played light classics and marches.

Avraham Zvi Idelsohn, a trained cantor from Russia and a musicologist, settled in Jerusalem in 1906, with the objective of studying and documenting the musics of the various Jewish communities there. At the time, there were a number of Jewish enclaves in Jerusalem, for Yemenites, Hassids, Syrians and other Jewish ethnic groups. Idelsohn meticulously documented the songs and musical idioms of these groups. He also made the first efforts to bring these songs to the attention of all Jewish settlers, with the aim of creating a new Jewish musical genre.

Idelsohn was joined in Palestine by a few more classically trained musicians and ethnomusicologists, including Gershon Ephros in 1909 and, later, Joel Engel in 1924. Like Idelsohn, Engel worked to disseminate traditional ethnic tunes and styles to the general Jewish public of Palestine.
The Second Aliyah, beginning in 1904, saw an increase in composition of original songs by Jewish settlers in Palestine. Among the earliest composers of folk songs were Hanina Karchevsky (&quot;BeShadmot Beit Lehem&quot;), and David Ma&#x27;aravi (&quot;Shirat Hanoar&quot;).

Over the next 30 years, Jewish composers in Palestine began to seek new rhythmic and melodic modes that would distinguish their songs from the traditional European music they had been brought up on. Leaders of this musical movement were Matityahu Shelem (&quot;VeDavid Yefe Eynaim&quot;, &quot;Shibbolet Basadeh&quot;), Yedidia Admon (&quot;Shadmati&quot;), and others. These composers sought to imitate the sounds of Arabic and other Middle Eastern music. They used simple harmonies, and preferred the natural minor to melodic and harmonic minors used by European music. They especially eschewed the interval of the augmented second, part of the &quot;gypsy minor&quot; scale used typically in klezmer music. &quot;Its character is depressing and sentimental&quot;, wrote music critic and composer Menashe Ravina in 1943. &quot;The healthy desire to free ourselves of this sentimentalism causes many to avoid this interval.&quot;

Some musicians of the period, like Marc Lavry (&quot;Shir Ha-Emek&quot;, &quot;Kitatenu Balayla Tzoedet&quot;), wrote in both the new Hebrew style and the European style in which they were trained. For example, &quot;Zemer&quot; is a song in the new style; Dan HaShomer is an opera in the European classical tradition. Others, like Mordechai Zeira, lamented the fact that they did not write in the new Hebrew mold. Zeira, one of the most prolific and popular composers of the period (&quot;Hayu Leylot&quot;, &quot;Layla Layla&quot;, &quot;Shney Shoshanim&quot;), referred to his inability to write in the new style as &quot;the Russian disease&quot;.

Emanuel Zamir worked in the 40s and 50s in a genre known as &quot;shirei ro&#x27;im&quot; (shepherd songs). He combined Bedouin music with Biblical-style lyrics, often accompanied by the recorder.

=== Music as a nation builder ===
The movement to create a repertoire of Hebrew songs, and specifically a distinctive musical style for those songs, was seen not merely as a creative outlet, but as a national imperative. This imperative – which influenced the literature, theater and graphic arts of the period as well as music – was to seek cultural roots of the new Israeli nation in the culture of the ancient Hebrews of the Bible. The characteristics of the new Hebrew style, contended composer Yitzhak Edel, are &quot;remnants of ancient Hebrew music that have struggled to survive the years of diaspora... the primitive life of our settlers, who broke away from the European civilization, sought a musical expression that would suit their world view.&quot;

In light of the national importance of creating a new Hebrew repertoire, the effort received support of national institutions. The Histadrut Labor Union, which, prior to the founding of the state of Israel served many of the functions of a government, created the &quot;Merkaz LeTarbut&quot; (Cultural Center), which published many songbooks, and subsidized the composition of works by Hebrew composers. Public singalongs were actively encouraged. The kibbutz movements distributed songsters and established the singalong as a central daily event in kibbutz life. Public singalongs were also seen as a way of teaching Hebrew to new immigrants from Europe and, later, from Middle Eastern countries.

The state radio has also been a powerful force in promoting the Hebrew song. Until 1990, all radio and television stations were government owned and controlled. As such, they were leading arbiters of taste in Palestine and later in Israel. &quot;... the stations perceived it their duty to initiate special projects for the preservation of the Israeli song heritage and to encourage the writing and recording of &#x27;authentic&#x27; music.&quot;
According to Netiva Ben-Yehuda, linguist and music historian, youths carried notebooks to jot down the songs they would sing with their friends.

This view—that Israeli music is a defining element in the creation of Israeli culture—continues to this day, and influences artists in all musical genres—pop, rock, and classical.

=== Musical cabarets ===

Starting in the 1920s, café and cabaret music became popular in Palestine, and became an important formative force in Israeli music. Before the establishment of the state, there were three leading cabarets – HaKumkum (The Kettle), HaMetate (The Broom), and Li-La-Lo. These cabarets staged variety shows that combined political satire, drama and song.

The cabarets were launching pads for the careers of some of Israel&#x27;s leading popular music stars: Shoshana Damari, who popularized Yemenite-style singing worldwide, started performing as a teenager at Li-La-Lo; Yafa Yarkoni also started as a cabaret singer. Composers Nahum Nardi (&quot;Shtu HaAdarim&quot;, &quot;Kahol Yam HaMayim&quot;), Moshe Vilensky (&quot;BeKhol Zot Yesh Ba Mashehu&quot;, &quot;Hora Mamtera&quot;), Daniel Sambursky (&quot;Shir HaEmek&quot;, &quot;Zemer HaPlugot&quot;), and others created songs that became part of the canonical Israeli repertoire. Poet Nathan Alterman wrote many of the lyrics.

The cabarets also contributed to diversity in Israeli music. Many of the songs were in a popular, light style, distinct from the New Hebrew style or the Russian folk style that was prevalent. Many songs were in the major key rather than minor, had upbeat rhythms and included tangos, sambas and other Latin styles.

Cabarets and musical reviews continued after the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948.

=== Aliyah of musicians in the 1930s ===
The rise of Nazism in Europe forced many Jewish musicians to leave. Some of these musicians came to Israel. The immigration included some of the leading classical musicians of Europe, including Ödön Pártos, concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic, Paul Ben-Haim, composer and opera conductor, and composer Alexander Uriah Boskovich.

Just as writers of popular music sought a new Hebrew style, many classical composers sought new modes of composition that would give expression to their new national identity. &quot;... One cannot continue in this country writing works which are based on purely western concepts&quot;, wrote music critic David Rosolio in 1946. &quot;The landscape, the lifestyle, the environment, all require a change and fundamentally different approach.&quot; Boskovich in his &quot;Semitic Suite&quot; for piano (1945) writes in a homophonic style with a drone accompaniment and repeated notes, imitating the sound of the Arabic oud and kanun. Ben-Haim wrote &quot;Sonata A Tre&quot; for cembalo, mandolin and guitar (1968), which also has a distinctly Middle Eastern sound.

== Israel Philharmonic Orchestra ==
By 1935, Jewish musicians throughout Europe were faced with dismissal, persecution, and expulsion. To meet the pressing need to rescue these musicians, concert violinist Bronislaw Huberman decided to form an orchestra in Palestine – both as a safe haven and as a unique musical endeavor. Huberman recruited musicians from Europe&#x27;s leading orchestras, and the Palestine Philharmonic made its debut in December 1936, under the baton of Arturo Toscanini. The Israel Philharmonic Orchestra has been a leading force in Israeli music and culture. It has debuted many works by Israeli composers, and has helped launch the careers of many Israeli musicians. The orchestra has played a number of concerts that have had historic significance for Israel. In 1967, immediately after the 1967 war, conductor Leonard Bernstein led the orchestra on a tour to the Sinai desert, the site of fighting only days before. The symphony also performed on the Lebanese border in the 1980s, playing to an audience of mixed Israelis and Lebanese who gathered on both sides of the border fence to listen. Music director Zubin Mehta, though not himself an Israeli, speaks some Hebrew and is an important figure in the Israeli musical scene.

== Music and the military ==
The military establishment in Israel, and the role of the military in Israeli culture, have been decisive influences on Israeli music.

In the wake of decades of conflict with the Arabs, the themes of war and peace have become an integral part of Israeli music. From pre-state times until the present day, many songs deal with war, sacrifice, loss, heroism, and the longing for peace. Extremely militaristic songs that glorify triumph over the enemy are not the standard in the Israeli repertoire. Rather, most songs dealing with war are melancholy in tone. An extreme example is the song &quot;Eliphelet&quot;: to a halting melody in a minor key by Sasha Argov, the song (lyrics by Natan Alterman) tells of a boy &quot;without a penny&#x27;s worth of character&quot;, who is killed in combat for an unthinking error of judgment.
The influence of the military on Israeli music, however, goes far beyond its being a source of inspiration for songs. The military establishment has been an active promoter of music, through its corps of military performance groups, and through its army-run radio station, Galei Tsahal.

Since the 1950s, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has run performing groups called &quot;Lehakot Tsva&#x27;iyot&quot; (Army Ensembles). These groups, comprising enlisted soldiers with talent or performing experience, tour bases and field positions to entertain the troops. Performing original materials meticulously prepared and performed, these groups became leaders in the Israeli music and entertainment field. Many of Israel&#x27;s most popular songs were written for the Lehakot Tsva&#x27;iyot – for example, &quot;Dina Barzilai&quot; (words: Haim Hefer, music: Sasha Argov), &quot;Halleluya&quot; (words and music: Yair Rosenblum), &quot;Yeshnan Banot&quot; (words: Yoram Tahar-Lev, music: Yair Rosenblum). Dubi Zeltzer, considered one of the founding fathers of Israeli pop music, wrote many of the songs for the Nahal Brigade entertainment troupe.

The Lehakot Tsva&#x27;iyot were incubators for performers and composers who, from the 1960s to the present, have become Israel&#x27;s stars. Among the artists who began their careers in the Lehakot are Arik Einstein, Chava Alberstein, the members of Kaveret, Yehoram Gaon, Nehama Hendel, Yisrael Borochov, Yardena Arazi, Shlomo Artzi, Etti Ankri, and David D&#x27;Or. Composers and lyricists who made their names writing material for the Lehakot include Naomi Shemer, Yohanan Zarai, Yoni Rechter, Nurit Hirsh, and Yair Rosenblum.
Galey Tsahal, the IDF-run radio station, has been a force in promoting original Israeli music. Galey Tsahal began broadcasting in 1950. It devoted much of its broadcast time to popular music.

The music of the Lehakot and of Galey Tsahal was not specifically military music; most of the songs produced and broadcast were general songs. However, the IDF did see music as an important propaganda tool, and actually sponsored the composition of songs on subjects it deemed important. For example, lyricist Haim Hefer was invited to spend a week accompanying the elite commando group &quot;Haruv&quot;, and to base a song on his experience. The result was &quot;Yesh Li Ahuv BeSayeret Haruv&quot; (I have a lover in the Haruv commando unit) (music: Yair Rosenblum).

One of these groups, From Israel with Love, went on a world tour. Performing for sold-out crowds all over the United States with a tour planned for Europe. Ultimately the 1972 group was broken up early due to Munich massacre during the 1972 Summer Olympics.

== 1967 as a turning point ==
The 1967 war marked an important turning point in Israeli culture. In the words of Amos Elon, &quot;in the Six Day War of 1967, the Israeli people came of age... it marked the transition from adolescence to maturity.&quot; The period after the war saw a burgeoning of cultural activity – within a few years, the number of art galleries increased by a third, the number of theaters doubled, and a proliferation of restaurants, night clubs, and discothèques opened. Economic growth went from 1 percent per annum before the war to 13 percent the following year.

The Israeli music scene opened up to the rest of the world. Rock music, which prior to the war had almost no audience and was almost never played on the state radio, started drawing audiences. Muzika Mizrahit, the underground style of popular music enjoyed by Israelis of Mizrahi origin, gradually gained legitimacy and recognition. Israeli musicians performed abroad with increasing frequency, and European and American musicians came to Israel to perform.

In this growth of diversification, much Israeli music lost its national flavor, and became largely inspired by international styles. The Israeli preoccupation with defining a national style faded. &quot;I don&#x27;t like the attempt to be ethnic very much&quot;, said rock musician Shalom Hanoch in an interview. &quot;I don&#x27;t search for roots [in my music], my roots are within me... I don&#x27;t have to add oriental flavor for people to know that I am from the Middle East.&quot;

Nonetheless, many Israeli musicians, both popular and classical, continued to be concerned with defining a distinctly national identity in their music.

==Evolution of the music industry==
Starting in 1967, the productions of the Lehakot Tzva&#x27;iyot became much more elaborate, and for the next five years these groups played a defining role in Israeli music. However, in the 1980s the Lehakot started to decline, until they were discontinued altogether. Taking their place as a breeding ground for new musical talent were the two classical music academies in Israel – The Rubin Academy in Jerusalem and the Buchmann-Mehta School of Music in Tel Aviv – as well as two private schools that teach mostly jazz and popular music (The Rimon school in Ramat Hasharon and the Hed school in Tel Aviv).

Until the end of the 1980s, the Israeli government, primarily through its control of radio and television, continued to play a central role in shaping the musical tastes of Israelis. In 1965, a feud between rival concert promoters was behind conservative forces in the government that refused to allocate foreign currency to pay for the Beatles to play in Israel. Some rock and Muzika Mizrahit artists complained that the radio and television discriminated against their music, preventing the commercial success of these increasingly popular genres.

With the commercialization of Israeli radio and television in the 1990s, the hegemony of the state-run media as arbiters of musical taste declined. In their place, recording companies, impresarios and clubs became increasingly important in finding new talent and advancing careers, in a manner more typical of European and American industries.

== Song contests ==
From 1960 to 1980, Israeli radio and television promoted music by running frequent song contests. Success in a song contest was often the key to success for an artist in those days.

Although geographically not in Europe, Israel is within the European Broadcasting Area and is a member of the European Broadcasting Union, and can thus participate in the Eurovision Song Contest. Israel made its first appearance there in 1973 and quickly found success in 1978, when the Israeli song &quot;A-Ba-Ni-Bi&quot;, sung by Izhar Cohen and Alphabeta, with words by Ehud Manor and music by Nurit Hirsh, won first place. Israel won first place again the following year with &quot;Hallelujah&quot; (lyrics: Shimrit Or, music: Kobi Oshrat), performed by Milk and Honey), in 1998 with &quot;Diva&quot; (lyrics: Yoav Ginai, music: Svika Pick), performed by Dana International, and for the fourth and last time in 2018, when Netta Barzilai sang &quot;Toy&quot; (lyrics and music: Doron Medalie and Stav Beger) and won with 529 points.

==Popular genres==

=== Early Israeli rock ===

From pre-1967 beginnings in marginal clubs in Tel Aviv, Israeli rock music has grown to a musical force worldwide. With hundreds of bands, dozens of clubs, and many star performers, Israeli rock has grown to be &quot;the dominant music culture in Israel.&quot;

The first successful rock group in Israel was &quot;The Churchills&quot;, formed in 1967 by guitarists Haim Romano and Yitzhak Klepter. Singer Arik Einstein, a graduate of the Lehakot Tzva&#x27;iyot and a rising star in the Israeli music world, chose them as his backup group in 1969, and together they were the first group to offer a publicly acceptable rock sound.

In the 1970s, the Israeli rock idiom was developed by:

* Svika Pick, first Israeli rocker to appear in punk and glam-style outfits
* Shmulik Kraus, Josie Katz and Arik Einstein who banded together to form the trio &quot;Hahalonot Hagvohim&quot; (the High Windows).
* Kaveret, with singer Gidi Gov and guitarist and composer Danny Sanderson. Kaveret, formed in 1972, was instant success. Songs from their album &quot;Sippurei Poogy&quot; (Stories of Poogy) are still played on Israeli radio today.
* Shalom Hanoch, composer, guitarist and singer. The album &quot;Sof Onat Hatapuzim&quot; (The end of the Orange Season), of his songs, was released in 1976. It had the hardest rock sound of any group yet, and is considered a landmark in Israeli rock history.

=== Progressive rock and folk ===

Alongside the development of Israeli rock music, the tradition of the folk style continued. Singers like Chava Alberstein, Yehoram Gaon and Naomi Shemer continued to write and perform songs in the canonical &quot;Land of Israel&quot; style. Naomi Shemer&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Yerushalayim Shel Zahav&quot; (Jerusalem of Gold), &quot;Hoy Artsi Moladeti&quot; (Oh my Land My Homeland, lyrics Shaul Tchernichovsky), &quot;Horshat HaEkaliptus&quot; (The Eucalyptus Grove), have become icons in the patriotic repertoire. Much of her success, including &quot;Yerushalaim Shel Zahav&quot;, was due to the song contests of the time.

Bridging the parallel developments of Israeli rock and the continuation of the Land of Israel tradition was a group of musicians who sought to create an authentic Israeli style that would incorporate elements of the new rock sound. These artists include Yehudit Ravitz, Yoni Rechter, Shlomo Gronich, Matti Caspi, as well as rock pioneers Gidi Gov, Danny Sanderson and Arik Einstein. Their style of progressive rock often adopted the lyrical ballad style of the canonical repertoire, and mixed traditional instruments—flute and recorder, darbuka, and acoustical guitar—with electric guitars, trap sets and synthesizers. Unlike typical hard rock, with its repetitive common-time rhythms and straightforward chord progressions, the songs of these artists were often complex rhythmically and harmonically. Matti Caspi&#x27;s song &quot;Noah&quot;, for example, has a Latin feel, with strong jazz-like offbeats, chromatic harmonic accompaniments, and words relating to the biblical story of Noah. David Broza made flamenco style music popular in the late 70s and 80s.
Rock was something of a musical revolution for Israel. However, unlike the rock music of America in the 1960s and 1970s, it was not always an expression of social revolution. Israeli rock, up until 1985, with the appearance of Aviv Gefen, almost never dealt with the themes of drugs, sex, youthful anger and alienation (though Arik Einstein&#x27;s &quot;Shuv Lo Shaket&quot; is an exception), and revolution. Its stars, with the exception of Shalom Hanoch and Svika Pick, were clean-cut Israelis, mostly with neatly trimmed hair, who had served in the army and were exemplary citizens.

Aviv Gefen changed that. Starting his career at age 17, Gefen appeared on stage in drag and heavy makeup, bragged about his evasion of the draft, and sang about drugs, sex and alienation in a hard-rock style reminiscent of Punk Rock. His music struck a deep chord among Israeli youth. He also symbolised the break with the old traditions, though his Beatles and Pink Floyd influenced music was in no sharp contrast stylistically to that of his father, Yehonatan Geffen, one of the leading lyricists of the day.
Aviv Gefen is still considered as one of Israel&#x27;s biggest selling contemporary male artist today, though his style and early provocative appearance has dramatically mellowed in recent years.

=== Israeli pop and dance music ===
Since 1980, the number of Israeli groups has multiplied, with hundreds of groups singing in all modern styles. Leading performers have included the internationally acclaimed singer Ofra Haza (singer of &quot;Im Nin&#x27;Alu&quot;, from the album &quot;Shaday&quot; [1988]), Berry Sakharof, often referred to as &quot;The Prince of Israeli Rock&quot;; Rami Fortis, the groups &quot;Efo HaYeled?&quot; (Where is the Child?), &quot;Ethnix&quot;, &quot;Teapacks&quot;, &quot;Tislam&quot;, &quot;Mashina&quot;, &quot;Zikney Tzfat&quot; (The Elders of Safad), &quot;Rockfour&quot;, &quot;HaMakhshefot&quot; (The Witches), &quot;Mofa Ha&#x27;arnavot Shel Dr. Kasper&quot; (Dr. Kasper&#x27;s Rabbits Show), Monica Sex and Shimron Elit (&quot;20:20&quot;).

Singers who mix rock and pop elements with the traditional songs of the Land of Israel are usually achieving tremendous popularity and considered as leading acts in Israeli music today, singers such as Rita, Shlomo Artzi, Achinoam Nini, Ivri Lider, Aviv Gefen, Dana Berger, Evyatar Banai, Harel Skaat, Ninet Tayeb, Shiri Maimon, Dana International, Sharon Haziz, Mika Karni Roni Duani, David D&#x27;or, Metropolin and many more. Most of these artists also like to mix some elements of electronic sounds of dance music, so you can find style influences of pop icons such as Madonna and Kylie Minogue in Israeli music as well.

===Jazz===
In 2012 and 2013, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers named Israeli musician Uri Gurvich as the best up-and-coming jazz composer.

===Israeli world music===
Yisrael Borochov works in the genres of world and Middle Eastern music in Israel, imbuing Israeli music with Arabic and Bedouin influences. He also runs the East West House, where some of the country&#x27;s youngest talents come to play their esoteric ethnic music in the eclectic and mixed Jewish and Arabic environment of Jaffa.. The Idan Raichel Project is a collection of music from all around the world, such as Ethiopia, Germany, Portugal, as well as other Middle Eastern countries, in which songs are often sung in multiple languages.

=== Psychedelic trance, electronic and house music ===
Psychedelic trance is popular in Israel, and some Israeli trance (including Goa trance and nitzhonot) artists have gained international recognition, among them Alien Project, Astrix, Astral Projection, Maor Levi, Vini Vici, Zafrir and Infected Mushroom. Offer Nissim is one of the most internationally acclaimed contemporary house music producers.

=== Rap and hip hop ===

Israel has developed its own brand of rap and hip hop with groups such as Hadag Nahash, Subliminal, Sagol 59 and Kele 6 performing Israeli hip hop.

=== Heavy metal ===
Israel has a small underground metal scene, as shown in the documentary &quot;Global Metal&quot;. Though some heavy metal in Israel is seen as Satanic, Salem and Melechesh have overcome controversy and become well known in the extreme metal underground.

=== Classical music ===
After 1967, classical composers in Israel continued their quest for an Israeli identity in art music. Some Israeli composers have chosen explicitly Jewish or Middle Eastern materials for their compositions.

* Leon Schidlowsky, was born in Chile and settled in Israel in 1969, when he was 38 years old. Many of his compositions are inspired by Jewish themes, including the Holocaust, without forgetting his Latin American origin. Several of his symphonic works have been premiered by the Israel Philharmonic. Schidlowsky was a professor at the Tel Aviv University.
* Betty Olivero uses melodies and modes from her Sephardic Jewish background, building layers of overtones and pantonal harmonies on top of them, so the effect is at the same time very dissonant yet clearly familiar. Despite its modernity, her music has a distinctly Sephardic and tonal character. An example is &quot;Achot Ketana&quot;, based on a 13th-century Sephardic prayer, and quoting from a Bach chaconne.
* Tsippi Fleischer sets classical poetry in Arabic, Ugarith, and other languages to contemporary music. She uses many features of Arabic music in her compositions, including the use of maqamat, with complex microtonic intonation, combined with traditional Arabic, Western classical and modern instrumentation. An example is &quot;The Goddess Anath&quot;, based on scripts in Ugarith, a composition in multimedia for woman&#x27;s voice, violin, piano, percussion and dancer.
* Andre Hajdu, an immigrant from Hungary, has arranged Hassidic tunes for jazz ensemble.
* Mark Kopytman, a Russian immigrant, has composed symphonic and chamber works based on Jewish themes. An example is his composition &quot;Memory&quot; for string orchestra, which recalls the klezmer music of Eastern Europe.
Other Israeli composers of note, including Noam Sherif, Ami Maayani, Yehezkel Braun, and Zvi Avni, have also used Jewish and Israeli themes in their compositions. A new generation of composers includes Yitzhak Yedid, Lior Navok, Gilad Hochman.

In addition to the Israel Philharmonic, a number of other Israeli orchestras have achieved renown. These include the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, which is supported by the state radio and television authority; the Rishon LeZion Orchestra, and the Camerata Orchestra. One of the motivations for creating these orchestras was to provide employment for Russian immigrant musicians, who arrived in Israel with a high professional level but could not find jobs in their field.

The New Israel Opera Company was founded in 1985. This was the first successful attempt to establish a permanent repertory opera, after a series of failed attempts starting in the 1940s In 1995, the Opera moved into a permanent home in the Golda Center in Tel Aviv.

Israel has produced some of the world&#x27;s leading performers and conductors. These include pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim, conductor Eliahu Inbal and a large number of violinists, among them Itzhak Perlman, Pinchas Zukerman, Gil Shaham, Ivry Gitlis, Gil Shohat and Shlomo Mintz.

The Jerusalem Quartet is a string quartet that has achieved international acclaim. Other leading chamber groups include the Jerusalem Trio, the Tel Aviv Soloists, the Carmel Quartet and the Aviv Quartet.

===Mizrahi music===
Israeli immigrant communities from Arab countries have over the last 50 years created a blended musical style that combines Turkish, Greek, Arabic, and Israeli elements. As opposed to the New Hebrew Style, which was the conscious creation of Eastern European immigrants trying to define their new Israeli identity, the Muzika Mizrahit style is truly spontaneous and indigenous. Initially met with hostility by the mainstream cultural institutions of Israel, it has now become a major force in Israeli culture.

The Muzika Mizrahit movement started in the 1950s with homegrown performers in the ethnic neighborhoods of Israel – the predominantly Yemenite &quot;Kerem Hatemanim&quot; neighborhood of Tel Aviv, Moroccan neighborhoods and neighborhoods of Iranian and Iraqi immigrants – who played at weddings and other events. They performed songs in Hebrew, but in a predominantly Arabic style, on traditional instruments – the Oud, the Kanun, and the darbuka. Jo Amar and Filfel al-Masry, were two early proponents of Moroccan and Egyptian extraction. In the 1960s, they added acoustic guitar and electric guitar, and their sound became more eclectic. Vocalists typically decorated their singing with melisma and other oriental-style ornaments, and delivery was often nasal or guttural in character. Intonation was typically Western, however; singers did not use the quartertone scales typical of Arabic music.
Lyrics were originally texts taken from classic Hebrew literature, including liturgical texts and poems by medieval Hebrew poets. Later they added texts by Israeli poets, and began writing original lyrics as well. An example is the song &quot;Hanale Hitbalbela&quot; (Hannale was confused), sung by Izhar Cohen. The lyrics are by the modern Hebrew poet and lyricist Natan Alterman, to a traditional tune.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, a few of these performers began distributing their songs on cassette tapes. The tapes were an instant hit. They were sold in kiosks in the rundown shopping area around the Tel Aviv bus station, and the music became known derogatorily as &quot;Muzikat Kassetot&quot;, cassette music, or &quot;Bus station music&quot;. Performers during this period included Shimi Tavori, Zehava Ben and Zohar Argov, whose song &quot;HaPerah BeGani&quot; (the Flower in my Garden) became a major hit. Argov, a controversial character who died in 1987 by suicide while in jail, became known as the &quot;King of Muzika Mizrahit&quot;; he became a folk hero, and a movie was made of his life.

Despite the obvious popularity of this music, the state radio eschewed Muzika Mizrahit almost entirely. &quot;The educational and cultural establishment made every effort to separate the second generation of eastern immigrants from this music, by intense socialization in schools and in the media&quot;, wrote the social researcher Sami Shalom Chetrit.

The penetration of Muzika Mizrahit into the Israeli establishment was the result of pressure by Mizrahi composers and producers such as Avihu Medina, the overwhelming, undeniable popularity of the style, and the gradual adoption of elements of Muzika Mizrahit by mainstream artists. Yardena Arazi, one of Israel&#x27;s most popular stars, made a recording in 1989 called &quot;Dimion Mizrahi&quot; (Eastern Imagination), and included original materials and some canonic Israeli songs. Also, some performers started developing a fusion style of Muzika Mizrahit, Israeli, Greek, rock, and other styles. These included Ehud Banai, Yehuda Poliker, and Shlomo Bar, whose group &quot;HaBrera HaTivit&quot; (The Natural Choice, or the Natural Selection) incorporated Sitars, tabla, and other Indian instruments to create a new, &quot;World&quot; style.
The acceptance of Muzika Mizrahit, over the 1990s, parallels the social struggle of Israelis of Mizrahi origin to achieve social and cultural acceptance. &quot;Today, the popular Muzika Mizrahit has begun to erase the differences from rock music, and we can see not a few artists turning into mainstream... This move to the mainstream culture includes cultural assimilation&quot;, writes literary researcher and critic Mati Shmuelof.

=== Hassidic and Orthodox Jewish music ===
The Orthodox Jewish community of Israel, and its parallel community in the United States, have developed a unique form of Hassidic rock, which has become popular throughout the young orthodox community. This musical form combines the sonorities, instrumentation and rhythms of rock music with melodies which are in a klezmer style, and words taken mostly from religious texts. This rather anomalous combination is produced, performed and broadcast in nearly complete segregation from secular Israeli music. It is never heard on secular radio stations, or in secular public performances. It is broadcast on religious radio stations and played at religious events.

One of the pioneers of Hassidic rock was the &quot;singing rabbi,&quot; Shlomo Carlebach, who developed a large following in New York in the 1960s, singing religious songs in a folk style reminiscent of Peter, Paul and Mary. Israeli Hassidic rock performers include the group Reva L&#x27;Sheva and singers Adi Ran and Naftali Abramson. Because of an halakhic restriction on women singing to mixed audiences, there are no women in Hassidic rock groups. Concerts will usually be gender segregated.

While the style is embraced enthusiastically by the religious Zionist movement, including Gush Emunim, it is not without its opponents within the Haredi community. Some Haredi rabbis have &quot;a hard time with someone screaming out &#x27;Yes, there&#x27;s the Holy One, blessed be He&#x27; at the top of his lungs all of a sudden&quot;, says Kobi Sela, religious music critic. Religious singer-songwriter Ishay Ribo, who pens original lyrics on themes such as spirituality, faith, and God, has built large fan bases among both religious and secular audiences due to the quality of his music and his artistic expression.

=== Israeli Arab music ===

The Arab community in Israel, comprising 20 percent of Israel&#x27;s permanent population at the end of 2007, has developed its own unique forms of musical expression.

Until the early 1990s, little original music was produced by this community and the focus was on the great stars of the Arab world – Umm Kulthum, Fairuz, Farid al-Atrash, and others. Original local music did not achieve popularity or wide distribution among the local population until the 1980s. For the most part, local performers at weddings and other events played music written in Egypt, Lebanon, and Syria.

With the onset of the 21st century, local stars emerged, among them the internationally acclaimed oud and violin virtuoso Taiseer Elias, singer Amal Murkus, and brothers Samir and Wissam Joubran. Israeli Arab musicians have achieved fame beyond Israel&#x27;s borders: Elias and Murkus frequently play to audiences in Europe and America, and oud player Darwish Darwish (Prof. Elias&#x27;s student) was awarded first prize in the all-Arab oud contest in Egypt in 2003.

Living as an Arab minority within Israel has been an influence on Israeli Arabs, which is reflected in their music. Israeli Arab musicians are in the forefront of the quest to define their emerging identity. Lyrics deal with issues of identity, conflict, remembrance and peace. For example, Kamilya Jubran&#x27;s song &quot;Ghareeba&quot;, a setting of a poem by Khalil Gibran, deals with a sense of isolation and loneliness felt by the Arab Palestinian woman:


Several groups have emerged, such as Elias&#x27;s &quot;Bustan Avraham&quot;, &quot;The Olive Leaves&quot;, and Shlomo Gronich&#x27;s Israeli-Palestinian ensemble in which Jews and Palestinians perform together, creating a fusion style of music. Joint musical bands such as &quot;Zimrat Yah&quot;, &quot;Shams Tishrin&quot;, &quot;Blues Job&quot;, and &quot;Sahar&quot;, appear all over Israel, particularly in the Galilee.&quot;The Olive Leaves&quot; gave a successful concert tour in Jordan in 1995, with lead singer Shoham Eynav (Jewish) singing songs in both Hebrew and Arabic.

Israeli Arabs have also branched out into other musical styles. Palestinian hip-hop artist Tamer Nafar, founder of the rap group DAM, became an independent rap star after a politically charged dispute with Israeli rapper Subliminal. His music expresses the frustration and alienation that many Israeli-Palestinians feel. The rock music of Basam Beromi, singer of the group &quot;Khalas&quot; (Enough!), protests against the strictures of traditional Arab society. The song &quot;What have we come to?&quot;, for example, tells the story of a young girl in love, whose family murders her for violating strict traditional codes of courtship. London-trained guitarist Michel Sajrawy combines jazz, rock, and gypsy with classical Arab music.

While music education for Israeli Arabs is less developed, there has been a steady growth of opportunities in this sector. The Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance has an advanced degree program, headed by Taiseer Elias, in Arabic music. In 2007, the first precollege conservatory for the Arab-speaking population opened in Shfaram.

===Iraqi Jewish music===

The Iraqi Jews who immigrated to Israel in the early 1950s have preserved their own musical tradition. In the first half of the 20th century, almost all professional instrumental musicians in Iraq were Jewish. They played in the Imperial Orchestra, in the Baghdad radio orchestra, and in the nightclubs of Baghdad. Leading performers included composer and Oud player Ezra Aharon, violinist Salih Al-Kuwaiti and his brother, oud player Dawud Al-Kuwaiti, composer Salim Al&#x27;Nur, singer Salima Pasha, and others. Between 1949 and 1950, almost all these professional musicians fled Iraq for Israel. The Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) Arabic Orchestra was instrumental in sustaining their musical traditions in Israel.

Many of these musicians were forced to seek employment outside the music business, but they continued to perform in the community. &quot;Our musical tradition continues&quot;, said Suad Bazun, singer and daughter to a family of leading Iraqi musicians. &quot;Today the grandchildren and the great-grandchildren continue to fill their homes with the songs of Iraq.&quot;

===Yiddish and Ladino music===
 Yiddish and Ladino are enjoying a revival in Israel. A number of private language institutes and universities offer programs in these languages, which were the spoken languages of Jews of the Diaspora. A Yiddish theater group, the &quot;YiddishShpiel&quot;, in Tel Aviv, offers popular musical shows. Several leading Israeli artists have recorded songs in these languages, including an album in Ladino by Yehoram Gaon, and an album in Yiddish by Chava Alberstein.
Also, a number of new anthologies of Yiddish songs have been compiled, including a seven-volume anthology edited by Sinai Leichter, published by the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

===Music of migrant workers===
In 2006, there were an estimated 165,000 migrant workers in Israel. They come from the Philippines, Thailand, India, China, Africa, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere. Each community of migrant workers has its own musical culture. A visitor to the neighborhood of the Central bus station in Tel Aviv will hear strains of popular music from Addis Ababa, Bangkok, and Manila. Foreign workers also have their local popular music groups, that perform at parties and on holidays.

== Music education ==
Israel offers myriad opportunities to study music, from early childhood through adulthood. Music education in Israel enjoys government support, a vestige from the pre-state days when musicmaking was seen as a tool for teaching Hebrew to new immigrants and building a national ethos.

The Israel Ministry of Education supports 41 music conservatories throughout the country. Conservatories offer programs for all ages. One of the most notable of these is the Stricker Conservatory of Tel Aviv, which, besides offering lessons and courses, sponsors a number of concert series and master classes by visiting artists.

A number of institutions of higher education offer degrees in music and musicology. In addition to the two music academies in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, both Tel Aviv University and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem offer advanced degrees in musicology. The Hebrew University is also home to the Jewish Music Research Center. Bar-Ilan University has BA, MA and PhD programs in musicology and a program in music therapy; in 2007, its Safed College opened a three-year program in ethnic music including Klezmer, Hassidic, Western and Eastern music styles. Levinsky College offers a teaching certificate of a BA degree in music education.

The Rimon School of Jazz and Contemporary Music, founded in 1985, is Israel&#x27;s only school for jazz, R&amp;B, bebop, rock, and pop music. Many of its graduates have gone on to become well-known music professionals and performers.

Music education does not end with degree programs. Israel offers numerous opportunities for adult musicians to continue learning and performing, even if they do not pursue this as a career. There are two organizations for amateur chamber music players – The Israel Chamber Music Club, for string players, and Yanshuf for wind players. There are more than 20 community orchestras scattered throughout Israel for amateur musicians.

==Music and politics==
Israel is a country deeply riven by political differences, and music has often become associated with different political factions. Gush Emunim supporters have taken a repertoire of old religious songs and invested them with political meaning. An example is the song &quot;Utsu Etsu VeTufar&quot; (They gave counsel but their counsel was violated). The song signifies the ultimate rightness of those steadfast in their beliefs, suggesting the rightness of Gush Emunim&#x27;s struggle against anti-settlement policy by the government.

In 1967 war, Israel annexed Arab neighborhoods surrounding Jerusalem, a move widely supported at the time, but which has engendered controversy since. A few weeks before the war, Naomi Shemer wrote Jerusalem of Gold, sung by Shuli Natan, extolling the beauties of Jerusalem. That song, and others by Naomi Shemer have become associated with those in Israel who believe that Israel has no obligation to forgo territories occupied in 1967.

In February 1994, Kach supporter Baruch Goldstein massacred 29 Arab worshipers in the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron. While the act was universally condemned by the Israeli establishment, some extremists praised it. See, for example, &quot;HaTevach: Madrih Munahim&quot;, in &quot;Yediot Aharonot&quot;. After the massacre, members of the utra-right Kach movement adopted &quot;Barukh HaGever&quot;, a song often played at Jewish weddings with its own line dance, because the Hebrew title can be interpreted as &quot;Blessed be the Man&quot; or &quot;Baruch the Hero.&quot;
Minutes before Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was murdered at a political rally in November 1995, Israeli folk singer Miri Aloni sang the Israeli pop song &quot;Shir Lashalom&quot; (Song for Peace). This song, originally written in 1969 and performed extensively by the &quot;Lahaqot Tsvayiot&quot; at the time, has become one of the anthems of the Israeli peace camp.

During the Arab uprising known as the First Intifada, Israeli singer Si Heyman sang &quot;Yorim VeBokhim&quot; (Shoot and Weep) to protest Israeli policy in the territories. This song was banned briefly by the state-run radio, but later became popular.

Since the onset of the Oslo Process and, more recently, Israel&#x27;s unilateral disengagement plan, protest songs became a major avenue for opposition activists to express sentiments. Songs protesting these policies were written and performed by Israeli musicians, such as Ariel Zilber, Shalom Flisser, Aharon Razel, Eli Bar-Yahalom, Yuri Lipmanovich, Ari Ben-Yam, and many others.

<doc id="413618" wikidata="Q1672398" url="?curid=413618" title="Music of Iran">
<text>The music of Iran encompasses music produced by Iranian artists. In addition to the traditional folk and classical genres, it also includes pop and other celebrated styles such as jazz, rock, and hip hop.

Iranian music influenced many other cultures in West Asia, building up much of the musical terminology of the neighboring Turkic and Arabic cultures, and reached India through the 16th-century Persianate Mughal Empire, whose court promoted new musical forms by bringing Iranian musicians.

==History==
===Earliest records===
Music in Iran, as evidenced by the &quot;pre-Iranian&quot; archaeological records of Elam, the oldest civilization in southwestern Iran, dates back thousands of years. Iran is the birthplace of the earliest complex instruments, which date back to the third millennium BC. A number of trumpets made of silver, gold, and copper were found in eastern Iran that are attributed to the Oxus civilization and date back between 2200 and 1750 BC. The use of both vertical and horizontal angular harps have been documented at the archaeological sites of Madaktu (650 BC) and Kul-e Fara (900–600 BC), with the largest collection of Elamite instruments documented at Kul-e Fara. Multiple depictions of horizontal harps were also sculpted in Assyrian palaces, dating back between 865 and 650 BC.

===Classical antiquity===

Little is known about music in the classical Iranian empires of the Medes, the Achaemenids, and the Parthians apart from what can be gleaned from the comments of Greek historians. According to Herodotus, the magi, who were a priestly caste in ancient Iran, accompanied their sacrifice rituals with singing. Athenaeus of Naucratis, in his &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot;, mentions a court singer who had sung a warning to the king of the Median Empire of the plans of Cyrus the Great, who would later establish the Achaemenid dynasty. Athenaeus also notes the capture of singing girls at the court of the last Achaemenid king Darius III (336–330 BC) by Macedonian general Parmenion. Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; mentions a great number of singing women at the court of the Achaemenid Empire. Under the Parthian Empire, the &quot;gōsān&quot; (Parthian for &quot;minstrel&quot;) had a prominent role in society. They performed for their audiences at royal courts and in public theaters. According to Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Crassus&quot; (32.3), they praised their national heroes and ridiculed their Roman rivals. Likewise, Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geographica&quot; reports that the Parthian youth were taught songs about &quot;the deeds both of the gods and of the noblest men&quot;. Parthian songs were later absorbed into the Iranian national epic of &quot;Šhāhnāmeh&quot;, composed by 10th-century Persian poet Ferdowsi. itself was based on (Khwaday-Namag), an earlier Middle Persian work, which was an important part of Persian folklore and that is now lost. It is also mentioned in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Crassus&quot; (23.7) that the Parthians used drums to prepare for battle.

Under the reign of the Sasanians, the Middle Persian term was used to refer to a minstrel. The history of Sasanian music is better documented than earlier periods, and is especially evident in Avestan texts. The recitation of the Sasanian Avestan text of &quot;Vendidād&quot; has been connected to the Oxus trumpet. The Zoroastrian paradise itself was known as the &quot;House of Song&quot; ( in Middle Persian), &quot;where music induced perpetual joy&quot;. Musical instruments were not accompanied with formal Zoroastrian worship, but they were used in the festivals. Sasanian musical scenes are depicted especially on silver vessels and some wall reliefs.

The reign of Sasanian ruler Khosrow II is regarded as a &quot;golden age&quot; for Iranian music. He is shown among his musicians on a large relief at the archaeological site of Taq-e Bostan, holding a bow and arrows himself and standing in a boat amidst a group of harpists. The relief depicts two boats that are shown at &quot;two successive moments within the same panel&quot;. The court of Khosrow II hosted a number of prominent musicians, including Azad, Bamshad, Barbad, Nagisa, Ramtin, and Sarkash. Among these attested names, Barbad is remembered in many documents and has been named as remarkably highly skilled. He was a poet-musician who performed on occasions such as state banquets and the festivals of Nowruz and Mehrgan. He may have invented the lute and the musical tradition that gave rise to dastgah and maqam. He has been credited to have organized a musical system consisting of seven &quot;royal modes&quot; (), 30 derived modes (), and 360 melodies (). These numbers are in accordance with the number of days in a week, month, and year in the Sasanian calendar. The theories these modal systems were based on are not known. However, writers of later periods have left a list of these modes and melodies. Some of them are named after epic figures, such as (&quot;Vengeance of Iraj&quot;), (&quot;Vengeance of Siavash&quot;), and (&quot;Throne of Ardashir&quot;), some are named in honor of the Sasanian royal court, such as (&quot;Garden of Shirin&quot;), (&quot;Garden of the Sovereign&quot;), and (&quot;Seven Treasures&quot;), and some are named after nature, such as (&quot;Bright Light&quot;).

===Middle Ages===
The academic classical music of Iran, in addition to preserving melody types that are attributed to Sasanian musicians, is based on the theories of sonic aesthetics expounded by Avicenna, Farabi, Qotb-ed-Din Shirazi, and Safi-ed-Din Urmawi.

Two prominent Iranian musicians who lived under reign of the third Arab caliphate were Ebrahim Mawseli and his son Eshaq Mawseli. Zaryab of Baghdad, a student of Eshaq, is credited with influencing Spain&#x27;s classical Andalusian music.

The ninth century Persian poet Rudaki, who lived under the reign of the Samanids, set his own poems to music. At the court of the Persianate Ghaznavid dynasty, who ruled Iran between 977 and 1186, 10th-century Persian poet Farrokhi Sistani composed songs together with songster Andalib and tanbur player Buqi. Lute player Mohammad Barbati and songstress Setti Zarrin-kamar also entertained the Ghaznavid rulers at their court.

===Modern era===

In the post-medieval era, musical performances continued to be observed and promoted through especially princely courts, Sufi orders, and modernizing social forces. Under the reign of the 19th-century Qajar dynasty, Iranian music was renewed through the development of classical melody types (radif), that is the basic repertoire of Iran&#x27;s classical music, and the introduction of modern technologies and principles that were introduced from the West. Mirza Abdollah, a prominent tar and setar master and one of the most respected musicians of the court of the late Qajar period, is considered a major influence on the teaching of classical Iranian music in Iran&#x27;s contemporary conservatories and universities. Radif, the repertoire that he developed in the 19th century, is the oldest documented version of the seven dastgah system, and is regarded as a rearrangement of the older 12 maqam system.

Ali-Naqi Vaziri, a respected player of numerous Iranian and western instruments who studied western musical theory and composition in Europe, was one of the most prominent and influential musicians of the late Qajar and early Pahlavi periods. He established a private music school in 1924, where he also created a school orchestra composed of his students, formed by a combination of the tar and some western instruments. Vaziri then founded an association named &quot;Music Club&quot; (), formed by a number of progressive-minded writers and scholars, where the school orchestra performed concerts that were conducted by himself. He was an extraordinary figure among the Iranian musicians of the 20th century, and his primary goal was to provide music for ordinary citizens through a public arena. The Tehran Symphony Orchestra () was founded by Gholamhossein Minbashian in 1933. It was reformed by Parviz Mahmoud in 1946, and is currently the oldest and largest symphony orchestra in Iran. Later, Ruhollah Khaleqi, a student of Vaziri, established the Society for National Music () in 1949. Numerous musical compositions were produced within the parameters of classical Iranian modes, and many involved western musical harmonies. Iranian folkloric songs and poems of both classical and contemporary Iranian poets were incorporated for the arrangement of orchestral pieces that would bear the new influences.

Prior to the 1950s, Iran&#x27;s music industry was dominated by classical artists. New western influences were introduced into the popular music of Iran by the 1950s, with electric guitar and other imported characteristics accompanying the indigenous instruments and forms, and the popular music developed by the contributions of artists such as Viguen, who was known as the &quot;Sultan&quot; of Iranian pop and jazz music. Viguen was one of Iran&#x27;s first musicians to perform with a guitar.

Following the 1979 Revolution, the music industry of Iran went under a strict supervision, and pop music was prohibited for almost two decades. Women were banned from singing as soloists for male audiences. In the 1990s, the new regime began to produce and promote pop music in a new standardized framework, in order to compete with the abroad and unsanctioned sources of Iranian music. Under the presidency of Reformist Khatami, as a result of easing cultural restrictions within Iran, a number of new pop singers emerged from within the country. Since the new administration took office, the Ministry of Ershad adopted a different policy, mainly to make it easier to monitor the industry. The newly adopted policy included loosening restrictions for a small number of artists, while tightening it for the rest. However, the number of album releases increased.

The emergence of Iranian hip hop in the 2000s also resulted in major movements and influences in the music of Iran.
==Genres==
===Classical music===
The classical music of Iran consists of melody types developed through the country&#x27;s classical and medieval eras. Dastgah, a musical mode in Iran&#x27;s classical music, despite its popularity, has always been the preserve of the elite. The influence of dastgah is seen as the reservoir of authenticity that other forms of musical genres derive melodic and performance inspiration from.

===Folk music===
Iran&#x27;s folk, ceremonial, and popular songs might be considered &quot;vernacular&quot; in the sense that they are known and appreciated by a major part of the society (as opposed to the art music, which caters for the most part to more elite social classes). The variance of the folk music of Iran has often been stressed, in accordance to the cultural diversity of the country&#x27;s local and ethnic groups.

Iranian folk songs are categorized in various themes, including those of historical, social, religious, and nostalgic contexts. There are also folk songs that apply to particular occasions, such as weddings and harvests, as well as lullabies, children&#x27;s songs, and riddles.

There are several traditional specialists of folk music in Iran. Professional folk instrumentalists and vocalists perform at formal events such as weddings. Storytellers (; ) would recite epic poetry, such as that of the , using traditional melodic forms, interspersing with spoken commentary, which is a practice found also in Central Asian and Balkan traditions. The bakshy (), wandering minstrels who play the dotar, entertain their audiences at social gatherings with romantic ballads about warriors and warlords. There are also lament singers (), who recite verses that would commemorate the martyrdom of religious figures.

Iranian singers of both classical and folk music may improvise the lyric and the melody within the proper musical mode. Many Iranian folk songs have the potential of being adapted into major or minor tonalities, and therefore, a number of Iranian folk songs were arranged for orchestral accompaniment.

Many of Iran&#x27;s old folkloric songs were revitalized through a project developed by the Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults, a cultural and educational institute that was founded under the patronage of Iran&#x27;s former empress Farah Pahlavi in 1965. They were produced in a collection of quality recordings, performed by professional vocalists such as Pari Zanganeh, Monir Vakili, and Minu Javan, and were highly influential in Iran&#x27;s both folk and pop music productions.

===Symphonic music===

Iran&#x27;s symphonic music, as observed in the modern times, was developed by the late Qajar and early Pahlavi periods. In addition to instrumental compositions, some of Iran&#x27;s symphonic pieces are based on the country&#x27;s folk songs, and some are based on poetry of both classical and contemporary Iranian poets.

&quot;Symphonische Dichtungen aus Persien&quot; (&quot;Symphonic Poems from Persia&quot;), a collection of Persian symphonic works, was performed by the German Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Iranian conductor Ali Rahbari in 1980.

Loris Tjeknavorian, an acclaimed Iranian Armenian composer and conductor, composed &quot;Rostam and Sohrab&quot;, an opera with Persian libretto that is based on the tragedy of &quot;Rostam and Sohrab&quot; from Iran&#x27;s long epic poem &quot;Šāhnāme&quot;, in over two decades. It was first performed by the Tehran Symphony Orchestra at Tehran&#x27;s Roudaki Hall in December 2003.
Alexander Rahbari is an important conductor and composer who has mor than 250 published albums and conducted more than 450 orchestras,he is now conductor of Mariinsky theatre&#x27;s Orchestra

In 2005, the Persepolis Orchestra (Melal Orchestra) played a piece that dates back 3000 years. The notes of this piece, which were discovered among some ancient inscriptions, were deciphered by archaeologists and are believed to have belonged to the Sumerians and the ancient Greeks. Renowned Iranian musician Peyman Soltani conducted the orchestra.

===Pop music===
Following the emergence of radio, under the reign of the Qajar dynasty, a form of popular music was formed and began to develop in Iran. Later, the arrival of new western influences, such as the use of the guitar and other western instruments, marked a turning point in Iran&#x27;s popular music by the 1950s. Iranian pop music is commonly performed by vocalists who are accompanied with elaborate ensembles, often using a combination of both indigenous Iranian and European instruments.

The pop music of Iran is largely promoted through mass media, but it experienced some decade of prohibition after the 1979 Revolution. Public performances were also banned, but they have been occasionally permitted since 1990. The pop music of Iranian diasporan communities has also been significant.

===Jazz and blues music===
Jazz music was introduced into Iran&#x27;s popular music by the emergence of artists such as Viguen, who was known as Iran&#x27;s &quot;Sultan of Jazz&quot;. Viguen&#x27;s first song, &quot;Moonlight&quot;, which was released in 1954, was an instant hit on the radio and is considered highly influential.

Indigenous Iranian elements, such as classical musical forms and poetry, have also been incorporated into Iranian jazz. Rana Farhan, an Iranian jazz and blues singer living in New York, combines classical Persian poetry with modern jazz and blues. Her best-known work, &quot;Drunk With Love&quot;, is based on a poem by prominent 13th-century Persian poet Rumi. Jazz and blues artists who work in post-revolutionary Iran have also gained popularity.

===Rock music===
Rock music was introduced into Iran&#x27;s popular music by the 1960s, together with the emergence of other Western European and American musical genres. It soon became popular among the young generation, especially at the nightclubs of Tehran. In post-revolutionary Iran, many rock music artists are not officially sanctioned and have to rely on the Internet and underground scenes.

In 2008, power metal band Angband signed with German record label Pure Steel Records as the first Iranian metal band to release internationally through a European label. They had collaborations with well-known producer Achim Köhler.

===Hip hop===
Iranian hip hop emerged by the 2000s, from the country&#x27;s capital city, Tehran. It started with underground artists recording mixtapes influenced by the American hip hop culture, and was later combined with elements from the indigenous Iranian musical forms.

===A cappella===
Iranian A cappella (music without instrument) in 2011 with a new type was first introduced by Damour Vocal Band led by Faraz Khosravi Danesh. This genre of music has been performed as a choir in the past, but since 2011 it has become such that the human larynx has replaced musical instruments. Various groups, including the Tehran Vocal Ensemble, began to operate after that, and this style of music flowed in a creative and new way in the Iranian A cappella music.

<text>Persian traditional music or Iranian traditional music, also known as Persian classical music or Iranian classical music, refers to the classical music of Iran (historically known as &quot;Persia&quot;). It consists of characteristics developed through the country&#x27;s classical, medieval, and contemporary eras. It also influenced areas and regions that are considered part of Greater Iran.

Due to the exchange of musical science throughout history, many of Iran&#x27;s classical modes are related to those of its neighboring cultures.

Iran&#x27;s classical art music continues to function as a spiritual tool, as it has throughout history, and much less of a recreational activity. It belongs, for the most part, to the social elite, as opposed to the folkloric and popular music, in which the society as a whole participates. However, components of Iran&#x27;s classical music have also been incorporated into folk and pop music compositions.

==History==
The history of musical development in Iran dates back thousands of years. Archaeological records attributed to &quot;pre-Iranian&quot; civilizations, such as those of Elam in the southwest and of Oxus in the northeast, demonstrate musical traditions in prehistoric times.
Little is known about the music of the classical Iranian empires of the Medes, the Achaemenids, and the Parthians. However, an elaborate musical scene is revealed through various fragmentary documents, including those that were observed at the court and in public theaters and those that accompanied religious rituals and battle preparations. Jamshid, a king in Iranian mythology, is credited with the &quot;invention&quot; of music.


The history of Sasanian music is better documented than the earlier periods, and the names of various instruments and court musicians from the reign of the Sasanians have been attested. Under the Sasanian rule, modal music was developed by a poet-musician of the court named Barbad, who is remembered in many documents. He may have invented the lute and the musical tradition that was to transform into the forms of dastgah and maqam. He has been credited to have organized a musical system consisting of seven &quot;royal modes&quot; (), 30 derived modes (), and 360 melodies ().

Khosrau II was a great patron of music, and his court musician, Barbod, was said to have developed a musical system with seven modal structures (known as the Royal Modes), thirty derivative modes, and 365 melodies, associated with the days of the week, month and year&quot;.

Iran&#x27;s academic classical music, in addition to preserving melody types attributed to Sasanian musicians, is based on the theories of sonic aesthetics as expounded by the likes of Iranian musical theorists in the early centuries of after the Muslim conquest of the Sasanian Empire, most notably Avicenna, Farabi, Qotb-ed-Din Shirazi, and Safi-ed-Din Urmawi. 

It is also linked directly to the music of the 16th–18th-century Safavid Empire. During the 19th-century Qajar era, the classical melody types were developed, alongside the introduction of modern technologies and principles from the West. Mirza Abdollah, a prominent tar and setar master and one of the most respected musicians of the court of the late Qajar period, is considered a major influence on the teaching of classical Iranian music in Iran&#x27;s contemporary conservatories and universities. Radif, the repertoire that he developed in the 19th century, is the oldest documented version of the seven dastgah system, and is regarded as a rearrangement of the older 12 maqam system. During the late Qajar and the early Pahlavi eras, numerous musical compositions were produced within the parameters of classical Iranian modes, and many involved western musical harmonies.

The introduction and popularity of western musical influences in the early contemporary era was criticized by traditionalists, who felt that traditional music was becoming endangered. It was prior to the 1950s that Iran&#x27;s music industry was dominated by classical musicians. In 1968, Dariush Safvat and Nur-Ali Borumand helped form an institution called the &quot;Center for Preservation and Propagation of Iranian Music&quot;, with the help of Reza Ghotbi, director of the National Iranian Radio and Television, an act that is credited with saving traditional music in the 1970s.

The &quot;Radif of Iranian music&quot; was officially inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2009, described as &quot;the traditional repertoire of the classical music of Iran&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Iran&#x27;s classical art music relies on both improvisation and composition, and is based on a series of modal scales and tunes including twelve Dastgahs and Avazes. Compositions can vary immensely from start to finish, usually alternating between low, contemplative pieces and athletic displays of musicianship called . The common repertoire consists of more than 200 short melodic motions (), which are classified into seven modes (). Two of these modes have secondary modes branching from them that are called . This whole body is called , of which there are several versions, each in accordance with the teachings of a particular master ().

By the end of the Safavid Empire, more complex musical movements in 10, 14, and 16 beats stopped being performed. In the early Qajar era, the rhythmic cycles () were replaced by a meter based on the qazal, and the maqam system of classification was reconstructed into the radif system. Today, rhythmic pieces are performed in beats of 2 to 7, with some exceptions. The are always in a time frame.

A typical Iranian classical performance consists of five parts, namely (&quot;prelude&quot;; a composed metric piece), (a fast, metric piece with a repeated rhythmic pattern), (the improvised central piece),  (a composed metric song of classical poetry), and (a rhythmic closing composition). A performance forms a sort of suite. Unconventionally, these parts may be varied or omitted.

Iran&#x27;s classical art music is vocal based, and the vocalist plays a crucial role, as he or she decides what mood to express and which dastgah relates to that mood. In many cases, the vocalist is also responsible for choosing the lyrics. If the performance requires a singer, the singer is accompanied by at least one wind or string instrument, and at least one type of percussion. There could be an ensemble of instruments, though the primary vocalist must maintain his or her role. In some tasnif songs, the musicians may accompany the singer by singing along several verses.

The incorporation of religious texts as lyrics has largely been replaced by the works of medieval Sufi poets, especially Hafez and Rumi.

==Instruments==

Indigenous Iranian musical instruments used in the traditional music include string instruments such as the chang (harp), qanun, santur, rud (oud, barbat), tar, dotar, setar, tanbur, and kamanche, wind instruments such as the sorna (zurna, karna), ney, and neyanban, and percussion instruments such as the tombak, kus, daf (dayere), naqare, and dohol.

Some instruments, such as the sorna, neyanban, dohol, and naqare, are usually not used in the classical repertoire, but are used in the folk music. Up until the middle of the Safavid Empire, the chang was an important part of Iranian music. It was then replaced by the qanun (zither), and later by the western piano. The tar functions as the primary string instrument in a performance. The setar is especially common among Sufi musicians. The western violin is also used, with an alternative tuning preferred by Iranian musicians. The ghaychak, that is a type of fiddle, is being re-introduced to the classical music after many years of exclusion.

<text>A Bible box is a small container that is used to store a bible. About the size of a bible, this box could be used to transport in safety what was a very costly book. Many varieties had a slanted or angled top with a lower lip, meant to hold the Bible for reading when the box was placed on a table. In a sense it then served as a portable lectern. Over the years the typical Bible box was also used or specifically built to contain writing implements such as a quill, ink pot, blotting paper and writing paper. The level or slanted surface of the box then served as a desktop for writing as well as reading.

In much of Europe this kind of box was produced in many different materials, such as wood, metal or ceramics, in simple or extremely ornate styles. Bible boxes were popular in the 17th century. Many of the more refined examples can be found in museums.

In Colonial America, this container was produced locally in a great variety of styles and finishes, by amateurs and professionals.

The term &quot;Bible box&quot; is sometimes wrongly used in the United States to qualify antique objects which are in fact simple portable desks with no biblical connection. A more modern, cheaper and more portable version of the bible box is the bible case.

<doc id="413643" wikidata="Q1471995" url="?curid=413643" title="Former Qin">
<text>Qin, known as the Former Qin and Fu Qin (苻秦) in historiography, was a dynastic state of China ruled by the Fu (Pu) clan of the Di peoples during the Sixteen Kingdoms period. Founded in the wake of the Later Zhao dynasty&#x27;s collapse in 351, it completed the unification of northern China in 376 during the reign of Fu Jiān (Emperor Xuanzhao), being the only state of the Sixteen Kingdoms to achieve so. Its capital was Chang&#x27;an up to Fu Jiān&#x27;s death in 385. The prefix &quot;Former&quot; is used to distinguish it from the Later Qin and Western Qin dynasties that were founded later.

In 383, the severe defeat of the Former Qin by the Jin dynasty at the Battle of Fei River encouraged uprisings, splitting Former Qin territory into two noncontiguous pieces after the death of Fu Jiān. One remnant, at present-day Taiyuan, Shanxi was soon overwhelmed in 386 by the Xianbei under the Later Yan, Western Yan and the Dingling. The other struggled in greatly reduced territories around the border of present-day Shaanxi and Gansu until its final disintegration in 394 following years of invasions by Western Qin and Later Qin.

All rulers of Former Qin proclaimed themselves &quot;Emperor&quot;, except for Fu Jiān who only claimed the title &quot;Heavenly King&quot; (&quot;Tian Wang&quot;). He was nonetheless posthumously considered an emperor by the Former Qin imperial court.

== History ==

=== Background ===
The Fu clan of Lüeyang Commandery were originally had the surname Pu (蒲) and claimed descent from the legendary Youhu tribe (有扈) that once dwelled near Chang&#x27;an during the Xia dynasty according to records. During the fall of Western Jin, many refugees fled to join them, prompting their chieftain, Pu Hong to declare independence by proclaiming himself the Duke of Lüeyang. He became a vassal after the Former Zhao dynasty entered the Guanzhong region, and later submitted to the Jie-led Later Zhao dynasty after they vanquished the former in 329. When Shi Hu seized power in 333, Pu Hong convinced him to resettle the various Di and Qiang tribes in Guanzhong to live around the capital region in Xiangguo. Pu Hong and his family were moved to Fangtou (枋頭, in modern Hebi, Henan), where he supervised the Di tribes as the Colonel Who Protects the Di (護氐校尉) and was highly favoured as a general and advisor by Shi Hu.

After Shi Hu&#x27;s death in 349, Pu Hong was involved in instigating the Later Zhao princes&#x27; internecine struggle for the throne by supporting Shi Zun against Shi Shi. He then took advantage of the confusion to lead his armies west towards Guanzhong, where he planned to establish an independent state. In accordance to a prophecy, he changed his family name to Fu (苻) and, after briefly being a vassal to the Eastern Jin dynasty, proclaimed himself King of the Three Qins. However, en route, he was assassinated by one of his generals. 

Fu Hong&#x27;s son and heir, Fu Jiàn, quickly quelled the rebellion and succeeded his father. Initially, he renounced his father&#x27;s imperial titles and redeclared himself as a Jin vassal, but once he captured the ancient capital of Chang&#x27;an, he declared independence from Jin by claiming the title of Heavenly King of Qin.

=== Reign of Fu Jiàn and Fu Sheng ===
Fu Jiàn further elevated himself to Emperor of Qin in 352. During his reign, he expanded his state by defeating remnants of the Later Zhao and wresting for control over the Longxi region with the Former Liang. His most serious challenge was in 354, when the Eastern Jin dynasty commander, Huan Wen launched his first northern expedition against them. Fu Jiàn barely repelled him using a scorched earth strategy, and during the battle, his crown prince, Fu Chang (苻萇), was killed. 

Not long after, Fu Jiàn died in 355 and was succeeded by his son Fu Sheng. Traditional historians describe Fu Sheng as a violent ruler, killing many of his high-ranking officials over trivial matters. During his reign, he forced the Former Liang into submission and killed the Qiang warlord, Yao Xiang. However, as he planned to have his cousins killed, he was overthrown in a coup in 357 led his cousin, Fu Jiān (note the different pinyin from his uncle and first ruler, Fu Jiàn).

=== Rise of Fu Jiān and unification of northern China ===
After Fu Jiān ascended the throne, he changed the imperial title back to Heavenly King. Although a Di, he had a strong background in Confucian education and employed many Han Chinese officials, the most prominent being his Prime Minister, Wang Meng. With the help of Wang Meng, Fu Jiān shifted the state&#x27;s initial dependence on mercantile towards agrarian policies by promoting agriculture, building irrigation facilities along with resettling the Xiongnu and Xianbei people to work on the farmlands. Imperial power was centralized by reorganizing the bureaucracy and cracking down on powerful, corrupt nobles and officials. He also emphasized education and restored many of the traditional Chinese rituals.

Fu Jiān&#x27;s early reign dealt with internal revolts by his dukes and vassal warlords, but by 368, these issues had largely been dealt with. At the time, his main rivals were the Former Yan to the east, led by the Murong-Xianbei, and the Eastern Jin in the south. In 369, taking advantage of Former Yan&#x27;s vulnerability, Former Qin forces led by Wang Meng launched an invasion, and by the end of 370, all of Yan was conquered. In 371, Qin conquered Chouchi, and in 373, they captured Sichuan from Jin. Qin&#x27;s unification of northern China was completed in 376, when they conquered Former Liang and Dai. Fu Jiān treated his defeated enemies with leniency and allowed them to serve in his administration.

Former Qin also began receiving envoys from various states including Silla and Goguryeo. While upholding Confucianism, Fu Jiān also expressed interest in Buddhism. In 379, he welcomed the Buddhist monk, Dao&#x27;an into his court and made him a political advisor. In 382, he sent his Di general, Lü Guang on an expedition to the Western Regions while requesting that he bring him Kumārajīva, a monk from Kucha.

=== Battle of Fei River ===
The Eastern Jin was the last state in the way of Former Qin&#x27;s unification of China. Wang Meng died in 375, and before his death, he warned Fu Jiān against going to war with Jin. He instead advised him to focus on consolidating his territory, as many of his conquered people, particularly the Qiang and Xianbei, were not fully loyal to his regime. However, Fu Jiān did not listen, and to address Wang Meng&#x27;s latter concern, he relocated many of the Qiang and Xianbei people to live near the capital while moving the Di to newly-controlled territories, hoping to integrate the various ethnic groups. 

In 378, Former Qin forces besieged Xiangyang and attacked Pengcheng. Although Xiangyang fell to Qin in 379, the assault on Pengcheng was defeated by the Jin general, Xie Xuan. In 383, aiming to unify China and despite opposition from most of his ministers, Fu Jiān invaded Jin with a massive army, with records claiming to be at 1 million strong. The Former Qin captured Shouchun before facing the Jin army led by Xie An at the Battle of Fei River. During the battle, Zhu Xu, a Former Qin general who had been captured from Jin, betrayed Fu Jiān by shouting &quot;The Qin army is defeated!&quot;, causing widespread panic among the soldiers. As the Qin soldiers fled in disarray, the Jin army pursued and dealt them a disastrous defeat. Fu Jiān himself was injured in battle and barely escaped to the north.

=== Disintegration and fall ===
In 384, as Former Qin was recovering from the recent defeat, the Xianbei general and previous prince of Former Yan, Murong Chui, rebelled in the northeast, founding the Later Yan dynasty with the aim of restoring his family&#x27;s former state. Chui&#x27;s rebellion encouraged his nephew, Murong Hong, to revolt around Chang&#x27;an, and their state was known as the Western Yan. Fu Jiān attempted to quell the uprisings, but soon, his Qiang general, Yao Chang also rebelled north of the Wei River, founding the Later Qin dynasty. Fu Jiān was besieged in Chang&#x27;an by Western Yan forces and later fled the city due to the food shortages in 385. However, he was then captured by Yao Chang, who had him executed after he refused to formally pass the throne.

Rebellions continued to break out in other parts of the empire. In 385, the Qifu-Xianbei tribe formed the Western Qin dynasty in the Longxi and the Chouchi state was restored. In 386, Lü Guang, returning from the Western Regions, seized Liang province and founded the Later Liang, while the Tuoba-Xianbei restored their state of Dai, which later became known as the Northern Wei dynasty. Meanwhile, Xie Xuan led Eastern Jin forces to recover lost territory, pushing all the way to the Yellow River. Fu Jiān&#x27;s son, Fu Pi, declared himself emperor in 385 and sought to restore Former Qin&#x27;s authority from Jinyang in Bing province, but suffered a devastating defeat to the Western Yan. His brief reign came to an end after he was killed by Jin forces while trying to capture Luoyang in 386.

At Nan&#x27;an Commandery (南安郡; southeast of present-day Longxi County, Gansu) in the Guanzhong, a distant cousin of Fu Jiān, Fu Deng was acclaimed the new emperor after news of Fu Pi&#x27;s death. Throughout his reign, Fu Deng fought with the Later Qin, finding much success early on before suffering a significant defeat at the Battle of Dajie in 389. From then on, he was unable to launch anymore substantial campaigns. In 394, taking advantage of Yao Chang&#x27;s death, he carried out one last attack on Later Qin at the Battle of Feiqiao, where his main forces were destroyed. He was soon captured and executed by Yao Chang&#x27;s successor, Yao Xing. His son, Fu Chong, fled to Huangzhong (湟中, in modern Xining, Qinghai) and declared himself emperor, but not long after, Western Qin forces seized his remaining territory and killed him in battle, marking the formal end of the Former Qin dynasty. 

During the fall of Former Qin, the Fu clan became dispersed throughout China. Fu Hóng, a son of Fu Jiān, fled to the Eastern Jin, where he became a confidant of the usurper Huan Xuan before being killed in battle in 405. The Later Yan welcomed members of the Fu clan to surrender, with two of them, the sisters Fu Song&#x27;e and Fu Xunying, becoming empresses to the last ruler, Murong Xi. In Chouchi, Fu Chong&#x27;s son, Fu Xuan, was made a military general.

<text>Imam Shamil (; ; ; ; ; 26 June 1797 – 4 February 1871) was the political, military, and spiritual leader of North Caucasian resistance to Imperial Russia in the 1800s, the third Imam of the Caucasian Imamate (1840–1859), and a Sunni Muslim sheikh of the Naqshbandi Sufis.

==Family and early life==
Imam Shamil was born in 1797 into an Avar Muslim family. He was born in the small village (aul) of Gimry (present-day Dagestan, Russia). Some sources state that he had a paternal Kumyk lineage. He was originally named Ali, but following local tradition, his name was changed to &quot;Shamuyil&quot; (, equivalent to &quot;Samuel&quot;) when he became ill. This name is pronounced &quot;Shamil&quot; in the Caucasus, and contemporary sources called him by this name (either or in Arabic), although in his writings he always used the form &quot;Shamuyil&quot;. His father, Dengau, was a landlord, and this position allowed Shamil and his close friend Ghazi Muhammad to study many subjects, including Arabic and logic.

Shamil grew up at a time when the Russian Empire was expanding into the territories of the Ottoman Empire and Qajar Iran (see Russo-Persian War (1804–1813) and Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)). Many Caucasian peoples united in resistance to Russian imperial aspirations in what became known as the Caucasian War (1817-1864). Earlier leaders of Caucasian resistance included Hadji-Dawud, Sheikh Mansur and Ghazi Mollah. Shamil, a childhood friend of the Mollah, would become his disciple and counsellor.

Shamil had multiple wives, including one of Armenian ethnicity born in Russia named Anna Ivanovna Ulukhanova (or Ulykhanova; 1828-1877). Captured in a raid in 1840, she married Shamil six years later. She converted to Islam as a teenager and adopted the name Shuanet. Shuanet remained loyal to Shamil even after his capture and exile to Russia. After the death of Shamil (1871) she moved to the Ottoman Empire, where the sultan assigned her a pension.

== War against Russia ==


In 1832, Ghazi Mollah died at the battle of Gimry, and Shamil was one of only two Murids to escape, but he sustained severe wounds. During this fight he was stabbed with a bayonet. After reportedly jumping from an elevated stoop &quot;clean over the heads of the very line of soldiers about to fire on him ... [he landed] behind them, whirling his sword in his left hand he cut down three of them, but was bayoneted by the fourth, the steel plunging deep in his chest. He seized the bayonet, pulled it out of his own flesh, cut down the man, and with another superhuman leap, cleared the wall and vanished in the darkness&quot;. He went into hiding and both Russia and Murids assumed him dead. Once recovered, he emerged from hiding and rejoined the Murids, led by the second Imam, Hamzat Bek. He would wage unremitting warfare on the Russians for the next quarter century and become one of the legendary guerrilla commanders of the century. When Hamzat Bek was killed in 1834, Shamil took his place as the prime leader of the Caucasian resistance and the third Imam of the Caucasian Imamate.

In June–August 1839, Shamil and his followers, numbering about 4000 men, women and children, found themselves under siege in their mountain stronghold of Akhoulgo, nestled in the bend of the Andi Koysu, about ten miles east of Gimry. Under the command of General Pavel Grabbe, the Russian army trekked through lands devoid of supplies because of Shamil&#x27;s scorched-earth strategy. The geography of the stronghold protected it from three sides, adding to the difficulty of conducting the siege. Eventually the two sides agreed to negotiate. Complying with Grabbe&#x27;s demands, Shamil gave his son, Jamaldin, in a sign of good faith, as a hostage. Shamil rejected Grabbe&#x27;s proposal that Shamil command his forces to surrender and for him to accept exile from the region. The Russian army attacked the stronghold, after 2 days of fighting, the Russian troops had secured it. Shamil escaped the siege during the first night of the attack. Shamil&#x27;s forces had been broken and many Dagestani and Chechen chieftains proclaimed loyalty to the Tsar. Shamil fled Dagestan for Chechnya. There, he made quick work of extending his influence over the clans.

Shamil was effective at uniting the many, quarrelsome Caucasian tribes to fight against the Russians, by the force of his charisma, piety and fairness in applying Sharia law. One Russian source commented on him as &quot;a man of great tact and a subtle politician.&quot; He believed the Russian introduction of alcohol in the area corrupted traditional values. Against the large regular Russian military, Shamil made effective use of irregular and guerrilla tactics. In 1845, an 8000-10000 strong column under the command of Count Mikhail Vorontsov followed the Imamate&#x27;s forces into the forests of Chechnya. The Imamate&#x27;s forces surround the Russian column, destroying it. This destroyed Vorontsov&#x27;s attempt to cut away Chechnya from the Imamate which was his plan.

His fortunes as a military leader rose after he was joined by Hadji Murad, who defected from the Russians in 1841 and tripled by his fighting the area under Shamil&#x27;s control within a short time. Hadji Murad, who was to become the subject of a famous novella by Leo Tolstoy (1904), turned against Shamil a decade later, apparently disappointed by his failure to be anointed Shamil&#x27;s successor as imam. Shamil&#x27;s elder son was given that nomination, and in a secret council, Shamil had his lieutenant accused of treason and sentenced to death, on which Hadji Murad, on learning of the judgement, redefected to the Russians.

Although Shamil hoped that Britain, France, or the Ottoman Empire would come to his aid to drive Russia from the Caucasus, this never happened. After the Crimean War, Russia redoubled its efforts against the Imamate. Now successful, Russian forces severely reduced the Imamate&#x27;s territory, and by September 1859, Shamil surrendered. Though the main theater closed, conflict in the eastern Caucasus would continue for several more years.

== Last years ==
After his capture, Shamil was sent to Saint Petersburg to meet the Tsar Alexander II. Afterwards, he was exiled to Kaluga, then a small town near Moscow. After several years in Kaluga he complained to the authorities about the climate and in December 1868 Shamil received permission to move to Kyiv a commercial center of the Empire&#x27;s southwest. In Kyiv he was afforded a mansion in Aleksandrovskaya Street. The Imperial authorities ordered the Kyiv superintendent to keep Shamil under &quot;strict but not overly burdensome surveillance&quot; and allotted the city a significant sum for the needs of the exile. Shamil seemed to have liked his luxurious detainment, as well as the city; this is confirmed by the letters he sent from Kyiv.

In 1859 Shamil wrote to one of his sons: &quot;By the will of the Almighty, the Absolute Governor, I have fallen into the hands of unbelievers ... the Great Emperor ... has settled me here ... in a tall spacious house with carpets and all the necessities&quot;.

In 1869 he was given permission to perform the Hajj to the holy city of Mecca. He traveled first from Kyiv to Odesa and then sailed to Istanbul, where he was greeted by Ottoman Sultan Abdulaziz. He became a guest at the Imperial Topkapı Palace for a short while and left Istanbul on a ship reserved for him by the Sultan. In Mecca, during the pilgrimage, he met and conversed with Abdelkader El Djezairi. After completing his pilgrimage to Mecca, he died in Medina in 1871 while visiting the city, and was buried in the Jannatul Baqi, a historical graveyard in Medina where many prominent personalities from Islamic history are interred. Two elder sons, ( and Muhammed Şefi), whom he had to leave in Russia in order to get permission to visit Mecca, became officers in the Russian army, while two younger sons, ( and Muhammed Kamil), served in the Turkish army whilst their daughter Peet&#x27;mat Shamil went on to marry Sheikh Mansur Fedorov, an Imam who later absconded from the Russian Empire out of fear for himself and his children&#x27;s life. He fathered 11 children, one being John Fedorov who changed his name to John Federoff after migrating to Childers in Queensland, Australia where he established a sugar cane farming empire.

Said Shamil, a grandson of Imam Shamil, became one of the founders of the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus, which was founded in 1917 and survived until 1920, when it was conquered by Soviet Russia. Forced to leave the region, in 1924 he established the &quot;Committee of Independence of the Caucasus&quot; in Germany.

== Legacy ==
=== Russian historiography ===
While Russia had managed to conquer Chechnya and Dagestan in a series of bloody conquest, Russians had developed a great respect for Shamil. Tsar Alexander II of Russia had openly admired his resistance, thus in the later part of his life, Shamil was permitted for Hajj by the Russian authorities.

Shamil&#x27;s career and legacy continue to be studied by Russian authorities and academics despite his defiance to Russian power. An entomologist with reformist ideas named a large swift moth after him.

=== Musical composition ===
At a gathering in 1958, the Lubavitcher Rebbe told a story about a great tribal leader named Shamil, who was rebelling against the persecuting Russian forces. Lured by a false peace treaty, he was captured and exiled. During his exile, he composed a heartfelt, wordless song emoting his rise, downfall and yearning for freedom. The song was seemingly heard by a passing Hasid, the melody remained obscure until the Rebbe taught it at the above-mentioned gathering. The song uncharacteristically was adopted by the Chabad movement (who usually compose their own melodies), as they take the deeper meaning of its stanzas as an analogy for the soul, which descends to a world of mortality and physicality, trapped in a body, knowing that it will one day return to its maker. (Another song uncharacteristically adapted by the Chabad movement is the tune of the La Marseillaise, which was put to the tune of the prayer Ho&#x27;aderes V&#x27;hoemunah.)

<text>Amar Gopal Bose (November 2, 1929 – July 12, 2013) was an American entrepreneur and academic. An electrical engineer and sound engineer, he was a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for over 45 years. He was also the founder and chairman of Bose Corporation.

In 2011, he donated a majority of the company to MIT in the form of non-voting shares to sustain and advance MIT&#x27;s education and research mission.

== Early life and education ==
Bose was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to a Bengali father, Noni Gopal Bose and an American mother, Charlotte Mechlin (1895-1973). His mother was a schoolteacher of French and German ancestry. His father was an Indian independence activist who, having been imprisoned for his political activities, fled Bengal in the 1920s in order to avoid further persecution by the British colonial police.

Bose first displayed his entrepreneurial skills and his interest in electronics at age thirteen when, during the World War II years, he enlisted school friends as co-workers in a small home business repairing model trains and home radios, to supplement his family&#x27;s income.

After graduating from Abington Senior High School in Abington, Pennsylvania, Bose enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, graduating with a BS (Bachelor of Science) in Electrical Engineering in the early 1950s. Bose spent a year at Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium in Eindhoven, Netherlands; and a year as a Fulbright research student in New Delhi, India, where he met his future first wife. He completed his PhD in Electrical Engineering from MIT, writing a thesis on non-linear systems under the supervision of Norbert Wiener and Yuk-Wing Lee.

== Career ==
Following graduation, Bose became an assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During his early years as a professor, Bose purchased a high-end stereo system in 1956 and was disappointed to find that speakers with impressive technical specifications failed to reproduce the realism of a live performance. This would eventually motivate his extensive speaker technology research, concentrating on key weaknesses in the high-end speaker systems available at the time. His research on acoustics led him to develop a stereo loudspeaker that would reproduce, in a domestic setting, the dominantly reflected sound field that characterizes the listening space of the audience in a concert hall. His focus on psychoacoustics later became a hallmark of his company&#x27;s audio products.

For initial capital to fund his company in 1964, Bose turned to angel investors, including his MIT thesis advisor and professor, Yuk-Wing Lee. Bose was awarded significant patents in two fields that continue to be important to the Bose Corporation. These patents were in the area of loudspeaker design and non-linear, two-state modulated, Class-D power processing.

In the 1980s, Bose developed an electromagnetic replacement for automotive shock absorbers, intended to radically improve the performance of automotive suspension systems, absorbing bumps and road shock while controlling car body motions and sway.

In 2007, Bose was listed in Forbes 400 as the 271st richest man in the world, with a net worth of $1.8 billion. In 2009, he was no longer on the billionaires list, but returned to the list in 2011, with a net worth of $1.0 billion.

The company Bose founded employed 11,700 people worldwide and produces products for home, car, and professional audio, as well as conducting basic research in acoustics and other fields. Bose never took his company public, and since the company is privately held Bose was able to pursue risky long-term research. In a 2004 interview in &quot;Popular Science&quot; magazine, he said: &quot;I would have been fired a hundred times at a company run by MBAs. But I never went into business to make money. I went into business so that I could do interesting things that hadn&#x27;t been done before.&quot;

Bose said that his best ideas usually came to him in a flash. &quot;These innovations are not the result of rational thought; it&#x27;s an intuitive idea.&quot;

== Personal life ==
He married Prema Bose but they later divorced. They had two children. Later in life, he married Ursula Bolthauser. Bose did not practice any religion, though he used to meditate for a short while every day. His son Vanu Bose was the founder and CEO of Vanu Inc., a software-defined radio technology company.

Bose died on July 12, 2013, at the age of 83 in Wayland, Massachusetts.

== Teaching and legacy ==
In addition to running his company, Bose remained a professor at MIT until 2001. He earned the Baker Teaching Award in 1963–64, and further teaching awards over the years. The Bose Award for Excellence in Teaching (1989), and later the Junior Bose Award (1995) were established in his honor, to recognize outstanding teaching in the MIT School of Engineering. Former students have stated that his classes helped them gain life skills and problem solving skills that have served them throughout their careers.

Bose was the doctoral advisor to MIT professor Alan V. Oppenheim, who is well known for his work on digital signal processing and his books on signals and systems. Oppenheim dedicated one of his books to Bose and described him with these words: &quot;What I learned from him about teaching, research, and life over the many decades of our relationship affected me in ways too numerous to describe. He set the highest standards in everything that he did, and his accomplishments as a teacher, an inventor, and an entrepreneur are legendary.&quot;

In 2011, Bose donated a majority of the company&#x27;s non-voting shares to MIT on the condition that the shares never be sold. Because these shares are non-voting, MIT does not participate in operations or governance of Bose Corporation.

== Honors and awards ==
* Fellow, IEEE, 1972 – for contributions to loudspeaker design, two-state amplifier-modulators, and nonlinear systems.
* Honorary member, Audio Engineering Society, 1985.

<text>McMenamins is a family-owned chain of brewpubs, breweries, music venues, historic hotels, and theater pubs in the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington. Many of their locations are in rehabilitated historical properties; several are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
McMenamins was founded by brothers Mike and Brian McMenamin, who were raised in northeast Portland. They trace the beginning of McMenamins to the 1974 opening of Produce Row Café. In 1985, McMenamins opened Oregon&#x27;s first brewpub in southwest Portland&#x27;s Hillsdale neighborhood. Their first theater pub was the Mission Theater &amp; Pub (1987). By 1997, food accounted for over half of McMenamins&#x27; total sales.

Approximately 3,000 staff were laid off upon the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. While still primarily family-owned, in May 2020 McMenamins began raising $20 million from private investors in a Preferred Stock Offering to retire short-term debt as a result of COVID-19 shutdowns, to fund &quot;secret projects&quot; and to enable future expansion. This was the first time the company had opened direct investment in McMenamins, Inc. to those outside the McMenamin family. The private equity offering conferred preferred shares at $100,000 each in private placements to 150 to 200 high-income individuals. The shares do not carry voting rights for their holders but McMenamins indicated that investors could expect a 3 percent annual cumulative dividend and a 6.5 percent overall return. The decision to open McMenamins to outside investors was in-part driven by impacts from COVID-19 with total revenue for McMenamins down 50 percent in the first 5 months of 2020.

McMenamins was the victim of a ransomware attack in 2021. In 2022, McMenamins had 62 hotels, theaters, and eateries in Oregon and Washington, as well as approximately 2,700 employees. The business was valued at approximately $180 million in 2024.

== Notable establishments and properties ==

<doc id="413663" wikidata="Q577902" url="?curid=413663" title="Magen David Adom">
<text>The Magen David Adom (, abbr. MDA, pronounced &quot;MAH-dah&quot; per its Hebrew acronym, ) is Israel&#x27;s national emergency medical, disaster, ambulance and blood bank service. The literal meaning of name is &quot;Red Shield of David,&quot; but the symbol is more frequently called the &quot;Red Star of David&quot; in many languages. Since June 2006, Magen David Adom has been officially recognized by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) as the national aid society of the State of Israel under the Geneva Conventions, and a member of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. MDA has a dedicated medical emergency phone number in Israel, 101.
MDA can become an auxiliary arm of the Israel Defense Forces during times of war. In 2022, MDA became academically affiliated with Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. Following the October 7th attacks against Israel, the American Red Cross presented Magen David Adom with the International Humanitarian Service Award stating that the organization &quot;exemplifies and inspires the humanitarian values of human dignity, respect, [and] compassion.&quot;

==History==
The Magen David Adom organization was formed by nurse Dr. Meshulam Levontin in 1930 as a volunteer association with a single branch in Tel Aviv. Moshe Frenkel founded the first state wide branch of Magen David Adom. After opening branches in Jerusalem and Haifa, it was extended nationwide five years later, providing medical support to the public including not only Jews, but also Arabs (Muslim, Druze, and Christian). On 12 July 1950, the Knesset passed a law giving MDA official status as Israel&#x27;s national emergency service. The objectives of Magen David Adom include maintaining first aid services; maintaining a storage service of blood, plasma and their by-products; instruction in first aid and pre-hospital emergency medicine; operating a volunteer program in which volunteers are trained in first aid, basic and advanced life support including mobile intensive care units; transportation of patients, women in labor, and evacuation of those wounded and killed in road accidents; transportation of doctors, nurses and medical auxiliary forces. In the late 1960s the organization refocused its rapid trauma treatment and transport protocols due to the efforts of Dr. Nancy Caroline. Caroline&#x27;s work at Magen David Adom was based upon studies she conducted with Dr. Peter Safar and the Freedom House Paramedics of Pittsburgh.


==Volunteers==

Magen David Adom is mainly staffed by volunteers, and has over 26,000 people volunteering and over one million combined man-hours per year. The minimum age to join Magen David Adom&#x27;s basic first aid course and become a volunteer is 15.

Since 2001, international volunteers aged 18 and over have the option to come to Israel for a two-month MDA Overseas Program. The program was initially named after its founder and first coordinator Yochai Porat, who was killed by a sniper on 3 March 2002 while serving reserve duty as a combat medic in the Israel Defense Forces. All volunteers pass a 60-hour course that covers a wide range of topics ranging from common medical conditions and trauma situations to mass casualty events. Those who pass the course are then dispatched throughout the country and work with local volunteers in ambulances to provide initial medical care on the regular and Mobile Intensive Care Ambulances.

While the program was originally financially supported by the Jewish Agency for Israel, it has recently been taken over by the Israel Experience organization, which also offers programs for Jewish youths on Birthright Israel trips.

Visitors to Israel are also welcome to donate blood through the &quot;Sharing for Life&quot; program. Since its inception in 2001, increasing numbers of people have donated blood, usually through groups such as Christian solidarity missions, or family Bar-Bat Mitzvas, especially during seasonal traditional pilgrimage times, such as Passover and Easter.

==Current status==

Although MDA currently staffs approximately 4,000 emergency medical technicians (EMTs), paramedics and emergency physicians, it still relies heavily on over 26,000 volunteers who serve in both operational and administrative capacities. MDA headquarters and its blood bank are located at the Tel HaShomer complex in the center of the country. The organization operates 189 stations over the country, with a fleet of over 2,000 ambulances nationwide. Among them are mobile intensive care units (MICU), special ambulances equipped for mass casualty events, and armored ambulances. Most of the fleet is made up of regular size vans providing Basic Life Support. These are called &quot;Lavan&quot; (which in Hebrew means &quot;White&quot;) due to their external aspect and to differentiate them from the MICU, which have orange stripes on the sides. They are used by EMTs who generally have ranks equivalent to Basic and Intermediate EMTs in the US. In Israel, they are called &quot;ma&#x27;ar&quot; (first responders), &quot;ma&#x27;ar bachir&quot; (Certified first responder over 18, with some additional training), &quot;chovesh&quot; (EMT-B), and &quot;chovesh bachir&quot; (EMT-I). Ambulance drivers are EMTs or higher with a drivers&#x27; license for emergency vehicles. MICUs similar to the US Type II units and used by paramedics and physicians respond only to the most medically serious cases. They are called Natan (if a physician is on board) or Atan (if it is only staffed by paramedics and EMTs). Major stations include special units (called &quot;Taaran&quot;) for responding to mass casualty events such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks.

In some cases air ambulance service is provided by Israeli Air Force 669 unit with MEDEVAC helicopters. However, in 2008, MDA started to provide paramedics for three EMS MBB Bo 105s imported from Germany by Lahak Aviation Ltd. These three helicopters (out of four brought by Lahak) are operated by Lahak Aviation&#x27;s operating company, Shapirit Air Services Ltd., as Ambulance helicopters. Previous attempts by MDA to integrate independent helicopter service in the 1970s were unsuccessful because of high cost.

Unique among civilian emergency medical services due to its role as national aid society according to the Geneva Conventions, MDA can become an auxiliary arm of the Israel Defense Forces during times of war.

Decommissioned MDA ambulances have been donated to a number of kibbutzim, moshavim, factories, and communities on both sides of the Green Line. Crews manning these lifesaving vehicles are trained and certified by Magen David Adom.

MDA has a dedicated medical emergency telephone number in Israel, 101.

The average ambulance response time in Israel is 8.3 minutes (measured from the moment a dispatch request is received to arrival at the scene of an emergency). Calls to 101 are answered within 4 seconds. As of 2021, MDA handles approximately 2.7 million medical emergency phone calls to 101 per year.

==Relation to International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement==

Until 2006, Magen David Adom was denied membership in the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement since it had refused to replace its red Star of David emblem with a pre-approved symbol.

The stated reason for the denial of membership was concerns about symbol proliferation; at the same 1929 conference that granted use of the Red Crescent and Red Lion and Sun, a limitation was placed on acceptance of any further emblems. The &quot;Red Star of David&quot; symbol was not submitted to the ICRC until 1931.

Similar concerns of India, Ceylon, and the former Soviet Union regarding the use of non-Hindu and seemingly religious symbols were also dismissed by the ICRC, but their national bodies chose to adopt the Red Cross as their official emblems in order to gain entry. The Red Cross—the inverse of the Swiss flag, the country of origin of the founder of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement—is not intended as a religious symbol, but is often perceived as such.

In her March 2000 letter to the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; and the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Dr. Bernadine Healy, then president of the American Red Cross, wrote: &quot;The international committee&#x27;s feared proliferation of symbols is a pitiful fig leaf, used for decades as the reason for excluding the Magen David Adom—the Shield (or Star) of David.&quot; In protest, the American Red Cross withheld millions in administrative funding to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) since May 2000.

Since the mid-1990s, there has been extensive and growing co-operation between MDA and the ICRC including, among other things, a $2.2 million expenditure on strengthening ties between the two organizations, the signing in 2000 of a two-year co-operation statement, the permanent placement of an ICRC co-operation officer in MDA headquarters, and extensive support of the MDA&#x27;s blood bank activities. In addition, there are bilateral cooperation agreements between MDA and a number of national Red Cross societies.

On 7 December 2005, a diplomatic conference of states party to the Geneva Conventions adopted a third additional protocol, thereby introducing a new protective emblem, dubbed the &quot;Red Crystal.&quot; This third protocol emblem is hailed as a universal emblem free of religious, ethnic, or political connotation. The new symbol is a red square frame tilted at a forty-five–degree angle. According to the rules of the third additional protocol, MDA can continue to use the Red Star of David as its sole emblem for indicative purposes within Israel. For indicative use in missions abroad, MDA can, depending on the specific situation in the host country, either incorporate the Red Star of David inside the Red Crystal or use the Red Crystal alone.

On 22 June 2006, MDA was recognised by the ICRC and admitted as a full member of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies, following adoption of the Red Crystal symbol in the statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement on the same level as the Red Cross and Red Crescent symbols.

The MDA&#x27;s admission to the International Federation was conditioned on agreements signed in 2005 with the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Under these agreements, the red Magen David symbol could not be used in countries other than Israel; moreover the MDA agreed not to operate in the West Bank or in East Jerusalem.

===Service in the West Bank===
Under the 2005 agreements, the MDA agreed to operate within the international legal framework applicable to the West Bank and recognized that the Palestine Red Cross Society was the authorized national society in the Palestinian territory. The MDA had therefore to discontinue its operations in the West Bank. In December 2011, the International Conference of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement &quot;noted with regret&quot; that the 2005 agreement had not been fully implemented and decided to continue the monitoring process. A few months earlier, Dani Dayan from the Yesha Council, a settler organization, had accused the MDA of removing the red Magen David from ambulances operating in the West Bank. Dayan asserted that the MDA was doing so under pressure from the International Committee of the Red Cross. An MDA spokesman replied that the MDA continued to use the classic Red Star logo on its ambulances housed in 12 places across the West Bank. 
In October 2011 Yonatan Yagodovsky, director of MDA&#x27;s fundraising department, declared that &quot;the MDA will continue to use its emblem and logo, and no one ever asked us to take it off.&quot; In January 2012, the ICRC confirmed that MDA had in fact agreed to stop all services within the West Bank. Rescue efforts would &quot;officially&quot; be administered by regional councils instead, and would not use the red Magen David symbol. As a result, many contributors reportedly stopped donating to the MDA; some young settlers, a considerable percentage of the volunteer force, stopped volunteering for the MDA in protest.

In 2016, Palestinian groups said MDA continued to violate the stipulation that its paramedic teams would use a neutral emblem while working outside the country, and called on the ICRC to expel the group.

==Tracing service==
Magen David Adom&#x27;s tracing service was established to assist in locating relatives lost in the Holocaust. In 2000–2007, the service handled 5,000 applications.

== Donor eligibility ==
Magen David Adom provides some restrictions on who can donate blood, largely in line with CDC guidelines. For example, donors must be above 18 years old (or 17 years old with parental permission) and below 65 years old. As of January 2018, however, Magen David Adom allows men who have sex with men to donate blood. Restrictions that previously barred Ethiopian immigrants from donating blood were also dropped.

<text>George Edwin Starbuck (June 15, 1931 in Columbus, Ohio – August 15, 1996 in Tuscaloosa, Alabama) was an American poet of the neo-formalist school.

==Life==
Starbuck studied at Chadwick School, the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, Berkeley, the American Academy in Rome, the University of Chicago, and Harvard University. He also studied under Robert Lowell in the Boston University workshop with Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton. He taught at the Iowa Writers Workshop, Boston University, and the State University of New York, Buffalo. He was fired by SUNY-Buffalo for not taking a loyalty oath, but was vindicated by the Supreme Court in 1965. His students included Maxine Kumin, Peter Davison, Emily Hiestand, Mary Baine Campbell, Craig Lucas, James Hercules Sutton, and Askold Melnyczuk.

Starbuck had five children: Margaret, Stephen, John, Anthony, and Joshua. His papers are held at the University of Alabama library.

Starbuck&#x27;s work is marked by clever rhymes, witty asides, and the fusing of Romantic themes with cynicism about modern life. For example, his book &quot;Bone Thoughts&quot; was published with half its pages blank, and he called his style of formalism &quot;SLABS&quot; (Standard Length And Breadth Sonnets). He was not widely appreciated in the mainstream culture during his lifetime, but two collections of his poems published in the early 2000s, &quot;The Works: Poems Selected from Five Decades&quot; and &quot;Visible Ink&quot;, helped win him a wider audience. Julie Larios writes of Starbuck, &quot;Often wrongly pigeonholed as a light verse poet, he was a technical master and superb ironist.&quot;

Starbuck&#x27;s best-known poems include &quot;Tuolumne,&quot; &quot;On an Urban Battlefield,&quot; and &quot;Sonnet With a Different Letter At the End of Every Line.&quot;

<doc id="413668" wikidata="Q637544" url="?curid=413668" title="Battle of Amphipolis">
<text>The Battle of Amphipolis was fought in 422 BC during the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. It was the culmination of events that began in 424 BC with the capture of Amphipolis by the Spartans.

==Prelude==
In 424 BC, in response to the Athenian harassments of the Peloponnese from Pylos and Cythera after the Battle of Pylos, Spartan general Brasidas gained permission to take an army north to attack Athenian holdings in Thrace. Brasidas gathered an army of 700 helots armed as hoplites and 1,000 mercenary hoplites from the Peloponnese near Corinth. After foiling an Athenian attempt to capture Megara, Brasidas marched his army through Thessaly and linked up with Perdiccas II of Macedon, one of Sparta&#x27;s northern allies. In late August, the Brasidians arrived at and took Acanthus on the Chalcidice. Early December 424, Brasidas set out for his main objective: Amphipolis.

==Capture of Amphipolis, 424–423 BC==
In the winter of 424–423, around the same time as the Battle of Delium, Brasidas besieged Amphipolis, an Athenian colony in Thrace on the Strymon river. The city was defended by the Athenian general Eucles, who sent for help from Thucydides (at that point a general, later a famous historian), who was at Thasos with seven Athenian ships.

In order to capture the city before Thucydides arrived, Brasidas offered to let everyone who wished to stay keep their property, and offered safe passage to those who wanted to leave. Amphipolis surrendered, despite protests from Eucles. Thucydides arrived at the nearby port of Eion on the same day the city surrendered, and defended it with help from those who had left Amphipolis. Meanwhile, Brasidas began to ally with more Thracian towns and attack other towns in the area, such as Torone. The Athenians were afraid that their other allies would quickly capitulate, as the Amphipolitans had, if Brasidas offered them favourable terms of peace.

Thucydides, who recounted the capture of Amphipolis in his &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot;, is often considered to be partially or entirely responsible for the fall of Amphipolis. Some have seen his actions as &quot;gross negligence,&quot; although he claimed he was unable to arrive in time to save the city. He was recalled to Athens, where he was tried and exiled.

==Armistice of 423 BC==
In response to the fall of the city, Athens and Sparta signed an armistice. Athens hoped they could fortify more towns in preparation for future attacks from Brasidas, and the Spartans hoped Athens would finally return the prisoners taken at the Battle of Sphacteria earlier in 425 BC. According to the terms of the truce, &quot;It is proposed that each side should remain in its own territory, holding what it now holds...The armistice is to last for one year.&quot; While the negotiations were going on, Brasidas captured Scione and refused to give it back when news of the treaty arrived. The Athenian leader Cleon sent a force to take it back, despite the treaty.

==Second Battle of Amphipolis, 422 BC==
When the armistice ended in 422, Cleon arrived in Thrace with a force of 30 ships, 1,200 hoplites, and 300 cavalry, along with many other troops from Athens&#x27; allies. He recaptured Torone and Scione; at Torone, the Spartan commander Pasitelidas was taken captive back to Athens. Cleon then took up position at Eion, while Brasidas took his position at Cerdylion, a nearby elevated settlement on the other side of the Strymon (also Latinized as &quot;Cerdylium&quot;). Brasidas had about 2,000 hoplites and 300 cavalry, plus some other troops in Amphipolis, but he did not feel that he could defeat Cleon in a pitched battle. Brasidas then moved his forces back into Amphipolis and prepared to attack; when Cleon realized an attack was coming, and being reluctant to fight before expected reinforcements arrived, he began to retreat; the retreat was badly arranged and Brasidas attacked boldly against a disorganised enemy, achieving victory.

In an excerpt of Brasidas&#x27; brief pre-battle speech, he specially addressed the allied Lacedaemonian forces, whom he assigned under Clearidas leadership, while for himself he handpicked a hundred and fifty hoplites; he said: &quot;..bear in mind that the three virtues of a good soldier are zeal in battle, sense of honor and obedience to the leaders..and I will reveal that I will conduct myself in action following the advice I give to my comrades.&quot;

In the rout that followed, Brasidas was mortally injured, although the Athenians did not realize it. Cleon was also killed when he was attacked by troops under the Spartan commander Clearidas. The entire Athenian army fled back to Eion, although about 600 of them were killed before they reached the port. Only seven soldiers were killed on the Spartan side.

==Results==
Brasidas lived long enough to learn of his victory, and was honorably buried in the agora area of Amphipolis. The Amphipolitans began to regard him as a hero, instituting games and yearly offerings in his honour. They also made him the city&#x27;s founder and dedicated it to him, pulling down the buildings which Hagnon the Athenian had erected and destroying any memorials which might have remained to future time of his foundation. After the battle, neither the Athenians nor the Spartans wanted to continue the war (Cleon being the most hawkish member from Athens), and the Peace of Nicias was signed in 421 BC. This treaty was also eventually broken. Thucydides was exiled for his failure to protect Amphipolis, thus ending the period of the war in which he directly participated.

Ch. Koukouli-Chrysanthaki in her three decade research at Amphipolis offers evidence of the recovery and identification of Brasidas&#x27; burial at the ancient Amphipolis&#x27; agora. An archaeological dig at Amphipolis unearthed the foundations of a small building, and a cist grave containing the remains of a silver ossuary accompanied by a gold wreath, believed to hold the remains of Brasidas. This ossuary is currently located in the Archaeological Museum of Amphipolis. The grave itself was a hole dug into the existing rock, with limestone blocks and mortar used to create the cist grave.

In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Apology&quot;, the philosopher Socrates claims to be a veteran of this battle.

<text>Abd al-Qadir ibn Muhyi al-Din (6 September 1808 – 26 May 1883; &#x27;), known as theEmir AbdelkaderorAbd al-Qadir al-Hassani al-Jaza&#x27;iri, was an Algerian religious and military leader who led a struggle against the French colonial invasion of Algiers in the early 19th century. As an Islamic scholar and Sufi who unexpectedly found himself leading a military campaign, he built up a collection of Algerian tribesmen that for many years successfully held out against one of the most advanced armies in Europe. His consistent regard for what would now be called human rights, especially as regards his Christian opponents, drew widespread admiration, and a crucial intervention to save the Christian community of Damascus from a massacre in 1860 brought honours and awards from around the world. Within Algeria, he was able to unite many Arab and Berber tribes to resist the spread of French colonization. His efforts to unite the country against French invaders led some French authors to describe him as a &quot;modern Jugurtha&quot;, and his ability to combine religious and political authority has led to his being acclaimed as the &quot;Saint among the Princes, the Prince among the Saints&quot;.

== Name ==

The name &quot;Abdelkader&quot; is sometimes transliterated as &quot;ʻAbd al-Qādir&quot;, &quot;Abd al-Kader&quot;, &quot;Abdul Kader&quot; or other variants, and he is often referred to as simply the Emir Abdelkader (since &quot;El Jezairi&quot; just means &quot;the Algerian&quot;). &quot;Ibn Muhieddine&quot; is a patronymic meaning &quot;son of Muhieddine&quot;.

==Early years==
Abdelkader was born in el Guetna, a town and commune in Mascara on 6 September 1808, to a religious family. His father, Muhieddine (or &quot;Muhyi al-Din&quot;) al-Hasani, was a muqaddam in a religious institution affiliated with the Qadiriyya tariqa and claimed descendence from Muhammad, through the Idrisid dynasty. Abdelkader was thus a &quot;sharif&quot;, and entitled to add the honorary patronymic &quot;al-Hasani&quot; (&quot;descendant of Hasan ibn Ali&quot;) to his name.

He grew up in his father&#x27;s zawiya, which by the early nineteenth century had become the centre of a thriving community on the banks of the Oued al-Hammam. Like other students, he received a traditional and common education in theology, jurisprudence and grammar; it was said that he could read and write by the age of five. A gifted student, Abdelkader succeeded in reciting the Qur&#x27;an by heart at the age of 14, thereby receiving the title of &quot;ḥāfiẓ&quot;; a year later, he went to Oran for further education. He was a good orator and could excite his peers with poetry and religious diatribes. He is noted for numerous published essays about adapting Islamic law to modern society.

As a young man in 1825, he set out on the Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, with his father. While there, he encountered Imam Shamil; the two spoke at length on different topics. He also traveled to Damascus and Baghdad, and visited the graves of noted Muslims, such as ibn Arabi and Abdul Qadir Gilani, who was also called &quot;al-Jilālī&quot; in Algeria. This experience cemented his religious enthusiasm. On his way back to Algeria, he was impressed by the reforms carried out by Muhammad Ali of Egypt. He returned to his homeland a few months before the arrival of the French under the July Monarchy.

== French invasion and resistance ==
===Early success (1830–1837)===
In 1830, Algeria was invaded by France; French colonial domination over Algeria eventually supplanted domination by the Ottoman Empire and the Kouloughlis. Western Algeria had already been the hotbed of numerous anti-Ottoman revolts, leading to little in the way of coordinated resistance to the French.

When the French Africa Army reached Oran in January 1831, Abdelkader&#x27;s father was asked to lead a resistance campaign against them; Muhieddine called for jihad and he and his son were among those involved in early attacks below the walls of the city, however these did not involve a broad coalition of tribes.

It was at this point that Abdelkader came to the fore. At a meeting of the western tribes in the autumn of 1832, he was elected him Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin (typically abbreviated to &quot;Emir&quot;). Following his father&#x27;s refusal of the position on the grounds that he was too old.

Abdelkader was seen as an appropriate candidate not only because of his age but also because of his own learning, devoutness and saintly bloodline. The appointment was confirmed five days later at the Great Mosque of Mascara where a proclamation was read calling in deeply religious terms on tribal leaders to join him.

But within a year, through a combination of punitive raids and careful politics, Abdelkader had succeeded in uniting the tribes in the region and in establishing security – his area of influence now covered the entire Province of Oran. The local French commander-in-chief, General Louis Alexis Desmichels, saw Abdelkader as the principal representative of the area during peace negotiations, and in 1834 they signed the Desmichels Treaty, which ceded near-total control of Oran Province to Abdelkader. For the French, this was a way of establishing peace in the region while also confining Abdelkader to the west; but his status as a co-signatory also did much to elevate him in the eyes of the Berbers and of the French.

Using this treaty as a start, he imposed his rule on the tribes of the Chelif, Miliana, and Médéa. The French high command, unhappy with what they now saw as the unfavorable terms of the Desmichels Treaty, recalled General Desmichels and replaced him with General Camille Alphonse Trézel, which caused a resumption of hostilities. Abdelkader&#x27;s tribal warriors met the French forces in July 1834 at the Battle of Macta, where the French suffered an unexpected defeat.

France&#x27;s response was to step up its military campaign, and under new commanders the French won several important encounters including the 1836 Battle of Sikkak. But political opinion in France was becoming ambivalent towards Algeria, with a political desire to end the conflict General Thomas Robert Bugeaud was &quot;authorized to use all means to induce Abd el-Kader to make overtures of peace&quot;. The result, after protracted negotiations, was the Treaty of Tafna, signed on 30 May 1837. This treaty gave even more control of interior portions of Algeria to Abdelkader. Abdelkader thus won control of all of Oran Province and extended his reach to the neighbouring province of Titteri and beyond.

===New state===
The period of peace following the Treaty of Tafna benefited both sides, and the Emir Abdelkader took the opportunity to consolidate a new functional state, with a capital in Tagdemt. He played down his political power, however, repeatedly declining the title of sultan and striving to concentrate on his spiritual authority, through obtaining a &quot;fatwa&quot; which gave him firm authority to call for Jihad and made tax avoidance a &quot;crime against the Muslim community as a whole&quot;. The state he created was broadly theocratic, and most positions of authority were held by members of the religious aristocracy; even the main unit of currency was named the &quot;muhammadiyya&quot;, after the Prophet.

His first military action was to move south into the Sahara and al-Tijani, where Sidi Muhammad al-Tijani, refused to recognise Abd al-Qadir&#x27;s rule. Abdelkader attempted to enter the town of Aïn Madhi but was beaten back and instead he laid siege until when December 1839 Sidi Muhammad al-Tijani accepted exile.

Next, he moved east to the valley of the Chelif and Titteri, but was resisted by the Bey of Constantine Province, Hajj Ahmed. In other actions, he demanded punishment of the Kouloughlis of Zouatna for supporting the French. By the end of 1838, his rule extended east to Kabylie, and south to Biskra, and to the Moroccan border. He continued to fight al-Tijani and besieged his capital at Aïn Madhi for six months, eventually destroying it.


Another aspect of Abdelkader that helped him lead his fledgling nation was his ability to find and use good talent regardless of its nationality. He would employ Jews and Christians on his way to building his nation. One of these was Léon Roches. His approach to the military was to have a standing army of 2000 men supported by volunteers from the local tribes. He placed, in the interior towns, arsenals, warehouses, and workshops, where he stored items to be sold for arms purchases from England. Through his frugal living (he lived in a tent), he taught his people the need for austerity and through education he taught them concepts such as nationality and independence.

===End of the nation===

The peace ended when the Duc d&#x27;Orléans, ignoring the terms of the Treaty of Tafna, headed an expeditionary force that breached the Iron Gates. On 15 October 1839, Abd al-Qadir attacked the French as they were colonizing the Plains of Mitidja and routed the invaders. In response the French officially declared war on 18 November 1839. The fighting bogged down until General Thomas Robert Bugeaud returned to Algeria, this time as governor-general, in February 1841. Abdelkader was originally encouraged to hear that Bugeaud, the promoter of the Treaty of Tafna, was returning; but this time Bugeaud&#x27;s strategy would be radically different. This time, his approach was one of annihilation, with the conquest of Algeria as the endgame:

Abdelkader was effective at using guerrilla warfare and for a decade, up until 1842, scored many victories. He often signed tactical truces with the French, but these did not last. His power base was in the western part of Algeria, where he was successful in uniting the tribes against the French. He was noted for his chivalry; on one occasion he released his French captives simply because he had insufficient food to feed them. Throughout this period, Abdelkader demonstrated political and military leadership and acted as a capable administrator and a persuasive orator. His fervent faith in the doctrines of Islam was unquestioned.

Until the beginning of 1842 the struggle went in his favor; however, the resistance was put down by Marshal Bugeaud, due to Bugeaud&#x27;s adaptation to the guerilla tactics employed by Abdelkader. Abdelkader would strike fast and disappear into the terrain with light infantry; however the French increased their mobility. The French armies brutally suppressed the native population and practiced a scorched earth policy in the countryside to force the residents to starve so as to desert their leader. By 1841, his fortifications had all but been destroyed and he was forced to wander the interior of the Oran. In 1842, he had lost control of Tlemcen and his lines of communications with Morocco were not effective. He was able to cross the border into Morocco for a respite, but the French defeated the Moroccans at the Battle of Isly. He left Morocco, and was able to keep up the fight to the French by taking the Sidi Brahim at the Battle of Sidi-Brahim.

===Surrender===
Abdelkader was ultimately forced to surrender. His failure to get support from eastern tribes, apart from the Kabyles of western Kabylie, had contributed to the quelling of the rebellion, and a decree from Abd al-Rahman of Morocco following the 1844 Treaty of Tangiers had outlawed the Emir from his entire kingdom.

Abd al-Rahman of Morocco secretly sent soldiers to attack Abdelkader and destroy his supplies, six months after the emir routed the Moroccans and imprisoned them. Following this failure by the Moroccans, an assassin was sent to kill Emir Abdelkader. While he was reading he raised his head and witnessed a large powerful assassin armed with a dagger, however the assassin quickly threw the dagger to the ground and said: &quot;I was going to strike you, but the sight of you disarmed me. I thought I saw the halo of the Prophet on your head.&quot; The nephew of Abd al-Rahman, Mawlay Hashim was sent along with the governor of the Rif, El Hamra in command of a Moroccan army to attack the Emir, however the Moroccans were severely defeated in battle, El Hamra was killed, Mawlay Hashim had barely escaped with his life and Abd al-Rahman accepted this defeat. The Moroccans led another offensive in the Battle of Agueddin in which they were defeated by Abdelkader in all three military engagements, however Abdelkader soon made the choice to withdraw from Morocco and enter French territory for negotiations.

On 23 December 1847, Abdelkader surrendered to General Louis Juchault de Lamoricière in exchange for the promise that he would be allowed to go to Alexandria or Acre. He supposedly commented on his own surrender with the words, &quot;And God undoes what my hand has done&quot;, although this is probably apocryphal. His request was granted, and two days later his surrender was made official to the French Governor-General of Algeria, Henri d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Aumale, to whom Abdelkader symbolically handed his war-horse. Ultimately, however, the French government refused to honour Lamoricière&#x27;s promise: Abdelkader was shipped to France and, instead of being allowed to carry on to the East, ended up being kept in captivity.

== Imprisonment and exile ==

Abdelkader and his family and followers were detained in France, first at Fort Lamalgue in Toulon, then at Pau, and in November 1848 they were transferred to the château of Amboise. Damp conditions in the castle led to deteriorating health as well as morale in the Emir and his followers, and his fate became something of a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; in certain circles. Several high-profile figures, including Émile de Girardin and Victor Hugo, called for greater clarification over the Emir&#x27;s situation; future prime minister Émile Ollivier carried out a public opinion campaign to raise awareness over his fate. There was also international pressure. Lord Londonderry visited Abdelkader in Amboise and subsequently wrote to then-President Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (whom he had known during the latter&#x27;s exile in England) to appeal for the Emir&#x27;s release.

Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte (later the Emperor Napoleon III) was a relatively new president, having come to power in the Revolution of 1848 while Abdelkader was already imprisoned. He was keen to make a break with several policies of the previous regime, and Abdelkader&#x27;s cause was one of them. Eventually, on 16 October 1852, Abdelkader was released by the President and given an annual pension of 100,000 francs on taking an oath never again to disturb Algeria. He then took up residence in Bursa, today&#x27;s Turkey, moving in 1855 to Amara District in Damascus. He devoted himself anew to theology and philosophy, and composed a philosophical treatise, of which a French translation was published in 1858 under the title of &quot;Rappel à l&#x27;intelligent, avis à l&#x27;indifférent&quot; (&quot;Reminder to the intelligent, notice to the indifferent&quot;), and again in 1877 under the title of &quot;Lettre aux Français&quot; (&quot;Letter to the French&quot;). He also wrote a book on the Arabian horse.

During his stay in Syria, &#x27;Abd al-Qadir became an active Freemason and was close to the French intellectual circles. He was a prominent member of the lodge of the &#x27;Pyramides&#x27;, which was directly under the patronage of the Grand Orient of France. While in Damascus, he also befriended Jane Digby as well as Richard and Isabel Burton. Abdelkader&#x27;s knowledge of Sufism and skill with languages earned Burton&#x27;s respect and friendship; his wife Isabel described him as follows:

== Massacre of Christians in 1860 in Damascus ==

In July 1860, conflict between the Druze and Maronites of Mount Lebanon spread to Damascus, and local Druze attacked the Christian quarter, killing over 12,000 people. Abdelkader had previously warned the French consul as well as the Council of Damascus that violence was imminent; when it finally broke out, he sheltered large numbers of Christians, including the heads of several foreign consulates as well as religious groups such as the Sisters of Mercy, in the safety of his house. His eldest sons were sent into the streets to offer any Christians under threat shelter under his protection, and Abdelkader himself was said by many survivors to have played an instrumental part in saving them.
Reports coming out of Syria as the rioting subsided stressed the prominent role of Abdelkader, and considerable international recognition followed. The French government increased his pension to 150,000 francs and bestowed on him the Grand Cross of the Légion d&#x27;honneur; he also received the Grand Cross of the Redeemer from Greece, a Star of Magnificence from the Masonic Order of France, the Order of the Medjidie, First Class from Turkey, and the Order of Pope Pius IX from the Vatican. Abraham Lincoln sent him a pair of inlaid pistols (now on display in the Algiers museum) and Great Britain a gold-inlaid shotgun. In France, the episode represented the culmination of a remarkable turnaround, from being considered as an enemy of France during the first half of the 19th century, to becoming a &quot;friend of France&quot; after having intervened in favor of persecuted Christians.

In 1865 he visited Paris on the invitation of Napoleon III and was greeted with both official and popular respect. In 1871, during an insurrection in Algeria, he disowned one of his sons, who was arousing the tribes around Constantine.

==Death and burial==
Abdelkader died in Damascus on 26 May 1883 and was buried near the great Sufi ibn Arabi in Damascus.

His body was recovered in 1965 and is now in the El Alia Cemetery in Algiers. This transfer of his remains was controversial as Abd el-Kader had clearly wanted to be buried in Damascus with his master, ibn Arabi.

== Image and legacy ==


From the beginning of his career, Abdelkader inspired admiration not only from within Algeria, but from Europeans as well, even while fighting against the French forces. &quot;The generous concern, the tender sympathy&quot; he showed to his prisoners-of-war was &quot;almost without parallel in the annals of war&quot;, and he was careful to show respect for the private religion of any captives.

In 1843 Jean-de-Dieu Soult declared that Abd-el-Kader was one of the three great men then living; the two others, Shamil, 3rd Imam of Dagestan and Muhammad Ali of Egypt also being Muslims.

ʿAbd al-Qādir was involved in research that went into the Bulaq Press&#x27;s 1911 third edition of Ibn Arabi&#x27;s &quot;Meccan Revelations&quot;. This edition was based on the Konya Manuscript, Ibn Arabi&#x27;s revised version of the text, and it subsequently became standard.

The town of Elkader, Iowa in the United States is named after Abdelkader. The town&#x27;s founders, Timothy Davis, John Thompson, and Chester Sage, were impressed by his fight against French colonial power and decided to pick his name as the name for their new settlement in 1846.

In 2013, the American film director Oliver Stone announced the pending production of a filmed biopic called &quot;The Emir Abd el-Kader&quot;, to be directed by Charles Burnett. To date the film has not been made.

The Abd el-Kader Fellowship is a postdoctoral fellowship of The Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture at the University of Virginia.

On 6 February 2022, a French sculpture of Abdelkader was reported vandalized on 5 February in Amboise, central France. The vandalism occurred amid the presidential election campaign, during which immigration and Islam have been significant issues for specific candidates.

His great grandson Khaldoun Al-Hasani Al-Jazaeri was among those found to have been tortured and killed in Sednaya Prison in 2015. He was an Islamic scholar and one of the few people to have memorised all 10 readings of the Quran. He was a specialist in Maliki law and was a fully qualified Dentist.

<text>Memory Alpha is a wiki encyclopedia for topics related to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; fictional universe. Created by Harry Doddema and Dan Carlson, it uses the wiki model and is hosted by Fandom on the MediaWiki software. , Memory Alpha contains over 56,000 articles and 62,000 images in its English edition. The site is also available in several other languages.

==History==
In 1995, Dan Carlson created a personal &quot;Star Trek&quot; starship database called Starfleet Ship Registry. By 2000, he had expanded the database&#x27;s scope and renamed it Starfleet Reference Database, including it as one of the five basic sections of his newly-launched website &quot;The Gigantic Collection of Star Trek Minutiae&quot;.

In the fall of 2003, Harry Doddema proposed the creation of a &quot;Star Trek&quot; wiki in a post on the Flare Sci-Fi Forums. Carlson was interested in the concept and the two of them went to work. Using Starfleet Reference Database as a framework, they named the project Memory Alpha, after the Federation&#x27;s central library from the &quot;TOS&quot; episode &quot;The Lights of Zetar&quot;. Memory Alpha officially launched on December 5, 2003, as a section of the &quot;Star Trek Minutiae&quot; website.

In April 2004, Memory Alpha was launched as its own website. In February 2005, Memory Alpha joined Wikicities (now known as Fandom). By September, it was the largest project on Wikicities and a central hub for Trekkies. That month, Memory Alpha received the &quot;Ex Astris Excellentia&quot; award from Ex Astris Scientia, a &quot;Star Trek&quot; reference site. The site was featured as the Sci-Fi Channel&#x27;s Site of the Week for the week of October 10.

Blogger Will Richardson called the site &quot;one of the most impressive [wikis] out there.&quot; By October 5, 2006, Memory Alpha had reached the 20,000 article mark. On June 20, 2007, Memory Alpha reached 25,000 articles.

In 2007, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named Memory Alpha one of the 25 Essential Fansites. Simon Pegg, actor and writer for &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot;, used Memory Alpha as a resource in the writing process of the film, even asking the community&#x27;s founders to name and establish etymology for &quot;vokaya&quot;, a Vulcan mineral that enables Spock to locate Nyota Uhura. &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;″s showrunners have described Memory Alpha as &quot;an amazing resource.&quot;

<doc id="413679" wikidata="Q763244" url="?curid=413679" title="Blood bank">
<text>A blood bank is a center where blood gathered as a result of blood donation is stored and preserved for later use in blood transfusion. The term &quot;blood bank&quot; typically refers to a department of a hospital usually within a clinical pathology laboratory where the storage of blood product occurs and where pre-transfusion and blood compatibility testing is performed. However, it sometimes refers to a collection center, and some hospitals also perform collection. Blood banking includes tasks related to blood collection, processing, testing, separation, and storage.

For blood donation agencies in various countries, see list of blood donation agencies and list of blood donation agencies in the United States.

==Types of blood transfused==
Several types of blood transfusion exist:
* Whole blood, which is blood transfused without separation.
* Red blood cells or packed cells is transfused to patients with anemia/iron deficiency. It also helps to improve the oxygen saturation in blood. It can be stored at 2.0 °C-6.0 °C for 35–45 days.
* Platelet transfusion is transfused to those with low platelet count. Platelets can be stored at room temperature for up to 5–7 days. Single donor platelets, which have a more platelet count but it is bit expensive than regular.
* Plasma transfusion is indicated to patients with liver failure, severe infections or serious burns. Fresh frozen plasma can be stored at a very low temperature of -30 °C for up to 12 months. The separation of plasma from a donor&#x27;s blood is called plasmapheresis.

==History==
While the first blood transfusions were made directly from donor to receiver before coagulation, it was discovered that by adding anticoagulant and refrigerating the blood it was possible to store it for some days, thus opening the way for the development of blood banks. John Braxton Hicks was the first to experiment with chemical methods to prevent the coagulation of blood at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London, in the late 19th century. His attempts, using phosphate of soda, however, were unsuccessful.

The first non-direct transfusion was performed on March 27, 1914, by the Belgian doctor Albert Hustin, though this was a diluted solution of blood. The Argentine doctor Luis Agote used a much less diluted solution in November of the same year. Both used sodium citrate as an anticoagulant.

===First World War===
The First World War acted as a catalyst for the rapid development of blood banks and transfusion techniques. Inspired by the need to give blood to wounded soldiers in the absence of a donor, Francis Peyton Rous at the Rockefeller University (then The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research) wanted to solve the problems of blood transfusion. With a colleague, Joseph R. Turner, he made two critical discoveries: blood typing was necessary to avoid blood clumping (coagulation) and blood samples could be preserved using chemical treatment. Their report in March 1915 to identify possible blood preservative was of a failure. The experiments with gelatine, agar, blood serum extracts, starch and beef albumin proved useless. 

In June 1915, they made the first important report in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; that agglutination could be avoided if the blood samples of the donor and recipient were tested before. They developed a rapid and simple method for testing blood compatibility in which coagulation and the suitability of the blood for transfusion could be easily determined. They used sodium citrate to dilute the blood samples, and after mixing the recipient&#x27;s and donor&#x27;s blood in 9:1 and 1:1 parts, blood would either clump or remain watery after 15 minutes. Their result with a medical advice was clear:[If] clumping is present in the 9:1 mixture and to a less degree or not at all in the 1:1 mixture, it is certain that the blood of the patient agglutinates that of the donor and may perhaps hemolyze it. Transfusion in such cases is dangerous. Clumping in the 1:1 mixture with little or none in the 9:1 indicates that the plasma of the prospective donor agglutinates the cells of the prospective recipient. The risk from transfusing is much less under such circumstances, but it may be doubted whether the blood is as useful as one which does not and is not agglutinated. A blood of the latter kind should always be chosen if possible.Rous was well aware that Austrian physician Karl Landsteiner had discovered blood types a decade earlier, but the practical usage was not yet developed, as he described: &quot;The fate of Landsteiner&#x27;s effort to call attention to the practical bearing of the group differences in human bloods provides an exquisite instance of knowledge marking time on technique. Transfusion was still not done because (until at least 1915), the risk of clotting was too great.&quot; In February 1916, they reported in the &quot;Journal of Experimental Medicine&quot; the key method for blood preservation. They replaced the additive, gelatine, with a mixture sodium citrate and glucose (dextrose) solution and found: &quot;in a mixture of 3 parts of human blood, 2 parts of isotonic citrate solution (3.8 per cent sodium citrate in water), and 5 parts of isotonic dextrose solution (5.4 per cent dextrose in water), the cells remain intact for about 4 weeks.&quot; A separate report indicates the use of citrate-saccharose (sucrose) could maintain blood cells for two weeks. They noticed that the preserved bloods were just like fresh bloods and that they &quot;function excellently when reintroduced into the body.&quot; The use of sodium citrate with sugar, sometimes known as Rous-Turner solution, was the main discovery that paved the way for the development of various blood preservation methods and blood bank. 

Canadian Lieutenant Lawrence Bruce Robertson was instrumental in persuading the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) to adopt the use of blood transfusion at the Casualty Clearing Stations for the wounded. In October 1915, Robertson performed his first wartime transfusion with a syringe to a patient who had multiple shrapnel wounds. He followed this up with four subsequent transfusions in the following months, and his success was reported to Sir Walter Morley Fletcher, director of the Medical Research Committee.

Robertson published his findings in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; in 1916, and—with the help of a few like minded individuals (including the eminent physician Edward William Archibald)—was able to persuade the British authorities of the merits of blood transfusion. Robertson went on to establish the first blood transfusion apparatus at a Casualty Clearing Station on the Western Front in the spring of 1917.

Oswald Hope Robertson, a medical researcher and officer, worked with Rous at the Rockefeller between 1915 and 1917, and learned the blood matching and preservation methods. He was attached to the RAMC in 1917, where he was instrumental in establishing the first blood banks, with soldiers as donors, in preparation for the anticipated Third Battle of Ypres. He used sodium citrate as the anticoagulant, and the blood was extracted from punctures in the vein, and was stored in bottles at British and American Casualty Clearing Stations along the Front. He also experimented with preserving separated red blood cells in iced bottles. Geoffrey Keynes, a British surgeon, developed a portable machine that could store blood to enable transfusions to be carried out more easily.

===Expansion===
The world&#x27;s first blood donor service was established in 1921 by the secretary of the British Red Cross, Percy Lane Oliver. Volunteers were subjected to a series of physical tests to establish their blood group. The London Blood Transfusion Service was free of charge and expanded rapidly. By 1925, it was providing services for almost 500 patients and it was incorporated into the structure of the British Red Cross in 1926. Similar systems were established in other cities including Sheffield, Manchester and Norwich, and the service&#x27;s work began to attract international attention. Similar services were established in France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Australia and Japan.

Vladimir Shamov and Sergei Yudin in the Soviet Union pioneered the transfusion of cadaveric blood from recently deceased donors. Yudin performed such a transfusion successfully for the first time on March 23, 1930, and reported his first seven clinical transfusions with cadaveric blood at the Fourth Congress of Ukrainian Surgeons at Kharkiv in September. Also in 1930, Yudin organized the world&#x27;s first blood bank at the Nikolay Sklifosovsky Institute, which set an example for the establishment of further blood banks in different regions of the Soviet Union and in other countries. By the mid-1930s the Soviet Union had set up a system of at least 65 large blood centers and more than 500 subsidiary ones, all storing &quot;canned&quot; blood and shipping it to all corners of the country.

One of the earliest blood banks was established by Frederic Durán-Jordà during the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Duran joined the Transfusion Service at the Barcelona Hospital at the start of the conflict, but the hospital was soon overwhelmed by the demand for blood and the paucity of available donors. With support from the Department of Health of the Spanish Republican Army, Duran established a blood bank for the use of wounded soldiers and civilians. The 300–400 ml of extracted blood was mixed with 10% citrate solution in a modified Duran Erlenmeyer flask. The blood was stored in a sterile glass enclosed under pressure at 2 °C. During 30 months of work, the Transfusion Service of Barcelona registered almost 30,000 donors, and processed 9,000 liters of blood.

In 1937 Bernard Fantus, director of therapeutics at the Cook County Hospital in Chicago, established one of the first hospital blood banks in the United States. In creating a hospital laboratory that preserved, refrigerated and stored donor blood, Fantus originated the term &quot;blood bank&quot;. Within a few years, hospital and community blood banks were established across the United States.

Frederic Durán-Jordà fled to Britain in 1938, and worked with Janet Vaughan at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith Hospital to create a system of national blood banks in London. With the outbreak of war looking imminent in 1938, the War Office created the Army Blood Supply Depot (ABSD) in Bristol headed by Lionel Whitby and in control of four large blood depots around the country. British policy through the war was to supply military personnel with blood from centralized depots, in contrast to the approach taken by the Americans and Germans where troops at the front were bled to provide required blood. The British method proved to be more successful at adequately meeting all requirements and over 700,000 donors were bled over the course of the war. This system evolved into the National Blood Transfusion Service established in 1946, the first national service to be implemented.

===Medical advances===
A blood collection program was initiated in the US in 1940 and Edwin Cohn pioneered the process of blood fractionation. He worked out the techniques for isolating the serum albumin fraction of blood plasma, which is essential for maintaining the osmotic pressure in the blood vessels, preventing their collapse.

The use of blood plasma as a substitute for whole blood and for transfusion purposes was proposed as early as 1918, in the correspondence columns of the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, by Gordon R. Ward. At the onset of World War II, liquid plasma was used in Britain. A large project, known as &#x27;Blood for Britain&#x27; began in August 1940 to collect blood in New York City hospitals for the export of plasma to Britain. A dried plasma package was developed, which reduced breakage and made the transportation, packaging, and storage much simpler.

The resulting dried plasma package came in two tin cans containing 400 cc bottles. One bottle contained enough distilled water to reconstitute the dried plasma contained within the other bottle. In about three minutes, the plasma would be ready to use and could stay fresh for around four hours. Charles R. Drew was appointed medical supervisor, and he was able to transform the test tube methods into the first successful mass production technique.

Another important breakthrough came in 1939–40 when Karl Landsteiner, Alex Wiener, Philip Levine, and R.E. Stetson discovered the Rh blood group system, which was found to be the cause of the majority of transfusion reactions up to that time. Three years later, the introduction by J.F. Loutit and Patrick L. Mollison of acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) solution, which reduced the volume of anticoagulant, permitted transfusions of greater volumes of blood and allowed longer-term storage.

Carl Walter and W.P. Murphy Jr. introduced the plastic bag for blood collection in 1950. Replacing breakable glass bottles with durable plastic bags allowed for the evolution of a collection system capable of safe and easy preparation of multiple blood components from a single unit of whole blood.

Further extending the shelf life of stored blood up to 42 days was an anticoagulant preservative, CPDA-1, introduced in 1979, which increased the blood supply and facilitated resource-sharing among blood banks.

==Collection and processing==
In the U.S., certain standards are set for the collection and processing of each blood product. &quot;Whole blood&quot; (WB) is the proper name for one defined product, specifically unseparated venous blood with an approved preservative added. Most blood for transfusion is collected as whole blood. Autologous donations are sometimes transfused without further modification, however whole blood is typically separated (via centrifugation) into its components, with red blood cells (RBC) in solution being the most commonly used product. Units of WB and RBC are both kept refrigerated at , with maximum permitted storage periods (shelf lives) of 35 and 42 days respectively. RBC units can also be frozen when buffered with glycerol, but this is an expensive and time-consuming process, and is rarely done. Frozen red cells are given an expiration date of up to ten years and are stored at .

The less-dense blood plasma is made into a variety of frozen components, and is labeled differently based on when it was frozen and what the intended use of the product is. If the plasma is frozen promptly and is intended for transfusion, it is typically labeled as fresh frozen plasma. If it is intended to be made into other products, it is typically labeled as recovered plasma or plasma for fractionation. Cryoprecipitate can be made from other plasma components. These components must be stored at or colder, but are typically stored at . The layer between the red cells and the plasma is referred to as the buffy coat and is sometimes removed to make platelets for transfusion. Platelets are typically pooled before transfusion and have a shelf life of 5 to 7 days, or 3 days once the facility that collected them has completed their tests. Platelets are stored at room temperature () and must be rocked/agitated. Since they are stored at room temperature in nutritive solutions, they are at relatively high risk for growing bacteria.
Some blood banks also collect products by apheresis. The most common component collected is plasma via plasmapheresis, but red blood cells and platelets can be collected by similar methods. These products generally have the same shelf life and storage conditions as their conventionally-produced counterparts.

Donors are sometimes paid; in the U.S. and Europe, most blood &quot;for transfusion&quot; is collected from volunteers while plasma for other purposes may be from paid donors.

Most collection facilities as well as hospital blood banks also perform testing to determine the blood type of patients and to identify compatible blood products, along with a battery of tests (e.g. disease) and treatments (e.g. leukocyte filtration) to ensure or enhance quality. The increasingly recognized problem of inadequate efficacy of transfusion is also raising the profile of RBC viability and quality. Notably, U.S. hospitals spend more on dealing with the consequences of transfusion-related complications than on the combined costs of buying, testing/treating, and transfusing their blood.

==Storage and management==

Routine blood storage is 42 days or 6 weeks for stored packed &quot;red blood cells&quot; (also called &quot;StRBC&quot; or &quot;pRBC&quot;), by far the most commonly transfused blood product, and involves refrigeration but usually not freezing. There has been increasing controversy about whether a given product unit&#x27;s age is a factor in transfusion efficacy, specifically on whether &quot;older&quot; blood directly or indirectly increases risks of complications. Studies have not been consistent on answering this question, with some showing that older blood is indeed less effective but with others showing no such difference; nevertheless, as storage time remains the only available way to estimate quality status or loss, a &quot;first-in-first-out&quot; inventory management approach is standard presently. It is also important to consider that there is large &quot;variability&quot; in storage results for different donors, which combined with limited available quality testing, poses challenges to clinicians and regulators seeking reliable indicators of quality for blood products and storage systems.

Transfusions of &quot;platelets&quot; are comparatively far less numerous, but they present unique storage/management issues. Platelets may only be stored for 7 days, due largely to their greater potential for contamination, which is in turn due largely to a higher storage temperature.

===RBC storage lesion===
Insufficient transfusion efficacy can result from red blood cell (RBC) blood product units damaged by so-called &quot;storage lesion&quot;—a set of biochemical and biomechanical changes which occur during storage. With red cells, this can decrease viability and ability for tissue oxygenation. Although some of the biochemical changes are reversible after the blood is transfused, the biomechanical changes are less so, and rejuvenation products are not yet able to adequately reverse this phenomenon.

Current regulatory measures are in place to minimize RBC storage lesion—including a maximum shelf life (currently 42 days), a maximum auto-hemolysis threshold (currently 1% in the US), and a minimum level of post-transfusion RBC survival &quot;in vivo&quot; (currently 75% after 24 hours). However, all of these criteria are applied in a universal manner that does not account for differences among units of product; for example, testing for the post-transfusion RBC survival &quot;in vivo&quot; is done on a sample of healthy volunteers, and then compliance is presumed for all RBC units based on universal (GMP) processing standards. RBC survival does not guarantee efficacy, but it is a necessary prerequisite for cell function, and hence serves as a regulatory proxy. Opinions vary as to the best way to determine transfusion efficacy in a patient &quot;in vivo&quot;. In general, there are not yet any &quot;in vitro&quot; tests to assess quality deterioration or preservation for specific units of RBC blood product prior to their transfusion, though there is exploration of potentially relevant tests based on RBC membrane properties such as erythrocyte deformability and erythrocyte fragility (mechanical).

Many physicians have adopted a so-called &quot;restrictive protocol&quot;—whereby transfusion is held to a minimum—due in part to the noted uncertainties surrounding storage lesion, in addition to the very high direct and indirect costs of transfusions, along with the increasing view that many transfusions are inappropriate or use too many RBC units.

===Platelet storage lesion===
Platelet storage lesion is a very different phenomenon from RBC storage lesion, due largely to the different functions of the products and purposes of the respective transfusions, along with different processing issues and inventory management considerations.

===Alternative inventory and release practices===
Although as noted the primary inventory-management approach is first in, first out (FIFO) to minimize product expiration, there are some deviations from this policy—both in current practice as well as under research. For example, exchange transfusion of RBC in neonates calls for use of blood product that is five days old or less, to &quot;ensure&quot; optimal cell function. Also, some hospital blood banks will attempt to accommodate physicians&#x27; requests to provide low-aged RBC product for certain kinds of patients (e.g. cardiac surgery).

More recently, novel approaches are being explored to complement or replace FIFO. One is to balance the desire to reduce average product age (at transfusion) with the need to maintain sufficient availability of non-outdated product, leading to a strategic blend of FIFO with last in, first out (LIFO).

===Long-term storage===
&quot;Long-term&quot; storage for all blood products is relatively uncommon, compared to routine/short-term storage. Cryopreservation of red blood cells is done to store rare units for up to ten years. The cells are incubated in a glycerol solution which acts as a cryoprotectant (&quot;antifreeze&quot;) within the cells. The units are then placed in special sterile containers in a freezer at very low temperatures. The exact temperature depends on the glycerol concentration.

<doc id="413683" wikidata="Q490825" url="?curid=413683" title="Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum">
<text>The Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum is an independent, 501(c)(3) non-profit, aviation museum in McMinnville, Oregon. Its exhibits include the Hughes H-4 Hercules (&quot;Spruce Goose&quot;) and more than fifty military and civilian aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), and spacecraft. The museum complex includes four main buildings: the original aviation exhibit hall, a large screen digital theater, a second exhibit hall focused on space technology, and a water park.

The museum is located across the highway from the former headquarters of Evergreen International Aviation and across Oregon Route 18 from McMinnville Municipal Airport (KMMV).

Founded by the owner of Evergreen International Aviation, portions of the museum facilities were purchased out of bankruptcy liquidation in April 2020 by Oregon winery The Stoller Group, but the museum is still an independent, non-profit entity.

== History ==
First envisioned by Michael King Smith, a former captain in the United States Air Force and son of Evergreen International Aviation founder Delford M. Smith, the Evergreen Museum opened in 1991 with a small collection of vintage aircraft in a hangar at company headquarters.

In March 1990, The Walt Disney Company announced that it would close the Long Beach, California, exhibit of the &quot;Spruce Goose&quot;. The Aeroclub of Southern California began looking for a new home for the historic aircraft. In 1992, the Evergreen Museum won the bid with a proposal to build a museum around the aircraft and feature it as a central exhibit.

The disassembly of the aircraft began in August 1992. The parts were sent by ship up the Pacific Ocean, Columbia River, and Willamette River to Dayton where it was transferred to trucks and driven to Evergreen International Aviation. It arrived in February 1993. For the next eight years, the plane went through detailed restoration. Volunteers removed all the paint, replaced worn parts, and repainted the entire aircraft, among many other tasks. In September 2000, the main aircraft assemblies were complete. The fuselage, wings, and tail were transported across the highway and into the new museum building, still under construction. Over the next year, crews assembled the wings and tail to the fuselage. These were completed in time for the museum&#x27;s opening on June 6, 2001. The control surfaces (flaps, ailerons, rudder, and elevators) were assembled later. The last piece was put into place on December 7, 2001.

The name of the museum has evolved. Initially known as the Evergreen Museum, it changed in 1994 to the Evergreen AirVenture Museum. In 1997, the facility was renamed the Captain Michael King Smith Evergreen Aviation Educational Center in memory of Smith, who died in an automobile accident in March 1995.

In September 2006, work began on the space museum building, a twin to the aviation museum. By this time, the museum had acquired several space-related items, and the original building was running out of room. The new building was completed in May 2008 and had its grand opening on June 6, 2008, exactly seven years after the aviation museum opened. In 2009, the museum became an affiliate in the Smithsonian Affiliations program.

Attempts to obtain a retired Space Shuttle were unsuccessful.

=== Financial difficulties ===
Several of the aircraft on display at the museum were placed up for auction in February 2014 following the bankruptcy of Evergreen International Aviation. By the following January, a bank was attempting to sell 15 aircraft that belonged to the museum founder. A deal was reached four months later for the museum to purchase 25 aircraft from a bankrupt for-profit corporation with the assistance of the Collings Foundation and a developer from Maine named George Schott. While the museum received 16 of these aircraft and a new lease on the aviation building, the space building and waterpark were listed in a foreclosure auction in November. The two buildings were purchased by Jackson Family Wines in January 2016. However, the Michael King Smith Foundation filed for bankruptcy four days later and attempted to block the sale.

In July 2016, the space building and waterpark were purchased for $10.9 million by The Falls Event Center, a company owned by Steve Down. The deal allowed the museum to pay off its remaining debt. Plans at the time called for the construction of an adjacent hotel. However, the FBI began investigating Down for fraud in October 2017. After two World War II fighter airplanes were sold despite the museum&#x27;s protests, his companies failed to pay a lease and an additional two aircraft were used as collateral for a loan, the museum sued Down&#x27;s companies. Subsequently, the Falls Event Center filed for bankruptcy.

=== Recovery ===
In April 2020, after being in official bankruptcy status four times in five years, the museum gained renewed financial stability when The Stoller Group, owner of vineyards in the area and a winery in nearby Dayton, purchased of land that included a portion of the museum and the water park; the company immediately started repair and renovation work at the museum and water park, and announced plans to expand the vineyard located on the open greenspace of the grounds.

== Facilities ==
, two exhibit centers are open to the public: The original structure is the aviation center with the &quot;Spruce Goose&quot; as centerpiece. Other aircraft, spanning the entire history of aviation, are arranged in the building, some parked under the wings of the &quot;Spruce Goose&quot; or suspended from the ceiling.

The space flight center is in a building the same size as the aviation center. Because there are fewer space-related holdings, the center includes a large number of panels and other displays that chronicle the history of space flight. Visitors can operate flight simulators for landing the Space Shuttle as well as for docking a Gemini capsule and performing a Moon landing of the Lunar Excursion Module. The building also exhibits overflow holdings from the aviation center, usually the higher-performance jet aircraft.

Two of the main attractions of the space flight center are a Titan II SLV satellite booster rocket and a SR-71 Blackbird. The Titan II sits upright in a specially constructed display extending two stories below the floor, in order to fit the 114 foot tall rocket inside the building. The exhibit includes a re-created Titan II SLV Launch Control Room outfitted with actual furnishings and equipment donated from Vandenberg Air Force Base.
An F-15 Eagle is displayed on a pedestal in front of the former EIA headquarters across the highway from the museum. A bronze statue stands by on the pathway between the aviation and space museum. Both are marked in Smith&#x27;s memory.

A smaller building contains the Evergreen Digital theater featuring a seven-story wide by six-story tall screen and multi-channel surround sound.

A radio control air flight field is located behind the aviation center.

===Wings and Waves Waterpark===

Wings &amp; Waves Waterpark opened June 6, 2011. The waterpark, Oregon&#x27;s largest, features 10 slides and a 91,703-gallon wave pool with the intent of tying into the educational focus of the Evergreen Museum Campus with its &quot;Life Needs Water&quot; interactive display in the H2O Children&#x27;s Science Center. The four big slides begin inside a retired Boeing 747-100 that sits atop the roof, above the splash landing. Additionally, across from the museum building is another Boeing 747, this one being a 747-200 delivered to Singapore Airlines in August 1973 as 9V-SIB. This aircraft would serve multiple other airlines until it was acquired by Evergreen International Airlines in 1995, where it would remain until it was retired and donated to the museum in 2013.

In April 2020, The Stoller Group purchased 285 acres of land near the museum and became owner of the museum buildings and water park, with plans to restore the water park and build a 90-room hotel.

<text>In Chinese mythology, Longmu (), transliterated as Lung Mo in Cantonese, was a Chinese woman who was deified as a goddess after raising five infant dragons. Longmu and her dragons developed a strong bond for each other and have thus become an example of filial devotion and parental love, an important virtue in Chinese culture.
==Legend==
Longmu&#x27;s historic name was Wen Shi (). She was born in 290 BC (during the Qin dynasty) in Guangdong province, near the Xi River (). Her family&#x27;s ancestral home was in the Teng County () in Guangxi province. She was the second of three daughters of Wen Tianrui () and Liang Shi ().

Wen Shi frequently went to the Xi River to fish and wash clothes for her family. On one such errand, she found a large smooth white stone along the banks of the river. She took the beautiful stone home, but later discovered that the stone was actually an egg, from which hatched five baby snakes (an alternate version says one). Wen Shi&#x27;s family was poor, but Wen Shi saved the best food she had for her baby snakes and fed them by hand. As the snakes grew, they helped Wen Shi catch fish at the Xi River. The snakes were natural swimmers and became very good at catching fish.

The snakes eventually matured into five powerful dragons. In Chinese culture, dragons are considered spirits of water and have the power to control the weather. During a drought, therefore, Wen Shi asked her dragon children to summon the rain for her village. When rain came and ended the drought, the grateful villagers gave Wen Shi the name &quot;Mother of Dragons&quot; () or &quot;Divine Human&quot; ().

Qin Shihuang, the emperor of the Qin dynasty, received word of Wen Shi and her dragons. The Emperor sent her gifts of gold and jade and requested her presence at Xianyang, the imperial capital city near the Yellow River, far to the north. By this time, Wen Shi was an elderly woman in frail health. Her adult dragons feared for her safety and did not want her to travel so far from her village. Wen Shi boarded a boat to comply with the Emperor&#x27;s commandment, but her dragons hid under the boat and dragged the boat backward so that the boat could never pass Guilin. Eventually, the frustrated imperial officials relented and allowed Wen Shi to remain home.

After Wen Shi died, the dragons were overwhelmed by sadness and took human form, becoming known as the Five Scholars (), who buried her on the northern side of Zhu Mountain ().

==Worship==
Everyone who heard the story of Longmu was touched by the filial devotion of the dragons. During the early Han dynasty, the Xiaotong Temple (), later known as the Longmu Ancestral Temple (龍母祖廟), was built in her honor. The temple is in Yuecheng () in Deqing County of Guangdong province. It features calligraphy dedicated to the goddess written by the Emperor Hong Wu of the Ming dynasty. The temple remains very popular and has been renovated 13 times over the centuries, most recently in 1905-1912 and 1985.

Another temple dedicated to Longmu is the Baisha Temple in Zhaoqing on the northern bank of the Xi River, also in Guangdong province. The temple was built in 1587, but it is not as well preserved as the Xiaotong Temple. The city declared the temple a cultural site in 1982.

Longmu&#x27;s festival is in the first week of the fifth month of the Chinese lunar calendar. She is a patron goddess of parents and children and remains a popular deity throughout China.

===Hong Kong===
Lung Mo Temples in Hong Kong are dedicated to Longmu (&quot;Lung Mo&quot; in Cantonese).

Note: A territory-wide grade reassessment of historic buildings is ongoing. The grades listed in the table are based on these updates (8 June 2023). The temples with a &quot;Not listed&quot; status in the table below are not graded and do not appear in the list of historic buildings considered for grading.

<doc id="413694" wikidata="Q1317867" url="?curid=413694" title="Cream Lemon">
<text>is an early hentai series. The first &quot;Cream Lemon&quot; OVA was released in August 1984, though &quot;Cream Lemon&quot; was not the first hentai OVA. The first was &quot;Lolita Anime&quot;, released earlier in February 1984. Patrick W. Galbraith writes that &quot;Cream Lemon&quot; &quot;was by far the longest running and most influential&quot; hentai series in the 1980s and &quot;laid the foundation for pornographic animation in Japan&quot;.

Related to &quot;Cream Lemon&quot; is the &quot;Project A-ko&quot; franchise, which was meant to be the third installment of &quot;Cream Lemon&quot; but changed during production to be a mainstream film. The only remaining indication is the bath scene with B-ko. Adult entertainment company Excalibur Films dubbed, edited, and released in English five &quot;Cream Lemon&quot; OVAs as parts two and three of their three-volume &quot;Brothers Grime X-Rated Cartoons&quot; series in 1987 and 1989. In 1987, Brazilian distributor Everest Video licensed the series and released much of it on VHS, in uncensored form.

==Plot==

&quot;Cream Lemon&quot; is a collection of sometimes surreal stories having different settings and situations, with genres including fantasy, comedy, suspense, sci-fi, action, drama, mecha, magical girl, horror, and mystery. The overriding theme of the series is sex of almost any kind imaginable. Most chapters stand alone as separate titles, having no relation to any other stories within the &quot;Cream Lemon&quot; series. The main recurring character is Ami Nonomura, who has an incestuous relationship with her step-brother Hiroshi.

&quot;Cream Lemon&quot; often focuses on unrealistic and exaggerated sexual themes. One example is the story of a teenage girl who does not like having sex because of a series of rapes in her family. To cure this, the school counselor orders her to strip in front of the art class and masturbate herself to the point of orgasm. She then has public sex with a boy and likes it, causing the whole class to start having sex. Many others are similarly surreal.
