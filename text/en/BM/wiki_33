<text>Oxfordshire County Council is the county council (upper-tier local authority) for the non-metropolitan county of Oxfordshire in the South East of England. Established in 1889, it is an elected body responsible for most strategic local government services in the county.

Oxfordshire County Council provides a wide range of services, including education (schools, libraries and youth services), social services, public health, highway maintenance, waste disposal, emergency planning, consumer protection and town and country planning for matters to do with minerals, waste, highways and education. This makes it one of the largest employers in Oxfordshire, with a gross expenditure budget of £856.2 million in 2021–22.

==History==
Elected county councils were first introduced in England and Wales in 1889 as a result of the Local Government Act 1888, taking over administrative functions until then carried out by unelected magistrates at the quarter sessions.

The areas covered by county councils were termed administrative counties. They were based on the historic counties but subject to adjustments to ensure that each urban sanitary district was contained in a single administrative county, and excluding any boroughs considered large enough to run their own county-level functions, known as county boroughs. In Oxfordshire&#x27;s case, there were three urban sanitary districts which straddled the county boundary prior to 1889: Banbury was partly in Northamptonshire, and Abingdon and Oxford both straddled the boundary between Oxfordshire and Berkshire. The county boundary was adjusted to place Banbury and Oxford entirely in Oxfordshire and Abingdon entirely in Berkshire.

The first elections were held in January 1889. Preliminary meetings were held during February and March 1889 at which several aldermen were elected. The council formally came into being on 1 April 1889, on which day it held its first official meeting at County Hall in Oxford, the courthouse which also served as the meeting place for the quarter sessions. Victor Child Villiers, 7th Earl of Jersey, a Conservative peer, was appointed the first chairman of the county council.

The city of Oxford was initially included in the administrative county, but seven months later, on 9 November 1889, the city become a county borough, making it independent from the county council and removing it from the administrative county, whilst remaining part of the geographical county of Oxfordshire.

Schools (both primary and secondary) were added to the County Council&#x27;s responsibilities in 1902, and until the 1990s it was also responsible for operating Colleges of Further Education.

Local government was significantly reformed in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. Oxfordshire was redesignated as a non-metropolitan county and had its boundaries enlarged to gain an area between the River Thames and the Berkshire Downs hills which had previously been in Berkshire. The city of Oxford was also brought back under the county council&#x27;s authority. The lower tier of local government was reorganised as part of the same reforms. Prior to 1974 it had comprised numerous boroughs, urban districts and rural districts. After 1974 the lower tier within the redefined Oxfordshire comprised five non-metropolitan districts: Cherwell, Oxford, South Oxfordshire, Vale of White Horse, and West Oxfordshire.

==Political control==
The council has been under no overall control since the 2013 election. Following the 2021 election, a coalition of the Liberal Democrats, Labour and the Greens formed to run the council, led by Liberal Democrat councillor Liz Leffman. Labour withdrew from the coalition in September 2023, since when a Liberal Democrat–Green Party alliance has been running the council as a minority administration.

Political control of the council since the 1974 reforms has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2001 have been:

=== Composition ===
Following the 2021 election and by-elections and changes of allegiance up to July 2024, the composition of the council was:

One of the independent councillors sits in a group with the Conservatives. Two of the independents and the Henley Residents Group councillor sit together as the &#x27;Independent Voice of Oxfordshire&#x27; group. The other three independents are not aligned to a group. The next election is due in 2025.

== Elections ==

Since 1889, members have been elected for a term of office, with elections held all together (initially every three years, later every four years) by the &quot;first past the post&quot; system. Until the 1970s, the elected members chose aldermen, whose term of office was for six years, and who once appointed were also voting members of the council. This form of membership was ended by the Local Government Act 1972, so that after 1974 only honorary (that is, non-voting) aldermen could be appointed.

Since the last boundary changes in 2013, the council has comprised 63 councillors representing 61 electoral divisions. Most divisions elect one councillor, but two (Thame &amp; Chinnor and Grove &amp; Wantage) elect two councillors. Elections are held every four years.

==Premises==

The council is based at County Hall on New Road in Oxford. The old part of the building was a courthouse built in 1841, which had served as the meeting place of the quarter sessions which preceded the county council. In 1912 a new building called County Offices was built at the corner of New Road and Tidmarsh Lane to provide the council&#x27;s offices; meetings continued to be held at County Hall.

The County Offices were replaced in 1973 when a large extension was added to the 1841 County Hall, bringing the council&#x27;s main offices and meeting place onto the same site.

== Meat and dairy ban controversy ==
In 2021, the Liberal Democrat/Green/Labour administration moved a motion at Full Council to serve only plant-based (vegan) meals at all council-catered events and meetings, and vegan school meals in primary schools two days a week as part of its climate change action policy. The move was unsuccessfully fought by the Conservative opposition. This policy was controversial and drew protests from livestock farmers and TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson, who owns a farm in the county. As a result of the controversy, when the motion came to the council&#x27;s Cabinet for ratification in March 2022, the proposals were scaled back to cover just seven council meetings and school meals only one day a week. In November 2022, the Conservatives unsuccessfully sought to cancel vegan meals at council-catered events, which cost £6,000 annually and are purchased from a Kidlington business which sources food from Woodstock.

<text>An antique car is an automobile that is an antique. Narrower definitions vary based on how old a car must be to qualify. The Antique Automobile Club of America defines an antique car as over 25 years of age. However, the legal definitions for the purpose of antique vehicle registration vary widely. The antique car era includes the Veteran era, the Brass era, and the Vintage era, which range from the beginning of the automobile up to the 1930s. Later cars are often described as classic cars. In original or originally restored condition antiques are very valuable and are usually either protected and stored or exhibited in car shows but are very rarely driven.

== History ==

The Veteran car era, Brass car era, and the Vintage car era, are part of the Antique car classification as all automobiles produced prior to World War I are considered to be antiques.

=== Europe ===
On Christmas Eve in 1801 Richard Trevithick of England demonstrated a steam-powered carriage, the Puffing Devil, that is considered the first horseless carriage, but Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot has the claim of the first steam-powered vehicle with the &quot;Fardier à vapeur&quot; in 1770. The first production of automobiles was by Carl Benz in 1888 in Germany and, under licence from Benz, in France by Emile Roger.

The time line is not exact but Thomas Davenport as well as Robert Anderson (of Scotland) built a battery electric car between 1832 and 1839.

=== United States ===
The era of automobiles began in the U.S. when George Selden of Rochester, NY filed a patent on May 8, 1879, but the patent was not approved until November 5, 1895. This was the first U.S. patent for an automobile. By the time a patent was approved many automobiles were in production. Charles Duryea built a three-wheeled, gasoline-powered vehicle in 1893, and his company built 13 cars of the same design in 1896. Gasoline automobiles were produced by Elwood Haynes in 1894, by Ransom Olds in 1895, Charles King and Henry Ford in 1896. Automobile races stirred the public interest and bicycle and buggy manufacturers began to convert to making automobiles.

== Racing ==
Racing began shortly after the production of the automobile. The first official auto race in the world was a 732-mile, round trip race, in the Paris–Bordeaux–Paris race. The first race in the U.S. was the six car, 54.36 mile race, from Chicago’s Jackson Park to Evanston, Illinois and back. Racing helped spur inventions that assisted in improvements to the automotive industry.

== Automobile production eras ==
=== United States ===

==== Veteran Era ====
The Veteran era began with the invention of the automobile and continued up to 1896.

==== Brass Era ====

The Brass Era is considered from 1890 to 1919. Periods of the Brass Era are referred to as the Horseless carriage era. The Horseless Carriage Club of America (HCCA) defines this era as &quot;any pioneer gas, steam and electric motor vehicle built or manufactured prior to January 1, 1916&quot;.

==== Antique era (before 1920) ====
The era of antique cars actually covers a specific time period from the beginning up to 1920 or prior to World War I. The time period for antique cars includes the Veteran Era as well as the Brass era.

==== Vintage Era ====
The vintage era followed World War I from 1920 to 1930. There were over 500 automotive companies in 1910 but by the time of the Great Depression of 1929 only 60 had survived, and twelve years later there were fewer than 20.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, the Brass era is split into two eras; the Veteran era and the Edwardian era.

==== Veteran Era====

The veteran era includes cars produced before 1905.

==== Edwardian Era ====

The Edwardian era includes cars produced between 1 January 1905 and 31 December 1918. This is considered pre-World War One cars in the United States.

==== Vintage Era ====

The Vintage era is considered to cover cars made between 1918 and 1930.

==== Post Vintage Era ====

Post vintage cars are those made from 1 January 1931 to the start of World War II (September 1939).

==== Antique Era ====

Antique cars are all cars made up to September 1939 which marked the beginning of World War II.

==== Modern Era ====

Modern cars were made after 31 December 1959.

<text>The Arg-e Bam (), located in the city of Bam, Kerman province of southeastern Iran, 
is the largest adobe building in the world. The entire building was a large fortress containing the citadel, but because the citadel dominates the ruins, the entire fortress is now named Bam Citadel.

Listed by UNESCO as part of the World Heritage Site &quot;Bam and its Cultural Landscape&quot;, it can be traced back to at least the Achaemenid Empire (sixth to fourth centuries BC). The citadel rose to importance from the seventh to eleventh centuries, as a crossroads along the Silk Road and other important trade routes, and as a producer of silk and cotton garments.

On 26 December 2003, the citadel was almost completely destroyed by an earthquake, along with much of the rest of Bam and its environs. A few days after the earthquake, the President of Iran, Mohammad Khatami, announced that the citadel would be rebuilt.

==History==
There is no precise archaeological dating of the buildings of the Citadel of Bam.

During the Parthian rule, the fort was expanded and became Arg-e-Bam, the Citadel of Bam. A comparative study, titled “Bam and a Brief History of Urban Settlement and Planning in Iran”, concluded that the essential core of the city of Bam and the Governor’s section were built during the Parthian era. Under the Sassanids, the castle was seized by Ardeshir Babakan. New fortifications and walls were constructed between 224 and 637 AD.

In 645 AD, the Kerman region was conquered by the Arabs and Arg-e-Bam probably suffered damage during the war. One of the Arab commanders established the Al Rasoul mosque, one of the first mosques built in Iran in the early Islamic era. In 656 AD, the Khawarij, a group of Muslims defeated by Ali, escaped to Kerman and Bam where they settled in the Arg-e-Bam. In 869 AD, Ya&#x27;qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar who was fighting the Abbasids, defeated the Khawarij and took over Arg-e-Bam. It then became his permanent base camp. The name of Bam is mentioned for the first time by Islamic writers in the 10th century. According to these authors, Bam was then a well established market place surrounded by a wide agricultural area. The city was famous for its elegant and tasteful cotton fabrics, its supposedly impregnable fortress, its busy bazaars, and its palm trees.

After the Mongol invasion of Iran, Bam and the Kerman region were turned over to the Qarakhataian dynasty, who ruled the region from 1240 to 1363 AD. Bam benefited from a strategic location on the spice route, connecting the region to the Silk Road. The city was renowned for silkworm breeding and a flourishing silk industry.

During the Safavid rule, from 1502 to 1722, Iran went through a period of relative calm and stability. Arg-e-Bam was considerably developed, as well as the rest of the country. The Four Seasons Palace was built during this period. Towards the end of the Safavid rule, Arg-e-Bam was conquered by the founder of the Qajar dynasty, Agha Mohammad Khan, who used the citadel as a strategic point to fend off Afghan and Baluchi incursions and thus, turned it into a military complex. In 1839, Aga Khan I, Imam of the Nizari Ismaili sect, rose up against Mohammad Shah Qajar and took refuge in Arg-e-Bam, until Prince Firooz Mirza, who was later to be known as &quot;Farman Farma&quot; (the Ruler of Rulers), arrested him. The increasing military presence within the walls of Arg-e-Bam gradually led people to settle outside the limits of the ramparts. In 1880, Firooz Mirza wrote that only military personnel were residing within the citadel area and he suggested that the old and abandoned city sitting at the foot of the citadel be demolished and the area turned into a garden. In 1900, the construction of the new city of Bam began and people progressively left the old Bam.

The citadel was used as a garrison until 1932; however, since then, the garrison and old city have been abandoned. In 1953, the site became recognized as a nationally significant historic site, and a gradual process of conservation and restoration began; however, most of the work was carried out from 1973 onwards.

After the Islamic Revolution, Arg-e-Bam was placed under the responsibility of the Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran (ICHO). In 1993, the citadel was designated as one of the most significant projects of the Cultural Heritage Organization.

==Citadel design and architecture==
The citadel is situated in the center of the fortress-city, on the point with the widest view, for security.

All buildings are made of non-baked clay bricks, i.e. adobe. Prior to the 2003 earthquake, Bam Citadel was most likely the largest adobe structure in the world.

In 1976, the Citadel was used as the major location site for Valerio Zurlini&#x27;s film, &quot;The Desert of the Tartars&quot;.

==Description of the citadel==
The citadel consists of four main sections: a residential zone, the stables, the army barracks, and the governor’s residence.

Arg-e-Bam had 38 watchtowers and four entrance gates. The outer defense wall is surrounded by a moat. The Government Quarters are on a rocky hill, protected by a double fortification wall. The most notable structures are the bazaar, the Congregational Mosque, the Mirza Na’im ensemble, and the Mir House.

==Dimensions==
Larger than the nearby Rayen Castle, the area of Bam Citadel is approximately and is surrounded by gigantic walls, high and long.

==2003 earthquake==
On 26 December 2003, at 5:26 am, Bam was struck by a major earthquake. The United States Geological Survey estimated its magnitude at 6.6, on the Richter scale. It also had a vertical acceleration of 1G. About 142,000 people were living in the Bam area, at the time. The extremely destructive quake killed about 26,200, injured thousands, and left more than 75,000 homeless. Approximately 70% of the buildings were destroyed. The earthquake was wrenching because its hypocenter was located just below the city of Bam, around 7 km deep.

The Bam area has an underground base consisting of a series of faults. The main one, called Bam Fault, had been inactive for a very long time. Though the earthquake was on the southern part of Bam, the main direction of the horizontal motion of the waves was east–west and was perpendicular to the direction of the main fault located around 3 km East of Bam. It seems that the Bam Fault channeled the energy of the earthquake in its direction, north–south, but at the same time, it acted like a boomerang or amplifier by sending back the energy on an east–west direction.

This was noted on the various sites where buildings which were mostly ruined had their main axis oriented north–south (Arg-e-Bam, Bam and the villages on the East of Bam). Therefore, they could not withstand the waves coming from the East (Bam) or West (villages east of Bam) and perpendicular to them.

Buildings that had their main axis oriented east–west were in the same direction of the seismic waves and they responded much better; some of their parts were damaged, but they were not totally ruined. They also presented the typical shear cracks when the ground motion is in the direction of the wall plane.

The structures that had been maintained and repeatedly modified or expanded over time fared much worse than did the ancient structures that had not been maintained, modified, or restored. The same intriguing phenomenon could be observed on the structures partially or entirely strengthened and restored during the late 20th century.

==Consequences of the earthquake==

The citadel, including the governor’s residence, the main tower, the Chahar Fasl (Four Seasons) turret, and the hammam, were nearly totally destroyed, especially because of their location on top of the hill. The rocky hill concentrated the energy of the earthquake. In addition, these buildings collapsed because their foundations were resting on inhomogeneous ground, made of rocks and earth filling. The earth filling slipped with the ground motion. The city at the foot of the castle was nearly flattened, especially the parts that previously had been restored. Most of the vaulted roofs were cracked or severely damaged.

No restoration had been undertaken for the Konariha quarter, before the earthquake. It was already severely ruined, and there were just a few structures left, of eroded vaults and domes. Paradoxically, this part of the city had less damage than the part which had been restored, though the ramparts all around collapsed. Only a few walls collapsed and some remnants, of already broken vaulted roofs, fell down.

No restoration had been undertaken either for the Zoroastrian temple, just behind Arg-e-Bam, or the Khale Dokhtar citadel, 2 km North of Arg-e-Bam. Before the earthquake, they already were severely ruined and the earthquake did not damage them, as much as the restored city of Arg-e-Bam. The Khale Dokhtar citadel did not have many vaulted roofs left, before the earthquake. The main damage was a tower, and some additional debris from previously collapsed vaults and domes. The Khale Dokhtar citadel can be traced back to the Sassanid Period, and is believed to be older than Arg-e-Bam.

Three kilometers east of Arg-e-Bam are the Summer Pavilion, Kushk Rahim Abad, and an old caravanserai. Both were not damaged further by the earthquake. The summer pavilion was already severely ruined before the earthquake. The old caravanserai had been abandoned long ago, and some of its parts had previously collapsed. In fact, the earthquake damaged this caravanserai very little, compared to the average situation in Arg-e-Bam, Bam, and the villages further east. The reason seemed that it was well built with sound details, compared to the average building quality of the area.

<text>GraphCalc is an open-source computer program that runs in Microsoft Windows and Linux that provides the functionality of a graphing calculator.

GraphCalc includes many of the standard features of graphing calculators, but also includes some higher-end features:
* High resolution
** Graphing calculator screens have a resolution typically less than 120×90 pixels, whereas computer monitors typically display 1280x1024 pixels or more.
* Speed
** Modern computers are considerably faster than handheld graphing calculators
* Three-dimensional graphing
** While high-end graphing calculators can graph in 3-D, GraphCalc benefits from modern computers&#x27; memory, speed, and graphics acceleration (OpenGL)

GraphCalc was developed by Brendan Fields and Mike Arrison, computer science students at Bucknell University, before graduating in 2000. Mike continued the development briefly from 2001–2003, but has since abandoned the project. Other similar projects being maintained are KAlgebra and Cantor.

<doc id="415742" wikidata="Q332864" url="?curid=415742" title="William Waldegrave, Baron Waldegrave of North Hill">
<text>William Arthur Waldegrave, Baron Waldegrave of North Hill (; born 15 August 1946) is a British Conservative Party politician who served as a Cabinet minister from 1990 until 1997, and is a life member of the Tory Reform Group. Since 1999, he has been a life peer in the House of Lords. Lord Waldegrave was Provost of Eton College from 2009 to 2024. Additionally, he was Chancellor of the University of Reading from 2016 to 2022. 

Waldegrave&#x27;s 2015 memoir, &quot;A Different Kind of Weather&quot;, discusses his high youthful political ambition, his political and to some extent personal life, and growing acceptance that he would not achieve his ultimate ambition. It also provides an account of the Heath, Thatcher and—to a lesser extent—Major governments, including his role in the development of the Poll Tax or community charge. It includes a chapter entitled &#x27;The Poll Tax – all my own work&#x27;.

Waldegrave served as a Trustee (1992–2011) and Chair (2002–2011) of the Rhodes Trust, during which time he also helped to create and served as a Trustee of the Mandela Rhodes Foundation. His portrait hangs at Rhodes House, Oxford.

He was the Chairman of Trustees of the National Museum of Science and Industry from 2002 to 2010.

==Early life==
Bearing the title &quot;The Honourable&quot; from birth as a younger son of an Earl, Waldegrave was the youngest (by six years) of the seven children of Geoffrey Waldegrave, 12th Earl Waldegrave and his wife Mary Hermione Grenfell. His elder brother is the present Earl. His father&#x27;s title was created five generations earlier for the diplomat and ambassador James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave, whose grandfather was James II and VII.

Waldegrave is the nephew of the courtier Dame Frances Campbell-Preston and one of his sisters is Lady Susan Hussey, who became Baroness Hussey of North Bradley upon her husband&#x27;s elevation to the House of Lords.

===Education===
Waldegrave was privately educated at Eton College, where he won the Newcastle Scholarship in 1965. He then studied at the University of Oxford where he was an undergraduate student of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. During his study, he served for a term as president of the Oxford Union and the Oxford University Conservative Association. Oxford was followed by Harvard University in the United States, on a Kennedy Scholarship. In 1971, he was elected a Prize Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, and is now a distinguished fellow.

==Early career==
In 1971, Waldegrave was working at the Conservative Research Department; that March he was appointed to the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS, also referred to as the &#x27;Think-Tank&#x27;). &quot;He was from the beginning one of the most active &#x27;philosophers&#x27; of the CPRS, and the proponent of strong views about its proper roles and functions&quot;. He was one of the few openly political members of the staff and was used by Victor Rothschild, head of the CPRS, as a link with both the Conservative party (then in government) and the outside, non-Civil Service world. He left in December 1973.

==Parliamentary career==

He was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bristol West in 1979. He was regarded as a member of the &quot;wet&quot; or moderate tendency of the Conservative Party, and despite this progressed well from the backbenches in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government.

===As junior minister===
He became a Parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Department of Education and Science in 1981 before moving to the Department of the Environment in 1983. He remained at Environment, becoming a Minister of State in 1985, until he became a Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 1988. In this post he was involved in setting policy on arms exports to Iraq; the initial draft of the Scott Report found that he had agreed in February 1989 to relax the policy, but had sent out 38 untrue letters to Members of Parliament stating that the policy was unchanged. However, Sir Richard Scott exonerated Waldegrave of &quot;duplicitous intent&quot; in wrongly describing the Government&#x27;s policy.

===As a Cabinet minister===
He was promoted to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Health in November 1990, just days before Thatcher&#x27;s resignation, and remained a member of the Cabinet throughout John Major&#x27;s time as Prime Minister. He became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in the Cabinet Office with responsibility for public services and science in 1992, Secretary of State of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 1994 and Chief Secretary to the Treasury in 1995.

===As member of the House of Lords===
After losing his Commons seat to Valerie Davey in the 1997 general election, he entered the House of Lords being created a life peer as Baron Waldegrave of North Hill, &quot;of Chewton Mendip in the County of Somerset&quot;, on 28 July 1999.

==Private sector==
Lord Waldegrave was a Director of Adam &amp; Company, a member of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, from 2017 to 2018. He has been a Director of Coutts &amp; Company, also a member of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, since 2012. He is currently non-executive director of GW Pharmaceuticals, which is involved in the cannabis business.

==Personal life==
He is married to Caroline Burrows, cookery writer and managing director of Leith&#x27;s School of Food and Wine. They have four children, Katherine, Elizabeth, James and Harriet.

Waldegrave is a trustee of Cumberland Lodge, an educational charity. He is an active member of the Board of Managers for the Lewis Walpole Library, Yale University.

==Other notable events==
Waldegrave attended Bilderberg Group meetings four times: 1987, 1988, 1990 and 1995.

In 1993, when he was the British science minister Waldegrave offered a prize for the best lay explanation of the Higgs Boson. He had observed that British taxpayers were paying a lot of money (in contributions to CERN) for something very few of them understood, and he challenged UK particle physicists to explain, in a simple manner on one piece of paper, &#x27;What is the Higgs Boson, and why do we want to find it?&#x27;

Professor David Miller&#x27;s metaphor, which he entitled &quot;A quasi-political explanation of the Higgs boson&quot;, is probably the most quoted explanation of the Higgs Boson and won the prize:

*Miller asked his listeners to imagine a room full of Conservative party workers quietly talking to one another. This represents the Higgs field in space.
*A former Conservative Prime Minister enters the room. All the workers she passes are strongly attracted to her. As she moves through the room, the cluster of admirers around her create resistance to her movement, and she becomes &#x27;heavier&#x27;. This can be imagined as how a particle moves through the Higgs field. The field clusters around a particle, resisting its motion and giving it mass.
*If a sleazy rumour crosses the room, it creates the same sort of clustering. The workers gather together to hear the details, the cluster can move across the room as the workers pass on the details to their neighbours. This cluster is the Higgs particle or Higgs Boson.

<doc id="415767" wikidata="Q593774" url="?curid=415767" title="1953 Iranian coup d'état">
<text>The 1953 Iranian coup d&#x27;état, known in Iran as the 28 Mordad coup d&#x27;état (), was the U.S.- and British-instigated, Iranian army-led overthrow of the Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favor of strengthening the autocratic rule of the shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, on 19 August 1953, with the objectives being to protect British oil interests in Iran after its government refused to concede to western oil demands. It was instigated by the United States (under the name TP-AJAX Project or Operation Ajax) and the United Kingdom (under the name Operation Boot). This began a period of dissolution for Iranian democracy and society whose effects on civil rights are prevalent to this day.

Mosaddegh had sought to audit the documents of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), a British corporation (now part of BP), to verify that AIOC was paying the contracted royalties to Iran, and to limit the company&#x27;s control over Iranian oil reserves. Upon the AIOC&#x27;s refusal to cooperate with the Iranian government, the parliament (Majlis) voted to nationalize Iran&#x27;s oil industry and to expel foreign corporate representatives from the country. After this vote, Britain instigated a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil to pressure Iran economically. Initially, Britain mobilized its military to seize control of the British-built Abadan oil refinery, then the world&#x27;s largest, but Prime Minister Clement Attlee (in power until 1951) opted instead to tighten the economic boycott while using Iranian agents to undermine Mosaddegh&#x27;s government. Judging Mosaddegh to be unamenable and fearing the growing influence of the communist Tudeh, UK prime minister Winston Churchill and the Eisenhower administration decided in early 1953 to overthrow Iran&#x27;s government. The preceding Truman administration had opposed a coup, fearing the precedent that Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) involvement would set, and the U.S. government had been considering unilateral action (without UK support) to assist the Mosaddegh government as late as 1952. British intelligence officials&#x27; conclusions and the UK government&#x27;s solicitations to the US were instrumental in initiating and planning the coup.

Following the coup, a government under General Fazlollah Zahedi was formed which allowed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the shah of Iran (Persian for &#x27;king&#x27;), to rule more firmly as monarch. He relied heavily on United States support to hold on to power. According to the CIA&#x27;s declassified documents and records, some of the most feared mobsters in Tehran were hired by the CIA to stage pro-shah riots on 19 August. Other men paid by the CIA were brought into Tehran in buses and trucks and took over the streets of the city. Between 200 and 300 people were killed because of the conflict. Mosaddegh was arrested, tried and convicted of treason by the Shah&#x27;s military court. On 21 December 1953, he was sentenced to three years in jail, then placed under house arrest for the remainder of his life. Other Mosaddegh supporters were imprisoned, and several received the death penalty. The coup strengthened the Shah&#x27;s authority, and he continued to rule Iran for the next 26 years as a pro-Western monarch until he was overthrown in the Iranian Revolution in 1979.

In August 2013, the U.S. government formally acknowledged the U.S. role in the coup by releasing a bulk of previously classified government documents that show it was in charge of both the planning and the execution of the coup. According to American journalist Stephen Kinzer, the operation included false flag attacks, paid protesters, provocations, the bribing of Iranian politicians and high-ranking security and army officials, as well as pro-coup propaganda. The CIA is quoted acknowledging the coup was carried out &quot;under CIA direction&quot; and &quot;as an act of U.S. foreign policy, conceived and approved at the highest levels of government&quot;. In 2023, the CIA took credit for the coup, contradicting a previous scholarly assessment that the CIA had botched the operation.

==Background==

Throughout the 19th century, Iran was caught between two advancing imperial powers, Russia and Britain. In 1892, the British diplomat George Curzon described Iran as &quot;pieces on a chessboard upon which is being played out a game for the dominion of the world.&quot; During the latter half of the 19th century, the concession policies of the monarchy faced increased opposition. In 1872, a representative of British entrepreneur Paul Reuter met with the Iranian monarch Naser al-Din Shah Qajar and agreed to fund the monarch&#x27;s upcoming lavish visit to Europe in return for exclusive contracts for Iranian roads, telegraphs, mills, factories, extraction of resources, and other public works, in which Reuter would receive a stipulated sum for five years and 60% of all the net revenue for 20 years. However, the so-called &quot;Reuter concession&quot; was never put into effect because of violent opposition at home and from Russia. In 1892 the Shah was forced to revoke a tobacco monopoly given to Major G. F. Talbot, following protests and a widespread tobacco boycott.

In 1901, Mozzafar al-Din Shah Qajar granted a 60-year petroleum search concession to William Knox D&#x27;Arcy. D&#x27;Arcy paid £20,000 (equivalent to £ million in ), according to journalist-turned-historian Stephen Kinzer, and promised equal ownership shares, with 16% of any future net profit, as calculated by the company. However, the historian L. P. Elwell-Sutton wrote, in 1955, that &quot;Persia&#x27;s share was &#x27;hardly spectacular&#x27; and no money changed hands.&quot; On 31 July 1907, D&#x27;Arcy withdrew from his private holdings in Persia, and transferred them to the British-owned Burmah Oil Company. On 26 May 1908 the company struck oil at a depth of . The company grew slowly until World War I, when Persia&#x27;s strategic importance led the British government to buy a controlling share in the company, essentially nationalizing British oil production in Iran.

The British angered the Persians by intervening in their domestic affairs, including in the Persian Constitutional Revolution. Massive popular protests had forced Mozzafar al-Din Shah to allow for the Constitution of 1906, which limited his powers. It allowed for a parliament elected by the people to make the laws, and a prime minister to sign and carry them out. The prime minister would be confirmed by the shah after a vote in Parliament. Nevertheless, the new constitution gave the shah many executive powers as well. It allowed for the shah to issue royal decrees (Farman), gave him the power to dismiss prime ministers, appoint half of the members of the Senate (which was not convened until 1949), and introduce bills to dissolve Parliament. It abolished arbitrary rule, but the shah served as an executive, rather than in a ceremonial role. The Constitutional Revolution was opposed by the British and Russians, who attempted to subvert it through the backing of Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar (the son of Mozzafar-e-din Shah), who tried to break up the democratic government by force. A guerrilla movement led by Sattar Khan deposed him in 1910.

In the aftermath of World War I there was widespread political dissatisfaction with the royalty terms of the British petroleum concession, under the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC), whereby Persia received 16% of &quot;net profits&quot;. In 1921, after years of severe mismanagement under the Qajar dynasty, a coup d&#x27;état (allegedly backed by the British) brought a general, Reza Khan, into the government. By 1923, he had become prime minister, and gained a reputation as an effective politician with a lack of corruption. By 1925 under his influence, Parliament voted to remove Ahmad Shah Qajar from the throne, and Reza Khan was crowned Reza Shah Pahlavi, of the Pahlavi dynasty. Reza Shah began a rapid and successful modernization program in Persia, which up until that point had been considered to be among the most impoverished countries in the world. Nevertheless, Reza Shah was also a very harsh ruler who did not tolerate dissent. By the 1930s, he had suppressed all opposition, and had sidelined the democratic aspects of the constitution. Opponents were jailed and in some cases even executed. While some agreed with his policies, arguing that it was necessary as Iran was in such turmoil, others argued that it was unjustified. One such opponent was a politician named Mohammad Mosaddegh, who was jailed in 1940. The experience gave him a lasting dislike for authoritarian rule and monarchy, and it helped make Mosaddegh a dedicated advocate of complete oil nationalization in Iran.

Reza Shah attempted to attenuate the power of the colonial forces in Iran, and was successful to a large extent. However, he also needed them to help modernize the country. He did so by balancing the influence of various colonial powers, including that of Britain and Germany. In the 1930s, Reza Shah tried to terminate the APOC concession that the Qajar dynasty had granted, but Iran was still weak and Britain would not allow it. The concession was renegotiated on terms again favorable to the British (although the D&#x27;Arcy Concession was softened). On 21 March 1935, Reza Shah changed the name of the country from Persia to Iran. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company was then renamed the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC).

In 1941, after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, British and Soviet forces invaded and occupied Iran, which was largely unopposed by the Iranian government and military. After World War II had broken out, Reza Shah had declared Iran&#x27;s neutrality, and attempted to appease the British, Soviets and Germans, all of whom maintained a degree of influence in Iran. The primary reasons behind the Anglo-Soviet invasion was to remove German influence in Iran and secure control over Iran&#x27;s oil fields and the Trans-Iranian Railway in order to deliver supplies to the USSR. Reza Shah was deposed and exiled by the British to South Africa, and his 22-year-old son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was installed as the new Shah of Iran. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was supported by the Allies because they viewed him as being less able to act against their interests in Iran. The new Shah, unlike his father, was initially a mild leader and at times indecisive. During the 1940s he did not for most part take an independent role in the government, and much of Reza Shah&#x27;s authoritarian policies were rolled back. Iranian democracy effectively was restored during this period as a result.

The British occupational force withdrew from Iran after the end of the war. However, under Stalin, the Soviet Union partly remained by sponsoring two &quot;People&#x27;s Democratic Republics&quot; within Iran&#x27;s borders. The related conflict was ended when the US lobbied for the Iranian Army to reassert control over the two occupied territories. The earlier agreed-upon Soviet-Iranian oil agreement would never be honored. Nationalist leaders in Iran became influential by seeking a reduction in long-term foreign interventions in their country—especially the oil concession which was very profitable for the West and not very profitable for Iran.

U.S. objectives in the Middle East remained the same between 1947 and 1952 but its strategy changed. Washington remained &quot;publicly in solidarity and privately at odds&quot; with Britain, its World War II ally. Britain&#x27;s empire was steadily weakening, and with an eye on international crises, the U.S. re-appraised its interests and the risks of being identified with British colonial interests. &quot;In Saudi Arabia, to Britain&#x27;s extreme disapproval, Washington endorsed the arrangement between ARAMCO and Saudi Arabia in the 50/50 accord that had reverberations throughout the region.&quot;

Iran&#x27;s oil had been discovered and later controlled by the British-owned AIOC. Popular discontent with the AIOC began in the late 1940s: a large segment of Iran&#x27;s public and a number of politicians saw the company as exploitative and a central tool of continued British imperialism in Iran.

==Oil nationalization crisis==
===Assassination attempt on the Shah; Mosaddegh becomes prime minister===
In 1949, an assassin attempted to kill the Shah. Shocked by the experience and emboldened by public sympathy for his injury, the Shah began to take an increasingly active role in politics. He quickly organized the Iran Constituent Assembly to amend the constitution to increase his powers. He established the Senate of Iran, which had been a part of the Constitution of 1906 but had never been convened. The Shah had the right to appoint half the senators, and he chose men sympathetic to his aims. Mosaddegh thought this increase in the Shah&#x27;s political power was not democratic; he believed that the Shah should &quot;reign, but not rule&quot; in a manner similar to Europe&#x27;s constitutional monarchies. Led by Mosaddegh, political parties and opponents of the Shah&#x27;s policies banded together to form a coalition known as the National Front. Oil nationalization was a major policy goal for the party.

By 1951, the National Front had won majority seats for the popularly elected Majlis (Parliament of Iran). According to Iran&#x27;s constitution, the majority elected party in the parliament would choose its prime minister candidate by vote, after which the Shah would confirm the candidate to power. The Prime Minister Haj Ali Razmara, who opposed the oil nationalization, was assassinated by the hardline Fadaiyan e-Islam (whose spiritual leader the Ayatollah Abol-Qassem Kashani, a mentor to the future Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, After the National Front dominated the voting in Parliament, Mosaddegh was confirmed prime minister of Iran by the Shah (replacing Hossein Ala, who had replaced Razmara). Under heavy pressure by the National Front, the assassin of Razmara (Khalil Tahmasebi) was released and pardoned. For the time being, Mosaddegh and Kashani were allies of convenience, as Mosaddegh saw that Kashani could mobilize the &quot;religious masses&quot;, while Kashani wanted Mosaddegh to drive out British and other foreign influence. Kashani&#x27;s Fadaiyan mobs often violently attacked the opponents of nationalization and opponents of the National Front government, as well as &quot;immoral objects&quot;, acting at times as unofficial &quot;enforcers&quot; for the movement. However, by late 1952 Mosaddegh was becoming increasingly opposed to Kashani, as the latter was contributing to mass political instability in Iran. Kashani in turn, berated Mosaddegh for not &quot;Islamizing&quot; Iran, as he was a firm believer in the separation of religion and state.

The Shah and his new prime minister Mosaddegh had an antagonistic relationship. Part of the problem stemmed from the fact that Mosaddegh was connected by blood to the former royal Qajar dynasty, and saw the Pahlavi king as a usurper to the throne. But the real issue stemmed from the fact that Mosaddegh represented a pro-democratic force that wanted to temper the Shah&#x27;s rule in Iranian politics. He wanted the Shah to be a ceremonial monarch rather than a ruling monarch, thus giving the elected government power over the un-elected Shah. While the constitution of Iran gave the Shah the power to rule directly, Mosaddegh used the united National Front bloc and the widespread popular support for the oil nationalization vote (the latter which the Shah supported as well) in order to block the Shah&#x27;s ability to act. As a result, the oil nationalization issue became increasingly intertwined with Mosaddegh&#x27;s pro-democracy movement. The dejected Shah was angered by Mosaddegh&#x27;s &quot;insolence&quot; (according to Abbas Milani, he angrily paced in the rooms of his palace at the thought that he would be reduced to a figurehead). But Mosaddegh and the oil nationalization&#x27;s popularity prevented the Shah from acting against his prime minister (which was allowed under Iran&#x27;s constitution, something that Mosaddegh felt a king had no right to do). In 1952 the Shah dismissed Mosaddegh, replacing him with Ahmad Qavam (a veteran prime minister). But widespread protests by Mosaddegh supporters resulted in the Shah immediately reinstating him.

===Oil nationalization, the Abadan crisis, and rising tensions===
In late 1951, Iran&#x27;s Parliament in a near unanimous vote approved the oil nationalization agreement. The bill was widely popular among most Iranians, and generated a huge wave of nationalism, and immediately put Iran at loggerheads with Britain (the handful of MPs that disagreed with it voted for it as well in the face of overwhelming popular support, and the Fadaiyan&#x27;s wrath). The nationalization made Mosaddegh instantly popular among millions of Iranians, cementing him as a national hero, and placing him and Iran at the centre of worldwide attention.

Britain now faced the newly elected nationalist government in Iran where Mosaddegh, with strong backing of the Iranian parliament and people, demanded more favorable concessionary arrangements, which Britain vigorously opposed.

The U.S. State Department not only rejected Britain&#x27;s demand that it continue to be the primary beneficiary of Iranian oil reserves but &quot;U.S. international oil interests were among the beneficiaries of the concessionary arrangements that followed nationalization.&quot;

Mohammad Mosaddegh attempted to negotiate with the AIOC, but the company rejected his proposed compromise. Mosaddegh&#x27;s plan, based on the 1948 compromise between the Venezuelan Government of Rómulo Gallegos and Creole Petroleum, would divide the profits from oil 50/50 between Iran and Britain. Against the recommendation of the United States, Britain refused this proposal and began planning to undermine and overthrow the Iranian government.

In July 1951, the American diplomat Averell Harriman went to Iran to negotiate an Anglo-Iranian compromise, asking the Shah&#x27;s help; his reply was that &quot;in the face of public opinion, there was no way he could say a word against nationalisation&quot;. Harriman held a press conference in Tehran, calling for reason and enthusiasm in confronting the &quot;nationalisation crisis&quot;. As soon as he spoke, a journalist rose and shouted: &quot;We and the Iranian people all support Premier Mosaddegh and oil nationalisation!&quot; Everyone present began cheering and then marched out of the room; the abandoned Harriman shook his head in dismay.

On a visit to the United States in October 1951, Mosaddegh—in spite of the popularity of nationalization in Iran—agreed in talks with George C. McGhee to a complex settlement of the crisis involving the sale of the Abadan Refinery to a non-British company and Iranian control of the extraction of crude oil. The US waited until Winston Churchill became prime minister to present the deal, believing he would be more flexible, but the deal was rejected by the British.

By September 1951, the British had virtually ceased Abadan oil field production, forbidden British export to Iran of key British commodities (including sugar and steel), and had frozen Iran&#x27;s hard currency accounts in British banks. British Prime Minister Clement Attlee considered seizing the Abadan Oil Refinery by force, but instead settled on an embargo by the Royal Navy, stopping any ship transporting Iranian oil for carrying so-called &quot;stolen property&quot;. On his re-election as prime minister, Winston Churchill took an even harder stance against Iran.

The United Kingdom took its anti-nationalization case against Iran to the International Court of Justice at The Hague; PM Mosaddegh said the world would learn of a &quot;cruel and imperialistic country&quot; stealing from a &quot;needy and naked people&quot;. The court ruled that it had no jurisdiction over the case. Nevertheless, the British continued to enforce the embargo of Iranian oil. In August 1952, Iranian Prime Minister Mosaddegh invited an American oil executive to visit Iran and the Truman administration welcomed the invitation. However, the suggestion upset Churchill, who insisted that the U.S. not undermine his campaign to isolate Mosaddegh because of British support for the U.S. in the Korean War.

In mid-1952, Britain&#x27;s embargo of Iranian oil was devastatingly effective. British agents in Tehran &quot;worked to subvert&quot; the government of Mosaddegh, who sought help from President Truman and then the World Bank but to no avail. &quot;Iranians were becoming poorer and unhappier by the day&quot; and Mosaddegh&#x27;s political coalition was fraying. To make matters worse, the Speaker of the Parliament Ayatollah Kashani, Mosaddegh&#x27;s main clerical supporter, became increasingly opposed to the Prime Minister, because Mosaddegh was squeezing him out of power. By 1953, he had completely turned on him, and supported the coup, depriving Mosaddegh of religious support, while giving it to the Shah.

While the National Front, which often supported Mosaddegh, won handily in the big cities, there was no one to monitor voting in the rural areas. Violence broke out in Abadan and other parts of the country where elections were hotly contested. Faced with having to leave Iran for The Hague where Britain was suing for control of Iranian oil, Mosaddegh&#x27;s cabinet voted to postpone the remainder of the election until after the return of the Iranian delegation from The Hague:

To make matters worse, the Communist Tudeh Party, which supported the Soviet Union and had attempted to kill the Shah only four years earlier, began to infiltrate the military and send mobs to &quot;support Mosaddegh&quot; (but in reality to marginalize all non-Communist opponents). Earlier, the Tudeh had denounced Mosaddegh, but by 1953 they changed tack and decided to &quot;support&quot; him. The Tudeh violently attacked opponents under the guise of helping the prime minister (the cousin of the future queen of Iran, Farah Pahlavi, was stabbed at the age of 13 in his school by Tudeh activists), and unwittingly helped cause Mosaddegh&#x27;s reputation to decline, despite the fact that he never officially endorsed them. However, by 1953 he and the Tudeh had formed an unofficial alliance of convenience with each other; the Tudeh were the &quot;foot soldiers&quot; for his government, effectively replacing the Fadaiyan in that role, all the while secretly hoping that Mosaddegh would institute communism.

Worried about Britain&#x27;s other interests in Iran, and thanks to the Tudeh Party, believing that Iran&#x27;s nationalism was really a Soviet-backed plot, Britain persuaded US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that Iran was falling to the Soviets—effectively exploiting the American Cold War mindset. Since President Harry S. Truman was busy fighting a war in Korea, he did not agree to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. However, in 1953, when Dwight D. Eisenhower became president, the UK convinced the U.S. to undertake a joint coup d&#x27;état.

===Final months of Mosaddegh&#x27;s government===
By 1953, economic tensions caused by the British embargo and political turmoil began to take a major toll on Mosaddegh&#x27;s popularity and political power. He was increasingly blamed for the economic and political crisis. Political violence was becoming widespread in the form of street clashes between rival political groups. Mosaddegh was losing popularity and support among the working class which had been his strongest supporters. As he lost support, he became more autocratic. As early as August 1952, he began to rely on emergency powers to rule, generating controversy among his supporters. After an assassination attempt upon one of his cabinet ministers and himself, he ordered the jailing of dozens of his political opponents. This act created widespread anger among the general public, and led to accusations that Mosaddegh was becoming a dictator. The Tudeh Party&#x27;s unofficial alliance with Mosaddegh led to fears of communism, and increasingly it was the communists who were taking part in pro-Mosaddegh rallies and attacking opponents.

By mid-1953 a mass of resignations by Mosaddegh&#x27;s parliamentary supporters reduced the National Front seats in Parliament. A referendum to dissolve parliament and give the prime minister power to make law was submitted to voters, and it passed with 99.9 percent approval, 2,043,300 votes to 1300 votes against. The referendum was widely seen by opponents as treason and an act against the Shah, who was stripped of military power and control over national resources. This act would be one of many key factors in a chain of events leading to Mosaddegh&#x27;s deposition.

The Shah himself initially opposed the coup plans and supported the oil nationalization, but he joined in after being informed by the CIA that he too would be &quot;deposed&quot; if he didn&#x27;t play along. The experience left him with a lifelong awe of American power and would contribute to his pro-US policies while generating a hatred of the British. Mosaddegh&#x27;s decision to dissolve Parliament also contributed to his decision.

==Execution of Operation Ajax==
The official pretext for the start of the coup was Mosaddegh&#x27;s decree to dissolve Parliament, giving himself and his cabinet complete power to rule, while effectively stripping the Shah of his powers. It resulted in him being accused of giving himself &quot;total and dictatorial powers.&quot; The Shah, who had been resisting the CIA&#x27;s demands for the coup, finally agreed to support it.
Having obtained the Shah&#x27;s concurrence, the CIA executed the coup. Firmans (royal decrees) dismissing Mosaddegh and appointing General Fazlollah Zahedi (a loyalist who had helped Reza Shah reunify Iran decades earlier) were drawn up by the coup plotters and signed by the Shah. Having signed the decrees and delivered them to General Zahedi, he and Queen Soraya departed for a week-long vacation in northern Iran. On Saturday 15 August, Colonel Nematollah Nassiri, the commander of the Imperial Guard, delivered to Mosaddegh a firman from the Shah dismissing him. Mosaddegh, who had been warned of the plot, probably by the Communist Tudeh Party, rejected the firman and had Nassiri arrested. Mosaddegh argued at his trial after the coup that under the Iranian constitutional monarchy, the Shah had no constitutional right to issue an order for the elected Prime Minister&#x27;s dismissal without Parliament&#x27;s consent. However, the constitution at the time did allow for such an action, which Mosaddegh considered unfair. Mosaddegh&#x27;s supporters took to the streets in violent protests. Following the failed coup attempt, the Shah, accompanied by his second wife Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiari and Aboul Fath Atabay fled to Baghdad. Arriving unannounced, the Shah asked for permission for himself and his consort to stay in Baghdad for a few days before continuing on to Europe. After high-level Government consultations, they were escorted to the White House, the Iraqi Government&#x27;s guest house, before flying to Italy in a plane flown by Mohammad Amir Khatami.

After the first coup attempt failed, General Zahedi, declaring that he was the rightful prime minister of Iran, shuttled between multiple safe houses attempting to avoid arrest. Mosaddegh ordered security forces to capture the coup plotters, and dozens were imprisoned. Believing that he had succeeded, and that he was in full control of the government, Mosaddegh erred. Assuming that the coup had failed, he asked his supporters to return to their homes and to continue with their lives as normal. The Tudeh party members also returned to their homes, no longer carrying out enforcement duties. The CIA was ordered to leave Iran, although Kermit Roosevelt Jr. was slow to receive the message—allegedly due to MI6 interference—and eagerly continued to foment anti-Mosaddegh unrest. The Eisenhower administration considered changing its policy to support Mosaddegh, with undersecretary of state Walter Bedell Smith remarking on 17 August: &quot;Whatever his faults, Mosaddegh had no love for the Russians and timely aid might enable him to keep Communism in check.&quot;

General Zahedi, who was still on the run, secretly met with the pro-Shah Ayatollah Mohammad Behbahani and other Shah supporters. Backed by CIA money (derisively known as &quot;Behbahani dollars&quot;), they developed a strategy to stoke class and religious resentment toward the Mossadegh government. The Shah&#x27;s flight from Iran, Mosaddegh&#x27;s arrests of political opponents, and fears of communism had already soured many upper-class Iranians on the prime minister. The plotters sought to capitalize on these anxieties. The Ayatollah Behbahani also used his influence to rally religious demonstrators against Mosaddegh.

On 19 August, Mossadegh issued a decree banning all demonstrations on that day. However, mobilization of crowds and street protests widely believed to have been organized with CIA assistance, had occurred to create the impression of popular unrest and opposition to Mossadegh&#x27;s government. Bloody street battles were observed to have broken out in Tehran between Tudeh Party activists and right wing parties, whose offices were attacked by the communists. At the same time pro-Shah crowds began gathering in the streets. By the middle of the day, large crowds of regular citizens, armed with improvised weapons, took to the streets in mass demonstrations, and beat back the Tudeh Party members. Under Zahedi&#x27;s authority, the army left its barracks and drove off the communist Tudeh and then stormed all government buildings with the support of demonstrators. Mosaddegh fled after a tank fired a single shell into his house, but he later turned himself in to the army&#x27;s custody. To prevent further bloodshed, he refused a last attempt to organize his supporters. By the end of the day, Zahedi and the army were in control of the government.

According to Hugh Wilford in his book published in 2013, despite the CIA&#x27;s role in creating the conditions for the coup, there was little evidence to prove that Kermit Roosevelt Jr. or other CIA officials were directly responsible for the actions of the demonstrators or the army on 19 August. It has even been suggested that Roosevelt&#x27;s activities between 15 and 19 August were primarily intended to organize &quot;stay-behind networks as part of the planned CIA evacuation of the country&quot;, although they allowed him to later &quot;claim responsibility for the day&#x27;s outcome.&quot; Middle East scholar Amir Taheri wrote in 1991 that the CIA operation failed on 14 August, and that mistakes by Mosaddegh, and the popular fear of Russian control of Iran, allowed the 19 August uprising to happen. In 2014, historian Ray Takeyh stated that the US-led coup attempt was unsuccessful, citing how the CIA wrote to Eisenhower that &quot;The move failed [...] We now [...] probably have to snuggle up to Mosaddeq if we&#x27;re going to save [our influence in Iran];&quot; the demonstrations that led to Mosaddegh&#x27;s resignation took place some weeks after the Roosevelt-organized ones, and were composed of average citizens, not the thugs-for-hire that the CIA and MI6 had recruited. However in 2017, the CIA released documents revealing that the networks established by British intelligence services had been used to run a campaign of propaganda and paid-for protests, resulting in the rapid destabilization of the nation.

The Shah stayed in a hotel in Italy until he learned what had transpired, upon which he &quot;chokingly declared&quot;: &quot;I knew they loved me.&quot; Allen Dulles, the director of the CIA, flew back with the Shah from Rome to Tehran. Zahedi officially replaced Mosaddegh. Mosaddegh was arrested, tried, and originally sentenced to death. But on the Shah&#x27;s personal orders, his sentence was commuted to three years&#x27; solitary confinement in a military prison, followed by house arrest until his death.

==United States&#x27; role==
As a condition for restoring the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, in 1954 the US required removal of the AIOC&#x27;s monopoly; five American petroleum companies, Royal Dutch Shell, and the Compagnie Française des Pétroles, were to draw Iran&#x27;s petroleum after the successful coup d&#x27;état—Operation Ajax. The Shah declared this to be a &quot;victory&quot; for Iranians, with the massive influx of money from this agreement resolving the economic collapse from the last three years, and allowing him to carry out his planned modernization projects.

As part of that, the CIA organized anti-Communist guerrillas to fight the Tudeh Party if they seized power in the chaos of Operation Ajax. Released National Security Archive documents showed that Undersecretary of State Walter Bedell Smith reported that the CIA had agreed with Qashqai tribal leaders, in south Iran, to establish a clandestine safe haven from which U.S.-funded guerrillas and spies could operate.

The CIA sent Major General Norman Schwarzkopf Sr. to persuade the exiled Shah to return to rule Iran. Schwarzkopf trained the security forces that would become known as SAVAK to secure the shah&#x27;s hold on power.

According to a heavily redacted CIA document released to the National Security Archive in response to a Freedom of Information request, &quot;Available documents do not indicate who authorized CIA to begin planning the operation, but it almost certainly was President Eisenhower himself. Eisenhower biographer Stephen Ambrose has written that the absence of documentation reflected the President&#x27;s style.&quot;

The CIA document then quotes from the Ambrose biography of Eisenhower:
One version of the CIA history, written by Wilber, referred to the operation as TPAJAX.

A tactic Roosevelt admitted to using, was bribing demonstrators into attacking symbols of the Shah, while chanting pro-Mosaddegh slogans. As king, the Shah was largely seen as a symbol of Iran at the time by many Iranians and monarchists. Roosevelt declared that the more that these agents showed their hate for the Shah and attacked his symbols, the more it caused the average Iranian citizen to dislike and distrust Mosaddegh.

The British and American spy agencies strengthened the monarchy in Iran by backing the pro-western Shah for the next 26 years. The Shah was overthrown in 1979. Some Iranian clerics cooperated with the western spy agencies because they were dissatisfied with Mosaddegh&#x27;s secular government.

While the broad outlines of the operation are known, &quot;...the C.I.A.&#x27;s records were widely thought by historians to have the potential to add depth and clarity to a famous but little-documented intelligence operation&quot;, reporter Tim Weiner wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; 29 May 1997.

&quot;The Central Intelligence Agency, which has repeatedly pledged for more than five years to make public the files from its secret mission to overthrow the government of Iran in 1953, said today that it had destroyed or lost almost all the documents decades ago.&quot;

Donald Wilber, one of the CIA officers who planned the 1953 coup in Iran, wrote an account titled, &quot;Clandestine Service History Overthrow of Premier Mossadeq of Iran: November 1952 – August 1953&quot;. Wilber said one goal of the coup was to strengthen the Shah. In 2000, James Risen at &quot;The New York Times&quot; obtained the previously secret CIA version of the coup written by Wilber and summarized its contents, which includes the following:

In early August, the CIA increased the pressure. Iranian operatives pretending to be Communists threatened Muslim leaders with &quot;savage punishment if they opposed Mossadegh&quot;, seeking to stir anti-Communist sentiment in the religious community.

In addition, the secret history says, the house of at least one prominent Muslim was bombed by CIA agents posing as Communists. It does not say whether anyone was hurt in this attack.

The agency was intensifying its propaganda campaign. A leading newspaper owner was granted a personal loan of about $45,000, &quot;in the belief that this would make his organ amenable to our purposes.&quot;

The Shah remained intransigent. In a 1 August meeting with General Norman Schwarzkopf, he refused to sign the C.I.A.-written decrees firing Mr. Mossadegh and appointing General Zahedi. He said he doubted that the army would support him in a showdown.

The National Security Archive at George Washington University contains the full account by Wilber, along with many other coup-related documents and analysis.

===Release of U.S. government records and official acknowledgement===
In August 2013, on the 60th anniversary of the coup, the US government released documents showing they were involved in staging the coup. The documents also describe the motivations behind the coup and the strategies used to stage it. The UK had sought to censor information regarding its role in the coup; a significant number of documents about the coup remained classified. The release of the declassified documents, which marked the first US official acknowledgement of its role, was seen as a goodwill gesture on the part of the Obama administration. According to Aljazeera, the deputy director of the National Security Archive, Malcolm Byrne, disclosed that the CIA documented the secret histories purposely for official use.

Public awareness of American and British participation in Mosaddeq&#x27;s overthrow was long-standing. An internal narrative from the middle of the 1970s called &quot;The Battle for Iran&quot; makes a clear reference to the CIA&#x27;s involvement. In 1981, the agency made a highly edited version of the report public in reaction to an ACLU lawsuit, but it blocked out all mentions of TPAJAX, the code name for the American-led operation. These references can be found in the most recent release in 2013, which is thought to be the CIA&#x27;s first official admission that the agency assisted in the coup&#x27;s planning and execution.

In June 2017, the United States State Department&#x27;s Office of the Historian released its revised historical account of the event. The volume of historical records &quot;focuses on the evolution of U.S. thinking on Iran as well as the U.S. Government covert operation that resulted in Mosadeq&#x27;s overthrow on 19 August 1953&quot;. Though some of the relevant records were destroyed long ago, the release contains a collection of roughly 1,000 pages, only a small number of which remain classified. One revelation is that the CIA &quot;attempted to call off the failing coup but was salvaged by an insubordinate spy.&quot; The reports released by the U.S. had reached 1,007 pages, consisting of diplomatic cables and letters according to VOA News.

In March 2018, the National Security Archive released a declassified British memo alleging that the United States Embassy sent &quot;large sums of money&quot; to &quot;influential people&quot;—namely senior Iranian clerics—in the days leading up to Mosaddeq&#x27;s overthrow. According to the Guardian, despite the U.S. showing regrets about the coup, it has failed to officially issue an apology over its involvement.

===United States financial support===
The CIA paid a large sum to carry out the operation. Depending on the expenses to be counted, the final cost is estimated to vary from $100,000 to $20 million. CIA gave Zahedi&#x27;s government $5 million after the coup with Zahedi himself receiving an extra million.

===United States motives===
Historians disagree on what motivated the United States to change its policy towards Iran and stage the coup. Middle East historian Ervand Abrahamian identified the coup d&#x27;état as &quot;a classic case of nationalism clashing with imperialism in the Third World&quot;. He states that Secretary of State Dean Acheson admitted the Communist threat&#x27; was a smokescreen&quot; in responding to President Eisenhower&#x27;s claim that the Tudeh Party was about to assume power:

 Throughout the crisis, the &quot;communist danger&quot; was more of a rhetorical device than a real issue—i.e. it was part of the cold-war discourse ...The Tudeh was no match for the armed tribes and the 129,000-man military. What is more, the British and Americans had enough inside information to be confident that the party had no plans to initiate armed insurrection. At the beginning of the crisis, when the Truman administration was under the impression a compromise was possible, Acheson had stressed the communist danger, and warned if Mosaddegh was not helped, the Tudeh would take over. The (British) Foreign Office had retorted that the Tudeh was no real threat. But, in August 1953, when the Foreign Office echoed the Eisenhower administration&#x27;s claim that the Tudeh was about to take over, Acheson now retorted that there was no such communist danger. Acheson was honest enough to admit that the issue of the Tudeh was a smokescreen.

Abrahamian states that Iran&#x27;s oil was the central focus of the coup, for both the British and the Americans, though &quot;much of the discourse at the time linked it to the Cold War&quot;. Abrahamian wrote, &quot;If Mosaddegh had succeeded in nationalizing the British oil industry in Iran, that would have set an example and was seen at that time by the Americans as a threat to U.S. oil interests throughout the world, because other countries would do the same.&quot; Mosaddegh did not want any compromise solution that allowed a degree of foreign control. Abrahamian said that Mosaddegh &quot;wanted real nationalization, both in theory and practice&quot;.
Political theorist John Tirman points out that agricultural land owners were politically dominant in Iran well into the 1960s, and the monarch Reza Shah&#x27;s aggressive land expropriation policies—to the benefit of himself and his supporters—resulted in the Iranian government being Iran&#x27;s largest land owner. &quot;The landlords and oil producers had new backing, moreover, as American interests were for the first time exerted in Iran. The Cold War was starting, and Soviet challenges were seen in every leftist movement. But the reformers were at root nationalists, not communists, and the issue that galvanized them above all others was the control of oil.&quot; The belief that oil was the central motivator behind the coup has been echoed in the popular media by authors such as Robert Byrd, Alan Greenspan, and Ted Koppel.

Middle East political scientist Mark Gasiorowski states that while, on the face of it, there is considerable merit to the argument that U.S. policymakers helped U.S. oil companies gain a share in Iranian oil production after the coup, &quot;it seems more plausible to argue that U.S. policymakers were motivated mainly by fears of a communist takeover in Iran, and that the involvement of U.S. companies was sought mainly to prevent this from occurring. The Cold War was at its height in the early 1950s, and the Soviet Union was viewed as an expansionist power seeking world domination. Eisenhower had made the Soviet threat a key issue in the 1952 elections, accusing the Democrats of being soft on communism and of having &#x27;lost China.&#x27; Once in power, the new administration quickly sought to put its views into practice.&quot;

A 2019 study by Gasiorowski concluded &quot;that U.S. policymakers did not have compelling evidence that the threat of a Communist takeover was increasing substantially in the months before the coup. Rather, the Eisenhower administration interpreted the available evidence in a more alarming manner than the Truman administration had.&quot;

Gasiorowski further states &quot;the major U.S. oil companies were not interested in Iran at this time. A glut existed in the world oil market. The U.S. majors had increased their production in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in 1951 in order to make up for the loss of Iranian production; operating in Iran would force them to cut back production in these countries which would create tensions with Saudi and Kuwaiti leaders. Furthermore, if nationalist sentiments remained high in Iran, production there would be risky. U.S. oil companies had shown no interest in Iran in 1951 and 1952. By late 1952, the Truman administration had come to believe that participation by U.S. companies in the production of Iranian oil was essential to maintain stability in Iran and keep Iran out of Soviet hands. In order to gain the participation of the major U.S. oil companies, Truman offered to scale back a large anti-trust case then being brought against them. The Eisenhower administration shared Truman&#x27;s views on the participation of U.S. companies in Iran and also agreed to scale back the anti-trust case. Thus, not only did U.S. majors not want to participate in Iran at this time, it took a major effort by U.S. policymakers to persuade them to become involved.&quot;

In 2004, Gasiorowski edited a book on the coup arguing that &quot;the climate of intense cold war rivalry between the superpowers, together with Iran&#x27;s strategic vital location between the Soviet Union and the Persian Gulf oil fields, led U.S. officials to believe that they had to take whatever steps were necessary to prevent Iran from falling into Soviet hands.&quot; While &quot;these concerns seem vastly overblown today&quot; the pattern of &quot;the 1945–46 Azerbaijan crisis, the consolidation of Soviet control in Eastern Europe, the communist triumph in China, and the Korean War—and with the Red Scare at its height in the United States&quot; would not allow U.S. officials to risk allowing the Tudeh Party to gain power in Iran. Furthermore, &quot;U.S. officials believed that resolving the oil dispute was essential for restoring stability in Iran, and after March 1953 it appeared that the dispute could be resolved only at the expense either of Britain or of Mosaddeq.&quot; He concludes &quot;it was geostrategic considerations, rather than a desire to destroy Mosaddeq&#x27;s movement, to establish a dictatorship in Iran or to gain control over Iran&#x27;s oil, that persuaded U.S. officials to undertake the coup.&quot; Faced with choosing between British interests and Iran, the U.S. chose Britain, Gasiorowski said. &quot;Britain was the closest ally of the United States, and the two countries were working as partners on a wide range of vitally important matters throughout the world at this time. Preserving this close relationship was more important to U.S. officials than saving Mosaddeq&#x27;s tottering regime.&quot; A year earlier, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill used Britain&#x27;s support for the U.S. in the Cold War to insist the United States not undermine his campaign to isolate Mosaddegh. &quot;Britain was supporting the Americans in Korea, he reminded Truman, and had a right to expect &#x27;Anglo-American unity&#x27; on Iran.&quot;

According to Kinzer, for most Americans, the crisis in Iran became just part of the conflict between Communism and &quot;the Free world&quot;. &quot;A great sense of fear, particularly the fear of encirclement, shaped American consciousness during this period. ... Soviet power had already subdued Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. Communist governments were imposed on Bulgaria and Romania in 1946, Hungary and Poland in 1947, and Czechoslovakia in 1948. Albania and Yugoslavia also turned to communism. Greek communists made a violent bid for power. Soviet soldiers blocked land routes to Berlin for sixteen months. In 1949, the Soviet Union successfully tested a nuclear weapon. That same year, pro-Western forces in China lost their Civil War to communists led by Mao Zedong. From Washington, it seemed that enemies were on the march everywhere.&quot; Consequently, &quot;the United States, challenged by what most Americans saw as a relentless communist advance, slowly ceased to view Iran as a country with a unique history that faced a unique political challenge.&quot; Some historians, including Douglas Little, Abbas Milani and George Lenczowski have echoed the view that fears of a communist takeover or Soviet influence motivated the U.S. to intervene.

On 11 May 1951, prior to the overthrow of Mosaddegh, Adolf A. Berle warned the U.S. State Department that U.S. &quot;control of the Middle East was at stake, which, with its Persian Gulf oil, meant &#x27;substantial control of the world.&#x27;&quot;

===News coverage in the United States and the United Kingdom===
When Mosaddegh called for the dissolution of the Majlis in August 1953, the editors of the &quot;New York Times&quot; gave the opinion that: &quot;A plebiscite more fantastic and farcical than any ever held under Hitler or Stalin is now being staged in Iran by Premier Mosaddegh in an effort to make himself unchallenged dictator of the country.&quot;

A year after the coup, the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote on 6 August 1954, that a new oil &quot;agreement between Iran and a consortium of foreign oil companies&quot; was &quot;good news indeed&quot;:

Costly as the dispute over Iranian oil has been to all concerned, the affair may yet be proved worthwhile if lessons are learned from it: Underdeveloped countries with rich resources now have an object lesson in the heavy cost that must be paid by one of their number which goes berserk with fanatical nationalism. It is perhaps too much to hope that Iran&#x27;s experience will prevent the rise of Mossadeghs in other countries, but that experience may at least strengthen the hands of more reasonable and more far-seeing leaders. In some circles in Great Britain the charge will be pushed that American &quot;imperialism&quot;—in the shape of the American oil firms in the consortium!—has once again elbowed Britain from a historic stronghold.

The documentary &quot;Cinematograph&quot; aired on 18 August 2011 on the anniversary of the coup. In it, BBC admitted for the first time to the role of BBC Persian radio as the propaganda arm of the British government in Iran. The &quot;Cinematograph&quot; narrator said:
The documentary quoted a 21 July 1951 classified document in which a Foreign Office official thanked the British ambassador for his proposals that were precisely followed by the BBC Persian radio to strengthen its propaganda against Mosaddegh:

The BBC was at times even used directly in the operations, sending coded messages to the coup plotters by changing the wording of its broadcasts.

An early account of the CIA&#x27;s role in the coup appeared in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in late 1954, purporting to explain how &quot;the strategic little nation of Iran was rescued from the closing clutch of Moscow.&quot; The report was approved by the CIA, and its authors may have been assisted by Kermit Roosevelt Jr., who had written for the &quot;Post&quot; before.

==Britain&#x27;s role==
Despite the British government&#x27;s pressure, the National Security Archive released two declassified documents in August 2017 which confirm the British solicitation of the United States&#x27; assistance in ousting Mosaddegh. According to these records, the British first approached the American government about a plan for the coup in November 1952 &quot;repeatedly&quot; asking U.S. to join the coup, claiming that the Mosaddegh government would be ineffective in preventing a communist takeover, and that Mosaddegh was a threat to America&#x27;s global fight against communism, which they believed necessitated action; the records also state that UK and U.S. spy agencies had by then had &quot;very tentative and preliminary discussions regarding the practicability of such a move&quot;. At the time, the American government was already preparing to aid Mosaddegh in his oil dealings with the British, and believed him to be anti-communist—considerations which made the U.S. government skeptical of the plot. Since President Truman&#x27;s term was drawing to a close in January 1953, and there was too much uncertainty and danger associated with the plot, the U.S. government decided not to take action against Mosaddegh at the time.

According to the 1952 documents, it was Christopher Steel, the No 2 official in the British embassy in Washington, who &quot;pitched&quot; the idea of the coup to US officials amid the US-Britain talks which had begun in October. The document also says that the British officials rejected Paul Nitze&#x27;s suggestion that, instead of executing a coup, they mount a &quot;campaign&quot; against Ayatollah Abolqasem Kashani, &quot;a leading opponent of British involvement in Iran&#x27;s oil industry&quot;, and the communist Tudeh Party. They &quot;pressed US for a decision&quot; since they knew &quot;the Truman administration was in its final weeks&quot;. According to Wilber, the British Secret Intelligence Service worked with CIA to form a propaganda campaign via &quot;the press, handbills and the Tehran clergy&quot; to &quot;weaken the Mossadeq government in any way possible&quot;.

More broadly, the oil nationalization law led to a direct conflict of interests between Mosaddegh and the British government, and the latter internally proposed to regain its control over the oil industry in Iran by following a &quot;three-track strategy&quot; aimed at either &quot;pressuring him into a favorable settlement or by removing him from the office.&quot; The three components of Britain&#x27;s strategy consisted of (1) refusing direct negotiation with Mosaddegh, (2) imposing economic sanctions on Iran and performing war games in the region, and (3) the removal of Mosaddegh through &quot;covert political action&quot;.

In the lead-up to the 70th anniversary of the coup in August 2023, David Owen, who was the UK Foreign Secretary in the late 1970s, said that MI6 should follow the example of the CIA and acknowledge its role in the coup.

==Clergy&#x27;s role==
Mosaddegh appointed a series of secular ministers to his cabinet during his premiership, losing his support with the clergy. In 1953, Ayatollah Abol-Qasem Kashani and his followers organised a series of protests against Mosaddegh&#x27;s liberal reforms. By July 1953 when Mosaddegh asked for a critical extension of his emergency powers, &quot;... Clerical members of the Majles who supported Kashani left the National Front Coalition and set up their own Islamic Faction...&quot;. (Muslim Warriors). This faction then boycotted the 1953 referendum about the dissolution of parliament.

At 8am on 18 August Ayatollah Behbahan mobilised 3000 stick and club wielding anti-shah protestors formed a mob in Tehran. This was done in the hope that the removal of Mosaddegh would create a more religious government. Separate mobilisation was instigated by Ayatollah Kashani in the country at this time. There has been documentation that both Ayatollah Behbahani and Kashani received funds from the CIA by some sources. The former&#x27;s mob would lead Mosaddegh to abandon his residence, and ultimately his capture. Iranian Historian Michael Axworthy stated that &quot;... [The clergy&#x27;s] move to oppose Mossadeq was the decisive factor in his downfall...&quot;.

==Aftermath==
The coup has been said to have &quot;left a profound and long-lasting legacy.&quot;

===Blowback===
The coup caused long-lasting damage to the U.S. reputation, according to documents released to the National Security Archive and reflected in the book &quot;Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran:&quot;
The &#x27;28 Mordad&#x27; coup, as it is known by its Persian date [in the Solar Hijri calendar], was a watershed for Iran, for the Middle East and for the standing of the United States in the region. The joint US-British operation ended Iran&#x27;s drive to assert sovereign control over its own resources and helped put an end to a vibrant chapter in the history of the country&#x27;s nationalist and democratic movements. These consequences resonated with dramatic effect in later years. When the Shah finally fell in 1979, memories of the US intervention in 1953, which made possible the monarch&#x27;s subsequent, and increasingly unpopular, 25-year reign intensified the anti-American character of the revolution in the minds of many Iranians.

The authoritarian monarch appreciated the coup, Kermit Roosevelt wrote in his account of the affair. &quot;&#x27;I owe my throne to God, my people, my army and to you!&#x27; By &#x27;you&#x27; he [the shah] meant me and the two countries—Great Britain and the United States—I was representing. We were all heroes.&quot;

On 16 June 2000, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published the secret CIA report, &quot;Clandestine Service History, Overthrow of Premier Mossadeq of Iran, November 1952 – August 1953&quot;, partly explaining the coup from CIA agent Wilber&#x27;s perspective. In a related story, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter James Risen penned a story revealing that Wilber&#x27;s report, hidden for nearly five decades, had recently come to light.

In the summer of 2001, Ervand Abrahamian writes in the journal &quot;Science &amp; Society&quot; that Wilber&#x27;s version of the coup was missing key information some of which was available elsewhere:

 &quot;The New York Times&quot; recently leaked a CIA report on the 1953 American-British overthrow of Mosaddeq, Iran&#x27;s Prime Minister. It billed the report as a secret history of the secret coup, and treated it as an invaluable substitute for the U.S. files that remain inaccessible. But a reconstruction of the coup from other sources, especially from the archives of the British Foreign Office, indicates that this report is highly sanitized. It glosses over such sensitive issues as the crucial participation of the U.S. ambassador in the actual overthrow; the role of U.S. military advisers; the harnessing of local Nazis and Muslim terrorists; and the use of assassinations to destabilize the government. What is more, it places the coup in the context of the Cold War rather than that of the Anglo-Iranian oil crisis—a classic case of nationalism clashing with imperialism in the Third World.

In a review of Tim Weiner&#x27;s &quot;Legacy of Ashes&quot;, historian Michael Beschloss wrote, &quot;Mr. Weiner argues that a bad C.I.A. track record has encouraged many of our gravest contemporary problems... A generation of Iranians grew up knowing that the C.I.A. had installed the shah&quot;, Mr. Weiner notes. &quot;In time, the chaos that the agency had created in the streets of Tehran would return to haunt the United States.&quot;

The administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower considered the coup a success, but, given its blowback, that opinion is no longer generally held, because of its &quot;haunting and terrible legacy&quot;. In 2000, Madeleine Albright, U.S. Secretary of State, said that intervention by the U.S. in the internal affairs of Iran was a setback for democratic government. The coup is widely believed to have significantly contributed to the 1979 Iranian Revolution, which deposed the &quot;pro-Western&quot; Shah and replaced the monarchy with an &quot;anti-Western&quot; Islamic republic.
* According to U.S. President Obama. &quot;For many Iranians, the coup demonstrated duplicity by the United States, which presented itself as a defender of freedom but did not hesitate to use underhanded methods to overthrow a democratically elected government to suit its own economic and strategic interests&quot;, the Agence France-Presse reported.

United States Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, who visited Iran both before and after the coup, wrote that &quot;When Mosaddegh and Persia started basic reforms, we became alarmed. We united with the British to destroy him; we succeeded; and ever since, our name has not been an honored one in the Middle East.&quot;

===Iran===

====Perceptions of the Shah====
When the Shah returned to Iran after the coup, he was greeted by a cheering crowd. He wrote in his memoirs that while he had been a king for over a decade, for the first time he felt that the people had &quot;elected&quot; and &quot;approved&quot; of him, and that he had a &quot;legitimate&quot; popular mandate to carry out his reforms (although some in the crowd may have been bribed). The Shah was never able to remove the reputation of being a &quot;foreign imposed&quot; ruler among non-royalist Iranians. The Shah throughout his rule continued to assume that he was supported by virtually everybody in Iran, and sank into deep dejection when in 1978 massive mobs demanded his ouster. The incident left him in awe of American power, while it also gave him a deep hatred of the British.

====Bloody suppression of the opposition====
An immediate consequence of the coup d&#x27;état was the Shah&#x27;s suppression of all republicanist political dissent, especially the liberal and nationalist opposition umbrella group National Front as well as the communist Tudeh Party, and concentration of political power in the Shah and his courtiers.

The minister of Foreign Affairs and the closest associate of Mosaddegh, Hossein Fatemi, was executed by order of the Shah&#x27;s military court by firing squad on 10 November 1954. According to Kinzer, &quot;The triumphant Shah [Pahlavi] ordered the execution of several dozen military officers and student leaders who had been closely associated with Mohammad Mosaddegh&quot;.

As part of the post-coup d&#x27;état political repression between 1953 and 1958, the Shah outlawed the National Front, and arrested most of its leaders. The Shah personally spared Mosaddegh the death penalty, and he was given 3 years in prison, followed by house arrest for life.

Many supporters of Iran continued to fight against the new regime, yet they were suppressed with some even being killed. The political party that Mosaddegh founded, the National Front of Iran, was later reorganized by Karim Sanjabi, and is currently being led by the National Poet of Iran Adib Boroumand, who was a strong Mosaddegh supporter and helped spread pro-Mosaddegh propaganda during the Abadan Crisis and its aftermath.

The Communist Tudeh bore the main brunt of the crackdown. The Shah&#x27;s security forces arrested 4,121 Tudeh political activists including 386 civil servants, 201 college students, 165 teachers, 125 skilled workers, 80 textile workers, and 60 cobblers. Forty were executed (primarily for murder, such as Khosrow Roozbeh), another 14 died under torture and over 200 were sentenced to life imprisonment. The Shah&#x27;s post-coup dragnet also captured 477 Tudeh members (&quot;22 colonels, 69 majors, 100 captains, 193 lieutenants, 19 noncommissioned officers, and 63 military cadets&quot;) who were in the Iranian armed forces. After their presence was revealed, some National Front supporters complained that this Communist Tudeh military network could have saved Mosaddegh. However, few Tudeh officers commanded powerful field units, especially tank divisions that might have countered the coup. Most of the captured Tudeh officers came from the military academies, police and medical corps. At least eleven of the captured army officers were tortured to death between 1953 and 1958.

====Creation of a secret police====

After the 1953 coup, the Shah&#x27;s government formed the SAVAK (secret police), many of whose agents were trained in the United States. The SAVAK monitored dissidents and carried out censorship. After the 1971 Siahkal Incident, it was given a &quot;loose leash&quot; to torture suspected dissidents with &quot;brute force&quot; that, over the years, &quot;increased dramatically&quot;, and nearly 100 people were executed for political reasons during the last 20 years of the Shah&#x27;s rule. After the revolution, SAVAK was officially abolished, but was in reality &quot;drastically expanded&quot; into a new organization that killed over 8,000–12,000 prisoners between 1981 and 1985 alone, and 20,000–30,000 in total, with one prisoner who served time under both the Shah and the Islamic Republic declaring that &quot;four months under (Islamic Republic&#x27;s) warden Asadollah Lajevardi took the toll of four years under SAVAK&quot;.

====Oil policy====
Another effect was sharp improvement of Iran&#x27;s economy; the British-led oil embargo against Iran ended, and oil revenue increased significantly beyond the pre-nationalisation level. Despite Iran not controlling its national oil, the Shah agreed to replacing the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company with a consortium—British Petroleum and eight European and American oil companies; in result, oil revenues increased from $34 million in 1954–1955 to $181 million in 1956–1957, and continued increasing, and the United States sent development aid and advisers. The Shah&#x27;s government attempted to solve the issue of oil nationalization through this method, and Iran began to develop rapidly under his rule. The Shah later in his memoirs declared that Mosaddegh was a &quot;dictator&quot; who was &quot;damaging&quot; Iran through his &quot;stubbornness&quot;, while he (the Shah) &quot;followed&quot; the smarter option. By the 1970s, Iran was wealthier than all of its surrounding neighbors, and economists frequently predicted that it would become a major global economic power, and a developed country.

When the Shah attempted during the 1970s to once again control the oil prices (through OPEC), and cancel the same oil consortium agreement that caused the 1953 coup, it resulted in a massive decline in US support for the Shah, and ironically, hastened his downfall.

CIA staff historian David Robarge stated: &quot;The CIA carried out [a] successful regime change operation. It also transformed a turbulent constitutional monarchy into an absolutist kingship and induced a succession of unintended consequences.&quot; The 1979 Iranian Revolution was a most impactful unintended consequence.

===Internationally===
Kinzer wrote that the 1953 coup d&#x27;état was the first time the United States used the CIA to overthrow a democratically elected, civil government. The Eisenhower administration viewed Operation Ajax as a success, with &quot;immediate and far-reaching effect. Overnight, the CIA became a central part of the American foreign policy apparatus, and covert action came to be regarded as a cheap and effective way to shape the course of world events&quot;—a coup engineered by the CIA called Operation PBSuccess toppling the duly elected Guatemalan government of Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán, which had nationalised farm land owned by the United Fruit Company, followed the next year.

A pro-American government in Iran extended the United States&#x27; geographic and strategic advantage in the Middle East, as Turkey, also bordering the USSR, was part of NATO.

In 2000, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, acknowledged the coup&#x27;s pivotal role in the troubled relationship and &quot;came closer to apologizing than any American official ever has before&quot;:

The Eisenhower administration believed its actions were justified for strategic reasons. ... But the coup was clearly a setback for Iran&#x27;s political development. And it is easy to see now why many Iranians continue to resent this intervention by America in their internal affairs.

In June 2009, the U.S. President Barack Obama in a speech in Cairo, Egypt, talked about the United States&#x27; relationship with Iran, mentioning the role of the U.S. in 1953 Iranian coup saying:

==Legacy==
In the Islamic Republic, remembrance of the coup is quite different from that of history books published in the West, and follows the precepts of Ayatollah Khomeini that Islamic jurists must guide the country to prevent &quot;the influence of foreign powers&quot;. Kashani came out against Mosaddegh by mid-1953 and &quot;told a foreign correspondent that Mosaddegh had fallen because he had forgotten that the shah enjoyed extensive popular support.&quot; A month later, Kashani &quot;went even further and declared that Mosaddegh deserved to be executed because he had committed the ultimate offense: rebelling against the shah, &#x27;betraying&#x27; the country, and repeatedly violating the sacred law.&quot;

Men associated with Mosaddegh and his ideals dominated Iran&#x27;s first post-revolutionary government. The first prime minister after the Iranian revolution was Mehdi Bazargan, a close associate of Mosaddegh. But with the subsequent rift between the conservative Islamic establishment and the secular liberal forces, Mosaddegh&#x27;s work and legacy has been largely ignored by the Islamic Republic establishment. However, Mosaddegh remains a popular historical figure among Iranian opposition factions. Mosaddegh&#x27;s image is one of the symbols of Iran&#x27;s opposition movement, also known as the Green Movement. Kinzer writes that Mosaddegh &quot;for most Iranians&quot; is &quot;the most vivid symbol of Iran&#x27;s long struggle for democracy&quot; and that modern protesters carrying a picture of Mosaddegh is the equivalent of saying &quot;We want democracy&quot; and &quot;No foreign intervention&quot;.

In the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kinzer&#x27;s book &quot;All the Shah&#x27;s Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror&quot; has been censored of descriptions of Ayatollah Abol-Ghasem Kashani&#x27;s activities during the Anglo-American coup d&#x27;état. Mahmood Kashani, the son of Abol-Ghasem Kashani, &quot;one of the top members of the current, ruling élite&quot; whom the Iranian Council of Guardians has twice approved to run for the presidency, denies there was a coup d&#x27;état in 1953, saying Mosaddegh was obeying British plans to undermine the role of Shia clerics.

This allegation also is posited in the book &quot;Khaterat-e Arteshbod-e Baznesheshteh Hossein Fardoust&quot; (The Memoirs of Retired General Hossein Fardoust), published in the Islamic Republic and allegedly written by Hossein Fardoust, a former SAVAK officer. It says that rather than being a mortal enemy of the British, Mohammad Mosaddegh always favored them, and his nationalisation campaign of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was inspired by &quot;the British themselves&quot;. Scholar Ervand Abrahamian suggests that the fact that Fardoust&#x27;s death was announced before publication of the book may be significant, as the Islamic Republic authorities may have forced him into writing such statements under duress.

==Viewpoints==

Ruhollah Khomeini said the government did not pay enough attention to religious figures which caused the coup d&#x27;état to take place and described the separation between religion and politics as a fault in contemporary history.

Ali Khamenei believed that Mosaddegh trusted the United States and asked them to help confront Britain.

==In popular culture==
Directed by Hasan Fathi and written jointly with playwright and university professor Naghmeh Samini, the TV series &quot;Shahrzad&quot; is the story of a love broken apart by events in the aftermath of the 1953 coup that overthrew the democratically elected prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh.

Cognito Comics/Verso Books has published a nonfiction graphic novel of the history, &quot;Operation AJAX: The Story of the CIA Coup That Remade The Middle East&quot;, that covers events leading to how the CIA hired rival mobs to create chaos and overthrow the country.

<text>Louisa Catherine Adams (; February 12, 1775 – May 15, 1852) was the first lady of the United States from 1825 to 1829 during the presidency of John Quincy Adams.

She was born in England and raised in France. Her father was an influential American merchant, and she was regularly introduced to prominent Americans. After her family returned to England, she met John Quincy Adams in 1795, and the two began a tenuous courtship. They married in 1797 after being engaged for a year, beginning a marriage of disagreements and personality conflicts. She joined her husband on his diplomatic mission to Prussia, where she was popular with the Prussian court. When they returned to the United States, her husband became a senator and she gave birth to three sons. John was appointed minister to the Russian Empire in 1809, and they traveled to Russia without their two older sons, against Louisa&#x27;s wishes. Though she was again popular with the court, she detested living in Russia, especially after the death of her infant daughter in 1812. She lived in Russia alone for a year while John negotiated the Treaty of Ghent, and when he asked her to join him in 1815, she made the dangerous 40-day journey across war-torn Europe.

The Adamses lived in England for two years before returning to the United States when John was appointed Secretary of State. Louisa became a prominent cabinet wife and regularly hosted important guests in her home. She worked to build connections for her husband&#x27;s 1824 presidential run, allowing for his victory. She was unsatisfied in the White House, where she became reclusive and grew distant from her husband. She instead took to writing, producing plays, essays, poems, and an autobiography. She wished for retirement after her husband lost re-election, but he was elected to the United States House of Representatives. She took a more active interest in politics, supporting abolitionism and greater rights for women in society. She was widowed in 1848, and she had a stroke in 1849 that left her with limited mobility. She died on May 15, 1852, at the age of 77, and Congress adjourned for her funeral, the first time a woman was honored in this way.

She was the only foreign-born first lady of the United States until 2017, when Melania Trump became first lady. Her tenure as first lady is not as well studied as other parts of her life, due to her reclusiveness and the limited records she kept at the time. Still, she is generally rated in the upper half of first ladies by historians.

==Early life (1775–1788)==
Louisa Catherine Johnson was born in London on February 12, 1775. She was the second daughter of American merchant Joshua Johnson and Englishwoman Catherine Nuth. The Johnsons were an influential family in American politics, with Louisa&#x27;s paternal uncle Thomas Johnson being one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. Little is known of her mother&#x27;s life prior to her marriage. Louisa&#x27;s parents may have only married ten years after her birth, potentially making Louisa the only first lady of the United States to be born out of wedlock. She lived a comfortable life as a child in which all of her needs were seen to.

Louisa&#x27;s father supported American independence, and the Johnsons left England in 1778 in response to the American Revolutionary War. They moved to Nantes, France, where they lived for the next five years. While in France, Louisa attended a Catholic boarding school. She performed well in school, becoming proficient in music and literature, and she learned to speak French fluently. She also practiced Catholicism. Such was her immersion in French that she was later forced to relearn English. She was also versed in Greek and Latin. The Johnsons lived in luxury, even when they did not have the financial means to do so. Their home in France was a mansion that came to be known as &quot;The Temple of Taste&quot;.

The Johnsons returned to England and settled in Tower Hill, while Louisa was placed in a London boarding school. She was teased for her French mannerisms, and the Catholicism that she had learned in France caused conflict with her Anglican religious education in England. Her self-esteem suffered, and she kept a distance from her peers. She was sent to be educated by John Hewlett, an Anglican minister and a family friend of the Johnsons. Hewlett became a strong influence on her upbringing, encouraging her intellectualism. The Johnsons suffered financially in 1788, and she was pulled out of school to be educated by a governess.

==Marriage (1790–1797)==

Johnson&#x27;s father was appointed the American consul to Great Britain in 1790, and she often assisted in entertaining prominent guests. Among these guests, the Johnson daughters looked for potential suitors, as they were pressured to marry a prominent young man. John Quincy Adams became one such guest in 1795 in his capacity as an American diplomat. He began showing up each day, and only later did the Johnsons realize that he intended to court Louisa, initially believing that his interest was in her older sister Nancy. Only after he complied with a joking request to write her a romantic poem did she consider him a potential suitor.

Johnson and Adams began a courtship, though it was intermittent, and they did not immediately take to one another. Both had previously expressed interest in other potential partners. It was their talents and prestige that eventually drew them to one another. Adams in particular was taken by Johnson&#x27;s aptitude for singing and music. This pairing also caused a rivalry between Louisa and her older sister, who was jealous for the man she thought would court her.

Johnson and Adams were engaged by 1796, but Adams left England for work and provided a number of excuses as to why he felt they should not be wed, citing his work, his finances, and their personality conflicts. Another factor was the disapproval of his mother, Abigail Adams, who did not wish to see her son marry an Englishwoman. They communicated by letter over the following year, and Johnson came to dread their communications, as Adams&#x27;s letters were humorless and chastising. Louisa and John eventually married on July 26, 1797, after pressuring from her father. Shortly after the marriage, the Johnsons lost the remainder of their fortune. Louisa&#x27;s parents fled the country, leaving Louisa and John with little financial support and a mob of angry creditors. The couple disagreed about how much influence a wife should have in her family, and John often made major decisions without consulting her. Both had strong personalities, and their disagreements often became arguments.

== Diplomat&#x27;s wife (1797–1825) ==

=== Prussia ===
John was appointed American minister to Prussia in 1797, and the couple moved to Berlin. Louisa experienced several miscarriages over the following years, causing poor health that further strained her relationship with her husband. She eventually gave birth to their first child, George Washington Adams, in 1801. She took a prominent role in diplomatic proceedings when she was not ill from pregnancy, and she was popular among the Prussian aristocracy, personally befriending the king and queen. John was recalled from Berlin by his father after Thomas Jefferson was elected president, and the family left Prussia for the United States.

=== United States ===
Adams reunited with her family after arriving in the United States in 1801 while her husband went to his own family home in Quincy, Massachusetts. The journey from Washington to Quincy was interrupted by an uncomfortable dinner with the Jefferson family at the White House and a visit to Martha Washington at Mount Vernon, but it was otherwise long and punishing. Reluctantly, she arrived in Quincy to meet her parents-in-law. While she quickly took to her father-in-law, her mother-in-law remained skeptical of her suitability as a wife.

Adams&#x27;s father Joshua died in 1802, severely affecting her and leaving the family with no financial support. When her husband was elected to the United States Senate in 1803, she joined him in alternating between Massachusetts and Washington, D.C., much preferring the latter. Unable to afford a home of their own, the family stayed with John&#x27;s relatives in Massachusetts and with Louisa&#x27;s relatives in Washington. She gave birth to John Adams II in 1803. She was often left behind while her husband traveled on his own, which she deeply resented. On one such occasion, she suffered a miscarriage. Their third son, Charles Francis Adams, was born in 1807. Her husband resigned from the Senate in 1808, having come in disagreement with the Federalist Party over matters of policy. This disagreement was seen as a betrayal, and the family was thereby excluded from Boston social life.

=== Russia ===
When John accepted the position as American minister to Russia in 1809, he did not consult Louisa. He determined that she would accompany him and that their two older sons would stay behind in the United States. She came to regret these arrangements, feeling that she had failed her sons by leaving them. She blamed and resented her husband for this, causing a rift in their marriage. The 80 day journey to Russia proved unpleasant, and they were constantly wary of French ships that were at war with Russia. Her opinion did not change after arriving in Saint Petersburg, which she found disagreeable, but her husband ignored her desires to return to the United States.

Just as she did in Berlin, Louisa impressed the Russian court and received special attention from the monarch. Unable to afford the elaborate outfits expected of Russian courtiers, she came up with excuses to avoid frequent appearances, first feigning illness and then feigning mourning so that her less formal clothes could be excused. Despite her success, Louisa was unhappy during her time in Russia, as she was separated from her family, regularly ill, and forced to contend with loss. After suffering another three miscarriages, Louisa gave birth in 1811 to her first daughter, and the first American born in Russia, Louisa Catherine Adams II. A year later, the infant died of dysentery, causing Louisa further grief and increasing her resentment against her husband.

When John was called to Ghent in 1814 to negotiate a peace agreement for the War of 1812, Louisa was left in Saint Petersburg, where she would remain for the next year. John learned to afford her a greater level of trust and responsibility while living in Russia, and in December 1814, he tasked her with selling their property in Russia and traveling across Europe to meet him in Paris. She left in February 1815, and for the next 40 days she made the dangerous journey across Europe, which had been ravaged by the Napoleonic Wars, in the cold winter. She was frequently in danger of bandits, and later of French soldiers hostile to her Russian carriage. John and his parents gave Louisa a greater deal of respect after she completed the journey.

=== Return to London and Washington ===

Louisa and John returned to London in 1815, as John had been appointed minister to Great Britain. Their children were sent to London as well, and the family lived there reunited for the following two years. Louisa lived more comfortably in London than she had elsewhere; the diplomatic responsibilities were lighter, and she had regular access to an Anglican church. She took on more responsibility in managing the family and assisting her husband in his work, particularly after he suffered a painful eye infection that left him temporarily blinded and an injury to his hand that left him unable to write.

The family returned to the United States when John was appointed Secretary of State in 1817. Louisa found the social politics of Washington distasteful, and she felt that John was too good for it. Despite this, she worked to build political connections for her husband in Washington, hosting a party each Tuesday regularly visiting the wives of influential congressmen. Instead of navigating the complex social rules that had developed in Washington since they last lived there, the Adamses ignored the expectation that they defer to members of Congress in the social hierarchy by calling on them first. The resulting dispute grew to the point that it was addressed by the presidential cabinet. Louisa&#x27;s relationship with John struggled as he became increasingly occupied by his work, but she finally earned her mother-in-law&#x27;s respect after returning to the United States, and they shared a friendly reunion. Their close relationship was short-lived, however, as Abigail died in 1818.

As first lady Elizabeth Monroe did not engage in social activity, the responsibility fell to the Adams household to be the social hub of the capital. Louisa&#x27;s most celebrated accomplishment in this role was the ball that she threw for Andrew Jackson in January 1824, which came to be recognized as one of the city&#x27;s grandest social events. As John sought the presidency in the 1824 presidential election, Louisa effectively managed his campaign and worked beside him as an equal partner. When the election failed to produce a winner and the result was determined by the House of Representatives, John was chosen through what was criticized as a corrupt bargain, and Louisa shared the criticism that he faced.

==First lady of the United States (1825–1829)==

Upon entering the White House, life became more difficult for the Adamses. The administration was unpopular in Congress and unable to advance many of its policies, invoking a bitterness in John that was often directed toward Louisa. The couple again grew distant as they were affected by the stress of their positions. During vacations, they traveled separately and went long periods of time without seeing one another. Even when separated, they rarely wrote to one another, and the communications they did share were emotionless. Louisa suffered from loneliness while in the White House, which she did not consider a home.

The White House itself was in poor condition when Louisa and John occupied it, as it had never been fully restored after the burning of Washington. Despite this, they were criticized for what the public saw as an opulent residence. Louisa responded to the criticism by holding a public exhibition of the home, which was then criticized as distasteful. Louisa herself became a target in political rhetoric against John, in which she was portrayed as an out of touch European that demanded to be treated as an aristocrat. In response, she published a biography of herself that emphasized her modesty and her American heritage. Though it was published anonymously, she was understood to be the author. It was unprecedented for a first lady, and she was only subjected to increased criticism for the act.

Louisa had always been vulnerable to illness, but her health worsened during her years in the White House, and she was left bedridden on multiple occasions. Even she acknowledged a psychosomatic aspect to her illness. She became less visible as first lady, and even when she did entertain, she often did not attend her own events. She had faced criticism for being more prominent than was expected of a political wife. Instead, she hid from the public, writing plays, poems, essays, and an autobiography. These writings often contemplated the role of women in society as she lamented gender inequality.

Louisa was responsible for making arrangements when Lafayette visited the White House. Louisa&#x27;s greatest responsibility as first lady came upon the deaths of former presidents John Adams and Thomas Jefferson on July 4, 1826. With the president traveling and Congress in recess, it fell to her to set the social rules for mourning in Washington. She also mourned privately, as she had considered her father-in-law to be a father of her own. Against her husband&#x27;s wishes, she left the White House and traveled to the Adams family home in Quincy Louisa and John reconciled toward the end of the presidential term in 1828. She again worked to campaign for her husband during the 1828 presidential election, traveling to neighboring states to garner support. She was conflicted, as she was determined to get her husband re-elected, but she also loathed White House life. Louisa and John shared a mixture of despondence and relief when he lost re-election.

==Later life (1829–1852)==
After leaving the White House in 1829, Louisa and John moved to a home at Meridian Hill. Though the White House was still visible from her doorstep, she felt free from the place. Her reprieve was short-lived, as shortly after she left the White House, her son George fell from a steamboat to his death. He had suffered from extensive personal and financial problems, and it was never conclusively determined whether his death was an accident or a suicide. For the first few months after her son&#x27;s death, Louisa&#x27;s focus was on consoling her husband. Her grief overpowered her that August, when a trip to Quincy threatened to take her on the very boat from which George had died. She fell severely ill, and the trip was canceled.

In May 1830, Louisa and John moved to the home on the Adams estate in Quincy. Here her condition improved, as she found a home and the mental and physical toll of her depression subsided. She was upset by John&#x27;s return to public life when he ran for Congress that year, at first refusing to return to Washington and only giving in after it became apparent that the home in Quincy was not habitable in the winter. She confessed her belief that having her husband in Congress would be a benefit to the country that outweighed her own suffering. After John took office, Louisa took an active role in his political career. Louisa&#x27;s son John Adams II died of illness in 1834 with financial problems of his own. She blamed her husband in part for the failures and deaths of their two older sons, believing that they could have been given better lives had they not been separated from their parents in their childhood. In her grief, Louisa began writing a new autobiography, &quot;The Adventures of a Nobody&quot;. Two years later, in improved spirits, she wrote another autobiography covering her journey from Russia to France in 1815, hoping that it would inspire other women.

Though she shared society&#x27;s dismissive attitudes toward black people, she became an abolitionist, and she supported her husband in his anti-slavery work in Congress. Her position on the matter was even stronger than her husband&#x27;s, who had aligned with the abolitionists primarily because of his principled opposition to the gag rule against discussing slavery in Congress. Louisa contributed to a fund to free slaves, and she eventually purchased a slave for the purpose of freeing her. Involvement in the abolitionist movement also opened her to feminism. Though she did not accept feminism in its entirety, she began a correspondence with feminist Sarah Moore Grimké and engaged in Biblical studies to challenge the prevailing view that the Bible ordained the subservience of women. She was baptized in the Episcopal Church in 1837.

Louisa was widowed on February 23, 1848, two days after her husband lost consciousness due to a fatal stroke in the United States Capitol. He was 80 years old. She had arrived in Washington to visit him on his deathbed, but as a woman, she was asked to leave as his health failed. She retained her schedule of living in Washington during the winters and Quincy during the summers until a stroke left her infirm in 1849. She was then left in the care of her daughter-in-law Mary. She died on May 15, 1852 at the age of 77. She was the first woman to be honored by an adjournment of Congress for her funeral. She was buried in the Congressional Cemetery, but she was moved to the United First Parish Church shortly after on the initiative of her son.

==Legacy==

Adams&#x27;s role as a first lady has received relatively little scholarly analysis compared to the rest of her life, as she did not keep a diary during her years in the White House. She was reclusive during her tenure, and she did not have significant influence in shaping the role.

Adams was the first foreign-born U.S. first lady, as she was born in England and did not visit the United States until adulthood. She remained the only foreign born first lady until Slovenian-American Melania Trump took the role in 2017. Adams was regarded by contemporaries as the &quot;most traveled woman of her time&quot;, and she was the only first lady of the 19th century to travel so widely.

Adams National Historical Park maintains Peacefield, the home Adams and her husband lived in some of the time later in their lives. The park has a bedspread on display at Peacefield which she made, as well as a painting of her by Edward Savage. For some time the painting was still owned by Adams&#x27;s great-great-granddaughter, Mrs. Henry L. Mason, and was loaned to the museum seasonally. The Smithsonian&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery holds several portraits of Louisa Catherine Adams, including a silhouette and a portrait on an ivory necklace.

=== Historian polling ===
Since 1982 Siena College Research Institute has periodically conducted surveys asking historians to assess American first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. Consistently, Adams has been ranked in the upper-half of first ladies by historians in these surveys. In terms of cumulative assessment, Adams has been ranked:
*14th-best of 42 in 1982
*16th-best of 37 in 1993
*12th-best of 38 in 2003
*21st-best of 38 in 2008
*18th-best of 38 in 2014

In the 2014 survey, Adams and her husband were also ranked the 19th-highest out of 39 first couples in terms of being a &quot;power couple&quot;.

<text>The Jin Mao Tower (; Shanghainese:&quot; Cinmeu Dagho&quot;; lit. ‘Golden Prosperity Building’), also known as the or , is a , 88-story (93 if counting the floors in the spire) landmark skyscraper in Lujiazui, Pudong, Shanghai, China. It contains a shopping mall, offices and the Grand Hyatt Shanghai hotel which starts from the 53rd floor; at the time of completion it was the highest hotel in the world. Along with the Oriental Pearl Tower, the Shanghai World Financial Center and the Shanghai Tower, it is part of the Lujiazui skyline seen from the Bund. It was the tallest building in China from its completion in 1999 until 2007, when it was surpassed by the nearby Shanghai World Financial Center. The Shanghai Tower, a 128-story building located next to these two buildings, surpassed the height of both these buildings in 2015, creating the world&#x27;s first trio of adjacent supertall skyscrapers.

==Structure==

The building is located on a plot of land near the Lujiazui metro station and was built at an estimated cost of US$530 million.

It was designed by the Chicago firm of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM). Its postmodern form, whose complexity rises as it ascends, draws on traditional Chinese architecture such as the tiered pagoda, gently stepping back to create a rhythmic pattern as it rises. Like the Petronas Towers in Malaysia, the building&#x27;s proportions revolve around the number 8, associated with prosperity in Chinese culture. The 88 floors (93 if the spire floors are counted) are divided into 16 segments, each of which is 1/8 shorter than the 16-story base. The tower is built around an octagon-shaped concrete shear wall core surrounded by 8 exterior composite supercolumns and 8 exterior steel columns. Three sets of 8 two-story high outrigger trusses connect the columns to the core at six of the floors to provide additional support.

The foundations rest on 1,062 high-capacity steel piles driven deep in the ground to compensate for poor upper-strata soil conditions. At the time of construction, these were the longest steel piles ever used for a land-based building. The piles are capped by a 4 m-thick concrete raft underground. The basement&#x27;s surrounding slurry wall is thick, high and long. It is composed of of reinforced concrete.

The building employs an advanced structural engineering system of wind and earthquake engineering which fortify it against typhoon winds of up to 200 km/h (with the top swaying by a maximum of ) and earthquakes of up to 7 on the Richter scale. The steel shafts have shear joints that act as shock absorbers to cushion the lateral forces imposed by winds and quakes. The swimming pool on the 57th floor is also said to act as a passive damper. The exterior curtain wall is made of glass, stainless steel, aluminum, and granite and is criss-crossed by complex latticework cladding made of aluminum alloy pipes.

==Operations==
Official dedication was August 28, 1998, a date also chosen with the number 8 in mind. The building was fully operational in 1999. The Jin Mao Tower is owned by the China Jin Mao Group Co. Ltd (formerly &quot;China Shanghai Foreign Trade Center Co. Ltd&quot;). It reportedly has a daily maintenance cost of 1 million RMB (US$121,000).

The building has 3 main entrances to the lobby: two for the office portion and one for the hotel. The basement has express elevators to the observation deck and a parking area for 600 vehicles and 7,500 bicycles. In total, 61 Mitsubishi elevators and 19 escalators carry visitors throughout the building. Levels 51, 52, and 89–93 are mechanical floors, accessible only by service elevators.

===Occupants===
The 3-level basement has a food court, while the first two floors include the Hyatt&#x27;s conference and banquet facilities. The first six floors include a shopping mall, restaurants, and nightclubs, include Pu-J&#x27;s.

The lower 50 floors (in the first 4 segments of the tower) are made up of of offices, divided into 5 elevator zones (3-6, 7-17, 18-29, 30-40, and 41-50). Office spaces are open-plan (column-free), with a floor-to-floor gross height of and net height of .

===Grand Hyatt Shanghai===

The building&#x27;s anchor tenant is the five-star 555-room Grand Hyatt Shanghai hotel which occupies floors 53 to 87. It is one of the highest hotels in the world, second in Shanghai only to its sister property, the Shanghai Park Hyatt, occupying the 79th to 93rd floors of the immediately adjacent Shanghai World Financial Center. These have since been surpassed by The Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong, which occupies floors 102 to 118 of the International Commerce Center in Hong Kong. However, the tallest building to be used exclusively as a hotel is the JW Marriott Marquis Dubai. Additionally, the world&#x27;s longest laundry chute runs down the full length of the tower to the basement, incorporating buffers to slow the laundry during its descent.

The Hyatt&#x27;s famous barrel-vaulted atrium starts at the 56th floor and extends upwards to the 87th. Lined with 28 annular corridors and staircases arrayed in a spiral, it is in diameter with a clear height of approximately . It is one of the tallest atria in the world, the tallest being the Burj Al Arab&#x27;s.

The hotel floors also feature:
* 53: The Piano Bar, a jazz club.
* 54: The hotel lobby and Grand Café, served by an express elevator from the tower&#x27;s ground floor.
* 55: Canton, a high-end Cantonese restaurant that takes up the entire floor.
* 56: A collection of restaurants including The Grill, the Italian Cucina, the Japanese Kobachi, and the Patio Lounge located at the base of the atrium.
* 57: Club Oasis, a fitness club featuring what was once the world&#x27;s highest swimming pool.
* 85: The highest level of rooms in the hotel and elevators to the two levels above
* 86: Club Jin Mao, a Shanghainese restaurant.
* 87: Cloud 9, a sky bar with panoramic view.

===Skywalk===
The Skywalk, a indoor observation deck with a capacity of 1,000+ people, occupies the 88th floor of the building. In addition to the panoramic views of Shanghai, it offers a topside view of the hotel atrium below. It also includes a small post office. Access is through two express elevators from the basement that travel at 9.1 m/s and take 45 seconds to reach the top. As of 2009, admission to the 88th floor costs 88 RMB for adults and 45 RMB for children.

==Events==
* On February 18, 2001, Han Qizhi, a 31-year-old shoe salesman from Anhui province &quot;struck by a rash impulse&quot;, climbed the building barehanded and in street clothes. He was arrested with bleeding hands and detained for about two weeks.
* On October 5, 2004, as part of Shanghai&#x27;s National Day celebrations, a multi-national group of BASE jumpers invited by the Shanghai Sports Bureau leapt from the top of the tower. The 34-year-old Australian jumper Roland Simpson&#x27;s parachute malfunctioned and he crashed himself against an adjacent building. He fell into a coma and died in Australia on October 22.
* In early 2007, the building was illuminated with the name Windows Vista as part of Microsoft&#x27;s marketing campaign for the operating system.
* Also in 2007, after years of being refused permission to climb the building, the French urban climber Alain Robert was arrested, jailed for 5 days, and expelled from China for his unauthorized ascent and descent, made while wearing a Spider-Man costume.
* On April 3, 2009, Shanda used a laser-light show on the tower to advertise the open beta of &quot;&quot;. The image made by the lasers could be seen from 7:30 pm to 10:00 pm and ran until April 12, 2009.

<doc id="415800" wikidata="Q313903" url="?curid=415800" title="John Vorster">
<text>Balthazar Johannes &quot;B. J.&quot; Vorster (; 13 December 1915 – 10 September 1983), better known as John Vorster, was a South African politician who served as the prime minister of South Africa from 1966 to 1978 and the fourth state president of South Africa from 1978 to 1979. Known as B. J. Vorster during much of his career, he came to prefer the anglicized name John in the 1970s.

Vorster strongly adhered to his country&#x27;s policy of apartheid, overseeing (as Minister of Justice) the Rivonia Trial, in which Nelson Mandela was sentenced to life imprisonment for sabotage, (as Prime Minister) the Terrorism Act, the complete abolition of non-white political representation, the Soweto Riots and the Steve Biko crisis. He conducted a more pragmatic foreign policy than his predecessors, in an effort to improve relations between the white minority government and South Africa&#x27;s neighbours, particularly after the break-up of the Portuguese colonial empire. Shortly after the 1978 Internal Settlement in Rhodesia, in which he was instrumental, he was implicated in the Muldergate Scandal. He resigned the premiership in favour of the ceremonial state presidency, from which he was forced out as well eight months later.

== Early life ==

Vorster was born in 1915 in Jamestown, Cape Province, Union of South Africa, the fifteenth child of a successful sheep farmer, Willem Carel Vorster and his wife, Elizabeth Sophia Vorster (née Wagenaar). He attended primary school there. After Vorster entered Stellenbosch University, he involved himself in student politics becoming the chairman of the debating society, deputy chairman of the student council and leader of the junior National Party.

In 1938, Vorster graduated to become a registrar (judge&#x27;s clerk) to the judge president of the Cape Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa but he did not remain in this post for long, setting up his first law practice in Port Elizabeth and his second in the Witwatersrand town of Brakpan.

== Career ==

=== Ossewabrandwag ===

From 1939, Vorster attracted attention by strongly opposing South Africa&#x27;s intervention on the side of the Allies and their former foe the United Kingdom, in World War II. Many Nationalists enthusiastically hoped for a German victory.

Vorster dedicated himself to an anti-British, pro-Nazi organisation called the &quot;Ossewabrandwag&quot; (&quot;Ox-wagon Sentinel&quot;), founded in 1938 in celebration of the centenary of the Great Trek. Under the leadership of Johannes Van Rensburg, the &quot;Ossewabrandwag&quot; conducted many acts of sabotage against South Africa during World War II to limit its war effort. Vorster, who was interned for his activities, which included helping previously interned fugitives, claimed not to have participated in the acts of war attributed to the group. He described himself as anti-British, not pro-Nazi, and said his internment was for anti-British agitation.

Vorster rose rapidly through the ranks of the &quot;Ossewabrandwag&quot; becoming a general in its paramilitary wing. His involvement with this group led to his detention at Koffiefontein in 1942. Following his release from custody in 1944, Vorster became active in the National Party, which began implementing the policy of apartheid in 1948. Although racial discrimination in favour of whites had long been a crucial fact of South African politics and society, formal restrictions were loosening and the National Party institutionalised racism in a new way and on a massive scale through its “apartheid” legislation.

=== House of Assembly ===

In 1953, Vorster was elected to the House of Assembly representing the seat of Nigel in the Transvaal. He was appointed as Deputy Minister in 1958. He was an MP during the terms of prime ministers D.F. Malan, J.G. Strijdom and Hendrik Verwoerd. Vorster&#x27;s wartime anti-British activities came back to haunt him. Vorster answered his critics by saying that he had now &quot;come to believe in&quot; the parliamentary system.

A leader of the right wing of the National Party, he was appointed Minister of Justice in 1961 by prime minister Verwoerd, an outspoken mentor and idol of Vorster. He combined that with the Minister of Police and Prisons in 1966.

Upon Verwoerd&#x27;s assassination in 1966, Vorster was elected by the National Party to succeed him, and continued Verwoerd&#x27;s implementation of apartheid legislation, including the 1968 abolition of the last four parliamentary seats that had been reserved for white representatives of Coloured (mixed race) voters (realised in 1970). Despite this, Vorster&#x27;s rule oversaw several other such proposed bills dropped, as well the repealing of legislation prohibiting multi-racial sports teams in order to allow for South Africa to compete at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico. Despite Vorster&#x27;s efforts, protests by numerous African nations meant that the IOC refused permission for South Africa&#x27;s proposed team to compete.

As a personal figure, Vorster was described as &quot;flesh and blood&quot; by Progressive MP Helen Suzman in contrast to the &quot;diabolical&quot; and &quot;frightening&quot; Verwoerd. His supporters held him in great affection for his eccentricities. Examples of this were the occasion when he briefed the opposition in his private chambers, his allowing pictures of himself to be taken in often precarious situations and then to be distributed publicly as well as his welcoming of foreigners, in his words, to &quot;the happiest police state in the world&quot;. This new outlook in the leadership of South Africa was dubbed &quot;billikheid&quot; or &quot;sweet reasonableness&quot;. He alienated an extremist faction of his National Party when it accepted the presence of Māori players and spectators during the tour of the New Zealand national rugby union team in South Africa in 1970.

Vorster was more pragmatic than his predecessors when it came to foreign policy. He improved relations with other African nations, such as by the adoption of his policy of letting Black African diplomats live in white areas in South Africa. He unofficially supported, but refused officially to recognise, the neighbouring state of Rhodesia, whose predominantly white minority government had unilaterally declared independence (UDI) from the UK in 1965. Vorster followed white public opinion in South Africa by supporting Rhodesia publicly, but was unwilling to alienate important political allies in the United States by extending diplomatic recognition to Rhodesia.

The collapse of Portuguese rule in Angola and Mozambique in 1975 left South Africa and Rhodesia as the sole outposts of white minority rule on the continent: while Vorster was unwilling to make any concessions to his country&#x27;s majority population, he soon realised that white rule would be untenable in a country where blacks outnumbered whites.

In September 1976, under pressure from US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, he pressured Ian Smith, the Rhodesian Prime Minister, to accept in principle that white minority rule could not continue indefinitely. Smith and moderate black nationalist leaders signed the Internal Settlement in March 1978, and in June 1979, following multiracial elections, Rhodesia was reconstituted under black majority rule as Zimbabwe Rhodesia which, in this form, also lacked any international recognition.

=== Information Scandal ===

After the Soweto Uprising in 1976, as Prime Minister, Vorster encouraged the Department of Information to engage in clandestine activities in and outside South Africa. Vorster did not inform his cabinet of these activities and financed them through a secret defence account. When the auditor general made a critical report, a scandal broke out, ultimately leading to the resignation of Vorster. This scandal was colloquially known to some as &quot;South African Watergate&quot;.

=== State President and retirement ===

Vorster resigned as Prime Minister in 1978, after twelve years in office. He was succeeded by P. W. Botha, a hardliner who nevertheless began the first reforms to moderate the apartheid system. Following his resignation as Prime Minister, Vorster was elected to the largely honorary position of State President. His tenure in his new office, however, was short-lived. In what came to be known as the Muldergate Scandal so named after Dr Connie Mulder, the Cabinet minister at its centre, Vorster was implicated in the use of a secret slush fund to establish &quot;The Citizen&quot;, the only major English-language newspaper that was favourable to the National Party. A commission of inquiry concluded in mid-1979 that Vorster &quot;knew everything&quot; about the corruption and had tolerated it. He resigned from the state presidency in disgrace. In 1982, John Vorster supported the Conservative Party of Andries Treurnicht at its founding congress. He died in 1983, aged 67 years.

===Legacy under apartheid===

Using the Group Areas Act, Stellenbosch University dispossessed coloured residents of central Stellenbosch of their land in order to expand the university. They named the building built there after B.J. Vorster, an alumnus and chancellor of the university. It was renamed in the 1990s.

Johannesburg Central Police Station was formerly called John Vorster Square, and was the home of South Africa&#x27;s Special Branch during the apartheid era.

<doc id="415801" wikidata="Q390279" url="?curid=415801" title="Yotsuba&amp;!">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kiyohiko Azuma, the creator of &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot;. It has been serialized since January 2003 in the monthly magazine &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot; by ASCII Media Works, formerly MediaWorks, and has since been collected into 16 &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes. It depicts the everyday adventures of a young girl named Yotsuba as she learns about the world around her, guided by her adoptive father, their neighbors, and their friends. Several characters in &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; were previously featured in a one-shot manga by Azuma called &quot;Try! Try! Try!&quot; The phrase &quot;Yotsuba to&quot; means &quot;Yotsuba and,&quot; a fact reflected in the chapter titles, most of which take the form &quot;Yotsuba and [&quot;something&quot;].&quot;

The manga was licensed for English-language distribution by ADV Manga, which released five volumes between 2005 and 2007. Volume six was originally set to release to in February 2008, but was indefinitely delayed. At New York Comic Con 2009, Yen Press announced that it had acquired the North American license for the series; it reprinted the first five volumes with new translations along with volume six in September 2009, and is continuing with later volumes.

The manga has received widespread acclaim from critics and audiences due to Azuma&#x27;s artistic talent, writing, and the creation and development of the titular character, with the manga earning multiple awards and nominations.

== Plot ==

&quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; is centered on Yotsuba Koiwai, a five-year-old girl who is energetic, cheerful, curious, odd, and quirky—so much so that even her own father calls her unusual. She is also initially ignorant about many things that a child her age would be expected to know—among them doorbells, escalators, air conditioners, and even playground swings. This is the premise of humorous stories whereby which she learns about—and frequently misunderstands—everyday things.

At the start of the series, Yotsuba and her adoptive father, Yousuke Koiwai, relocate to a new city with the help of Koiwai&#x27;s best friend, an impressively tall man named Takashi Takeda, known as Jumbo. Yotsuba makes a strong impression on the three daughters of the neighboring Ayase family, Asagi, Fuuka, and Ena, after Ena meets Yotsuba trying to find out how a swing works. Most of her daily activities and misadventures often originate from interactions with these characters and more, such as Asagi&#x27;s friend Torako, known as Tiger (from Yotsuba, the kanji for &quot;Tora&quot; is the same kanji in &quot;tiger&quot;).

The series has no consistent plot continuity—the focus of the stories is Yotsuba&#x27;s daily voyage of discovery. Many chapters take place on successive days (for details, see &quot;List of Yotsuba&amp;! chapters&quot;), so that the series follows, almost literally, the characters&#x27; daily lives. The tone can be summarized by the motto, used on chapter title pages and advertising: , or in the original translation, &quot;Enjoy Everything&quot;.

== Development ==
In 1998, Azuma published a one-shot manga and two webcomics called &quot;Try! Try! Try!&quot;, in which Yotsuba&#x27;s adoptive father Yousuke Koiwai, Ena, Fūka, and Asagi first appear. Although some of these characters—including Yotsuba herself—are largely the same as in &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot;; Fūka has a different character design, a more mischievous personality, and a different spelling of her given name (in &quot;Try! Try! Try!&quot;, it is written with the kanji , meaning &quot;wind-summer&quot;; in &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot;, it is , meaning &quot;wind-scent&quot;).

Azuma started writing &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; a year after the conclusion of his previous manga, &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot;. No crossovers between the two works occured until sixteenth volume of &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; in 2025, which features a cameo appearance from &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot; character Ayumu &quot;Osaka&quot; Kasuga, who is revealed to now be working as a P.E. teacher.

== Media ==
=== Manga ===

The manga is written and illustrated by Kiyohiko Azuma, and published by ASCII Media Works in the monthly &quot;shōnen&quot; (aimed at teenage boys) manga magazine &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot; since the March 2003 issue, with serialization on-going. Chapters have been collected in sixteen &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes.

In English, &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; was originally licensed by ADV Manga, who published five volumes between 2005 and 2007 before dropping the license. The North American license was picked up by Yen Press, which republished the first five volumes along with the sixth in September 2009. Fourteen volumes have since been released. In addition, the series is licensed in Malaysia in both English and Malay by Kadokawa Gempak Starz, in France by Kurokawa, in Spain by Norma Editorial, in Germany by Tokyopop Germany, in Italy by Dynit, in Sweden by B. Wahlström, in Finland by Punainen jättiläinen, in Korea by Daiwon C.I., in Taiwan by Kadokawa Media, in Russia by Palma Press in Vietnam by TVM Comics, in Poland by Kotori, in Indonesia by Elex Media Komputindo and in Thailand by NED Comics.

Each chapter of &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; takes place on a specific, nearly sequential day of a common year starting on Wednesday. The year was initially believed to be 2003, coinciding with the date of the manga&#x27;s serialization, but Azuma has stated that the manga always takes place in the present day. This allows the appearance of products created after 2003, such as the Nintendo DS Mr. Ayase plays in chapter forty-two.

=== Calendars ===
Both monthly and daily &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; calendars have been released every year since 2005, although a monthly calendar for 2009 was not released due to constraints on Azuma&#x27;s schedule. The 2005 edition of the monthly calendar featured pictures of Yotsuba playing with animals such as lions, zebras, and kangaroos. The 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2010 editions feature photographs altered to include Yotsuba doing such things as playing with other children or reaching for a balloon. The photographs were by Miho Kakuta, with drawings by Kiyohiko Azuma. The daily calendars have a mix of original and manga artwork, with occasional captions, as well as other fun items—for example, the 2006 calendar had a game of shiritori ongoing through the year. The daily calendars run from April to March, following the Japanese school year instead of the calendar year.

The 2010 monthly calendar was released in November 2009.

=== Music ===
Two &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; music CDs have been released, both purely instrumental, called &quot;image albums&quot;. The music is designed to elicit mental images of events described by the titles. Both albums are composed by Masaki Kurihara and performed by the Kuricorder Pops Orchestra, who also worked together on the &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot; soundtrack.
* The first album, &quot;Yotsuba&amp;♪&quot;, released in April 2005, follows Yotsuba throughout the course of a typical day.
* The second album, &quot;Yotsuba&amp;♪ Music Suite (General Winter)&quot;, released in November 2006, depicts the season of winter, including Christmas and New Year&#x27;s celebrations. is a personification of harsh winters, similar to Jack Frost.

=== Picture books ===
A &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; picture book, &quot;Yotsuba &amp; Monochrome Animals&quot;, was published on 16 December 2006 (). The book has pictures of Yotsuba playing with various black-and-white colored animals, such as pandas. The name of each animal is given in Japanese and English, along with the scientific classification of the species. Another book, called &quot;Find Yotsuba&quot;—which is actually a compilation of all previously released calendar illustrations— was released on 31 August 2013 ().

=== Anime ===

An anime spin-off based on cat versions of Azuma&#x27;s character Danbo titled &quot;Nyanbo!&quot; was announced and began airing on 26 September 2016 as part of a &quot;mini anime&quot; program. This project did not adapt any of &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot;. The spin-off is aired in Japan on NHK-E and is simulcast overseas on Crunchyroll.

Despite its popularity and the success of &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot;, no plans have been announced for an anime adaptation of &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot;. In an entry posted on his website on 15 May 2005, Azuma said there were no plans for it to be animated; he reiterated this on 5 December 2008, claiming that the stories and style of &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; are not well-suited for animation.

== Reception ==
&quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; is drawn not in the vertical four-panel strips of Azuma&#x27;s earlier series, &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot;, but in a full-page format, giving him more artistic scope. Azuma&#x27;s work on &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; has been noted for its clean art, detailed backgrounds, and expressive faces. Azuma is also praised for his joyous tone, slice-of-life storytelling, comedic writing, and eccentric yet realistic characters, especially Yotsuba herself.

The Comics Reporter described the series as &quot;read[ing] like a love letter to the way kids can be at the age of 2–5,&quot; and a reviewer at Anime News Network compared Azuma&#x27;s ability to capture &quot;the wonder of childhood&quot; to Bill Watterson&#x27;s in &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;. &quot;&quot; described it as &quot;a light, feel-good manga, like an endless summer day&quot;. Nicholas Penedo of &quot;Animeland&quot; said &quot;with Yotsuba, we find ourselves plunged into the wonderful world of childhood,&quot; calling the French edition of volume eight, &quot;A beautiful manga for children and adults.&quot; &quot;BD Gest&quot; praised Azuma&#x27;s skill in making distinct secondary characters, calling them &quot;immediately recognisable&quot;, and saying that they each spice up the story in their own ways. However, Azuma has been criticized for creating characters that are &quot;too clean, too perfectly functional&quot;, for overusing &quot;outrageous expressions and reactions&quot;, and for dragging out jokes too long.

&quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; has been popular with readers as well as reviewers. For example, on Amazon.co.jp, volume six was the third best-selling comic in Japan for the first half of 2007, and volume eight was the second best-selling comic in Japan for 2008; volumes seven and eight both were number two on the Tohan comics chart the week they debuted. Volume eight sold more than 450,000 copies in 2008, making it one of the top 50 bestselling manga volumes on the Oricon chart for the year. The first five volumes of the English translation were each among the top 100 selling graphic novels in the United States in the month of release. Volume six of the English edition reached number 3 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller list for manga, and it stayed on the list for four weeks. Volume 8 debuted at No. 2 on the manga best seller list. As of 27 April 2018, over 13.7 million copies of the manga have been printed in Japan and over 3 million outside of Japan, including the U.S., France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Russia, Sweden, Finland, Korea, China, Taiwan, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam.

=== Awards and recognitions ===

&quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; received an Excellence Award for Manga at the 2006 Japan Media Arts Festival, where the jury citation praised the vivid characters and gentle atmosphere. In 2008 &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; was nominated for the 12th Osamu Tezuka Culture Award and the Eisner Award in the &quot;Best Publication for Kids&quot; category, but did not win either, and was runner-up for the first annual Manga Taishō award. In 2016, &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; won the Grand Prize at the 20th Osamu Tezuka Culture Awards, sharing it with Kei Ichinoseki&#x27;s &quot;Hanagami Sharaku&quot;. The English translation was listed as one of the best 20 comics of 2005 by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, one of the best comics of 2006 by the staff of &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;, and one of the top graphic novels for teens in 2008 by YALSA. Volume 1 was named Book of the Month in the June 2005 issue of &quot;Newtype USA&quot;.

There was an exhibit of &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; artwork at the Gallery of Fantastic Art in Tokyo from 2–17 December 2006. The lead article of the May 2009 issue of the Japanese design magazine &quot;Idea&quot; was a study of &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot;, focusing on book design, interior layout, and how translated editions were handled.

<text>The Oriental Pearl Tower is a futurist TV tower in Lujiazui, Shanghai. Built from 1991 to 1994, the tower was the tallest structure in China until the completion of nearby World Financial Center in 2007. Its status as Shanghai&#x27;s first AAAAA tourist attraction, the tower&#x27;s unique architecture, height, and fifteen observation decks have made it a cultural icon of the city.

==Architecture==
The top floor of the Oriental Pearl tower is at , which, combined with its antenna, makes the tower tall. The tower was the tallest freestanding structure in China and Asia from 1994 to 2007, but was later surpassed by Canton Tower in Guangzhou.

===Foundation===
Located in Lujiazui on the banks of the Huangpu River, the Oriental Pearl Tower stands directly opposite of the Bund. Due to the area&#x27;s soft soil, large concrete pillars were planted deep within the ground. Steel pipes and plates provided additional support. This technology was later used in nearby Jin Mao Tower.

===Spheres===
Three large spherical platforms are connected by three pillars and an elevator in-between. According to its designers, the design, which reflects the culture of Shanghai, was inspired by &quot;Pipa xing&quot;, a poem by Tang poet Bai Juyi. The spheres, which were constructed using an integral steel framework, are covered by concrete tiles and laminated red glass panes.

===Observation levels===
The tower has fifteen observatory levels. Lower levels house amenities including a revolving restaurant, indoor roller coaster, and museums. Several levels, including the highest one, have panoramic glass floors. There is also a 20-room hotel, named the Space Hotel, between the two large spheres.

==History==
===Planning===
An initial idea of building a new TV tower in downtown Shanghai in order to increase capacity and replace older infrastructure was introduced in a broadcast on August 25, 1983. On November 17 of the same year, the plan was refined and presented in Shanghai Media Group&#x27;s sixth five-year plan. The tower was planned to be .

On March 25, 1984, the idea was formally proposed to the city congress, which chose a site site in Lujiazui, an area rapidly developing due to economic reform. The decision was made official by the Shanghai Radio and Television Bureau on August 23.

In October 1986, the final proposal, which included a raise in the tower&#x27;s planned height to , was submitted to the National Planning Commission, which approved it in January of the following year.

In September 1988, a total of 12 designs from three firms were received. East China Architectural Design Institute&#x27;s &quot;Oriental Pearl&quot; design was selected.

===Construction and opening===
On July 30, 1991, the tower&#x27;s foundation was laid and construction began. On December 14, 1993, the tower&#x27;s body was cappied. On Labour Day of the following year, the antenna was installed after 11 days of ascension. On National Day, interior facilities were completed began operating, marking the end of construction.

The Oriental Pearl Tower opened to the public a year later, and its first broadcast, which contained five TV programs and radio, was made.

==Impact==
===Awards===
In 1995, 15 foreign heads of government visited the tower. A year later, another 35 foreign heads of government and 30 groups of foreign minister-level government officials visited the tower. The tower has been included in numerous lists, including &quot;Top Ten New Landscapes in Shanghai&quot;, &quot;Top Ten New Landmarks in Shanghai&quot;, and the list of AAAAA Tourist Attractions of China.

===In popular culture===

Since its opening, the Oriental Pearl Tower has been a cultural icon of Shanghai. The tower has been depicted in various artworks and media and attracts millions of tourists yearly.

<text>Down Street, also known as Down Street (Mayfair), is a disused station on the London Underground, located in Mayfair, west London. The Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway opened it in 1907. It was latterly served by the Piccadilly line and was situated between Dover Street (now named Green Park) and Hyde Park Corner stations.

The station was little used; many trains passed through without stopping. Lack of patronage and proximity to other stations led to its closure in 1932. During the Second World War it was used as a bunker by the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and the war cabinet. The station building survives and is close to Down Street&#x27;s junction with Piccadilly. Part of it is now converted to a retail outlet.

London Transport Museum has been running guided tours of the station through its &quot;Hidden London&quot; programme since 2016. The tour covers the history of the site using archives from the museum&#x27;s collection, with a focus on its Second World War connection.

==History==
===Operation===

The station is in Down Street in Mayfair, just off Piccadilly and a short distance from Park Lane. It lies between Green Park (originally named Dover Street) and Hyde Park Corner on the Piccadilly line. It was opened by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR; the precursor to the Piccadilly line) on 15 March 1907, a few months after the rest of the line opened. The delay was due to difficulties in purchasing the site for the station building and agreeing a safe layout of the passages below ground with the Board of Trade. The surface building was designed by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London&#x27;s (UERL&#x27;s) architect Leslie Green in the UERL house style of a two-storey steel-framed building faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. The station had a pair of Otis lifts, with the platforms located below the street level of Piccadilly.

Down Street was never a busy station, as the surrounding area was largely residential and its residents mostly wealthy enough to travel by other means. The neighbouring stations were also close by, with Dover Street station about to the east and Hyde Park Corner to the west. From 1909, like Brompton Road, Down Street was often skipped by trains. From 1918 it was closed on Sundays.

In 1929, Down Street was one of the stations suggested for closure in connection with the extension of the Piccadilly line: the elimination of less-busy stations in the central area would improve both reliability and journey times for long-distance commuters. Additionally, the neighbouring stations were being rebuilt with escalators in place of lifts and their new entrances were even nearer to Down Street, further squeezing its catchment area. The station was permanently closed on 21 May 1932.

After the station was closed it was almost immediately modified. The western headwalls of both platform tunnels were rebuilt to allow a step plate junction to be installed, providing access from the eastbound and westbound tunnels to a new siding located between Down Street and Hyde Park Corner. The siding is mainly used to reverse westbound trains, but could also be used for servicing trains. The siding tunnel is accessible at its western end through a small foot tunnel constructed from Hyde Park Corner station. The lifts were removed and the shafts adapted to provide additional tunnel ventilation.
===Wartime use and after===
The station was selected for use as an underground bunker in early 1939 as part of a programme of developing deep shelters to protect government operations from bombing in the event of war. The platform faces were bricked up and the enclosed platform areas and space in the circulation passages were divided up into offices, meeting rooms and dormitories. The engineering and structural work was carried out by the London Passenger Transport Board and the fitting-out of the rooms and installation of the power and communications equipment was done by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. A two-person lift was installed in the original emergency stairwell and a telephone exchange, toilets and bathrooms were added. The main occupant of the shelter was the Railway Executive Committee, but it was also used as a shelter by the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and the war cabinet until the Cabinet War Rooms were ready; Churchill called it &quot;The Barn&quot;.

Since the end of the war, the station has been used only for engineering access and as an emergency exit point from the Underground.

In April 2015, Transport for London announced that it was seeking proposals for the commercial use of parts of the surface building, disused lift shaft and underground passages. Suggested possible uses included a restaurant, a bar, a theatre, a gallery or retail space. Tours by the London Transport Museum through its &quot;Hidden London&quot; programme began in 2016.

==Use in media==
Down Street is the inspiration for a location in the television series and novel &quot;Neverwhere&quot;, where it provides an entrance to an underground labyrinth. A much modified and expanded version of the station appears as a part of a level in the video game &quot;Shadow Man&quot;, which was used as Jack the Ripper&#x27;s hideout.

Part of the 2004 British horror film &quot;Creep&quot; was set in Down Street station, although the scenes were actually shot at the disused Aldwych station and on studio sets. The British band Hefner released a song titled &quot;Down Street&quot; on their 2006 album &quot;Catfight&quot;; according to its sleeve notes, it is set in the early 1930s and tells the story of two lovers who meet at the station. Steve Hackett also recorded a song titled &quot;Down Street&quot; on his 2006 album &quot;Wild Orchids&quot;, about the station.

The station features in Billy Connolly&#x27;s &quot;World Tour of England, Ireland and Wales&quot;, Dan Cruickshank&#x27;s National Geographic Channel series &quot;Great Railway Adventures&quot; and the 2012 TV series &quot;The Tube&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Down Street is mentioned in &quot;The Man in the Brown Suit&quot; and &quot;The Mystery of the Blue Train&quot; by Agatha Christie, and &quot;Neverwhere&quot; by Neil Gaiman.

<text>was a Japanese soldier who served as a sergeant in the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) during the Second World War, and was one of the last three Japanese holdouts to be found after the end of hostilities in 1945. He was discovered in the jungles of Guam on 24 January 1972, almost 28 years after U.S. forces had regained control of the island in 1944.

==Biography==
Yokoi was born in Saori, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. He was an apprentice tailor when he was conscripted in 1941.

Initially, Yokoi served with the 29th Infantry Division in Manchukuo. In 1943, he was transferred to the 38th Regiment in the Mariana Islands and arrived on Guam in February 1943. When American forces captured the island in the 1944 Battle of Guam, Yokoi went into hiding with nine other Japanese soldiers. Seven of the original ten eventually moved away and only three remained in the region. These men separated, but visited each other periodically until about 1964, when the other two died in a flood. For the last eight years before his discovery, Yokoi lived alone. He survived by hunting, primarily at night. He also used native plants to make clothes, bedding, and storage implements, which he carefully hid in his cave. 

On the evening of 24 January 1972, Yokoi was discovered by two local men checking shrimp traps along a small river on Talofofo. They had assumed Yokoi was a villager from Talofofo, but he thought his life was in danger and attacked them. They managed to subdue him and carried him out of the jungle.

Yokoi later said that he expected the local men to kill him at first but was surprised when instead they allowed him to eat hot soup at their home before turning him over to the authorities. He was in relatively good health, but slightly anemic due to a lack of salt in his diet, according to doctors at Guam Memorial Hospital. His diet included wild nuts, mangos, papaya, shrimp, snails, frogs, and rats.

&quot;It is with much embarrassment that I return,&quot; he said upon his return to Japan in March 1972. The remark quickly became a popular saying in Japan.
He had known since 1952 that World War II had ended but feared coming out of hiding, explaining: &quot;We Japanese soldiers were told to prefer death to the disgrace of getting captured alive.&quot;

After a whirlwind media tour of Japan, Yokoi married and settled down in rural Aichi Prefecture. He became a popular television personality and an advocate of simple living. He was featured in a 1977 documentary film called &quot;Yokoi and His Twenty-Eight Years of Secret Life on Guam.&quot; He eventually received the equivalent of US$300 in back pay, and a small pension. Although he never met Emperor Shōwa, while visiting the grounds of the Imperial Palace, Yokoi said, &quot;Your Majesties, I have returned home ... I deeply regret that I could not serve you well. The world has certainly changed, but my determination to serve you will never change.&quot;

Yokoi died in 1997 of a heart attack at the age of 82.

The Shoichi Yokoi Memorial Hall opened in 2006 in Nakagawa-ku, Nagoya, and closed in 2022 after the death of its director and Yokoi&#x27;s wife, Mihoko.

<doc id="415810" wikidata="Q300961" url="?curid=415810" title="Hector's dolphin">
<text>Hector&#x27;s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori) is one of four dolphin species belonging to the genus &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot;. Hector&#x27;s dolphin is the only cetacean endemic to New Zealand, and comprises two subspecies: &quot;C. h. hectori&quot;, the more numerous subspecies, also referred to as South Island Hector&#x27;s dolphin; and the critically endangered Māui dolphin (&quot;C. h. maui&quot;), found off the West Coast of the North Island.

==Etymology==
Hector&#x27;s dolphin was named after Sir James Hector (1834–1907), who was the curator of the Colonial Museum in Wellington (now the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa). He examined the first specimen of the dolphin found by cephologists. The species was scientifically described by Belgian zoologist Pierre-Joseph van Beneden in 1881. Māori names for Hector&#x27;s and Māui dolphin include &quot;tutumairekurai, tupoupou&quot; and &quot;popoto&quot;.

==Description==
Hector&#x27;s dolphin is the smallest dolphin species. Mature adults have a total length of and weigh . The species is sexually dimorphic, with females being about 5–7% longer than males. The body shape is stocky, with no discernible beak. The most distinctive feature is the rounded dorsal fin, with a convex trailing edge and undercut rear margin.

The overall coloration appearance is pale grey, but closer inspection reveals a complex and elegant combination of colours. The back and sides are predominantly light grey, while the dorsal fin, flippers, and flukes are black. The eyes are surrounded by a black mask, which extends forward to the tip of the rostrum and back to the base of the flipper. A subtly shaded, crescent-shaped black band crosses the head just behind the blowhole. The throat and belly are creamy white, separated by dark-grey bands meeting between the flippers. A white stripe extends from the belly onto each flank below the dorsal fin.

At birth, Hector&#x27;s dolphin calves have a total length of and weigh . Their coloration is the almost same as adults, although the grey has a darker hue. Newborn Hector&#x27;s dolphins have distinct fetal fold marks on their flanks that cause a change in coloration pattern of the skin. These changes are visible for approximately six months and consist of four to six vertical light grey stripes against darker grey skin.

==Life history==

Data from field studies, beachcast individuals, and dolphins caught in fishing nets have provided information on their life history and reproductive parameters. Photo-ID based observations at Banks Peninsula from 1984 to 2006 show that individuals can reach at least 22 years of age. Males attain sexual maturity between 6 and 9 years old and females begin calving between 7 and 9 years old. Females will continue to calve every 2–3 years, resulting in a maximum of 4–7 calves in one female&#x27;s lifetime. Calving occurs during the spring and summer. Calves are assumed to be weaned at around one year of age, and the mortality rate in the first 6 months was estimated to be around 36%.

These combined life-history characteristics mean that, like many other cetaceans, Hector&#x27;s dolphins are only capable of slow population growth. Their maximum population growth rate was previously estimated to be 1.8–4.9% per year, based on old demographic information, which was then updated to 3–7% per year, based on updated demographic information and a life history invariant observed across all vertebrates 

==Ecology==

===Habitat===
The species&#x27; range includes murky coastal waters out to depth, though almost all sightings are in waters shallower than . Hector&#x27;s dolphins display a seasonal inshore-offshore movement; favouring shallow coastal waters during spring and summer, and moving offshore into deeper waters during autumn and winter. They have also been shown to return to the same location during consecutive summers, displaying high foraging site fidelity. The inshore-offshore movement of Hector&#x27;s dolphins are thought to relate to seasonal patterns of turbidity and the inshore movements of prey species during spring and summer.

===Diet===
Hector&#x27;s dolphins are generalist feeders, with prey selection based on size (mostly under 10 cm in length) rather than species, although spiny species also appear to be avoided. The largest prey item recovered from a Hector&#x27;s dolphin stomach was an undigested red cod weighing 500 g with a standard length of 35 cm. The stomach contents of dissected dolphins include a mixture of surface-schooling fish, midwater fish, squid, and a variety of benthic species. The main prey species in terms of mass contribution is red cod, and other important prey include Peltorhamphus flatfish, ahuru, New Zealand sprat, Nototodarus arrow squid, and juvenile giant stargazer.

===Predators===
The remains of Hector&#x27;s dolphins have been found in the stomachs of broadnose sevengill shark (considered to be their main predator), great white shark and blue shark. Unconfirmed predators of Hector&#x27;s and Māui dolphins include killer whales (orca), mako sharks and bronze whaler shark.

== Behaviour ==
=== Group dynamics ===
Hector&#x27;s dolphins preferentially form groups of less than 5 individuals, with a mean of 3.8 individuals, that are highly segregated by sex. The majority of these small groups are single sex. Groups of greater than 5 individuals are formed much less frequently. These larger groups, &gt;5, are usually mixed sex and have been shown to form only to forage or participate in sexual behaviour. Nursery groups can also be observed and are usually all female groups of less than 7 mothers and young.

This species has been found to show a high level of fluidity with weak inter-individual associations, meaning they do not form strong bonds with other individuals. Three types of small preferential groups have been found: nursery groups; immature and subadult groups; and adult male/female groups. All of these small groups show a high level of sex segregation. Hector&#x27;s dolphins display a sex-age population group composition, meaning they group by biological sex and age.

=== Sexual behaviour ===
Males of the species have extremely large testes in proportion to body size, with the highest relative weight in one study being 2.9% of body weight. Large testes in combination with males&#x27; smaller overall body size suggests a promiscuous mating system. This type of reproductive system would involve a male attempting to fertilize as many females as possible and little male-male aggression. The amount of sexual behaviour per individual in the species is observed most when small single sex groups form large mixed sex groups. Sexual behaviour in the species is usually non-aggressive.

=== Echolocation ===
Similar to the hourglass dolphin, Hector&#x27;s dolphins use high-frequency echolocation clicks. However, the Hector&#x27;s dolphin produces lower source-level clicks than hourglass dolphins due to their crowded environment. This means they can only spot prey at half the distance compared to an hourglass dolphin. The species has a very simple repertoire with few types of clicks, as well as little audible signals in addition to these. More complex clicks could be observed in large groups.

==Distribution and population size==
Hector&#x27;s and Māui dolphins are endemic to the coastal regions of New Zealand. The Hector&#x27;s dolphin sub-species is most abundant in discontinuous regions of high turbidity around the South Island. They are most abundant off the East Coast and West Coast, most notably around Banks Peninsula, with smaller, more isolated populations off the North Coast and South Coast (notably at Te Waewae Bay). Smaller populations are scattered around the South Island, including: Cook Strait, Kaikōura, Catlins (e.g., Porpoise Bay, Curio Bay), and Otago coasts (e.g.Karitane, Oamaru, Moeraki, Otago Harbour, and Blueskin Bay). Māui dolphin are typically found on the west coast of the North Island between Maunganui Bluff and Whanganui.

An aerial survey of South Island Hector&#x27;s dolphin abundance—which was commissioned by the Ministry for Primary Industries, carried out the Cawthron Institute, and endorsed by the International Whaling Commission—estimated a total population size of 14,849 dolphins (95% confidence interval = 11,923–18,492). This was almost twice the previous, published estimate from earlier surveys (7,300; 95% CI 5,303–9,966). This difference was primarily due to a much larger estimated population along East Coast, which was distributed further offshore than previously thought.

The latest estimate of the Māui dolphin subspecies 2020–2021 is 54 individuals aged 1 year or older (1+) (95% confidence interval (CI) = 48–66).

==Mixing of sub-species==
Occasionally, South Island Hector&#x27;s dolphins (determined from genetics) are found around the North Island, up to Bay of Plenty or Hawke&#x27;s Bay. In 2012, a genetic analysis of tissue samples from dolphins in the core Maui dolphin range, including historical samples, revealed the presence of at least three South Island Hector&#x27;s dolphins off the West Coast of the North Island (two of them alive), along with another five South Island Hector&#x27;s dolphins sampled between Wellington and Oakura from 1967 to 2012.

Previously, the deep waters of the Cook Strait were considered to be an effective barrier to mixing between the South Island Hector&#x27;s and North Island Māui sub-species for around 15,000 and 16,000 years. This is coincident with the separation of the North and South Islands of New Zealand at the end of the last ice age. To date, there is no evidence of interbreeding between South Island Hector&#x27;s dolphin and Māui dolphin, but it is likely they could given their close genetic composition.

==Threats==
=== Fishing ===
Hector&#x27;s and Māui dolphin deaths occur as a direct result of commercial and recreational fishing due to entanglement or capture in gillnets or trawls. Death is ultimately caused by suffocation, although injury and sub-lethal effects can also result from the mechanical abrasion of fins resulting from entanglement. Since the 1970s, gillnets have been made from lightweight monofilament, which is difficult for dolphins to detect. Hector&#x27;s dolphins are actively attracted to trawling vessels and can frequently be seen following trawlers and diving down to the net, which could result in the unwanted bycatch.

Deaths in fishing nets were previously considered to be the most serious threat (responsible for more than 95% of the human-caused deaths in Māui dolphins), with currently lower level threats including tourism, disease, and marine mining. Research of decreases in mitochondrial DNA diversity among hector&#x27;s dolphin populations has suggested that the number of gill-net entanglement deaths likely far surpasses that reported by fisheries. Population simulations estimated that the current population is 30% of the 1970 population size estimate of 50,000 dolphins, based on their estimated capture rate in commercial gillnet fisheries.

The latest government-approved estimates of annual deaths in commercial gillnets (for the period from 2014/15 to 2016/17) was 19–93 South Island Hector&#x27;s dolphins and 0.0–0.3 Māui dolphins annually. The low estimate for Māui dolphin deaths in gillnets is consistent with the lack of any observed captures in commercial setnets off the West Coast of the North Island since late-2012, despite 100% observer coverage in this fishery across this time period. Annual deaths in commercial trawls were estimated to be 0.2–26.6 Hector&#x27;s dolphins and 0.00–0.05 Maui dolphins (from 2014/15 to 2016/17). Based on these levels of mortality, the increased abundance of Hector&#x27;s dolphins and faster population growth potential than previously thought, the commercial fishery threat (alone) would be unlikely to prevent population recovery to at least 80% of unaffected levels, for either Hector&#x27;s or Māui dolphins. However the threat from commercial fishing was estimated to be higher for some regional populations relative to others, e.g., East Coast South Island, and may have a greater effect on certain smaller populations, e.g., Hector&#x27;s dolphins along the Kaikoura Coast.

==== Fishing restrictions ====
The first marine protected area (MPA) for Hector&#x27;s dolphin was designated in 1988 at Banks Peninsula, where commercial gill-netting was effectively prohibited out to offshore and recreational gill-netting was subject to seasonal restrictions. A second MPA was designated on the west coast of the North Island in 2003. Populations continued to decline due to by-catch outside the MPAs.

Additional protection was introduced in 2008, banning gill-netting within 4 nautical miles of the majority of the South Island&#x27;s east and south coasts, out to 2 nautical miles (3.7 km) offshore off the South Island&#x27;s west coast and extending the gillnet ban on the North Island&#x27;s west coast to offshore. Also, restrictions were placed on trawling in some of these areas. For further details on these regulations, see the Ministry of Fisheries website. Five marine mammal sanctuaries were designated in 2008 to manage nonfishing-related threats to Hector&#x27;s and Māui dolphins. Their regulations include restrictions on mining and seismic acoustic surveys. Further restrictions were introduced into Taranaki waters in 2012 and 2013 to protect Māui dolphins.

The Banks Peninsula Marine Mammal Sanctuary was expanded in 2020, with restrictions introduced on seismic surveying and seabed mining. The sanctuary stretches from the Jed River south to the Waitaki River, and extends 20 nautical miles out to sea, a total area of about 14,310 km2.

The Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission has recommended extending protection for Māui dolphin further south to Whanganui and further offshore to 20 nautical miles from the coastline. The IUCN has recommended protecting Hector&#x27;s and Māui dolphins from gill-net and trawl fisheries, from the shoreline to the 100 m depth contour.

=== Infectious diseases ===
The unicellular parasite&quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; is considered to be the main non-fishery cause of death. A 2013 study found that seven of 28 beachcast or bycaught Hector&#x27;s and Māui dolphins died as a result of toxoplasmosis, which had necrotising and haemorrhagic lesions in the lung (n = 7), lymph nodes (n = 6), liver (n = 4) and adrenals (n = 3). The same study found that approximately two-thirds of dolphins had previously been infected with the toxoplasma parasite. An update to this study found that toxoplasmosis had killed nine out of 38 post-weaning age Hector&#x27;s and Māui dolphins found washed up or floating at-sea, and that were not too autolised to determine a cause of death. Of these nine, six were reproductive females, tentatively indicating that this demographic may be more susceptible to infection. In New Zealand, the domestic house cat is the only known definitive host for toxoplasma, and Hector&#x27;s and Maui dolphins are thought to become infected as a result of their preference for turbid coastal waters near river mouths, where toxoplasma oocyst densities are likely to be relatively high.

Brucellosis is a notable bacterial disease of Hector&#x27;s and Māui dolphins that can cause late pregnancy abortion in terrestrial mammals, and has been found in a range of cetacean species elsewhere. Brucellosis has been determined from necropsies to have killed both Hector&#x27;s and Māui dolphins and to have caused reproductive disease, indicating that it may affect the reproductive success of both sub-species.

=== Loss of genetic diversity and population decline ===
The high levels of sex segregation and fragmentation of different populations in Hector&#x27;s dolphin have been discussed as contributing to the overall population decline, as it becomes more difficult for males to find a female and copulate. The Allee effect begins to occur when a low-density population has low reproductive rates leading to increased population decline. In addition, low gene flow between populations may result from this species&#x27; high foraging site fidelity. Hector&#x27;s dolphins have not been found to participate in alongshore migrations, which may also contribute to their lack of genetic diversity.

Samples from 1870 to today have provided a historical timeline for the species&#x27; population decline. Lack of neighboring populations due to fishery-related mortality has decreased gene flow and contributed to an overall loss in mitochondrial DNA diversity. As a result, the populations have become fragmented and isolated, leading to inbreeding. The geographical range has been lessened to the point where gene flow and immigration may no longer be possible between Māui dolphin and Hector&#x27;s dolphin.

Potential interbreeding between Hector&#x27;s and Māui dolphins could increase the numbers of dolphins in the Māui range and reduce the risk of inbreeding depression, but such interbreeding could eventually result in a hybridisation of the Māui back into the Hector&#x27;s species and lead to a reclassification of Māui as again the North Island Hector&#x27;s. Hybridisation in this manner threatens the Otago black stilt and the Chatham Islands&#x27; Forbes parakeet and has eliminated the South Island brown teal as a subspecies. Researchers have also identified potential interbreeding as threatening the Māui with hybrid breakdown and outbreeding depression.

<text>Cephalorhynchus is a genus in the dolphin family Delphinidae.

==Extant species==
It consists of four species:
The species have similar physical features—they are small, generally playful, blunt-nosed dolphins—but they are found in distinct geographical locations.

A phylogenetic analysis in 2006 indicated the two species traditionally assigned to the genus &quot;Lagenorhynchus&quot;, the hourglass dolphin &quot;L. cruciger&quot; and Peale&#x27;s dolphin &quot;L. australis&quot; are actually phylogenetically nested among the species of &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot;, and they suggest these two species should be transferred to the genus &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot;. Some acoustic and morphological data support this arrangement, at least with respect to Peale&#x27;s dolphin.

According to a study in 1971, Peale&#x27;s dolphin and the &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot; species are the only dolphins that do not whistle (no acoustic data are available for the hourglass dolphin). Peale&#x27;s dolphin also shares with several &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot; species the possession of a distinct white &quot;armpit&quot; marking behind the pectoral fin.

<doc id="415813" wikidata="Q333068" url="?curid=415813" title="Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree">
<text>Antony Harold Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree, OBE, PC, DL (29 August 1937 – 25 March 2012) was a British Conservative politician and former Cabinet member. He was the member of Parliament for Braintree from 1974 to 1997, and was later a member of the House of Lords.

==Early life==
Newton was born in Harwich, Essex. He was educated at Friends School Saffron Walden and Trinity College, Oxford, where he was President of Oxford University Conservative Association and the Union. He unsuccessfully fought Sheffield Brightside in the 1970 General Election. In the 1972 Birthday Honours, Newton was appointed to the Order of the British Empire as an Officer (OBE).

==Member of Parliament==
Newton was first elected for the new constituency of Braintree in February 1974 with a majority of 2,001, and successfully retained the seat in the October 1974 general election with a reduced majority of 1,090. The Conservative victory at the 1979 general election boosted his majority dramatically to 12,518, and it increased at every subsequent election to a high of 17,494 at the 1992 general election before his defeat in the Labour landslide at the 1997 general election by 1,451 votes.

===In government===
Newton was appointed a government whip when the Conservatives came to power in 1979. In 1982 he moved to a junior ministerial position at the Department of Health and Social Security, where he remained until 1988, becoming Minister for Social Security and Disabled People in 1984, and Minister for Health in 1986.

In the 1988 New Year Honours, Newton was sworn of the Privy Council. He became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and a minister at the DTI for a year, before being promoted to Secretary of State for Social Security from 1989 to 1992, and then taking up the positions of Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons until 1997. From 1992 to 1995, he answered to Prime Minister’s Questions when Major was not present. His discretion about Major&#x27;s four-year affair with Edwina Currie is credited with enabling Major to become prime minister.

===Peerage===
In the 1997 Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours, after Newton lost his seat, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Newton of Braintree, &quot;of Coggeshall in the County of Essex&quot; on 31 October 1997.

He attempted to be selected for the 1999 European Parliament Election, but was unsuccessful.

In 1998 he was appointed a professional standards director of the Institute of Directors, a position he held until 2004.

Newton chaired the Hansard Society &quot;Commission on Parliamentary Scrutiny&quot; which ran from 1999 to 2001. The Commission concluded that Parliament was being left behind by changes in the constitution, government and society and set out reforms for improving its function.

He became a chairman of the Further Education Funding Council for East Region, serving between 1998 and 2001, the privy councillors&#x27; committee on the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 between 2002 and 2004, the Tax Law Rewrite Steering Committee between 2007 and 2010), the North East Essex Mental Health NHS Trust between 1997 and 2001, the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust between 2001 and 2009, East Anglia&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Hospices between 1998 and 2002 and Help the Hospices between 2002 and 2010, the Council on Tribunals (1998–2007), and its successor the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council (2007–2009); the Standing Conference on Drug Abuse (1997–2001). He became a deputy lieutenant of Essex in 2002

==Personal life==
Newton was married to Janet Huxley from 25 August 1962 until they divorced in 1986. He married Patricia Gilthorpe (née Thomson) on 26 September 1986 after the death of her first husband. Through this marriage, he was the stepfather of British businesswoman Emma Gilthorpe.

Newton was a heavy smoker from an early age. He died at Colchester Hospital of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on 25 March 2012. He was survived by his two daughters from his first marriage.

<text>The Shanghai Museum is a municipal public museum of ancient Chinese art, situated on the People&#x27;s Square in the Huangpu District of Shanghai, China. It is funded by the Shanghai Municipal Culture and Tourism Bureau.

Rebuilt at its current location in 1996, it is famous for its large collection of rare cultural pieces.

==History==

The museum was founded in 1952 and was first open to the public in the former Shanghai Racecourse club house, now at 325 West Nanjing Road. The founding collections came principally from three sources: a batch of artifacts gathered by the Communist 3rd Field Army during the civil war from accidental finds and confiscations of private property and brought to Shanghai upon the Communists&#x27; conquest of the city; artifacts confiscated by the customs service; items sold by private collectors due to political pressure during political purges and purchased by the government. The former Shanghai Municipal Museum was also merged into the new Shanghai Museum.

In the next few years, the museum&#x27;s collections were further enriched from other private and institutional collections in Shanghai, including the collection of the former Shanghai Museum of the Royal Asiatic Society, which were moved to the museum as &quot;foreign&quot; institutions gradually left the city in the 1950s. In 1959 the museum moved into the Zhonghui Building at 16 South Henan Road, which housed insurance companies and bank offices. During the metal-gathering campaign of the Great Leap Forward, the Shanghai Museum participated in rescuing bronzeware from metal that had been confiscated or donated and were sent to be melted down. Before the Cultural Revolution, a tradition formed whereby Shanghai&#x27;s wealthy collectors would make annual donations to the museum.

The museum&#x27;s work largely halted as a result of the Cultural Revolution. After the end of the revolution, as one of China&#x27;s most important museums, the collections have continued to be enriched with the fruit of donations, government purchases, and important finds from archaeological excavations.

The growth of its collections put enormous pressure on the cramped premises. For his role in ensuring a large, purpose-built home, it is said that Shanghai Museum owes much of its current existence to Ma Chengyuan, its director from 1985 until his retirement in 1999. When a new museum was omitted from Shanghai&#x27;s five-year reconstruction plan in 1992, Ma lobbied Mayor Huang Ju for its rebuilding. After seeing the dilapidated rooms of the Zhonghui Building, Huang agreed to allocate a prime site on the People&#x27;s Square, but the museum had to raise its own building funds. Ma raised US$25 million by leasing the old building to a Hong Kong developer. He also made many trips abroad to solicit donations, mainly from the Shanghai diaspora who had fled to Hong Kong after the Communist revolution, raising another $10 million. The money still ran short, but he eventually won another 140 million yuan from the city government to complete the building.

Construction of the current building started in August 1993. It was inaugurated on October 12, 1996 to wide acclaim. It is 29.5 meters high with five floors, covering a total area of 39,200 m2.

Designed by local architect Xing Tonghe, the building is designed in the shape of an ancient bronze cooking vessel called a &quot;ding&quot;. It is said that the inspiration for the design was specifically provided by the Da Ke ding, now on exhibit in the museum. The building has a round top and a square base, symbolizing the ancient Chinese perception of the world as &quot;round sky, square earth&quot; ().

==Collections==

The museum has a collection of over 120,000 pieces, including bronze, ceramics, calligraphy, furniture, jades, ancient coins, paintings, seals, sculptures, minority art and foreign art. 
The Shanghai Museum houses several items of national importance, including one of three extant specimens of a &quot;transparent&quot; bronze mirror from the Han dynasty.

<text>Roman () is a city located in the central part of Western Moldavia, a traditional region of Romania. It is located east of Piatra Neamț, in Neamț County at the confluence of the rivers Siret and Moldova.

Its name was taken from Moldavian Voivode Roman I of Moldavia. From here prince Roman realized the centralization of Moldavia, the city of Roman being the capital of the Lower Country of Moldavia ().

==Geography==
Roman is located in north-eastern Romania, in Neamț County, in the historic region of Moldavia, at the mouth of the Moldova River, a tributary to the Siret. The nearest large city is Bacău, away on national road DN2 and on the CFR Suceava–Bucharest railway; Piatra Neamț, the county capital, is 46 km away and Iași, the historic capital of Moldavia, is away.

==History==
The earliest mention of the city is in the Novgorod Chronicle (dated between 1387 and 1392). Five years later, the name appeared on a donation deed. The city is mentioned in a Moldavian document, signed by Moldavia&#x27;s Voivode Roman I, on March 30. The document is one of the first of documents of the then-young state of Moldavia, being the first which holds a fully legible version of the Moldavia seal, bearing the aurochs, the moon, the star, and the flower, still in use on coat of arms of Moldova.

Roman became a diocesan see in September 14, 1408, when Voivode Roman I&#x27;s son, Alexandru cel Bun, established an Orthodox bishopric in the city. The representatives of the Catholic population of Roman, shepherded by the Bishop of Baia, attended the Council of Constance in 1412. 

Later on in the late 15th century, Ștefan cel Mare built a new stone fortress on the left bank of the Siret River, to replace the old earthen one. Several documents from 1458, 1465, and 1488 during Ștefan&#x27;s reign mention the Cathedral of Saint Paraskeva (Paraschiva) in Roman. In 1467, the fortress resisted the siege of the Hungarian army under King Matthias Corvinus, before the Battle of Baia. In 1476, an Ottoman army, led by Mehmed II, besieged the new fortress again, with the Moldavians retreating after the Battle of Valea Albă.

Petru Rareș ordered the construction of a new episcopal see on the same spot in 1542. The old fortress was apparently destroyed by Dumitrașcu Cantacuzino, following Ottoman command, together with all other Moldavian fortresses. One of the last mentions of it dates back to 1561–1563 during the reign of Ioan Iacob Heraclid. The catholic community had its rights restored around the same time, in 1562, as Ioan Belusiuș, an agent of the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I, wrote his master from Roman, after the severe limitations under Alexandru Lăpușneanu. In 1623, the Catholic community was described by the Franciscan missionary Andreas Bogoslavici in a letter sent to Rome, as Hungarian that understood and used Romanian. The Catholics appear to have a church dedicated to Saint Peter.

In 1569, Lady Ruxandra Lăpușneanu built an Orthodox church dedicated to the Holy Virgin (&quot;Precista Mare&quot;) on the same spot the eponym church is placed today. In 1595, the church &quot;Sfinții Voievozi&quot; was built. The current Armenian Orthodox Church was built in 1610. Some demographic data from 1641, recorded by the Vicar of Sofia, who was passing through Roman, shows there were 1,500 Eastern Orthodox, 450 Armenian Orthodox, and 30 Hungarian Catholics. A major personality of the city was Orthodox bishop Dosoftei, who translated the Psalter into Romanian in 1665–1671. In December 1691, Miron Costin, one of the first historians and writers in Romanian, was decapitated here on the orders of Prince Constantin Cantemir (Dimitrie Cantemir&#x27;s father). Costin was in custody, being carried from Bărboși to Iași, where he hoped to prove his innocence; a few days earlier, the chronicler&#x27;s brother had been killed in Iași, being believed to have attempted to obtain the throne for himself.

The first hospital in Roman was built in 1798 on the place where the Municipal Hospital &quot;Precista Mare&quot; is located today. Talmud Torah, one of the first Jewish schools in the Principality of Moldova, was inaugurated in 1817, an important event in itself as Moldova did not grant citizenship to Jews.
Roman became a railway hub in the 19th century, when the second railway in Romania was opened in December 1869, from Roman to Suceava (Ițcani). One year later, on December 27, 1870, The Bucharest-Galați-Roman railway was also opened, linking Roman to the capital via Mărășești, Tecuci, Galați, Brăila, and Buzău. Right after the inauguration, this railway was closed due to technical problems, but it was reestablished on September 13, 1872. At the same time, after a reluctant government gave its long-waited approval, the first high school of the city, &quot;Roman-Vodă&quot;, was opened on September 30 in the building that is still in use today as that of School No. 1.
In the Communist era, the city lost the county capital status, being included, in 1950-1952 and 1956–1968, in Bacău Region, in 1952–1956 in Iași Region, and then, in 1968, in Neamț County. It also became the target of industrialization: in 1957, the steel tubes factory started production. Roman became an important industrial center in Romania.

After the fall of communism in 1989, most of the heavy industry, relying strongly on state subsidies, went bankrupt and Roman&#x27;s economy struggled. The steel tubes factory was privatized, and it is now owned by the Mittal Steel Company, and the economy started to recover.

<text>Robert Ainsworth (September 16604 April 1743) was an English Latin lexicographer, and author of a well-known compendious &quot;Dictionary of the Latin Tongue&quot;.

==Life==
He was born at Wordsall, in the parish of Eccles, Manchester, in September 1660. After he had finished his own education, he began his career as schoolmaster at Bolton; from there he went to London; and at Bethnal Green, Hackney, and other suburban villages, continued to run a school until he retired some years before his death.

Ainsworth died on 4 April 1743, at the age of 82, and was buried at St Matthias Old Church, Poplar, where an inscription in Latin verse, written by himself, was placed over his remains and those of his wife. One of the heirs of his estate was a nephew, Peter Ainsworth (born 1713), who used his uncle&#x27;s money to establish a successful bleach works at Halliwell in Bolton. He was the grandfather of Peter Ainsworth (1790–1870), a Whig politician.

==Works==
In 1736, after about twenty years&#x27; labour, Ainsworth published his major work, with a dedication to Richard Mead, and a preface explaining his reasons for undertaking it. Improved editions by Samuel Patrick, John Ward, William Young of Gillingham, Isaac Kimber (editing 1751) and Thomas Morell successively appeared; Ward and Young&#x27;s (1752) in folio, the others in quarto. Nathaniel Thomas&#x27;s version was from 1758. John Carey&#x27;s (1816) was a later version; there were also abridgments by Young and Morell. Another 19th-century edition was that of Benjamin Wrigglesworth Beatson with William Ellis, based on the 1752 edition.

Earlier, Ainsworth had published a treatise on education, entitled &quot;The most Natural and Easy Way of Institution&quot; (1698), in which he advocated the teaching of Latin by conversational methods and deprecates punishment of any sort. Ainsworth was author also &quot;Monumenta Vetustatis Kempiana&quot; (1720), an expansive account of the classical collection of John Kemp, of &quot;A Short Treatise on Grammar&quot;, and some smaller pieces. He is said to have been a hunter after old coins and other curiosities.

<text> (; , archaic , Transylvanian Saxon: , ) is the capital city of Bistrița-Năsăud County, in northern Transylvania, Romania. It is situated on the Bistrița River. The city has a population of 78,877 inhabitants as of 2021 and administers six villages: (; ), (; ), (; ), (; ), (until 1950 ; ; ) and (; ). There is a project for the creation of a metropolitan area that will contain the municipality of Bistrița and 3 surrounding localities (Șieu-Măgheruș, Budacu de Jos, and Livezile), whose combined population would be over 91,600 inhabitants.

==Etymology==
The town was named after the River, whose name comes from the Slavic word meaning &#x27;fast-moving water&#x27;.

==History==
The earliest sign of settlement in the area of is in Neolithic remains. The Turkic Pechenegs settled the area in 12th century following attacks of the Cumans. Transylvanian Saxons settled the area in 1206 and called the region . A large part of settlers were fugitives, convicts, and poor people looking for lands and opportunities. The destruction of (&quot;Market Nösen&quot;) under the Mongols of central Europe is described in a document from 1241. The city was then called . Situated on several trade routes, became a flourishing medieval trading post.

 became a free royal town in 1330. In 1353, King Louis I of Hungary granted the town the right to organize an annual 15-day fair on Saint Bartholomew day, as well as a seal containing the coat of arms of an ostrich with a horseshoe in its beak. The town developed markets throughout Moldavia, and its craftsmen travelled extensively. It was given the right to be surrounded by defensive walls in 1409. In 1465, the city&#x27;s fortifications had 18 defensive towers and bastions defended by the local guilds. It was also defended by a , or fortified church. In 1713 the Romanian population was expelled by the Saxon magistrates, but they returned later. The town was badly damaged by fire five times between 1836 and 1850. The church suffered from fire in 1857, when the tower&#x27;s roof and the bells were destroyed. The roof was rebuilt after several years. Fires in the nineteenth century also destroyed much of the city&#x27;s medieval citadel.

A Jewish community developed in after the prohibition on Jewish settlement there was lifted in 1848, organizing itself in the 1860s. The synagogue, consecrated in 1893, is among Transylvania&#x27;s largest and most impressive. The community was Orthodox with a strong Hasidic section, but there were also Jews who adopted German and Hungarian culture. A Zionist youth organization, , was founded in in 1901 by Nissan Kahan, who corresponded with Theodor Herzl and there was significant support for the Zionist movement in the town between the two world wars. A large yeshivah flourished under the direction of the rabbi of , Solomon Zalman Ullmann, between 1924 and 1942. During World War I, 138 Jews were conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian Army; 12 were killed in action.

The city was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until 1918. On December 1 that year, Transylvania united with Romania, and Romanian Army troops entered on December 5. In 1925, Bistrița became the capital of Năsăud County.

===World War II===
In the wake of the Second Vienna Award (August 1940), the city reverted to the Kingdom of Hungary. During the war, the Hungarian authorities deported several dozen Jewish families in 1941 from to Kamenets-Podolski in the Galician area of occupied Ukraine, where they were killed by Hungarian soldiers. The Jews of , as elsewhere in Hungary, were subjected to restrictions, and Jewish men of military age were drafted for forced labor service. In May 1944, the Jewish population was forced into the Bistrița ghetto, set up at Stamboli Farm, about two miles from the city. The ghetto consisted of a number of barracks and pigsties. At its peak, the ghetto held close to 6,000 Jews, including those brought in from the neighboring communities in Beszterce-Naszód County. Among these were the Jews of , , , , , , , , , and . The ghetto was liquidated with the deportation of its inhabitants to in two transports on June 2 and 6, 1944.

After King Michael&#x27;s Coup of August 1944, Romania switched sides to the Allies. By October of that year, Romanian and Soviet troops gained control of all of Northern Transylvania, which was reintegrated into Romania in March 1945. In 1950, Bistrița became the seat of ; in 1952, the region was dissolved and the city became the seat of Bistrița raion (part of Cluj Region) until 1968.

===Recent events===
On June 11, 2008, the tower and roof of the church caught fire when three children who went to steal copper set it on fire while playing. The main part of the church suffered only slight damage, the interior remaining intact. It is speculated that both of the tower&#x27;s bells, one dating from the 15th century, the other from the 17th, may have melted in the blaze.

<text>In mathematics, computer science, and logic, rewriting covers a wide range of methods of replacing subterms of a formula with other terms. Such methods may be achieved by rewriting systems (also known as rewrite systems, rewrite engines, or reduction systems). In their most basic form, they consist of a set of objects, plus relations on how to transform those objects.

Rewriting can be non-deterministic. One rule to rewrite a term could be applied in many different ways to that term, or more than one rule could be applicable. Rewriting systems then do not provide an algorithm for changing one term to another, but a set of possible rule applications. When combined with an appropriate algorithm, however, rewrite systems can be viewed as computer programs, and several theorem provers and declarative programming languages are based on term rewriting.

== Example cases ==
=== Logic ===
In logic, the procedure for obtaining the conjunctive normal form (CNF) of a formula can be implemented as a rewriting system. The rules of an example of such a system would be:

:formula_1 (double negation elimination)
:formula_2 (De Morgan&#x27;s laws)
:formula_3
:formula_4 (distributivity)
:formula_5
where the symbol (formula_6) indicates that an expression matching the left hand side of the rule can be rewritten to one formed by the right hand side, and the symbols each denote a subexpression. In such a system, each rule is chosen so that the left side is equivalent to the right side, and consequently when the left side matches a subexpression, performing a rewrite of that subexpression from left to right maintains logical consistency and value of the entire expression.

=== Arithmetic ===
Term rewriting systems can be employed to compute arithmetic operations on natural numbers.
To this end, each such number has to be encoded as a term.
The simplest encoding is the one used in the Peano axioms, based on the constant 0 (zero) and the successor function &quot;S&quot;. For example, the numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3 are represented by the terms 0, S(0), S(S(0)), and S(S(S(0))), respectively.
The following term rewriting system can then be used to compute sum and product of given natural numbers.

: formula_7

For example, the computation of 2+2 to result in 4 can be duplicated by term rewriting as follows:
:formula_8 formula_9 formula_10 formula_11 formula_12 formula_13 formula_14
where the rule numbers are given above the &quot;rewrites-to&quot; arrow.

As another example, the computation of 2⋅2 looks like:
:formula_15 formula_16 formula_17 formula_18 formula_19 formula_20 formula_21 formula_13 formula_8 formula_24 formula_14
where the last step comprises the previous example computation.

=== Linguistics ===
In linguistics, phrase structure rules, also called rewrite rules, are used in some systems of generative grammar, as a means of generating the grammatically correct sentences of a language. Such a rule typically takes the form formula_26, where A is a syntactic category label, such as noun phrase or sentence, and X is a sequence of such labels or morphemes, expressing the fact that A can be replaced by X in generating the constituent structure of a sentence. For example, the rule formula_27 means that a sentence can consist of a noun phrase (NP) followed by a verb phrase (VP); further rules will specify what sub-constituents a noun phrase and a verb phrase can consist of, and so on.

== Abstract rewriting systems ==
From the above examples, it is clear that we can think of rewriting systems in an abstract manner. We need to specify a set of objects and the rules that can be applied to transform them. The most general (unidimensional) setting of this notion is called an &quot;abstract reduction system&quot; or &quot;abstract rewriting system&quot; (abbreviated &quot;ARS&quot;). An ARS is simply a set &quot;A&quot; of objects, together with a binary relation → on &quot;A&quot; called the &quot;reduction relation&quot;, &quot;rewrite relation&quot; or just &quot;reduction&quot;.

Many notions and notations can be defined in the general setting of an ARS. formula_28 is the reflexive transitive closure of formula_29. formula_30 is the symmetric closure of formula_29. formula_32 is the reflexive transitive symmetric closure of formula_29. The word problem for an ARS is determining, given &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, whether formula_34. An object &quot;x&quot; in &quot;A&quot; is called &quot;reducible&quot; if there exists some other &quot;y&quot; in &quot;A&quot; such that formula_35; otherwise it is called &quot;irreducible&quot; or a normal form. An object &quot;y&quot; is called a &quot;normal form of &quot;x&quot;&quot; if formula_36, and &quot;y&quot; is irreducible. If the normal form of &quot;x&quot; is unique, then this is usually denoted with formula_37. If every object has at least one normal form, the ARS is called &quot;normalizing&quot;. formula_38 or &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are said to be &quot;joinable&quot; if there exists some &quot;z&quot; with the property that formula_39. An ARS is said to possess the Church–Rosser property if formula_34 implies formula_38. An ARS is confluent if for all &quot;w&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;A&quot;, formula_42 implies formula_38. An ARS is &quot;locally confluent&quot; if and only if for all &quot;w&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;A&quot;, formula_44 implies formula_45. An ARS is said to be &quot;terminating&quot; or &quot;noetherian&quot; if there is no infinite chain formula_46. A confluent and terminating ARS is called &quot;convergent&quot; or &quot;canonical&quot;.

Important theorems for abstract rewriting systems are that an ARS is confluent iff it has the Church–Rosser property, Newman&#x27;s lemma (a terminating ARS is confluent if and only if it is locally confluent), and that the word problem for an ARS is undecidable in general.

== String rewriting systems ==
A &quot;string rewriting system&quot; (SRS), also known as &quot;semi-Thue system&quot;, exploits the free monoid structure of the strings (words) over an alphabet to extend a rewriting relation, formula_47, to &quot;all&quot; strings in the alphabet that contain left- and respectively right-hand sides of some rules as substrings. Formally a semi-Thue system is a tuple formula_48 where formula_49 is a (usually finite) alphabet, and formula_47 is a binary relation between some (fixed) strings in the alphabet, called the set of &quot;rewrite rules&quot;. The &quot;one-step rewriting relation&quot; formula_51 induced by formula_47 on formula_53 is defined as: if formula_54 are any strings, then formula_55 if there exist formula_56 such that formula_57, formula_58, and formula_59. Since formula_51 is a relation on formula_53, the pair formula_62 fits the definition of an abstract rewriting system. Since the empty string is in formula_53, formula_47 is a subset of formula_51. If the relation formula_47 is symmetric, then the system is called a &quot;Thue system&quot;.

In a SRS, the reduction relation formula_67 is compatible with the monoid operation, meaning that formula_68 implies formula_69 for all strings formula_56. Similarly, the reflexive transitive symmetric closure of formula_51, denoted formula_72, is a congruence, meaning it is an equivalence relation (by definition) and it is also compatible with string concatenation. The relation formula_73 is called the &quot;Thue congruence&quot; generated by formula_47. In a Thue system, i.e. if formula_47 is symmetric, the rewrite relation formula_67 coincides with the Thue congruence formula_72.

The notion of a semi-Thue system essentially coincides with the presentation of a monoid. Since formula_72 is a congruence, we can define the factor monoid formula_79 of the free monoid formula_53 by the Thue congruence. If a monoid formula_81 is isomorphic with formula_82, then the semi-Thue system formula_48 is called a monoid presentation of formula_81.

We immediately get some very useful connections with other areas of algebra. For example, the alphabet formula_85 with the rules formula_86, where formula_87 is the empty string, is a presentation of the free group on one generator. If instead the rules are just formula_88, then we obtain a presentation of the bicyclic monoid. Thus semi-Thue systems constitute a natural framework for solving the word problem for monoids and groups. In fact, every monoid has a presentation of the form formula_48, i.e. it may always be presented by a semi-Thue system, possibly over an infinite alphabet.

The word problem for a semi-Thue system is undecidable in general; this result is sometimes known as the &quot;Post–Markov theorem&quot;.

== Term rewriting systems ==

A term rewriting system (TRS) is a rewriting system whose objects are &quot;terms&quot;, which are expressions with nested sub-expressions. For example, the system shown under &quot;&quot; above is a term rewriting system. The terms in this system are composed of binary operators formula_90 and formula_91 and the unary operator formula_92. Also present in the rules are variables, which represent any possible term (though a single variable always represents the same term throughout a single rule).

In contrast to string rewriting systems, whose objects are sequences of symbols, the objects of a term rewriting system form a term algebra. A term can be visualized as a tree of symbols, the set of admitted symbols being fixed by a given signature. As a formalism, term rewriting systems have the full power of Turing machines, that is, every computable function can be defined by a term rewriting system.

Some programming languages are based on term rewriting. One such example is Pure, a functional programming language for mathematical applications. 

===Formal definition ===

A &quot;rewrite rule&quot; is a pair of terms, commonly written as formula_93, to indicate that the left-hand side can be replaced by the right-hand side . A &quot;term rewriting system&quot; is a set of such rules. A rule formula_93 can be &quot;applied&quot; to a term if the left term matches some subterm of , that is, if there is some substitution formula_95 such that the subterm of formula_96 rooted at some position is the result of applying the substitution formula_95 to the term . The subterm matching the left hand side of the rule is called a redex or reducible expression. The result term of this rule application is then the result of replacing the subterm at position in by the term formula_98 with the substitution formula_95 applied, see picture 1. In this case, formula_96 is said to be &quot;rewritten in one step&quot;, or &quot;rewritten directly&quot;, to formula_101 by the system formula_47, formally denoted as formula_103, formula_104, or as formula_105 by some authors.

If a term formula_106 can be rewritten in several steps into a term formula_107, that is, if formula_108, the term formula_106 is said to be &quot;rewritten&quot; to formula_107, formally denoted as formula_111. In other words, the relation formula_112 is the transitive closure of the relation formula_51; often, also the notation formula_67 is used to denote the reflexive-transitive closure of formula_51, that is, formula_116 if formula_117 or A term rewriting given by a set formula_47 of rules can be viewed as an abstract rewriting system as defined above, with terms as its objects and formula_51 as its rewrite relation.

For example, formula_120 is a rewrite rule, commonly used to establish a normal form with respect to the associativity of formula_121.
That rule can be applied at the numerator in the term formula_122 with the matching substitution formula_123, see picture 2. Applying that substitution to the rule&#x27;s right-hand side yields the term formula_124, and replacing the numerator by that term yields formula_125, which is the result term of applying the rewrite rule. Altogether, applying the rewrite rule has achieved what is called &quot;applying the associativity law for formula_121 to formula_122&quot; in elementary algebra. Alternately, the rule could have been applied to the denominator of the original term, yielding formula_128.

===Termination===
Termination issues of rewrite systems in general are handled in &quot;Abstract rewriting system#Termination and convergence&quot;. For term rewriting systems in particular, the following additional subtleties are to be considered.

Termination even of a system consisting of one rule with a linear left-hand side is undecidable. Termination is also undecidable for systems using only unary function symbols; however, it is decidable for finite ground systems.

The following term rewrite system is normalizing, but not terminating, and not confluent:
formula_129

The following two examples of terminating term rewrite systems are due to Toyama: 
:formula_130 
and 
:formula_131
:formula_132

Their union is a non-terminating system, since

formula_133
This result disproves a conjecture of Dershowitz, who claimed that the union of two terminating term rewrite systems formula_134 and formula_135 is again terminating if all left-hand sides of formula_134 and right-hand sides of formula_135 are linear, and there are no &quot;overlaps&quot; between left-hand sides of formula_134 and right-hand sides of formula_135. All these properties are satisfied by Toyama&#x27;s examples.

See Rewrite order and Path ordering (term rewriting) for ordering relations used in termination proofs for term rewriting systems.

=== Higher-order rewriting systems ===

Higher-order rewriting systems are a generalization of first-order term rewriting systems to lambda terms, allowing higher order functions and bound variables. Various results about first-order TRSs can be reformulated for HRSs as well.

=== Graph rewriting systems ===

Graph rewrite systems are another generalization of term rewrite systems, operating on graphs instead of (ground-) terms / their corresponding tree representation.

== Trace rewriting systems ==
Trace theory provides a means for discussing multiprocessing in more formal terms, such as via the trace monoid and the history monoid. Rewriting can be performed in trace systems as well.

<text>Eric Bogle (born 23 September 1944) is an Australian folk singer-songwriter. Born and raised in Scotland, he emigrated to Australia at the age of 25 to settle near Adelaide, South Australia. Bogle&#x27;s songs have covered a variety of topics and have been performed by many artists. Two of his best known songs are &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; (or &quot;The Green Fields of France&quot;) and &quot;And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda&quot;, with the latter named one of the APRA Top 30 Australian songs in 2001 as part of the celebrations for the Australasian Performing Right Association&#x27;s 75th anniversary.

==Early years==
Eric Bogle was born on 23 September 1944 in Peebles, Scotland. His father was a railway signalman who played the bagpipes. Bogle started writing poetry when he was eight years old. After attending school until he was sixteen, he worked in various trades: labourer, clerk and barman. In 1969, he emigrated to Australia and initially lived in the capital, Canberra, where he worked as an accountant. He had an interest in politics and by 1980 had moved to Queensland before settling in Adelaide.

== Career ==

Bogle taught himself to play guitar and joined a skiffle and rock band. He was the leader of Eric and the Informers in Scotland. His early influences were Lonnie Donegan, Elvis Presley and Ewan MacColl. He turned to folk music prior to emigrating to Australia – his first written songs concerned his parents. One of these, &quot;Leaving Nancy&quot;, which sang of the day he left home for Australia, being the last time he saw his mother Nancy, was often covered, most notably by the Dubliners and the Fureys. When living in Canberra he joined the local folk music scene and performed occasionally.

Several of his most famous songs tell of the futility or loss of war. Prominent among these is &quot;And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda&quot;, written in 1971, later covered by Joan Baez, The Pogues and many more. The lyrics recount the experiences of a member of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) in the Battle of Gallipoli. It has also been interpreted as a reaction to the Vietnam War.

Another of his best-known songs, &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, is also World War I-themed. This song is commonly known as &quot;The Green Fields of France&quot;, a title it was first given by the Fureys and which has subsequently been used in many further cover versions. The song refers to the traditional Scottish song &quot;Flowers of the Forest&quot; being played over the grave of a World War I soldier. Bogle deliberately gave the dead soldier an Irish name (&quot;Willie McBride&quot;) as a counter to the anti-Irish sentiment prevalent in Britain during the 1970s. The song has been covered by Alex Beaton (with &quot;A Scottish Soldier&quot; from &quot;The Water is Wide&quot;), Plethyn (&quot;Gwaed ar eu Dwylo&quot; (Blood on their Hands), sung in Welsh from &quot;Blas y Pridd&quot;), Hannes Wader (&quot;Es ist an der Zeit&quot; (It is the Time)), and Dutch folk band Wolverlei as &quot;14-18&quot;. American folk singer Charlie Zahm also has a version on his album &quot;Festival Favorites&quot;, as does American folk singer Robert Marr on his 2011 album &quot;Celticism&quot;. The lyrics from the song were referred to by former British prime minister Tony Blair in 2003 as his favourite anti-war poem.

&quot;As if he Knows&quot; (2001) widens the theme of the wastage of war to describe the sadness of Australian mounted soldiers in Palestine in 1918 as they are obliged to shoot their horses, &quot;who asked so little and gave so much&quot;, before embarkation.

Another notable song on a similar theme, but with a more contemporary setting, is the Troubles-inspired &quot;My Youngest Son Came Home Today&quot;, with its tale of a young man killed during fighting in Northern Ireland. Notably, the song does not take sides in the conflict; it does not mention whether the title character is a nationalist or loyalist. However, the song has been adopted by Nationalists and is now associated with Irish Republicanism. When Billy Bragg covered the song, he changed the line &quot;dreams of &quot;freedom&quot; unfulfilled&quot; (which echoes the language of Nationalists) to &quot;dreams of &quot;glory&quot; unfulfilled&quot;. 

Bogle&#x27;s songs cover a wide range of subjects and themes, including comedic songs (&quot;The Aussie Bar-B-Q&quot;), satires (&quot;I Hate Wogs&quot;), protest songs and serious songs about the human condition such as &quot;Now I&#x27;m Easy&quot;. His song &quot;Safe in the Harbour&quot; is an homage to Stan Rogers. &quot;Katie and the Dreamtime Land&quot; is a tribute to American folk singer Kate Wolf, who died from leukemia in 1986. Other well-known songs, with lighter subject matter, include two homages to departed pets, &quot;Little Gomez&quot; and &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Moggy Now&quot; and an acknowledgment of his folk music fans with &quot;Do You Sing Any Dylan?&quot;.

In 2000 a five-CD collection, &quot;Singing The Spirit Home&quot;, was released. His first and only live performance DVD was released in May 2009.

==Touring==

Bogle has undertaken an extensive concert tour of the UK (sometimes including appearances in continental Europe as well), every three years since 1985. These tours have usually included a supporting cast of Australian-based singers and musicians, most regularly John Munro and Brent Miller. Bogle said that his 2009 tour, with John Munro, would be his last overseas tour. This featured a &quot;Saturday Night Special&quot; on 27 June with Martyn Wyndham-Read, Johnny Collins and Les Sullivan in Watford, the closest venue to London.

More recent tours in Australia have included Adelaide-based musicians Emma Luker (fiddle) and Pete Titchener (guitar/bass)

Bogle was a prominent artist at the National Folk Festival in Canberra over Easter 2011 as well as a regular artist at the Port Fairy Folk Festival held in Port Fairy, Victoria, every March.

Many of Bogle&#x27;s songs have been covered by other artists; including Joan Baez, John Schumann, Donovan, the Skids, June Tabor, the Men They Couldn&#x27;t Hang, the Clancy Brothers, the Dubliners, John McDermott, Liam Clancy, Mike Harding, the Pogues, De Dannan, Dropkick Murphys, the Corries, Billy Bragg, the Bushwackers, Slim Dusty, Mary Black, the Fureys, and John Williamson. In May 2001 the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th anniversary celebrations, named his song &quot;And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda&quot; as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time.

<text>Ovria (, also: Οβρυά - &quot;Ovrya&quot;) is a town in Achaea, Greece. It is a suburb of Patras, located 6 km south of Patras city centre. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Patras, of which it is a community. Between 1997 and 2011, it was the seat of the former municipality of Messatida. The Greek National Roads 9 (Patras - Pyrgos) and 33 (Patras - Tripoli) pass through the town. Ovria is in the transition zone from the densely populated coastal area to the hills in the southeast, including Omplos. Agriculture (olive groves, pastures) is still the dominant land use in the areas south and east of Ovria. Neighboring communities are Demenika to the northeast, Mintilogli to the west, Krini to the east, and Kallithea to the south.

<text>Spyro Gyra is an American jazz fusion band that was formed in Buffalo, New York, in 1974. The band&#x27;s music combines jazz, R&amp;B, funk, and pop music. The band&#x27;s name comes from &quot;Spirogyra&quot;, a genus of green algae which founder Jay Beckenstein had learned about in college.

==History==
===Early years===
Saxophonist Jay Beckenstein and keyboardist Jeremy Wall formed a band with jazz and rock musicians who were playing in the Buffalo bar and club circuit. In 1974, when a bar owner asked for the band&#x27;s name, Beckenstein said, &quot;spirogyra&quot;, a type of algae he had learned about in school. The bar owner wrote the name incorrectly, &quot;Spyro Gyra&quot;, but it stuck. The founding members of the band were Beckenstein, Wall, bassist Jim Kurzdorfer, drummer Tom Walsh, and keyboardist Tom Schuman. In 1977, they released &quot;Spyro Gyra&quot; independently before making a deal with Amherst Records, which re-released the album with a different cover. It included &quot;Shaker Song,&quot; which reached No. 90 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100, No. 99 on the pop chart in Canada, and No. 26 on the Canadian AC chart. Jay Beckenstein and Richard Calandra co-produced the record, while Beckenstein and Wall each wrote an equal number of compositions. After the success of &quot;Shaker Song,&quot; the band went on tour in 1978 with a lineup including Beckenstein on sax, Wall and Schuman on keyboards, Kurzdorfer on bass, Freddy Rapillo on guitar, Eli Konikoff on drums and Gerardo Velez on percussion.

The band&#x27;s second album &quot;Morning Dance&quot; reached No. 11 in the UK Albums Chart, No. 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 albums chart, and No. 47 in Canada. The song &quot;Morning Dance&quot; reached No. 17 in the UK Singles Chart, No. 1 on the US Adult Contemporary singles chart, No. 45 on the Canadian pop charts, and No. 6 on the Canadian AC charts. The album was certified gold in 1979, then platinum in 1987 by the RIAA. In addition to the band, the album featured guest musicians including trumpet player Randy Brecker, saxophonist Michael Brecker, guitarists John Tropea and Hiram Bullock, bassist Will Lee, drummer Steve Jordan and percussionist Rubens Bassini. Drummer Ted Reinhardt and guitarist Rick Strauss were in the band lineup during recording, but by the album&#x27;s completion Chet Catallo joined on guitar. Jeremy Wall left the touring lineup but would continue to compose for the band. The sextet of Beckenstein, Schuman, Catallo, Kurzdorfer, Konikoff and Velez became the band&#x27;s touring lineup in 1979, continuing into 1980.

===1980s===
When Infinity Records folded, &quot;Catching the Sun&quot; was released on MCA in February 1980, becoming the No. 4 jazz album of 1980, peaking at No. 31 in the UK, and No. 80 in Canada. This album included the first composition for the group by Tom Schuman, who would become a regular writer along with Beckenstein and Wall, while other band members also contributed compositions. Bassist Jim Kurzdorfer left the group in 1980, replaced by David Wofford, and for a tour of Japan Sheila Escovedo temporarily replaced Velez on percussion. The group released their next album, &quot;Carnaval&quot;, in late 1980. &quot;Catching the Sun&quot; was certified gold in 1985 by the RIAA, followed in 1987 by &quot;Carnaval.&quot; The group&#x27;s next release was &quot;Freetime&quot;, in 1981.

&quot;Incognito&quot; (1982) featured as guests bassist Marcus Miller, drummer Steve Gadd, saxophonist Tom Scott, pianist Richard Tee, harmonica player Toots Thielemans, and pianist Jorge Dalto. &quot;City Kids&quot; (1983) introduced bassist Kim Stone, replacing Wofford. It was the first Spyro Gyra album recorded at BearTracks Studios, a studio in Suffern, NY established by Beckenstein in 1982.

The live album &quot;Access All Areas&quot;, recorded in Florida in November 1983, introduced marimba and vibraphone player Dave Samuels (who had guested on earlier tracks including the hits &quot;Shaker Song&quot; and &quot;Morning Dance&quot;) as a full-time member of the band. After this album, Eli Konikoff and Chet Catallo left the group, to be replaced by drummer Richie Morales and guitarist Julio Fernández.

The new lineup (Beckenstein, Schuman, Fernández, Samuels, Stone, Morales and Velez) recorded 1985&#x27;s &quot;Alternating Currents&quot;, the band&#x27;s first studio album to feature only the core lineup with no guest musicians. After percussionist Manolo Badrena, formerly of Weather Report and a previous guest musician on Spyro Gyra&#x27;s albums, joined the band as a full-time member, replacing Velez, the group released the 1986 follow-up &quot;Breakout&quot;. &quot;Alternating Currents&quot; (1985) and &quot;Breakout&quot; (1986) would be among the top 15 Jazz Albums in Billboard in 1986. Longtime co-producer Richard Calandra died in October 1986 of pancreatic cancer.

In 1987, Roberto Vally replaced Stone on bass for &quot;Stories Without Words&quot;, which would also be Manolo Badrena&#x27;s final album with the band. &quot;Rites of Summer&quot; (1988) introduced bassist Oscar Cartaya, replacing Vally. Both &quot;Stories Without Words&quot; and &quot;Rites of Summer&quot; were among Billboard&#x27;s top 15 Contemporary Jazz Albums of 1988. On the 1989 album &quot;Point of View&quot; Julio Fernández was replaced by guitarist Jay Azzolina. Spyro Gyra ended the decade as Billboard&#x27;s most successful jazz artist of the 1980s.

===1990s===

Percussionist Marc Quiñones joined the group for &quot;Fast Forward&quot; (1990), though it would be his only album as a band member, and the last album for Richie Morales and Jay Azzolina. In 1990 the group performed temporarily without a guitarist, and with Tony Cintron replacing Morales on drums. Guitarist Julio Fernández rejoined the band for two new tracks included on the &quot;best of&quot; album, &quot;Collection&quot;, which also marked the debut of drummer Joel Rosenblatt.

&quot;Three Wishes&quot; (1992) introduced bassist Scott Ambush, replacing Cartaya. The following year&#x27;s &quot;Dreams Beyond Control&quot; included guest appearances by former Santana vocalist Alex Ligertwood, marking the first appearance of lyrics on a Spyro Gyra album. After this album, Dave Samuels left the band to pursue solo projects, although he would guest with the band on later albums.

In 1995, the band released &quot;Love and Other Obsessions&quot; with guests Deniece Williams, Barrington Henderson, Billy Cliff, and a host of other backing vocalists and musicians, including Dave Samuels. This album would be the band&#x27;s final 90&#x27;s release to feature traditional R&amp;B vocals. It was the first of a series of albums with the quintet lineup of Beckenstein, Schuman, Fernández, Ambush and Rosenblatt, which lasted until 2004.

===Recent years===
Drummer Joel Rosenblatt left the band during the making of &quot;The Deep End&quot;, leaving room for two other drummers, guest Billy Kilson and Ludwig Afonso, who became Rosenblatt&#x27;s replacement. The band&#x27;s next album, 2006&#x27;s &quot;Wrapped in a Dream,&quot; was the first Spyro Gyra album since 1990&#x27;s &quot;Fast Forward&quot; to be nominated for a Grammy Award. It would be the band&#x27;s final album recorded at BearTracks Studios, which Beckenstein closed in 2006. Trinidadian Bonny Bonaparte (Bonny B) replaced Afonso as drummer for &quot;Good to Go-Go&quot; (2007), which received a Grammy nomination, as did &quot;A Night Before Christmas&quot; and &quot;Down the Wire&quot; (2009).

&quot;A Foreign Affair&quot; was released in 2011 and included Beckenstein, Schuman, Fernández, Ambush, and Bonny B, as well as guest vocalists Arijit Singh and Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27;. The album debuted at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; jazz album chart. Bonaparte left the group due to health issues in November 2011 and was replaced on drums by Lee Pearson.

&quot;The Rhinebeck Sessions&quot; (2013) included Beckenstein, Schuman, Fernandez, Ambush, and Pearson. According to the group, it was written and recorded over three days in a recording studio in Rhinebeck, New York. In 2015, there was another change of drummers with Lionel Cordew replacing Pearson. &quot;Vinyl Tap&quot; (2019), the band&#x27;s most recent record to date, was a departure as it had no original material, instead featuring the band&#x27;s interpretations of classic rock and r&amp;b songs from the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s.

In 2020, with the band forced to stop touring due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the band uploaded a video to YouTube on June 23, 2020, featuring a medley of early hits &quot;Shaker Song,&quot; &quot;Catching the Sun&quot; and &quot;Morning Dance&quot; synchronized from recordings of each band member at home. In 2021, the group resumed touring.

On December 19, 2022, the band announced on Facebook that Tom Schuman planned to move to Europe and would play his final shows with the band in February 2023. On December 28, 2022, the band announced that Chris Fischer would be their new keyboardist starting in March 2023.

In 2024, the group toured in celebration of its 50th anniversary.

<text>Hesdin (; ) is a former commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in northern France. On 1 January 2025, it was merged into the new commune of Hesdin-la-Forêt.

==Geography==
The N39, from Arras to Montreuil, used to be the main thoroughfare of the town. In the 1950s, a circular route was created to help traffic flow. A second bypass was built in the 1980s, taking all through traffic well away from the town centre.

The Canche river flows through the centre of Hesdin.

==History==

Hesdin was a fief of the counts of Artois, vassals of the Counts of Flanders until 1180. When Philip, count of Flanders gave Artois as dowry to his niece Isabella of Hainault when she married Philip Augustus of France in 1180, Hesdin and the other seigneuries passed to France.

At the end of the 11th century, Hesdin gained renown for the park and chateau of Robert II, Count of Artois, which featured the earliest examples of early medieval automata in Europe. These included mechanical monkeys covered in badger fur, mechanized fountains, a large sundial surrounded by lions and leopards, and a bellows-operated organ. Over the years additional automata were added, including creations such as a mechanical king and an indoor fountain with mechanical birds. Guillaume de Machaut, in his poem &quot;Le Remede de Fortune&quot;, characterized them as &quot;the marvels, the delights, the inventions, the engines, the contrivances, the water courses, the strange things that were enclosed there.&quot; By the 1380s, the automata had fallen into disrepair, until Philip the Good renovated them again in the 1430s. A 1433 bill of account recounts numerous mechanical amusements, including machines that played pranks on the guests as well as angels and figures that spoke and directed visitors.

Though subsequently the territory passed to the Dukes of Burgundy, Hesdin remained one of a handful of French strongholds, until in 1553 Emperor Charles V ordered the utter destruction of the old fortified town on a rise of ground and built the present town the following year, some from the original site, on the banks of the Canche. The unfortified village of Vieil-Hesdin was later built on the original site.

In 1639 the French laid siege to Hesdin and under Louis XIII, it was recaptured for France. Thus, though Hesdin has an ancient name and 16th century structures, there is nothing left of the medieval town.

During World War II, the town was occupied by Germany. The SS operated a subcamp of the V SS construction brigade, in which mostly Soviet and Polish prisoners were subjected to slave labour. In August 1944, due to Allied advance, the Germans dissolved the subcamp and deported its prisoners to subcamps of the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. In 1975, a memorial plaque and a small museum was established at the site of the subcamp.

In 2014 Hesdin elected a 22-year-old law student, Stéphane Sieczkowski-Samier, as Mayor. Sieczkowski-Samier became the youngest mayor in France and is nicknamed &quot;Petit Sarko&quot; (little Sarkozy) in the French press as a reference to the previous French President Nicolas Sarkozy who is from the same political party.

==Population==
==Places of interest==

Hesdin is dominated by the central square, the &quot;Place d&#x27;Armes&quot; overlooked by the 16th-17th-century town hall. The town hall, with its large belfry, was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005 as part of the Belfries of Belgium and France site, because of its historical importance as the center of municipal power within the region. The contemporary Church of Notre Dame was begun in 1565 and completed in 1685.

==Notable people==
* Ernulf de Hesdin (died 1097–8), important Domesday landholder and participant in the First Crusade.

==Events==
Thursday is market day in Hesdin, when a large range of local produce and more typical inexpensive market items can be purchased from the stalls in the surrounding streets.

In the first two weeks of August the town has the fete of the Cochon Rose (Pink Piglet) which includes a variety of events including a Sunday Brocante (flea market) which is the biggest in the region.

<doc id="415857" wikidata="Q2087422" url="?curid=415857" title="Itsuo Tsuda">
<text>was a Japanese philosopher and a practitioner and teacher of aikido and Seitai.

Tsuda was born in Japanese-ruled Korea. When he was 16 years old, he defied his father, who wished for his eldest son to remain home and manage his family&#x27;s estate. He left his family home and begin wandering, searching for new philosophies that would free his mind.

Having reconciled with his father, in 1934 he went to France, where he studied with Marcel Granet and Marcel Mauss until 1940, when he went back Japan: he studied Noh with Hosada, Seitai with Haruchika Noguchi and aikido with Morihei Ueshiba.
In 1970 Itsuo Tsuda came back to Europe to disseminate the regenerative movement (or katsugen undō 活元運動, かつげんうんどう, a basic Seitai practice) and his ideas on Ki. In 1973 he published his first book, &quot;Le Non-Faire&quot; while waiting to open his first dōjō, in Paris, L&#x27;Ecole de la Respiration (also the title of his series of books).

He died in Paris in 1984, but his practical philosophy is left in his work and his books and taught in several European &quot;School of Breathing&quot; dōjōs.

<text>Laventie (; ) is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Hauts-de-France region of France.

==Geography==
A small farming and light industrial town, situated some northeast of Béthune and west of Lille, at the junction of the D166, D173 and D174 roads. Famous for its cherries.

==History==

In World War I, like other settlements in Pas-de-Calais, Laventie was heavily fought over between German and Allied forces. From 1915, there was constant underground fighting in the area, in which units like the 173rd, 3rd Australian and 255th Tunnelling Companies RE were involved. Laventie is the title of a poem by the war poet and composer Ivor Gurney.

The artist Eric Kennington was stationed at Laventie with his unit, the 1/13th Battalion, London Regiment (Kensington), in the winter of 1914–15. After being wounded and evacuated he painted members of his platoon in the snowy village street. The painting, &quot;The Kensingtons at Laventie&quot;, considered by many to be his most important work, is in the collection of the Imperial War Museum, London.

The engineer and inventor of the Hortag agricultural spade, A S Bullock, also recalls action at Laventie in a posthumously published memoir (written in the 1970s). In particular he recalls how the area near the old fortifications was defended not by trenches (because the water table was too high) but by barbed wire entanglements, and he recounts the experience of being ordered to march across this barbed wire and take up position in a former distillery, as well as subsequently volunteering for the near-impossible task of returning to the battalion alone and taking a message back to the platoon during the night.

<text>Lillers (; ) is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Hauts-de-France region of France about 15 km northwest of Béthune and 40 km west of Lille. The river Clarence flows through the town.

==History==
After being owned by the Counts of Flanders, Lillers, which had been fortified against the Normans was given as a dowry in 1179 to King Philip II Augustus of France. In 1327, Artois was created a county by Louis IX. His brother Robert became the first Count. In 1303, the city of Lillers was looted by the Flemings. In 1340, King Edward III of England claimed the throne of France and started the Hundred Years War, marked by two famous battles, that of Crécy 1346 and that of Battle of Agincourt, 1415, where Robert Wavrin, Lord of Lillers, met his death. In 1542, during the war against Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, French troops burned Lillers. The population were still living in tents or huts three years later.

After a period of peace, the Thirty Years&#x27; War caused devastation in the region. In 1637, the town was taken by Marshall de la Ferté for Spain. In 1639, it was won back by Marshall de la Meilleraye to become French again. The Spanish retook it, only to be beaten off by the French in 1657. In 1659, the Treaty of the Pyrenees was concluded, which ceded most of the Artois to France, except Saint-Omer and Aire-sur-la-Lys.

In 1710, the region was the scene of the War of Spanish Succession. In 1710, Lillers was taken by Spanish troops. The allied British, German and Dutch forces under the command of the Duke of Marlborough established their headquarters at Lillers until forced out by the Marquis de Goesbriand, the head of the French troops.

The Treaty of Utrecht ended the war in 1713, when Lillers found itself a part of France. The still thriving shoe industries of Lillers started in the 19th century.

<doc id="415870" wikidata="Q190992" url="?curid=415870" title="Iberians">
<text>The Iberians (, from , &quot;Iberes&quot;) were an ancient people settled in the eastern and southern coasts of the Iberian Peninsula, at least from the 6th century BCE. They are described in Greek and Roman sources (among others, by Hecataeus of Miletus, Avienius, Herodotus and Strabo). Roman sources also use the term Hispani to refer to the Iberians.

The term &quot;Iberian&quot;, as used by the ancient authors, had two distinct meanings. One, more general, referred to all the populations of the Iberian peninsula without regard to ethnic differences (Pre-Indo-European, Celts and non-Celtic Indo-Europeans). The other, more restricted ethnic sense and the one dealt with in this article, refers to the people living in the eastern and southern coasts of the Iberian Peninsula, which by the 6th century BCE had absorbed cultural influences from the Phoenicians and the Greeks. This pre-Indo-European cultural group spoke the Iberian language from the 7th to at least the 1st century BCE. The rest of the peninsula, in the northern, central, and northwestern areas, was inhabited by Vascones, Celts or Celtiberians groups and the possibly Pre-Celtic or Proto-Celtic Indo-European Lusitanians, Vettones, and Turdetani.

Starting in the 5th century BCE, Iberian soldiers were frequently deployed in battles in Italy, Greece and especially Sicily due to their military qualities.

== History ==
The Iberian culture developed from the 6th century BCE, and perhaps as early as the fifth to the third millennium BCE in the eastern and southern coasts of the Iberian peninsula. The Iberians lived in villages and oppida (fortified settlements) and their communities were based on a tribal organization. The Iberians in the Spanish Levant were more urbanized than their neighbors in the central and northwestern regions of the Iberian peninsula. The peoples in the central and northwest regions were mostly speakers of Celtic dialects, semi-pastoral and lived in scattered villages, though they also had a few fortified towns like Numantia. They had a knowledge of 
writing, metalworking, including bronze, and agricultural techniques.

===Settlements===

In the centuries preceding Carthaginian and Roman conquest, Iberian settlements grew in social complexity, exhibiting evidence of social stratification and urbanization. This process was probably aided by trading contacts with the Phoenicians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. By the late 5th and early 4th centuries BCE a series of important social changes led to the consolidation of an aristocracy and the emergence of a clientele system. &quot;This new political system led, among other things, to cities and towns that centered around these leaders, also known as territorial nucleation. In this context, the oppidum or fortified Iberian town became the centre of reference in the landscape and the political space.&quot;

The settlement of &quot;Castellet de Banyoles&quot; in Tivissa was one of the most important ancient Iberian settlements in the north eastern part of the Iberian peninsula that was discovered in 1912. Also, the &#x27;Treasure of Tivissa&#x27;, a unique collection of silver Iberian votive offerings was found here in 1927.

Lucentum was another ancient Iberian settlement, as well as Castelldefels Castle.

Mausoleum of Pozo Moro near the town of Chinchilla de Monte-Aragón in Castile-La Mancha seems to mark the location of another big settlement.

Sagunto is the location of an ancient Iberian and later Roman city of Saguntum, where a big fortress was built in the 5th century BCE.

Greek colonists made the first historical reference to the Iberians in the 6th century BCE. They defined Iberians as non-Celtic peoples south of the Ebro river (Iber). The Greeks also dubbed as &quot;Iberians&quot; another people in the Caucasus region, currently known as Caucasian Iberians. It is thought that there is no connection between the two peoples.

The Iberians traded extensively with other Mediterranean cultures. Iberian pottery and metalwork has been found in France, Italy, and North Africa. The Iberians had extensive contact with Greek colonists in the colonies of Emporion, Rhode, and Hemeroskopeion. The Iberians may have adopted some of the Greeks&#x27; artistic techniques. Statues such as the Lady of Baza and the Lady of Elx are thought to have been made by Iberians relatively well acquainted with Greek art. Thucydides stated that one of the three original tribes of Sicily, the Sicani, were of Iberian origin, though &quot;Iberian&quot; at the time could have included what we think of as Gaul.

The Iberians also had contacts with the Phoenicians, who had established various colonies in southern Andalucia. Their first colony on the Iberian Peninsula was founded in 1100 BCE and was originally called &quot;Gadir&quot;, later renamed by the Romans as &quot;Gades&quot; (modern Cádiz). Other Phoenician colonies in southern Iberia included Malaka (Málaga), Sexi and Abdera.

According to Arrian, the Iberians sent emissaries to Alexander the Great in 324 BCE, along with other embassies of Carthaginians, Italics and Gauls, to request his friendship.

=== Second Punic War and Roman conquest ===
After the First Punic war, the massive war debt suffered by Carthage led them to attempt to expand their control over the Iberian peninsula. Hamilcar Barca began this conquest from his base at Cádiz by conquering the Tartessian Guadalquivir river region, which was rich in silver. After Hamilcar&#x27;s death, his son-in-law Hasdrubal the Fair continued his incursions into Iberia, founding the colony of Qart Hadasht (modern Cartagena) and extending his influence all the way to the southern bank of the river Ebro. After Hasdrubal&#x27;s assassination in 221 BCE, Hannibal assumed command of the Carthaginian forces and spent two years completing the conquest of the Iberians south of the Ebro. In his first campaign, Hannibal defeated the Olcades, the Vaccaei and the Carpetani expanding his control over the river Tagus region. Hannibal then laid siege to the Roman ally of Saguntum, and this led to the beginning of the Second Punic War. The Iberian theater was a key battleground during this war and many Iberian and Celtiberian warriors fought for both Rome and Carthage, though most tribes sided with Carthage.

Rome sent Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio to conquer Iberia from Carthage. Gnaeus subsequently defeated the Iberian Ilergetes tribe north of the Ebro who were allied with Carthage, conquered the Iberian oppidum of Tarraco and defeated the Carthaginian fleet. After the arrival of Publius Scipio, Tarraco was fortified and, by 211 BCE, the Scipio brothers had overrun the Carthaginian and allied forces south of the Ebro. However, during this campaign, Publius Scipio was killed in battle and Gnaeus died in the retreat. The tide turned with the arrival of Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus in 210 BCE. Scipio attacked and conquered Carthago Nova and defeated the army of Hasdrubal Barca at the Battle of Baecula (209–208). The war dragged on with Carthage sending more reinforcements until the Battle of Ilipa (modern Alcalá del Río in Sevilla province), which was a decisive victory for Publius Scipio Africanus. The Carthaginians retreated to Gades, and Publius Scipio gained control over the entire south of the peninsula. After this victory, the Ilergetes and other Iberian tribes revolted and it was only after this revolt that the Romans conquered the rest of the Carthaginian territories in southern Spain.

After the Carthaginian defeat, the Iberian territories were divided into two major provinces, Hispania Ulterior and Hispania Citerior. In 197 BCE, the Iberian tribes revolted once again in the H. Citerior province. After securing these regions, Rome invaded and conquered Lusitania and Celtiberia. The Romans fought a long and drawn out campaign for the conquest of Lusitania. Wars and campaigns in the northern regions of the Iberian peninsula would continue until 16 BCE, when the final rebellions of the Cantabrian Wars were defeated.

== Iberian culture ==

Iberian society was divided into different classes, including kings or chieftains (Latin: &quot;regulus&quot;), nobles, priests, artisans and slaves. Iberian aristocracy, often called a &quot;senate&quot; by the ancient sources, met in a council of nobles. Kings or chieftains would maintain their forces through a system of obligation or vassalage that the Romans termed &quot;fides&quot;.

The Iberians adopted wine and olives from the Greeks. Horse breeding was particularly important to the Iberians and their nobility. Mining was also very important for their economy, especially the silver mines near Gader and Cartago Nova, the iron mines in the Ebro valley, as well as the exploitation of tin and copper deposits. They produced fine metalwork and high quality iron weapons such as the falcata.

=== Art and religion ===
The Iberians produced sculpture in stone and bronze, most of which was much influenced by the Greeks and Phoenicians, and other cultures such as Assyrian, Hittite and Egyptian influences. The styles of Iberian sculpture are divided geographically into Levantine, Central, Southern, and Western groups, of which the Levantine group displays the most Greek influence. Iberian pottery and painting was also distinct and widespread throughout the region. A distinct feature of the culture, the pottery was primarily decorated with geometric forms in red but in some areas (from Murcia to the south of Catalonia) it also included figurative images.

The Iberian polytheistic religion was influenced by the Greek and Phoenician practices, as it is evident in their sculptures. The man-bull Bicha of Balazote (possibly a fertility deity) and various depictions of sphinxes and lions bear a resemblance to eastern Mediterranean mythological creatures. The Lady of Elche and Lady of Guardamar show clear Hellenistic influence. Phoenician and Greek deities like Tanit, Baal, Melkart, Artemis, Demeter and Asclepius were known in the region and worshiped. Currently few native Iberian gods are known, though the oracular healing deity &quot;Betatun&quot; is known from a Latin inscription at Fuertes del Rey. There was clearly an important female deity associated with the earth and regeneration as depicted by the Lady of Baza and linked with birds, flowers and wheat. The horse was also an important religious figure and an important sanctuary dedicated to Horses has been found in Mula (Murcia). There are many depictions of a &quot;horse taming god&quot; or &quot;lord of the horses&quot; (&quot;despotes hippon&quot;). The female goddess Ataegina is also widely attested in the inscriptions.

Iberians performed their rites in the open and also maintained sanctuaries in holy places like groves, springs and caves. Archaeological evidence suggests the existence of a priestly class and Silius Italicus mentions priests in the region of Tartessos at a temple of Melqart. Evidence from pottery reveals some information about Iberian myth and ritual. Common themes are a celebratory ritual dance described by Strabo [c.f. 3.3.7.] and seen in a relief from Fuerte del Rey known as the &quot;Bastetania dance&quot; and the confrontation between the deceased and a wolf figure. Ritual sacrifice of animals was also common.

In Iberian eschatology, &quot;death was seen as the starting point for a journey symbolised by a crossing of the sea, the land or even the sky. Supernatural and mythical beings, such as the Sphinx or the wolf, and sometimes Divinity itself, accompanied and guided the deceased on this journey&quot;. The Iberians incinerated their dead and placed their ashes in ceremonial urns, the remains were then placed in stone tombs.

=== Warfare ===


Iberian soldiers were widely employed by Carthage and Rome as mercenaries and auxiliary troops. A large portion of Carthaginian forces during the Punic wars was made up of Iberians and Celtiberians. Iberian warfare was endemic and based on intertribal raiding and pillaging. In set piece battle, Iberians were known to regularly charge and retreat, throwing javelins and shouting at their opponents without actually committing to full contact combat. This sort of fighting was termed &quot;concursare&quot; by the Romans. The Iberians were particularly fond of ambushes and guerrilla tactics.

Ancient sources mention two major types of Iberian infantry, &quot;scutati&quot; and &quot;caetrati&quot;. &quot;Scutati&quot; were heavily armored and carried large Italic style scutum shields. The &quot;caetrati&quot; carried the caetra, a small Iberian buckler. Iberian armaments included the famed Gladius Hispaniensis, a curved sword called the falcata, straight swords, spears, javelins and an all iron spear called the Soliferrum. Iberian horsemen were a key element of Iberian forces as well as Carthaginian armies. Spain was rich with excellent wild horses and Iberian cavalry was some of the best in the ancient Mediterranean.

=== Iberian tribes ===
 
Iberians dwelt along eastern and southern coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula, that corresponds to the northwestern shores of the Mediterranean Sea (see the map), roughly in today&#x27;s Catalonia, Eastern, Northeastern and Northern Aragon, Valencian Community, Murcia Region, Eastern Andalucia, and the Balearic Islands (in Spain), and also in today&#x27;s Roussillon and parts of Languedoc (in France).
The peninsula has this name because ancient Greeks, Romans and other mediterranean peoples first contacted with peoples (tribes or tribal confederacies) that were Iberians in the ethnic and linguistic sense, although the majority of the Iberian Peninsula&#x27;s peoples, that dwelt in the Northern, Central and Western regions (the majority of the peninsula&#x27;s area), were not Iberians themselves in the ethnic and linguistic sense (they could only be considered Iberians in the geographical sense, i.e. they dwelt in the Iberian Peninsula).

The Iberian tribes or tribal confederacies were:

*Andosini - in the mountains of East Pyrenees southern slopes, in the high Segre river basin, area of modern Andorra.
*Ausetani - in the Osona region (old County of Osona), in the middle Ter river basin. Ausa (today&#x27;s Vic) was their main centre.
*Bastetani/Bastitani/Bastuli - The biggest iberian tribal confederation in area, they dwelt in a territory that included large areas of the mediterranean coast and the Sierra Nevada, in what are today parts of the modern provinces of Murcia, Albacete, Jaén, Almería, Granada and Málaga. Basti (today&#x27;s Baza) was their main centre.
**Mastieni - in and around Mastia territory (Cartagena).
*Bergistani/Bergusii - in the high Llobregat river basin, roughly in today&#x27;s Barcelona province. Berga was their main centre. North of the Lacetani.
*Castellani - in the high Ter river basin, East Pyrenees southern slopes. North of the Ausetani.
*Cessetani/Cossetani - in the Tarraco region (roughly in today&#x27;s central and east Tarragona province), in the mediterranean coastal region. Kese (Tarraco in Roman times, that would become the Hispania Tarraconensis capital), was their main centre.
*Ceretani/Cerretani - in Cerretana (today&#x27;s Cerdanya/Cerdaña) and other East Pyrenees mountains southern slopes, also in the high Segre and Noguera rivers basins (tributaries of the Iberus - Ebro river), in the east part of Ribagorça. Libyca or Julia Libyca (today&#x27;s Llivia) was their main centre. North of the Ilergetes and the Bergistani.
*Contestani - South of the Sucro (Xúquer) river and north of the Thader (Segura) river, in an area that today is roughly part of the Alicante/Alacant, Valencia, Murcia and Albacete provinces. A tribal confederation. East of the Bastetani. Centres included Saetabi (modern Xàtiva) and la Bastida de les Alcusses.
**Deitani - in and around Ilici territory (today&#x27;s Elx/Elche)
*Edetani - North of the Sucro (Xúquer/Júcar) river and south of the Millars river, roughly in today&#x27;s Valencia province. One of the biggest iberian tribes or tribal confederations. Edeta (Roman times Lauro, today&#x27;s Lliria), to the northwest of Valencia, was their main centre, Arse (Saguntum in Roman times, today&#x27;s Sagunto/Sagunt) was also in their territory. North of the Contestani and the Bastetani and south of the Ilercavones.
*Elisyces/Helisyces - a tribe that dwelt in the region of Narbo (Narbonne) and modern northern Roussillon. May have been either Iberian or Ligurian or a Ligurian-Iberian tribe.
*Ilercavones - in the low Iberus (Ebro) river basin to the Millars river along the mediterranean coast and to the inland towards the Sierra de Gúdar, in Ilercavonia. One of the biggest iberian tribes or tribal confederations. Hibera (Roman time Dertusa or Dertosa, modern time Tortosa) was their main centre. North of the Edetani, south of the Ilergetes, east of the Sedetani and west of the Cessetani.
*Ilergetes/Ilergetae - in the plains area of the middle and low Segre and Cinca rivers towards the Iberus (Ebro) river margins. One of the biggest iberian tribes or tribal confederations. Iltrida (Ilerda in Roman times, today&#x27;s Lérida/Lleida) was their main centre.
*Indigetes/Indigetae - in the low Ter river basin, East Pyrenees southern slopes, they occupied the far north east area of the Iberian Peninsula known as Hispania Tarraconensis, in the gulf of Empodrae (Empúries) and Rhoda (Roses), stretching up into the Pyrenees though the regions of Empordà, Selva and perhaps as far as Gironès, in what is roughly today&#x27;s Girona Province. Indika/Indiga or Undika was their main centre (identified with the ruins of Ullastret). A confederation was formed by four tribes.
*Lacetani - in the middle Llobregat river basin and surrounding hills. Northwest of the Laietani. 
*Laietani - in the low Llobregat river basin, along a part of the mediterranean coast roughly in what is today a part of the Barcelona province and Barcelona city. Laieta (Barcino in Roman times and Barcelona in modern times) was their main centre.
*Oretani - In the high Baetis (Guadalquivir) river valley, eastern Marianus Mons (Sierra Morena) and southern area of today&#x27;s La Mancha. They could have been an Iberian tribe, a Celtic one, or a mixed Celtic and Iberian tribe or tribal confederacy (and hence related to the Celtiberians). The Mantesani/Mentesani/Mantasani of today&#x27;s La Mancha and the Germani (of Oretania) in eastern Marianus Mons (Sierra Morena) and west Jabalón river valley, sometimes are included in the Oretani but it is not certain if they were Oretani tribes.
*Sedetani - south of the Iberus (Ebro) river and west of the Guadalope river, roughly in the middle basin of the Iberus (Ebro). Salduie (Roman time Salduba and Caesaraugusta and modern time Zaragoza) was in their territory. May have been more closely related to the Edetani. West of the Ilercavones.
*Sordones - in the Roussillon territory (Pyrénées Orientales Department, France), Ruscino (today&#x27;s Château-Roussillon near Perpignan) was their main centre.
*Vescetani/Oscenses - In today&#x27;s northern Aragon, east of Gállego river, in Sobrarbe, in and around Bolskan, later Osca (Huesca), and high Cinca River valley, Spain. They could also be related to the Vascones and therefore be related to the Aquitani speaking the Aquitanian language.
*Unknown named tribe or tribes in the Balearic Islands (formed by the Pityusic Islands and Gymnesian islands), may have been Iberians.

=== Iberian language ===

The Iberian language, like the rest of the paleohispanic languages except Basque, became extinct by the 1st to 2nd centuries AD, after being gradually replaced by Latin. The Iberian language remains an unclassified non-Indo European language. A 1978 study claimed many similarities between Iberian and the Messapic language. Iberian languages also share some elements with the Basque language. Links have also been found with the Etruscan language and Minoan Linear A.

There are different theories about the origin of the Iberian language. According to the &quot;Catalan&quot; theory, the Iberian language originated in northern Catalonia, from where it expanded north and south.

=== Iberian scripts ===

The Iberians use three different scripts to represent the Iberian language.
* Northeastern Iberian script
** Dual variant (4th century BC and 3rd century BC)
** Non-dual variant (2nd century BC and 1st century BC)
* Southeastern Iberian script
* Greco-Iberian alphabet

Northeastern Iberian script and southeastern Iberian script share a common distinctive typological characteristic, also present in other paleohispanic scripts: they use signs with syllabic value for the occlusives and signs with monophonemic value for the rest of the consonants and vowels. As writing systems, they are neither alphabets nor syllabaries, but mixed scripts that normally are identified as semi-syllabaries. There is no agreement between researchers concerning the origin of the Iberian writing systems: for some they are only linked to the Phoenician alphabet while for others the Greek alphabet had an influence too.

<text>Loos-en-Gohelle (, ) is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Hauts-de-France region of France.

== Geography ==
It is a former coal mining town, three miles northwest of the centre of Lens. The two largest (184 m &amp; 182 m) spoil heaps in Europe are in Loos-en-Gohelle, those of pits 11 and 19, and are visible for miles around. They are part of the mines of the Nord-Pas de Calais region that have become the 38th French site on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites as &quot;a living and changing landscape&quot;.

<doc id="415874" wikidata="Q2344875" url="?curid=415874" title="List of astronomical observatories">
<text>This is a partial list of astronomical observatories ordered by name, along with initial dates of operation (where an accurate date is available) and location. The list also includes a final year of operation for many observatories that are no longer in operation. While other sciences, such as volcanology and meteorology, also use facilities called observatories for research and observations, this list is limited to observatories that are used to observe celestial objects.

Astronomical observatories are mainly divided into four categories: space-based, airborne, ground-based, and underground-based.

Many modern telescopes and observatories are located in space to observe astronomical objects in wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum that cannot penetrate the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere (such as ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays) and are thus impossible to observe using ground-based telescopes. Being above the atmosphere, these space observatories can also avoid the effects of atmospheric turbulence that plague ground based telescopes, although new generations of adaptive optics telescopes have since then dramatically improved the situation on the ground. The space high vacuum environment also frees the detectors from the ancestral diurnal cycle due to the atmospheric blue light background of the sky, thereby increasing significantly the observation time.

An intermediate variant is the airborne observatory, specialised in the infrared wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, that conduct observations above the part of the atmosphere containing water vapor that absorbs them, in the stratosphere.

Historically, astronomical observatories consisted generally in a building or group of buildings where observations of astronomical objects such as sunspots, planets, asteroids, comets, stars, nebulae, and galaxies in the visible wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum were conducted. At first, for millennia, astronomical observations have been made with naked eyes. Then with the discovery of optics, with the help of different types of refractor telescopes and later with reflector telescopes. Their use allowed to dramatically increase both the collecting power and limit of resolution, thus the brightness, level of detail and apparent angular size of distant celestial objects allowing them to be better studied and understood. Following the development of modern physics, new ground-based facilities have been constructed to conduct research in the radio and microwave wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, with radio telescopes and dedicated microwave telescopes.

Modern astrophysics has extended the field of study of celestial bodies to non-electromagnetic vectors, such as neutrinos, neutrons and cosmic rays or gravitational waves. Thus, new types of observatories have been developed. Interferometers are at the core of gravitational wave detectors. In order to limit the natural or artificial background noise, most particle detector based observatories are built deep underground.

<text>The poor cod (Trisopterus minutus) is a temperate marine fish belonging to the cod family (Gadidae). It is red brown in colour and has a pronounced chin barbel. It may grow up to a length of . It is usually found in small shoals at depths between over muddy or sandy bottoms. Its distribution spans the eastern Atlantic, from Norwegian coasts to Portugal and along the Atlantic coast of Morocco. Spawning takes place towards the end of winter. They are often regarded as a mini species and are commonly confused with pouting as they have a similar appearance. They are often seen as a menace for anglers and have little commercial value and so are not currently at any risk of extinction.

They feed on crustaceans, small fish and marine worm. They are eaten by seals, dolphins and larger fish. It is commercially harvested for the production of fish meal, and in southern Europe as food.

<text>Beau Travail (, French for &quot;good work&quot;) is a 1999 French film directed by Claire Denis, who co-wrote the screenplay alongside Jean-Pol Fargeau, an adaptation of Billy Budd by Herman Melville. The story, is set in Djibouti, where the protagonists are soldiers in the French Foreign Legion. Parts of the soundtrack of the movie are from Benjamin Britten&#x27;s 1951 opera based on the novella.

==Plot==
Adjudant-Chef Galoup of the French Foreign Legion reflects on his life from his home in Marseille. He recalls his time in Djibouti, where he led a section of men under the command of Commandant Bruno Forestier. Galoup admired and envied many of Forestier&#x27;s qualities, including his clear affection from the men, and retains a wristband with Forestier&#x27;s name. Galoup has a Djiboutian girlfriend, and they often go out dancing.

One day, a new recruit named Gilles Sentain joins Galoup&#x27;s section. Galoup harbors an immediate and seemingly irrational hostility towards Sentain, and vows to destroy him. When Sentain hands a canteen of water to another soldier who is being punished by being forced to dig a large hole in the heat of the day, Galoup chastises Sentain and knocks the water from his hand. Sentain strikes Galoup, who retaliates by taking Sentain into the desert and ordering him to walk back to the base alone. However, Galoup had previously tampered with Sentain&#x27;s compass, causing him to become lost and collapse from dehydration in the arid salt flats.

Sentain is ultimately found and rescued by locals, but never returns to the base and is presumed to have deserted. His compass is later found by the legionnaires at a local sale of salt-encrusted novelties, and is believed to prove Sentain is dead. On the assumption that Galoup has either killed or attempted to kill Sentain, Galoup is sent back to France by Forestier for a court martial, ending his career in the Foreign Legion. He makes his bed in the immaculate military manner, then lies on top clutching a pistol, and reads aloud the phrase tattooed on his chest: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Serve the good cause and die&quot;). The film ends with a sequence of Galoup at a night club in Djibouti, engaging in a lively acrobatic solo dance to &quot;The Rhythm of the Night&quot;.

==Cast==
* Denis Lavant as Adjudant-Chef Galoup
* Michel Subor as Commandant Bruno Forestier
* Grégoire Colin as Légionnaire Gilles Sentain
* Richard Courcet as Légionnaire
* Nicolas Duvauchelle as Légionnaire

Subor played a character with the same name 30 years earlier in &quot;Le petit soldat&quot;.

==Production==
Denis said, &quot;One of the cast had actually been in the Legion, so we took all their real exercises and did them together every day, to concentrate the actors as a group. We never said we were going to choreograph the film. But afterwards, when we started shooting, using Britten&#x27;s music, those exercises became like a dance.&quot;

==Release==
The film was screened on 4 September 1999 in the Cinema del Presente section at the 56th Venice International Film Festival. It was theatrically released in France on 3 May 2000 by Pyramide Distribution.

==Reception==
The film was highly acclaimed in the United States, topping the &quot;Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s Film Critics&#x27; Poll in 2000, with Claire Denis also placing at #2 for best director. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; rated it a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, giving it the paper&#x27;s highest rating of four stars. Charles Taylor of &quot;Salon.com&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Beau Travail&quot; is the most extreme example of [Denis&#x27;] talent, baffling and exhilarating. I don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ve seen a movie that is in so many ways foreign to what draws me to movies and still felt under a spell.&quot; J. Hoberman of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote that the film is &quot;so tactile in its cinematography, inventive in its camera placement, and sensuous in its editing that the purposefully oblique and languid narrative is all but eclipsed.&quot; Film scholar Erika Balsom wrote that the ending sequence &quot;is perhaps the best ending of any film, ever,&quot; explaining that &quot;Galoup finds a rhythm of life that follows none of the patterns of colonial, patriarchal power the film so skilfully traces and complicates...he inhabits a utopia of movement without rules&quot;.

The review aggregator website, Metacritic, gave the film a score of 91 out of 100 based on 20 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. On Rotten Tomatoes, another aggregator, it has an 87% approval rating based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Beau Travail&quot; finds director Claire Denis drawing on classic literature to construct a modern tragedy fueled by timeless desires&quot;.

In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named the film as the 12th best film in their list The 100 Greatest Movies of the Nineties.

In the 2022 &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; critic&#x27;s poll, &quot;Beau Travail&quot; was ranked the 7th best movie of all time. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Beau Travail&quot; at 69 for its list The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time.

<doc id="415883" wikidata="Q585943" url="?curid=415883" title="Hydrogen-alpha">
<text>Hydrogen-alpha, typically shortened to H-alpha or Hα, is a deep-red visible spectral line of the hydrogen atom with a wavelength of 656.28 nm in air and 656.46 nm in vacuum. It is the first spectral line in the Balmer series and is emitted when an electron falls from a hydrogen atom&#x27;s third- to second-lowest energy level. H-alpha has applications in astronomy where its emission can be observed from emission nebulae and from features in the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere, including solar prominences and the chromosphere.

==Balmer series==
According to the Bohr model of the atom, electrons exist in quantized energy levels surrounding the atom&#x27;s nucleus. These energy levels are described by the principal quantum number &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3, ... . Electrons may only exist in these states, and may only transit between these states.

The set of transitions from &quot;n&quot; ≥ 3 to &quot;n&quot; = 2 is called the Balmer series and its members are named sequentially by Greek letters: 
*&quot;n&quot; = 3 to &quot;n&quot; = 2 is called Balmer-alpha or H-alpha, 
*&quot;n&quot; = 4 to &quot;n&quot; = 2 is called Balmer-beta or H-beta, 
*&quot;n&quot; = 5 to &quot;n&quot; = 2 is called Balmer-gamma or H-gamma, etc.

For the Lyman series the naming convention is: 
*&quot;n&quot; = 2 to &quot;n&quot; = 1 is called Lyman-alpha, 
*&quot;n&quot; = 3 to &quot;n&quot; = 1 is called Lyman-beta, etc.

H-alpha has a wavelength of 656.281 nm, is visible in the red part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and is the easiest way for astronomers to trace the ionized hydrogen content of gas clouds. Since it takes nearly as much energy to excite the hydrogen atom&#x27;s electron from &quot;n&quot; = 1 to &quot;n&quot; = 3 (12.1 eV, via the Rydberg formula) as it does to ionize the hydrogen atom (13.6 eV), ionization is far more probable than excitation to the &quot;n&quot; = 3 level. After ionization, the electron and proton recombine to form a new hydrogen atom. In the new atom, the electron may begin in any energy level, and subsequently cascades to the ground state (&quot;n&quot; = 1), emitting photons with each transition. Approximately half the time, this cascade will include the &quot;n&quot; = 3 to &quot;n&quot; = 2 transition and the atom will emit H-alpha light. Therefore, the H-alpha line occurs where hydrogen is being ionized.

The H-alpha line saturates (self-absorbs) relatively easily because hydrogen is the primary component of nebulae, so while it can indicate the shape and extent of the cloud, it cannot be used to accurately determine the cloud&#x27;s mass. Instead, molecules such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, ammonia, or acetonitrile are typically used to determine the mass of a cloud.


==Filter==


An H-alpha filter is an optical filter designed to transmit a narrow bandwidth of light generally centred on the H-alpha wavelength. These filters can be dichroic filters manufactured by multiple (~50) vacuum-deposited layers. These layers are selected to produce interference effects that filter out any wavelengths except at the requisite band.

Taken in isolation, H-alpha dichroic filters are useful in astrophotography and for reducing the effects of light pollution. They do not have narrow enough bandwidth for observing the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere.

For observing the Sun, a much narrower band filter can be made from three parts: an &quot;energy rejection filter&quot; which is usually a piece of red glass that absorbs most of the unwanted wavelengths, a Fabry–Pérot etalon which transmits several wavelengths including one centred on the H-alpha emission line, and a &quot;blocking filter&quot; -a dichroic filter which transmits the H-alpha line while stopping those other wavelengths that passed through the etalon. This combination will pass only a narrow (&lt;0.1 nm) range of wavelengths of light centred on the H-alpha emission line.

The physics of the etalon and the dichroic interference filters are essentially the same (relying on constructive/destructive interference of light reflecting between surfaces), but the implementation is different (a dichroic interference filter relies on the interference of internal reflections while the etalon has a relatively large air gap). Due to the high velocities sometimes associated with features visible in H-alpha light (such as fast moving prominences and ejections), solar H-alpha etalons can often be tuned (by tilting or changing the temperature or air density) to cope with the associated Doppler effect.

Commercially available H-alpha filters for amateur solar observing usually state bandwidths in Angstrom units and are typically 0.7Å (0.07 nm). By using a second etalon, this can be reduced to 0.5Å leading to improved contrast in details observed on the Sun&#x27;s disc.

An even more narrow band filter can be made using a Lyot filter.

<text>Kevin Clifford Ashman (born 2 November 1959) is an English quiz player. He is considered one of the greatest quizzers in the world, has been a professional quizzer since 2002 and he has appeared on &quot;Eggheads&quot; since 2003 and is the only Egghead to appear in every series of the show as of April 2023. He has won most of the top-level quiz tournaments in which he has taken part, among them several World and European Championships.

==Early life==
Ashman was born in Winchester, Hampshire, He attended St Bede&#x27;s Primary School and Peter Symonds Grammar School/College. He then graduated from the University of Southampton with a BA degree in Modern History. Ashman taught himself to read when he was three years old in the early 1960s.

==Career==
Ashman had his first major television quiz success on &quot;Fifteen to One&quot;, winning Series 3 in 1989, and returned to win the special &#x27;Millennium Edition&#x27; between past champions in 1999. In 1995, he won &quot;Mastermind&quot;, scoring a record 41 points with no passes in his heat. His specialist subject on that occasion was the life and work of Martin Luther King Jr. He later became the champion after winning the final with the subject Zulu War and, in 2006, appeared on the final of the Junior version encouraging a young contestant who also chose Zulu Wars as his final subject. In 1996, the year following his &quot;Mastermind&quot; victory, he won &quot;Brain of Britain&quot;, scoring 38 in his semi final, which remains the highest individual score ever made on the show. He then went on to win &quot;Brain of Brains&quot; (contested between the previous three years&#x27; Brains of Britain) and &quot;Top Brain&quot; (contested every nine years between the previous three &quot;Brain of Brains&quot;). Ashman also twice won &quot;Master Brain&quot;, a radio competition for winners and runners-up of &quot;Mastermind&quot; and &quot;Brain of Britain&quot;.

He also won &quot;Sale of the Century&quot;, &quot;Screen Test&quot;, &quot;Quiz Night&quot;, &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; and &quot;The Great British Quiz&quot;.

==Professional==

===Question-setter for &quot;Brain of Britain&quot;===
Between 2002 and 2006, Ashman was the question-setter and arbiter on the Radio 4 quiz show &quot;Brain of Britain&quot;, working under the pen-name of &#x27;Jorkins&#x27; (a name taken from &quot;David Copperfield&quot;). He was appointed to the position on the death of Ian Gillies, who worked under the pen-name &#x27;Mycroft&#x27;. He left when production moved to Manchester.

===Eggheads===
From 2003 until April 2023, he has competed on the British quiz show &quot;Eggheads&quot;, teamed up with other quiz champions, in which members of the public pit their wits against them in order to win a cash prize. Alongside his Egghead teammates, he also took part in the spin-off show &quot;Are You an Egghead?&quot;, a competition to find further members of the Egghead team, resulting in the addition of Barry Simmons in 2008 and Pat Gibson in the second series in 2009. For 10 years, Ashman had never incorrectly answered a history category question, this happened for the first time on 6 January 2014 which caused him to miss out on the final round of that day. Ashman is known as &#x27;The Grandmaster&#x27; on Eggheads.

==National and international quizzing championships==



























Currently ranked World/European number 1, Ashman has 17 gold, 13 silver and 3 bronze medals from the British, European and World Championships, and has been capped 10 times for the England team, with a record of 7 wins and 3 losses. In addition he has won the British Quiz Championship seven times, as well as many other tournaments. In 2004 he won the World Quizzing Championships individual competition, a tournament organised by the newly formed International Quizzing Association (IQA), as well as the European Quizzing Championships (organised by the same group) both individually and for nations, in Gent, Belgium. He followed this up by winning the World Quizzing Championships again in July 2005. He is the first person to retain this title and, for a second year running, he finished ahead of Pat Gibson of Ireland and Nico Pattyn of Belgium. In November 2005 he retained his individual title at the European Quizzing Championships in Tallinn, Estonia. At this event he again captained the England quiz team, this time losing to Belgium in the final. In July 2006 he won the World Quizzing Championships for the third year in succession and followed this in December by again winning the European Quizzing Championships (held near Paris, France). He also won the team title with his team Milhous Warriors, but the English quiz team was once again beaten by the Belgians. In 2007 Ashman lost his World title to Pat Gibson, who narrowly beat him into runner-up spot (a position Gibson himself had occupied for four years). He also lost his European title to Nico Pattyn of Belgium, but he took revenge by regaining the title with the England national team, beating the Belgians in the final at Blackpool. In 2008, in Oslo, this situation was reversed with him being runner-up in the team competition but regaining his singles title. In 2009 he regained the World title, the first player ever to do so, when winning for the 4th time. In 2009 he narrowly missed the British title, losing by a point in a tie-break, to 2008 World Champion Mark Bytheway.

==Domestic competition/Quiz leagues==

Ashman is a committed quizzer and has three main teams (excluding the &quot;Eggheads&quot; team on TV). In the QLL he competes with the &quot;Allsorts&quot; (alongside former Mastermind winner Gavin Fuller) and has won the league on numerous occasions, in the &quot;Winchester Quiz League&quot;, organised by Peter Byford, he plays for the &quot;King Alfred&quot; and in national events he plays for the &quot;Milhous Warriors&quot;. The Milhous Warriors, most of whom are based in Swindon, England, have often emerged victorious in the team elements of events run by Quizzing.co.uk, becoming National Champions at Old Trafford football stadium in 2004 and Silverstone in 2005 as part of those years&#x27; UK leg of the World Quizzing Championship event. In 2006 they became the first British team to win the European Team Championship, doing so in Paris. In 2008 they were winners in the final of the Clubs and Institutes (CIU) IDC Freeclaim sponsored national championships.

==Personal life==
A keen traveller, he lives in Winnall, Winchester in Hampshire. It was revealed on &quot;Eggheads&quot; on 5 October 2009 that Ashman supports Tottenham Hotspur. He also has an interest in folk music and is a keen theatregoer. He was Peter Kay and Paddy McGuinness&#x27; Phone-A-Friend for their appearance on &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; on 12 January 2008.

In April 2024, it was revealed that Ashman is an avid watcher of the BBC Two programme &quot;University Challenge&quot;.

<text>Chase Masterson (born Christianne Carafano on February 26, 1963) is an American actress and singer.

==Early life==
Masterson was born Christianne Carafano in Colorado Springs, Colorado. As her father was in the Army, she grew up in several places, among them West Haven, Connecticut and three years in Germany. Her family settled in El Paso, Texas when she was in the sixth grade. Masterson graduated from the University of Texas and has one child.

==Career==
===Acting===
Masterson&#x27;s first major role came in 1994 as Ivy Lief on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. She then spent five years portraying the Bajoran Dabo girl Leeta on &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; from 1995 to 1999. Her prominent feature film roles include starring as a sultry singer in James Kerwin&#x27;s sci-fi film noir &quot;Yesterday Was a Lie,&quot; which she also produced, and voicing Janice Em in the animated film &quot;.&quot; Her television guest-starring roles include &quot;ER&quot; and &quot;Sliders;&quot; in the latter, her role was that of Kelly Welles, the sister of Wade Welles.

Masterson hosted an &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;-style news program for the Sci-Fi Channel in the 1990s called &quot;Sci-Fi Entertainment&quot; and an Internet-based radio talk show for the website The Fandom in 2004–2005.

Since 2010, Masterson has reprised her role as Leeta from &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, both in hologram form and in her &quot;mirror universe&quot; guise, in Cryptic Studios&#x27; &quot;Star Trek Online.&quot; After Masterson appeared in two &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio adventures from Big Finish Productions, it was announced on October 19, 2012, that she would star in her own spin-off series, &quot;Vienna&quot;, as &quot;impossibly glamorous bounty hunter&quot; Vienna Salvatori.

Masterson is voicing the title character &quot;Auto&quot; in monochrom&#x27;s science fiction comedy film &quot;Je Suis Auto&quot; (release 2023). The film is a farcical comedy that deals with issues such as AI, politics of labor, and tech culture.

===Singer and live performer===

Masterson has released two commercial records: 2011&#x27;s &quot;Yesterday Was a Lie&quot; and 2012&#x27;s &quot;Burned With Desire.&quot; In addition, she has released several independent jazz CDs: &quot;Thrill of the Chase,&quot; whose title is a play on her stage name, the follow-up EP (Latin for &quot;To the Stars!&quot;), the limited edition &quot;Crystal Anniversary: Songs from the Holosuite&quot; in honor of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&#x27;s&quot; fifteenth anniversary, and the &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation &quot;Jazz Cocktail.&quot;

Masterson was special guest star at the 20th anniversary edition of cocktail robot festival Roboexotica in Vienna and performed a live jazz set for &quot;robots and humans&quot;.

===Film producer===
Masterson was named Best Feature Film Producer of 2008 by the LA Femme Film Festival for her work as producer of the mystery/drama &quot;Yesterday Was a Lie&quot;.

===Advocacy===
In 2013, Masterson, who experienced bullying herself while in school, co-founded the Pop Culture Hero Coalition, a non-profit organization speaking out against &quot;bullying, racism, misogyny, cyber-bullying, LGBT-bullying, and other forms of hate.&quot;

==Public image==

In 2004, as a result of her genre work, Masterson was named one of the world&#x27;s &quot;50 Sexiest Women&quot; by the men&#x27;s magazine &quot;Femme Fatales&quot;, and the &quot;Favorite Science Fiction Actress on Television&quot; in a &quot;TV Guide&quot; reader&#x27;s poll. In December 2009, AOL named her one of the &quot;Ten Sexiest Aliens on TV&quot;, reporting that Masterson is &quot;regularly voted the most popular guest at &quot;Star Trek&quot; conventions.&quot;

==Lawsuit against Matchmaker.com==
Following a series of stalking incidents instigated by a man in Berlin, Masterson – under her birth name of Christianne Carafano – was the petitioner in &quot;Carafano v. Metrosplash.com&quot;, an online dating service, formerly Matchmaker.com, on which the man had created a fictitious dating profile that contained Masterson&#x27;s home address, telephone number, four photographs of her, and a description of her that characterized her as . As a result, she received a series of unwanted communications, including obscene telephone calls. When the matter was brought to the attention of Matchmaker.com, that service refused to remove the profile. Masterson then sued Matchmaker.com for defamation, invasion of privacy, misappropriation of the right of publicity and negligence. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled against Masterson, deciding the man who created the profile was responsible for it, and not Matchmaker.com. The court cited Communications Decency Act, which states that &quot;No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.&quot;

<doc id="415893" wikidata="Q653711" url="?curid=415893" title="Balmer series">
<text>The Balmer series, or Balmer lines in atomic physics, is one of a set of six named series describing the spectral line emissions of the hydrogen atom. The Balmer series is calculated using the Balmer formula, an empirical equation discovered by Johann Balmer in 1885.

The visible spectrum of light from hydrogen displays four wavelengths, 410 nm, 434 nm, 486 nm, and 656 nm, that correspond to emissions of photons by electrons in excited states transitioning to the quantum level described by the principal quantum number &quot;n&quot; equals 2. There are several prominent ultraviolet Balmer lines with wavelengths shorter than 400 nm. The series continues with an infinite number of lines whose wavelengths asymptotically approach the limit of 364.5 nm in the ultraviolet.

After Balmer&#x27;s discovery, five other hydrogen spectral series were discovered, corresponding to electrons transitioning to values of &quot;n&quot; other than two.

== Overview ==
The Balmer series is characterized by the electron transitioning from &quot;n&quot; ≥ 3 to &quot;n&quot; = 2, where &quot;n&quot; refers to the radial quantum number or principal quantum number of the electron. The transitions are named sequentially by Greek letter: &quot;n&quot; = 3 to &quot;n&quot; = 2 is called H-α, 4 to 2 is H-β, 5 to 2 is H-γ, and 6 to 2 is H-δ. As the first spectral lines associated with this series are located in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, these lines are historically referred to as &quot;H-alpha&quot;, &quot;H-beta&quot;, &quot;H-gamma&quot;, and so on, where H is the element hydrogen.

Although physicists were aware of atomic emissions before 1885, they lacked a tool to accurately predict where the spectral lines should appear. The Balmer equation predicts the four visible spectral lines of hydrogen with high accuracy. Balmer&#x27;s equation inspired the Rydberg equation as a generalization of it, and this in turn led physicists to find the Lyman, Paschen, and Brackett series, which predicted other spectral lines of hydrogen found outside the visible spectrum.

The red H-alpha spectral line of the Balmer series of atomic hydrogen, which is the transition from the shell &quot;n&quot; = 3 to the shell &quot;n&quot; = 2, is one of the conspicuous colours of the universe. It contributes a bright red line to the spectra of emission or ionisation nebula, like the Orion Nebula, which are often H II regions found in star forming regions. In true-colour pictures, these nebula have a reddish-pink colour from the combination of visible Balmer lines that hydrogen emits.

Later, it was discovered that when the Balmer series lines of the hydrogen spectrum were examined at very high resolution, they were closely spaced doublets. This splitting is called fine structure. It was also found that excited electrons from shells with &quot;n&quot; greater than 6 could jump to the &quot;n&quot; = 2 shell, emitting shades of ultraviolet when doing so.
== Balmer&#x27;s formula ==
Balmer noticed that a single wavelength had a relation to every line in the hydrogen spectrum that was in the visible light region. That wavelength was . When any integer higher than 2 was squared and then divided by itself squared minus 4, then that number multiplied by (see equation below) gave the wavelength of another line in the hydrogen spectrum. By this formula, he was able to show that some measurements of lines made in his time by spectroscopy were slightly inaccurate, and his formula also predicted lines that had not yet been observed but were found later. His number also proved to be the limit of the series.
The Balmer equation could be used to find the wavelength of the absorption/emission lines and was originally presented as follows (save for a notation change to give Balmer&#x27;s constant as &quot;B&quot;):
formula_1
Where
*&quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength.
*&quot;B&quot; is a constant with the value of or .
*&quot;m&quot; is the initial state formula_2
*&quot;n&quot; is the final state formula_3

In 1888 the physicist Johannes Rydberg generalized the Balmer equation for all transitions of hydrogen. The equation commonly used to calculate the Balmer series is a specific example of the Rydberg formula and follows as a simple reciprocal mathematical rearrangement of the formula above (conventionally using a notation of m for n as the single integral constant needed):

formula_4

where &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength of the absorbed/emitted light and &quot;R&quot;H is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen. The Rydberg constant is seen to be equal to in Balmer&#x27;s formula, and this value, for an infinitely heavy nucleus, is  = .

== Role in astronomy ==
The Balmer series is particularly useful in astronomy because the Balmer lines appear in numerous stellar objects due to the abundance of hydrogen in the universe, and therefore are commonly seen and relatively strong compared to lines from other elements. The first two Balmer lines correspond to the Fraunhofer lines C and F.

The spectral classification of stars, which is primarily a determination of surface temperature, is based on the relative strength of spectral lines, and the Balmer series in particular is very important. Other characteristics of a star that can be determined by close analysis of its spectrum include surface gravity (related to physical size) and composition.

Because the Balmer lines are commonly seen in the spectra of various objects, they are often used to determine radial velocities due to doppler shifting of the Balmer lines. This has important uses all over astronomy, from detecting binary stars, exoplanets, compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes (by the motion of hydrogen in accretion disks around them), identifying groups of objects with similar motions and presumably origins (moving groups, star clusters, galaxy clusters, and debris from collisions), determining distances (actually redshifts) of galaxies or quasars, and identifying unfamiliar objects by analysis of their spectrum.

Balmer lines can appear as absorption or emission lines in a spectrum, depending on the nature of the object observed. In stars, the Balmer lines are usually seen in absorption, and they are &quot;strongest&quot; in stars with a surface temperature of about 10,000 kelvins (spectral type A). In the spectra of most spiral and irregular galaxies, active galactic nuclei, H II regions and planetary nebulae, the Balmer lines are emission lines.

In stellar spectra, the H-epsilon line (transition 7→2, 397.007 nm) is often mixed in with another absorption line caused by ionized calcium known as &quot;H&quot; (the original designation given by Joseph von Fraunhofer). H-epsilon is separated by 0.16 nm from Ca II H at 396.847 nm, and cannot be resolved in low-resolution spectra. The H-zeta line (transition 8→2) is similarly mixed in with a neutral helium line seen in hot stars.

<text>In physics and chemistry, the Lyman series is a hydrogen spectral series of transitions and resulting ultraviolet emission lines of the hydrogen atom as an electron goes from &quot;n&quot; ≥ 2 to &quot;n&quot; = 1 (where &quot;n&quot; is the principal quantum number), the lowest energy level of the electron (groundstate). The transitions are named sequentially by Greek letters: from &quot;n&quot; = 2 to &quot;n&quot; = 1 is called Lyman-alpha, 3 to 1 is Lyman-beta, 4 to 1 is Lyman-gamma, and so on. The series is named after its discoverer, Theodore Lyman. The greater the difference in the principal quantum numbers, the higher the energy of the electromagnetic emission.

==History==
The first line in the spectrum of the Lyman series was discovered in 1906 by physicist Theodore Lyman IV, who was studying the ultraviolet spectrum of electrically excited hydrogen gas. The rest of the lines of the spectrum (all in the ultraviolet) were discovered by Lyman from 1906-1914.
The spectrum of radiation emitted by hydrogen is non-continuous or discrete. Here is an illustration of the first series of hydrogen emission lines:
Historically, explaining the nature of the hydrogen spectrum was a considerable problem in physics. Nobody could predict the wavelengths of the hydrogen lines until 1885 when the Balmer formula gave an empirical formula for the visible hydrogen spectrum. Within five years Johannes Rydberg came up with an empirical formula that solved the problem, presented first in 1888 and final form in 1890. Rydberg managed to find a formula to match the known Balmer series emission lines, and also predicted those not yet discovered. Different versions of the Rydberg formula with different simple numbers were found to generate different series of lines.

On December 1, 2011, it was announced that Voyager 1 detected the first Lyman-alpha radiation originating from the Milky Way galaxy. Lyman-alpha radiation had previously been detected from other galaxies, but due to interference from the Sun, the radiation from the Milky Way was not detectable.

==The Lyman series==

The version of the Rydberg formula that generated the Lyman series was:
formula_1
where &quot;n&quot; is a natural number greater than or equal to 2 (i.e., ).

Therefore, the lines seen in the image above are the wavelengths corresponding to &quot;n&quot; = 2 on the right, to &quot;n&quot; → ∞ on the left. There are infinitely many spectral lines, but they become very dense as they approach &quot;n&quot; → ∞ (the Lyman limit), so only some of the first lines and the last one appear.

The wavelengths in the Lyman series are all ultraviolet:
==Explanation and derivation==

In 1914, when Niels Bohr produced his Bohr model theory, the reason why hydrogen spectral lines fit Rydberg&#x27;s formula was explained. Bohr found that the electron bound to the hydrogen atom must have quantized energy levels described by the following formula,

:formula_2

According to Bohr&#x27;s third assumption, whenever an electron falls from an initial energy level &quot;E&quot;i to a final energy level &quot;E&quot;f, the atom must emit radiation with a wavelength of

:formula_3

There is also a more comfortable notation when dealing with energy in units of electronvolts and wavelengths in units of angstroms,

:formula_4Å.

Replacing the energy in the above formula with the expression for the energy in the hydrogen atom where the initial energy corresponds to energy level &quot;n&quot; and the final energy corresponds to energy level &quot;m&quot;,

:formula_5

Where &quot;R&quot;H is the same Rydberg constant for hydrogen from Rydberg&#x27;s long known formula. This also means that the inverse of the Rydberg constant is equal to the Lyman limit.

For the connection between Bohr, Rydberg, and Lyman, one must replace &quot;m&quot; with 1 to obtain

:formula_6

which is Rydberg&#x27;s formula for the Lyman series. Therefore, each wavelength of the emission lines corresponds to an electron dropping from a certain energy level (greater than 1) to the first energy level.

<text>Walter Paye Lane (February 18, 1817 – January 28, 1892) was a Confederate general during the American Civil War who also served in the armies of the Republic of Texas and the United States of America.

==Early life==
Lane was born in County Cork, Ireland. The Lane family emigrated to Fairview in Guernsey County, Ohio, in 1821, and moved to Kentucky in 1825. In 1836 Lane moved to Texas to participate in its war for independence against Mexico. After Texas had gained its independence, Lane lived in San Augustine County in East Texas and then San Antonio, where he briefly served as a Texas Ranger. In 1846 Lane joined the 1st Regiment of Texas Mounted Rifle Volunteers as a first lieutenant to fight in the Mexican–American War. Lane fought with honors at the Battle of Monterrey and was later given the rank of major and command of his own battalion. After the Mexican–American War, Lane wandered about doing various things in Arizona, California, and Peru before opening a mercantile business in Marshall, Texas, in 1858.

==Civil War==
When the Civil War broke out, Lane was among the first Texans to call for secession. Lane&#x27;s military reputation was so great that the first volunteer Confederate company raised in Harrison County was named for him, though Lane would join the 3rd Texas Cavalry. Lane participated in the battles of Wilson&#x27;s Creek, Missouri, Chustenahlah, Pea Ridge and both the Siege of Corinth and Second Battle of Corinth. Lane led the 3rd Texas at the battle of Franklin, Mississippi, and was commended by General P.G.T. Beauregard for his efforts. Lane was severely wounded in the Battle of Mansfield in 1864, where Confederates forces rebuffed a push to capture either or both Shreveport, Louisiana, or Marshall, Texas. Before the war ended, Lane was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in 1865, being confirmed on the last day the Confederate Congress met.

==Postbellum career==
After the Civil War Lane returned to Marshall where he helped to establish the Texas Veterans Association. He died in Marshall, Texas, and is buried in the Marshall Cemetery near downtown Marshall. His memoirs, &quot;The Adventures and Recollections of General Walter P. Lane&quot;, were published posthumously in 1928.

<text>The Slovak language is a West Slavic language. Historically, it forms a dialect continuum with Czech. The written standard is based on the work of Ľudovít Štúr, published in the 1840s and codified in July 1843 in Hlboké.

==Theories about the origin==
===Older hypotheses and theories===
====Centrist hypothesis====
The centrist hypothesis was popular in the 19th century when it played a positive role in the Slovak national movement. According to this theory, Slovak is the remnant of the Proto-Slavic language spoken in the Middle Danube region before the great migration of the Slavs. This hypothesis is based on Nestor&#x27;s Primary Chronicle and was supported by Matej Bel and several notable members of the movement, like Pavel Jozef Šafárik, Anton Bernolák and Ľudovít Štúr. Most modern scholars oppose the opinion about the Slavic homeland being in the Middle Danube, but the theory was revived in the 20th century by the Russian linguist Oleg Trubachyov.

====Nonhomogeneous origin====
The theories about the nonhomogeneous origin of Slovak assume its late integration in the 13th to 14th centuries or even after the 16th century. They claim that the Proto-Slavic basis of Slovak emerged on the border of early Western, Southern and Eastern Slavic macro dialects or that Slovak emerged from early or late mixing of neighboring languages. A prominent Slovak linguist, Samuel Czambel (1856–1909), believed that Western Slovak dialects are derived from early Western Slavic, that Central Slovak dialects are remains of the South Slavic language area (Czechized over centuries) and that Eastern Slovak dialects come from Old Polish and Old Ukrainian. Samuil Bernstein supported a similar theory. István Kniezsa suggested a mixing of languages in today&#x27;s Central Slovakia after the Mongol invasion of Europe and Ottoman wars, thus forming modern Central Slovak dialects. The opinion about the late integration is not compliant with the current state of knowledge about the development of Slovak dialects from Proto-Slavic.

====Homogeneous origin====
This theory was proposed in the interwar period by Czech linguists František Trávníček and Václav Vážný. Its proponents believed that Slovak and Czech emerged from a common Proto-Czech-Slovak (Proto-Czech). Trávníček explained unique features of Central Slovak dialects by later differentiation, Vážný, by expansion from the south. Trávníček&#x27;s attempt to explain the origin of Slovak from Proto-Czech-Slovak is now thought to be erroneous, and the creator of the theory abandoned it already after World War II.

===Modern theories===
Modern theories are based on a nonhomogeneous Proto-Slavic basis of Slovak. The prevailing theory is the migration-integration theory of Rudolf Krajčovič.

====Migration-integration theory====
Rudolf Krajčovič suggests three phases of development:
* post-migration period (5th–7th centuries): the Slavs came to present-day Slovakia from various locations; Western and Eastern Slovakia was settled by people who spoke Northwestern (West Slavic) Proto-Slavic dialect, Central Slovakia by speakers of the Southeastern (non-West Slavic) dialect.
* integration period (8th–9th centuries): several language features (both West and non-West Slavic) spread across the borders of the initial linguistic regions; these changes are best explained by the integration process of the Slavs before and during the existence of Great Moravia.
* constitutive period (10th–11th centuries): After the extinction of Proto-Slavic, Slovak began to evolve as a separate Slavic language.

====Koine theory====
This theory was proposed by a Slovak linguist Martin Pukanec. According to Pukanec, the migration-integration theory does not explain the presence of old isoglosses around Nitra, one main old political center. The main idea of the theory is koineization, a formation of a super-dialect (koiné) on the border of the West Slavic and the South Slavic dialects. The koineization on the border of two dialects may have been very rapid with many dramatic changes, possibly even two or three in one generation.

The author suggests the following chronology:
* an early integration period (6th century–833)
* koineization (833–907): The four phases of koineization correspond with the phases of development of Great Moravia.
* constitutive period (907–1110): The koiné was disintegrated, and the tribal system finally became extinct.

The arguments for this theory are mostly indirect.

==Emergence and development==
===Heterogenous Proto-Slavic basis of Slovak===
The Proto-Slavic basis of Slovak included both West Slavic and Non-West Slavic features. Some West Slavic features are common for all Slovak dialects, but there are also Non-West Slavic features that are distributed over 70–75% of the territory. The Central Slovak dialects exhibits major deviations from what is generally thought of as West Slavic.


===Main changes in the Proto-Slavic basis===
In the 10th century, Proto-Slavic ceased to exist, and Slovak began to emerge as an independent language. The most important early changes were the contraction, the loss and vocalization of yers and the denasalization of &quot;ǫ&quot; and &quot;ę&quot;. These changes affected the word structure and phonemes. The loss of yers differentiated future Slovak, Czech and Polish from neighboring Slavic regions, and the denasalization differentiated Slovak and Czech from Polish. Slovak was not affected by old Polish dispalatization in the 10th century, causing differences between the two languages such as &quot;žena&quot; vs. Polish &quot;żona&quot; (a woman, a wife), &quot;kvet&quot; vs. Polish &quot;kwiat&quot;, etc. It was also not affected by the old Czech syllabic depalatization before hard syllables, with differences such as &quot;priateľ&quot; vs. Czech sg. &quot;přítel&quot;, pl. &quot;přátelé&quot; (a friend). Slovak preserved a difference between &quot;dz&quot;/&quot;z&quot; (from Proto-Slavic */dj/ */gtj/), i.e. &quot;medźa&quot; (medza, a boundary), &quot;vítäź&quot; (víťaz, an elite warrior, a winner) whereas both phonemes were transformed to ź in old Czech and dź in old Polish. Contrary to Czech, a vowel mutation from &quot;à&quot; to &quot;e&quot; did not occur in Slovak, i.e. &quot;ulica&quot; vs. Czech &quot;ulice&quot; (a street). The differences between Slovak and Czech like &quot;ťažko&quot;/&quot;těžko&quot;, &quot;cudzí&quot;/&quot;cizí&quot; became stable later. Slovak developed only single &quot;r&quot; in contrast with Czech pairs &quot;r&quot;/&quot;ř&quot; and Polish &quot;r&quot;/&quot;rz&quot;. Slovak evolved as an independent language already from the 10th century, and there is strong evidence against theories of its early or late formation from other languages.

====Contraction====
Contraction was a change caused by a loss of &quot;j&quot; between vowels and their merging into one long vowel, for example &quot;dobroje&quot; → &quot;dobré&quot; (good) and &quot;bojati sę&quot; → &quot;báť sa&quot; (to be afraid). The contraction originated in the territory of Great Moravia in the last years of its existence and divided the Slavic territory into contraction and non-contraction areas. In Proto-Slovak, the contraction occurred before the disappearance and vocalization of yers, but not uniformly. In later Western and Eastern Slovak dialects, the change was similar to other West Slavic languages. The Central Slovak shares some old features with the South-Slavic contraction peripheral territory. The Central Slovak preserved more non-contracted forms (i.e. &quot;moja&quot;, &quot;moje&quot; vs. &quot;má&quot;, &quot;mé&quot;, &quot;bojati sa&quot; /dialect/ vs &quot;báť sa&quot;). The different process of contraction &quot;oje&quot; → &quot;oe&quot; → &quot;ô&quot; probably resulted also to the characteristic neuter adjective ending &quot;-ô&quot; (i.e. &quot;dobrô&quot; vs. &quot;dobré&quot;).

====Loss and vocalization of yers====
The disappearance of weak yers and the change of strong yers is reconstructed by Havlík&#x27;s law. The back yer (ъ) was vocalized as &quot;e&quot; in the Proto-Slavic basis of Western and Eastern Slovak (&quot;pętъkъ&quot; → &quot;pátek:&quot; Friday) and as &quot;o&quot; in the Central Slovak area (&quot;piatok&quot;). The weak yers did not disappear in one syllable words, but the back yer changed to &quot;a,&quot; and the front yer, to &quot;ä&quot;. This change occurred already in the 10th century like in other West Slavic languages, contrary to the neighboring East Slavic area.

====Denasalization====
The Proto-Slavic nasal vowels &quot;ǫ&quot; and &quot;ę&quot; were denasalized in the 10th century. The nasal vowel &quot;ǫ&quot; was replaced by &quot;u&quot; and &quot;ú&quot;, i.e. &quot;zǫbъ &gt; zub&quot; (a tooth), &quot;lǫka &gt; lúka&quot; (a meadow) probably through an extinct nasal vowel &quot;ų&quot;: &quot;ǫ &gt; ų &gt; u/ú&quot;. The denasalization of &quot;ę&quot; was similar: &quot;ę &gt; ą̈ &gt; ä/a̋&quot;. These forms from the 11th–12th centuries have been preserved in some Slovak dialects until the modern age (Orava, Gemer and Sotak dialects). The central Slovak dialects preserved only the short form &quot;ä&quot;. In other dialects, they changed to wide range of monophthongs and diphthongs.

===Phonology===
====Changes in prosodic features====
The Proto-Slavic quantity was associated with specific vowels (long &quot;a&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;ě&quot;, &quot;ę&quot;, &quot;ǫ&quot; vs. short &quot;o&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;ъ&quot;, &quot;ь&quot;). The original quantity has disappeared or changed, creating pairs of short and long vowels &quot;a&quot;/&quot;á&quot;, &quot;e&quot;/&quot;é&quot;, etc.

====The spirantization of Slavic /g/ to /h/====
Early Slovak inherited the velar &quot;g&quot; from Proto-Slavic. The velar was preserved in the early stage of development, but it changed to &quot;h&quot; approximately in the 12th century. Unlike Czech, this change was not complete, and the original &quot;g&quot; has been preserved in the &quot;-zg&quot; consonant group at the end of words and on the border of morphemes, e.g. &quot;mozgy&quot; vs. Czech &quot;mozky&quot; (brains). The partial preservation of &quot;g&quot; in the phonetic system allowed Slovak to adopt &quot;g&quot; in later loanwords, for example &quot;gombík&quot; (a button).

===Morphology===
====Grammatical numbers====
In contrast to modern Slovak, early Slovak had three grammatical numbers inherited from Proto-Slavic, singular, plural and dual. Dual was probably never fully developed and was extinct already in the 14th century. Dual forms were recorded mostly in documents from Western and partially from Central Slovakia, but their usage in the 15th–16th centuries was limited to words that naturally come in pairs (ears, eyes, etc.) and words derived from the number two. However, they were already garbled or outnumbered by plural forms.

====Grammatical tenses====
Simplification of grammatical tenses had been an overall trend in the development of Slovak. Old Proto-Slavic past tenses, the aorist, the imperfect and the old pluperfect disappeared, probably in the 13th–14th centuries. The perfect and the new pluperfect become stable. Different expressions for the future tense were simplified in one stable form, e.g. &quot;mám/chcu/začnu/budu robiti&quot; → &quot;budu robiti&quot;, later &quot;budem robiť&quot; (I will do).

====Noun declension====
Unlike neighbouring Slavic languages, Slovak retained only six out of seven Proto-Slavic grammatical cases. The vocative merged with the nominative, but it has been preserved in archaic forms of some words related to family, e.g. &quot;otec&quot; → &quot;otče&quot;, &quot;syn&quot; → &quot;synu&quot;, &quot;kmotor&quot; → &quot;kmotre&quot; (O father/son/godfather) and to address God: &quot;Boh&quot; → &quot;Bože&quot;, &quot;Ježiš&quot; → &quot;Ježišu&quot;, &quot;Kristus&quot; → &quot;Kriste&quot; (O God/Jesus/Christ). Slovak retained basic principles of declension, but the evolution of declension paradigms had been strongly affected by the principle of analogy: less frequent declension suffixes were replaced by more frequent suffixes from other cases and paradigms. The outcome of this process was simplification and higher uniformity of declension patterns. This process was more intense compared to Czech. The independent development of Slovak naturally resulted in unique declension patterns.

==History of standard language==
===Pre-standard period===
The earliest written records of Slovak are represented by personal and place names, later by sentences, short notes and verses in Latin and Czech documents. Latin documents contain also mentions about a cultivation of the vernacular language. The complete texts are available since the 15th century. In the 15th century, Latin began to lose its privileged position in favor of Czech and cultural Slovak.

====Early pre-standard period====
=====Old Church Slavonic=====
The Old Church Slavonic became the literary and liturgical language, and the Glagolitic alphabet the corresponding script in Great Moravia until 885. Latin continues to be used in parallel. Some of the early Old Church Slavonic texts (based on emerging southern Slavic dialects) contain western Slavic elements of the language of the Slavic inhabitants of Great Moravia and Pannonia, which were called the Sloviene (&quot;*Slověne&quot;) by Slavic texts at that time.
The use of Old Church Slavonic in Great Moravia was prohibited by Pope Stephen V in 885; consequently, Latin became the administrative and liturgical language again. Many followers and students of Constantine and Methodius fled to Bulgaria, Croatia, Bohemia, the Kievan Rus&#x27; and other countries.

====Older and younger pre-standard period====
=====Slovak in Latin Documents=====
From the 10th century onward, Slovak began to develop independently. Very few written records of Old Slovak remain, mainly from the 13th century onwards, consisting of groups of words or single sentences. Fuller Slovak texts appeared starting from 15th century. Old Slovak and its development can be researched mainly through old Slovak toponyms occurring in Latin texts. Examples include &quot;crali&quot; (1113) &gt; &quot;kráľ&quot;, &#x27;king&#x27;; &quot;dorz&quot; (1113) &gt; &quot;dvorec&quot;, &#x27;court&#x27;; &quot;grinchar&quot; (1113) &gt; &quot;hrnčiar&quot;, &#x27;potter&#x27;; &quot;mussenic&quot; (1113) &gt; &quot;mučeník&quot;, &#x27;martyr&#x27;; &quot;scitar&quot; (1113) &gt; &quot;štítar&quot;, &#x27;shieldmaker&#x27;; &quot;zaltinc&quot; (1156) &gt; &quot;zlatník&quot;, &#x27;goldmaker&#x27;; &quot;duor&quot; (1156) &gt; &quot;dvor&quot;, &#x27;courtyard&#x27;; and &quot;otroč&quot; (1156) &gt; &quot;otrok&quot;, &#x27;slave, servant&#x27;. In 1294, the monk Ivanka from Kláštor pod Znievom wrote: &quot;ad parvam arborem nystra slowenski breza ubi est meta&quot;. It is important mainly because it contains the oldest recorded adjective &quot;Slovak&quot; in Slovak, whose modern form is &quot;slovensky&quot;. Up until this point, all adjectives were recorded mainly in Latin, including &quot;sclavus&quot;, &quot;slavus&quot; and &quot;sclavoniae&quot;.

=====Czech and Slovakized Czech=====
Written Czech started to penetrate into present-day Slovakia through Czech clergy teaching in capitular schools in the 14th century. In the pre-standard period, Czech was used along with Latin and cultural Slovak as a cultural and liturgical language. The reasons for the use of Czech were the absence of a uniform Slovak standard due to the absence of a Slovak state, whereas Czech was a standardized language which enjoyed a certain degree of prestige, particularly in the context of the Protestant Reformation; the rise of the Slovak population in towns; the similarity to Slovak making it easier to learn; studies of many Slovaks at the University of Prague; the influence of the campaigns of the Czech Hussites and of John Giskra (Ján Jiskra) in Upper Hungary; and the temporary conquest of Moravia by the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus.

The usage of Czech in a Slovak environment resulted in Slovakized Czech, a variant of cultural Czech with Slovak elements. This variant existed from the penetration of Czech to present-day Slovakia and was used in city books and official correspondence. Early writings had a varying frequency of Slovak elements caused by a poor knowledge of standard Czech among many Slovak native speakers and the influence of vernacular language and cultural Slovak. The normalized form of Slovakized Czech existed from the 17th century. In it, Czech letters and words were systematically replaced by their Slovak equivalents (e.g. &quot;ř&quot; by &quot;r&quot;, &quot;ě&quot; by &quot;e&quot;, &quot;au&quot; by &quot;ú&quot;, &quot;ou&quot; by &quot;ú&quot;, etc.).

=====Biblical Czech=====
Czech was recognized as an official language of the Lutheran Church by the councils in 1610 and 1614 and was used as a liturgical language even until the early 20th century. The official form was biblical Czech used in the Czech Bible of Kralice. The orthography of Hussite &quot;Brothers in the Law of Christ&quot; was used also in Catholic publications but often adjusted to cultural Slovak.

=====Kollár&#x27;s &quot;Old Slovak&quot;=====
Slovak humanist Ján Kollár and Andrej Ľudovít Radlinský attempted to standardize a new standard language called Old Slovak (staroslovenčina), a version of Slovakized Czech. According to the contemporary Pan-Slavic views, the Slavic nation consisted of four tribes, the Czechoslovak, the Polish, the Russian and the Illyrian (Southern Slavs). Kollár assumed a common origin of Czechs and Slovaks. The original language, he claimed, is closer to Slovak, with Czech allegedly losing its beauty due to contact with German. After the suppressing of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, Kollár got an approval of the government in Vienna to use &quot;Old Slovak&quot; as an administrative and educational language. The trial to create a common standard language for Czechs and Slovaks failed. Czechs had difficulties understanding Kollár&#x27;s &quot;improvements&quot; of Czech by Slovakisms, and the younger Slovak generation preferred standardization of Slovak.

=====Cultural Western, Central and Eastern Slovak=====
Catholics use Western Slovak (Cultured Western Slovak, Jesuit Slovak) based on the language used by educated people from the region of Trnava, where the important Jesuit University of Trnava was founded in 1635, and in the profane sphere, especially in towns, Slovak influenced by the Czech is used even in written documents, often with a chaotic orthography.

After the defeat of the Turks near Vienna in 1683, many Slovaks gradually emigrated to the Lower Lands, territories in present-day Hungary, Serbia (later to Croatia and Bulgaria), and Romania was depopulated after the Turkish occupation. They have preserved their particular Slovak dialects until today. In eastern Slovakia, a Slovakized standard Polish is used sometimes (besides Czech, Slovak and Latin) for the same purposes and reasons as Czech is used in the remaining Slovakia. Latin continues to be used, especially in state administration.

Efforts to establish Slovak as the standard language emerged as early as in the 17th century. For example, in &quot;The Czech Grammar&quot; (1603), Vavrinec Benedikt of Nedožery incites the Slovaks to deepen their knowledge of Slovak. Matej Bel in the introduction to the &quot;Gramatica Slavico-Bohemica&quot; (1745) of Pavel Doležal compares Slovak with other recognized languages. Literary activity in Slovak flourished during the second half of the seventeenth century and continued into the next century. In the mid-18th century Camaldolese monks translated the Bible in a variant of language named after them, while Romuald Hadvabný of Červený Kláštor proposed a detailed (Western Slovak) language codification in his Latin-Slovak Dictionary (1763) with an outline of the Slovak grammar. The first adventure novel in Slovak, the &quot;René mláďenca príhodi a skúsenosťi,&quot; was published in 1783 by Jozef Ignác Bajza in Western Slovak.

===Standard period===
====Bernolák&#x27;s standard====

Anton Bernolák, a Catholic priest (1762–1813), published the &quot;Dissertatio philologico-critica de litteris Slavorum&quot; in 1787, in which he codified a Slovak standard based on the Western Slovak of the University of Trnava but contains also some central Slovak elements, e.g. soft consonants &quot;ď&quot;, &quot;ť&quot;, &quot;ň&quot;, &quot;ľ&quot; and many words. The orthography is strictly diacritical. The language is often called Bernolák&#x27;s language. Bernolák continued his codification work in other books in the 1780s and 1790s and especially in his huge six-volume &quot;Slovak-Czech-Latin-German-Hungarian Dictionary,&quot; in print from 1825 to 1927. In the 1820s, the Bernolák standard was revised, and Central Slovak elements were systematically replaced by their Western Slovak equivalents.

This was the first successful establishment of a standard Slovak. Bernolák&#x27;s language was used by Slovak Catholics, especially by the writers Juraj Fándly and Ján Hollý, but Protestants still wrote in Czech in its old form used in Bohemia until the 17th century.

====Štúr&#x27;s standard====

In 1843, young Slovak Lutheran Protestants, led by Ľudovít Štúr, decided to establish and discuss the central Slovak dialect as the new Slovak standard instead of both Bernolák&#x27;s language used by the Catholics and Czech used by older Slovak Lutheran Protestants. The new standard was also accepted by some users of Bernolák&#x27;s language led by Ján Hollý, but was initially criticized by the older Lutheran Protestants led by Ján Kollár (died 1852). This language formed the basis of the later standard Slovak that is used today. The first Slovak grammar of the new language was published by Ľudovít Štúr in 1846 with the title &quot;Nauka reči Slovenskej&quot; (The Theory of the Slovak Language).

In 1844, the Hungarian Diet of Pozsony (today Bratislava) replaced Latin, used since the Middle Ages, with Hungarian as the official language of Hungary, which included at the time what later became Slovakia.

====Hodža-Hattala reform====
In 1851, the supporters of Bernolák and Štúr made a compromise and agreed on the reform of the Štúr&#x27;s standard. The new standard respected etymological principles instead of Štúr&#x27;s phonetic-phonological transcription and used a Slovak orthography closer to other Slavic languages, especially Czech. The new grammar was published by Martin Hattala in 1852.

====Martin period, practice and Czambel&#x27;s codification====

The Martin period lasted from the abolishment of the Slovak national and cultural institution Matica slovenská until the foundation of Czechoslovakia in 1918. The name comes from Turčiansky Svätý Martin, the contemporary Slovak cultural center. The usage of Slovak in education and culture was significantly reduced during forced Magyarization after the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867.

The Martin practice () was a &quot;de facto&quot; standard partially formed already before the abolishment of Matica and influenced by the dialect spoken in Martin. In 1902, Samuel Czambel published new language standard. Czambel&#x27;s codification favored the forms used in spoken language to archaisms from Hattala&#x27;s codification and synchronized spoken and written language. Czambel&#x27;s codification was partially revised and extended by Jozef Škultéty.

====Czechoslovakia (1918–1939)====
With the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918, Slovak became an official language for the first time in history along with Czech. The Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920 and the constitutional law on minorities which was adopted alongside the constitution on the same day established the Czechoslovak language as an official language Since the Czechoslovak language did not exist, the law recognized its two variants, Czech and Slovak. Czech was usually used in administration in the Czech lands; Slovak, in Slovakia. In practice, the position of languages was not equal. Along with political reasons, this situation was caused by a different historical experience and numerous Czech teachers and clerks in Slovakia, who helped to restore the educational system and administration because Slovaks educated in Slovak were missing.

In 1931, the Matica slovenská published a new standard Slovak prepared by Czech linguist Václav Vážný, the head of the Department of Linguistics of Matica. In contrast with older works including those published in Czechoslovakia, the standard had an official character and was approved and recommended by the Ministry of Education led by Slovak minister Ivan Dérer. The standard was inspired by the official ideology of Czechoslovakism and tried to align both languages by the codification of numerous Czech words and forms not existing in Slovak. It raised negative reactions, and the board of Matica promised its revision. Although a new official standard was not published before the breakup of Czechoslovakia in 1939, a new standard of Matica was used along with Vážný&#x27;s standard.

====Czechoslovakia (1945–1992)====
The six-volume &quot;Slovník slovenského jazyka&quot; (Slovak Dictionary, SSJ) was written during 1959–1968. The federalization of Czechoslovakia in 1968 confirmed equal rights for Slovak and Czech in the Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia and later the Fifth Republic of Czechoslovakia.

====Slovak Republic====
Czechoslovakia split into Slovakia and the Czech Republic in 1993. Slovak became the official language of Slovakia.

<text>New College of Florida is a public liberal arts college in Sarasota, Florida. The college is a member of the Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges. New College has the smallest student enrollment in the State University System of Florida with 689 students as of 2022. Founded in 1960, it opened in 1964 and was a private college. It ran into financial difficulty in the 1970s and was merged into the University of South Florida. In 2001, it became an autonomous college within the State University System of Florida.

In 2023, the state government of Florida overhauled its board of trustees in an attempt to transform the honors college into a conservative institution modeled on Hillsdale College. Afterward, nearly 40% of the faculty resigned. 

== History ==
New College was founded in 1960 as a private college for academically talented students. Financial assistance was provided by the United Church of Christ. George F. Baughman served as the first president from 1961 to 1965.

Open to students of all races, genders, and religious affiliations, New College opened its doors in 1964 to a premier class of 101 students. Faculty members included the historian and philosopher Arnold J. Toynbee, who left retirement to join the charter faculty.

The school offered a liberal arts education valuing freedom of inquiry, where individual students were responsible for their own education, implemented through a unique academic program.

By 1972, more than 500 students studied at New College. As the 1970s progressed, inflation threatened to undermine the economic viability of the institution. By 1975, the college was $3.9 million in debt and on the brink of insolvency. At that time, the University of South Florida (USF) expressed interest in buying the land and facilities of the college to establish a branch campus there. The school merged with USF as a separate &quot;upper division campus&quot; within the public university.

In an unusual agreement, the New College board of trustees agreed to hand over the school&#x27;s campus and other assets to the state, at the time valued at $8.5 million, in exchange for the state paying off its debts and agreeing to continue to operate the school as a separate unit within the USF system. The agreement stated that New College was to receive the same funding, per-student, as other programs at USF. The former New College board of trustees became the New College Foundation, and was required to raise money privately to supplement the state funds to reach the total necessary to run New College, at the time about a third of New College&#x27;s $2-million-a-year operating budget. Under that agreement, New College was renamed the &quot;New College of the University of South Florida&quot;. USF started a Sarasota branch program that shared the bayfront campus, and the schools began an uneasy relationship that would last for the next twenty-five years, with New College and the University of South Florida through its Sarasota branch program sharing the campus.

In 2001 it became an autonomous college, the eleventh independent school of the State University System of Florida as the honors college for the state system. As part of a major reorganization of Florida&#x27;s public education system in 2001, New College severed its ties with USF, became the eleventh independent school in the State University System of Florida, and adopted its current name, New College of Florida. The Florida legislature officially designated New College as the honors college for the state of Florida. The school&#x27;s unusual academic system was also encoded in statute: &quot;To provide programs of study that allow students to design their educational experience as much as possible in accordance with their individual interests, values, and abilities.&quot; As part of its establishment as an independent university, the University of South Florida was directed to relocate its facilities away from the New College campus, which it did on August 28, 2006, when it opened a new campus for USF Sarasota-Manatee on the undeveloped &quot;Seagate portion&quot; of the campus. With conditions including that neither institution would build on the undeveloped bayfront property, the Uplands Preserve, that New College owned independently by a donation from the subdivision neighborhood when the private college was being founded, New College divided the property and allowed USF Sarasota-Manatee to take possession of a portion of the preserve that is north of the city limit. New College and USF Sarasota-Manatee continued to share campuses until the new campus was completed and thereafter, certain facilities such as the library remained shared.

For the 2010-2011 academic year, New College had the highest percentage of students receiving a Fulbright scholarship of any college or university in the United States.

=== 2023 appointment of conservative trustees ===
In early 2023, Governor Ron DeSantis overhauled the college&#x27;s board of trustees, appointing six new members including Christopher Rufo, Matthew Spalding, Charles R. Kesler, Mark Bauerlein, Debra Jenks, and Eddie Speir. Of those, the first four are well-known conservative activists who appear to live outside Florida. The DeSantis chief of staff, James Uthmeier, said that &quot;It is our hope that New College of Florida will become Florida’s classical college, more along the lines of a Hillsdale of the South.&quot; At its first meeting, on January 31, 2023, the new board fired President Patricia Okker (&quot;without cause&quot;) and installed Richard Corcoran, a political associate of the governor, as its interim . These actions received national attention and commentary.

Early changes included firing the university president, dissolving the university&#x27;s diversity and equity office, banning personal pronouns in email signatures by faculty, and cancelling events promoting diversity and inclusion. Christopher Rufo was reported as having announced: &quot;We will be shutting down low-performing, ideologically-captured academic departments and hiring new faculty&quot; and &quot;The student body will be recomposed over time: some current students will self-select out, others will graduate; we&#x27;ll recruit new students who are mission-aligned.&quot;

According to NPR, &quot;Professors at the New College of Florida are using personal email because they&#x27;re afraid of being subpoenaed. Students are concerned, too. Some fear for their physical safety. Many worry their teachers will be fired en masse and their courses and books will be policed. It&#x27;s increasingly hard to focus on their studies.&quot;

In April 2023, the board of trustees denied tenure to five professors, sparking outcry from the attending audience and leading to the resignation of trustee and faculty chair Matthew Lepinski. When asked to provide reasons for the decision, interim president Richard Corcoran argued for the denial or delay of tenure due to administrative changes and the college&#x27;s shift towards a more traditional liberal arts focus. Mark Bauerlein argued against granting tenure because the five professors were seeking tenure after meeting all requirements in five years rather than six, claiming that receiving tenure after five years is unusual, and stating that he would apply different criteria if the faculty stand for tenure again after another year. However, the faculty handbook states that the criteria for tenure are identical regardless of year, and around 30% of New College faculty hired in the past decade have received tenure after five years. 

The professors, two organic chemists, an Islamic historian, a Latin American/Caribbean historian, and an oceanographer, had already gained approval for their tenure applications from New College faculty, external reviewers, and the previous administration; they were denied in identical 6-4 votes with the new conservative board members forming the majority. This move was criticized by some as part of a larger trend of conservatives targeting tenure, particularly for professors perceived to hold liberal views. Four of the five professors were awarded tenure the subsequent year, alongside two others applying for tenure for the first time. 

Hugo Viera-Vargas, the specialist in Latin American and Caribbean history and the sole professor permanently denied tenure, was identified by President Richard Corcoran as having insufficient class sizes to qualify for tenure. Viera-Vargas was also the sole New College professor who had taken legal action, serving as a plaintiff in a lawsuit against SB266, a comprehensive higher education bill from Governor Ron DeSantis that also eliminated arbitration in university employment disputes.

In May 2023, the college fired librarian Helene Gold, drawing criticism from faculty and students. Gold, the second LGBTQ+ employee terminated in the same year, referred to her firing as a &quot;deliberate and targeted attack on our students who need support now more than ever&quot;. Later that month, New College students successfully fundraised over $100,000 for an alternative commencement ceremony. The event was created in protest of the college&#x27;s conservative takeover and the inclusion of Scott Atlas, a top advisor to former president Donald Trump during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the college&#x27;s keynote speaker for its end-of-year graduation ceremony. National civil rights activist Maya Wiley delivered the keynote speech at the alternative ceremony, commending students for their advocacy whilst referencing the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act. Patricia Okker, the former president of New College who was fired after the college&#x27;s conservative overhaul, gave a brief address. The college&#x27;s recently dismissed librarian, Helene Gold, spoke at the event and received a standing ovation.

By mid-July 2023, over a third of the existing faculty had left the college, many choosing to resign or take a leave of absence as a direct result of the conservative takeover. Of those who left, some attempted to form an alternative called &quot;Alt New College&quot;, which was threatened by a lawsuit by New College of Florida in late 2023. The alternative would end up renaming to AltLiberalArts following the lawsuit.

All of the six trustees appointed by DeSantis were eventually confirmed by the Florida Senate except Eddie Speir, a co-founder of a local Christian academy. Speir blamed the school&#x27;s new interim president for the Senate&#x27;s rejection in early May.

In October 2023, when formally announced as New College&#x27;s new president, Corcoran&#x27;s total annual compensation of more than $1 million dollars drew scrutiny from media and experts in academic and executive compensation, due to disproportionate excessive pay for the president of a public university with a small student body population.

In November 2023, New College requested $400 million in state funding to transform the school, more than $500,000 per student.

=== 2024 book dumping ===
In August 2024, the &quot;Sarasota Herald-Tribune&quot; reported the college dumped hundreds of books from its library and now-defunct Gender and Diversity Center. According to the newspaper, students were previously allowed to purchase books before they were removed from the college&#x27;s library, but were not notified this time. Following the report, the college released a statement claiming the dumping was part of its standard &#x27;weeding&#x27; process, and that they were precluded from &quot;selling, donating or transferring these materials&quot;, citing Chapter 273 of the Florida Statutes. However, the &quot;Sarasota Herald-Tribune&quot; pointed out the cited statute explicitly allows New College to dispose of state-funded personal property through sale, donation, or transfer. Amy Reid, a faculty trustee and former director of the college&#x27;s discontinued gender studies program, alleged that staff were not given any warning regarding the discontinuation of the Gender and Diversity Center. She referred to the subsequent book removals from the center as &quot;an abhorration and a violation of what a university is supposed to be doing&quot;. Furthermore, the executive director of local activist group Social Equity Through Education Alliance (SEE) alleged officials at New College refused to work with nonprofits or shelters that were willing to bring trucks and rescue the books. The following week, New College&#x27;s dean of the library was placed on administrative leave.

In September 2024, the college fired its dean of libraries, Shannon Hausinger. In a termination letter dated August 30, the college claimed Hausinger was responsible for the book dumping and did not collaborate with administrators, nor provide records she claimed to have produced documenting each book and the reason for its disposal. Hausinger&#x27;s attorney replied that she was not involved in the disposal of books from the Gender and Diversity Center, and was continuing a book disposal project from the previous dean of libraries. Her legal representation also revealed a correspondence between Hausinger and a New College attorney, wherein Hausinger asked for advice on the proper disposal of books within Florida law.

==== Reactions ====
New College president Richard Corcoran issued a statement acknowledging frustration over the book dumping whilst criticizing media coverage. Christopher Rufo, a member of New College&#x27;s board of trustees, reposted pictures of the dumped books on Twitter and said: &quot;We abolished the gender studies program. Now we&#x27;re taking out the trash&quot;. Two spokespeople for Governor Ron DeSantis also posted statements on Twitter applauding the dumping, with press secretary Jeremy Redfern calling it &quot;putting gender studies books in the garbage&quot; and communications director Bryan Griffin referring to the dumped books as propaganda.

Outrage was voiced in the community. The ACLU of Florida criticized the book dumping, referring to it as a &quot;brazen act of censorship&quot; and &quot;direct attack on the voices of LGBTQ+ individuals&quot;.

== Governance ==
New College is governed by a 13-member board of trustees. One member is the chair of the faculty senate or equivalent, one is the student body president, six are appointed by the governor, and five are appointed by the board of governors. The appointments are subject to confirmation by the state senate and serve staggered five-year terms. This composition is specified by Section 7(c), Article IX of the state constitution. Previously, there were 12 trustees who serve staggered four-year terms. Of the twelve members, three were residents of Sarasota County and two were from Manatee County.

In December 2023, the American Association of University Professors sanctioned New College of Florida for violating standards of academic governance. In response, a spokesperson for New College of Florida called the sanction a &quot;headline grab&quot; and claimed &quot;the AAUP lacks the authority to sanction New College of Florida, or any college or university for that matter.&quot;

== Campus ==
New College&#x27;s bayfront campus is located in Sarasota, Florida, approximately south of Tampa. The primary campus is located on the former Edith and Charles Ringling estate, that is included in the first historic district established by the city that extends south to include the Caples campus of the college. The campus also includes the eastern and western portions of a plated subdivision, The Uplands, an incorporated residential neighborhood that is bounded by College Drive to the south and the Seagate property to the north, Sarasota Bay to the west, and Tamiami Trail to the east. Half of the bayfront of the primary campus is in The Uplands plat and it was donated to New College as the preserve during the original founding of New College.

The campus&#x27;s most remarkable structures are its three Florida 1920s boom time, grand-scale residences: College Hall was the home of Edith and Charles Ringling; Cook Hall was the home of Hester Ringling Lancaster Sanford; and the third, Caples Hall that was the home of Ellen and Ralph Caples. The well-appointed structures date from the early to mid-1920s, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and are similar in style to the adjacent John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art and their residence, Cà d&#x27;Zan. The homes are major aspects of the Caples&#x27;-Ringlings&#x27; Estates Historic District.

The campus is also home to several examples of high modernist architecture designed by I. M. Pei. These buildings include a complex of student residences known as &quot;Pei&quot;, a cafeteria, and a student center. The other dormitories are Dort, Goldstein, and Palmer B. Five new dormitory buildings were opened in the 2007–2008 school year.
The Jane Bancroft Cook Library is for both New College students and the University of South Florida&#x27;s Sarasota-Manatee campus. It is also a resource for Manatee Community College. The local library collection has several hundred thousand items and access to more than eleven million items through the State University Libraries system.

The Pritzker Marine Biology Research Center opened in 2001. The facility supports the biology, marine biology, and environmental sciences programs, three of the most popular fields of study at New College.

In 2005, a long range campus master plan was developed through public workshops held by several design teams with participation by students, faculty, administration, residents of the community, and staff members of local governmental agencies.

In 2011, the college opened a new Academic Center and the adjacent Robert and Beverly Koski Academic Plaza. The most recent addition to the campus, in 2017, is a 22,000-square-foot addition to the Heiser Natural Sciences Center.

== Academics ==
=== Recognition ===
Eighty-six New College students have been awarded Fulbright scholarships since the founding of the college. For 2010-11, New College was found to have the highest percentage of students receiving Fulbright scholarships than any other university or college in the United States. For 2024, &quot;U.S. News and World Report&quot; ranked New College #100 out of 211 ranked &quot;National Liberal Arts Colleges&quot;, #6 in Top Public Schools, and #32 in Best Value Schools. In 2023, &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; ranked the college #18 out of 442 ranked &quot;Liberal Arts Colleges&quot;.

===Undergraduate admissions===
In 2024, New College of Florida accepted 75.4% of undergraduate applicants, and was considered to have &quot;Very High Admission Standards&quot; with those admitted having an average 3.87 GPA and standardized test scores of an average 1230 SAT score, with a 75th percentile score of 1360, or an average 27 ACT score, with a 75th percentile score of 31.

=== Undergraduate programs ===
As an honors college, the college is distinguished by its unusual &quot;contract system&quot;, in which students are given written evaluations instead of grades and agree to semester-long contracts in which a certain number of classes must be passed. For example, in a &quot;three out of five&quot; contract, a student who failed two classes would face no penalty, although one who failed three classes would risk losing all credits for the entire semester. The system was devised to encourage academic experimentation, self-directed learning, and foster curiosity about disparate topics outside one&#x27;s usual course of study; it grew out of the school&#x27;s founding principle, as laid out by Dean and Provost John W. Gustad: &quot;In the last analysis, every student is responsible for his or her own education.&quot; New College students are required to complete an undergraduate thesis project and baccalaureate exam, during which the student presents and defends their project to a committee of professors.

=== Graduate programs ===
New College offers a master&#x27;s degree in Applied Data Science. The MS in Applied Data Science is an adaptation of the original MS in Data Science, featuring a greater focus of application to industry. The MS in Data Science was created in 2015, and began with a founding cohort of seven students. As of 2022, there were 27 students enrolled in the Applied Data Science graduate program. The MS in Applied Data Science is a two-year program, featuring a 100% employment rate upon graduation. Students of the MS in Applied Data Science program are required to complete a paid practicum during the final semester of their degree. New College undergraduates pursuing any major may apply for the 3+2 path, putting them on track to be awarded a bachelor&#x27;s degree and an MS in Applied Data Science in five years. The New College MS in Applied Data Science was ranked #25 on Fortune&#x27;s &quot;Best Master’s in Data Science Programs in 2022&quot;.

=== Cost of attendance ===
For the 2021–22 school year, tuition and fees for in-state residents amounted to $6,916. Tuition and fees for both out-of-state residents and international students totaled $29,944, or $832 per credit hour. New College charges both in-state and out-of-state residents $10,892 for room and board each academic year. For international students, the cost of room and board at New College is $12,992. These costs have been stable for several years through 2022. For master&#x27;s degree students, the cost of first-year tuition and fees is $11,383.92 for in-state residents, and $28,067.28 for out-of-state and international students. On average, New College students take on the least debt compared to undergraduates from any other school in the state university System. Only 33% of New College students took on any loans with an average loan of about $5500. At comparable institutions, 53% of students took on loans with an average loan of approximately $6300. New College offers scholarships to the majority of admitted students.

=== Cross College Alliance ===
The Cross College Alliance is composed of five institutions: New College of Florida, Ringling College of Art and Design, The Ringling/FSU, State College of Florida Sarasota-Manatee, and University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee. The alliance aims to foster community among these local organizations through shared resources. Students at New College of Florida may cross-register at any of the three other colleges in the alliance.

== Student life ==
=== New College Student Alliance ===
The New College Student Alliance (NCSA) is New College&#x27;s student government organization. &quot;Towne Meetings,&quot; held monthly, are the main forum for public debate and are open to all students, faculty, and staff.

=== Athletics ===
In 2023 in parallel with the university&#x27;s academic overhaul, New College joined the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) as a member of the Sun Conference. The school announced plans to offer 17 new sports and increase its number of student-athletes from 140 in 2023 to 350 by Fall 2027. In March 2023, Mariano Jimenez was announced as new athletic director and baseball coach.

Previously, New College of Florida offered only intercollegiate archery, esports, powerlifting, rowing, sailing, and swimming. The club sailing team is a member of the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association (SAISA). The New Crew SRQ rowing club was launched in 2021 and trains at Nathan Benderson Park. The New College powerlifting team competes in regional and state competitions against other Florida colleges and universities.

<doc id="415911" wikidata="Q7550448" url="?curid=415911" title="Social Brethren">
<text>The Social Brethren is a small body of evangelical Christians located in the Midwestern United States, the Philippines and Canada.

The Social Brethren originated in Saline County, Illinois in 1867. Frank Wright and Hiram T. Brannon were among those who led in the founding of this denomination. The major impetus behind the formation of the Social Brethren was the desire to heal the division in churches over the issue of slavery. They believed that Christians who held to the fundamental teaching of the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ should fellowship one another, regardless of their views on slavery. They considered anything more to be &quot;political preaching&quot;, which they still reject.

The leaders came from Baptist, Presbyterian, and Methodist backgrounds. The church doctrine and polity is a blend of the doctrine and polity of those churches. The ordinances are baptism and the Lord&#x27;s supper. The Social Brethren reject infant baptism, but allow a candidate to choose between immersion, pouring, or sprinkling. Immersion appears to be used in the majority of cases. Their beliefs include affirmation of the Trinity; that the Bible contains all things necessary to salvation and spiritual life; that salvation is through Jesus alone; the possibility of apostasy; the right of voting and free speech for the laity; and &quot;the impropriety of political preaching&quot;.

By 1890, they had grown to 20 churches with 913 members. Currently there are over 1,000 members in 29 congregations. In 1983, there were 26 churches with 1165 members in Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan, as well as eight churches and a mission point in the Philippines.

<text>North Texas is a term used primarily by residents of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex to refer to a geographic area of Texas, generally considered to include the area south of Oklahoma, east of Abilene, west of Paris, and north of Waco. Definitions of the region don&#x27;t typically include the sparsely populated Panhandle of Texas, which is the northernmost region of Texas bordered by New Mexico to the west and Oklahoma to the north and east.

North Texas is centered upon the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, the largest metropolitan area in Texas and the Southern United States. People in the Dallas and Fort Worth areas sometimes use the terms &quot;Metroplex&quot;, &quot;DFW&quot;, and &quot;North Texas&quot; interchangeably. However, North Texas refers to a much larger area that includes many northern rural counties along the Red River of the South border.

==History==
Indigenous tribes in North Texas included the Caddo, Tawakoni, Wichita, Kickapoo, and Comanche. With European colonization, Mexican independence, and Texan independence and annexation to the United States, many of these tribes experienced demographic decline through relocation, slavery, etc. Since European colonization and the independence movements, the North Texas area was settled and most notably developed the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth.

==Climate==
The North Texas climate is subtropical with hot summers. It is also continental, characterized by a wide annual temperature range. Average annual precipitation also varies considerably, ranging from less than 28 to more than 48 inches (700–1200 mm). Severe storms are frequent in the spring and summer, as the area lies in the southern section of &quot;tornado alley&quot;.

South is the prevailing wind direction, and southerly winds are frequently high and persist for several days. Strong northerly winds often occur during the passage of cold fronts.

Winters can be mild, but northers occur about three times each month, and often are accompanied by sudden drops in temperature. In Dallas, a record-setting 12.8 inches of snow fell in February 2010. Periods of extreme cold that occasionally occur are short-lived, so that even in January mild weather occurs frequently.

The highest temperatures of summer are associated with fair skies, and moderate to high humidities. Characteristically, hot spells in summer are broken into three- to five-day periods by thunderstorm activity. There are only a few nights each summer when the low temperature exceeds 80 °F (27 °C). Summer daytime temperatures frequently exceed 100 °F (38 °C). Air conditioners are recommended for maximum comfort indoors and while traveling via automobile.

Throughout the year, rainfall occurs more frequently during the night. Usually, periods of rainy weather last for only a day or two, and are followed by several days with fair skies. A large part of the annual precipitation results from thunderstorm activity, with occasional heavy rainfall over brief periods of time. Thunderstorms occur throughout the year, but are most frequent in the spring and early summer months. Hail falls on about two or three days a year, ordinarily with only slight and scattered damage. Windstorms occurring during thunderstorm activity are sometimes destructive. Snowfall is uncommon.

The average length of the warm season (freeze-free period) is about 249 days. The average last occurrence of 32 °F (0 °C) or below is mid March and the average first occurrence of 32 °F or below is in late November.

==Counties==

(The Texans later relocated to Kansas City and became the Chiefs). In 1972, Major League Baseball&#x27;s Washington Senators moved to Arlington to become the Texas Rangers, named after the statewide law enforcement agency. The National Basketball Association expanded into North Texas in 1980 when the Dallas Mavericks were added to the league. The fourth sport was added in 1993 when the Minnesota North Stars of the National Hockey League moved to Dallas, becoming the Dallas Stars.

The Major League Soccer team FC Dallas is based in Frisco, and the Dallas Wings of the WNBA plays in Arlington. The area is also home to many minor league professional teams and four colleges that compete in NCAA Division I athletics.

<text>Ken Silverman (born November 1, 1975) is an American game programmer, best known for writing the Build engine. It was most notably utilized by &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;, &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot;, &quot;Blood&quot;, and more than a dozen other games in the mid- to late-1990s.

Once considered the primary rival of John Carmack (later succeeded by Tim Sweeney), Silverman started work on the Build engine sometime before his first semester at Brown University in 1993, under a contract with Apogee Software. In the wake of &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; and other Build engine games, Silverman left the commercial game industry.

Silverman has been CTO and co-founder of Ardfry Imaging, LLC responsible for the PNG Compression tool PNGOUT. He is the founder and Chief Computer Scientist of VOXON, makers of the world&#x27;s most advanced 3D volumetric display system.

== Projects ==

=== Ken&#x27;s Labyrinth ===

&quot;Ken&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot; is a first-person shooter video game coded by Silverman. It was originally released in 1993 as shareware by Epic MegaGames. The source code to the project and even older versions can now be found on Silverman&#x27;s website.

=== Build engine ===

The Build engine is a first-person shooter engine created by Ken Silverman for 3D Realms from 1993 to 1996. The engine was used in a number of popular games of the era, and its source code was released on June 20, 2000. Shortly after the &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; source code was released in 2003, Silverman added the Polymost renderer to the Build engine. From 2006 to 2011 he prototyped a successor to the engine, titled Build2. He released his drafts for the engine on March 7, 2018.

=== Voxlap ===
In 2000, Silverman started work on Voxlap, a voxel-driven graphics engine. In addition to the engine, a Voxlap-powered tech demo was produced in cooperation with Tom Dobrowolski. Since 2003, development on the engine has been fairly static, the source code to the engine was released by Silverman in 2005, allowing commercial derivatives with permission. &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;, a 2011 online multiplayer shooter, was developed from the Voxlap engine.

=== Other projects ===
Other creations by Silverman include the ZIP file archiver KZIP, the EVALDRAW programming environment, and the PNG file-size optimizer PNGOUT. In 2006, a GUI-driven version of PNGOUT known as PNGOUTWin was released by Ardfry Imaging, a small company Silverman co-founded in 2005.

===Voxon Photonics===
In early 2013, Silverman joined Voxon Photonics as Chief Computer Scientist. His role is primarily that of programming the volumetric graphics engine for the Voxiebox, a swept surface volumetric display being described by Voxon as &quot;the world&#x27;s first holographic arcade game system&quot;. The Voxiebox is capable of generating points of light within a volume of space, and in doing so enables the creation of 3D multiplayer gaming experiences that can be viewed from any angle without special glasses.

<doc id="415914" wikidata="Q4917201" url="?curid=415914" title="Bisbee Blue">
<text>Bisbee Blue or Bisbee turquoise refers to the turquoise that comes from copper mines located in the vicinity of Bisbee, Arizona. Bisbee turquoise can be found in many different shades of color and quality, from soft, low quality pale blue, to the quality hard brilliant blue turquoise and almost every shade of blue in between. The highest grade of Bisbee Blue turquoise is almost lapis lazuli blue and has a brownish-red spiderweb matrix. Green turquoise is also found in Bisbee.

==History==
===Discovery===
Though small amounts of turquoise were found in the Campbell shaft mine, as well as in stream beds in the Mule Mountains, the vast majority of Bisbee turquoise surfaced when the Phelps Dodge Corporation started open pit mining operations at the location now known as the Lavender Pit, especially the eastern side of the pit. Large amounts of a conglomerate rock bed needed to be removed before the copper ore located more deeply could be reached. This sedimentary conglomerate &quot;waste&quot; rock was the host for most of the turquoise, in both vein and nugget form.

===Recovery===
During the time that the largest quantities of turquoise were being extracted from the mine, the company made no organized effort to recover it. It simply got loaded into large dump trucks and hauled off to the &quot;dumps&quot;. During this time (primarily from the late 1950s to the late 1960s), some of the recovered turquoise was obtained by company employees taking it home in their lunch boxes, etc. Though this activity was prohibited, the prohibition was rarely enforced. For several years (mostly the early to late 1970s), these individuals, locally known as &quot;dumpers&quot;, were the only source for this fine turquoise aside from those who were granted exclusive access to collect turquoise existing in the mine dumps during a set day annually for a marginal fee. 

During this time, Phelps Dodge leased out the dumps to Bob Matthews. Matthews and associates were the only legal miners of the Bisbee turquoise and other copper minerals in history besides the annual dig pass holders. Matthews sold large lots to the famous artists the Zacharys from Albuquerque, New Mexico, the owners of the Turquoise Museum in Albuquerque, John Hartman in Durango, Colorado, and many other famous artists and traders. Some of Matthews&#x27; turquoise was sent to Durango to be made into jewelry by his brother-in-law Cecil Mickelson&#x27;s jewelry company. The company made Bisbee Blue and Villa Grove inlay turquoise jewelry up until the 1980s. In the early 2000s the Durango Silver Company, bought what was thought to be left of the Bob Matthews/Cecil Mickelson Collection of Bisbee turquoise. This collection amounted to approximately of rough Bisbee turquoise. Still, numerous reputable artists and suppliers continue to sell what remains of the exquisite and highly collectible turquoise from Bisbee.

<doc id="415915" wikidata="Q17176647" url="?curid=415915" title="Cornucopianism">
<text>Cornucopianism is the idea that continued supply of the material needs of humankind can be achieved through continued advances in technology. It contends that there is enough matter and energy available for practically unlimited growth.

The term comes from the cornucopia, the &quot;horn of plenty&quot; of Greek mythology, which magically supplied its owners with endless food and drink. Adherents are called &quot;cornucopians&quot; or sometimes &quot;boomsters,&quot; in contrast to doomsters, whose views are more aligned with Malthusianism.&quot;

==Theory==
As a society becomes more wealthy, it also creates a well-developed set of legal rules to produce the conditions of freedom and security that progress requires.

In &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot; written in 1879, after describing the powerful reproductive forces of nature, the political economist Henry George wrote, &quot;That the earth could maintain a thousand billions of people as easily as a thousand millions is a necessary deduction from the manifest truths that, at least so far as our agency is concerned, matter is eternal and force must forever continue to act.&quot;

Julian Simon was one of the best known cornucopian thinkers in modern times who suggested in his book, &quot;The Ultimate Resource&quot;, published in 1981, that humans have always found a way in the past to develop and enhance past resources over virtually any roadblock. He suggested that while resources may come and go, the knowledge that can come from a bigger population, and thus more manpower/intellect, humanity would continuously be able to find newer sources of energy. Simon did argue however that in order for humans to seek innovation and new sources of energy, free markets must be present to place value on sources of energy through their price to produce and use. Once the price of a certain resource become too high due to lack of supply, it would encourage new research into alternative sources to seek cheaper energy. 

==Description by an opposing view==

Stereotypically, a cornucopian is someone who posits that there are few intractable natural limits to growth and believes the world can provide a practically limitless abundance of natural resources. The label &quot;cornucopian&quot; is rarely self-applied, and is most commonly used derogatorily by those who view this perspective as overly optimistic about the resources that will be available in the future.

One common example of this labeling is by those who are skeptical of the view that technology can solve, or overcome, the problem of an exponentially-increasing human population living off a finite base of natural resources. Cornucopians might counter that human population growth has slowed dramatically, and not only is currently growing at a linear rate, but is projected to peak and start declining in the second half of the 21st century. As of 2024
the global population is expected to peak in the mid 2080&#x27;s around 10.3 billion people and fall to 10.2 by the end of the 21st century.

==Criticism==
Lindsey Grant accuses cornucopians, especially Julian Simon and Herman Kahn, of making arguments with logical flaws, omissions and oversights and of making assumptions and choosing methodologies that ignore or dismiss the most critical issues. Historian of science Naomi Oreskes criticized cornucopianism, arguing that while there were technological innovations to increase agricultural productivity for a growing world, &quot;the cornucopian perspective ignores other important facts&quot;, such as that &quot;an enormous number of these inventions&quot; such as gains in health and life expectancy, &quot;came into being through government actions&quot;, and arguing that &quot;technological progress has not stopped the unfolding climate crisis.&quot;

<text>The Sign of the Four, also called The Sign of Four, is an 1890 detective novel, and it is the second novel featuring Sherlock Holmes by British writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Doyle wrote four novels and 56 short stories featuring the fictional detective.

==Plot==
In 1888 Miss Mary Morstan arrives with a case. She explains that ten years earlier, her father, Captain Arthur Morstan, disappeared immediately after arriving in London. Mary contacted his friend, Major Sholto, who denied having seen him. Four years later, she received a valuable pearl in the post, a gift repeated once a year for six years. With the sixth pearl, she received a letter asking for a meeting, claiming that she is a &quot;wronged woman&quot;. 

Holmes takes the case, and soon discovers that Major Sholto had died a week before Mary received the first pearl. The only further clue Mary can give Holmes is a map of a fortress found in her father&#x27;s desk, appended with the words &quot;The Sign of the Four: Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, Dost Akbar,&quot; and four small cross-like symbols.

Following the letter&#x27;s instructions, Holmes, Watson, and Mary go to the Lyceum Theatre; there, they meet a coachman who takes them to the house of Major Sholto&#x27;s son Thaddeus, the anonymous sender of the pearls. He reveals that Captain Morstan did, in fact, visit Major Sholto, demanding his half of a treasure that Sholto had secretly brought back from India. In the ensuing quarrel, Captain Morstan suffered a heart attack and died, striking his head on the treasure box as he fell. Afraid he would be suspected of murder, Major Sholto buried the body and hid the treasure, leaving out a small gold chaplet studded with twelve pearls. Thaddeus and his twin brother Bartholomew only learned of this when their father revealed it while on his deathbed; he was about to reveal to them where the treasure was hidden, when a bearded man appeared at the window and the Major died of fear. The brothers tried and failed to catch the intruder; later on, they found a note pinned to the Major&#x27;s body, which read &quot;The Sign of Four&quot;. Thaddeus began sending Mary the pearls to make things right, and the brothers searched for the treasure. Six years later, Bartholomew found and withheld it; Thaddeus then contacted Mary so they could both confront Bartholomew and demand their shares.

The party, now accompanied by Thaddeus, heads to Bartholomew&#x27;s house, Pondicherry Lodge, Upper Norwood. As they enter the house, the worried housekeeper reveals that Bartholomew has locked himself in his laboratory and refuses to come out. Mary Morstan stays downstairs to comfort the housekeeper, while the others rush up to the laboratory door; through the keyhole, they can see Bartholomew Sholto slumped in his chair, with a &quot;fixed and unnatural grin&quot; upon his face. Holmes and Watson break down the door, to discover Bartholomew in a state of &quot;rigor mortis&quot;. Upon further inspection of the body, Holmes discovers a poisonous thorn above Bartholomew&#x27;s ear. The treasure box is also gone, though there is a hole in the ceiling where it used to be. 

While the police wrongly take Thaddeus in as a suspect, Holmes deduces from footmarks and other clues that there are two persons involved in the murder: a one-legged white man named Jonathan Small, and a small Andamanese accomplice, who accidentally stepped in creosote. Borrowing Toby, a trained scent hound, from a naturalist, Holmes traces the pair to a boat landing. Learning that Small has hired a steam launch named the &quot;Aurora&quot;, Holmes, with the help of the Baker Street Irregulars and his own disguises, traces the boat to a repair yard. In a police launch, Holmes and Watson pursue the &quot;Aurora&quot; when it flees the yard; the islander attempts to shoot a dart at Holmes, and is shot dead himself. Small attempts to flee, running the &quot;Aurora&quot; aground, but is captured. However, the treasure box is now empty; Small, not wanting to surrender the gems, had scattered them into the Thames during the chase.

Small confesses that he was once a soldier of the Third Buffs in India, and lost his right leg to a crocodile while bathing in the Ganges. He then became an overseer on an indigo plantation; the 1857 rebellion occurred, and he was forced to flee to the Agra fortress. While standing guard one night, he was overpowered by Sikh troopers, who gave him a choice; be killed, or help them waylay Achmet, a disguised servant of an outlawed rajah, who had sent Achmet with a box of jewellery to the British for safekeeping. The robbery and murder took place, but the crime was discovered, although the hidden jewels were not. Small and his accomplices got penal servitude on the Andaman Islands.

Some years later, Small learned that Major Sholto and Captain Morstan, who were guards at the convict barracks, had lost money playing cards. Small saw his chance, and made a deal with the officers; Sholto would recover the treasure, and in return send a boat to pick up Morstan, Small, and the Sikhs so they could all meet and divide it. However, Sholto stole the treasure for himself, returning to England after inheriting a fortune from his uncle. Morstan went after Sholto but never returned, and Small vowed vengeance against Sholto. Four years later, Small escaped prison with the help of Tonga, an islander whose life he had once saved. It was the news of this escape that shocked Sholto into his fatal illness. Small arrived too late to hear of the treasure&#x27;s location, but left the note in the room anyway as revenge for the treatment of himself and the Sikhs. When Bartholomew eventually found the treasure, Small only planned to steal it; however, a miscommunication led Tonga to kill Bartholomew before Small could stop him. Small decides the treasure brings nothing but bad luck to anyone who has it; to Achmet and Bartholomew, death; to Major Sholto, fear and guilt; and for Small himself, penal servitude for life. 

Mary is left with no treasure, save the pearls; however, she and Watson have fallen in love over the course of the adventure, and the loss of the treasure has removed any barriers there might have been between them. Watson reveals that he has proposed to Mary and that she has accepted, much to the annoyance of Holmes.

==Publication history ==

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle described how he was commissioned to write the story over a dinner with Joseph Marshall Stoddart, managing editor of the American publication &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot;, at the Langham Hotel in London on 30 August 1889. Stoddart wanted to produce an English version of &quot;Lippincott’s&quot; with a British editor and British contributors. The dinner was also attended by Oscar Wilde, who eventually contributed &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; to the July 1890 issue. Doyle discussed what he called this &quot;golden evening&quot; in his 1924 autobiography &quot;Memories and Adventures&quot;.

The novel first appeared in the February 1890 edition of &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot; as &quot;The Sign of the Four; or The Problem of the Sholtos&quot;, appearing in both London and Philadelphia. The British edition of the magazine originally sold for a shilling, and the American for 25 cents. Surviving copies are now worth several thousand dollars.

Over the following few months in the same year, the novel was then republished in several regional British journals. These re-serialisations gave the title as &quot;The Sign of Four&quot;. The novel was published in book form in October 1890 by Spencer Blackett, again using the title &quot;The Sign of Four&quot;. This edition included a frontispiece illustrated by Charles H. M. Kerr. The title of both the British and American editions of this first book edition omitted the second &quot;the&quot; of the original title.

A German edition of the book published in 1902 was illustrated by Richard Gutschmidt. An edition published by George Newnes Ltd in 1903 was illustrated by F. H. Townsend.

Different editions over the years have varied between the two forms of the title, with most editions favouring the four-word form. The actual text in the novel nearly always uses &quot;the Sign of the Four&quot; (the five-word form) to describe the symbol in the story, although the four-word form is used twice by Jonathan Small in his narrative at the end of the story.

As with the first story, &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, produced two years previously, &quot;The Sign of the Four&quot; was not particularly successful to start with. It was the short stories, published from 1891 onwards in &quot;Strand Magazine&quot;, that made household names of Sherlock Holmes and his creator.

==Adaptations==
===Television and film===
There have been multiple film and television adaptations of the book:

===Radio and audio dramas===

A radio adaptation of the story was broadcast on New York radio station WGY on 9 November 1922. The cast included Edward H. Smith as Sherlock Holmes, F. H. Oliver as Dr. Watson, and Viola Karwowska as Mary Morstan. It was produced as part of a series of adaptations of plays, so it is likely that the script was based on an existing stage adaptation of the story (one was written by John Arthur Fraser in 1901 and another by Charles P. Rice in 1903).

A six-part adaptation of the novel aired in the radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. Adapted by Edith Meiser, the episodes aired from 9 November 1932 to 14 December 1932, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.

The book was adapted by Felix Felton for the BBC Light Programme in 1959. Richard Hurndall played Holmes and Bryan Coleman played Watson.

On Saturday 2 March 1963, the story was dramatised by Michael Hardwick for the BBC Home Service as part of the 1952–1969 radio series, as a ninety-minute episode on &quot;Saturday-Night Theatre&quot;, with Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson.

&quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot; aired a radio version of the story in 1977, starring Kevin McCarthy as Holmes and Court Benson as Watson.

&quot;The Sign of the Four&quot; was adapted for radio by Bert Coules in 1989 as part of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s complete Sherlock Holmes 1989–1998 radio series, with Clive Merrison as Holmes, Michael Williams as Watson, and featuring Brian Blessed as Jonathan Small.

In 2016, the story was adapted as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

In 2024, the podcast Sherlock&amp;Co adapted the story in a ten-episodes adventure called &quot;The Sign of Four&quot;, starring Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

===Stage===
Paul Giovanni&#x27;s 1978 play &quot;The Crucifer of Blood&quot; is based on the novel. The Broadway premiere featured Paxton Whitehead as Holmes and Timothy Landfield as Watson. The 1979 London production featured Keith Michell as Holmes and Denis Lill as Watson.

<doc id="415928" wikidata="Q748176" url="?curid=415928" title="Copenhagen criteria">
<text>The Copenhagen criteria are the rules that define whether a country is eligible to join the European Union. The criteria require that a state has the institutions to preserve democratic governance and human rights, has a functioning market economy, and accepts the obligations and intent of the European Union.

These membership criteria were laid down at the June 1993 European Council in Copenhagen, Denmark, from which they take their name. Excerpt from the Copenhagen Presidency conclusions:

Most of these elements have been clarified over the last decade by legislation and other decisions of the European Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament, as well as by the case law of the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights. However, there are sometimes conflicting interpretations in current member states, especially regarding what is meant by &quot;the rule of law&quot;.

==European Union membership criteria==
During the negotiations with each candidate country, progress towards meeting the Copenhagen criteria is regularly monitored. On the basis of this, decisions are made as to whether and when a particular country should join, or what actions need to be taken before joining is possible.

The &quot;European Union Membership criteria&quot; are defined by the three documents:
* The 1992 Treaty of Maastricht (Article 49)
* The declaration of the June 1993 European Council in Copenhagen, i.e., Copenhagen criteria—describing the general policy in more details
** political
** economic
** legislative
* Framework for negotiations with a particular candidate state
** specific and detailed conditions
** statement stressing that the new member cannot take its place in the Union until it is considered that the EU itself has enough &quot;absorption capacity&quot; for this to happen.

When agreed in 1993, there was no mechanism for ensuring that any country which was already an EU member state was in compliance with these criteria. However, arrangements have now been put in place to police compliance with these criteria, following the &quot;sanctions&quot; imposed against the Austrian government of Wolfgang Schüssel in early 2000 by the other 14 Member States&#x27; governments. These arrangements came into effect on 1 February 2003 under the provisions of the Treaty of Nice.

==Geographic criteria==
Article 49 (formerly Article O) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) or Maastricht Treaty states that any European country that respects the principles of the EU may apply to join. Countries&#x27; classification as European is &quot;subject to political assessment&quot; by the Commission and, more importantly, the European Council.

In 1987, Morocco applied to join the European Communities (the precursor to the European Union). The application was rejected on the grounds that Morocco was not considered to be a &quot;European country&quot; and hence could not join. The EU has generally taken a broad view of what counts as a European country, having approved the application of Cyprus and has ruled that Armenia, Georgia, and Turkey satisfy the requirements for application.

Although non-European states are not considered eligible to be members, they may enjoy varying degrees of integration with the EU, set out by international agreements. This currently includes the European Neighbourhood Policy, Union for the Mediterranean, and a variety of other European Union Association Agreements and EU free trade agreements. Non-EU European states are also participating (with or without the goal of eventual EU membership) in the Stabilisation and Association Process, Eastern Partnership, European Free Trade Association, EU-Russia Common Spaces, and Northern Dimension.

==Political criteria==

=== Democracy===
Functional democratic governance requires that all citizens of the country should be able to participate, on an equal basis, in the political decision making at every single governing level, from local municipalities up to the highest, national, level. This also requires free elections with a secret ballot, the right to establish political parties without any hindrance from the state, fair and equal access to a free press, free trade union organisations, freedom of personal opinion, and executive powers restricted by laws and allowing free access to judges independent of the executive.

=== Rule of law ===
The rule of law implies that government authority may only be exercised in accordance with documented laws, which were adopted through an established procedure. The principle is intended to be a safeguard against arbitrary rulings in individual cases.

===Human rights===
Human rights are those rights which every person holds because of their quality as a human being; human rights are inalienable and belonging to all humans. If a right is inalienable, that means it cannot be bestowed, granted, limited, bartered away, or sold away (e.g. one cannot sell oneself into slavery). These include the right to life, the right to be prosecuted only according to the laws that are in existence at the time of the offence, the right to be free from slavery, and the right to be free from torture.

The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights is considered the most authoritative formulation of human rights, although it lacks the more effective enforcement mechanism of the European Convention on Human Rights. The requirement to fall in line with this formulation forced several nations that recently joined the EU to implement major changes in their legislation, public services and judiciary. Many of the changes involved the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities, or removal of disparities of treatment between different political factions.

=== Respect for and protection of minorities ===
Members of such national minorities should be able to maintain their distinctive culture and practices, including their language (as far as not contrary to the human rights of other people, nor to democratic procedures and rule of law), without suffering any discrimination. A Council of Europe convention, the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (treaty No. 157) reflected this principle. But the Convention did not include a clear definition of what constituted a national minority. As a result, some signatory states added official declarations on the matter:

*Austria: &quot;The Republic of Austria declares that, for itself, the term &#x27;national minorities&#x27; within the meaning of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities is understood to designate those groups which come within the scope of application of the Law on Ethnic Groups (Volksgruppengesetz, Federal Law Gazette No. 396/1976) and which live and traditionally have had their home in parts of the territory of the Republic of Austria and which are composed of Austrian citizens with non-German mother tongues and with their own ethnic cultures.&quot;
*Azerbaijan: &quot;The Republic of Azerbaijan, confirming its adherence to the universal values and respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, declares that the ratification of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and implementation of its provisions do not imply any right to engage in any activity violating the territorial integrity and sovereignty, or internal and international security of the Republic of Azerbaijan.&quot; 
*Belgium: &quot;The Kingdom of Belgium declares that the Framework Convention applies without prejudice to the constitutional provisions, guarantees or principles, and without prejudice to the legislative rules which currently govern the use of languages. The Kingdom of Belgium declares that the notion of national minority will be defined by the inter-ministerial conference of foreign policy.&quot;
*Bulgaria: &quot;Confirming its adherence to the values of the Council of Europe and the desire for the integration of Bulgaria into the European structures, committed to the policy of protection of human rights and tolerance to persons belonging to minorities, and their full integration into Bulgarian society, the National Assembly of the Republic of Bulgaria declares that the ratification and implementation of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities do not imply any right to engage in any activity violating the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the unitary Bulgarian State, its internal and international security.&quot; 
*Denmark: &quot;In connection with the deposit of the instrument of ratification by Denmark of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, it is hereby declared that the Framework Convention shall apply to the German minority in South Jutland of the Kingdom of Denmark.&quot;
*Estonia: &quot;The Republic of Estonia understands the term national minorities, which is not defined in the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, as follows: are considered as national minority those citizens of Estonia who – reside on the territory of Estonia; – maintain longstanding, firm and lasting ties with Estonia; – are distinct from Estonians on the basis of their ethnic, cultural, religious or linguistic characteristics; – are motivated by a concern to preserve together their cultural traditions, their religion or their language, which constitute the basis of their common identity.&quot;
*Germany: &quot;The Framework Convention contains no definition of the notion of national minorities. It is therefore up to the individual Contracting Parties to determine the groups to which it shall apply after ratification. National Minorities in the Federal Republic of Germany are the Danes of German citizenship and the members of the Sorbian people with German citizenship. The Framework Convention will also be applied to members of the ethnic groups traditionally resident in Germany, the Frisians of German citizenship and the Sinti and Roma of German citizenship.&quot;
*Latvia: &quot;The Republic of Latvia – Recognizing the diversity of cultures, religions and languages in Europe, which constitutes one of the features of the common European identity and a particular value, – Taking into account the experience of the Council of Europe member States and the wish to foster the preservation and development of national minority cultures and languages, while respecting the sovereignty and national-cultural identity of every State, – Affirming the positive role of an integrated society, including the command of the State language, to the life of a democratic State, – Taking into account the specific historical experience and traditions of Latvia, declares that the notion &#x27;national minorities&#x27; which has not been defined in the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, shall, in the meaning of the Framework Convention, apply to citizens of Latvia who differ from Latvians in terms of their culture, religion or language, who have traditionally lived in Latvia for generations and consider themselves to belong to the State and society of Latvia, who wish to preserve and develop their culture, religion or language. Persons who are not citizens of Latvia or another State but who permanently and legally reside in the Republic of Latvia, who do not belong to a national minority within the meaning of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities as defined in this declaration, but who identify themselves with a national minority that meets the definition contained in this declaration, shall enjoy the rights prescribed in the Framework Convention, unless specific exceptions are prescribed by law. The Republic of Latvia declares that it will apply the provisions of Article 10, paragraph 2, of the Framework Convention without prejudice to the Satversme (Constitution) of the Republic of Latvia and the legislative acts governing the use of the State language that are currently into force. The Republic of Latvia declares that it will apply the provisions of Article 11, paragraph 3, of the Framework Convention without prejudice to the Satversme (Constitution) of the Republic of Latvia and the legislative acts governing the use of the State language that are currently into force.&quot;
*Liechtenstein: &quot;The Principality of Liechtenstein declares that Articles 24 and 25, in particular, of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities of 1 February 1995 are to be understood having regard to the fact that no national minorities in the sense of the Framework Convention exist in the territory of the Principality of Liechtenstein. The Principality of Liechtenstein considers its ratification of the Framework Convention as an act of solidarity in the view of the objectives of the Convention.&quot;
*Luxembourg: &quot;The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg understands by &#x27;national minority&#x27; in the meaning of the Framework Convention, a group of people settled for numerous generations on its territory, having the Luxembourg nationality and having kept distinctive characteristics in an ethnic and linguistic way. On the basis of this definition, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is induced to establish that there is no &#x27;national minority&#x27; on its territory.&quot;
*Malta: &quot;The Government of Malta reserves the right not to be bound by the provisions of Article 15 insofar as these entail the right to vote or to stand for election either for the House of Representatives or for Local Councils. The Government of Malta declares that Articles 24 and 25, in particular, of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities of 1 February 1995 are to be understood having regard to the fact that no national minorities in the sense of the Framework Convention exist in the territory of the Government of Malta. The Government of Malta considers its ratification of the Framework Convention as an act of solidarity in the view of the objectives of the Convention.&quot;
*Netherlands: &quot;The Kingdom of the Netherlands will apply the Framework Convention to the Frisians. The Government of the Netherlands assumes that the protection afforded by Article 10, paragraph 3, does not differ, despite the variations in wording, from that afforded by Article 5, paragraph 2, and Article 6, paragraph 3 (a) and (e), of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The Kingdom of the Netherlands accepts the Framework Convention for the Kingdom in Europe.&quot;
*North Macedonia: &quot;Referring to the Framework Convention, and taking into account the latest amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of North Macedonia, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Macedonia submits the revised declaration to replace the previous two declarations on the aforesaid Convention: The term &#x27;national minorities&#x27; used in the Framework Convention and the provisions of the same Convention shall be applied to the citizens of the Republic of North Macedonia who live within its borders and who are part of the Albanian people, Turkish people, Vlach people, Serbian people, Roma people and Bosniak people.&quot;
*Poland: &quot;Taking into consideration the fact, that the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities contains no definition of the national minorities notion, the Republic of Poland declares, that it understands this term as national minorities residing within the territory of the Republic of Poland at the same time whose members are Polish citizens. The Republic of Poland shall also implement the Framework Convention under Article 18 of the Convention by conclusion of international agreements mentioned in this Article, the aim of which is to protect national minorities in Poland and minorities or groups of Poles in other States.&quot;
*Russia: &quot;The Russian Federation considers that none is entitled to include unilaterally in reservations or declarations, made while signing or ratifying the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, a definition of the term &#x27;national minority&#x27;, which is not contained in the Framework Convention.&quot; 
*Slovenia: &quot;Considering that the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities does not contain a definition of the notion of national minorities and it is therefore up to the individual Contracting Party to determine the groups which it shall consider as national minorities, the Government of the Republic of Slovenia, in accordance with the Constitution and internal legislation of the Republic of Slovenia, declares that these are the autochthonous Italian and Hungarian National Minorities. In accordance with the Constitution and internal legislation of the Republic of Slovenia, the provisions of the Framework Convention shall apply also to the members of the Roma community, who live in the Republic of Slovenia.&quot;
*Sweden: &quot;The national minorities in Sweden are Sami, Sweden Finns, Tornedalers, Roma and Jews.&quot;
*Switzerland: &quot;Switzerland declares that in Switzerland national minorities in the sense of the framework Convention are groups of individuals numerically inferior to the rest of the population of the country or of a canton, whose members are Swiss nationals, have long-standing, firm and lasting ties with Switzerland and are guided by the will to safeguard together what constitutes their common identity, in particular their culture, their traditions, their religion or their language. Switzerland declares that the provisions of the framework Convention governing the use of the language in relations between individuals and administrative authorities are applicable without prejudice to the principles observed by the Confederation and the cantons in the determination of official languages.&quot;

A consensus was reached (among other legal experts, the so-called groups of Venice) that this convention refers to any ethnic, linguistic or religious people that defines itself as a distinctive group, that forms the historic population or a significant historic and current minority in a well-defined area, and that maintains stable and friendly relations with the state in which it lives. Some experts and countries wanted to go further. Nevertheless, recent minorities, such as immigrant populations, have nowhere been listed by signatory countries as minorities concerned by this convention.

== Economic criteria==
The economic criteria, broadly speaking, require that candidate countries have a functioning market economy and that their producers have the capability to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. The Euro convergence criteria and
European Exchange Rate Mechanism have been used to prepare countries for joining the Eurozone, both founding and later members.

== Legislative alignment==
Finally, and technically outside the Copenhagen criteria, comes the further requirement that all prospective members must enact legislation to bring their laws into line with the body of European law built up over the history of the Union, known as the &quot;acquis communautaire&quot;. In preparing for each admission, the acquis is divided into separate chapters, each dealing with different policy areas. For the process of the fifth enlargement that concluded with the admission of Bulgaria and Romania in 2007, there were 31 chapters. For the talks with Croatia, Turkey and Iceland the acquis has been split further into 35 chapters.

<text>The Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils (CCLRC) was a UK government body that carried out civil research in science and engineering.

On 1 April 2007 CCLRC merged with PPARC to form the Science and Technology Facilities Council.

== Activities ==
The CCLRC was created on 1 April 1995 as a non-departmental public body from the laboratories of the previous Science and Engineering Research Council including 1942 staff and an annual turnover of £106 million which had temporarily been controlled by the EPSRC. It operated at three locations:

*Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, near Didcot in Oxfordshire, incorporating the ISIS neutron source
*Daresbury Laboratory. at Daresbury in Cheshire
*Chilbolton Observatory, near Stockbridge in Hampshire

The Diamond Light Source, was developed by the CCLRC at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and established as an independent company.

The CCLRC was established:

a) to promote high quality scientific and engineering research by providing facilities and technical expertise in support of basic, strategic and applied research programmes;

b) to support the advancement of knowledge and technology, thereby contributing to the economic competitiveness of Our United Kingdom and the quality of life;

c) to provide advice, disseminate knowledge, and promote public understanding in the fields of science, engineering and technology.

Which in practice meant that it administered the UK&#x27;s large scale facilities for materials and biomolecular research, laser and space science and alternative energy exploration on behalf of the government, the other UK research funding bodies, universities, and corporate research and development.

Over eighty per cent of the funding for the programmes carried out by the CCLRC came through partnership with other UK Research Councils, whilst the remaining twenty per cent came through partnership with industrial and overseas organisations. Some 10,000 researchers are estimated to have used CLRC&#x27;s facilities and services each year - usually working in close collaboration with CLRC&#x27;s support scientists and engineers to get the best from the facilities and expertise available.

As well as operating as a single entity, the Council (CCLRC) also operated its own wholly owned trading
subsidiary, Central Laboratory Innovation and Knowledge Transfer Limited (CLIK).

By 2006 annual expenditure had nearly doubled since CCLRC&#x27;s foundation to £199.8 million as the Council&#x27;s international role expanded to include the payment of the UK&#x27;s subscriptions to facilities at the ILL and ESRF.

On 1 April 2007 CCLRC merged with PPARC to form the Science and Technology Facilities Council so that a single organisation was responsible for providing UK scientists with access to large scientific facilities in the UK and elsewhere in the world, including CERN, ESA and ESO.

== Branding ==
Given the wide breadth of its mission there was plenty of room for the CCLRC staff to promote different activities of the Council. Consequently its branding was always a problem.

Between 1994 and 1995 while the laboratories were temporarily operated by the EPSRC, the abbreviation &quot;DRAL&quot; was used to brand them as distinct from the funding Council. When the CCLRC was first established in 1995 the Director General of Research Councils did not want it to be confused with the funding Councils, so he did not want the abbreviation to include the letters &quot;RC&quot; at the end, but to be simply &quot;CCL&quot; - Council of the Central Laboratories. This only lasted for a few months when the accepted abbreviation became &quot;CLRC&quot; - Central Laboratory of the Research Councils. Since the full name included an extra word a confusion was created as to why the abbreviation appeared to be that of a different name than the actual one. To end this confusion, in 2002 the abbreviation was changed to the complete acronym of &quot;CCLRC&quot;.

== Chief Executives ==

* 1995–1998 Dr Paul Williams
* 1998–2000 Dr Albert R C Westwood 
* 2000–2001 Dr T G Walker OBE
* 2001–2007 Prof John Wood

<doc id="415933" wikidata="Q7209979" url="?curid=415933" title="Polish Roman Catholic Union of America">
<text>The Polish Roman Catholic Union of America (PRCUA) (in Polish: &quot;Zjednoczenie Polskie Rzymsko-Katolickie w Ameryce&quot;) is the oldest Polish American organization in the United States. Currently licensed to sell its products in 27 states, it is a fraternal benefit society providing financial security to its members through competitive life insurance and annuities, and offering opportunities for cultural, educational and spiritual growth.

==History==
The Polish Roman Catholic Union of America traces its existence to 1873. In June of that year, Father Theodor Gieryk of Detroit wrote letters to Polish-language newspapers urging the creation of a Polish-American national organization. On October 3, 1873, a group of influential Polish Americans met and established the PRCUA. Among these founders were Father Vincent Barzynski, an influential pastor of Saint Stanislaus Kostka in Chicago and Father Leopold Moczygemba, founder of America&#x27;s first Polish settlement in Panna Maria, Texas. The new organization&#x27;s stated goals were:

* to build Polish churches and schools
* to promote adherence to the Roman Catholic religion, and the religious and cultural traditions of the Polish nation
* to give fraternal assistance to Poles
* to take care of widows and orphans
* to help Poland to become an independent country again
* to establish the newspaper &quot;Pielgrzym&quot; as the official organ of the organization

From the time when many Polish Americans were disenchanted with the American Catholic hierarchy&#x27;s preponderance of Irish and German bishops, the PRCUA&#x27;s history spans notable periods in the development of the Polish American ethnic group, from the time of early settlement by immigrants from Poland (Poles) through their development of ethnic identity, to their dual struggles in support of Poland&#x27;s independence and to find their place in American society.

==Contention with the Polish National Alliance==
Before the First World War, the PRCUA often found itself at odds with the Polish National Alliance, a fraternal organization founded in 1880. The basic outward differences between the two fraternals are often noted. The PRCUA, earlier and more conservative, tended to support the American Catholic hierarchy overlay groups such as parish councils. The younger PNA was more radical in outlook and generally championed lay leadership over the Church hierarchy. However, a more important difference was that of their worldviews.

The PRCUA viewed the Polish American community in terms of &quot;okolica&quot;, or &quot;local environment,&quot; which it viewed as the starting point for building cultural awareness. The PNA viewed the Polish American community in terms of &quot;naród&quot;, which was constituted by the entire Polish people, at home and abroad, and took as its ultimate goal the reconstitution of divided Poland. The two fraternals were able to reconcile their differences during the 20th century and have coexisted amicably for decades.

==Newspaper and current activities==
In 1886 the &quot;Pielgrzym&quot; was replaced by the weekly &quot;Gazeta Katolicka&quot; and in 1897 by the &quot;Naród Polski&quot;. The &quot;Naród Polski&quot; became a semi-monthly publication in 1946. The &quot;Naród Polski&quot; is the official publication of the PRCUA. Today, the &quot;Naród Polski&quot; is published monthly and contains both Polish and English articles in each issue. An online version is also available to subscribers.

At present, PRCUA has developed into a fraternal benefit society that performs religious, charitable, educational and civic work on behalf of its members and the Polish-American Community. Members join PRCUA primarily by purchasing life insurance and/or annuity certificates from the organization. Members participate in activities such as folk dancing and singing, language classes, crafts, and youth festivals through local lodges. PRCUA also extends residential mortgage loans to its members.

In addition, PRCUA is the principal patron of the Polish Museum of America, the largest ethnic museum in America located in Chicago, Illinois. The PRCUA&#x27;s Home Office is located in Chicago, IL. This historic 1913 building (listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013) houses The Polish Museum of America (established in 1935) and its Library (which celebrated its 100th anniversary on April 18, 2015).

==Administration (2018–2022)== 
The organization&#x27;s current Officers are:

* James J. Robaczewski, ALMI, FIC – National President
* Micheline I. Jaminski – National Vice President
* Agnieszka J. Bastrzyk, ALMI, FICF – National Secretary-Treasurer

<doc id="415936" wikidata="Q3346716" url="?curid=415936" title="Nyree Dawn Porter">
<text>Nyree Dawn Porter OBE (born Ngaire Dawn Porter; 22 January 1936 – 10 April 2001) was a New Zealand–British actress. She started performing on stage in New Zealand, moving to the UK in 1958. She is best known for her role as Irene in the BBC series &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; (1967).

==Early life and education==
Ngaire Dawn Porter was born in Napier, New Zealand, on 22 January 1936.

She changed her name after moving to England in 1958, so that English people could pronounce it. 

==Career==
===Stage===
Porter&#x27;s first professional work was touring with the New Zealand Players Trust. She was acclaimed for such roles as Jessica in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; and Juliet in &quot;Romanoff and Juliet&quot;. She also performed in revues and musicals, including a local Napier production of &quot;The Desert Song&quot; in 1955.

She moved to Britain in 1958 after winning a Miss Cinema talent competition for young actresses organised by Rank, with the prize of a round-the-world trip and a film test in London. Although the test was probably little more than a publicity stunt, she decided to stay and was soon acting in the theatre. &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Here&quot; at the Fortune Theatre in Drury Lane was her first West End appearance. She followed this with the role of Connie in Neil Simon&#x27;s first West End play, &quot;Come Blow Your Horn&quot;, and a string of other appearances.

She had two roles in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot;, at the National Theatre in 1990, played Olivia in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; at the Shaw Theatre, and Rosalind in &quot;As You Like It&quot; at the Ludlow Festival. She later toured in Australia, in Jeffrey Archer&#x27;s &quot;Beyond Reasonable Doubt&quot;, and later in &quot;The King and I&quot;.

===Television and films===
She appeared in several television productions, including an early episode of &quot;The Avengers&quot; (&quot;Death on The Slipway&quot;, 1961); and the title role in the BBC&#x27;s 1964 adaptation of &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;.

Porter is probably best remembered for her role as Irene in the hit BBC series &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;. The 1967 series, which attracted audiences of 18 million, saw her described by critics as &quot;the first romantic sex symbol of the telly age.&quot; She herself said, &quot;I was an unknown theatre actress and Irene gave me international fame and opened doors for me&quot;.

Although subsequently finding similar high-profile roles harder to come by, she starred in the 1968 comedy series &quot;Never a Cross Word&quot; and four years later opposite Robert Vaughn in Gerry Anderson&#x27;s live-action series &quot;The Protectors&quot;. Porter also played the title role in the 26-part daytime serial &quot;For Maddie with Love&quot;, as a woman with only a few months left to live. Her husband was played by Ian Hendry. The programme ran for two series, in 1980 and 1981.

Her film appearances included &quot;Live Now, Pay Later&quot; (1962), &quot;The Cracksman&quot; (1963), &quot;Two Left Feet&quot; (1963), and two horror anthologies: &quot;The House That Dripped Blood&quot; (1971) and &quot;From Beyond the Grave&quot; (1974). She also appeared in &quot;Hilary and Jackie&quot; (1998) as the ballerina Dame Margot Fonteyn.

==Awards and honours==
In the 1970 Birthday Honours, Porter was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to television.

In 1975, she won the Spanish TP de Oro &#x27;Best Foreign Actress&#x27; award for &quot;The Protectors&quot;.

==Personal life==
Her first husband, Byron O&#x27;Leary, died in 1970 of an accidental drug overdose. In 1975 she married actor Robin Halstead after the birth of their daughter, Natalya Francesca Halstead. The couple divorced in 1987.

==Death==
She died in Wandsworth, London, in 2001 from leukaemia, aged 65. She was cremated at Putney Vale Crematorium and her ashes buried in the cemetery there.

<doc id="415945" wikidata="Q12063582" url="?curid=415945" title="Native Sons of the Golden West">
<text>The Native Sons of the Golden West (NSGW) is a fraternal service organization founded in the U.S. state of California in 1875, dedicated to historic preservation and documentation of the state&#x27;s historic structures and places, the placement of historic plaques, and other charitable functions in California. In 1890 the organization placed California&#x27;s first marker honoring the discovery of gold, which gave rise to the state nickname, &quot;The Golden State&quot;. U.S. President Richard M. Nixon and Chief Justice Earl Warren served terms as presidents of the NSGW.

==History==
The Native Sons of the Golden West was founded 11 July 1875 by General A. M. Winn, a Virginian, as a lasting monument to the men and women of the Gold Rush era. General Winn had lived in California during the Gold Rush and was impressed with the spirit and perseverance of the Forty-Niners. Speaking of his object in organizing the Order General Winn said, &quot;For twenty years my mind had been running on some lasting style of monument to mark and perpetuate the discovery of gold. I could not think of anything that would not perish in course of time. At last it came to my mind that an Order composed of native sons would effect the object and be sustained by pride of parentage and place of nativity while it would be an imperishable memento an institution that would last through all time.&quot;

The chief objects of the Order as set forth in its constitution were, &quot;To perpetuate in the minds of all native Californians the memories of the days of &#x27;49 to encourage a lively interest in all matters and measures relating to the promotion of the national interests and to the upbuilding [sic] of the State of California.&quot; Today, the Native Sons of the Golden West is open to membership from any native-born, current or former resident of California origin. The Native Sons of the Golden West is a charitable and fraternal organization. Organized locally into &quot;Parlors,&quot; the group is perhaps best known for the large number of commemorative markers it has placed throughout the state.

The society has a sister organization, the Native Daughters of the Golden West. 

The Native Sons began as an organization &quot;embracing only the sons of those sturdy pioneers who arrived on this coast prior to the admission of California as a state.&quot; In the 1920s, the Native Sons took two very different stances; one on immigration and one on rights for Native Americans. In April 1920, then-Grand President William P. Caubu of the Native Sons wrote that “California was given by God to a white people, and with God’s strength we want to keep it as He gave it to us.&quot; The Native Sons openly opposed Chinese, Mexican, and Japanese immigration and waged an unsuccessful legal battle for Japanese-Americans to be disenfranchised during World War II. However, by contrast, the Native Sons actively fought for California Native American rights. &quot;The Commonwealth Club of San Francisco was looking into the matter of Indian rights under the 18 treaties as early as 1909. This resulted in a special section on Indian Affairs for the purpose of making a complete study of the rights, wrongs, and present condition of California Indians in 1924. The Native Sons was one of the groups that was active in this area. Study committees were formed and publicity as to the needs of the California Indians appeared in its magazine, the California Grizzly Bear. In 1922 and again in 1925, there were articles of real importance in arousing public opinion. In Nevada City, Native Sons Hydraulic Parlor No. 58 &quot;aided the American Indians and succeeded in having the land set aside for native inhabitants. In April 1913, Indian agent C. H. Ashbury came from Reno to determine if the Indian land claims was valid and to conduct the proceedings, calling neighbors, city trustees, and member of the Native Sons and Daughters to testify...&quot;

From the organization&#x27;s founding until 2024, birth within California was one of the eligibility requirements for membership in the Native Sons. In summer 2024, as membership numbers became unsustainable, delegates at the annual meeting voted to accept as members &quot;every United States citizen 18 and older who lives in California, regardless of place of birth&quot;.

==Historical preservation==
Throughout its history, members of the Native Sons have safeguarded many of the landmarks of California&#x27;s pioneer days, purchasing and rehabilitating them and then donating them to the State or local governments.

* Sutter&#x27;s Fort, Sacramento: By 1888 the once proud fort built by John Sutter was abandoned and deteriorating and the City of Sacramento sought to demolish it. C. E. Grunsky of Native Sons of the Golden West Sunset Parlor #26 in Sacramento led the fight to purchase and restore this most important symbol of California&#x27;s pioneer history. After two years of fundraising, the Native Sons bought the historic Central Building and turned the land and building over to the State of California for further restoration.
* San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park, San Francisco: The &quot;Grace Quan&quot; is a reproduction of a 19th-century Chinese shrimp fishing junk. The replica was built in 2003 by the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park and all of the wood for construction was donated by Native Sons, Redwood Parlor #66.
* Rancho Petaluma Adobe, Petaluma: In 1910, Native Sons of the Golden West, Petaluma Parlor #27 purchased what remained of General Mariano G. Vallejo&#x27;s vast adobe ranch house. Over half of the building had succumbed to neglect and the forces of nature. In 1932 it was registered as California State Historical Landmark #18. After years of work and fundraising, the fully restored historic site was turned over to the State of California in 1951.
* San Pasqual Battlefield State Historic Park, Escondido: San Pasqual Battlefield State Historic Park honors the soldiers who fought in the 1846 Battle of San Pasqual, the bloodiest battle in California during the Mexican–American War. The Native Sons of the Golden West were instrumental in raising money, preserving and ultimately creating the park which was then given to the State of California.
* James W. Marshall Monument Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park, Coloma: In 1886, the members of the Native Sons of the Golden West, Placerville Parlor #9 felt that the &quot;Discoverer of Gold&quot; deserved a monument to mark his final resting place. In May 1890, five years after Marshall&#x27;s death, Placerville Parlor #9 of the Native Sons of the Golden West successfully advocated the idea of a monument to the State Legislature, which appropriated a total of $9,000 for the construction of the monument and tomb, the first such monument erected in California. A statue of Marshall stands on top of the monument, pointing to the spot where he made his discovery in 1848. The monument was rededicated October 8, 2010 by the Native Sons of the Golden West, Georgetown Parlor #91 in honor of the 200th anniversary of James W. Marshall&#x27;s birth.
* Pioneer Monument Donner Memorial State Park, Truckee: The Pioneer Monument was erected in honor of all who made the difficult trek across the western plains and mountains to reach California during the 1840s. Constructed near the site of the cabins that gave shelter to the Donner Party, work on the monument began in 1901. On June 6, 1918 in a ceremony that included Donner Party survivors, the Native Sons of the Golden West donated the completed monument and eleven (11) surrounding acres to the State of California.
* Old Customhouse (Monterey, California): The Monterey Customs House, over which the American flag was first permanently raised in California, was a landmark that Native Sons determined should not disappear if within the power of the Order to prevent it. The property belonged to the United States Government, but the Native Sons obtained a lease of the buildings and grounds and restored them in the early 1900s. The lease was ultimately transferred to a State Commission appointed under a legislative act passed in 1901 which act also carried an appropriation for further restoration of the building.
* Colton Hall, Monterey: Native Sons were instrumental in 1903 in securing a legislative appropriation for necessary repairs on Colton Hall. It was within this building in September 1849 that the convention convened which drafted the Constitution under California was admitted into the Union.
* Mission San Antonio de Padua, Alta: Mission San Antonio de Padua was founded on July 14, 1771, the third mission founded in Alta California by Father Presidente Junípero Serra, and site of the first Christian marriage and first use of fired-tile roofing in Upper California. The first attempt at rebuilding the Mission came in 1903, when the California Historical Landmarks League began holding outings at San Antonio. &quot;Preservation and restoration of Mission San Antonio began. The Native Sons of the Golden West supplied $1,400. Tons of debris were removed from the interior of the chapel. Breaches in the side wall were filled in.&quot;
* Bear Flag Monument, Sonoma: &quot;For many years, the site in Sonoma Plaza where the bear flag originally had been raised went unmarked. Largely through the efforts of the Native Sons, the legislature appropriated $5,000 for a monument to be placed there. The Native Sons raised $500 to prepare the site, put on dedication ceremonies, and to move the huge rock that serves as the pedestal from a mile away.&quot; The piece is listed as a California Historical Landmark.
* Bale Grist Mill founded by Edward Turner Bale in 1846 was preserved and restored through efforts of Native Sons.

==Historical markers==
Chapters of the organization (called &quot;Parlors&quot;) place historical markers on buildings and on sites of historical interest. The organization maintains a list of the over 1,200 markers in place. One of these plaques is featured in the movie &quot;&#x27;The Karate Kid&quot; on the side of Daniel LaRusso&#x27;s new school in California.

<text>USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; (AGER-2) is a , placed into service during World War II, then converted to a spy ship in 1967 by the United States Navy. She gathered intelligence and oceanographic information, monitoring electronic and radio signals from North Korea. On 23 January 1968, the ship was attacked and captured by a North Korean vessel, in what became known as the &quot;&quot;Pueblo&quot; incident&quot;.

The seizure of the U.S. Navy ship and her 83 crew members, one of whom was killed in the attack, came less than a week after President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s State of the Union address to the United States Congress, a week before the start of the Tet Offensive in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War and three days after 31 men of North Korea&#x27;s KPA Unit 124 had crossed the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and killed 26 South Koreans and 4 Americans in an attempt to attack the South Korean Blue House (executive mansion) in the capital Seoul. The taking of &quot;Pueblo&quot; and the abuse and torture of her crew during the next eleven months became a major Cold War incident, raising tensions between western and eastern powers.

North Korea stated that &quot;Pueblo&quot; deliberately entered their territorial waters away from Ryo Island, and that the logbook shows that they intruded several times. However, the United States maintained that the vessel was in international waters at the time of the incident and that any purported evidence supplied by North Korea to support its statements was fabricated. &quot;Pueblo&quot; remains held in North Korea, officially a commissioned vessel of the United States Navy.

Since early 2013, the ship has been moored along the Pothonggang Canal in Pyongyang and is displayed there as a museum ship at the Victorious War Museum. &quot;Pueblo&quot; is the only ship of the U.S. Navy still on the commissioned roster and held captive.

==Initial operations==
The ship was launched at the Kewaunee Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in Kewaunee, Wisconsin, on 16 April 1944, as the United States Army Freight and Passenger (FP) &quot;FP-344&quot;. The Army later redesignated the FP vessels as Freight and Supply changing the designation to &quot;FS-344&quot;. The ship, commissioned at New Orleans on 7 April 1945, served as a Coast Guard–manned Army vessel used for training civilians for the Army. Her first commanding officer was Lt. J. R. Choate, USCGR, succeeded by Lt. J.G. Marvin B. Barker, USCGR, on 12 September 1945. &quot;FS-344&quot; was placed out of service in 1954.

In 1964 the Department of Defense became interested in having smaller, less expensive, more flexible and responsive signals intelligence collection vessels than the existing AGTR and T-AG vessels. The mothballed light cargo ships were the most suitable existing DOD ships, and one was converted to in 1964 and began operations in 1965. &quot;Banner&#x27;s&quot; mission was to surveil high-frequency electronic emissions with line-of-sight propagation requiring operating closer to shore than previous intelligence gathering missions. &quot;Banner&quot; was unarmed, but the crew were issued five M1911 pistols and three M1 Garand rifles. &quot;Banner&quot; was confronted by Soviet Navy ships while operating off the Pacific coast of the Soviet Union. These ships would sometimes display international signal flags meaning: &quot;Heave to or I will fire,&quot; but &quot;Banner&quot; kept steaming with scrupulous attention to International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. Soviet recognition of possible American reciprocity against Soviet ships on similar missions discouraged attacks.

&quot;FS-344&quot; was transferred to the United States Navy on 12 April 1966 and was renamed USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; (AKL-44) after Pueblo and Pueblo County, Colorado on 18 June. Initially, she was classified as a light cargo ship for basic refitting at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard during 1966. As &quot;Pueblo&quot; was prepared under a non-secret cover as a light cargo ship, the general crew staffing and training was on this basis, with 44% having never been to sea when first assigned. Installation of signals intelligence equipment, at a cost of $1.5 million, was delayed to 1967 for budgetary reasons, resuming service as what is colloquially known as a &quot;spy ship&quot; and redesignated &quot;AGER-2&quot; on 13 May 1967. The limited budget for conversion caused disapproval of several improvements requested by the prospective commanding officer, Lloyd Bucher. Requested engine overhaul was denied despite &quot;Banner&#x27;s&quot; experience of drifting for two days unable to communicate following failure of both engines on patrol. A requested emergency scuttling system was denied, and Bucher was subsequently unable to obtain explosives for demolition charges. Replacement of burn barrels with a fuel-fed incinerator to allow speedy destruction of classified documents was denied. After Bucher&#x27;s subsequent request to reduce the ship&#x27;s library of classified publications was similarly denied, he was able to purchase a less capable incinerator using some discretionary funds intended for crew comfort. Following the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident on 8 June, Vice Chief of Naval Operations (VCNO) Horacio Rivero Jr. ordered that no Navy ship would operate without adequate means of defending itself. VCNO staff directed the shipyard to install a 3-inch/50-caliber gun on &quot;Pueblo&#x27;s&quot; main deck with provisions for ammunition storage, but Bucher successfully argued against such installation because of reduced ship stability by addition of weight above the main deck. After testing and deficiency rework &quot;Pueblo&quot; sailed from the shipyard on 11 September 1967 to San Diego for shake-down training.

When the unarmed &quot;Pueblo&quot; reached the U.S. Navy base at Yokosuka, Japan, the commander of United States Naval Forces Japan directed the ship to take two M2 Browning .50 caliber machine guns as a substitute for the missing deck gun. In the limited time available for training, ten of the ship&#x27;s crew fired five rounds each. Bucher opted to mount these guns in exposed positions on the bow and stern to keep them as far as possible from his position on the bridge. These positions eliminated possible use of the ship&#x27;s superstructure to protect the gunners and conceal the guns and ammunition service lockers. The exposed guns, with no nearby ammunition supply, were disguised under canvas covers which became rigid with frozen spray.

==&quot;Pueblo&quot; incident==

On 5 January 1968, &quot;Pueblo&quot; left Yokosuka in transit to the U.S. naval base at Sasebo, Japan; from there she left on 11 January 1968, headed northward through the Tsushima Strait into the Sea of Japan. She left with specific orders to intercept and conduct surveillance of Soviet Navy activity in the Tsushima Strait and to gather signal and electronic intelligence from North Korea. Mission planners failed to recognize that the absence of similar North Korean missions around the United States would free North Korea from the possibility of retribution in kind which had restrained Soviet response. The declassified SIGAD for the National Security Agency (NSA) Direct Support Unit (DSU) from the Naval Security Group (NSG) on &quot;Pueblo&quot; during the patrol involved in the incident was USN-467Y. AGER (Auxiliary General Environmental Research) denoted a joint Naval and National Security Agency (NSA) program. Aboard were the ship&#x27;s crew of five officers and 38 enlisted men, one officer and 37 enlisted men of the NSG, and two civilian oceanographers to provide a cover story.

On 16 January 1968, &quot;Pueblo&quot; arrived at the 42°N parallel in preparation for the patrol, which was to transit down the North Korean coast from 41°N to 39°N, and then back, without getting closer than from the North Korean coast, at night moving out to a distance of . This was challenging as only two sailors had good navigational experience, with the captain later reporting, &quot;I did not have a highly professional group of seamen to do my navigational chores for me.&quot;

At 17:30 on 20 January 1968, a North Korean modified SO-1 class Soviet style submarine chaser passed within of &quot;Pueblo&quot;, which was about southeast of Mayang-do at a position 39°47&#x27;N and 128°28.5&#x27;E.
In the afternoon of 22 January 1968, the two North Korean fishing trawlers &quot;Rice Paddy 1&quot; and &quot;Rice Paddy 2&quot; passed within of &quot;Pueblo&quot;. That day, a North Korean KPA Special Operations Force unit made an assassination attempt at the Blue House executive mansion against South Korean president Park Chung Hee, but the crew of &quot;Pueblo&quot; was not informed.

According to the American account, the following day, 23 January, &quot;Pueblo&quot; was approached by a submarine chaser and her nationality was challenged; &quot;Pueblo&quot; responded by raising the U.S. flag and directing the civilian oceanographers to commence water sampling procedures with their deck winch. The North Korean vessel then ordered &quot;Pueblo&quot; to or be fired upon. &quot;Pueblo&quot; attempted to maneuver away, but was considerably slower than the submarine chaser. Several warning shots were fired. Additionally, three torpedo boats appeared on the horizon and then joined in the chase and subsequent attack.

The attackers were soon joined by two Korean People&#x27;s Air Force MiG-21 fighters. A fourth torpedo boat and a second submarine chaser appeared on the horizon a short time later. The ammunition on &quot;Pueblo&quot; was stored below decks, and her machine guns were wrapped in cold-weather tarpaulins. The machine guns were unmanned, and no attempt was made to man them. An NSA report quotes the sailing order:

and notes:


U.S. Navy authorities and the crew of &quot;Pueblo&quot; insist that before the capture, &quot;Pueblo&quot; was miles outside North Korean territorial waters. North Korea claims that the vessel was well within North Korean territory. The &quot;Pueblo&quot;″s mission statement allowed her to approach within a nautical mile (1,852 m) of that limit. However, North Korea describes a sea boundary even though international standards were at the time.

The North Korean vessels attempted to board &quot;Pueblo&quot;, but she was maneuvered to prevent this for over two hours. The submarine chaser then opened fire with a 57 mm cannon and the smaller vessels fired machine guns, injuring Signalman Leach in his left calf and upper right side. Captain Bucher, too, received slight shrapnel wounds, but they were not incapacitating. The crew of &quot;Pueblo&quot; then began destroying sensitive material. The volume of material on board was so great that it was impossible to destroy it all. An NSA report quotes Lieutenant Steve Harris, the officer in charge of &quot;Pueblo&quot;″s Naval Security Group Command detachment:

and concludes:

Radio contact between &quot;Pueblo&quot; and the Naval Security Group in Kamiseya, Japan had been ongoing during the incident. As a result, Seventh Fleet command was fully aware of &quot;Pueblo&quot;″s situation. Air cover was promised but never arrived. The Fifth Air Force had no aircraft on strip alert, and estimated a two-to-three-hour delay in launching aircraft. was located south of &quot;Pueblo&quot;, yet her four F-4B aircraft on alert were not equipped for an air-to-surface engagement. &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s captain estimated that 1.5 hours (90 minutes) were required to get the converted aircraft into the air.

Eventually the shelling forced &quot;Pueblo&quot; to stop, signal compliance, and follow the North Korean vessels as ordered. &quot;Pueblo&quot; stopped again immediately outside North Korean waters in an attempt to obtain more time for destroying sensitive material, but was immediately fired upon by the submarine chaser, and a sailor, fireman Duane Hodges, was killed, after which &quot;Pueblo&quot; resumed following the North Korean vessels. The ship was finally boarded at 05:55 UTC (2:55 pm local) by men from a torpedo boat and the submarine chaser. Crew members had their hands tied and were blindfolded, beaten, and prodded with bayonets. Once &quot;Pueblo&quot; was in North Korean territorial waters, she was boarded again, this time by high-ranking North Korean officials.
The first official confirmation that the ship was in North Korean hands came five days later, 28 January 1968. Two days earlier, a flight by a CIA A-12 Oxcart aircraft from the Project Black Shield squadron at Kadena, Okinawa, flown by pilot Jack Weeks, made three high-altitude, high-speed flights over North Korea. When the aircraft&#x27;s films were processed in the United States, they showed &quot;Pueblo&quot; to be in the Wonsan harbor area surrounded by two North Korean vessels.

There was dissent among government officials in the United States regarding the nation&#x27;s response to the situation. Congressman Mendel Rivers suggested that President Johnson issue an ultimatum for the return of &quot;Pueblo&quot; under penalty of nuclear attack, while Senator Gale McGee said that the United States should wait for more information and not make &quot;spasmodic response[s] to aggravating incidents.&quot; According to Horace Busby, Special Assistant to President Johnson, the president&#x27;s &quot;reaction to the hostage taking was to work very hard here to keep down any demands for retaliation or any other attacks upon North Koreans&quot;, worried that rhetoric might result in the hostages being killed.

On Wednesday, 24 January 1968, the day following the incident, after extensive cabinet meetings Washington decided that its initial response should be to:

*Deploy air and naval forces to the immediate area.
*Make reconnaissance flights over the location of the &quot;Pueblo&quot;.
*Call up military reserves and extend terms of military service.
*Protest the incident within the framework of the United Nations.
*Have President Johnson personally cable Soviet premier Alexei Kosygin.

The Johnson Administration also considered a blockade of North Korean ports, air strikes on military targets and an attack across the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas.

Although American officials assumed that the seizure of &quot;Pueblo&quot; had been directed by the Soviet Union, declassified Soviet archives later showed that the Soviet leadership was caught by surprise, and became fearful of war on the Korean peninsula. Eastern Bloc ambassadors urged North Korea to exercise caution after the incident. Several documents suggest that North Korea&#x27;s aggressive action may have been an attempt to signal a tilt towards the Chinese Communist Party in the aftermath of the Sino-Soviet split in 1966.

==Aftermath==
&quot;Pueblo&quot; was taken into port at Wonsan and the crew was moved twice to prisoner-of-war (POW) camps. The crew members reported upon release that they were starved and regularly tortured while in North Korean custody. This treatment turned worse when the North Koreans realized that crewmen were secretly giving them &quot;the finger&quot; in staged propaganda photos.

Commander Lloyd M. Bucher was psychologically tortured, including being put through a mock firing squad in an effort to make him confess. Eventually the North Koreans threatened to execute his men in front of him, and Bucher relented and agreed to &quot;confess to his and the crew&#x27;s transgression.&quot; Bucher wrote the confession since a &quot;confession&quot; by definition needed to be written by the confessor himself. They verified the meaning of what he wrote, but failed to catch the pun when he said &quot;We paean the DPRK [North Korea]. We paean their great leader Kim Il Sung&quot;. (Bucher pronounced &quot;&quot;&quot; as &quot;pee on&quot;.&quot;)

Negotiations for the release of the crew took place at Panmunjom. At the same time, U.S. officials were concerned with conciliating the South Koreans, who expressed discontent about being left out of the negotiations. Richard A. Ericson, a political counselor for the American embassy in Seoul and operating officer for the &quot;Pueblo&quot; negotiations, notes in his oral history:

The South Koreans were absolutely furious and suspicious of what we might do. They anticipated that the North Koreans would try to exploit the situation to the ROK&#x27;s disadvantage in every way possible, and they were rapidly growing distrustful of us and losing faith in their great ally. Of course, we had this other problem of how to ensure that the ROK would not retaliate for the Blue House Raid and to ease their growing feelings of insecurity. They began to realize that the DMZ was porous and they wanted more equipment and aid. So, we were juggling a number of problems.

He also noted how the meetings at Panmunjom were usually unproductive because of the particular negotiating style of the North Koreans:

As one example, we would go up with a proposal of some sort on the release of the crew and they would be sitting there with a card catalog ... If the answer to the particular proposal we presented wasn&#x27;t in the cards, they would say something that was totally unresponsive and then go off and come back to the next meeting with an answer that was directed to the question. But there was rarely an immediate answer. That happened all through the negotiations. Their negotiators obviously were never empowered to act or speak on the basis of personal judgment or general instructions. They always had to defer a reply and presumably they went over it up in Pyongyang and passed it around and then decided on it. Sometimes we would get totally nonsensical responses if they didn&#x27;t have something in the card file that corresponded to the proposal at hand.

Ericson and George Newman, the Deputy Chief of Mission in Seoul, wrote a telegram for the State Department in February 1968, predicting how the negotiations would play out:

What we said in effect was this: If you are going to do this thing at Panmunjom, and if your sole objective is to get the crew back, you will be playing into North Korea&#x27;s hands and the negotiations will follow a clear and inevitable path. You are going to be asked to sign a document that the North Koreans will have drafted. They will brook no changes. It will set forth their point of view and require you to confess to everything they accuse you of ... If you allow them to, they will take as much time as they feel they need to squeeze every damn thing they can get out of this situation in terms of their propaganda goals, and they will try to exploit this situation to drive a wedge between the U.S. and the ROK. Then when they feel they have accomplished all they can, and when we have agreed to sign their document of confession and apology, they will return the crew. They will not return the ship. This is the way it is going to be because this is the way it has always been.

Following an apology, a written admission by the U.S. that &quot;Pueblo&quot; had been spying, and an assurance that the U.S. would not spy in the future, the North Korean government decided to release the 82 remaining crew members, although the written apology was preceded by an oral statement that it was done only to secure the release. On 23 December 1968, the crew was taken by buses to the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) border with South Korea and crossing at the &quot;Bridge of No Return&quot;, carrying with them the body of Fireman Duane D. Hodges, who was killed during the capture. Exactly 11 months after being taken prisoner, the captain led the long line of crewmen, followed at the end by the executive officer, Lieutenant Ed Murphy, the last man across the bridge.

Bucher and all of the officers and crew subsequently appeared before a Navy Court of Inquiry. A court-martial was recommended for Bucher and the officer in charge of the research department, Lieutenant Steve Harris, for surrendering without a fight and for failing to destroy classified material, but Secretary of the Navy John Chafee, rejected the recommendation, stating, &quot;They have suffered enough.&quot; Commander Bucher was never found guilty of any indiscretions and continued his Navy career until retirement.

In 1970, Bucher published an autobiographical account of the USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; incident entitled &quot;Bucher: My Story&quot;. Bucher died in San Diego on 28 January 2004, at the age of 76. James Kell, a former sailor under his command, suggested that the injuries that Bucher suffered during his time in North Korea contributed to his death.

Along with the Battle of Khe Sanh and the Tet Offensive, the &quot;Pueblo&quot; incident was a key factor in turning U.S. public opinion against the Vietnam War and influencing Lyndon B. Johnson into withdrawing from the 1968 presidential election.

USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; is still held by North Korea. In October 1999, she was towed from Wonsan on the east coast, around the Korean Peninsula, to the port of Nampo on the west coast. This required moving the vessel through international waters, and was undertaken just before the visit of U.S. presidential envoy James Kelly to Pyongyang. After the stop at the Nampo shipyard, &quot;Pueblo&quot; was relocated to Pyongyang and moored on the Taedong River near the spot where the &quot;General Sherman&quot; incident is believed to have taken place. In late 2012, &quot;Pueblo&quot; was moved again to the Pothonggang Canal in Pyongyang, next to a new addition to the Fatherland Liberation War Museum.

Today, &quot;Pueblo&quot; remains the second-oldest commissioned ship in the U.S. Navy, behind (&quot;Old Ironsides&quot;). &quot;Pueblo&quot; is one of only a few American ships to have been captured since the First Barbary War.

=== Breach of U.S. communications security ===
Reverse engineering of communications devices on &quot;Pueblo&quot; allowed the North Koreans to share knowledge with the Soviet Union that led to the replication of those communications devices. This allowed the two nations access to the US Navy&#x27;s communication systems until the US Navy revised those systems. The seizure of &quot;Pueblo&quot; followed soon after US Navy warrant officer John Anthony Walker introduced himself to Soviet authorities, setting up the Walker spy ring. It has been argued (by John Prados in the June 2010 issue of &quot;Naval History Magazine&quot;) that the seizure of &quot;Pueblo&quot; was executed specifically to capture the encryption devices aboard. Without them, it was difficult for the Soviets to make full use of Walker&#x27;s information. Mitchell Lerner and Jong-Dae Shin argue that Soviet-bloc Romanian dossiers demonstrate that the Soviets had no knowledge of the capture of the ship and were taken by surprise when it happened.

After debriefing the released crew, the U.S. prepared a &quot;Cryptographic Damage Assessment&quot; that was declassified in late 2006. The report concluded that, while the crew made a diligent effort to destroy sensitive material, most of them were not familiar with cryptographic equipment and publications, had not received training in their proper destruction, and that their efforts were not sufficient to prevent the North Koreans from recovering most of the sensitive material. The crew itself thought the North Koreans would be able to rebuild much of the equipment.

Cryptographic equipment on board at the time of capture included &quot;one KL-47 for off-line encryption, two KW-7s for on-line encryption, three KWR-37s for receiving the Navy Operational Intelligence Broadcast, and four KG-14s which are used in conjunction with the KW-37 for receiving the Fleet Broadcasts.&quot; Additional tactical systems and one-time pads were captured, but they were considered of little significance since most messages sent using them would be of value for only a short time.

The ship&#x27;s cryptographic personnel were subject to intense interrogation by what they felt were highly knowledgeable electronics experts. When crew members attempted to withhold details, they were later confronted with pages from captured manuals and told to correct their earlier accounts. The report concluded that the information gained from the interrogations saved the North Koreans three to six months of effort, but that they would have eventually understood everything from the captured equipment and accompanying technical manuals alone. The crew members were also asked about many U.S. cryptographic systems that were not on board the &quot;Pueblo&quot;, but only supplied superficial information.

The &quot;Pueblo&quot; carried key lists for January, February and March 1968, but immediately after the &quot;Pueblo&quot; was captured, instructions were sent to other holders of those keys not to use them, so damage was limited. However it was discovered in the debriefing that the &quot;Pueblo&quot; had onboard superseded key lists for November and December 1967 which should have been destroyed by January 15, well before the &quot;Pueblo&quot; arrived on station, according to standing orders. The report considered the capture of the superseded keys for November and December the most damaging cryptographic loss. The capture of these keys likely allowed North Korea and its allies to read more than 117,000 classified messages sent during those months. The North Koreans would also have gained a thorough knowledge of the workings of the captured systems but that would only have been of use if additional key material was compromised in the future. The existence of the Walker spy ring was, of course, not known at the time of the report.

The report noted that &quot;the North Koreans did not display any of the captured cryptographic material to the crew, except for some equipment diagrams, or otherwise publicize the material for propaganda purposes. When contrasted with the international publicity given to the capture of other highly classified Special Intelligence documents, the fact that this material was not displayed or publicized would indicate that they thoroughly understood its significance and the importance of concealing from the United States the details of the information they had acquired.&quot;

=== In the communist camp ===

Documents released from National Archives of Romania suggest it was the Chinese rather than the Soviets who actively encouraged the reopening of hostilities in Korea during 1968, promising North Korea vast material support should hostilities in Korea resume. Together with Blue House Raid, the &quot;Pueblo&quot; incident turned out to be part of an increasing divergence between the Soviet leadership and North Korea. Fostering a resumption of hostilities in Korea, allegedly, was seen in Beijing as a way to mend relations between North Korea and China, and pull North Korea back in the Chinese sphere of influence in the context of the Sino-Soviet split. After the (then secret) diplomatic efforts of the Soviets to have the American crew released fell on deaf ears in Pyongyang, Leonid Brezhnev publicly denounced North Korea&#x27;s actions at the 8th plenary session of the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In contrast, the Chinese (state controlled) press published declarations supportive of North Korea&#x27;s actions in the &quot;Pueblo&quot; incident.

Furthermore, Soviet archives reveal that the Soviet leadership was particularly displeased that North Korean leader Kim Il-sung had contradicted the assurances he previously gave Moscow that he would avoid a military escalation in Korea. Previously secret documents suggest the Soviets were surprised by the &quot;Pueblo&quot; incident, first learning of it in the press. The same documents reveal that the North Koreans also kept the Soviets completely in the dark regarding ongoing negotiations with the Americans for the crew&#x27;s release, which was another bone of contention. The Soviet reluctance at a reopening of hostilities in Korea was partly motivated by the fact that they had a 1961 treaty with North Korea that obliged them to intervene in case the latter got attacked. Brezhnev however had made it clear in 1966 that just as in the case of the similar treaty they had with China, the Soviets were prepared to ignore it rather than go to all-out war with the United States.

Given that Chinese and North Korean archives surrounding the incident remain secret, Kim Il-sung&#x27;s intentions cannot be known with certainty. The Soviets revealed however that Kim Il-sung sent a letter to Alexei Kosygin on 31 January 1968 demanding further military and economic aid, which was interpreted by the Soviets as the price they would have to pay to restrain Kim Il-sung&#x27;s bellicosity. Consequently, Kim Il-sung was invited to Moscow, but he refused to go in person owing to &quot;increased defense preparations&quot; he had to attend to, sending instead his defense minister, Kim Chang-bong, who arrived on 26 February 1968. During a long meeting with Brezhnev, the Soviet leader made it clear that they were not willing to go to war with the United States, but agreed to an increase in subsidies for North Korea, which did happen in subsequent years.

==Timeline of negotiations==
Major General Pak Chung-kuk represented North Korea (DPRK) and U.S. Navy Rear Admiral John Victor Smith represented the United States until April 1968, at which point he was replaced by U.S. Army Major General Gilbert H. Woodward. The timeline and quotations are taken from &quot;Matter of Accountability&quot; by Trevor Armbrister.
==Tourist attraction==
&quot;Pueblo&quot; is a tourist attraction in Pyongyang, North Korea, since being moved to the Taedong River. &quot;Pueblo&quot; used to be anchored at the spot where it is believed the &quot;General Sherman&quot; incident took place in 1866. In late November 2012 &quot;Pueblo&quot; was moved from the Taedong river dock to a casement on the Pothong river next to the new Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum. The ship was renovated and made open to tourists with an accompanying video of the North Korean perspective in late July 2013. To commemorate the anniversary of the Korean War, the ship had a new layer of paint added. Visitors are allowed to board the ship and see its superstructure, secret code room and crew artifacts. Sailors of the KPN, as well as officers of the KPA, lead tourists through the ship.

==Offer to repatriate==
During an August 2005 diplomatic session in North Korea, former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Donald Gregg received verbal indications from high-ranking North Korean officials that the state would be willing to repatriate &quot;Pueblo&quot; to United States authorities, on the condition that a prominent U.S. government official, such as the Secretary of State, come to Pyongyang for high level talks. While the U.S. government has publicly stated on several occasions that the return of the still-commissioned Navy vessel is a priority, there has been no indication that the matter was brought up by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on his April 2018 visit.

==Lawsuits==
Former &quot;Pueblo&quot; crew members William Thomas Massie, Dunnie Richard Tuck, Donald Raymond McClarren, and Lloyd Bucher sued the North Korean government for the abuse they suffered at its hands during their captivity. North Korea did not respond to the suit. In December 2008, U.S. District Judge Henry H. Kennedy, Jr., in Washington, D.C., awarded the plaintiffs $65 million in damages, describing their ill treatment by North Korea as &quot;extensive and shocking.&quot; The plaintiffs, as of October 2009, were attempting to collect the judgement from North Korean assets frozen by the U.S. government.

In February 2021 a U.S. court awarded the survivors and their families $2.3 billion. It is uncertain if they will be able to collect the money from North Korea.

==Awards==
&quot;Pueblo&quot; has earned the following awards:




As for the crew members, they did not receive full recognition for their involvement in the incident until decades later. In 1988, the military announced it would award Prisoner of War medals to those captured in the nation&#x27;s conflicts. While thousands of American prisoners of war were awarded medals, the crew members of &quot;Pueblo&quot; did not receive them. Instead, they were classified as &quot;detainees&quot;. It was not until Congress passed a law overturning this decision that the medals were awarded; the crew finally received the medals at San Diego in May 1990.

==Representation in popular culture==
The 1968 &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The &quot;Enterprise&quot; Incident&quot; was very loosely based upon the &quot;Pueblo&quot; incident. In the episode written by D. C. Fontana, Captain Kirk takes the Federation starship USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, apparently without authorization, into enemy Romulan space.

The &quot;Pueblo&quot; incident was dramatically depicted in the 1973 &quot;ABC Theater&quot; televised production &quot;Pueblo&quot;. Hal Holbrook starred as Captain Lloyd Bucher. The two-hour drama was nominated for three Emmy Awards, winning two.

<doc id="415951" wikidata="Q284343" url="?curid=415951" title="Irritant diaper dermatitis">
<text>Irritant diaper dermatitis (IDD, also called a diaper or nappy rash) is a generic term applied to skin rash in the diaper (in British and Australian English &quot;nappy&quot;) area that are caused by various skin disorders and/or irritants.

Generic irritant diaper dermatitis is characterized by joined patches of erythema and scaling mainly seen on the surfaces, with the skin folds spared.

Diaper dermatitis with secondary bacterial or fungal involvement tends to spread to surfaces (i.e. skin folds), as well as convex surfaces, and often exhibits a central red, beefy erythema with satellite pustules around the border.

It is usually considered a form of irritant contact dermatitis. The word &quot;diaper&quot; is in the name not because the diaper itself causes the rash but rather because the rash is associated with diaper use, being caused by the materials trapped by the diaper (usually feces). Allergic contact dermatitis has also been suggested, but there is little evidence for this cause. In adults with incontinence (fecal, urinary, or both), the rash is sometimes called incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD).

The term diaper candidiasis is used when a fungal origin is identified. The distinction is important because the treatment is different (antifungals).

== Causes ==
Irritant diaper dermatitis develops when skin is exposed to prolonged wetness, increased skin pH caused by the combination, and subsequent reactions, of urine and feces, and resulting breakdown of the stratum corneum, or outermost layer of the skin. This may be due to diarrhea, frequent stools, tight diapers, overexposure to ammonia, or allergic reactions. In adults, the stratum corneum is composed of 25 to 30 layers of flattened dead keratinocytes, which are continuously shed and replaced from below. These dead cells are interlaid with lipids secreted by the stratum granulosum just underneath, which help to make this layer of the skin a waterproof barrier. The stratum corneum&#x27;s function is to reduce water loss, repel water, protect deeper layers of the skin from injury, and to repel microbial invasion of the skin. In infants, this layer of the skin is much thinner and more easily disrupted.

=== Urine ===

Although wetness alone has the effect of macerating the skin, softening the stratum corneum, and greatly increasing susceptibility to friction injury, urine has an additional impact on skin integrity because of its effect on skin pH. While studies show that ammonia alone is only a mild skin irritant, when urea breaks down in the presence of fecal urease it increases pH because ammonia is released, which in turn promotes the activity of fecal enzymes such as protease and lipase. These fecal enzymes increase the skin&#x27;s hydration and permeability to bile salts which also act as skin irritants.

There is no substantial difference in rates of diaper rash in conventional disposable diaper wearers and reusable cloth diaper wearers. &quot;Babies wearing superabsorbent disposable diapers with a central gelling material have fewer episodes of diaper dermatitis compared with their counterparts wearing cloth diapers. However, keep in mind that superabsorbent diapers contain dyes that were suspected to cause allergic contact dermatitis (ACD).&quot; Whether wearing cloth or disposable diapers they should be changed frequently to prevent diaper rash, even if they do not feel wet. To reduce the incidence of diaper rash, disposable diapers have been engineered to pull moisture away from the baby&#x27;s skin using synthetic non-biodegradable gel. Today, cloth diapers can use newly available superabsorbent microfiber cloth placed in a pocket with a layer of light permeable material that contacts the skin. This design serves to pull moisture away from the skin in to the microfiber cloth. This technology is now widely used in commercial pocket cloth diapers brands in developed markets.

=== Diet ===
The interaction between fecal enzyme activity and IDD explains the observation that infant diet and diaper rash are linked because fecal enzymes are in turn affected by diet. Breast-fed babies, for example, have a lower incidence of diaper rash, possibly because their stools have higher pH and lower enzymatic activity. Diaper rash is also most likely to be diagnosed in infants 8–12 months old, perhaps in response to an increase in eating solid foods and dietary changes around that age that affect fecal composition. Any time an infant&#x27;s diet undergoes a significant change (i.e. from breast milk to formula or from milk to solids) there appears to be an increased likelihood of diaper rash.

The link between feces and IDD is also apparent in the observation that infants are more susceptible to developing diaper rash after treating with antibiotics, which affect the intestinal microflora. Also, there is an increased incidence of diaper rash in infants who have had diarrhea in the previous 48 hours, which may be because fecal enzymes such as lipase and protease are more active in feces which have passed rapidly through the gastrointestinal tract.

=== Secondary infections ===
The significance of secondary infection in IDD remains controversial. There seems to be no link between presence or absence of IDD and microbial counts. Although apparently healthy infants sometimes culture positive for &quot;Candida&quot; and other organisms without exhibiting any symptoms, there does seem to be a positive correlation between the severity of the diaper rash noted and the likelihood of secondary involvement. A wide variety of infections has been reported, including &quot;Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes,&quot; &quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot;, enterococci and &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, but it appears that &quot;Candida&quot; is the most common opportunistic invader in diaper areas.

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of IDD is made clinically, by observing the limitation of an erythematous eruption to the convex surfaces of the genital area and buttocks. If the diaper dermatitis occurs for greater than 3 days it may be colonized with &quot;Candida albicans&quot;, giving it the beefy red, sharply marginated, appearance of diaper candidiasis.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Other rashes that occur in the diaper area include seborrhoeic dermatitis and atopic dermatitis. Both Seborrheic and Atopic dermatitis require individualized treatment; they are not the subject of this article.
*Seborrheic dermatitis, typified by oily, thick yellowish scales, is most commonly seen on the scalp (cradle cap) but can also appear in the inguinal folds.
*Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is associated with allergic reaction, often hereditary. This class of rashes may appear anywhere on the body and is characterized by intense itchiness.

== Treatments ==

Possible treatments include minimizing diaper use, and using barrier creams, mild topical cortisones, and antifungal agents. A variety of other inflammatory and infectious processes can occur in the diaper area and an awareness of these secondary types of diaper dermatitis aids in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of patients.

Overall, there is sparse evidence of sufficient quality to be certain of the effectiveness of the various treatments. Washcloths with cleansing, moisturising and protective properties may be better than soap and water, and skin cleansers may also be better than soap and water, but the certainty of evidence with regard other treatments is very low.

=== Diaper changing ===
The most effective treatment, although not the most practical one, is to discontinue use of diapers, allowing the affected skin to air out. Another option is simply to increase the frequency of diaper changing. Thorough drying of the skin before diapering is a good preventive measure because it is the excess moisture, either from urine and feces or from sweating, that sets the conditions for a diaper rash to occur.

=== Diaper type ===
Some sources claim that diaper rash is more common with cloth diapers. Others claim the material of the diaper is relevant insofar as it can wick and keep moisture away from the baby&#x27;s skin, and preventing secondary &quot;Candida&quot; infection. However, there may not be enough data from good-quality, randomized controlled trials to support or refute disposable diaper use thus far. Furthermore, the effect of non-biodegradable diapers on the environment is a concerning matter for public policy.

=== Creams, ointments ===
Another approach is to block moisture from reaching the skin, and commonly recommended remedies using this approach include oil-based protectants or barrier cream, various over-the-counter &quot;diaper creams&quot;, petroleum jelly, dimethicone and other oils. Such sealants sometimes accomplish the opposite if the skin is not thoroughly dry, in which case they serve to seal the moisture &quot;inside&quot; the skin rather than outside.

Zinc oxide-based ointments such as zinc and castor oil cream, Sudocrem or Pinxav can be effective treatments, especially in prevention, because they have both a drying and an astringent effect on the skin, being mildly antiseptic without causing irritation.

A 2005 meta-analysis found no evidence to support the use of topical vitamin A to treat the condition.

=== Dangers of using powders ===
Various moisture-absorbing powders, such as talcum or starch, reduce moisture but may introduce other complications. Airborne powders of any sort can irritate lung tissue, and powders made from starchy plants (corn, arrowroot) provide food for fungi and are not recommended by the American Academy of Dermatology.

=== Antifungals ===
In persistent or especially bad rashes, an antifungal cream often has to be used. In cases that the rash is more of an irritation, a &quot;mild&quot; topical corticosteroid preparation, e.g. hydrocortisone cream, is used. As it is often difficult to tell a fungal infection apart from a mere skin irritation, many physicians prefer a corticosteroid-and-antifungal combination cream such as hydrocortisone/miconazole.

<doc id="415956" wikidata="Q294901" url="?curid=415956" title="David Caruso">
<text>David Stephen Caruso (born January 7, 1956) is a retired American actor and producer, best known for his roles as Detective John Kelly on the ABC crime drama &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; (1993–1994) and Lieutenant Horatio Caine on the CBS series &quot;&quot; (2002–2012). He appears in the feature films &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;, &quot;First Blood&quot; (1982), &quot;Twins&quot; (1988), &quot;King of New York&quot; (1990), &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; (1995) and &quot;Proof of Life&quot; (2000).

==Early life==
Caruso was born in Forest Hills, Queens, New York, New York, the son of Joan, a librarian, and Charles Caruso, a magazine and newspaper editor. He is of Irish and Italian descent. His father left the family when David was two years old, resulting in him &quot;end[ing] up fathering myself.” Raised as a Roman Catholic, Caruso attended Our Lady Queen of Martyrs Catholic School in Forest Hills, then Archbishop Molloy High School in nearby Briarwood, graduating in 1974.

Caruso worked as a cinema usher, where he claimed to have seen up to 80 movies a week. He said that he and his co-workers would act out scenes from some of these movies while they were at the back of the theater. In this job he found his role models in Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson. He said: &quot;The ethics of certain actors certainly had a power over me. These guys taught me how to be what I consider the real scum of the earth.&quot;

==Career==
===1980s===
Caruso&#x27;s first movie appearance was in the 1980 film &quot;Getting Wasted&quot; as Danny. He credits his role as Topper Daniels, &quot;the cadet who nearly drowned&quot;, in &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot; (1982) as what got him noticed. Caruso then spent most of the decade in supporting roles in films including &quot;First Blood&quot; (1982), &quot;Blue City&quot; (1986), &quot;China Girl&quot; (1987) and &quot;Twins&quot; (1988).

On television, Caruso had a recurring role as Tommy Mann, leader of the street gang The Shamrocks, in seven episodes of the NBC police drama series &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; (1981–83). He portrayed U.S. Olympian James Brendan Connolly in the 1984 miniseries, &quot;The First Olympics: Athens 1896&quot;, and also appeared in two episodes of the series &quot;Crime Story&quot;.

Caruso featured in the music video for the song &quot;Voyage, voyage&quot; by the French singer Desireless, released in 1986.

===1990s===
Caruso had supporting roles as a police officer in the crime films &quot;King of New York&quot; (1990) and &quot;Mad Dog and Glory&quot; (1993). While filming 1991&#x27;s &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot;, he employed method acting, refusing to talk to anyone on set because his character, Kit-Kat, was mute, having had his tongue bitten off.

In 1993, Caruso landed his first major role as Detective John Kelly in the police procedural series &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, for which he won a Golden Globe Award. &quot;TV Guide&quot; named him as one of the six new stars to watch in the 1993–1994 season. He made news by leaving the highly rated show the following year (only four episodes into the second season) after failing to obtain the raise he wanted. His decision to leave the series would later be listed in a 2010 issue of &quot;TV Guide&quot; as #6 on a list of TV&#x27;s 10 biggest &quot;blunders&quot;.

He was unable to establish himself as a leading man in films. His appearances in the 1995 thrillers &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; and &quot;Jade&quot; were met with a negative reception from critics, with both films receiving mixed reviews and poor box-office takings, and Caruso was nominated for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst New Star for these two roles.

In 1997, Caruso returned to television as a New York City-based federal prosecutor in the short-lived CBS law drama series &quot;Michael Hayes&quot;, which aired for one season.

===2000s and &quot;CSI: Miami&quot;===
Caruso returned to film with a supporting role as Russell Crowe&#x27;s mercenary associate in &quot;Proof of Life&quot; (2000). In 2001, he had a lead role in the cult psychological horror film &quot;Session 9&quot;, directed by Brad Anderson. Dave Kehr, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praises his performance, stating that &quot;it is good to see David Caruso back in action, with a little more technique and a little less ego.&quot;
In 2002, Caruso returned to television in his first successful role since &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, starring as police Lieutenant Horatio Caine in the &quot;&quot; spin-off series &quot;&quot;. He was the first actor in the franchise to appear as the same character on three of the five &quot;CSI&quot; programs. He was known for frequently using one-liners at the beginning of each episode. Many of these include him putting on his trademark sunglasses mid-sentence, then walking off-screen just as the main theme starts. On an episode of the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; that aired on March 8, 2007, actor and comedian Jim Carrey professed to being a fan of the show and went on to do an impersonation of Caruso, asking for an &quot;intense close-up&quot; from the camera, speaking in a raspy voice and putting on sunglasses. Caruso later said in an interview with CBS that he was impressed with the impersonation.

In 2012, &quot;CSI: Miami&quot; was cancelled after 10 seasons due to a decline in ratings and the climbing cost of production. Caruso was the only actor to appear in all 232 episodes of the series.

===After acting===
After &quot;CSI: Miami&quot;, Caruso quietly retired from acting and became involved in the art business.

Caruso is founder of DavidCarusoTelevision.tv and LexiconDigital.tv. He is co-owner of Steam on Sunset, a clothing store in South Miami.

==Personal life==
Caruso was married to his first wife Cheri Maugans from 1979 until they divorced in 1984. He was married to his second wife Rachel Ticotin from 1984 to 1987, with whom he has a daughter, Greta. He and former girlfriend Liza Marquez have two children together: a son Marquez and a daughter Paloma. In April 2009, Marquez filed papers against Caruso for fraud, breach of their settlement agreement and emotional distress.

In March 2009, a woman was placed in custody in Tyrol, Austria, on charges of stalking Caruso. She had twice failed to appear in court to answer the charges before fleeing to Mexico. Following her deportation from Mexico, Austrian officials took her into custody to await trial on the stalking charges.

==Awards and nominations==
In 1994, Caruso won a Golden Globe Award for his John Kelly role on &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; for which he was also nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. In 2001, he was nominated for the Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Supporting Actor – Suspense for his role as Dino in the film &quot;Proof of Life&quot;.

<doc id="415958" wikidata="Q462116" url="?curid=415958" title="Frank J. Tipler">
<text>Frank Jennings Tipler (born February 1, 1947) is an American mathematical physicist and cosmologist, holding a joint appointment in the Departments of Mathematics and Physics at Tulane University. Tipler has written books and papers on the Omega Point based on Pierre Teilhard de Chardin&#x27;s religious ideas, which he claims is a mechanism for the resurrection of the dead. He is also known for his theories on the Tipler cylinder time machine. His work has attracted criticism, most notably from Quaker and systems theorist George Ellis, who has argued that his theories are largely pseudoscience.

==Biography==
Tipler was born in Andalusia, Alabama, to Frank Jennings Tipler Jr., a lawyer, and Anne Tipler, a homemaker. Tipler attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1965 to 1969, where he completed a Bachelor of Science degree in physics. In 1976 he completed his PhD with the University of Maryland. Tipler was hired in a series of postdoctoral research positions at three universities, with the final one being at the University of Texas, working under John Archibald Wheeler, Abraham Taub, Rainer K. Sachs, and Dennis W. Sciama. Tipler became an associate professor in mathematical physics in 1981 and a full professor in 1987 at Tulane University, where he has been a faculty member ever since.

== The Omega Point cosmology ==
The &quot;Omega Point&quot; is a term Tipler uses to describe a cosmological state in the distant proper-time future of the universe. He claims that this point is required to exist due to the laws of physics. According to him, it is required, for the known laws of physics to be consistent, that intelligent life take over all matter in the universe and eventually force its collapse. During that collapse, the computational capacity of the universe diverges to infinity, and environments emulated with that computational capacity last for an infinite duration as the universe attains a cosmological singularity. This singularity is Tipler&#x27;s Omega Point. With computational resources diverging to infinity, Tipler states that a society in the far future would be able to resurrect the dead by emulating alternative universes. Tipler identifies the Omega Point with God, since, in his view, the Omega Point has all the properties of God claimed by most traditional religions.

Tipler&#x27;s argument of the Omega Point being required by the laws of physics is a more recent development that arose after the publication of his 1994 book &quot;The Physics of Immortality&quot;. In that book (and in papers he had published up to that time), Tipler had offered the Omega Point cosmology as a hypothesis, while still claiming to confine the analysis to the known laws of physics.

Tipler, along with co-author physicist John D. Barrow, defined the &quot;final anthropic principle&quot; (FAP) in their 1986 book &quot;The Anthropic Cosmological Principle&quot; as a generalization of the anthropic principle:
One paraphrasing of Tipler&#x27;s argument for FAP runs as follows: For the universe to physically exist, it must contain living observers. Our universe obviously exists. There must be an &quot;Omega Point&quot; that sustains life forever.

Tipler purportedly used Dyson&#x27;s eternal intelligence hypothesis to back up his arguments.

===Reception===
Tipler&#x27;s Omega Point theory has been highly controversial. In the past (1997), physicist David Deutsch defended the physics of Omega Point cosmology, although he was highly critical of Tipler&#x27;s theological conclusions and what Deutsch stated were exaggerated claims (that caused other scientists and philosophers to reject his theory). However, Deutsch has since rejected the theory, referring to it as &quot;refuted&quot; and &quot;ruled out by observation&quot;. Scholars are also skeptical of Tipler&#x27;s argument that if an immortal entity with advanced technology exists in the future, such a being would necessarily resemble the Abrahamic God. Researcher Anders Sandberg pointed out that he believes that the Omega Point Theory has many flaws, including missing proofs of its claims.

Tipler&#x27;s Omega Point ideas have received vigorous criticism by physicists and skeptics. Some critics say its arguments violate the Copernican principle, that it incorrectly applies the laws of probability, and that it is really a theology or metaphysics principle made to sound plausible to laypeople by using the esoteric language of physics. Martin Gardner dubbed the final anthropic principle the &quot;completely ridiculous anthropic principle&quot; (CRAP). Oxford-based philosopher Nick Bostrom writes that the final anthropic principle is &quot;pure speculation&quot; with no claim on any special methodological status, despite attempts to elevate it by calling it a &quot;principle&quot;, but considers the Omega Point hypothesis to be an interesting philosophical hypothesis in its own right. Philosopher Rem B. Edwards called the theory &quot;futuristic, pseudoscientific eschatology&quot; that is &quot;highly conjectural, unverified, and improbable&quot;. A review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Tipler&#x27;s &quot;final anthropic principle&quot; argument as &quot;rather circular&quot;.

George Ellis, writing in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, described Tipler&#x27;s book on the Omega Point as &quot;a masterpiece of pseudoscience… the product of a fertile and creative imagination unhampered by the normal constraints of scientific and philosophical discipline&quot; and Tipler himself as &#x27;the ultimate reductionist&#x27;, citing Tipler&#x27;s argument that &#x27;religion is now a part of science&#x27;. Michael Shermer devoted a chapter of &quot;Why People Believe Weird Things&quot; to enumerating what he thought to be flaws in Tipler&#x27;s thesis. Physicist Sean M. Carroll states that Tipler&#x27;s early work was constructive, but now he has become a &quot;crackpot&quot;. In a review of Tipler&#x27;s &quot;The Physics of Christianity&quot;, Lawrence Krauss described the book as the most &quot;extreme example of uncritical and unsubstantiated arguments put into print by an intelligent professional scientist&quot;.

John Polkinghorne described Tipler as having &quot;extreme reductionism&quot; and building a &quot;cosmic tower of Babel&quot;. He also mentioned that Tipler&#x27;s book &quot;reads like the highest class of science fiction&quot;. Polkinghorne himself asserted that the hope of resurrection &quot;lies not in the curiosity or calculation of a cosmic computer, but in the personal God who cares individually for each of His human creatures&quot;.

<text>Fractional-reserve banking is the system of banking in all countries worldwide, under which banks that take deposits from the public keep only part of their deposit liabilities in liquid assets as a reserve, typically lending the remainder to borrowers. Bank reserves are held as cash in the bank or as balances in the bank&#x27;s account at the central bank. Fractional-reserve banking differs from the hypothetical alternative model, full-reserve banking, in which banks would keep all depositor funds on hand as reserves.

The country&#x27;s central bank may determine a minimum amount that banks must hold in reserves, called the &quot;reserve requirement&quot; or &quot;reserve ratio&quot;. Most commercial banks hold more than this minimum amount as excess reserves. Some countries, e.g. the core Anglosphere countries of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and the three Scandinavian countries, do not impose reserve requirements at all.

Bank deposits are usually of a relatively short-term duration, and may be &quot;at call&quot;, while loans made by banks tend to be longer-term, resulting in a risk that customers may at any time collectively wish to withdraw cash out of their accounts in excess of the bank reserves. The reserves only provide liquidity to cover withdrawals within the normal pattern. Banks and the central bank expect that in normal circumstances only a proportion of deposits will be withdrawn at the same time, and that reserves will be sufficient to meet the demand for cash. However, banks may find themselves in a shortfall situation when depositors wish to withdraw more funds than the reserves held by the bank. In that event, the bank experiencing the liquidity shortfall may borrow short-term funds in the interbank lending market from banks with a surplus. In exceptional situations, such as during an unexpected bank run, the central bank may provide funds to cover the short-term shortfall as lender of last resort.

As banks hold in reserve less than the amount of their deposit liabilities, and because the deposit liabilities are considered money in their own right (see commercial bank money), fractional-reserve banking permits the money supply to grow beyond the amount of the underlying base money originally created by the central bank. In most countries, the central bank (or other monetary policy authority) regulates bank-credit creation, imposing reserve requirements and capital adequacy ratios. This helps ensure that banks remain solvent and have enough funds to meet demand for withdrawals, and can be used to influence the process of money creation in the banking system. However, rather than directly controlling the money supply, contemporary central banks usually pursue an interest-rate target to control bank issuance of credit and the rate of inflation.

==History==
Fractional-reserve banking predates the existence of governmental monetary authorities and originated with bankers&#x27; realization that generally not all depositors demand payment at the same time. In the past, savers looking to keep their coins and valuables in safekeeping depositories deposited gold and silver at goldsmiths, receiving in exchange a note for their deposit (&quot;see Bank of Amsterdam&quot;). These notes gained acceptance as a medium of exchange for commercial transactions and thus became an early form of circulating paper money. As the notes were used directly in trade, the goldsmiths observed that people would not usually redeem all their notes at the same time, and they saw the opportunity to invest their coin reserves in interest-bearing loans and bills. This generated income for the goldsmiths but left them with more notes on issue than reserves with which to pay them. A process was started that altered the role of the goldsmiths from passive guardians of bullion, charging fees for safe storage, to interest-paying and interest-earning banks. Thus fractional-reserve banking was born.

If creditors (note holders of gold originally deposited) lost faith in the ability of a bank to pay their notes, however, many would try to redeem their notes at the same time. If, in response, a bank could not raise enough funds by calling in loans or selling bills, the bank would either go into insolvency or default on its notes. Such a situation is called a bank run and caused the demise of many early banks.

These early financial crises led to the creation of central banks. The Swedish Riksbank was the world&#x27;s first central bank, created in 1668. Many nations followed suit in the late 1600s to establish central banks which were given the legal power to set a reserve requirement, and to specify the form in which such assets (called the monetary base) were required to be held. In order to mitigate the impact of bank failures and financial crises, central banks were also granted the authority to centralize banks&#x27; storage of precious metal reserves, thereby facilitating transfer of gold in the event of bank runs, to regulate commercial banks, and to act as lender-of-last-resort if any bank faced a bank run. The emergence of central banks reduced the risk of bank runs which is inherent in fractional-reserve banking, and it allowed the practice to continue as it does today. where it is the system of banking prevailing in almost all countries worldwide.

During the twentieth century, the role of the central bank grew to include influencing or managing various macroeconomic policy variables, including measures of inflation, unemployment, and the international balance of payments. In the course of enacting such policy, central banks have from time to time attempted to manage interest rates, reserve requirements, and various measures of the money supply and monetary base.

== Regulatory framework==
In most legal systems, a bank deposit is not a bailment. In other words, the funds deposited are no longer the property of the customer. The funds become the property of the bank, and the customer in turn receives an asset called a deposit account (a checking or savings account). That deposit account is a &quot;liability&quot; on the balance sheet of the bank.

Each bank is legally authorized to issue credit up to a specified multiple of its reserves, so reserves available to satisfy payment of deposit liabilities are less than the total amount which the bank is obligated to pay in satisfaction of demand deposits. Largely, fractional-reserve banking functions smoothly, as relatively few depositors demand payment at any given time, and banks maintain enough of a buffer of reserves to cover depositors&#x27; cash withdrawals and other demands for funds. However, during a bank run or a generalized financial crisis, demands for withdrawal can exceed the bank&#x27;s funding buffer, and the bank will be forced to raise additional reserves to avoid defaulting on its obligations. A bank can raise funds from additional borrowings (e.g., by borrowing in the interbank lending market or from the central bank), by selling assets, or by calling in short-term loans. If creditors are afraid that the bank is running out of reserves or is insolvent, they have an incentive to redeem their deposits as soon as possible before other depositors access the remaining reserves. Thus the fear of a bank run can actually precipitate the crisis.

Many of the practices of contemporary bank regulation and central banking—including centralized clearing of payments, central bank lending to member banks, regulatory auditing, and government-administered deposit insurance—are designed to prevent the occurrence of such bank runs.

==Economic function==
Fractional-reserve banking allows banks to provide credit, which represent immediate liquidity to borrowers. The banks also provide longer-term loans, and act as financial intermediaries for those funds. Less liquid forms of deposit (such as time deposits) or riskier classes of financial assets (such as equities or long-term bonds) may lock up a depositor&#x27;s wealth for a period of time, making it unavailable for use on demand. This &quot;borrowing short, lending long&quot; or maturity transformation function of fractional-reserve banking is a role that, according to many economists, can be considered to be an important function of the commercial banking system.

The process of fractional-reserve banking expands the money supply of the economy but also increases the risk that a bank cannot meet its depositor withdrawals. Modern central banking allows banks to practice fractional-reserve banking with inter-bank business transactions with a reduced risk of bankruptcy.

Additionally, according to macroeconomic theory, a well-regulated fractional-reserve bank system could be used by the central bank to influence the money supply and interest rates. Influencing interest rates are an important part of monetary policy used by central banks to promote macroeconomic stability. Historically, central banks have occasionally changed reserve requirements discretionarily in order to influence the money supply directly and via that mechanism the interest rate level. Today, however, this implementation policy is rarely used. In the US, the Federal Reserve eliminated reserve requirements entirely in 2020, instead preferring to use changes in the interest rate paid on reserves held by commercial banks as its most important monetary policy instrument to directly influence the broader interest rate level in the economy.

==Money creation process==

When a loan is made by the commercial bank, the bank creates new demand deposits and the money supply expands by the size of the loan.

The proceeds of most bank loans are not in the form of currency. Banks typically make loans by accepting promissory notes in exchange for credits they make to the borrowers&#x27; deposit accounts. Deposits created in this way are sometimes called derivative deposits and are part of the process of creation of money by commercial banks. Issuing loan proceeds in the form of paper currency and current coins is considered to be a weakness in internal control.

The money creation process is also affected by the currency drain ratio (the propensity of the public to hold banknotes rather than deposit them with a commercial bank), and the safety reserve ratio (excess reserves beyond the legal requirement that commercial banks voluntarily hold). Data for reserves and vault cash are published regularly by the Federal Reserve in the United States. The Federal Reserve does not impose a reserve requirement, but pays interest on reserve balances, influencing the general interest rate level in the economy in that way.

Just as taking out a new loan expands the money supply, the repayment of bank loans reduces the money supply.

===Types of money===

There are two types of money created in a fractional-reserve banking system operating with a central bank:

# Central bank money: money created or adopted by the central bank regardless of its form – precious metals, commodity certificates, banknotes, coins, electronic money loaned to commercial banks, or anything else the central bank chooses as its form of money.
# Commercial bank money: demand deposits in the commercial banking system; also referred to as &quot;chequebook money&quot;, &quot;sight deposits&quot; or simply &quot;credit&quot;.

==Money multiplier==

The money multiplier is a heuristic traditionally used to demonstrate the maximum amount of broad money that could be created by commercial banks for a given fixed amount of base money and reserve ratio. This theoretical maximum is never reached, because some eligible reserves are held as cash outside of banks. Rather than holding the quantity of base money fixed, contemporary central banks typically focus on setting and maintaining target interest rates in order to satisfy their monetary policy goals, implying that the theoretical ceiling imposed by the money multiplier does not impose a limit on money creation in practice.

===Formula===
The money multiplier, &quot;m&quot;, is the inverse of the reserve requirement, &quot;R&quot;:
:formula_1

In countries where the central bank does not impose a reserve requirement, such as the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, the theoretical money multiplier is undefined, having a denominator of zero.

==Money supply==


In countries with fractional-reserve banking, commercial bank money usually forms the majority of the money supply. The acceptance and value of commercial bank money is based on the fact that it can be exchanged freely at a commercial bank for central bank money.

The actual increase in the money supply through this process may be lower, as (at each step) banks may choose to hold reserves in excess of the statutory minimum, borrowers may let some funds sit idle, and some members of the public may choose to hold cash, and there also may be delays or frictions in the lending process. Government regulations may also limit the money creation process by preventing banks from giving out loans even when the reserve requirements have been fulfilled.

==Regulation==
Because the nature of fractional-reserve banking involves the possibility of bank runs, central banks have been created throughout the world to address these problems.

===Central banks===

Government controls and bank regulations related to fractional-reserve banking have generally been used to impose restrictive requirements on note issue and deposit-taking on the one hand, and to provide relief from bankruptcy and creditor claims, and/or protect creditors with government funds, when banks defaulted on the other hand. Such measures have included:
# Minimum required reserve ratios (RRRs)
# Minimum capital ratios
# Government bond deposit requirements for note issue
# 100% Marginal Reserve requirements for note issue, such as the Bank Charter Act 1844 (UK)
# Sanction on bank defaults and protection from creditors for many months or even years, and
# Central bank support for distressed banks, and government guarantee funds for notes and deposits, both to counteract bank runs and to protect bank creditors.

===Reserve requirements===
The currently prevailing view of reserve requirements is that they are intended to prevent banks from:
# Generating too much money by making too many loans against a narrow money deposit base;
# Having a shortage of cash when large deposits are withdrawn (although a legal minimum reserve amount is often established as a regulatory requirement, reserves may be made available on a temporary basis in the event of a crisis or bank run).

In some jurisdictions (such as the European Union), the central bank does not require reserves to be held during the day. Reserve requirements are intended to ensure that the banks have sufficient supplies of highly liquid assets, so that the system operates in an orderly fashion and maintains public confidence.

In other jurisdictions (such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and the Scandinavian countries), the central bank does not require reserves to be held at any time – that is, it does not impose reserve requirements.

In addition to reserve requirements, there are other required financial ratios that affect the amount of loans that a bank can fund. The capital requirement ratio is perhaps the most important of these other required ratios. When there are no mandatory reserve requirements, which are considered by some economists to restrict lending, the capital requirement ratio acts to prevent an infinite amount of bank lending.

===Liquidity and capital management for a bank===

To avoid defaulting on its obligations, the bank must maintain a minimal reserve ratio that it fixes in accordance with regulations and its liabilities. In practice this means that the bank sets a reserve ratio target and responds when the actual ratio falls below the target. Such response can be, for instance:
# Selling or redeeming other assets, or securitization of illiquid assets,
# Restricting investment in new loans,
# Borrowing funds (whether repayable on demand or at a fixed maturity),
# Issuing additional capital instruments, or
# Reducing dividends.

Because different funding options have different costs and differ in reliability, banks maintain a stock of low cost and reliable sources of liquidity such as:
# Demand deposits with other banks
# High quality marketable debt securities
# Committed lines of credit with other banks

As with reserves, other sources of liquidity are managed with targets.

The ability of the bank to borrow money reliably and economically is crucial, which is why confidence in the bank&#x27;s creditworthiness is important to its liquidity. This means that the bank needs to maintain adequate capitalisation and to effectively control its exposures to risk in order to continue its operations. If creditors doubt the bank&#x27;s assets are worth more than its liabilities, demand creditors have an incentive to demand payment immediately, causing a bank run to occur.

Contemporary bank management methods for liquidity are based on maturity analysis of all the bank&#x27;s assets and liabilities (off balance sheet exposures may also be included). Assets and liabilities are put into residual contractual maturity buckets such as &#x27;on demand&#x27;, &#x27;less than 1 month&#x27;, &#x27;2–3 months&#x27; etc. These residual contractual maturities may be adjusted to account for expected counterparty behaviour such as early loan repayments due to borrowers refinancing and expected renewals of term deposits to give forecast cash flows. This analysis highlights any large future net outflows of cash and enables the bank to respond before they occur. Scenario analysis may also be conducted, depicting scenarios including stress scenarios such as a bank-specific crisis.

==Hypothetical example of a bank balance sheet and financial ratios==
An example of fractional-reserve banking, and the calculation of the &quot;reserve ratio&quot; is shown in the balance sheet below:
In this example the cash reserves held by the bank is NZ$3,010m (NZ$201m cash + NZ$2,809m balance at Central Bank) and the demand deposits (liabilities) of the bank are NZ$25,482m, for a cash reserve ratio of 11.81%.

=== Other financial ratios ===
The key financial ratio used to analyze fractional-reserve banks is the cash reserve ratio, which is the ratio of cash reserves to demand deposits. However, other important financial ratios are also used to analyze the bank&#x27;s liquidity, financial strength, profitability etc.

For example, the ANZ National Bank Limited balance sheet above gives the following financial ratios:
# Cash reserve ratio is $3,010m/$25,482m, i.e., 11.81%.
# Liquid assets reserve ratio is ($201m + $2,809m + $1,797m)/$25,482m, i.e., 18.86%.
# Equity capital ratio is $8,703m/107,787m, i.e., 8.07%.
# Tangible equity ratio is ($8,703m − $3,297m)/107,787m, i.e., 5.02%
# Total capital ratio is ($8,703m + $2,062m)/$107,787m, i.e., 9.99%.

It is important how the term &quot;reserves&quot; is defined for calculating the reserve ratio, as different definitions give different results. Other important financial ratios may require analysis of disclosures in other parts of the bank&#x27;s financial statements. In particular, for liquidity risk, disclosures are incorporated into a note to the financial statements that provides maturity analysis of the bank&#x27;s assets and liabilities and an explanation of how the bank manages its liquidity.

== Commentary ==

=== Instability ===
In 1935, economist Irving Fisher proposed a system of full-reserve banking, where banks would not lend on demand deposits but would only lend from time deposits. It was proposed as a method of reversing the deflation of the Great Depression, as it would give the central bank (the Federal Reserve in the US) more direct control of the money supply.

=== Austrian School criticism ===
Austrian School economists such as Jesús Huerta de Soto and Murray Rothbard have strongly criticized fractional-reserve banking, calling for it to be outlawed and criminalized. According to them, not only does money creation cause macroeconomic instability (based on the Austrian Business Cycle Theory), but it is a form of embezzlement or financial fraud, legalized only due to the influence of powerful rich bankers on corrupt governments around the world. US politician Ron Paul has also criticized fractional-reserve banking based on Austrian School arguments.

===Descriptions===

Adair Turner, former chief financial regulator of the United Kingdom, stated that banks &quot;create credit and money &quot;ex nihilo&quot; extending a loan to the borrower and simultaneously crediting the borrower&#x27;s money account&quot;.

<text>John Wilder Tukey (; June 16, 1915 – July 26, 2000) was an American mathematician and statistician, best known for the development of the fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm and box plot. The Tukey range test, the Tukey lambda distribution, the Tukey test of additivity, and the Teichmüller–Tukey lemma all bear his name. He is also credited with coining the term &quot;bit&quot; and the first published use of the word &quot;software&quot;.

== Biography ==
Tukey was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, in 1915, to a Latin teacher father and a private tutor. He was mainly taught by his mother and attended regular classes only for certain subjects like French. Tukey obtained a B.A. in 1936 and M.S. in 1937 in chemistry, from Brown University, before moving to Princeton University, where in 1939 he received a PhD in mathematics after completing a doctoral dissertation titled &quot;On denumerability in topology&quot;.

During World War II, Tukey worked at the Fire Control Research Office and collaborated with Samuel Wilks and William Cochran. He is claimed to have helped design the U-2 spy plane. After the war, he returned to Princeton, dividing his time between the university and AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories. In 1962, Tukey was elected to the American Philosophical Society. He became a full professor at 35 and founding chairman of the Princeton statistics department in 1965.

Among many contributions to civil society, Tukey served on a committee of the American Statistical Association that produced a report critiquing the statistical methodology of the Kinsey Report, &quot;Statistical Problems of the Kinsey Report on Sexual Behavior in the Human Male&quot;, which summarized &quot;A random selection of three people would have been better than a group of 300 chosen by Mr. Kinsey&quot;.

From 1960 to 1980, Tukey helped design the NBC television network polls used to predict and analyze elections. He was also a consultant to the Educational Testing Service, the Xerox Corporation, and Merck &amp; Company.

During the 1970s and early 1980s, Tukey played a key role in the design and conduct of the National Assessment of Educational Progress.

He was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Nixon in 1973. He was awarded the IEEE Medal of Honor in 1982 &quot;For his contributions to the spectral analysis of random processes and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm&quot;.

Tukey retired in 1985. He died in New Brunswick, New Jersey, on July 26, 2000.

== Scientific contributions ==
Early in his career Tukey worked on developing statistical methods for computers at Bell Labs, where he invented the term &quot;bit&quot; in 1947.

His statistical interests were many and varied. He is particularly remembered for his development with James Cooley of the Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm. In 1970, he contributed significantly to what is today known as the jackknife—also termed Quenouille–Tukey jackknife. He introduced the box plot in his 1977 book, &quot;Exploratory Data Analysis&quot;.

Tukey&#x27;s range test, the Tukey lambda distribution, Tukey&#x27;s test of additivity, Tukey&#x27;s lemma, and the Tukey window all bear his name. He is also the creator of several little-known methods such as the trimean and median-median line, an easier alternative to linear regression.

In 1974, he developed, with Jerome H. Friedman, the concept of the projection pursuit.

=== Data analysis and foundations of data science ===

John Tukey contributed greatly to statistical practice and data analysis in general. In fact, some regard John Tukey as the father of data science. At the very least, he pioneered many of the key foundations of what came later to be known as data science.

Making sense of data has a long history and has been addressed by statisticians, mathematicians, scientists, and others for many many years. During the 1960s, Tukey challenged the dominance at the time of what he called &quot;confirmatory data analysis&quot;, statistical analyses driven by rigid mathematical configurations. Tukey emphasized the importance of having a more flexible attitude towards data analysis and of exploring data carefully to see what structures and information might be contained therein. He called this &quot;exploratory data analysis&quot; (EDA). In many ways, EDA was a precursor to data science.

Tukey also realized the importance of computer science to EDA. Graphics are an integral part of EDA methodology and, while much of Tukey&#x27;s work focused on static displays (such as box plots) that could be drawn by hand, he realized that computer graphics would be much more effective for studying multivariate data. PRIM-9, the first program for viewing multivariate data, was conceived by him during the early 1970s.

This coupling of data analysis and computer science is what is now called data science.

Tukey articulated the important distinction between exploratory data analysis and confirmatory data analysis, believing that much statistical methodology placed too great an emphasis on the latter. Though he believed in the utility of separating the two types of analysis, he pointed out that sometimes, especially in natural science, this was problematic and termed such situations uncomfortable science.

A. D. Gordon offered the following summary of Tukey&#x27;s principles for statistical practice:
Tukey&#x27;s lectures were described to be unusual. McCullagh described his lecture given in London in 1977:
==Coining the term &quot;bit&quot;==
While working with John von Neumann on early computer designs, Tukey introduced the word &quot;bit&quot; as a portmanteau of &quot;binary digit&quot;. The term &quot;bit&quot; was first used in an article by Claude Shannon in 1948.

<doc id="415977" wikidata="Q649151" url="?curid=415977" title="Full-reserve banking">
<text>Full-reserve banking (also known as 100% reserve banking, or sovereign money system) is a system of banking where banks do not lend demand deposits and instead only lend from time deposits. It differs from fractional-reserve banking, in which banks may lend funds on deposit, while fully reserved banks would be required to keep the full amount of each customer&#x27;s demand deposits in cash, available for immediate withdrawal.

Monetary reforms that included full-reserve banking have been proposed in the past, notably in 1935 by a group of economists, including Irving Fisher, under the so-called &quot;Chicago plan&quot; as a response to the Great Depression.

Currently, no country in the world requires full-reserve banking across primary credit institutions, although Iceland&#x27;s legislature considered it in 2015 after the 2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis. In a 2018 Swiss ballot initiative, 75% of voters voted against the Sovereign Money Initiative which had full reserve banking as a prominent component of its proposed reform of the Swiss monetary system.

== Concepts ==
Full-reserve banking requires banks to maintain 100% reserves against demand deposits. This is a significant change from fractional-reserve banking, where only a small percentage of deposits must be on reserve.

=== Basic Principles ===
Full-reserve banking effectively splits banks into two distinct functions, described by Benes and Kumhof (2012) as the &quot;separation of the monetary and credit functions of the banking system.&quot;

# Custody and Transaction Services: Banks hold deposited currency as 100%-reserve deposits, transferable to third parties.
# Investment Intermediation: Banks would become true intermediaries, transferring from savers to borrowers. Jackson and Dyson (2012) argue this separates transaction accounts and investment accounts.

===Money Creation===
McLeay et al. note that in the current system, &quot;Whenever a bank makes a loan, it simultaneously creates a matching deposit in the borrower&#x27;s bank account, thereby creating new money.&quot; In contrast, Sigurjonsson explains that full-reserve banking, &quot;transfers the power to create money from commercial banks&quot; to the central bank.

This has several implications:

# Money Supply: Dyson et al. argue that banks would no longer be money creators and so generate less financial instability.
# Credit Creation: Kay argues for managing maturity mismatch through markets not within financial institutions.

=== Account Types ===
Full-reserve banking proposes two distinct types of accounts, analyzed by Pennacchi (2012).

# Transaction Accounts 
#* 100% backed by reserves
#* Available for immediate withdrawal
#* May charge service fees
#* Cannot be lent
#* Legally separated from other bank activities
# Investment Accounts
#* Fixed terms for withdrawal
#* Can be used for lending
#* May offer different risk-return profiles
#* Risk explicitly borne by depositor
#* Returns based on investment performance

== History ==
In the 1840s, British Currency School theorists argued for 100% reserves.

In the early 20th century, classical economics was widely accepted. In the 1930s, Keynesianism gained prominence as policymakers sought solutions for the Great Depression.

Economists proposed various strategies to address financial stability, including the Chicago Plan&#x27;s full-reserve banking. Irving Fisher&#x27;s &quot;The Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions&quot; (1933) analyzed how debt cycles contributed to economic instability. Fisher proposed in his 1935 &quot;100% Money&quot; disconnecting money and credit.

Albert G. Hart detailed in 1935 how to maintain economic stability during the transition to 100% reserves. William R. Allen recounted in 1993 how Fisher&#x27;s proposals influenced banking reform discussions. Full-reserve banking did not become law.

Maurice Allais presented a 100% reserve proposal in a 1948 book. Milton Friedman advocated for 100% reserves in 1960 with A Program for Monetary Stability.

James Tobin proposed a deposit currency system in 1985 with aspects of 100% reserves. Laurence Kotlikoff called for 100% reserve banking in his 2010 book Jimmy Stewart Is Dead.

In the 2014 Money Creation and Society debate in the UK Parliament, Zac Goldsmith called for a monetary commission on full reserve banking.

==Views==

=== In favor ===

Economist Milton Friedman at one time advocated a 100% reserve requirement for checking accounts, and economist Laurence Kotlikoff has also called for an end to fractional-reserve banking. Austrian School economist Murray Rothbard has written that reserves of less than 100% constitute fraud on the part of banks and should be illegal, and that full-reserve banking would eliminate the risk of bank runs. Jesús Huerta de Soto, another economist of the Austrian school, has also strongly argued in favor of full-reserve banking and the outlawing of fractional reserve banking.

The financial crisis of 2007–2008 led to renewed interest in full reserve banking and sovereign money issued by a central bank. Monetary reformers point out that fractional reserve banking leads to unpayable debt, growing economic inequality, inevitable bankruptcy, and an imperative for perpetual and unsustainable economic growth. Martin Wolf, chief economist at the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, endorsed full reserve banking, saying &quot;it would bring huge advantages&quot;.

Martin Wolf, Chief Economics Commentator at the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, argues that many people have a fundamentally flawed and oversimplified conception of what it is that banks do. Laurence Kotlikoff and Edward Leamer agree, in a paper entitled &quot;A Banking System We Can Trust&quot;, arguing that the current financial system did not produce the benefits that have been attributed to it. Rather than simply borrowing money from savers to make loans towards investment and production, and holding &quot;money&quot; as a stable liability, banks in reality create credit increasingly for the purpose of acquiring existing assets. Rather than financing real productivity and investment, and generating fair asset prices, Wall Street has come to resemble a casino, in which trade volume of securities skyrockets without having positive impacts on the investment rate or economic growth. The credits and debt banks create play a role in determining how delicate the economy is in the face of crisis. For example, Wall Street caused the housing bubble by financing millions of mortgages that were outside budget constraints, which in turn decreased output by 10 percent.

==== Money supply problems ====
In &quot;The Mystery of Banking&quot;, Murray Rothbard argues that legalized fractional-reserve banking gave banks &quot;carte blanche&quot; to create money out of thin air. Economists that formulated the Chicago Plan following the Great Depression argue that allowing banks to have fractional reserves puts too much power in the hands of banks by allowing them to determine the amount of money in circulation by changing the amount of loans they give out.

==== Fractional-reserve banking fraud issues ====
Deposit bankers become loan bankers when they issue fake warehouse receipts that are not backed by the assets actually held, thus constituting fraud.:97 Rothbard likens this practice to counterfeiting, with the loan banker extracting resources from the public. However, Bryan Caplan argues that fractional-reserve banking does not constitute fraud, as by Rothbard&#x27;s own admission an advertised product must simply meet the &quot;common definition&quot; of that product believed by consumers. Caplan contends that it is part of the common definition of a modern bank to make loans against demand deposits, thus not constituting fraud.

==== Balance sheet fundamentals ====
Furthermore, Rothbard argues that fractional reserve banking is fundamentally unsound because of the timescale of a bank&#x27;s balance sheet. While a typical firm should have its assets be due prior to the payment date of its liabilities, so that the liabilities can be paid, the fractional reserve deposit bank has its demand deposit liabilities due at any point the depositor chooses, and its assets, being the loans it has made with someone else&#x27;s deposits, due at some later date.

=== Against ===

==== New fees ====
Some economists have noted that under full-reserve banking, because banks would not earn revenue from lending against demand deposits, depositors would have to pay fees for the services associated with checking accounts. This, it is felt, would probably be rejected by the public. However, in economies where central banks enact zero and negative interest rate policies, some writers have noted depositors are already paying to put their savings in fractional reserve banks.

==== Shadow banking and unregulated institutions ====
In their influential paper on financial crises, economists Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig warned that under full-reserve banking, since banks would only be permitted to lend out funds where depositors agreed to time-lock their deposits, need for extra credit would drive some borrowers to use unregulated institutions. Unregulated institutions (such as high-yield debt issuers) would take over the economically necessary role of financial intermediation and maturity transformation, therefore destabilizing the financial system and leading to more frequent financial crises.

Writing in response to various writers&#x27; support for full reserve banking, Paul Krugman stated that the idea was &quot;certainly worth talking about&quot;, but worries that it would drive financial activity outside the banking system, into the less regulated shadow banking system.

==== Misses the problem ====
Krugman argues that the 2008 financial crisis was not largely a result of depositors attempting to withdraw deposits from commercial banks, but a large-scale run on shadow banking. As financial markets seemed to have recovered more quickly than the &#x27;real economy&#x27;, Krugman sees the recession more as a result of excess leverage and household balance-sheet issues. Neither of these issues would be addressed by a full-reserve regulation on commercial banks, he claims.
