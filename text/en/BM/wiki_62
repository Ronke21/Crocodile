<text>Eger ( , ; ; also known by other alternative names) is the county seat of Heves County, and the second largest city in Northern Hungary (after Miskolc). A city with county rights, Eger is best known for its medieval castle, thermal baths, baroque buildings, the northernmost Ottoman minaret, and red wines. Its population of around 53,000 (2017) makes it the 19th largest centre of population in Hungary, according to the census. The town is located on the Eger Stream (a tributary of the Tisza river), on the hills between the Mátra and Bükk mountains. The main campus of Eszterházy Károly Catholic University is in Eger. 

==Names and etymology==
The origin of its name is unknown. One suggestion is that the place was named after the alder ( in Hungarian) which grew so abundantly along the banks of the Eger Stream. This explanation seems to be correct because the name of the town reflects its ancient natural environment, and also one of its most typical plants, the alder, large areas of which could be found everywhere on the marshy banks of the Stream although they have since disappeared. The German name of the town: &quot;Erlau&quot;, from &quot;Erlen-au&quot; (&#x27;elder grove&#x27;), also speaks in favour of this supposition. And there is another theory which says that Eger&#x27;s name comes from the Latin word: &quot;ager&quot; (&#x27;field&#x27;). This theory comes from more recent researchers who think that during the 11th and 12th centuries settlers with a Walloon origin moved to this territory. 
The basin of Eger and the hilly region around it have always been very suitable for human settlements, and there are many archaeological findings from the early ages of history, which support this fact.

The other names of the town are in Latin &quot;Agria&quot;, in Serbian and Croatian &quot;Jegar&quot; / or &quot;Jegra&quot; / , in Czech and Slovene &quot;Jager&quot;, in Slovak &quot;Jáger&quot;, in Polish &quot;Eger&quot;, and in Turkish &quot;Eğri&quot;. Nickname: the Hungarian Athens

==Coat of arms==

The shield of Eger developed from the shield of Bishop György Fenesy (1686–1689) after an agreement which was made with him in 1694. The bastion with the three gates on it refers to the existence of the fortress. The rampant unicorn between the two bastions on the side of the shield came from the bishop&#x27;s shield. The sword in the fore-feet of the unicorn symbolises the manorial power of life and death. The snake twisting on the sword stands for the defeat of treachery and hatred by faith. The star and the sun symbolise the alternation of days and nights. And finally, the eagle with a gospel in its clutches refers to apostle and evangelist Saint John who is the patron saint of the Archdiocese of Eger.

==History==
Eger has been inhabited since the Stone Age.

===Reign of Saint Stephen===
Today&#x27;s Eger was formed in the 10th century by St. Stephen (997–1038), the first Christian king of Hungary, who founded an episcopal see in Eger. The first cathedral of Eger was built on Castle Hill, within the present site of Eger Castle. Eger grew around this cathedral, and remains an important religious centre in Hungary.

This settlement took up an important place among the Hungarian towns even in the early Middle Ages. The natural fundamentals of the surroundings (meeting of plains and hills) made it possible to establish economic and cultural relations between the different parts of the country.

During the 11th and 12th centuries, Walloon settlers came from the areas beyond the Rhine. They settled with the kings&#x27; permission, bringing western culture to this region and acclimating the viticulture. The development of the town accelerated with their presence.

===Mongol invasion===
This development was blocked for a short time by the Mongol invasion in 1241, when the town was ransacked and burned down during the episcopacy of Cletus Bél.

After the withdrawal of the Mongols, Eger began to flourish all over again. Lampert, the bishop of Eger, received a permit from Béla IV for building a stone fortress. So the nearly destroyed town revived and reached the peak of its medieval development in the 14th and 15th centuries. During this period the forests which spread to the limits of the town were cleared for the most part, and vines were planted in their place. More and more town-houses were built in the settlement. Roads were constructed among which the ones in the inner town were narrow and twisting but those leading to the northern mining towns were wider. The various surrounding settlements such as Almagyar and Czigléd were built up along with Eger.

===Reign of King Matthias===
During the reign of King Matthias (1458–1490), Eger began to develop again. The gothic-styled Bishops Palace of Eger which can be seen at the present time was reconstructed by the order of bishop János Bekensloer. Building operations continued during the bishoprics of Orbán Dóczy and Tamás Bakócz. The beginning of the reconstruction (in late gothic style) of the cathedral fort can also be linked to their names. After the death of King Matthias, during the bishopric of Hyppolit the so-called Hyppolit Gate was built, this has recently been removed.

===The siege of Eger===

After the Battle of Mohács (1526) a sorrowful period began in the history of Eger. During the dual kingship the town changed hands almost every year and the Ottoman army came closer as well. This circumstance provided the reason for reinforcing the fortress. In the autumn of 1552, Captain István Dobó and his handful of soldiers were successful in defending the fortress and northern Hungary from the expanding Turkish Empire. The first writer of note to draw on the story was the Hungarian renaissance poet and musician Sebestyén Tinódi Lantos (–1556), whose account may have come partly from eyewitnesses. Géza Gárdonyi wrote his novel, &quot;Eclipse of the Crescent Moon&quot; in remembrance of this battle, and his work has been translated into numerous languages.

Despite the fact that István Dobó and his soldiers successfully defended the fortress, it was destroyed during the siege, so it was essential to wholly rebuild it. The reconstruction process of the fortress took place between 1553 and 1596 and Italian artificer officers planned the renovations. The famous Hungarian poet, Bálint Balassi also served here for a few years beginning in April 1578.

===Ottoman rule===
While István Dobó and his soldiers managed to defend the fortress in 1552, in 1596 the captain at that time and the foreign mercenaries under his rule handed it over. This was the beginning of the 91-year-long Turkish rule in Eger. The Eger minaret, which was built at the end of the 17th century, preserves the memory of this period. Among all the buildings of this type, the minaret of Eger is found in the northernmost point of the former Ottoman Empire. During the Turkish occupation Eger became the seat of a vilayet which is a Turkish domain including several sanjaks. Churches were converted into mosques, the castle rebuilt, and other structures erected, including public baths and minarets.

The rule of the Turks in Central Hungary began to collapse after a failed Ottoman attempt to capture Vienna. The Vienna-based Habsburgs, who controlled the rest of Hungary, apart from Transylvania, steadily expelled the Turks from the country. The castle of Eger was starved into surrender by the Crusader army led by Charles of Lorraine in 1687, after the castle of Buda had been retaken in 1686. Eger was relieved from Turkish rule in December, 1687. Although the reoccupation was effected by a siege (which starved out the defenders) and not by a bombardment, the town fell into a very poor state. According to the ... records there were only 413 houses in the area within the town walls which were habitable and most of these were occupied by left over Turkish families.

===Habsburg rule===

After the expelling of the Turks, the town was considered by the imperial regiment as a demesne of the Crown. Leopold I re-established Eger as a free royal borough in 1688, which meant that it was relieved from the ecclesiastic manorial burdens. This state lasted until 1695, when , the returning bishop, had the former legal status of a bishopric town restored by the monarch.

Eger soon began to prosper again. The town was reclaimed by its bishops, which caused many local Protestants to leave. Although the town supported the Hungarian leader Prince Francis II Rákóczi in the 1703–1711 war of independence against the Habsburgs, the Hungarians were eventually defeated by the Imperial army. In 1709, Francis II Rákóczi and Ukranciev, the legate of Peter the Great, met here. It must be added that the legate died in Eger and was buried near the Serbian Church of Eger. Soon after that, the town was ravaged by plague. However, immigration into Eger was strong, and the population rose from 6000 to 10,000 between 1725 and 1750. Muslims were assimilated into the Christian population.

In the history of Eger, the 18th century was the period of development and prosperity. Many new buildings were built in Baroque and later in Rococo and Neoclassical style, including the cathedral, the Archiepiscopal Palace of Eger, the County Hall of Eger, the Eger Lyceum (now housing the Eszterházy College of Education) and several churches, while others were reclaimed from being mosques.

The building processes attracted many craftsman, merchants, and artists, including Kracker János Lukács, Anton Maulberts, , , Jakab Fellner, and Henrik Fasola. The town population grew suddenly. While in 1688 it was only 1200, in 1787 more than 17,000 people lived here. At this time, Eger was the 6th largest town of Hungary (based on the number of its inhabitants). Viticulture also reached its brightest period in these days. The wine-growing area was twelve times larger than it had been earlier.

The 18th century was also important because bishop Barkóczy and Eszterházy decided to found a university in Eger patterned after the ones in Nagyszombat and in Vienna. There were already precedents for this type of education because in 1700 Bishop István Telekessy, who took sides with Ferenc Rákóczy the Second, established a seminary in Eger. Then in 1740, Canon György Foglár founded a Faculty of Law and in 1754 bishop Barkóczy set up a school of philosophy. In 1769 the first medical school of Hungary was opened by the direction of Ferenc Markhot, but it was closed in 1755. Unfortunately the university of Eger could not begin its work because of appoint ... the monarch&#x27;. In the building which was marked out for the university we can find the Archdiocese&#x27;s Library (the most beautiful baroque library in Hungary), and an astronomical museum with original equipment, which was the second museum of this type in Europe. Between 1946 and 1948 there were several more efforts to found a university in Eger all of which also ended in failure.

The 19th century began with disasters: a fire that destroyed half the town in 1800, and a collapse of the south wall of the Castle in 1801, which ruined several houses. Eger became the seat of an archbishopric in 1804, and the church remained in firm control of the town, despite efforts by its citizens to obtain greater freedom. In 1827, much of the town centre was damaged by fire again, and four years later over 200 were killed in an outbreak of cholera.

In 1804, a significant change occurred in the organisation of Eger&#x27;s bishopric. The monarch made this town a centre of archbisphoric, but the bishoprics of Szatmár and Kassa separated from it.

===The Period of Reforms===
The Period of Reforms (1825–1848) left several lasting marks on the life of Eger, especially on its culture. Pyrker László János, the archbishop of that time, founded a gallery which he donated to the Hungarian National Museum because the town did not guarantee an appropriate place for it. It was Pyrker&#x27;s present which served as a base for the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts that was opened in 1900. In 1828 Pyrker established the first Hungarian teachers training college in Eger and he was the one who ordered the construction of the basilica which was built in neo-classical style, in accordance with the plans of József Hild. On the basis of its size, this basilica is the second among the churches of Hungary. In 1837, János Joó, an art teacher, began to edit Hungary&#x27;s first technical journal with the title &quot;Héti Lapok&quot;.
===Revolution and War of Independence===
The inhabitants of Eger took an active part in the revolution in 1848. Even though the revolution was suppressed, the age of landowners and serfs had gone forever, and the municipality gained freedom from the rule of the archbishop in 1854.

===Age of the monarchy===
The main railway line between Miskolc and Pest bypassed the town, which was only reached later by a branch line from Füzesabony. Unfortunately (unlike other towns) Eger&#x27;s civil development did not become faster, as distinguished from other towns, after 1849 and the Compromise of 1867. Industrial development was represented only by the mill, the tobacco factory and the sheet-iron works that were founded in the Reform Age.

During the decades after the turn of the century, the character of a school-town was dominant in Eger. Because of its schools and other cultural institutions, it became known as the Hungarian Athens.

At the beginning of the century, in 1904, the first independent theatre of stone was opened and the canalisation and the provision of public utilities began as well.

===20th century===

Economic recovery was slow after World War I, although the 1899 publication of Gárdonyi&#x27;s &quot;Eclipse of the Crescent Moon&quot; made Eger popular as a tourist attraction and archaeological excavation of the castle resumed.

In 1933, Eger was one of those towns that first got the permission for opening a spa.

In 1910, 2,674 Jews lived in the village but in 1944 the Jewish community was murdered by Hungarians and Germans during the Holocaust.

In World War II, the city suffered under the retreating German Army and the arriving Soviet army, but it managed to escape major bombardment.

In the decades after 1945, industrialization of the town commenced because of the change of regime. As a consequence, Eger&#x27;s former character of a cultural centre began to fade, which diminished the patina of the settlement.

It was of great fortune that in 1968 the baroque inner city was preserved. It was saved from the deterioration (and from the construction of unsuitable, modern buildings).

Eger is famous for its wines, most notably the &quot;Egri Bikavér&quot; (Bull&#x27;s Blood of Eger). It is also well known for &quot;Egri Víz&quot;, a type of brandy which originated in the 18th century, the &quot;bujavászon&quot; (a special Turkish tissue), as well as its thermal baths. 
Today, Eger is a prosperous town and popular tourist destination with a charming Baroque town centre.

==Ecclesiastical history==

Eger is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Eger, an ecclesiastical province of Hungary founded as a bishopric in 1009 and made a Metropolitan archdiocese in 1804, by Pope Pius VII. The current archbishop-elect, Archbishop Csaba Ternyak, was previously Secretary for the Congregation For Clergy. He succeeds Archbishop István Seregely, who retired because of age. The constituent dioceses of the province were Košice (Kassa, Kaschau), Rožňava (Rozsnyó, Rosenau, now part of Slovakia), Szatmár, and Szepes (Zipo, Zipsen).
==Geography==
===Climate===
Eger has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;) closely bordering on an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) or humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;). The annual average temperature of Eger is , and the warmest July has an average temperature of , while January is the only month below freezing, with an average temperature of . The annual precipitation is , of which January is the month with the least precipitation at , while July is the month with the most precipitation at . Temperature extremes ranged from on January 13, 2003 to on July 20, 2007.
==Wine==

Beside its historic sights and its thermal baths, Eger is famous for its wines. It produces both red and white wines of high quality. The famous and traditional varieties of the region are Egri Leányka, Egerszóláti Olaszrizling, Debrői Hárslevelű (whites), and Egri Bikavér (a red). More recently, Chardonnay and Pinot noir wines have appeared. The region&#x27;s wines are said to bear a resemblance to those of Burgundy. Although the quality of the wines deteriorated in the second half of the 20th century, especially the cuvees, Eger is slowly recovering its reputation as a wine region. The most important terroir of the Eger Wine Region is the Nagy-Eged Hill, which is a Grand Cru terroir, where premium Grand Superior wines are produced.

==Tourism==
The majority of visitors come for a single day (mostly from Slovakia), not staying overnight. Ukrainians and Russians frequent the Eger Castle, along with many Italians. Around the town, one may encounter many German-speaking travelers (Germans, Austrians, and Swiss) as well. However, the town is getting more popular for Turkish tourists, because of the common historical memories.
Eger is mainly known for its castle, thermal baths (including an Olympic size swimming pool), historic buildings (including Eger minaret - the northernmost Turkish minaret) and, above all else, its famous Hungarian red wines.

==Transport==

* The Lyceum (Eszterházy College), designed by József Gerl and Jakab Fellner and built in 1765–85, is a splendid example of the restrained Zopf style. There are three remarkable 18th-century frescoed ceilings, of which only the one in the library is open to the public. Painted by the Viennese artist Johann Lukas Kracker in 1778, it depicts the Council of Trent of 1545–63, which launched the Counter-Reformation. Among the figures depicted are the Reformers Luther and Zwingli, whose &quot;heretical&quot; books are being struck by a bolt of lightning. After the death of Kracker in 1779, Esterházy commissioned the Austrian Franz Sigrist (1727–1803) to complete the painting programme. Sigrist painted the ceiling in the Great Hall of the west bay representing the four university faculties (1781–1782). The beautifully furnished library opened in 1793. There is a camera obscura or periscope at the top of the building, projecting images of the town onto a table.

<text>Whitchurch is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority area of Buckinghamshire, England. The village is on the A413 road about north of Aylesbury and south of Winslow. The 2011 Census recorded a parish population of 932.

==Toponym==
The toponym &quot;Whitchurch&quot; is common in England. It derived from the Old English &quot;wit chert&quot;, meaning &quot;white earth&quot;.

==Castle==
Bolbec Castle was built in the Anarchy in the early 12th century. It was burned down by Parliamentary forces in the English Civil War. Its remains are a scheduled monument.

==Parish church==
The oldest parts of the Church of England parish church of Saint John the Evangelist are 13th-century. They include the chancel and the Early English west doorway. The nave has aisles with four-bay arcades. The south aisle was added first, late in the 13th century. The north aisle was added slightly later, and the south door is early 14th-century. Also 14th-century are the sedilia and piscina in the chancel. The west tower was added in the middle of the 14th century, with its eastern buttresses intruding into the north and south aisles. In the 15th century a Perpendicular Gothic porch was added to the south doorway. Also Perpendicular Gothic are the nave&#x27;s clerestory and roof, which are late 15th- or early 16th-century. The church is a Grade II* listed building.

The west tower has a ring of six bells. The oldest are the third and fourth bells, which were cast by an unknown bellfounder in 1619. Henry I Bagley of Chacombe, Northamptonshire cast the treble bell in 1680. The other two bells were cast in 1797, but by two different founders. John Briant of Hertford cast the second bell, but Thomas I Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the tenor. The church has also a Sanctus bell, which was cast in 1708 by one of the Chandler family of bellfounders of Drayton Parslow. Sir Edward Smythe (1602–1682), a retired judge who bought the manor of Whitchurch in about 1669, is buried in the church.

==Economic and social history==

The village used to have a market, which was chartered in 1245. A street of the village is still called Market Hill, and the village still celebrates the granting of its market charter with a May feast each year.

Many of the village&#x27;s cottages and houses are historic. None is a Grade I listed building but two are Grade II* Listed. The Priory in the High Street and The Old House in Church Headland Lane are 15th-century timber-framed houses, each with first-floor jettying. The Priory was altered in the 16th, 19th and 20th centuries, has brick nogging, was a hotel (and restaurant &quot;La Boiserie&quot;) and is now a private house. The Old House was altered in the 17th century and the front was remodelled around 1940.

Nikolaus Pevsner also noted two houses in Oving Road: School House, which is 16th-century, timber-framed and has a jettied first floor; and Whitchurch House, which is early 17th-century and has an early 18th-century façade.

Rex Whistler&#x27;s painting &quot;The Vale of Aylesbury&quot; was created in Whitchurch, where a house is now named after him.

The Firs was used as a facility for developing weapons during the Second World War.

Creslow Transmission Station, now known as Creslow Park located within the parish was a radio transmission station operated by Section VII (Communications) of the Secret Intelligence Service from approximately 1944 to 1990.

==Amenities==
As well as the Priory Hotel (see above) the village now has one public house: The White Swan, at the end of the high street nearest Aylesbury.

Whitchurch Combined School is a community primary school for boys and girls aged 4–11. The school has about 200 pupils. Its catchment area includes the parishes of Whitchurch, Hardwick, Oving, Pitchcott and Weedon. It also includes part of Watermead and the Berryfields and Weedon Hill Major Development Areas (MDAs) in Aylesbury, although new schools are planned for the MDAs.

==Notable residents==
* Steve Rothery, musician with Marillion; lives in Whitchurch
* Sir Edward Smythe (1602–1682), former Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas; retired to Whitchurch and is buried in St John the Evangelist
* Jan Struther, novelist notable for &quot;Mrs Miniver&quot;; lived at Whitchurch House

<doc id="419631" wikidata="Q359674" url="?curid=419631" title="Alternative school">
<text>An alternative school is an educational establishment with a curriculum and methods that are nontraditional. Such schools offer a wide range of philosophies and teaching methods; some have political, scholarly, or philosophical orientations, while others are more &quot;ad hoc&quot; assemblies of teachers and students dissatisfied with some aspect of mainstream or traditional education.

Some schools are based on pedagogical approaches differing from that of the mainstream pedagogy employed in a culture, while other schools are for gifted students, children with special needs, children who have fallen off the track educationally or expelled from their base school, children who wish to explore unstructured or less rigid system of learning, etc.

== Features ==
There are many models of alternative schools but the features of promising alternative programs seem to converge more or less on the following characteristics:
* the approach is more individualized;
* integration of children of different socio-economic status and mixed abilities;
* experiential learning which is applicable to life outside school;
* integrated approach to various disciplines;
* instructional staff is certified in their academic field and are creative;
* low student-teacher ratios;
* collective ownership of the institute as teachers, students, support staff, administrators, parents all are involved in decision making;
* an array of non-traditional evaluation methods.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, &#x27;alternative school&#x27; refers to a school that provides a learner centered informal education as an alternative to the regimen of traditional education in the United Kingdom. There&#x27;s a long tradition of such schools in the United Kingdom, going back to Summerhill, whose founder, A. S. Neill, greatly influenced the spread of similar democratic type schools such as the famous Dartington Hall School, and Kilquhanity School, both now closed. Currently there is one democratic primary school Small Acres, and two democratic secondary schools, Summerhill and Sands School. There is also a range of schools based on the ideas of Maria Montessori and Rudolf Steiner.

==United States==

In the United States, there has been tremendous growth in the number of alternative schools in operation since the 1970s, when relatively few existed. Some alternative schools are for students of all academic levels and abilities who are better served by a non-traditional program. Others are specifically intended for students with special educational needs, address social problems that affect students, such as teenage parenthood or homelessness, or accommodate students who are considered at risk of failing academically.

Another common element of alternative schools in the United States has been the use of community resource professionals in various disciplines who serve as instructors on a part-time, volunteer basis. Depending upon the type of student going into an alternative school, this has sometimes caused friction with the teachers in conventional schools. The Leonia Alternative High School of the 1970s in New Jersey, which placed a heavy emphasis on the use of community resource instructors, ended up in a protracted battle with the local teachers union, resulting in the school eventually closing. While alternative schools became more commonplace by the 1990s, there were still tensions between them and teachers unions regarding the teachers losing central control over such matters.

==Canada==
In Canada, local school boards choose whether or not they wish to have alternative schools and how they are operated. The alternative schools may include multi-age groupings, integrated curriculum or holistic learning, parental involvement, and descriptive reports rather than grades. Some school systems provide alternative education streams within the state schools.

In Canada, schools for children who are having difficulty in a traditional secondary school setting are known as alternate schools.

==France==
In French secondary education, alternative middle schools (&quot;collèges&quot;) and high schools (&quot;lycées&quot;) are referred to respectively by the terms &quot;collège expérimental&quot; and &quot;lycée expérimental&quot;. These schools employ a range of non-traditional teaching and learning methods, including dividing the school day into disciplinary classes and classes that support creativity and individual growth, and the removal of the traditional headmaster role. Many of these schools cater partially or fully to students with learning or behaviour difficulties. Towns in France that have a &quot;collège expérimental&quot; or a &quot;lycée expérimental&quot; include Bordeaux (), Hérouville-Saint-Clair () and La Ciotat.

==Germany==
Germany has over 200 Waldorf schools, including the first such school in the world (founded 1919), and a large number of Montessori schools. Each of these has its own national association, whereas most other alternative schools are organized in the National Association of Independent Alternative Schools (). Funding for private schools in Germany differs from Bundesland to Bundesland.

Full public funding is given to laboratory schools researching school concepts for public education. The Laborschule Bielefeld had a great influence on many alternative schools, including the renewal of the democratic school concept.

==South Korea==
In South Korea, alternative schools serve three big groups of youth. The first group is students who could not succeed in formative Korean education. Many of these schools serve students who dropped out during their earlier school years, either voluntarily or by disciplinary action. The second group is young immigrants. As the population of immigrants from Southeast Asia and North Korea is increasing, several educators started to see the necessity of the adaptive education, specially designed for these young immigrants. Because South Korea has been a monoethnic society throughout its history, there is not enough system and awareness to protect these students from bullying, social isolation, or academic failure. For instance, the drop-out rate for North Korean immigrant students is ten times higher than that of students from South Korean students because their major challenge is initially to adapt to South Korean society, not to get a higher test score.
The other group is students who choose an alternative education because of its philosophy. Korean education, as in many other Asian countries, is based on testing and memorizing. Some students and parents believe this kind of education cannot nurture a student thoroughly and choose to go to an alternative school, that suggests a different way to learn for students. These schools usually stress the importance of interaction between other people and nature over written test results.

The major struggle in alternative schools in South Korea are recognition, lack of financial support, and quality gap between alternative schools. Although South Korean public&#x27;s recognition to alternative education has deliberately changed, the progressive education still is not widely accepted. To enter a college, regular education is often preferred because of the nation&#x27;s rigid educational taste on test result and record. For the same reason, South Korean government is not actively supporting alternative schools financially.

Hence, many alternative schools are at risk of bankruptcy, especially the schools that do not or cannot collect tuition from their students. Most Southeast Asian and North Korean immigrant families are financially in need, so they need assist from government&#x27;s welfare system for their everyday life. It is clear that affording private education is a mere fantasy for these families. That phenomenon, at last, causes a gap among alternative schools themselves. Some schools are richly supported by upper-class parents and provide variety of in-school and after-school programs, and others rarely have resource to build few academic and extracurricular programs as such.

== India ==
India has a long history of alternative schools. Vedic and Gurukul systems of education during 1500 BC to 500 BC emphasized on acquisition of occupational skills, cultural and spiritual enlightenment in an atmosphere which encouraged rational thinking, reasoning among the students. Hence the aim of education was to develop the pupil in various aspects of life as well as ensure social service. However, with the decline of the local economies and the advent of the colonial rulers this system went into decline. Some notable reforms like English as the medium of instruction, were introduced as recommended in Macaulay&#x27;s Minute in the year 1835. The mainstream schools of today still follow the system developed in the colonial era. In the years since independence, Government has focused on expansion of school network, designing of curriculum according to educational needs, local language as the medium of instruction, etc. By the end of nineteenth century, many social reformers began to explore alternatives to contemporary education system. Vivekananda, Dayanand Saraswati, Jyotiba Phule, Savitribai Phule, Syed Ahmed Khan were the pioneers who took up the cause of social regeneration, removal of social inequalities, promotion of girl&#x27;s education through alternate schools. In the early twentieth century educationists create models of alternative schools as a response to the drawbacks to mainstream schools which are still viable. Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s Shanti Niketan, Jiddu Krishnamurthy&#x27;s Rishi Valley School, Sri Aurobindo and Mother&#x27;s Sri Aurobindo International Center for Education, and Walden&#x27;s Path Magnet School are some of the examples. An upsurge in alternative schools was seen in 1970&#x27;s onward. But most of the alternate schools are the result of individual efforts rather than government.

== Alternative Education Programs ==
Alternative education programs are ideal for people who think college education is not a requirement for becoming successful entrepreneurs. These programs educate neophyte and experienced entrepreneurs while providing them with the necessary resources. An article published at Forbes.com last February 11, 2018 mentioned that many educational institutions contribute to their respective accelerator courses. The University of Missouri System initiated the Ameren Accelerator which concentrates on energy startups and assists entrepreneurs in obtaining essential know-how about the industry from educator-partners at the university level. There are international programs that also offer related resources like Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology in Ghana, Africa. It has an incubator program providing seed capital, training, and learning opportunities in a rigorous one-year program from outstanding students in the African region.

The Huffington Post cited options in alternative learning like Home School, Micro Schooling, and Unschooling. The concept of Unschooling means the student learns according to the way that person wants for specific reasons and choice. The individual gets help from teachers, parents, books, or formal classes but makes the final decision on how to proceed and according to his or her preferred schedule. Micro-schools or independent free schools differ in approach, size, and authority. These are contemporary one-room schools, full-time or part-time facilities, or learning centers that are owned and managed by teachers or parents. Some parents choose this non-traditional system over formal education because it teaches youngsters to look for practical solutions. The USA is attempting to serve an increasing number of a good number of at-risk students outside the conventional highs schools. There are Alternative Education Campuses that cater to dropouts or those who have been expelled from their schools. There are reportedly more than 4,000 AECs all over the country.

<text>Rik Aalbert Blyleven (born Blijleven, April 6, 1951) is a Dutch-American former professional baseball pitcher and color commentator. He played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1970 to 1992, primarily with the Minnesota Twins, and from 1996 to 2020 was a color analyst for Minnesota Twins television broadcasts. Blyleven recorded 3,701 career strikeouts, the fifth-most in MLB history. He won 287 games, 27th-most all-time, and pitched 4,970 innings, 14th-most all-time. A renowned curveball pitcher, Blyleven was a two-time All-Star and World Series champion. In 2011, Blyleven was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Blyleven made his major league debut at age 19 for the Twins. In the middle of the 1976 season, he was traded to the Texas Rangers, where he threw a no-hitter in his final start for the team. He won his first World Series with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1979. Upon being traded to the Cleveland Indians, Blyleven initially struggled with injuries, but then enjoyed a late-career resurgence, finishing third in the Cy Young Award voting in back-to-back years, with Cleveland in 1984 and also the following 1985 season that he split between the Indians and Twins. It was during this second stint with Minnesota that Blyleven became the tenth member of the 3,000-strikeout club in 1986 and won a second World Series title in 1987. He played three seasons for the California Angels before retiring.

Blyleven became the first Dutch-born player to earn induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He serves as the pitching coach for the Netherlands national baseball team, having done so in the 2009, 2013, 2017 and 2023 World Baseball Classic.

==Early life==
Rik Aalbert Blyleven was born in Zeist, a municipality in Utrecht, Netherlands, the son of Johannes Cornelius and Jannigje Blijleven. His family moved to Melville, Saskatchewan, when Blyleven was two years old before ultimately settling in Garden Grove, California, in 1957 when Blyleven was five years old. One of seven children, his parents anglicized their names to Joe and Jenny, with Rik Aalbert becoming simply &quot;Bert&quot;.

He became interested in baseball as a young boy watching Sandy Koufax pitch for the Los Angeles Dodgers and listening to Vin Scully and Jerry Doggett announce the Dodgers&#x27; radio broadcasts. Blyleven was quoted as saying, &quot;My dad built me a mound in the backyard with a canvas backdrop over our horseshoe pits, and I would go back there and just throw and throw and throw until I developed it, and it became my curveball. And I could throw it over at any time, any count.&quot;

==Career==
Blyleven starred on the Santiago High School baseball team, also running cross country to build up his stamina and leg strength. He was drafted out of high school by the Minnesota Twins in the third round in . After just 21 minor league starts, he found himself called up to the Majors at age 19 on June 2, 1970. In his first season, his sharp curveball helped him to ten victories, and he was named AL Rookie Pitcher of the Year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. In 1973, he pitched nine shutouts, the most of any AL pitcher that season.

However, Blyleven&#x27;s early career with the Twins was not always pleasant as he was hounded by critics and fans. He clashed with Twins owner Calvin Griffith over his $65,200 salary and refused to sign a 1976 contract with the ballclub. He was traded along with Danny Thompson to the Texas Rangers for Roy Smalley III, Mike Cubbage, Bill Singer and Jim Gideon on June 1, 1976. The transaction was set in motion when Blyleven agreed with the Rangers on a three-year contract with a $550,000 salary two days earlier.

He pitched well with the Rangers, posting a 2.76 ERA. On September 22, 1977, just two weeks after being sidelined with a groin injury, Blyleven no-hit the California Angels 6–0 at Anaheim Stadium. The no-hitter was his final start as a Ranger; not until Cole Hamels during the 2015 season would a pitcher be traded after pitching a no-hitter in his most recent start for the team that traded him. His 2.74 career ERA with the Rangers remains the best in team history.

Following an incident in which Blyleven blatantly gave the finger to a television camera obviously focused on him during one of the Rangers&#x27; rare nationally broadcast games, he was dealt to the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first four-team blockbuster deal in Major League Baseball history on December 8, 1977, that also involved the Atlanta Braves, New York Mets and a total of 11 players changing teams. The Pirates also acquired John Milner from the Mets. The Rangers received Al Oliver and Nelson Norman from the Pirates and Jon Matlack from the Mets. Adrian Devine, Tommy Boggs and Eddie Miller were traded from the Rangers to the Braves. The Mets got from the Braves Willie Montañez and from the Rangers Tom Grieve and Ken Henderson who was sent to New York to complete the transaction three months later on March 15, 1978. With the Pirates, he led the team in ERA, strikeouts, and complete games in , and he helped them to a World Series victory in . His 20 no decisions in 1979 are the most by an MLB starting pitcher in a season, dating back to at least 1908.

Blyleven became disgruntled with the Pirates and threatened to retire during the season if he was not traded. The Pirates traded him to the Cleveland Indians on December 9, 1980. Blyleven sat out most of the season with an elbow injury and struggled again in , but he came back in with one of his best seasons: a 19–7 record with a 2.87 ERA. He missed a second 20-win season that year when he was forced to miss a couple of starts after breaking his foot when joking around in the bullpen. In he again led the American League in shutouts with five. That year, he pitched 293.2 innings and completed 24 games, a feat that has not been repeated since. Blyleven was unhappy playing for the lackluster Indians and forced a trade back to the Twins, where he passed the 3,000-strikeout mark and helped the Twins to a 1987 World Series victory.

Blyleven&#x27;s first two full seasons back with the Twins produced major league records for home runs allowed in a single season (50) and in back-to-back seasons (96). He never surrendered more than 24 home runs in any year before, and after the 1986–87 campaigns, he averaged 21 allowed homers per season over the course of his career.

Blyleven went to the California Angels in and pitched a 2.73 ERA for a 17–5 record in his first season; he led the league for his third and final time in shutouts (5). Blyleven missed the entire season following rotator cuff surgery. He came back in but was mostly unproductive, going 8–12 with a 4.74 ERA. He retired following that season with a career 287–250 record with 3,701 strikeouts and a 3.31 ERA. Only 16 other pitchers have at least 3,000 career strikeouts. He tried out for the Twins again in the spring of , but did not make the squad, which made his retirement official. He pitched for the MLB All-Stars in the 1993 World Port Tournament in Rotterdam.

MLB Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson said of Blyleven: &quot;[his curveball] was nasty, I&#x27;ll tell you that. Enough to make your knees buckle. Bert was a terrific pitcher—a dominating pitcher.&quot;

Blyleven was a pitching coach for the Netherlands in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. He returned in his role for 2013, 2017 and 2023.

==Honors==

After his first year of Baseball Hall of Fame eligibility in 1998, Blyleven was widely considered to be the best eligible pitcher not yet enshrined. According to Matt Welch of &quot;Reason Magazine&quot;, &quot;there had long been a strong case that the Dutch-born curveballista was the most deserving player on the outside of Cooperstown looking in.&quot; Still, it was not until his 14th year of eligibility, in , that he was elected; he received 79.7% of the vote. He currently ranks 5th all-time in strikeouts, 9th all-time in shutouts, and 27th all-time in wins. At the time of his election, he was the only eligible member of the 3,000 strikeout club and the only pitcher with 50 or more shutouts not in the Hall of Fame.

Blyleven received only 17.55% of the vote for Hall of Fame admission in 1998 (his first year of eligibility), and his vote total dropped to 14.1% in 1999. No player who had debuted on the ballot since 1970 had a vote total that low and later won election to the Hall. However, &quot;ESPN.com&quot; columnist Jayson Stark said, &quot;No player has ever—and again, that word is &#x27;ever&#x27;—had his Hall of Fame candidacy helped more by the sabermetrics boom than Blyleven.&quot; Specifically, according to Welch, &quot;the president and chief investment officer of Lederer &amp; Associates Investment Counsel in Long Beach, California, a guy by the name of Rich Lederer, began spending some of his off-hours writing analysis on the Interwebs about Blyleven&#x27;s overlooked case.&quot;

By 2006, his total had increased to 53.33%. In 2007, Blyleven&#x27;s total dipped to 47.7% (75% is the minimum required for admission to the Hall). In 2008, he received 336 votes, or 61.9% of the vote. In 2009, he gained only two votes, for a total of 338, 62.7%. In 2010, Blyleven had 74.2% of the votes, missing admission to the Hall of Fame by only 5 votes (0.8%).

Blyleven was inducted to the Hall of Fame in 2011 after receiving 79.7% of the vote on his 14th attempt. &quot;It&#x27;s been 14 years of praying and waiting,&quot; he said on a conference call from Fort Myers, Florida. &quot;I thank the baseball writers of America for, I&#x27;m going to say, finally getting it right.&quot; Blyleven was the first Dutch-born player inducted, and his Hall of Fame plaque depicts him with a Minnesota Twins cap.

Blyleven was inducted into the Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame in 2002 and was chosen to the fan-elected &quot;Wendy&#x27;s- Minnesota Twins All-Metrodome Team&quot; on July 28, 2009. On July 16, 2011, the Minnesota Twins formally retired Blyleven&#x27;s number.

In 2020, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked Blyleven at number 71 on its &quot;Baseball 100&quot; list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.

==Broadcasting career==

In , Blyleven became a television color analyst for the Twins, calling games for WCCO-TV and Midwest Sports Channel (later Fox Sports North). Blyleven&#x27;s commentary was occasionally risqué for a baseball broadcast but provided interesting and friendly conversation between him and play-by-play announcer Dick Bremer. 

One of his trademarks was circling fans with the telestrator on screen. Fans—both at home and at road games—carried signs to the games saying &quot;Circle me Bert&quot;. This led to a fundraising campaign with the Parkinson&#x27;s Foundation and a sponsorship with the Minnesota Lottery. When announcing partner Bremer attempted to circle fans with the telestrator, he drew geometric forms that were non-circular, and Blyleven and fans started to jostle Bremer with phrases like &quot;Rhombus me, Dick&quot; or &quot;Triangle me, Dick&quot;.

On September 3, 2006, Blyleven accidentally used two profanities on air during a game against the New York Yankees because he believed the broadcast was being taped rather than aired live. FSN North suspended Blyleven five games for the incident, stating: &quot;Bert would never do this intentionally. Having said that, there are consequences for our actions, and we feel this is an appropriate consequence.&quot;

On September 2, 2020, Blyleven broadcast his final game for the Twins.

==Personal life==
He currently resides in Fort Myers, Florida.

Blyleven appeared as himself in the 1990 James Belushi film &quot;Taking Care of Business&quot;. During a 2006 broadcast, Blyleven forgot the name of the movie and had to be reminded of it by a technician in the broadcast booth.

Blyleven was one of baseball&#x27;s most notorious dugout pranksters during his playing days. He earned the moniker &quot;Frying Dutchman&quot; by frequently setting fire to his teammates&#x27; shoelaces, a practical joke known as a &quot;hot foot&quot;. During his time with the Angels, the fire extinguisher in the team&#x27;s clubhouse at Angel Stadium read: &quot;In case of Blyleven: Pull&quot;.

Blyleven did not know his correct name until he was about to get married. He had thought all his life his given name was &quot;Rikaalbert&quot;. He learned that his name actually was Rik Aalbert Blijleven after obtaining a copy of his birth certificate in order to get married.

<text>The Mátra () is a mountain range in northern Hungary, between the towns Gyöngyös and Eger. The country&#x27;s highest peak, Kékestető (1014 m), belongs to this mountain range.

== Formation ==
=== Pre-volcanic formations ===
The formation of the Mátra is closely related to the formation of the North Hungarian Mountains and the Carpathians. Formations formed before the volcanism in the Miocene, are located primarily on the steep northern side of the Mátra. The reason for this is, that after the volcanism, the entire mountain range tilted southward due to the subsidence of the trench extending south of the Mátra and Bükk. The southern, more gentle part was buried by young sediments, while on the northern side steep slopes were formed by landslides during the Pleistocene.

The crystalline basement of the mountain range occurs as inclusions in volcanic rocks. Excluding these, the oldest formations are located along the fault system called the &quot;Darnó line&quot;, which runs northeast-southwest through the Eastern Mátra. The name of the throw is given by the &quot;Darnó Hill&quot; rising between Recsk and Sirok, where Triassic limestone, radiolarite and shale, as well as Middle Pedimentary basalt pillow lavas, and in some places Oedic (Permian) limestone blocks are found.

In many places at the northern foot of the Mátra, Eocene volcanic and carbonate layers are deposited on the Mesozoic formations; most of them are known from drilling, but they also surface north of the Eastern Mátra. These rocks can be linked to the Periadriatic volcanism, which took place in the southern foreland of the Alps. They were brought to their present location by horizontal tectonic movements, so they have nothing to do with the real Mátra volcanism. This period is also represented by the igneous intrusion (intrusion rock body), to which the Recsk skarn ore formation is also related.

The characteristic sediments of the Oligocene age (Buda marl, Tard clay, Kiscell clay) cover the foot of the Mátra in places several hundred meters thick. Their layers are the source rocks of spring waters rich in carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide – the &quot;csevices&quot;. In some places, tuff and tuffite layers are deposited in the Kiscell clay, but these could not be the products of the Mátra volcano, but of a more distant volcano. Above the Kiscell clay, glauconitic sandstone, Parád schlieren and conglomerate layers dating from the beginning of the Miocene can be found; the latter is the bed of Miocene volcanic rocks in most places.

=== Miocene volcanism ===
The main mass of the Mátra is formed by a several hundred-meter-thick layered volcanic rock mass consisting of an alternation of Middle Miocene (Badenian) pyroxeneandesite, andesitetuff and volcanic agglomerate. The driving force of the volcanic activity was the juxtaposition of the two rock plates that make up the Carpathian Basin region, the &quot;Alcapa&quot; and the &quot;Tisza-Dacia&quot;. The migration of the cohesive, rotating tectonic plates was not accompanied by subduction (subduction) but by expansion processes: during these periods, the calcium-rich magma could reach the surface. The &quot;inner-Carpathian calc-alkaline volcanism&quot;, which began about 21 million years ago, in the first part of the Miocene, lasted until the Pleistocene. The Mátra formed 13-18 million years ago as part of a series of events that are also significant in the geological history of our European continent.

The explosive, &quot;acidic&quot; volcanism rocks known as the introductory stage of Miocene volcanism are also found here. Of the pyroclastics classified under the collective name of lower, middle and upper rhyolite tuff, the middle one was identified in the Mátra. Its local variant was called &quot;Tar dacitetuff&quot; due to its relatively lower silicon content, the exact age of which is unknown; its formation time may be between 15-18 million years. It occurs as ignimbrite deposited partly on land and partly under water up to an altitude of 500-600 meters in both the western and eastern parts. Since it is also found in relatively higher areas, it is certain that it played a fundamental role in the formation of the structure of the mountain range. The most likely scenario is that it was a series of violent and prolonged eruptions that ended with a caldera rupture. Another possibility is that the tilting of the Mátra towards the south caused the prominent geographical position of the tuff rock massif.

The &quot;andesite lava blanket&quot;, which also determines the present-day landforms of the Mátra, was formed at about the same time as the formation of the Tar dacitetuff or 1-2 million years later, during the Miocene intermediate volcanism. The formation of andesite, i.e. magma with a medium SiO2-content, can be linked to plate subduction; the high volatile content of the plate subducting from the surface flows upwards and saturates the mantle part above it. The melting point of the mantle material decreases with the process also called &quot;mantle metasomatosis&quot;, so magma can form more easily. The melt formed at this time is still basaltic in composition, but by the time it reaches the surface through complicated magma mixing and differentiation (separation) processes, it becomes increasingly andesitic in nature. Andesitic lava – compared to rhyolite-dacite – is less violent, and instead of explosive, it comes to light during effusive eruptions, which do not involve caldera formation. In such cases – as in the case of Mátra – large-area lava sheets are more typical.

With the end of andesite volcanism, diatomaceous earth (diatomite) and then limestone were deposited in the basin between Gyöngyöspata and Szurdokpüspöki, and at the end of the Miocene volcanism, some smaller rhyolite volcanoes were still active on the southern edge of the mountain range (one of the remains is the swelling cone of Kis-hegy at Gyöngyössolymos).

== Geography ==

The Mátra is part of the North Hungarian Mountains and belongs by origin to the largest young volcanic zone of Europe. It is situated between the valleys of the River Tarna and River Zagyva. The Mátra divided into the Western Mátra, Central Mátra and the Eastern Mátra. The highest point of the Western Mátra is Muzsla (805 m). The Central Mátra consists of the plateau of Mátrabérc (Mátra Ridge) and the groups of the volcanic cones of Galya-tető (964 m) and Kékes (1014 m). Steep, rugged slopes, screes, talus slopes and slides alternate with one another, covered with closed beech forests. Gentler slopes and parallel valleys flow down to the south, the largest of which is the so-called Nagy-völgy (&quot;Great valley&quot;). The &#x27;main entrance&#x27; to the Mátra was formed in parallel with the valley of Nagy-patak (&quot;Great stream&quot;), ranging from Mátrafüred to Mátraháza. From the vineyard-covered landscape of the foot of the Mátra travellers can arrive at the wooded mountains in a flash. To the east, after the steep escarpment of the 898-meter-high Sas-kő (&quot;Eagle stone&quot;), the 650–750-meter-high peaks of the Eastern Mátra follow one another. The northern part of the mountain range is called Mátralába (&quot;the Mátra&#x27;s feet&quot;). This is a hilly area covered with 250–400-meter-high small volcanic cones, with mostly cultivated arable lands.

<doc id="419642" wikidata="Q4420958" url="?curid=419642" title="Stamp numbering system">
<text>Philatelists&#x27; traditional method of identifying postage stamps uniquely has long been to number each country&#x27;s stamps consecutively; Norway #1 is the 4-skilling blue stamp issued in 1855, and so forth. However, this seemingly straightforward numbering system runs into immediate difficulties, which have been solved in different ways by different stamp catalogs.

== Issues ==

The difficulties are as follows:
* What is a &quot;country&quot;?
* What is a postage stamp?
* What is a distinct type of postage stamp?
* What if several stamps are issued on the same day?
* What if the date of issue is unknown?
* What if stamps of a single series appear one at a time, interspersed with commemorative stamps?
* Should special-purpose stamps be grouped together?

Although the definition of &quot;country&quot; may seem obvious, there are occupations of one country by another, stamp issued by areas in rebellion, reunifications, and regions that have issued their own stamps for one reason or another. A classic example is Germany: unified from many smaller entities, then divided into multiple zones of occupation at the end of World War II, then divided into West Germany and East Germany, then reunified. Catalogs typically treat West Germany as part of a single sequence under the name &quot;Germany&quot; while giving East German stamps their own numbers.

The definition of &quot;postage stamp&quot; can also be problematic for catalogers. For instance, some countries have issued adhesive labels purporting to be postage stamps, but which had the &quot;cancel&quot; printed directly on the stamp and shipped to dealers, without ever being sold to the public for use on letters. The treatment of these has long been a vexing issue, and catalogs vary greatly on whether to list the stamps. A related issue is a small number of extremely rare stamps that may or may not be old forgeries; the assignment or removal of a number is a key step in the consensus as to their authenticity.

Philatelists typically identify more types of stamps than do the governments issuing them. Changes of perforation, watermark, often occur without any official notice, as do printing errors. In a few cases, even the date of first issue of a stamp has no surviving record.

The issuance of multiple types on a single day is an old practice, but usually these were different denominations, and could be numbered in ascending order of value. More recently, it has become common to issue a group of stamps with related designs and the same denomination on the same day.

Finally, it is common for the stamps of a definitive series to be issued one or a few at a time, as postal rates change. Logically, they are part of a single group, with a unified design theme and a sequence of values, even though ten years or more may have elapsed from the first to the last. The same reasoning could be applied to special-purpose stamps such as airmail or postage due stamps.

== Catalog numbering systems ==
Over time, stamp numbers may become a shorthand for collectors and dealers. Scott Catalogue, Gibbons, Yvert and Michel catalogs all use different arrangements for numbering regular and special-purpose types, and attach different importance to variations in paper, perforation, watermark and other types.

Because of its commercial importance the publishers of the Scott Catalogue claim copyright on their numbering systems, and grant only limited licences for their use by others. The inconsistency with which Scott enforced these licences resulted in a lawsuit by Krause Publications (publishers of the Minkus Catalogue) for copyright infringement. After Krause filed a defence the suit was settled out of court, and Krause continued to reference the Scott numbers. It has been speculated that Scott was not successful. Attempts by philatelists to establish an alternative have not yet been successful.

== Official numbering systems ==

In general, governments have not tried to number their own stamps. The People&#x27;s Republic of China is a notable exception, having inscribed most of its stamps with a unique numbering system since 1949.

In 2002, as part of efforts to control allegedly illegal stamps, the Universal Postal Union introduced the WADP Numbering System (WNS) for new issues by UPU members.

<text>Alternative education encompasses educational philosophy differing from mainstream pedagogy and evidence-based education. Such alternative learning environments may be found within state, charter, and independent schools as well as home-based learning environments. Many educational alternatives emphasize small class sizes, close relationships between students and teachers and a sense of community.

The legal framework for such education varies by locality, and determines any obligation to conform with mainstream standard tests and grades.

Alternative pedagogical approaches may include different structures, as in the open classroom, different teacher-student relationships, as in the Quaker and free schools, and/or differing curricula and teaching methods, as in the Waldorf and Montessori schools. Synonyms for &quot;alternative&quot; in this context include &quot;non-traditional&quot; and &quot;non-conventional&quot;. Alternative educators use terms such as &quot;holistic&quot;.

== History ==
Alternative education grew up in response to the establishment of standardized and compulsory education over the last two to three centuries. Educators including Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Swiss humanitarian Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi; the American transcendentalists Amos Bronson Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry David Thoreau; founders of progressive education John Dewey and Francis Parker, and educational pioneers such as Friedrich Fröbel, Maria Montessori and Rudolf Steiner believed that education should cultivate the developing child on many levels: not only intellectually, but also morally and spiritually, emotionally and psychologically, and physically. After World War II an alternative Reggio Emilia approach to early-childhood education was developed in Italy, introduced by Loris Malaguzzi.

Cultural critics such as John Caldwell Holt, Paul Goodman, Frederick Mayer and George Dennison have examined education from individualist, anarchist, and libertarian perspectives. Other writers, from Paulo Freire to American educators Herbert Kohl and Jonathan Kozol, have criticized mainstream Western education from the viewpoint of liberal and radical politics. The argument for an approach catering to the interests and learning style of an individual is supported by research suggesting that a learner-responsible model is more effective than a teacher-responsible one. Ron Miller has identified five elements common to educational alternatives:
# Respect for the person
# Balance
# Decentralization of authority
# Noninterference among the political, economic, and cultural spheres of society
# A holistic worldview.

In modern times, at least in some localities, the legal right to provide educational alternatives has become established alongside a duty to provide education for school age children.

==Localities==

===Canada===
Education in Canada falls under the jurisdiction of the provincial government. Alternative education is provided in some public schools, such as Mountainview Montessori School and Trille des Bois Waldorf school in Ottawa, as well as in independent schools, such as Toronto Montessori Schools and Vancouver Waldorf School.

====Origins====
Alternative education in Canada stems from two philosophical educational points of view, Progressive and Libertarian. According to Levin, 2006 the term &quot;alternative&quot; was adopted partly to distinguish these schools from the independent, parent-student-teacher-run &quot;free&quot; schools that preceded them (and from which some of the schools actually evolved) and to emphasize the boards&#x27; commitment to options within the public school system. Progressive educational tradition places emphasis on both the need to incorporate curriculum and teaching to match the stages of child development and the gradual integration of the child into adult society through planned experiential learning. The sources of stimulus would be from the philosopher John Dewey in the United States, from post WW1 New Schools in Great Britain and the Steiner/Waldorf schools in Europe. The Libertarian tradition focuses on the rights of the parents and children to make their own educational and life choices. As noted by Levin &quot;It is rooted in the belief to uphold the individual freedom and the innate goodness of the child against institutional and social conformity and the corrupting influences of modern society.&quot;

====School types====
The 1980s saw a shift to special schools and/or programs for those students that excelled in academia, were artistically talented, or through programs linking schooling with the workplace in a co-operative venture. It might be considered as a natural evolution of education to offer options and not a regimented one size fits all approach. Most alternative high schools falling under public jurisdiction offered independent study programs, basic-skills programs, and were mini-high schools with a mixture of conventional and nonconventional courses, and schools with an arts focus. They also offered smaller classes, closer and more informal relations with teachers, and greater flexibility in course selection and timetabling. The most recent development within alternative education in Canada may be to follow the United States in their &quot;Charter School&quot; movement. In the US specific states have passed legislation permitting their departments of education or local school boards to issue &quot;charters&quot; directly to individual schools wishing to operate autonomously. Alberta is the first province that has already embraced this model.

=== India ===

Since the early 20th century, educators have discussed and implemented alternative forms of education, such as Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s Visva-Bharati University, Sri Aurobindo&#x27;s Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education, Jiddu Krishnamurti Schools. Traditional learning in India involved students living in gurukulas, where they received free food, shelter and education from a guru (&quot;teacher&quot; in Sanskrit). Progress was based on tests given by the gurus, and the system aimed to nurture students&#x27; creativity and personality development. Although mainstream education in India is based on the system introduced by Lord Macaulay, a few projects aim to rejuvenate the earlier method. Some students in these (and similar) projects conduct research in Sanskrit studies, Vedic studies, Vedic science, yoga and ayurveda. Others, after completing their education in a gurukula, enter mainstream higher education.

===Japan===
Japanese education is a nationwide, standardized system under the Ministry of Education. The only alternative options have been accredited, private schools with more freedom of curricula (including textbook choice; public schools are limited to government-approved textbooks), teaching methods and hiring guidelines. Nearly all private schools require a competitive entrance examination and charge tuition, with few scholarships available. Interest in alternative education was sparked during the 1980s by student violence and bullying, school refusal, social anxiety disorder and, in the worst cases, suicide; the desire to enable young people to keep up with a globalized economy is an additional impetus.

A free school is a non-profit group (or independent school) which specializes in the care and education of children who refuse to attend standard schools. The first democratic school was founded in 1985 as a shelter for children avoiding the school environment, and a number of other such schools have been established. In 1987 the first of seven Waldorf schools in Japan was founded, and other alternatives include a growing homeschooling movement.

In 1992 Dr Shinichiro Hori, formerly Professor of Education at Osaka City University, founded the first, Kinokuni Children&#x27;s Village in Wakayama Prefecture, of several alternative, democratic schools. In all he created six schools in Fukui prefecture, Kitakyushu, and Yamanashi prefecture. As friend and Japanese translator of A.S. Neill his work has been inspired by Summerhill School.

In 2003 Japan introduced Special Zones for Structural Reform (), based on China&#x27;s Special Economic Zone policy, which enable the opening of government-accredited schools providing alternative education. Two years later, the first such school was founded.

Despite the schools&#x27; high tuition, some parents send their children to international schools to acquire fluency in a foreign language (usually English). Although international schools are not certified by the Japanese government, many are approved by their native country (the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Korea and China) and some offer an International Baccalaureate program.

===Philippines===
===Taiwan===
Founded after the lifting of martial law in Taiwan, the () was the first alternative education school in Taiwan. It seeks to diverge from traditional Chinese education methodology and requires parents of their students to not hit or scold their children. The term &#x27;forest school&#x27; has become a generalized term used by schools with alternative education approaches. There is also the case of the Caterpillar, which – like the Forest School – is housed in an unconventional campus and follows a creative and more fluid curriculum. Both these schools charge expensive tuition fees but more personalized instruction.

There is also alternative education that caters to learners with special needs such as the Taipei County&#x27;s Seedling Elementary School, which opened in 1994. This school caters to native students, who need a different and less stressful learning environment. It integrates traditional courses with strategies that focus on enhancing the learner&#x27;s bond with nature and aboriginal culture. Another example is the so-called &quot;third-way&quot; education that serves the needs of students that are not local but also not foreign such as the Taipei American School, which provides instruction to Taiwanese students with family in the United States or those with occupations that took them, including their children, abroad.

===United Kingdom===
In 2003, there were about 70 schools in the United Kingdom offering education based on philosophies differing from that of the mainstream pedagogy, about half of which are Steiner-Waldorf schools. Summerhill School, established by A.S. Neill in 1921, was the first democratic school; most have since closed, except for Summerhill, Sands School, Hebden Bridge School and democratic schools for children and young people. Though most alternative schools were until recently all fee-paying, state-funded Free Schools were introduced in 2011, only two of which alternative education: the Steiner Academy Frome, Somerset, and the Steiner Academy Hereford.

The United Kingdom also has alternative provision schools and centres, designed to prevent exclusions from mainstream school, or improve behavioural problems so that students can re-access mainstream education. Since 1993, some of the centres have been referred to as Pupil Referral Units (PRU). These units are run by the local authority.

In recent years, in addition to Pupil Referral Units, many privately funded units (operated by businesses or charities) have set up versions of PRUs. These are known as private providers of alternative provision.

The influx of private businesses entering the sector has led to concerns being raised by Ofsted and the Department for Education in relation to so called illegal schools operating. Illegal schools refer to alternative provision centres providing students with a full time education without first registering properly as a school. Operating in this way means that providers avoid inspection by Ofsted.

===United States===
A variety of educational alternatives exist at the elementary, secondary and tertiary level in four categories: school choice, independent schools and home-based education. The U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s document &quot;State Regulation of Private Schools&quot; reports on the legal requirements that apply to K-12 private schools in each of the states, including any curriculum requirements. The report states that it is intended as a reference for public and nonpublic school officials and state policy-makers. The report confirms that similar areas of education are approached in a variety of ways. Trade schools and vocational colleges are also an alternate route to four year traditional college programs.

==== School choice ====

Public-school alternatives in the U.S. include separate schools, classes, programs and semi-autonomous &quot;schools within schools&quot;. Public school-choice options are open to all students, although some have waiting lists. Among these are charter schools, combining private initiatives and state funding, and magnet schools, which attract students to a particular program (such as the performing arts).

==== Independent schools ====
Independent, or private, schools have flexibility in staff selection and educational approach. Many are Montessori and Waldorf schools (the latter also known as Steiner schools, after their founder Rudolf Steiner). Other independent schools include democratic or free schools, such as Clonlara School, which is the oldest, continually operating K-12 alternative school in the country, the Sudbury schools, open classroom schools, those based on experiential education and schools using an international curriculum such as the International Baccalaureate and Round Square schools.

==== Homeschooling ====

Families seeking alternatives for educational, philosophical or religious reasons, or if there is no nearby educational alternative may opt for home-based education. A minor branch is unschooling, an approach based on interest rather than a curriculum. Others enroll in umbrella schools which provide a curriculum. Homeschool courses give students in-depth, personal attention in any subject with which they struggle or excel. Some homeschool families form a cooperative, where parents with expertise in a subject may teach children from a number of families while their children are taught by other parents. There is great variation amongst families who homeschool, from parents who set up in-home &quot;classrooms&quot; and hold class for a set amount of time each day, to families that focus on experiential learning opportunities.
==== Self-education ====

Self-directed inquiry is recognized at all levels of education, from the &quot;unschooling&quot; of children to the autodidacticism of adults, and may occur separately from (or with) traditional forms of education.

<doc id="419646" wikidata="Q1057095" url="?curid=419646" title="Three-Chapter Controversy">
<text>The Three-Chapter Controversy, a phase in the Chalcedonian controversy, was an attempt to reconcile the non-Chalcedonians of Syria and Egypt with Chalcedonian Christianity, following the failure of the &quot;Henotikon&quot;. The &quot;Three Chapters&quot; (, &quot;tría kephálaia&quot;) that Emperor Justinian I anathematized were: 
#The person and writings of Theodore of Mopsuestia
#Certain writings of Theodoret of Cyrus
#The letter of Ibas of Edessa to Maris

==Background==
At a very early stage of the controversy the incriminated writings themselves came to be spoken of as the &quot;Three Chapters&quot;. In consequence those who refused to anathematize these writings were said to defend the Three Chapters, and accused of professing Nestorianism; and, conversely, those who did anathematize them, were said to condemn the Three Chapters as heretical.

At the end of 543 or the beginning of 544 the Emperor Justinian I issued an edict in which the three chapters were anathematized, in hope of encouraging the Oriental Orthodox to accept the decisions of the Council of Chalcedon and the Tome of Pope Leo I, thus bringing religious harmony to the Byzantine Empire. However, Evagrius tells us that Theodorus Ascidas, the leader of the Origenists, had raised the question of the Three Chapters to divert Justinian from a persecution of his party. Liberatus adds that Theodorus Ascidas wished to take revenge on the memory of Theodore of Mopsuestia, who had written much against Origen. In his letter to Vigilius, Domitian, Bishop of Ancyra, reports the same story of intrigue.

Although Catholic canonists admit that theological errors, and in the case of Theodore very serious ones, can be found in the writings, the mistakes of Theodoret and Ibas were chiefly but not wholly due to a misunderstanding of the language of Cyril of Alexandria. However these errors do not make the decision of condemnation easy, for there were no good precedents for dealing harshly with the memory of men who had died in peace with the Church. Facundus, Bishop of Hermiane, pointed out in his &quot;Defensio trium capitulorum&quot; that Saint Cyprian had erred about the rebaptism of heretics, yet no one would dream of anathematizing him. The condemnation of the &quot;Three Chapters&quot; was demanded primarily to appease opponents of the Council of Chalcedon. Both Ibas and Theodoret had been deprived of their bishoprics by condemned heretics, and both were restored by the Council of Chalcedon upon anathematizing Nestorius.

==The subscription==

The leading Eastern bishops were coerced, after a short resistance, into subscribing. Mennas, Patriarch of Constantinople, first protested that to sign was to condemn the Council of Chalcedon, and then yielded, as he told Stephen the Roman apocrisarius (ecclesiastical diplomat) at Constantinople, that his subscription should be returned to him if the Pope disapproved of it. Stephen and Dacius, Bishop of Milan, who was then at Constantinople, broke off communion with him. Zoilus the Patriarch of Alexandria, Ephraim the Patriarch of Antioch, and Peter the Patriarch of Jerusalem, all yielded after a brief resistance. Of the other bishops those who subscribed were rewarded, those who refused were deposed or had to &quot;conceal themselves&quot;.

While the resistance of the Greek-speaking bishops collapsed, those from the Latin-speaking world, such as Dacius of Milan and Facundus, who were then at Constantinople, stood firm. Their general attitude is represented in two letters still extant. The first is from an African bishop named Pontianus, in which he entreats the emperor to withdraw the Three Chapters on the ground that their condemnation struck at the Council of Chalcedon. The other is that of the Carthaginian deacon, Ferrandus; his opinion as a most learned canonist was asked by the Roman deacons Pelagius (afterwards pope, at this time a strong defender of the Three Chapters) and Anatolius. He fastened on the epistle of Ibas – if this was received at Chalcedon, to anathematize it now was to condemn the council. An even stronger use of the benevolence of the council towards this epistle was made by Facundus at one of the conferences held by Pope Vigilius before he issued his &quot;Iudicatum&quot;. He wished it to protect the memory of Theodore of Mopsuestia because Ibas had spoken of him in terms of commendation (&quot;Cont. Moc.&quot;). When Vigilius arrived at Constantinople in January 547, Italy, Africa, Sardinia, Sicily, and the parts of Illyricum and Greece through which he journeyed were fiercely against the condemnation of the Three Chapters.

The matter was further complicated by the fact that the Latin-speaking bishops, Vigilius among them, were for the most part ignorant of Greek and therefore unable to judge the incriminated writings for themselves. Pelagius II in his third epistle to Elias, probably drawn up by the future Gregory I, ascribes all the trouble to this ignorance. This handicap should be remembered in judging the conduct of Vigilius. He came to Constantinople very resolute in his opinions, and his first step was to excommunicate Mennas, who removed Vigilius from the diptychs in turn. But he must have felt the ground was being cut from under his feet when he was supplied with translations of some of the most questionable passages from the writings of Theodore. In 548 he issued his &quot;Iudicatum&quot; in which the Three Chapters were condemned, then temporarily withdrew it when the storm it raised showed how ill-prepared the Latins were for it. He and Justinian agreed to convening a general council, in which Vigilius pledged himself to bring about the condemnation of the Three Chapters, but the emperor broke his pledge by issuing another edict condemning the Chapters. Vigilius had twice to take sanctuary, first in the Basilica of St. Peter, and then in the Church of St. Euphemia at Chalcedon, from which he issued an Encyclical letter describing the treatment he had received. An agreement was patched up and Vigilius agreed to a general council but soon withdrew his assent. Nevertheless, the council was held, and after refusing to accept the &quot;Constitutum&quot; of Vigilius, it then condemned the Three Chapters. Finally Vigilius succumbed, subscribed to the council, and was set free. But he died before reaching Italy, leaving his successor Pelagius the task of dealing with the schisms in the West.

==The schism in the West==
The bishops of Aquileia, Milan, and of the Istrian peninsula all refused to condemn the Three Chapters, arguing that to do so would be to betray Chalcedon. They in turn were anathematized by the Council. Meanwhile, since these bishops and most of their suffragans were soon to become subjects of the Lombards in 568, they would be beyond the reach of the coercion of the Byzantine Exarch at Ravenna, and able to continue their dissent.

However, the bishop of Milan renewed communion with Rome after the death of bishop Fronto around 581. As he had fled from the Lombards to refuge at Genoa, his successor, Laurence, was dependent upon the Byzantines for support. He subscribed to the condemnation.

In 568, the schismatic bishop of Aquileia had fled eight miles south to Byzantine controlled Grado. The Byzantines allowed these freedom and archbishop Elias, already called patriarch by his suffragans, built a cathedral under the patronage of St. Euphemia as an unabashed statement of his adherence to the schism since it was the church of St. Euphemia in which the sessions of the Council of Chalcedon were approved. Gregory the Great&#x27;s attempts at conciliation near the end of his pontificate, and especially through the Lombard queen, Theodelinda, began to have some effect. Thus, in 606, Elias&#x27;s successor Severus died and there were many clerics favorable to reconciliation. The Byzantines encouraged these to elect Candidianus who once elected promptly restored communion. However, certain stalwart clerics were unhappy and having fled to mainland Aquileia under Lombard protection elected a John as a rival bishop who maintained the schism. Thus, the schism deepened now along political Lombard-Roman lines. Columbanus was involved in the first attempt to resolve this division through mediation in 613. The bishop of &quot;old&quot; Aquileia formally ended the schism at the Synod of Aquileia in 698, only after the Lombards embraced Orthodoxy in the 7th century. The division of the Patriarchate of Aquileia contributed to the evolution of the Patriarch of Grado into the present Patriarch of Venice.

The churches of the Visigothic Kingdom of Spain (Reccared having converted a short time prior) never accepted the council; when news of the later Third Council of Constantinople was communicated to them by Rome it was received as the &quot;fifth&quot; ecumenical council, not the sixth. Isidore of Seville, in his &quot;Chronicle&quot; and &quot;De Viris Illustribus&quot;, judged Justinian a tyrant and persecutor of the orthodox and an admirer of heresy, contrasting him with Facundus of Hermiane and Victor of Tunnuna, who was considered a martyr.

==Its effect in the East==

For all of Justinian&#x27;s intents, this edict was of negligible effect in the East. In the decades following Justinian&#x27;s death, the local Christians were more concerned for their safety in the wars first against a resurgent Persia, then next against the Arabs, who came to permanently control the territories beyond the Taurus Mountains in the 630s. The Christians in those regions adhered to the edicts proclaimed in Constantinople and Rome, with determination held to their own Non-Chalcedonian beliefs.

<text>Widmer End is a hamlet in the parish of Hughenden, in Buckinghamshire, England.

The Village of Widmer End is situated about three miles north of High Wycombe town centre. In the last half century it has grown from a rural hamlet into a commuter suburb while still retaining much of its attractiveness.
It boasts a population of about 2000, a church, a pub now closed after 150 years (Enterprise Inns the last owners), a school, some shops, and a village hall and recreation ground. The latter two are owned by the village itself and are the centre for many sports and social activities.

Widmer End has expanded significantly over the years, particularly inside the &quot;George&#x27;s Hill triangle&quot; which adjoins Hazlemere. The centre of the old village is around a road junction overlooked by the Royal Standard public house.

A short distance to the south-west of Widmer End is the hamlet of Four Ashes, and Cryers Hill is to the west.

Author and former local girl Kitty Aldridge captures the 1960s expansion of Widmer End in her 2007 novel &quot;Cryers Hill&quot;.

The Widmer End newsletter is run by local residents to inform, entertain and promote community cohesion. Local businesses and schools are promoted and residents have the opportunity to write in, submit articles, poetry, opinion and inform other residents of local history.

<text>Willen is a district of Milton Keynes, England and is also one of the ancient villages of Buckinghamshire to have been included in the designated area of the New City in 1967. The original village is now a small but important part of the larger district that contains it and to which it gives its name. It is in the civil parish of Campbell Park.

==History==
The village was first recorded as &quot;Wilinges&quot; (12th century) and later as &quot;Wylie&quot;, &quot;Wilies&quot; (13th century); &quot;Wilne&quot;, &quot;Wylyene&quot; (14th century); and &quot;Wyllyen&quot;, &quot;Wyllyn&quot; (15th century). Willen is not recorded by name in the Domesday Survey, but it can be identified with the 4 hides 1 virgate assessed under Caldecote, part of the neighbouring parish of Moulsoe, and held under the Count of Mortain by Alvered. The name Willen is probably from Anglo-Saxon or Old English meaning (at the) &#x27;willows&#x27;, the adjacent River Ouzel meanders through land ideal for willows. In 1931 the civil parish had a population of 57. On 1 April 1934 the parish was abolished and merged with Great and Little Woolstone to form &quot;Woolstone cum Willen&quot;.

==Environment and amenities==
===Religious===
The parish church (1680), was designed by the architect and physicist Robert Hooke and is a classic of the early English Baroque period.

Further around the lake, there is a Buddhist Temple/monastery and a large stupa, the Milton Keynes Peace Pagoda built in 1980 by the monks and nuns of the Nipponzan-Myōhōji. It was the first to be built in the western hemisphere. There is a grass labyrinth nearby.

St Michael&#x27;s Priory is small Benedictine house in the village.

===Willen Hospice===
Overlooking the lake, Willen Hospice provides specialist care for people whose illness no longer responds to curative treatment (also known as specialist palliative care).

===Willen Lake===
One of the more important features of the district is a large balancing lake on the River Ouzel, designed to capture flash floods lest they cause problems down stream. The lake is split into two halves. The north lake is a wild-life sanctuary and a favourite of migrating aquatic birds, overlooked by the Peace Pagoda and the Hospice. The south lake is for leisure use, with a full watersports and boat hire centre, as well as inflatable aqua park and wakeboarding facility. There are many paths around the lake suitable for walking, running or cycling. The south lake also comprises a children&#x27;s splash park and a high ropes course, as well as playing host to various events throughout the year.

====Bird Life====
In its history, many rare and scarce migrating birds have turned up on the north side of the lake. The island is primarily for bird life. Many common bird species breed on the spit that can be viewed from the only hide on the lake, the north hide.

===Sports===
The district is also home to Willen Cricket Club and to Willen Juniors FC, who both play at Willen Fields on Portland Drive.

<text>College of the Atlantic (COA) is a private liberal arts college in Bar Harbor on Mount Desert Island, Maine. Founded in 1969, it awards bachelors and masters (M.Phil.) degrees solely in the field of human ecology, an interdisciplinary approach to learning. Focus areas include arts and design, environmental sciences, humanities, international studies, sustainable food systems, teacher certification and educational studies, and socially responsible business. The College of the Atlantic is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

The campus consists of on Frenchman Bay, two organic farms, two off-shore island research stations, and a protected area. The farms, Beech Hill Farm and Peggy Rockefeller Farms, are living laboratories for classes and student research. Peggy Rockefeller Farms includes livestock, crops, orchards. Beech Hill Farm provides produce. Both supply the dining hall with organic produce, eggs, and meat. The off-shore island properties include the Alice Eno Field Research Station on Great Duck Island where students conduct studies on Leach&#x27;s storm petrels, guillemots, gulls, sparrows and other fields of natural history. The Edward McCormick Blair Research station on Mount Desert Rock is a center for the study of marine mammals and oceanographic issues.

==History==
The College of the Atlantic was conceived by Mount Desert Island residents who wanted to stimulate the island&#x27;s economy during the off-season, when revenue from tourism declined, by forming a year-round, four-year institution of higher education.

In 1968, Father James Gower, a Catholic priest and peace activist, and his former football teammate from Bar Harbor High School, businessman Les Brewer, conceived the idea for the College of the Atlantic. Brewer and Gower founded the school in 1969, when the school of human ecology was granted temporary approval on June 23, 1969, by the Maine State Board of Education. Three other Mount Desert residents helped establish the college: Bernard K. &quot;Sonny&quot; Cough, Richard Lewis and Robert Smith. Edward Kaelber, then assistant dean at Harvard Graduate School of Education, became the first president and was joined in 1970 by Melville P. Cote as assistant to the President and Director of Admissions and Student Affairs.

Father James Gower proposed &quot;Acadia Peace College&quot; as the original name for the school, though this was rejected in favor of the College of the Atlantic. The College of the Atlantic began offering its first classes in 1972 with an enrollment of just 32 students. The institution had about 300 students for the 2012–13 school year. The College of the Atlantic offers only one academic major: human ecology. Gower helped create the curriculum for the college and its academic programs.

The majority of the campus was purchased for $1 from the Oblate Fathers of Mary Immaculate Seminary, who used the site as a monastery. Parts of the campus were also donated by the family of co-founder Bernard Cough.

==Academics==

The school&#x27;s curriculum is based on human ecology, and all first-year students are required to take an introductory course in human ecology. Other requirements include two courses in each focus area (Environmental Studies, Arts and Design, Human Studies), one quantitative reasoning course, one history course, and one course that involves extensive writing. The intention is for students to explore and integrate ideas from different disciplines and to construct their own understanding of human ecology. With its focus on interdisciplinary learning, College of the Atlantic does not have distinct departments, and all faculty members consider themselves human ecologists in addition to their formal specialization.

As a graduation requirement, all students must complete a term-long senior project and a human ecology essay in their final year, in addition to a mandatory internship sometime within their four years. For this senior project, students decide the methods and content which are then submitted for approval by their academic advisors. Projects are diverse and have included computer programs, scientific papers, ethnographic research, theatrical productions, educational curricula, novels, art exhibits, books of letters, garden renovations, and music compilations.

==Students==
With international students comprising an average of 17 percent of the student body, College of the Atlantic is among the five liberal arts colleges with the highest proportion of international students. These students primarily graduate from United World Colleges and are awarded significant scholarships through the Davis United World College Scholars Program.

==Sustainability==
In 2004, COA was the first campus to make a multi-year commitment to be powered entirely by renewable energy, signing a 10-year contract with Endless Energy Corporation. In 2005 it was the first school to hold a zero-waste graduation. In October 2006, COA pledged to become carbon neutral, offsetting all of its carbon emissions, including those created by visiting students; COA fulfilled the pledge in December 2007 by purchasing carbon offsets for their emissions through the Climate Trust of Oregon. The college currently offsets those emissions it cannot reduce or avoid via truck stop electrification through Carbonfund.org. In 2016, COA was ranked as the #1 green college by The Princeton Review.

New student housing is also touted as being some of the most sustainable in the northeast, built partially from recycled materials and featuring composting toilets, wood pellet heat, and superior insulation.

<doc id="419660" wikidata="Q13424411" url="?curid=419660" title="Star Trek Customizable Card Game">
<text>The Star Trek Customizable Card Game is an out-of-print collectible card game based on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. The name is commonly abbreviated as STCCG or ST:CCG. It was first introduced in 1994 by &quot;Decipher, Inc.&quot;, under the name Star Trek: The Next Generation Customizable Card Game. The game now has two distinct editions, though both forms of the game have many common elements.

==Standard elements==

The standard central goal for a player of &quot;STCCG&quot; is to obtain 100 points, primarily by completing &quot;missions&quot; or &quot;objectives&quot;. This is done by bringing &quot;personnel&quot;, &quot;ships&quot; and &quot;equipment&quot; into play, then moving an attempting team to a mission. Once a mission attempt starts, the personnel will create away teams to encounter &quot;dilemmas&quot; which will challenge them in some way. Often if the personnel have the required &quot;skills&quot; or &quot;attributes&quot; they can overcome certain dilemmas&#x27; effects. Once the required dilemmas are passed, the personnel still active in the attempt must have the skills and/or attribute totals required by the mission to solve it. If the mission is solved, the player earns the printed points.

Other aspects of the game increase player interactions: ships and personnel can battle, or otherwise affect each other; cards like &quot;events&quot; and &quot;interrupts&quot; can alter the environment for one or more players; and points can be scored using methods other than mission solving.

One of the most attractive themes of the game is &quot;affiliations&quot;. These are groupings of ships and personnel based on the major interstellar powers of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, and decks will be based around one, or perhaps more, of these groups.

==First Edition==
What is now known as First Edition (commonly abbreviated &quot;1E&quot; among players) is the original conception of the game, through various designers and iterations. It was first licensed only to cover &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, and the first three card sets were limited to that show&#x27;s universe. As such, the only affiliations created were the &quot;Federation&quot;, &quot;Klingons&quot;, and &quot;Romulans&quot;, plus a group for other cards that didn&#x27;t fit into the three main affiliations called &quot;Non-Aligned&quot;. This narrow scope caused little attraction for players, and it was felt that only five more sets could be released before running the full course of available material.

In 1997, Decipher announced that a wider scope had now been licensed for the game: &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, &quot;Voyager&quot; and &quot;The Next Generation&quot; movies would soon be depicted in new cards, thus the game&#x27;s name was shortened to the existing title. The &quot;First Contact&quot; set arrived late that year, based on the film &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;; that set introduced the &quot;Borg&quot; affiliation, among other new concepts.

This was soon followed by several sets based on situations in &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;; these introduced affiliations for the Bajorans, Cardassians, Dominion, and Ferengi, along with enhanced systems for battling and capturing. The era of these expansions is considered by many players to be the &#x27;golden age&#x27; of First Edition.

Two more sets featuring &quot;Original Series&quot; cards came next (when that property was added to the license), followed by sets drawing heavily on &quot;Voyager&quot; which introduced the new, but smaller Kazon, Vidiian, and Hirogen affiliations. It was after this that the game began a serious decline in popularity and sales.

Sales faltered during the release of the last two sets, based on the films and on holodeck scenarios. This dip in sales resulted in Decipher taking a serious look at the game&#x27;s future.

===Releases===
&quot;Full expansions are listed in&quot; regular type, &quot;boutique/special cards in italics&quot;

1E Premiere (release: November, 1994) The first edition premiere set contained 363 cards (121 each of rare, uncommon, and common) and introduced the affiliations of the Federation, the Klingons, and the Romulans, along with Non-Aligned cards. It was available in randomized 60-card starter boxes (generally not playable right out of the box, with 2 rares, 13 uncommons, and 45 commons) and 15-card expansion packs (1 rare, 3 uncommons, and 11 commons). The initial &#x27;limited edition&#x27; print run had a black border and the following &#x27;unlimited edition&#x27; runs (December 1994 and 1995) had a white border, making the black-bordered cards rarer, even though that color would become the staple of all later sets. In fact, all printings after the first were planned to be white-bordered, but no more printings were made. The Limited Edition print run of 45.9 million cards consisted of 19,339 of each rare card, 78,843 of each uncommon card, and 281,157 of each common card. The white-bordered edition print run was 162 million cards. Both were printed by Carta Mundi in Belgium.

Data Laughing (release: 1995) A promotional card that had ties to the first three sets. It was originally available as a mail-in redemption included in the &quot;Official Player&#x27;s Guide&quot; published by Brady Games. The card was later included in the Introductory 2-Player Game.

Warp Pack (release: August, 1995) The Warp Pack was a selection of 12 white-bordered common cards to help make decks playable out of the box. Two of the cards that had not been seen before would be released in the next set, Alternate Universe. The packs were available for free from the Decipher website.

Alternate Universe (release: December, 1995) Alternate Universe was a collection of 122 cards that focused on cards from the past, future, and alternate timelines. It also contained the first ultra-rare card, the &quot;Future Enterprise&quot;. It sold in 15-card expansion packs. The expansion marked the point where tournament play was sponsored by Decipher, Inc.

Collector&#x27;s Tin (release: November, 1995) This collector&#x27;s item had a limited run of 30000 units and contained one of each of the premiere set&#x27;s 363 cards with a silver border.

Q Continuum (release: October, 1996) The next expansion, Q Continuum was another standard set of 121 cards and introduced the Q Continuum and the &quot;Q-Flash&quot; side deck to the game. An important mechanic introduced in this expansion was the &quot;Q&#x27;s Tent&quot; sideboard.

Introductory 2-Player Game (release: January, 1997) This set contained two separate pre-constructed 60-card decks, one Federation and one Klingon, both of which are white bordered. Each edition included the same three premium cards (a black-bordered Admiral McCoy and Data Laughing and a white-bordered Spock) and 11 new white-bordered mission cards. Edition #1 (in a blue box) contained a set of three new black-bordered premium Federation cards and Edition #2 (in a red box) contained a set of three new black-bordered premium Klingon cards.

First Anthology (release: June, 1997) The First Anthology (a concept that would return twice more) included six premium cards that would all later be featured in upcoming sets and was the first to feature cards that were not exclusive to &quot;The Next Generation&quot;. The box also contained two white bordered Premiere 60-card starter sets, two 15-card packs of white-bordered Premiere, two 15-card packs each of Alternate Universe and Q Continuum, and the Warp Pack.

The Fajo Collection (release: December, 1997) This special collection contained 18 super-rare cards and had a print run of 40,000. Each set contains a presentation binder, a signed certificate of authenticity, a Fajo Collection rules document, a collectible art poster showcasing the entire &quot;Star Trek CCG&quot; universe at that time, a business card featured on one of the cards, and a stick of gum associated with another. The cards were available from a Decipher subsidiary, the Eccentric Order, and were promised not to be reprinted in order to retain their value. The collection introduced the concept of a &quot;set icon&quot; printed on every card in that set that would continue until the end of 1E. Because of the low print runs, Decipher was able to include some special features on the cards, including metallic ink, UV-light sensitive ink, better color saturation, artwork bleeding onto the card border, and even a card (Qapla&#x27;!) printed entirely in Klingon (the design for which is markedly different from every other card in the game).

First Contact (release: December, 1997) This set of 130 cards focused entirely on the movie &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;, greatly changed gameplay and added the first new affiliation in the Borg. It was available in 9-card booster packs, greatly reducing the number of repeat common cards.

Away Team Pack (release: May, 1998) This pack contains two cards featuring The Traveler (from the episode &quot;Where No One Has Gone Before&quot; and The Emissary (Benjamin Sisko&#x27;s role in the Bajoran religion). The cards were designed to honor Decipher&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek CCG&quot; product managers Marcus Certa (The Emissary) and Kyle Heuer (The Traveler), who functioned as traveling game evangelists using those pseudonyms. The packs were made available as an insert in an issue of &quot;Scrye&quot; magazine and were also handed out by the traveling evangelists themselves.

Official Tournament Sealed Deck (OTSD) (release: May, 1998) The Official Tournament Sealed Decks contain the same fixed deck of twenty new cards, designed to allow any other cards to be able to work together in a sealed format. Also included in each set were four white-bordered Premiere expansion packs and one Alternate Universe expansion pack. There were six different box designs (each representing an affiliation: Bajoran, Borg, Cardassian, Federation, Klingon, and Romulan).

Deep Space Nine (release: July, 1998) This set of 276 cards introduced the characters, aliens, and more from &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; as well as two new affiliations: the Bajorans and the Cardassians. The USS &quot;Defiant&quot; was a special &quot;twice as rare&quot; white-bordered preview card. The set was available in 60-card starter decks and 9-card expansion packs.

Starter Deck II (release: December, 1998) This set attempted to solve again the problems of playing the game straight from the box by including a 60-card Premiere starter deck along with eight new cards designed to allow the cards in the starter to work together. A collaboration with Activision included a giveaway of a Starter Deck II with the pre-order of &quot;Star Trek: Hidden Evil&quot;.

Enhanced First Contact (release: January, 1999) The &quot;Enhanced First Contact&quot; boxes consisted of four packs of the &quot;First Contact&quot; expansion packaged with three new cards and one transparent Borg assimilation overlay. There were four different assortments of the new cards, and each group of three would always occur together in the same package, along with the same transparent Borg overlay. A cutout on the back of the box allowed buyers to know which new cards they were buying.

The Dominion (release: January, 1999) This set of 130 cards introduced the Dominion affiliation. It also included four special white-bordered preview cards that would all be reprinted in subsequent expansions. It was sold in 9-card expansion packs.

Blaze of Glory (release: August, 1999) &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; was a 130-card expansion that enhanced the battling mechanic that had remained unchanged since the beginning of the game. It also featured an 18-card foil subset - the first in any &quot;Star Trek CCG&quot; expansion. It was sold in 9-card expansion packs. Many players point to this expansion as the high point of the game.

Rules of Acquisition (release: December, 1999) This 130-card set introduced the Ferengi and their rules. It was sold in 9-card expansion packs.

U.S.S. Jupiter (release: 2000) This card was inserted into the PC game &quot;Star Trek: Armada&quot; by Activision as a promotional tie-in.

Second Anthology (release: March, 2000) The &quot;Second Anthology&quot; included six premium cards that would not be featured in upcoming sets. The box also contained two Starter Deck IIs, two &quot;First Contact&quot; expansion packs, two &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; expansion packs, and two &quot;Dominion&quot; expansion packs.

The Trouble with Tribbles (release: July, 2000) This 141-card set introduces the &quot;Original Series&quot; and the &quot;tribbles&quot; side deck. The &quot;Original Series&quot; became a property of Decipher when SkyBox International lost its license and was premiered in this set. Special features include preconstructed starter decks with premium cards in each and the return of ultra-rare cards inserted into packs (there would be an ultra-rare in each expansion from that point forward). This expansion featured Dr. McCoy as its ultra-rare as a tribute to DeForest Kelley, who had died the previous year. Cards also began to list collector&#x27;s information (card number and rarity) in the lower right corner. The expansion was sold in two preconstructed 60-card starter decks (one Federation, one Klingon) and 11-card expansion packs.
Tribbles (release: October, 2000) is non-collectible customizable card game. It is a subgame of the &quot;Trouble with Tribbles&quot; expansion and was a customizable card game. While this game is not playable with most cards from the customizable card game, this pre-constructed game could be expanded by collecting the tribbles cards from &quot;The Troubles with Tribbles&quot; expansion of the Star Trek CCG.

Reflections: The First Five Year Mission (release: November, 2000) This set consisted of 18-card packs that contained 17 random cards (from Premiere, Alternative Universe, Q Continuum, &quot;First Contact&quot;, &quot;The Dominion&quot;, and &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;) and a special foil card. 105 of the best rare cards available were reproduced as foil versions; 100 were presented in the packs. Reflections also introduced &quot;topper&quot; cards. Four of these premium foil cards appeared randomly, one per display, on top of the packs inside the 30-pack display box. In addition, a case of display boxes was topped with a final Seven of Nine foil.

Enhanced Premiere (release: November, 2000) Six different &quot;Enhanced Premiere&quot; packages were available. Each contained four packs of white bordered Premiere and five new premium cards. There were a total of twenty-one new premium cards: twelve were fixed and nine were randomized. Nine were the second versions of missions that had originally appeared in the Premiere set. The cards were upgraded with new gameplay and either images of space stations found in Activision&#x27;s video game &quot;Star Trek: Armada&quot; (as another cross-promotional tie) or wormholes (to help make the &quot;Wormhole&quot; card easier to use in the sealed environment). This set also introduced the Warp Speed format for quicker games and drafting capabilities. As with Enhanced First Contact, the product boxes had a cutout on the back so buyers knew which set of fixed cards they had selected.

Mirror, Mirror (release: December, 2000) This 131-card set introduced the Mirror Universe. This expansion&#x27;s ultra-rare was Mirror Universe First Officer Spock. It was sold in 11-card expansion packs.

Voyager (release: May 23, 2001) This 201-card set introduced the Delta Quadrant faction of &quot;Voyager&quot; and her crew as well as the Kazon and Vidiian affiliations. This expansion&#x27;s ultra-rare was The Pendari Champion (a character played by Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson in a &quot;WWF Smackdown!&quot; (now &quot;WWE Smackdown!&quot;) cross-promotion). The expansion was sold in 40-card starter decks (some of which were drawn from a set of 20 starter-only cards) and 11-card expansion packs. This set also introduced the &quot;Voyager&quot;-only environment for sanctioned gameplay. Starting with this expansion, dual-affiliation cards were printed with both color borders (with equal rarity).

The Borg (release: September 19, 2001) The Borg continued the introduction of the Delta Quadrant with 131 cards that introduced the Borg again and added the Hirogen affiliation. The expansion&#x27;s ultra-rare was a &quot;Voyager&quot;-era Reginald Barclay. The expansion was sold in 11-card expansion packs.

Holodeck Adventures (release: December 21, 2001) &quot;Holodeck Adventures&quot; was a 131-card set that expanded on the holographic characters that had been available since the Premiere set. The expansion&#x27;s ultra-rare was Jean-Luc Picard as Dixon Hill. The expansion was sold in 11-card expansion packs. The name of the set was originally going to be given to the fourth full set before the original license was expanded, and the set was designed with that nostalgia in mind, as it had links to Q Continuum.

Tournament / Redemption Foils (release: January 2001 – August 2002) A set of 18 foils of popular common and uncommon cards were provided by Decipher as prizes for sanctioned tournaments. Each card was available for two months. There were also seven additional foils provided as prizes for special tournaments, as incentives for retailer promotions, or given to attendees of DecipherCon in October 2000.

The Motion Pictures (release: April 17, 2001) The 131 cards in The Motion Pictures featured all nine of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies available at the time and the &quot;Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Flashback&quot;, which ties into &quot;Star Trek VI: the Undiscovered Country&quot;. The expansion&#x27;s ultra-rare was a 24th-century James T. Kirk. The expansion was sold in 11-card expansion packs. This was also the last set released before the announcement of the end of the game and the move to 2E.

All Good Things (release: July 9, 2003) All Good Things featured 41 new cards that provided new gameplay and mended the so-called &quot;broken links&quot; in the first edition – cards that were referenced directly or indirectly on other cards but had not yet been released. The &quot;anthology-style&quot; collector&#x27;s box included ten Reflections expansion packs, a Starter Deck II, the USS &quot;Jupiter&quot; premium card, and a comprehensive card list. The name of the set comes from the last episode of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; and had been the proposed name for the fifth and final expansion before the license was expanded.

Enterprise Collection (release: July 7, 2006) With the inclusion of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; in 2E, it was felt that 1E players should be able to have the tools necessary to play as the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-era &quot;Starfleet&quot; affiliation as well. This set of 18 foiled cards (and a supply of First Edition compatible cards from 2E) was intended to make that possible. The cards were sold exclusively from Decipher&#x27;s website.

Genesis (release: November 13, 2006) &quot;Genesis&quot; was a 27-card expansion that has the distinction of being the only completely First Edition compatible set in 2E. Each card was designed to work in both versions of the game, with varying degrees of success. The cards were sold exclusively from Decipher&#x27;s website.

===Critical reception to First Edition===
In the June 1995 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 218), Rick Swan admired the high production quality of the cards, and the fact that &quot;a typical starter deck provides a good mix of all categories.&quot; Swan not only admired the streamlined game system, but also &quot;its remarkable simulation of the elements of a good SF adventure.&quot; He did question the internal logic of some of the scenarios; for example, &quot;some of the Missions must be undertaken by specific affiliations – why can&#x27;t the Federation assist with the fever outbreak on Nahmi IV and why can&#x27;t the Romulans hunt for artifacts on Barradas III?&quot; Swan also questioned the rule that opposing sides can use the same Personnel, leading to the potential situation where &quot;Lt. Worf might have to battle himself.&quot; Swan also criticized combat, which was little more than &quot;a comparison of weapons ratings and shield ratings, but not particularly dramatic.&quot; He also questioned why a ship is removed if it loses two battles in the same turn. But in the end, Swan felt these were minor quibbles, giving the game a top rating of 6 out of 6, while calling the game &quot;ingenious, gorgeous and addictive.&quot;

A year later, in the June 1996 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 230), Swan revisited the game to review the &quot;Alternate Universe&quot; expansion, and found the game &quot;remains a delight.&quot; He gave the expansion set a rating of 4 out of 6, saying, &quot;&quot;Alternate Universe&quot; doesn&#x27;t do much to expand the rules, but it serves as a good excuse to revisit a terrific product.&quot;

The reviewer from the online second volume of &quot;Pyramid&quot; stated that &quot;I hoped Decipher would continue to find new and innovative ways to release and market cards for their games. &quot;The Fajo Collection&quot; for the &quot;Star Trek Game&quot; gave me my wish.&quot;

===First edition&#x27;s problems===
Some of Decipher&#x27;s concerns included the complexity and bloat that the game had built over seven years; there was no balanced &#x27;cost&#x27; system for cards, causing stopgap and complex systems to be added to the game over time. As well, the game had embraced many different and not fully compatible ideas over time; this made for long, corrective rules documents and a steep learning curve for beginners. In addition, the number of cards types went from nine to over seventeen in just a couple of years, which made the game much more difficult to learn.

===Initial ideas===
At first, the game designers sought to introduce an entire new game based on &quot;Star Trek&quot;; it would be simpler and be targeted to beginners, while the original game still produced expansions, but on a slower schedule. This concept was abandoned when the sales figures showed that the original game could not continue on its own merits.

==Second edition==
The solution was to reinvent the original game along the basic lines, still allowing a depth of gameplay but avoiding complex rules and concepts. The standard card types and gameplay would remain, allowing some new cards to be used with the original cards, known as &quot;backward-compatible cards&quot;, or &quot;First Edition Compatible&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;1EC&quot;) and attempting to satisfy longstanding fans of the original game. These cards are able to be used in First Edition gameplay, though some key words need to be changed to fit the First Edition&#x27;s old rules and setup. Further information on how to use Second Edition cards in First Edition gameplay are listed in the First Edition Conversion Rules. Many cards central to the new form of the game can only conform to the new rules and setup. Second Edition, commonly abbreviated &quot;2E&quot;, was launched in 2002, and came to a close with its final expansion in December, 2007.

Because the game was essentially starting from scratch with the hindsight of seven years&#x27; work, the initial Second Edition set was able to progress quickly. As a result, six affiliations debuted in that set compared to three for the original. It could be argued that the number was really seven, because of a unique new system that divided the Federation affiliation into groupings based on the shows&#x27; casts. The focus of the Second Edition sets has been on characters and situations in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, though &#x27;supporting&#x27; cards have images and concepts drawn from every part of the canon &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. Furthermore, the scope of each card type could be realized in the early planning and a permanent seven card types were created: &quot;dilemmas&quot;, &quot;equipment&quot;, &quot;events&quot;, &quot;interrupts&quot;, &quot;missions&quot;, &quot;personnel&quot;, and &quot;ships&quot;. Decks would consist of five missions, at least twenty dilemmas in a dilemma pile (see below) and at least thirty-five cards made up of the other five card types.

===Cost and resources===
One major difference in Second Edition was the addition of a cost system to equipment, events, personnel, and ships. A card&#x27;s cost is listed in the top left-hand corner of a card, directly preceding the card&#x27;s title as a single digit number (currently anywhere from 0 to 9). A player receives seven &#x27;counters&#x27; at the beginning of each turn; to play a card, the player must spend a number of counters equal to the cost of the card. Only interrupts (of the card types in a player&#x27;s deck) do not have a cost and are treated as 0-cost.

===Dilemma pile===
Another major change in the gameplay of Second Edition was the new method of handling dilemmas. Instead of using First Edition&#x27;s lengthy procedure of a &#x27;seed phase&#x27;, which could last upwards of 15 minutes, Second Edition employs an &#x27;on-the-fly&#x27; method for constructing dilemma combinations. Whereas a First Edition player was constrained to using the same dilemmas in each game of a tournament, the Second Edition player has a side deck, or &#x27;dilemma pile&#x27; from which to draw a random selection of dilemmas based on the number of personnel the opponent uses in a given mission attempt. This concept is similar to First Edition&#x27;s Q-Flash side deck, and also to a rules variant of First Edition introduced by a group of players from the San Francisco area called &#x27;Trek 1.5&#x27;. This more dynamic method of selecting dilemmas is dependent on a player&#x27;s ability to remember which personnel his/her opponent has played and their ability to satisfy a dilemma&#x27;s requirements.

===Gameplay considerations===
While First Edition attempted to sometimes literally represent instances from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe in the game, Second Edition has focused more on a consistency of gameplay as a priority over design consideration with regard to remaining faithful to the source material. Effects on cards sometimes lack the &quot;Trek sense&quot; that First Edition cards contained and can be purely conceptual, but are generally much more equitable when compared with other similarly costed effects.

===Affiliation uniqueness===
The affiliations found in Second Edition all follow rules that give them focus and distinguish them from one another, unlike most of the affiliations in First Edition. Playing an affiliation in Second Edition &quot;feels&quot; more like that affiliation than First Edition, given the themes.

Bajorans are religious and think about how the past affects their lives. This gives them strengths in one of the game&#x27;s three attributes: Integrity. They can also manipulate the discard pile (conceptually, what has passed on).

Borg are half-mechanical lifeforms that use their superior numbers to overcome resistance and even make an enemy into one of their mindless number. This is represented by a number of abilities that manipulate decks and ignore or otherwise force through dilemmas. They also are very effective in taking over another player&#x27;s resources, including their personnel. They do not work with any other affiliation.

Cardassians are wasteful in their pursuits of resources and can make great use of political prisoners. This is shown in a variety of drawing mechanisms, which allow players to find cards they want faster at a cost of discarding others. Also, they are the best at holding an opponent&#x27;s personnel for gain.

The Dominion are a hierarchal society that, as the name implies, dominates other societies. They are conceived in the game as a kind of anti-Federation (see below) and often hurt all players to further their goals. Their personnel are usually Jem&#x27;Hadar, who act as shock-troopers and are treated as disposable, Vorta, who act as commanders and diplomats, and Changelings, who are the overall leaders of the Dominion, are protected at all costs, and often use their shape-shifting abilities to infiltrate an opponent&#x27;s personnel, often meddling with their progress.

The Federation focuses on cooperation and mutual advancement and work to better themselves. In gameplay, their effects often help all players, but planning for this allows a player to take a larger advantage than his or her opponent who does not have advance warning. Their personnel are often the best individuals in the game, but most effects cost a little more to achieve. Each reporting icon (see below) has other themes unique to their show.

The Ferengi are the greedy capitalist of the future, but are mostly weak in each of the attributes. This is achieved in the game by giving them bonuses in almost all areas simply by having more of some resource than an opponent. Also, they will hoard their resources by stacking cards beneath their headquarters mission, using those resources to great effect later.

Non-Aligned personnel are a catch-all affiliation for personnel that do not fit in one of the other affiliations.

Klingons are brutal, but honorable warriors. They can achieve their goals by fighting an opponent either ship to ship or personnel to personnel. The average Klingon has a high Strength, which is one of the three attributes used by the game.

Romulans prefer espionage and sneaky tactics as opposed to direct confrontation. This is realized in the game by manipulating another player&#x27;s deck, hand, and other resources. Rarely do they affect cards already in play, but they can mess with an opponent&#x27;s ongoing attempts to score points.

Starfleet is based on the pre-Federation days as depicted in &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;. The humans in this era are eager to get out into space and get bonuses for completing a space mission first. As a result, they can be slow to start, but then can easily make up time.

===Reporting icons===
One aspect of affiliation uniqueness that Second Edition has continued is specialized reporting icons. While not a new idea (First Edition&#x27;s Mirror, Mirror set first featured Empire and Alliance icons for affiliated personnel and ships), Second Edition&#x27;s widespread utilization of the icon as a cultural identifier has allowed designers to introduce support cards that better represent the various &quot;Trek&quot; shows&#x27; themes. This is the primary tool to divide the Federation affiliation into separate groups (&quot;The Original Series&quot;, &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, and &quot;Voyager&quot; each have an icon representing their personnel and ships). Other likeminded groups can have these icons as well; the Maquis incorporate members of four different affiliations into their arsenal, while the Terok Nor personnel and ships represent the brief period of Cardassian/Dominion command of Deep Space Nine.

===Releases===
1. Second Edition (release: December 12, 2002) The 2E premier was a 415-card introduction into the new mechanics of the restarted game. It introduced the affiliations of the Bajorans, Cardassians, Federation (with &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, and Earth factions), Klingons, Non-Aligned, and Romulan. The cards were sold in &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, Klingon, Romulan, and &quot;The Next Generation&quot; starter decks, which were pre-constructed to allow a player to have a playable deck right away, and in 11-card expansion packs.

2. Energize (release: May 21, 2003) &quot;Energize&quot; consisted of 180 cards intended to jumpstart the game from the premier. It introduced the Federation faction of the Maquis and expanded the core play of the game. The cards were sold in 11-card expansion packs.

3. Call to Arms (release: September 10, 2003) &quot;Call to Arms&quot; was a double-sized set at 208 cards. It introduced the affiliations of the Borg, Dominion, and the Ferengi (although the Ferengi consisted only of two cards that played with the Terok Nor faction of both the Cardassians and the Dominion; the full Ferengi affiliation would be released two years later in Strange New Worlds). The cards were sold in Borg and Dominion starter decks, which were pre-constructed to allow a player to have a playable deck right away, and in 11-card expansion packs.

4. Necessary Evil (release: March 17, 2004) &quot;Necessary Evil&quot; finally established the standard expansion size as 120 cards. Gameplay included personnel crossing affiliation lines and paying larger costs (including losing points and hurting future chances at stopping an opponent with dilemmas with a new keyword (Consume)) for bigger effects. This set also began a tradition of foiling a select eighteen rares and inserting them into one of every seven packs. The foil cards were further made important as 2004 was the 10th anniversary of &quot;Star Trek CCG&quot;, so a special Tenth Anniversary icon was added to the corner of these foils. The cards were sold in 11-card expansion packs. The set unfortunately suffered from a small print run and became a rare commodity. Efforts were made in Reflections 2.0 to offset this problem of unavailability.

0. Tenth Anniversary Collection (release: May 3, 2004) This set was a foiled promotional collection of eighteen unique ships and commanders. It was labeled with a set number of 0, which is otherwise associated with reprints of various cards with alternate images, as foils, and/or labeled with the promotion in place of the cards&#x27; otherwise descriptive, but non-gameplay related lore. The cards themselves were numbered 6 through 23, as five promotional cards had already been printed, and continued the declaration that all foils printed in 2004 would carry the Tenth Anniversary logo. This set, however, does include the last of the cards with that icon, even though Reflections 2.0 also had foil cards in 2004. The collection itself was later reprinted without the Tenth Anniversary logo and numbered 54 through 71. The cards were originally given away with a recommended $3.00 purchase of other &quot;Star Trek CCG&quot; products, one pair at a time, over a period of nine weeks. The reprints were available for purchase on the Decipher website.

5. Fractured Time (release: October 13, 2004) &quot;Fractured Time&quot; was a 40-card boutique product that introduced events that had an effect over time by use of a new keyword (Decay) and concepts involving alternate timelines, which the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe has often called upon, including the first cards from the &quot;Mirror Universe&quot; that would eventually be revisited in three years with In a &quot;Mirror, Darkly&quot;. The cards were sold as a complete set in boxes, complete with the icons of six different affiliations, designed to carry decks. The boxes also included a starter deck and some expansion packs from previous releases with the expectation that the game could be played right out of the box in a sealed tournament format.

6. Reflections 2.0 (release: December 8, 2004) &quot;Reflections 2.0&quot; introduced 61 new foil cards to the game and 60 foil reprinted cards from 2E Premier, Energize, Call to Arms, and most importantly, Necessary Evil. The set featured cards that attempted to entice affiliations to try different missions, as mission selection among top decks had become fairly static. The cards were sold in 20-card expansion packs, which included two of the foiled cards and eighteen random cards from past expansions, including Necessary Evil.

7. Strange New Worlds (release: May 13, 2005) &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot; continued the standard expansion size of 120 cards. It introduced the full affiliation of the Ferengi. Gameplay included a personnel for each affiliation that further took advantage of alternate mission selection, like the personnel in Reflections 2.0. This set&#x27;s eighteen-card foiled subset was the first to be called an archive foil subset and was numbered separately. In addition, two archive portrait cards were put in one out of every eighteen packs, featuring a larger picture area and restricted gameplay for upcoming cards. The archive foils in this expansion featured two female characters that male fans had historically liked: Seven of Nine (previewing the upcoming &quot;Voyager&quot; faction of the Federation) and T&#x27;Pol (previewing the upcoming Starfleet affiliation). The cards were sold in 11-card expansion packs. The set unfortunately suffered a stalled release date.

&#x27;Adversaries Anthology&#x27; (release: ??, 2005) The &quot;Adversaries Anthology&quot; was a collection of eighteen of the most popular &quot;Star Trek&quot; problems, enemies, and their ships in the game reprinted as foils. The archive foils in this set featured two movie villains: the Borg Queen and Shinzon. The cards were sold in a large card storage box.

8. To Boldly Go (release: August 18, 2006) &quot;To Boldly Go&quot; was another full 120-card expansion. It introduced the affiliation of Starfleet, the pre-Federation crew from &quot;Enterprise&quot; as the last full affiliation to be introduced in the game. Gameplay included affiliation-specific dilemmas and reusable events utilizing a new keyword (Replicate). The archive foils in this set featured two show captains: James T. Kirk (previewing the upcoming &quot;Original Series&quot; faction of the Federation) and Kathryn Janeway (previewing the upcoming &quot;Voyager&quot; faction of the Federation) . The cards were sold in 11-card expansion packs.

9. Dangerous Missions (release: September 1, 2006) &quot;Dangerous Missions&quot; was another attempt at making the &quot;Star Trek CCG&quot; draftable. In other words, players could make decks within a small pool of sealed cards and play. New rules were developed to make the game slightly smaller in scope to adjust for limited resources, including the allowance of a secondary affiliation that would supplement the one sponsored by the product. This draft method remains a sanctioned format. The set consists of nineteen cards broken up into three different boxes, each focusing on an episode or movie for featured personnel, ships, and missions. They also included one unique dilemma and one shared by all three boxes. The boxes also contained Reflections 2.0 packs and three packs from expansions.

10. Captain&#x27;s Log (release: October 27, 2006) &quot;Captain&#x27;s Log&quot; was another full 120-card expansion. It introduced the Federation faction of &quot;Voyager&quot;, which began with a unique ability to have an all-space deck. Gameplay included strategies based on having the right commander aboard his or her ship and following the opponent around. The archive foils in this set harkened back to the original archive foils. The cards were sold in 11-card expansion packs.

11. Genesis (release: November 13, 2006) &quot;Genesis&quot; was a 27-card expansion that has the distinction of being the only completely First Edition compatible set in 2E. Each card was designed to work in both versions of the game, with varying degrees of success and introduced the first &quot;Original Series&quot; personnel and the ability to have an all-planet deck. The cards were sold exclusively from Decipher&#x27;s website.

12. These Are The Voyages (release: March 13, 2007) &quot;These Are the Voyages&quot; was another full 120-card expansion. It introduced the Federation faction of &quot;The Original Series&quot;. Gameplay included the new faction&#x27;s ability to upgrade by paying more for enhanced abilities, dilemmas based entirely on &quot;The Original Series&quot; (specifically the slide show images at the end of the classic episodes), and new strategies with &quot;The Original Series&#x27; &quot;main enemies: the Klingons and the Romulans. The cards were sold in 11-card expansion packs.

13. In A Mirror, Darkly (release: June 25, 2007) &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot; was another full 120-card expansion. Gameplay included cards named after each of the previous releases, more Mirror Universe content, and alternate versions of other personnel who had not been featured in the Mirror Universe, including a battleship version of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; crew from &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Enterprise&quot; and a historically inaccurate &quot;Voyager&quot; crew from &quot;Living Witness&quot;. The cards were sold in 11-card expansion packs.

14. What You Leave Behind (release: December 14, 2007) &quot;What You Leave Behind&quot; was the last full 120-card expansion. Gameplay included finishing some incomplete themes in the game so far, bonuses for attempting harder missions, and multiple versions of ships telling the story of those ships being commandeered. The cards were sold in 11-card expansion packs. The name of the set itself comes from the last episode of &quot;Deep Space Nine.&quot; This set was sold exclusively through Hill&#x27;s Wholesale Gaming.

==The Continuing Committee==
On December 5, 2007, &quot;Decipher&quot; announced that it would no longer be releasing new sets or officially supporting the game. Decipher have also since removed all Star Trek-related content from their website. A group of players came together and began work on &quot;The Continuing Committee&quot; (TCC). The name itself comes from the Romulan Continuing Committee, introduced in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, as the name was appropriate for the non-profit work being proposed. Since then, most of the game&#x27;s faithful community has moved its activities to the new site and work has gone into producing &quot;virtual sets&quot; of cards to provide continuous new blood to the game. These activities are not unprecedented, as another Decipher game, the &quot;Star Wars Customizable Card Game&quot; had ended its run in January 2002 and had established its own players&#x27; committee to deal with the same type of issues. While the &quot;Star Wars Players&#x27; Committee&quot; was introduced by Decipher, the Continuing Committee was not. However, the CEO of Decipher endorsed the &quot;Star Trek&quot; game, saying &quot;We think it&#x27;s great that enthusiastic players continue to play the game&quot;.

<text>Wingrave is a village in Buckinghamshire, England, about four miles northeast of Aylesbury and three miles southwest of Wing.

The civil parish is called Wingrave with Rowsham within Buckinghamshire district and incorporates the hamlet of Rowsham.

Wingrave is twinned with La Bouëxière in France.

== Etymology ==
Its name occurs in the Domesday Book as &quot;Withungrave&quot; and in 1163 as &quot;Wiungraua&quot;. It comes from Old English &quot;Wiwinga grāf&quot; or &quot;Wēoinga grāf&quot; = &quot;the grove of the people referred to by Wing, Buckinghamshire&quot; or &quot;the grove of the people of the heathen temple&quot;.

== Architecture ==
Around the recreation ground and in other parts of the village are many houses and cottages of varying sizes, constructed in Tudor Revival style, erected by Hannah de Rothschild in the 19th century. These houses, which display her personal cypher &#x27;H de R&#x27; were homes for estate employees. They remained part of the Mentmore Estate until well into the 20th century and are very sought after today, commanding a very high price.

The old village school was also funded by Hannah De Rothschild and was opened by William Gladstone, the prime minister of the day. It remained as the village school until just before the Second World War, when it closed when a new larger school was built. It was then used as the village hall until 1976, when it was converted into two fantastic houses extremely sought after for its historic features and history.

=== Lordship of Burbage in the Parish of Wingrave Buckinghamshire ===
The Manor of Burbage lies within the Parish of Wingrave, Buckinghamshire. First referred to by name in or about 1465, by Sir Edmund Hampden and called Edmunds Manor. William Hampden was holding Burbage Manor (the first naming as such) at his death in 1525 and the Manor was then passed to his son John Hampden in 1533. The Manor is now, roughly in what is the major part of the Parish of Wingrave Buckinghamshire. The last active Lord of the Manor was Roland William Raven, OBE, FRCS, who on his death passed the estate to his wife Dame Kathleen Raven, the Manor was then passed into the hands of the Royal College of Surgeons. The estate eventually sold off all the land and tangible assets leaving the Title and the remaining Manorial Rights which eventually were passed on to the present holder. This is a Feudal Manorial Lordship, or Honour or Dignity, rather than a Peerage. The present holder of the Lordship is Anthony Mealing a Consultant Conservation Architect from High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire.

One interesting fact, the Lord of the Manor of Burbage did until at least the Second World War, require the holder (tenant or freeholder) of the Manor Farm (the three acre fields) to have the Parish Church Floor strewn with fresh cut grass on the first Sunday after St Peter&#x27;s day (29 June) this custom survived from the 12th century up to the out break of the Second World War.
The Lord of the Manor can still call a Court Leet, these generally had a jury formed from the freehold tenants or freemen of the Manor. The jury&#x27;s role was similar to that of the doomsmen of the Anglo-Saxon period and included electing the officers (other than the Steward who was appointed by the lord), to bring matters to the attention of the court and deciding on them. 
The Officers of Courts Leet could include some or all of the following: 
* Steward, the chief official of the Lord of the Manor and judge.
* Manor Bailiff, summonsed the Jury and, if necessary, performed arrests, as well as generally supervising court matters. 
* Constable (Tithingman), to ensure law and order during court sessions. 
* Ale taster, to ensure the quality of ale, and to check that true measures are used within the Manor. 
* Carniters or &quot;flesh tasters&quot;, to ensure the freshness of meat and poultry sold within the Manor. 
* Bread Weighers, responsible for verifying the freshness and weight of bread sold in the Manor. 
* Affeerers, responsible for assessing amercements (setting the level of fines) 
* Searcher and Sealer of Leather, to ensure the quality of leather goods sold within the Manor. 
* The Hayward, responsible for enclosures and fences on common land within the Manor. 
* Surveyor of the Highways or Overseer of Pavements, and Brook Looker, to ensure the proper condition of roads and waterways within the Manor
* Manor Mace Bearer 
* Manor Town Crier.
At present all these posts are vacant.

Wingrave Manor (the building), also known as the &#x27;Old Manor House&#x27; is a Victorian half timbered pastiche of nearby Ascott House. Like many of the village&#x27;s cottages it too was built by Hannah de Rothschild in 1876. Why she built a large house barely two miles from her own home Mentmore Towers (one of the largest mansions in Buckinghamshire) can only be the subject of conjecture. The design of the house while similar to Ascott, does not have the same lightness of touch as Ascott, so is unlikely to have been designed by Ascott&#x27;s architect George Devey. The Rothschild family do not appear to have ever lived at Wingrave, as the house was soon let to the Stewart-Freeman Family who enlarged it in 1885 and eventually purchased it in 1898.

== Czech connection ==
It was the last Stewart-Freeman daughter, Mary Eveline, Countess of Essex (divorced wife of the Earl of Essex), who leased Wingrave Manor, to the exiled Czechoslovak government. They leased it for £20 a week as a residence for the employees and families of the Private Office of President Beneš (called the Chancellery or the Cabinet). It was used as a safe house and a guest-house for people visiting President Beneš. Amongst the guests were Jan Masaryk and sometimes Winston Churchill. During this time the President Dr. Edvard Beneš lived at The Abbey in nearby Aston Abbotts, and the staff of his Military Intelligence of the exiled government lived at Addington House in nearby Addington, near Winslow. Meanwhile, the offices of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile were at various locations in London.

President Beneš donated a bus shelter to the villages of Aston Abbotts and Wingrave in 1944. This is on the A418 between the two villages. Following the departure of President Beneš&#x27;s officials in 1945, the Manor was leased to an order of nuns who cared for disabled children on the site for over twenty-five years.

On 20 October 1998 President Václav Havel, the first post-communist President of the Czech Republic, visited Wingrave as part of his state visit, to mark its Czech connections. He donated visited the parish church, laid a wreath at the war memorial, signed the visitor&#x27;s book, donated a bench to the village green and had a drink with locals in the Rose and Crown pub

==Wingrave C of E Combined School==
Wingrave C of E Combined school is the only primary school in the village, and takes children from Wingrave, Cublington, Rowsham and Aston Abbotts. The current site was built in 1974, after the old schools at Wingrave and Aston Abbotts closed. It teaches around 215 pupils from the ages of 4 to 11. The current acting Headteacher is Mr M Tomson. The primary school has very close links to the church. Every year the school travels to the Parish Church for a Harvest festival and other services. Then at the age of 11, the pupils move to either Cottesloe School in Wing or a selective school in Aylesbury.

== MacIntyre School ==
In 1972 the Manor was sold to become MacIntyre School. MacIntyre school subsequently moved to a new purpose built premises in 2006 approximately 100 metres from the Manor House having sold off the manor house for development. The school cares for children described as having complex learning difficulties, many on the autism spectrum, and was greatly supported by Bob Monkhouse during his lifetime. The school offers residential and day placements.

== Churches ==
Wingrave has a parish Church of St Peter and St Paul, where Revd Howard Robson is Vicar. Wingrave also has a Methodist church at Nup End. The former URC Church closed in 2005, although the Congregational churchyard remains as a memorial garden.

== Notable people ==
Ian Dury lived in an old vicarage in Wingrave from the early 1970s. It is claimed his wife Betty gave birth to their second child, Baxter, here in 1971 whilst Ian and his band rehearsed in the front room.

<text>Physical Review is a peer-reviewed scientific journal established in 1893 by Edward Nichols. It publishes original research as well as scientific and literature reviews on all aspects of physics. It is published by the American Physical Society (APS). The journal is in its third series, and is split in several sub-journals each covering a particular field of physics. It has a sister journal, &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot;, which publishes shorter articles of broader interest.

== History ==
&quot;Physical Review&quot; commenced publication in July 1893, organized by Cornell University professor Edward Nichols and helped by the new president of Cornell, J. Gould Schurman. The journal was managed and edited at Cornell in upstate New York from 1893 to 1913 by Nichols, Ernest Merritt, and Frederick Bedell. The 33 volumes published during this time constitute &quot;Physical Review Series I&quot;.

The American Physical Society (APS), founded in 1899, took over its publication in 1913 and started &quot;Physical Review Series II&quot;. The journal remained at Cornell under editor-in-chief G. S. Fulcher from 1913 to 1926, before relocating to the location of editor John Torrence Tate, Sr. at the University of Minnesota. In 1929, the APS started publishing &quot;Reviews of Modern Physics&quot;, a venue for longer review articles. In 1932, the newly formed American Institute of Physics took over publication of &quot;Physical Review&quot;.

During the Great Depression, wealthy scientist Alfred Loomis anonymously paid the journal&#x27;s fees for authors who could not afford them.

After Tate&#x27;s death in 1950, the journals were managed on an interim basis still in Minnesota by E. L. Hill and J. William Buchta until Samuel Goudsmit and Simon Pasternack were appointed and the editorial office moved to Brookhaven National Laboratory on Eastern Long Island, New York. In July 1958, the sister journal &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot; was introduced to publish short articles of particularly broad interest, initially edited by George L. Trigg, who remained as editor until 1988.

In 1970, &quot;Physical Review&quot; split into sub-journals &quot;Physical Review A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot;. A fifth member of the family, &quot;Physical Review E&quot;, was introduced in 1993 to a large part to accommodate the huge amount of new research in nonlinear dynamics. Combined, these constitute &quot;Physical Review Series III&quot;.

The editorial office moved in 1980 to its present location across the expressway from Brookhaven National Laboratory. Goudsmit retired in 1974 and Pasternack in the mid-1970s. Past Editors in Chief include David Lazarus (1980–1990; University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign), Benjamin Bederson (1990–1996; New York University), Martin Blume (1996–2007; Brookhaven National Laboratory), and Gene Sprouse (2007–2015; SUNY Stony Brook). The current Editor in Chief is Michael Thoennessen, whose term began in September 2017.

To celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the journal, a memoir was published jointly by the APS and AIP.

In 1998, the first issue of &quot;Physical Review Special Topics: Accelerators and Beams&quot; was published, and in 2005, &quot;Physical Review Special Topics: Physics Education Research&quot; was launched. In January 2016 the names of both journals were changed to remove &quot;Special Topics&quot;. &quot;Physical Review&quot; also started an online magazine, &quot;Physical Review Focus&quot;, in 1998 to explain and provide historical context for selected articles from &quot;Physical Review&quot; and &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot;. This was merged into &quot;Physics&quot; in 2011. The Special Topics journals are open access; &quot;Physics Education Research&quot; requires page charges from the authors, but &quot;Accelerators and Beams&quot; does not. Though not fully open access, &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot; also requires an author page charge, although this is voluntary. The other journals require such a charge only if manuscripts are not prepared in one of the preferred formats. Since 2011, authors can pay an article processing charge to make their papers open access. Such papers are published under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License (CC-BY). &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot; celebrated their 50th birthday in 2008. The APS has a copyright policy to permit the author to reuse parts of the published article in a derivative or new work, including on Wikipedia.

The APS has an online publication entitled &quot;Physics&quot;, aiming to help physicists and physics students to learn about new developments outside of their own subfield. This now includes the general-interest articles that appeared as &quot;Physical Review Focus&quot;. A short-lived journal, also called &quot;Physics&quot;, was published by Pergamon Press and Physics Publishing Co. from 1964 through 1968, with the goal of printing &quot;a selection of papers which are worth the attention of all physicists.&quot; The four volumes of this journal were eventually made freely available online by the APS under the alternative title &quot;Physics Physique Физика&quot;, reflecting how the title was originally printed on the journal covers and how it was sometimes referred to in the years since.

It also publishes &quot;Physical Review X&quot;, an online-only open access journal. It is a peer-reviewed journal that publishes, as timely as possible, original research papers from all areas of pure, applied, and interdisciplinary physics. In 2014 &quot;Physical Review Applied&quot; began publishing research across all aspects of experimental and theoretical applications of physics, including their interactions with other sciences, engineering, and industry. In 2016 the APS launched &quot;Physical Review Fluids&quot; &quot;to include additional areas of fluid dynamics research&quot;, and in 2017 it launched &quot;Physical Review Materials&quot; &quot;to fill a gap&quot; in the coverage of materials research. In 2019 &quot;Physical Review Research&quot; was launched to provide a broad fully open-access journal at about the same selectivity level as the older &quot;A&quot;–&quot;E&quot; journals. In 2020, &quot;PRX Quantum&quot; was launched to provide a home for and connection between the numerous research communities that make up quantum information science and technology, spanning from pure science to engineering to computer science and beyond. In 2023 &quot;PRX Life&quot; was launched to advance research from the interdisciplinary communities at the interface of the physical and life sciences.

<text>Denys Hay (29 August 1915 – 14 June 1994) was a British historian specialising in medieval and Renaissance Europe, and notable for demonstrating the influence of Italy on events in the rest of the continent.

==Life==
He was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne on 29 August 1915 the son of Rev W. K. Hay and his wife, Janet Waugh. He was educated at the Newcastle Royal Grammar School then won a place at Oxford University.

During the Second World War, he served from 1940 in the RASC, and was then seconded to the Cabinet Office as one of the team of war historians set up at the instigation of Winston Churchill. With MM Postan and JD Scott, he contributed to the volume on The Design and Development of Weapons (HMSO 1964).

He lectured in Modern History at the University of Edinburgh from 1946 until 1954, then becoming Professor of Medieval and Renaissance History until he retired in 1980. He was also Vice-Principal of the university from 1971 - 75. He is remembered with the &quot;Denys Hay Seminar&quot; there. On retirement, he was visiting professor at the University of Virginia, and then Professor of History at the European University Institute in Florence. He was Editor of the English Historical Review from 1959 - 1967, President of the Historical Association from 1967 - 70, President of the Ecclesiastical History Society (1979–80).

He was the general editor for the &quot;Longman History of Italy&quot;, as well as the distinguished series &quot;A General History of Europe&quot; also published by Longman.

He died in Edinburgh on 14 June 1994.

==Family==
In 1937, he married Sarah Gwyneth Morley. They had one son and two daughters.

<doc id="419667" wikidata="Q2335090" url="?curid=419667" title="Missile guidance">
<text>Missile guidance refers to a variety of methods of guiding a missile or a guided bomb to its intended target. The missile&#x27;s target accuracy is a critical factor for its effectiveness. Guidance systems improve missile accuracy by improving its Probability of Guidance (Pg).

These guidance technologies can generally be divided up into a number of categories, with the broadest categories being &quot;active&quot;, &quot;passive&quot;, and &quot;preset&quot; guidance. Missiles and guided bombs generally use similar types of guidance system, the difference between the two being that missiles are powered by an onboard engine, whereas guided bombs rely on the speed and height of the launch aircraft for propulsion.

==History==
The concept of unmanned guidance originated at least as early as World War I, with the idea of remotely guiding an airplane bomb onto a target, such as the systems developed for the first powered drones by Archibald Low (the father of radio guidance).

In World War II, guided missiles were first developed, as part of the German V-weapons program. Project Pigeon was American behaviorist B.F. Skinner&#x27;s attempt to develop a pigeon-guided bomb.

The first U.S. ballistic missile with a highly accurate inertial guidance system was the short-range PGM-11 Redstone.

==Categories of guidance systems==

Guidance systems are divided into different categories according to whether they are designed to attack fixed or moving targets. The weapons can be divided into two broad categories: &quot;Go-onto-target&quot; (GOT) and &quot;go-onto-location-in-space&quot; (GOLIS) guidance systems. A GOT missile can target either a moving or fixed target, whereas a GOLIS weapon is limited to a stationary or near-stationary target. The trajectory that a missile takes while attacking a moving target is dependent upon the movement of the target. A moving target can be an immediate threat to the missile launcher. The target must be promptly eliminated in order to preserve the launcher. In GOLIS systems, the problem is simpler because the target is not moving.

==GOT systems==

In every go-onto-target system there are three subsystems:
:* Target tracker
:* Missile tracker
:* Guidance computer

The way these three subsystems are distributed between the missile and the launcher result in two different categories:
:* &quot;Remote control guidance&quot;: The guidance computer is on the launcher. The target tracker is also placed on the launching platform.
:* &quot;Homing guidance&quot;: The guidance computers are in the missile and in the target tracker.

===Remote control guidance===
These guidance systems usually need the use of radars and a radio or wired link between the control point and the missile; in other words, the trajectory is controlled with the information transmitted via radio or wire (see Wire-guided missile). These systems include:
:* &quot;Command guidance&quot; – The missile tracker is on the launching platform. These missiles are fully controlled by the launching platform that sends all control orders to the missile. The two variants are
::* &quot;Command to line-of-sight&quot; (CLOS)
::* &quot;Command off line-of-sight&quot; (COLOS)
:* &quot;Line-of-sight beam riding guidance&quot; (LOSBR) – The target tracker is on board the missile. The missile already has some orientation capability meant for flying inside the beam that the launching platform is using to illuminate the target. It can be manual or automatic.

====Command to line-of-sight====
The CLOS system uses only the angular coordinates between the missile and the target to ensure the collision. The missile is made to be in the line of sight between the launcher and the target (LOS), and any deviation of the missile from this line is corrected. Since so many types of missile use this guidance system, they are usually subdivided into four groups: A particular type of command guidance and navigation where the missile is always commanded to lie on the line of sight (LOS) between the tracking unit and the aircraft is known as command to line of sight (CLOS) or three-point guidance. That is, the missile is controlled to stay as close as possible on the LOS to the target after missile capture is used to transmit guidance signals from a ground controller to the missile. More specifically, if the beam acceleration is taken into account and added to the nominal acceleration generated by the beam-rider equations, then CLOS guidance results. Thus, the beam rider acceleration command is modified to include an extra term. The beam-riding performance described above can thus be significantly improved by taking the beam motion into account. CLOS guidance is used mostly in shortrange air defense and antitank systems.

=====Manual command to line-of-sight=====

Both target tracking and missile tracking and control are performed manually. The operator watches the missile flight, and uses a signaling system to command the missile back into the straight line between operator and target (the &quot;line of sight&quot;). This is typically useful only for slower targets, where significant &quot;lead&quot; is not required. MCLOS is a subtype of command guided systems. In the case of glide bombs or missiles against ships or the supersonic Wasserfall against slow-moving B-17 Flying Fortress bombers this system worked, but as speeds increased MCLOS was quickly rendered useless for most roles.

=====Semi-manual command to line-of-sight=====
Target tracking is automatic, while missile tracking and control is manual.

=====Semi-automatic command to line-of-sight=====

Target tracking is manual, but missile tracking and control is automatic. It is similar to MCLOS but some automatic systems position the missile in the line of sight while the operator simply tracks the target. SACLOS has the advantage of allowing the missile to start in a position invisible to the user, as well as generally being considerably easier to operate. It is the most common form of guidance against ground targets such as tanks and bunkers.

=====Automatic command to line-of-sight=====
Target tracking, missile tracking and control are automatic.

====Command off line-of-sight====
This guidance system was one of the first to be used and still is in service, mainly in anti-aircraft missiles. In this system, the target tracker and the missile tracker can be oriented in different directions. The guidance system ensures the interception of the target by the missile by locating both in space. This means that they will not rely on the angular coordinates like in CLOS systems. They will need another coordinate which is distance. To make it possible, both target and missile trackers have to be active. They are always automatic and the radar has been used as the only sensor in these systems. The SM-2MR Standard is inertially guided during its mid-course phase, but it is assisted by a COLOS system via radar link provided by the AN/SPY-1 radar installed in the launching platform.

====Line-of-sight beam riding guidance====
LOSBR uses a &quot;beam&quot; of some sort, typically radio, radar or laser, which is pointed at the target and detectors on the rear of the missile keep it centered in the beam. Beam riding systems are often SACLOS, but do not have to be; in other systems the beam is part of an automated radar tracking system. A case in point is the later versions of the RIM-8 Talos missile as used in Vietnam – the radar beam was used to take the missile on a high arcing flight and then gradually brought down in the vertical plane of the target aircraft, the more accurate SARH homing being used at the last moment for the actual strike. This gave the enemy pilot the least possible warning that his aircraft was being illuminated by missile guidance radar, as opposed to search radar. This is an important distinction, as the nature of the signal differs, and is used as a cue for evasive action.

LOSBR suffers from the inherent weakness of inaccuracy with increasing range as the beam spreads out. Laser beam riders are more accurate in this regard, but they are all short-range, and even the laser can be degraded by bad weather. On the other hand, SARH becomes more accurate with decreasing distance to the target, so the two systems are complementary.

===Homing guidance===
==== Proportional navigation ====

Proportional navigation (also known as &quot;PN&quot; or &quot;Pro-Nav&quot;) is a guidance principle (analogous to proportional control) used in some form or another by most homing air target missiles. It is based on the fact that two objects are on a collision course when the direction of their direct line-of-sight does not change. PN dictates that the missile velocity vector should rotate at a rate proportional to the rotation rate of the line of sight (line-Of-sight rate or LOS-rate) and in the same direction.

==== Radar homing ====
=====Active homing=====

Active homing uses a radar system on the missile to provide a guidance signal. Typically, electronics in the missile keep the radar pointed directly at the target, and the missile then looks at this &quot;angle&quot; of its own centerline to guide itself. Radar resolution is based on the size of the antenna, so in a smaller missile these systems are useful for attacking only large targets, ships or large bombers for instance. Active radar systems remain in widespread use in anti-shipping missiles, and in &quot;fire-and-forget&quot; air-to-air missile systems such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM and R-77.

=====Semi-active homing=====

Semi-active homing systems combine a passive radar receiver on the missile with a separate targeting radar that &quot;illuminates&quot; the target. Since the missile is typically being launched after the target was detected using a powerful radar system, it makes sense to use that same radar system to track the target, thereby avoiding problems with resolution or power, and reducing the weight of the missile. Semi-active radar homing (SARH) is by far the most common &quot;all weather&quot; guidance solution for anti-aircraft systems, both ground- and air-launched.

It has the disadvantage for air-launched systems that the launch aircraft must keep moving towards the target in order to maintain radar and guidance lock. This has the potential to bring the aircraft within range of shorter-ranged IR-guided (infrared-guided) missile systems. It is an important consideration now that &quot;all aspect&quot; IR missiles are capable of &quot;kills&quot; from head on, something which did not prevail in the early days of guided missiles. For ships and mobile or fixed ground-based systems, this is irrelevant as the speed (and often size) of the launch platform precludes &quot;running away&quot; from the target or opening the range so as to make the enemy attack fail.

SALH is similar to SARH but uses a laser as a signal. Another difference is that most laser-guided weapons employ turret-mounted laser designators which increase the launching aircraft&#x27;s ability to maneuver after launch. How much maneuvering can be done by the guiding aircraft depends on the turret field of view and the system&#x27;s ability to maintain a lock-on while maneuvering. As most air-launched, laser-guided munitions are employed against surface targets the designator providing the guidance to the missile need not be the launching aircraft; designation can be provided by another aircraft or by a completely separate source (frequently troops on the ground equipped with the appropriate laser designator).

====Passive homing====

Infrared homing is a passive system that homes in on the heat generated by the target. Typically used in the anti-aircraft role to track the heat of jet engines, it has also been used in the anti-vehicle role with some success. This means of guidance is sometimes also referred to as &quot;heat seeking&quot;.

Contrast seekers use a video camera, typically black and white, to image a field of view in front of the missile, which is presented to the operator. When launched, the electronics in the missile look for the spot on the image where the contrast changes the fastest, both vertically and horizontally, and then attempts to keep that spot at a constant location in its view. Contrast seekers have been used for air-to-ground missiles, including the AGM-65 Maverick, because most ground targets can be distinguished only by visual means. However they rely on there being strong contrast changes to track, and even traditional camouflage can render them unable to &quot;lock on&quot;.

====Retransmission homing====

Retransmission homing, also called &quot;track-via-missile&quot; or &quot;TVM&quot;, is a hybrid between command guidance, semi-active radar homing and active radar homing. The missile picks up radiation broadcast by the tracking radar which bounces off the target and relays it to the tracking station, which relays commands back to the missile.

====AI guidance====
In 2017, Russian weapons manufacturer Tactical Missiles Corporation announced that it was developing missiles that would use artificial intelligence to choose their own targets. In 2019, the United States Army announced it was developing a similar technology. Tonbo Imaging, an Indian firm, incorporated edge AI image processing and target identification into MPATGM guidance package in 2021.

==GOLIS systems==

Whatever the mechanism used in a go-onto-location-in-space guidance system is, it must contain preset information about the target. These systems&#x27; main characteristic is the lack of a target tracker. The guidance computer and the missile tracker are located in the missile. The lack of target tracking in GOLIS necessarily implies navigational guidance.

Navigational guidance is any type of guidance executed by a system without a target tracker. The other two units are on board the missile. These systems are also known as self-contained guidance systems; however, they are not always entirely autonomous due to the missile trackers used. They are subdivided by their missile tracker&#x27;s function as follows:

:* Entirely autonomous – Systems where the missile tracker does not depend on any external navigation source, and can be divided into:
::* Inertial guidance
:::* With a gimballed gyrostabilized platform or fluid-suspended gyrostabilized platform 
:::* With strapdown inertial guidance
::* Preset guidance

:* Dependent on natural sources – Navigational guidance systems where the missile tracker depends on a natural external source:
::* Celestial guidance
::* Astro-inertial guidance
::* Terrestrial guidance
:::* Topographic reconnaissance (Ex: TERCOM)
:::* Photographic reconnaissance (Ex: DSMAC)
::* Magnetic guidance

:* Dependent on artificial sources – Navigational guidance systems where the missile tracker depends on an artificial external source:
::* Satellite navigation
:::* Global positioning system (GPS)
:::* Global navigation satellite system (GLONASS)
::* Hyperbolic navigation
:::* DECCA
:::* LORAN C

===Preset guidance===
Preset guidance is the simplest type of missile guidance. From the distance and direction of the target, the trajectory of the flight path is determined. Before firing, this information is programmed into the missile&#x27;s guidance system, which, during flight, maneuvers the missile to follow that path. All of the guidance components (including sensors such as accelerometers or gyroscopes) are contained within the missile, and no outside information (such as radio instructions) is used. An example of a missile using preset guidance is the V-2 rocket.

===Inertial guidance===
Inertial guidance uses sensitive measurement devices to calculate the location of the missile due to the acceleration put on it after leaving a known position. Early mechanical systems were not very accurate, and required some sort of external adjustment to allow them to hit targets even the size of a city. Modern systems use solid state ring laser gyros that are accurate to within metres over ranges of 10,000 km, and no longer require additional inputs. Gyroscope development has culminated in the AIRS found on the MX missile, allowing for an accuracy of less than 100 m at intercontinental ranges. Many civilian aircraft use inertial guidance using a ring laser gyroscope, which is less accurate than the mechanical systems found in ICBMs, but which provide an inexpensive means of attaining a fairly accurate fix on location (when most airliners such as Boeing&#x27;s 707 and 747 were designed, GPS was not the widely commercially available means of tracking that it is today). Today guided weapons can use a combination of INS, GPS and radar terrain mapping to achieve extremely high levels of accuracy such as that found in modern cruise missiles.

Inertial guidance is most favored for the initial guidance and reentry vehicles of strategic missiles, because it has no external signal and cannot be jammed. Additionally, the relatively low precision of this guidance method is less of an issue for large nuclear warheads.

=== Astro-inertial guidance===

Astro-inertial guidance, or stellar-inertial guidance, is a sensor fusion-information fusion of inertial guidance and celestial navigation. It is usually employed on submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Unlike silo-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, whose launch point does not move and thus can serve as a reference, SLBMs are launched from moving submarines, which complicates the necessary navigational calculations and increases circular error probable. Stellar-inertial guidance is used to correct small position and velocity errors that result from launch condition uncertainties due to errors in the submarine navigation system and errors that may have accumulated in the guidance system during the flight due to imperfect instrument calibration.

The USAF sought a precision navigation system for maintaining route accuracy and target tracking at very high speeds. Nortronics, Northrop&#x27;s electronics development division, had developed an astro-inertial navigation system (ANS), which could correct inertial navigation errors with celestial observations, for the SM-62 Snark missile, and a separate system for the ill-fated AGM-48 Skybolt missile, the latter of which was adapted for the SR-71.

It uses star positioning to fine-tune the accuracy of the inertial guidance system after launch. As the accuracy of a missile is dependent upon the guidance system knowing the exact position of the missile at any given moment during its flight, the fact that stars are a fixed reference point from which to calculate that position makes this a potentially very effective means of improving accuracy.

In the Trident missile system this was achieved by a single camera that was trained to spot just one star in its expected position (it is believed that the missiles from Soviet submarines would track two separate stars to achieve this), if it was not quite aligned to where it should be then this would indicate that the inertial system was not precisely on target and a correction would be made.

===Terrestrial guidance===

TERCOM, for &quot;terrain contour matching&quot;, uses altitude maps of the strip of land from the launch site to the target, and compares them with information from a radar altimeter on board. More sophisticated TERCOM systems allow the missile to fly a complex route over a full 3D map, instead of flying directly to the target. TERCOM is the typical system for cruise missile guidance, but is being supplanted by GPS systems and by DSMAC, digital scene-matching area correlator, which employs a camera to view an area of land, digitizes the view, and compares it to stored scenes in an onboard computer to guide the missile to its target.

DSMAC is reputed to be so lacking in robustness that destruction of prominent buildings marked in the system&#x27;s internal map (such as by a preceding cruise missile) upsets its navigation.

<text>The Shah-i-Kot Valley (also Shahi-Kot, Shah-e-Kot and other variant spellings) is a valley in the Paktia province of Afghanistan, southeast of the town of Zormat. The terrain in and around the valley is notoriously rugged, located at a mean altitude of . Shah-i-Kot means &quot;Place of the Kings&quot; in Pashto and it has historically been a redoubt for Afghan guerrillas hiding from foreign invaders.

==History==
The area was the scene of fierce fighting between the Afghan mujahideen rebels and Soviet forces during the Soviet–Afghan War, as the battle for Hill 3234.

In 2002 the valley was also the scene of Operation Anaconda, one of the largest battles of the War in Afghanistan.

<doc id="419672" wikidata="Q276274" url="?curid=419672" title="Wolverton">
<text>Wolverton ( ) is a constituent town of Milton Keynes, England. It is located in the north-west of the city, beside the West Coast Main Line, the Grand Union Canal and the river Great Ouse. It is the administrative seat of Wolverton and Greenleys civil parish.

It is one of the places in historic Buckinghamshire that went into the foundation of Milton Keynes in 1967.

The village recorded in Domesday is known today as Old Wolverton but, because of peasant clearances in the early 17th century, only field markings remain of the medieval settlement. Modern Wolverton is a new settlement founded in the early 19th century as a railway town, with its centre relocated about to the southeast.

==History==

===Old Wolverton===

The town name is an Old English language word, and means &#x27;Wulfhere&#x27;s settlement&#x27;. It was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Wluerintone&quot;. The original Wolverton was a medieval settlement just north and west of today&#x27;s town. This site is now known as Old Wolverton, although the medieval village is all but gone. The ridge and furrow pattern of agriculture can still be seen in the nearby fields.

The site of an Anglo-Saxon building has been dated to the 400s at Wolverton Mill, with further buildings coming into use in the 600s and early 700s. An Anglo-Saxon cemetery dated to the 600s was discovered in Wolverton and is the largest discovered in Buckinghamshire containing 83 people.

The Saxon Church of the Holy Trinity (rebuilt in 1819) still sits next to the Norman Motte and Bailey site. Only the earth mound remains of the Norman castle, though the Saxon tower still stands as central to the rebuilt church, clad in the early 19th century &#x27;Anglo-Norman&#x27; style. Next door to the church is a house built in 1729 which later became the vicarage; the front door has stonework from the nearby, demolished manor house of the 16th century including the de Longueville family coat of arms, and pieces from the earlier church building. A talbot (dog), another symbol of the family, once graced the side entrance which now marks the boundary between the ground floor of the house and its downstairs toilet.

The manor of Wolverton was held by the de Wolverton family until the mid-fourteenth century. Sir John de Wolverton died in 1349 leaving an infant son, Ralph, who died in 1351, and two daughters. The elder daughter Margaret or Margery, married John le Hunt, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, and had, in turn, one daughter, Joan le Hunt, who married John Longueville of Billing, Northamptonshire. They had at least one son, John, through whom Wolverton passed by inheritance to the Longueville/Longville family.

Of the historic village itself, only field patterns marking a deserted village remain, along with two village ponds. The desertion of Old Wolverton was due to enclosure of the large strip cultivation fields into small &quot;closes&quot; by the local landlords, the Longville family, who turned arable land over to pasture. By 1654, the family had completely enclosed the parish. With the end of the feudal system, the peasants had lost their land and tillage/grazing rights and were forced to find other work or starve. Thus Old Wolverton was reduced from about thirty peasant families in the mid-16th century to almost none, within the space of a century.

The newer area, built about to the southeast for the railways in the 19th century, assumed the Wolverton name.

===Canal village===
The Grand Union Canal passes around the northern and eastern edges of the modern town. The canal originally crossed the River Great Ouse by descending 10 metres to the river by nine locks, crossing the river on the level and ascending by eight locks on the other side. This was time-consuming for navigators and subject to disruption in times of flood.

===Railway town===
In 1838, Wolverton was established as the site of the locomotive repair shop at the midpoint of the London and Birmingham Railway then under construction. In 1846 the became part of the London and North Western Railway, who subsequently decided that locomotives would be built and repaired at Crewe. The last locomotives at Wolverton were built in 1863 and repaired until 1877, after which it concentrated on carriages including railway-owned road vehicles. The Works has been the home of the Royal Train fleet. During the Second World War, the Works built parts for Lee–Enfield rifles, bomber plane timber frames, Hawker Typhoon wings, Horsa Gliders, and ambulances. Like many older industrial sites, camouflage paint from the period can still be seen on the factory buildings. A pillbox remains opposite the Works Wall.

The railway company built some 200 houses for its workers by 1844 along with schools, a church and a market. L&amp;NW also invited George McCorquodale to establish what became a substantial printing works in the town.

====Church of St George the Martyr====
A new Anglican parish church was built in 1843 to serve the new town centre: like the Church of the Holy Trinity in Old Wolverton, it is a listed building rated a II*.

====Historic football ground====
The football ground beside the railway works and the station was home to the works team and subsequently to Wolverton Town football club. The stand, built in 1899, is believed to be the oldest covered football stand in the world. It was set to be demolished by September 2006 because its owners wished to redevelop the site for housing and a community park. The development went ahead and a replica stand now sits on the original site to mark the significance of the original construction, painted green as it used to be.

====The Wolverton Agora====
The Agora Centre was built by the Milton Keynes Development Corporation in 1978 to replace the old market hall on Creed Street. The Agora Centre was known for its shops as well as regular roller-disco events throughout the 1980s.

The building was either loved and hated by residents who either viewed the building as a community asset or as a blight on the town that split the town in two (due to the size of the site). The building was often called a &quot;spaceship&quot; and, when redevelopment plans were released, a &quot;farewell&quot; ceremony was held for the building at the 2019 Wolverton Lantern Festival where the &quot;Agoran&quot; aliens (represented by remote-controlled robots) returned to the Agora and shut the shutters for the final time.

The Agora Centre was demolished in 2022 and is due to be replaced with a development that reinstates the original Victorian road structure and plans to include 86 new properties and 8 shops.

Another Agora Centre is currently open for business in Bletchley&#x27;s high street, Queensway.

===Listed buildings and structures===
, Wolverton and Greenleys civil parish has two scheduled monuments and two Grade II* listed buildings.
There are a further 38 Grade II listed buildings or objects in the parish.

==Green spaces==

Wolverton was built with a park (Victoria Park) with a cricket ground, an expanse of allotments for the country people who became railway works employees, and access to the footpaths to the north and south. An extensive section of the River Great Ouse flood plain to the north of Wolverton has been excavated for sand and gravel and the resulting area developed into a nature reserve of flood-tolerant trees, called the Flood Plain Forest.

===Secret Garden===
In 1999 a group of Wolverton residents clubbed together to persuade Railtrack to sell to the Town Council a piece of derelict land for £1. The council then leased the land to the residents&#x27; group for a garden to be created. This piece of land, which sits alongside the Grand Union Canal, has been turned into a small park known locally as the “Secret Garden”, something the residents felt was missing from the largely industrial area. It is maintained by volunteers and hosts outdoor music events in the summer months. It is open to all throughout the year.

Previously the garden was the site of several townhouses built in the early Victorian era for the railways. One of the houses was the residence of the station master for Wolverton. Now the foundations and cellars of two of these houses have been excavated and form a feature in the “Secret Garden”.

==Education==
The town has a secondary school (the Radcliffe School), two primary schools (Bushfield and Wyvern) and a special school (Slated Row).

==Transport==
===Road===
Running through the town (and effectively serving as its high street) is Stratford Road, which runs westwards towards Stony Stratford and eastwards towards Newport Pagnell (and is also known as Newport Road or Wolverton Road on parts of its route). The town is also served by some major grid roads, such as Grafton Street (V6), which runs southwards towards Central Milton Keynes and Bletchley, and Monks Way (H3, A422), which runs eastwards towards Newport Pagnell and Bedford.

For accessing national routes, the A5 (towards Towcester or Dunstable), the A422 westbound (towards Buckingham) and the A508 (towards Northampton) meet about to the west of the town, at a roundabout just north of Old Stratford.

===Rail===
The town is home to a railway station on the West Coast Main Line, though only local stopping trains call there. Intercity services stop at Milton Keynes Central, about away.

A &quot;toy town&quot; wooden ticket office that stood on the railway bridge, facing out onto Stratford Road, with steps leading down to the platform was actually the third location for a station in Wolverton. The original temporary stop was on the embankment above Wolverton Park, a larger station and refreshment rooms were soon built at a location behind what is now Glyn Square. In the 1880s the main line was re-routed to the east to allow for expansion and the current station site has been in use since. The wooden station stood here for over 100 years, however Milton Keynes Council did not nominate it to be a listed building and British Rail demolished it in 1991, putting a &quot;temporary&quot; unit on platform one instead.

Since then, passengers must use stairways connecting an overhead open walkway to access the other three platforms of the station, making them inaccessible to passengers with mobility impairments. The Council&#x27;s &#x27;Regeneration Strategy for Wolverton&#x27; aimed to build a new station in the original position on the road bridge over the railway. But the new station was built at the platform level, starting in the summer of 2011 and completed in the summer of 2012.

===Bus===
Wolverton is MK&#x27;s main northern interchange point for cross-city and rural bus services. The town is served by Arriva bus numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, M5 and Stagecoach Group bus number 83.

Arriva&#x27;s main bus garage is at Colts Holm Road, Old Wolverton.

MK City Council also operates an on demand bus service known as &quot;MK Connect&quot;, which serves the whole MK unitary authority area, including Wolverton.

==Civil parish==
Wolverton formed a civil parish within the Stratford and Wolverton Rural District from 1894 to 1919, which also contained the parishes of Calverton, Stony Stratford East and Stony Stratford West. The parishes had previously been part of the Potterspury Rural Sanitary District until it was disbanded in 1894. In 1919 these parishes, combined with New Bradwell, became part of the &#x27;Stratford and Wolverton Urban District&#x27; (renamed the &#x27;Wolverton Urban District&#x27; in 1920). This urban district would remain in existence until 1974 when it became part of the then District of Milton Keynes.

In 1961 the parish of Wolverton had a population of 13,113. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished and became an unparished area of the Milton Keynes district.

Today, Wolverton is the larger element of the modern parish of Wolverton and Greenleys.

==Sport in Wolverton==
The town&#x27;s sports clubs include
* Wolverton Town Cricket Club: the club plays in Divisions 2 and 6 of The Oxford Times Cherwell League and play their home matches at the Cricket Ground on Osborne Street.
* Wolverton Town F.C., an amateur football club
* Wolverton Tennis Club
* Wolverton Town Bowls Club
* Wolverton Bowls Club
* Wolverton Pool &amp; Sports Centre – The new centre is on the site of the former &#x27;Wolverton Lido&#x27;, an open-air pool open during the summer months.

== Twin town ==
* Ploegsteert, Belgium. It was declared a sister city of Wolverton in 2006; this was partly initiated through the finding of letters from a 16-year-old soldier from Wolverton named Albert French. He is buried in Hyde Park Corner (Royal Berks) Cemetery at Comines-Warneton, just outside the village of Ploegsteert.

<doc id="419674" wikidata="Q2974181" url="?curid=419674" title="Surfboard wax">
<text>Surfboard wax (also known as surfwax) is a formulation of natural and/or synthetic wax for application to the deck of a surfboard, bodyboard, or skimboard, to keep the surfer from slipping off the board when paddling out or riding a wave. It is also used to increase grip on the paddle of a surf kayak or dragon boat.

Surfboard wax is generally composed of a mixture of paraffin, beeswax or other hard waxes; petroleum jelly can also be added to create a softer wax. Often scents like coconut or bubblegum are added. There are natural alternatives which contain only organic substances (e.g. Surf Organic) like beeswax, vegetable oils (such as coconut or hemp oil), pine resin, tree pulp and natural essential oils. There are surfboard wax formulations designed for various climates and water temperatures.
==Removal==
A plastic scraper (typically found on the back of a wax comb) can be used to remove surfboard wax in large chunks. Residual wax that has not been removed by scraping can be removed with a soft cloth, either on its own or in combination with (for example) coconut oil. Various commercial solvents are also available but can damage the surfboard or its detailing. Surfers will also sometimes intentionally allow surfboard wax to melt in the sun, making the wax easier to remove.

==Wax comb==

A wax comb is a tool used in the maintenance and removal of surfboard wax on a surfboard. Wax combs typically have features such a jagged or toothed edge and a straight, relatively sharp edge. The jagged edge is used to create textured grooves for improving the traction of the wax and the straight edge is used for scraping off unwanted wax. In addition to the straight edge for wax removal, some wax combs even have an inwardly curved edge for the rails (such as Mr. Zog&#x27;s Sex Wax “Sex Comb”). Additionally, wax combs can have features such as fin key, bottle opener or a snap for portability (attachment to interior pocket loop, lanyard or leash attachment lanyard).

==Temperature==

Most surfboard wax comes labeled with a water temperature range for which it is ideal. Wax used in water colder than its rating will become hard and not provide the stickiness needed to stay on the board, while wax used in water warmer than its rating may melt. This makes application of the correct type of wax important.

==Application==

Surfboard wax is applied by first putting a base coat onto the clean board. This harder base coat forms a bump pattern on the surfboard to which the surfer will stick. The base coat is then topped with a coat of wax of an appropriate temperature. 

When re-applying surfboard wax, it is always crucial to remove all prior layers of wax.

<doc id="419677" wikidata="Q7818170" url="?curid=419677" title="Tom o' Bedlam">
<text>&quot;Tom o&#x27; Bedlam&quot; is the title of an anonymous poem in the &quot;mad song&quot; genre, written in the voice of a homeless &quot;Bedlamite&quot;. The poem was probably composed at the beginning of the 17th century. In &quot;How to Read and Why&quot; Harold Bloom called it &quot;the greatest anonymous lyric in the [English] language.&quot;

The terms &quot;Tom o&#x27; Bedlam&quot; and “Bedlam beggar” were used to describe beggars and vagrants who had or feigned mental illness (see also Abraham-men). Aubrey writes that such a beggar could be identified by “an armilla of tin printed, of about three inches breadth” attached to his left arm. They claimed, or were assumed, to be former inmates of the Bethlem Royal Hospital (Bedlam). It was commonly thought that inmates were released with authority to make their way by begging, though this is probably untrue. If it happened at all, the numbers were small, though there were probably large numbers of mentally ill travellers who turned to begging, but had never been near Bedlam. It was adopted as a technique of begging, or a character. For example, Edgar in &quot;King Lear&quot; disguises himself as mad &quot;Tom o&#x27; Bedlam&quot;.

==Structure and verses==
The poem has eight verses of eight lines each, each verse concluding with a repetition of a four-line chorus. The existence of a chorus suggests that the poem may originally have been sung as a ballad. The version reproduced here is the one presented in Bloom&#x27;s &quot;How to Read and Why&quot;.

&lt;poem style=&quot;border: 2px solid #d6d2c5; background-color: #f9f4e6; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;

Tom o&#x27; Bedlam

From the hag and hungry goblin
That into rags would rend ye,
The spirit that stands by the naked man 
In the Book of Moons defend ye,
That of your five sound senses
You never be forsaken,
Nor wander from your selves with Tom
Abroad to beg your bacon,
::While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,
::Feeding, drink, or clothing;
::Come dame or maid, be not afraid,
::Poor Tom will injure nothing.

Of thirty bare years have I
Twice twenty been enragèd,
And of forty been three times fifteen
In durance soundly cagèd
On the lordly lofts of Bedlam,
With stubble soft and dainty,
Brave bracelets strong, sweet whips ding-dong,
With wholesome hunger plenty,
::And now I sing, Any food, any feeding,
::Feeding, drink, or clothing;
::Come dame or maid, be not afraid,
::Poor Tom will injure nothing.

With a thought I took for Maudlin
And a cruse of cockle pottage,
With a thing thus tall, sky bless you all,
I befell into this dotage.
I slept not since the Conquest,
Till then I never wakèd,
Till the roguish boy of love where I lay
Me found and stript me nakèd.
::And now I sing, Any food, any feeding,
::Feeding, drink, or clothing;
::Come dame or maid, be not afraid,
::Poor Tom will injure nothing.

When I short have shorn my sow&#x27;s face
And swigged my horny barrel,
In an oaken inn I pound my skin
As a suit of gilt apparel;
The moon&#x27;s my constant mistress,
And the lowly owl my marrow;
The flaming drake and the night crow make
Me music to my sorrow.
::While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,
::Feeding, drink, or clothing;
::Come dame or maid, be not afraid,
::Poor Tom will injure nothing.

The palsy plagues my pulses
When I prig your pigs or pullen,
Your culvers take, or matchless make
Your Chanticleer or Sullen.
When I want provant with Humphrey
I sup, and when benighted,
I repose in Paul&#x27;s with waking souls
Yet never am affrighted.
::But I do sing, Any food, any feeding,
::Feeding, drink, or clothing;
::Come dame or maid, be not afraid,
::Poor Tom will injure nothing.

I know more than Apollo,
For oft, when he lies sleeping
I see the stars at bloody wars
In the wounded welkin weeping;
The moon embrace her shepherd,
And the Queen of Love her warrior,
While the first doth horn the star of morn,
And the next the heavenly Farrier.
::While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,
::Feeding, drink, or clothing;
::Come dame or maid, be not afraid,
::Poor Tom will injure nothing.

The gypsies, Snap and Pedro,
Are none of Tom&#x27;s comradoes,
The punk I scorn and the cutpurse sworn,
And the roaring boy&#x27;s bravadoes.
The meek, the white, the gentle
Me handle, touch, and spare not;
But those that cross Tom Rynosseros
Do what the panther dare not.
::Although I sing, Any food, any feeding,
::Feeding, drink, or clothing;
::Come dame or maid, be not afraid,
::Poor Tom will injure nothing.

With a host of furious fancies
Whereof I am commander,
With a burning spear and a horse of air,
To the wilderness I wander.
By a knight of ghosts and shadows
I summoned am to tourney
Ten leagues beyond the wide world&#x27;s end:
Methinks it is no journey.
::Yet will I sing, Any food, any feeding,
::Feeding, drink, or clothing;
::Come dame or maid, be not afraid,
::Poor Tom will injure nothing.&lt;/poem&gt;

==&quot;Mad Maudlin&#x27;s Search&quot;==

The original ballad was popular enough that another poem was written in reply: &quot;Mad Maudlin&#x27;s Search&quot; or &quot;Mad Maudlin&#x27;s Search for Her Tom of Bedlam&quot; (she may be meant to be the Maud who seems to be mentioned in the verse &quot;With a thought I took for Maudlin / And a cruise of cockle pottage / With a thing thus tall, Sky bless you all / I befell into this dotage.&quot; which apparently records Tom going mad) or &quot;Bedlam Boys&quot; (from the chorus, &quot;Still I sing bonny boys, bonny mad boys / Bedlam boys are bonny / For they all go bare and they live by the air / And they want no drink or money.&quot;), whose first stanza is:

:For to see Mad Tom of Bedlam,
:Ten thousand miles I&#x27;ve traveled.
:Mad Maudlin goes on dirty toes,
:For to save her shoes from gravel

The remaining stanzas include:

:I went down to Satan&#x27;s kitchen
:To break my fast one morning
:And there I got souls piping hot
:All on the spit a-turning.

:There I took a cauldron
:Where boiled ten thousand harlots
:Though full of flame I drank the same
:To the health of all such varlets.

:My staff has murdered giants
:My bag a long knife carries
:To cut mince pies from children&#x27;s thighs
:For which to feed the fairies.

:No gypsy, slut or doxy
:Shall win my mad Tom from me
:I&#x27;ll weep all night, with stars I&#x27;ll fight
:The fray shall well become me.

It was apparently first published in 1720 by Thomas d&#x27;Urfey in his &quot;Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy&quot;. &quot;Maudlin&quot; was a form of Mary Magdalene.

Because of the number of variants of each poem, and confusion between the two, neither &quot;Tom o&#x27; Bedlam&quot; nor &quot;Mad Maudlin&quot; can be said to have definitive texts.

The folk-rock band Steeleye Span recorded &quot;Boys of Bedlam&quot;, a version of &quot;Mad Maudlin&quot;, on their 1971 album &quot;Please To See The King&quot;. Steeleye recorded a very different arrangement on &quot;Dodgy Bastards&quot; (2016), which included a rap section and a bassline that set the song in the Phrygian mode.

== In modern culture ==

* Lin Carter included the poem in his 1969 fantasy anthology Dragons, Elves, and Heroes.
* Tom o&#x27; Bedlam is the name Edgar gives in Shakespeare&#x27;s King Lear when he pretends to be a mad vagrant. It is also to be found in a case before Star Chamber in 1632 when a Sussex man complains of being defamed in a set of verses sung in the ale houses of Rye to the tune of Tom o&#x27; Bedlam, further indication that it was a ballad.
* Kenneth Patchen&#x27;s surrealist novel &quot;The Journal of Albion Moonlight&quot; is loosely based on and makes frequent reference to the poem.
* Robert Silverberg&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Tom O&#x27; Bedlam&quot; (1985) includes several quotations from the poem. The main character also calls himself by that name.
* John Brunner&#x27;s 1968 novel &quot;Bedlam Planet&quot; prefaces each chapter with entire stanzas from the poem, titling the chapter after the subject of the stanza.
* Mercedes Lackey has co-authored a series of books whose titles are taken from verses of the poem.
* Parts of Derek Walcott&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Bounty&quot; (1997), are addressed to &quot;mad Tom.&quot;
* Folk rock band Steeleye Span set the poem to music on the album &quot;Please to See the King&quot;.
* Jolie Holland recorded a version of Maudlin&#x27;s song titled &quot;Mad Tom of Bedlam&quot; on her 2004 album &quot;Escondida&quot;. Charlene Kaye also recorded this version for her &quot;The Brilliant Eyes&quot; EP.
* Old Blind Dogs, a traditional Scottish band, recorded a version titled &quot;Bedlam Boys&quot; on their 1992 debut album &quot;New Tricks&quot; and a new arrangement on their 2004 album &quot;Four on the Floor&quot;.
* A recording of the poem sung in the style of a tavern song is included in the soundtrack of the video game &quot;Stronghold 3&quot;. For unknown reasons, the line &quot;Ten thousand miles I&#x27;ve traveled&quot; was changed to &quot;Ten thousand &quot;years&quot; I &quot;travel&quot;&quot;.
* An incidental character in Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s &quot;Brother Dusty-Feet&quot; is called &quot;Tom o&#x27; Bedlam&quot; and sings this poem (anachronistically: &quot;Brother Dusty-Feet&quot; is set in the reign of Queen Elizabeth), of which only the last verse (without the refrain) occurs in the text.
* In the 2015 video game Assassin&#x27;s Creed Syndicate, there are 31 hidden music boxes scattered throughout 1868 London&#x27;s streets. When one goes to the Progression Log and look under &quot;Secrets Of London&quot;, they can see the locations of each of the 31 music boxes as a screenshot showing the box and whatever is nearby, leaving it up to the player to figure out exactly where it is. Additionally, each entry is accompanied by a 4-line quote from &quot;Tom o&#x27; Bedlam&quot;.

<text>Wooburn is a large village in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located off the A4094 road between Wooburn Green and Bourne End in the very south of the county near the River Thames, about two miles south west of Beaconsfield and four miles east of Marlow. Wooburn is one of the two principal settlements within Wooburn, a civil parish in Wycombe district.

The village toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;walled stream&quot;. This refers to the River Wye, which has its source near West Wycombe and runs through the village to join the River Thames at Bourne End. The river runs along the boundary of Warren Nature Reserve, a Local Nature Reserve which adjoins Wooburn Park. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was recorded as &quot;Waborne&quot; though earlier, in 1075, it had been referred to as &quot;Waburna&quot;.
The Church of England parish church of Saint Paul is medieval but was extensively altered by the Gothic Revival architect William Butterfield in 1869. It has a flint nave and a tall tower. There are some half timbered houses facing the churchyard and nearby there is a flint school house.

The manor house of Wooburn was once a palace of the Bishops of Lincoln.

The former Wooburn Grange Country Club was used as the exterior of the Fawlty Towers hotel in the classic 1970s sitcom. The building was destroyed by a fire in 1991, then demolished and a housing estate was built on the site.

<doc id="419680" wikidata="Q4931878" url="?curid=419680" title="Bob Boone">
<text>Robert Raymond Boone (born November 19, 1947) is an American former catcher and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB) who was a four-time All-Star.

Born in San Diego, California, he is the son of MLB player Ray Boone, and he is the father of two major leaguers: Bret Boone and Aaron Boone. All four family members were named All-Stars during their careers.

==Professional career==

===Philadelphia Phillies===
Boone was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the sixth round (126th overall) of the 1969 amateur draft after attending Stanford University where he was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity. He was brought to the majors in late 1972. While Boone never had excellent hitting numbers, he was an excellent defensive catcher, committing only eight errors and allowing only three passed balls in the 1977 season. Boone made the National League All-Star team three times in a Phillies uniform and helped the team win the 1980 World Series. In 1981, he batted .211/.279/.295. 

In 2005, Boone was inducted into the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame.

===California Angels===
In 1982, the Phillies decided to trade the veteran catcher to the California Angels following an unproductive year from Boone and also as a possible retaliation for Boone&#x27;s key role in leading the players in negotiations during the 1981 Major League Baseball strike. Boone rebounded by throwing out 21 of the first 34 steal attempts and helping the Angels to the AL West title. In 1983, he made his fourth and final All-Star appearance.

On September 30, 1984, Boone caught Mike Witt&#x27;s perfect game.

===Kansas City Royals===
As a free agent, Boone signed with the Kansas City Royals, but a broken finger in 1990 led to his retirement at age 42 following his shortened season, in which he batted .239/.336/.265.

Boone was a career .254/.315/.346 hitter with 1,838 hits, 105 home runs (HR) and 826 runs batted in (RBI), in 2,264 games. He was selected an All-Star in 1976, 1978–79, and 1983. Boone was one of the top defensive catchers of his era, winning seven Gold Glove awards. He caught 2,225 games in a 19-year big league career, a record that lasted for three years until Carlton Fisk passed him (the record currently is held by Iván Rodríguez, with 2,427). Boone caught 117 shutouts during his career, ranking him tied for 13th all-time in 2010 among major league catchers.

==Managerial career==
In 1990, just after Boone retired as a player, a group trying to bring an MLB franchise to Orlando (called the Orlando SunRays) hired him to be its first manager. The job was contingent on Orlando being awarded a National League franchise to begin play in 1993; the NL instead chose Miami and Denver.

Boone returned to the Royals in 1995 as the team&#x27;s manager but was let go during the 1997 season after a third straight sub-.500 season. In 2001, he was hired to be the skipper of the Cincinnati Reds, replacing Jack McKeon. However, after another two and a half sub-.500 seasons, the Reds replaced Boone with Ray Knight, on July 28, 2003.

===Managerial record===
==Personal life==
Bob and his family are descendants of American pioneer Daniel Boone. Bob Boone and his wife, Susan Boone, have three sons. Two of his sons, Aaron Boone and Bret Boone, are former Major League Baseball players. Aaron Boone is currently the manager of the New York Yankees. Bret&#x27;s son Jake Boone is an infielder in the Washington Nationals minor league system.

Bob Boone&#x27;s extended family have been sportsmen. His mother, Patsy Boone, was a synchronized swimmer who swam with Esther Williams in the movies. His sister Terry Boone was a champion swimmer, and his brother Rod Boone was a college baseball star who played Triple-A ball in the Astros and Royals organizations.

<text>Woodham is a hamlet and civil parish about west of Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. At the 2011 Census the population of the hamlet was included in the civil parish of Kingswood.

The toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;home near a wood&quot;, referring to its proximity to the ancient Bernwood Forest.

Woodham is on the ancient Akeman Street Roman road, which since the 1920s has been classified as the A41.

In 1906 the Great Central Railway built a line through the parish and opened Akeman Street railway station where it crossed the main road at Woodham. The station had a short working life, being closed by the GCR&#x27;s successor the London and North Eastern Railway in 1930.

<doc id="419683" wikidata="Q639709" url="?curid=419683" title="Earl of Leicester">
<text>Earl of Leicester is a title that has been created seven times. The first title was granted during the 12th century in the Peerage of England. The current title is in the Peerage of the United Kingdom and was created in 1837.

==History==

===Early creations===
The title was first created for Robert de Beaumont (also spelt de Bellomont), but he nearly always used his French title of Count of Meulan. Three generations of his descendants, all also named Robert, called themselves Earls of Leicester. The Beaumont male line ended with the death of the 4th Earl. His property was split between his two sisters, with Simon IV de Montfort, the son of the eldest sister, acquiring Leicester and the rights to the earldom. (The husband of the younger daughter, Saer de Quincy, was created Earl of Winchester.) However, Simon IV de Montfort was never formally recognized as earl, due to the antipathy between France and England at that time. His second son, Simon V de Montfort, did succeed in taking possession of the earldom and its associated properties. He is the Simon de Montfort who became so prominent during the reign of Henry III. He was killed at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, and his lands and titles were forfeited.

In 1267 the title was created a second time and granted to the king&#x27;s youngest son, Edmund Crouchback. In 1276 he also became Earl of Lancaster, and the titles became united. Crouchback&#x27;s son Thomas lost the earldom when he was executed for treason in 1322, but a few years later, it was restored to his younger brother Henry. Henry&#x27;s son Henry of Grosmont left only two daughters, and his estate was divided between them, the eldest daughter Matilda receiving the earldom, which was held by her husband William V of Holland. (The two passages of the earldom via females illustrate the medieval practice by which such inheritance was allowed in the absence of male heirs.) Matilda, however, soon died, and the title passed to John of Gaunt, husband of her younger sister, Blanche, who was later created Duke of Lancaster. Both the dukedom and the earldom were inherited by John of Gaunt&#x27;s son, Henry Bolingbroke, and both titles ceased to exist when Henry usurped the throne, as the titles &quot;merged into the crown&quot;. (The peers are vassals to the Sovereign, and no one can be a vassal to himself.) The properties associated with the earldom became part of what was later called the Duchy of Lancaster.

In 1564 the earldom was again created for Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s favourite, Robert Dudley. Since Dudley died without heirs, the title became extinct at his death. The title was again created in 1618 for Robert Sidney (Baron Sydney), his nephew. Prior to being granted the earldom, Robert Sidney was granted the subsidiary title of Viscount Lisle on 4 May 1605. The Sidneys retained the titles until the death of the seventh Earl in 1743, when the titles again became extinct. The title of earl was then recreated for Thomas Coke (pronounced &quot;Cook&quot;), but it became extinct when he, too, died without heirs.

===1784 creation===
The title was again bestowed upon George Townshend, 17th Baron Ferrers of Chartley and 8th Baron Compton, eldest son and heir apparent of George Townshend, 4th Viscount Townshend, later the first Marquess Townshend. Townshend was a female-line great-great-great-grandson of Lady Lucy Sydney, daughter of the second Earl of the 1618 creation. The earldom became extinct yet again upon the death of his son, the third Marquess and second Earl, in 1855 (the marquessate was passed on to a cousin and is extant).

===1744 and 1837 creations===
The Coke family is descended from the noted judge and politician Sir Edward Coke, Lord Chief Justice from 1613 to 1616. Through his son Henry Coke, his great-great-great-grandson Thomas Coke was a landowner, politician and patron of arts. In 1728 he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Lovel, of Minster Lovel in the County of Oxford, and in 1744 he was created Viscount Coke, of Holkham in the County of Norfolk, and Earl of Leicester, also in the Peerage of Great Britain. Lord Leicester began the construction of Holkham Hall in Norfolk. He married Lady Margaret Tufton, 19th Baroness de Clifford (1700—1775) (see the Baron de Clifford for earlier history of this title). Their only child Edward Coke, Viscount Coke, predeceased both his parents, without issue. Consequently, Lord Leicester&#x27;s titles became extinct on his death in 1759 while the barony of de Clifford fell into abeyance on Lady de Clifford&#x27;s death in 1775.

The Coke estates were passed on to the late Earl&#x27;s nephew Wenman Coke. Born Wenman Roberts, he was the son of Philip Roberts and Anne, sister of Lord Leicester, and assumed the surname of Coke in lieu of Roberts. His son Thomas Coke was a politician and noted agriculturalist. Known as &quot;Coke of Norfolk&quot;, he sat as a Member of Parliament for many years but is best remembered for his interest in agricultural improvements and is seen as one of the instigators of the British Agricultural Revolution. In 1837 the titles held by his great-uncle were revived when Coke was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Viscount Coke and Earl of Leicester, of Holkham in the County of Norfolk. This was despite the fact that the 1784 creation of the earldom held by the Townshend family was then still extant (then &quot;usurped&quot; by John Dunn-Gardner), hence the territorial designation &quot;of Holkham&quot;. Lord Leicester was succeeded by his eldest son from his second marriage, the second Earl. He served as Lord-Lieutenant of Norfolk for sixty years and was made a Knight of the Garter in 1873.
On his death in 1909 the titles passed to his eldest son, the third Earl. He was a colonel in the 2nd Battalion of the Scots Guards and also served as Lord-Lieutenant of Norfolk. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Earl in 1944. He was also Lord-Lieutenant of Norfolk. His younger son, David Arthur Coke was a friend of the author Roald Dahl but was killed in action during the second world war in December 1941. When he (fourth Earl) died the titles passed to his eldest son, the fifth Earl, in 1949. He was an Extra Equerry to both George VI and Elizabeth II. He died without male issue and was succeeded by his first cousin, the sixth Earl in 1976. He was the son of the Hon. Arthur George Coke, second son of the third Earl. Upon his death in 1994, his son became the 7th Earl of Leicester. the titles are held by his son Thomas Edward Coke, the eighth Earl, who succeeded in that year.

The family seat is Holkham Hall, near Wells-next-the-Sea, Norfolk. The traditional burial place of the Coke family is a plot situated on the south side of the churchyard of the Holkham parish church of St Withburga. A family mausoleum was built in the same churchyard in the 1870s, but was later abandoned. Many members of the Coke family during the post-medieval period were also buried in St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Tittleshall.

<doc id="419684" wikidata="Q2484379" url="?curid=419684" title="Worminghall">
<text>Worminghall is a village and civil parish in the Buckinghamshire district of the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire, England.

The village is beside a brook that forms most of the eastern boundary of the parish. The brook joins the River Thame, which forms the southernmost part of the eastern boundary. The western boundary of the parish also forms part of the county boundary with Oxfordshire. The village is about west of the Oxfordshire market town of Thame.

The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 534.

==Toponym==
The Domesday Book of 1086 records the village&#x27;s toponym as &quot;Wermelle&quot;. An entry written in 1163 in a pipe roll records it as &quot;Wurmehal&quot;, and an entry made in 1229 in an episcopal register records it as &quot;Wirmehale&quot;. Other spellings included &quot;Wormehale&quot; in the 12th and 13th centuries, &quot;Wrmehale&quot; in the 13th and 14th centuries, &quot;Worminghale&quot; in the 14th and 15th centuries and &quot;Wornall&quot; in the 18th century. &quot;Wornall&quot; (or &quot;Wunnle&quot;) are still common local pronunciations.

The toponym is derived from Old English. &quot;Halh&quot; is a nook or corner of land. &quot;Wyrma&quot; could be either the name of a man who held the land, or a reference to &quot;worms&quot; living there. In Old and Middle English usage, &quot;worm&quot; could mean reptiles, as in the legend of the Lambton Worm.

J. R. R. Tolkien in his novella &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; suggests (tongue-in-cheek) that the &#x27;worm&#x27; element in Worminghall derives from the dragon in the story.

==Manor==
In the reign of Edward the Confessor, the manor of Worminghall was part of the estates of his queen, Edith of Wessex. The Domesday Book records that after the Norman conquest of England, &quot;Wermelle&quot; was assessed at five hides and was one of many manors held by the powerful Norman nobleman Geoffrey de Montbray, Bishop of Coutances. Worminghall became part of the Honour of Gloucester and passed via Hugh de Audley, 1st Earl of Gloucester (1291–1347) and then Margaret de Audley, 2nd Baroness Audley to Hugh de Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford (died 1386).

However, Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester rebelled against Richard II in 1388. Thomas was attaindered in 1397, and Worminghall was amongst the estates that Thomas forfeited to Henry of Bolingbroke, 3rd Earl of Derby. When Henry father John of Gaunt died in 1399, the Earl was crowned Henry IV of England and Worminghall thus became part of the Duchy of Lancaster. Crown rights to Worminghall appear in a record dating from 1562.

==Parish church==

The Church of England parish church of Saints Peter and Paul is Norman, and the north and south doorways survive from this time. The chancel was built or rebuilt in the 14th century and the bell tower was added in the 15th century. In 1847 the north wall was rebuilt and the present stained glass was inserted in the 15th century east window. The church is a Grade II* listed building.

The tower has a ring of three bells and there is also a Sanctus bell. John Taylor &amp; Co recast all four bells in 1847 at the foundry they had at the time in Oxford.

Saints Peter and Paul&#x27;s is now part of the Benefice of Worminghall with Ickford, Oakley and Shabbington.

==Social and economic history==
Worminghall had a windmill by about 1160 or 1170. A windmill is recorded again in the 14th century, along with a fishery.

The Clifden Arms public house is a timber framed building with brick nogging and a thatched roof. The older part is medieval and the newer wing was added in the 17th century. The pub&#x27;s current name is more recent, being derived from an 18th or 19th century Viscount Clifden who was heir to the advowson of the parish.

Wood Farm, nearly west of the village, has a barn that was built in the 17th century or possibly earlier. It is of six bays and is built of rubblestone with ashlar quoins, and was re-roofed in 1779 with a double purlin roof.
John King founded an almshouse charity in 1670 in memory of his father Henry King (1592–1669) who was Bishop of Chichester and a poet. There are ten almshouses, for six old men and four old women. They were built in 1675 and are now a Grade II* listed building.
A parish school was built in Worminghall in the 19th century. Its Victorian building of polychromatic brick is now the village hall.

===RAF Oakley===
RAF Oakley occupied much of the northern part of Worminghall parish from 1942 until 1945. Many of its buildings survive, and those on the south side of the airfield now form the nucleus of a trading estate. This is called Wornal Industrial Park, maintaining the traditional pronunciation and 18th century spelling of the toponym.

==Amenities==

The Clifden Arms is now a gastropub and hotel.

<text>Pedagogy (), most commonly understood as the approach to teaching, is the theory and practice of learning, and how this process influences, and is influenced by, the social, political, and psychological development of learners. Pedagogy, taken as an academic discipline, is the study of how knowledge and skills are imparted in an educational context, and it considers the interactions that take place during learning. Both the theory and practice of pedagogy vary greatly as they reflect different social, political, and cultural contexts.

Pedagogy is often described as the act of teaching. The pedagogy adopted by teachers shapes their actions, judgments, and teaching strategies by taking into consideration theories of learning, understandings of students and their needs, and the backgrounds and interests of individual students. Its aims may range from furthering liberal education (the general development of human potential) to the narrower specifics of vocational education (the imparting and acquisition of specific skills).

Instructive strategies are governed by the pupil&#x27;s background knowledge and experience, situation and environment, as well as learning goals set by the student and teacher. One example would be the Socratic method.

==Definition==
The meaning of the term &quot;pedagogy&quot; is often contested and a great variety of definitions has been suggested. The most common approach is to define it as the study or science of teaching methods. In this sense, it is the methodology of education. As a methodology, it investigates the ways and practices that can be used to realize the aims of education. The main aim is often identified with the transmission of knowledge. Other aims include fostering skills and character traits. They include helping the student develop their intellectual and social abilities as well as psychomotor and affective learning, which are about developing practical skills and adequate emotional dispositions, respectively.

However, not everyone agrees with this characterization of pedagogy and some see it less as a science and more as an art or a craft. This characterization puts more emphasis on the practical aspect of pedagogy, which may involve various forms of &quot;tacit knowledge that is hard to put into words&quot;. This approach is often based on the idea that the most central aspects of teaching are only acquired by practice and cannot be easily codified through scientific inquiry. In this regard, pedagogy is concerned with &quot;observing and refining one&#x27;s skill as a teacher&quot;. A more inclusive definition combines these two characterizations and sees pedagogy both as the practice of teaching and the discourse and study of teaching methods. Some theorists give an even wider definition by including considerations such as &quot;the development of health and bodily fitness, social and moral welfare, ethics and aesthetics&quot;. Due to this variety of meanings, it is sometimes suggested that pedagogy is a &quot;catch-all term&quot; associated with various issues of teaching and learning. In this sense, it lacks a precise definition.

According to Patricia Murphy, a detailed reflection on the meaning of the term &quot;pedagogy&quot; is important nonetheless since different theorists often use it in very different ways. In some cases, non-trivial assumptions about the nature of learning are even included in its definition. Pedagogy is often specifically understood in relation to school education. But in a wider sense, it includes all forms of education, both inside and outside schools. In this wide sense, it is concerned with the process of teaching taking place between two parties: teachers and learners. The teacher&#x27;s goal is to bring about certain experiences in the learner to foster their understanding of the subject matter to be taught. Pedagogy is interested in the forms and methods used to convey this understanding.

Pedagogy is closely related to didactics but there are some differences. Usually, didactics is seen as the more limited term that refers mainly to the teacher&#x27;s role and activities, i.e how their behavior is most beneficial to the process of education. This is one central aspect of pedagogy besides other aspects that consider the learner&#x27;s perspective as well. In this wider sense, pedagogy focuses on &quot;any conscious activity by one person designed to enhance learning in another&quot;.

The word &quot;pedagogy&quot; is a derivative of the Greek (&quot;paidagōgia&quot;), from (&quot;paidagōgos&quot;), itself a synthesis of (&quot;ágō&quot;), &quot;I lead&quot;, and (, genitive , ) &quot;boy, child&quot;: hence, &quot;attendance on boys, to lead a child&quot;. It is pronounced variously, as , , or . The related word &quot;pedagogue&quot; has had a negative connotation of pedantry, dating from at least the 1650s; a related expression is &quot;educational theorist&quot;. The term &quot;pedagogy&quot; is also found in the English discourse, but it is more broadly discussed in other European languages, such as French and German.

==History==
=== Western ===
In the Western world, pedagogy is associated with the Greek tradition of philosophical dialogue, particularly the Socratic method of inquiry. A more general account of its development holds that it emerged from the active concept of humanity as distinct from a fatalistic one and that history and human destiny are results of human actions. This idea germinated in ancient Greece and was further developed during the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the Age of Enlightenment.

==== Socrates ====

Socrates (470 – 399 BCE) employed the Socratic method while engaging with a student or peer. This style does not impart knowledge, but rather tries to strengthen the logic of the student by revealing the conclusions of the statement of the student as erroneous or supported. The instructor in this learning environment recognizes the learners&#x27; need to think for themselves to facilitate their ability to think about problems and issues. It was first described by Plato in the &quot;Socratic Dialogues&quot;.

==== Plato ====

Plato (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BCE) describes a system of education in &quot;The Republic (375 BCE)&quot; in which individual and family rights are sacrificed to the State. He describes three castes: one to learn a trade; one to learn literary and aesthetic ideas; and one to be trained in literary, aesthetic, scientific, and philosophical ideas. Plato saw education as a fulfillment of the soul, and by fulfilling the soul the body subsequently benefited. Plato viewed physical education for all as a necessity to a stable society.

==== Aristotle ====

Aristotle (384–322 BCE) composed a treatise, &quot;On Education&quot;, which was subsequently lost. However, he renounced Plato&#x27;s view in subsequent works, advocating for a common education mandated to all citizens by the State. A small minority of people residing within Greek city-states at this time were considered citizens, and thus Aristotle still limited education to a minority within Greece. Aristotle advocates physical education should precede intellectual studies.

==== Quintilian ====

Marcus Fabius Quintilianus (35 – 100 CE) published his pedagogy in &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot; (95 CE). He describes education as a gradual affair, and places certain responsibilities on the teacher. He advocates for rhetorical, grammatical, scientific, and philosophical education.

==== Tertullian ====

Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus (155 – 240 CE) was a Christian scholar who rejected all pagan education, insisting this was &quot;a road to the false and arrogant wisdom of ancient philosophers&quot;.

==== Jerome ====

Saint Jerome (347 – 30 September 420 CE), or Saint Hieronymus, was a Christian scholar who detailed his pedagogy of girls in numerous letters throughout his life. He did not believe the body in need of training, and thus advocated for fasting and mortification to subdue the body. He only recommends the Bible as reading material, with limited exposure, and cautions against musical instruments. He advocates against letting girls interact with society, and of having &quot;affections for one of her companions than for others.&quot; He does recommend teaching the alphabet by ivory blocks instead of memorization so &quot;She will thus learn by playing.&quot; He is an advocate of positive reinforcement, stating &quot;Do not chide her for the difficulty she may have in learning. On the contrary, encourage her by commendation...&quot;

==== Jean Gerson ====

Jean Charlier de Gerson (13 December 1363 – 12 July 1429), the Chancellor of the University of Paris, wrote in &quot;De parvulis ad Christum trahendis&quot; &quot;Little children are more easily managed by caresses than fear,&quot; supporting a more gentle approach than his Christian predecessors. He also states &quot;Above all else, let the teacher make an effort to be a father to his pupils.&quot; He is considered a precursor of Fenelon.

==== John Amos Comenius ====

John Amos Comenius (28 March 1592 – 15 November 1670) is considered the father of modern education.

====Johann Pestalozzi====

Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (January 12, 1746 – February 17, 1827), founder of several educational institutions both in German- and French-speaking regions of Switzerland and wrote many works explaining his revolutionary modern principles of education. His motto was &quot;Learning by head, hand and heart&quot;.

====Johann Herbart====

The educational philosophy and pedagogy of Johann Friedrich Herbart (4 May 1776 – 14 August 1841) highlighted the correlation between personal development and the resulting benefits to society. In other words, Herbart proposed that humans become fulfilled once they establish themselves as productive citizens. Herbartianism refers to the movement underpinned by Herbart&#x27;s theoretical perspectives. Referring to the teaching process, Herbart suggested five steps as crucial components. Specifically, these five steps include: preparation, presentation, association, generalization, and application. Herbart suggests that pedagogy relates to having assumptions as an educator and a specific set of abilities with a deliberate end goal in mind.

==== John Dewey ====

The pedagogy of John Dewey (20 October 1859 – 1 June 1952) is presented in several works, including &quot;My Pedagogic Creed&quot; (1897), &quot;The School and Society&quot; (1900), &quot;The Child and the Curriculum&quot; (1902), &quot;Democracy and Education&quot; (1916), &quot;Schools of To-morrow&quot; (1915) with Evelyn Dewey, and &quot;Experience and Education&quot; (1938). In his eyes, the purpose of education should not revolve around the acquisition of a pre-determined set of skills, but rather the realization of one&#x27;s full potential and the ability to use those skills for the greater good (&quot;My Pedagogic Creed&quot;, Dewey, 1897). Dewey advocated for an educational structure that strikes a balance between delivering knowledge while also taking into account the interests and experiences of the student (&quot;The Child and the Curriculum, Dewey,&quot; 1902). Dewey not only re-imagined the way that the learning process should take place but also the role that the teacher should play within that process. He envisioned a divergence from the mastery of a pre-selected set of skills to the cultivation of autonomy and critical-thinking within the teacher and student alike.

=== Eastern ===

==== Confucius ====

Confucius (551–479 BCE) stated that authority has the responsibility to provide oral and written instruction to the people under the rule, and &quot;should do them good in every possible way.&quot; One of the deepest teachings of Confucius may have been the superiority of personal exemplification over explicit rules of behavior. His moral teachings emphasized self-cultivation, emulation of moral exemplars, and the attainment of skilled judgement rather than knowledge of rules. Other relevant practices in the Confucian teaching tradition include the Rite and its notion of body-knowledge as well as Confucian understanding of the self, one that has a broader conceptualization than the Western individual self.

==Pedagogical considerations==

===Teaching method===
===Hidden curriculum===

A hidden curriculum refers to extra educational activities or side effect of an education, &quot;[lessons] which are learned but not openly intended&quot; such as the transmission of norms, values, and beliefs conveyed in the classroom and the social environment.

===Learning space===

Learning space or learning setting refers to a physical setting for a learning environment, a place in which teaching and learning occur. The term is commonly used as a more definitive alternative to &quot;classroom&quot;, but it may also refer to an indoor or outdoor location, either actual or virtual. Learning spaces are highly diverse in use, learning styles, configuration, location, and educational institution. They support a variety of pedagogies, including quiet study, passive or active learning, kinesthetic or physical learning, vocational learning, experiential learning, and others.

===Learning theories===

Learning theories are conceptual frameworks describing how knowledge is absorbed, processed, and retained during learning. Cognitive, emotional, and environmental influences, as well as prior experience, all play a part in how understanding, or a world view, is acquired or changed and knowledge and skills retained.

===Distance learning===

Distance education or long-distance learning is the education of students who may not always be physically present at a school. Traditionally, this usually involved correspondence courses wherein the student corresponded with the school via post. Today it involves online education. Courses that are conducted (51 percent or more) are either hybrid, blended or 100% distance learning. Massive open online courses (MOOCs), offering large-scale interactive participation and open access through the World Wide Web or other network technologies, are recent developments in distance education. A number of other terms (distributed learning, e-learning, online learning, etc.) are used roughly synonymously with distance education.

=== Teaching resource adaptation ===
Adapting the teaching resource should suit appropriate teaching and learning environments, national and local cultural norms, and make it accessible to different types of learners. Key adaptations in teaching resource include:

Classroom constraints

* Large class size – consider smaller groups or have discussions in pairs;
* Time available – shorten or lengthen the duration of activities;
* Modifying materials needed – find, make or substitute required materials;
* Space requirements – reorganize classroom, use a larger space, move indoors or outdoors.

Cultural familiarity

* Change references to names, food and items to make them more familiar;
* Substitute local texts or art (folklore, stories, songs, games, artwork and proverbs).

Local relevance

* Use the names and processes for local institutions such as courts;
* Be sensitive of local behavior norms (e.g. for genders and ages);
* Ensure content is sensitive to the degree of rule of law in society (trust in authorities and institutions).

Inclusivity for diverse students

* Appropriate reading level(s) of texts for student use;
* Activities for different learning styles;
* Accommodation for students with special educational needs;
* Sensitivity to cultural, ethnic and linguistic diversity;
* Sensitivity to students&#x27; socioeconomic status.

==Pedagogical approaches==

=== Evidence-based ===
===Dialogic learning===

Dialogic learning is learning that takes place through dialogue. It is typically the result of egalitarian dialogue; in other words, the consequence of a dialogue in which different people provide arguments based on validity claims and not on power claims.

===Student-centered learning===

Student-centered learning, also known as learner-centered education, broadly encompasses methods of teaching that shift the focus of instruction from the teacher to the student. In original usage, student-centered learning aims to develop learner autonomy and independence by putting responsibility for the learning path in the hands of students. Student-centered instruction focuses on skills and practices that enable lifelong learning and independent problem-solving.

===Critical pedagogy===

Critical pedagogy applies critical theory to pedagogy and asserts that educational practices are contested and shaped by history, that schools are not politically neutral spaces, and that teaching is political. Decisions regarding the curriculum, disciplinary practices, student testing, textbook selection, the language used by the teacher, and more can empower or disempower students. It asserts that educational practices favor some students over others and some practices harm all students. It also asserts that educational practices often favor some voices and perspectives while marginalizing or ignoring others.

==Academic degrees==
The academic degree Ped. D., Doctor of Pedagogy, is awarded honorarily by some US universities to distinguished teachers (in the US and UK, earned degrees within the instructive field are classified as an Ed.D., Doctor of Education, or a Ph.D., Doctor of Philosophy). The term is also used to denote an emphasis in education as a specialty in a field (for instance, a Doctor of Music degree in piano pedagogy).

==Pedagogues around the world ==
The education of pedagogues, and their role in society, varies greatly from culture to culture.

=== Belgium ===
Important pedagogues in Belgium are Jan Masschelein and Maarten Simons (Catholic University of Leuven). According to these scholars, schools nowadays are often dismissed as outdated or ineffective. Deschoolers even argue that schools rest on the false premise that schools are necessary for learning but that people learn faster or better outside the classroom. Others critique the fact that some teachers stand before a classroom with only six weeks of teacher education. Against this background, Masschelein and Simons propose to look at school from a different point of view. Their educational morphology approaches the school as a particular scholastic &#x27;form of gathering&#x27;. What the authors mean with that, is the following: school is a particular time-space-matter arrangement. This thus includes concretes architectures, technologies, practices and figures. This arrangement &quot;deals in a specific way with the new generation, allows for a particular relation to the world, and for a particular experience of potentiality and of commonality (of making things public)&quot;.

Masschelein and Simons&#x27; most famous work is the book &quot;Looking after school: a critical analysis of personalisation in Education&quot;. It takes a critical look at the main discourse of today&#x27;s education. Education is seen through a socio-economic lens: education is aimed at mobilising talents and competencies (p23). This is seen in multiple texts from governing bodies, in Belgium and Europe. One of the most significant examples is quoted on page 23:  &quot;Education and training can only contribute to growth and job-creation if learning is focused on the knowledge, skills and competences to be acquired by students (learning outcomes) through the learning process, rather than on completing a specific stage or on time spent in school.&quot; (European Commission, 2012, p.7) This is, according to Masschelein and Simons a plea for learning outcomes and demonstrates a vision of education in which the institution is no longer the point of departure. The main ambition in this discourse of education is the efficient and effective realisation of learning outcomes for all. Things like the place and time of learning, didactic and pedagogic support are means to an end: the acquisition of preplanned learning outcomes. And these outcomes are a direct input for the knowledge economy. Masschelein and Simons&#x27; main critique here is that the main concern is not the educational institution (anymore). Rather, the focus lies on the learning processes and mainly on the learning outcomes of the individual learner.  

=== Brazil ===

In Brazil, a pedagogue is a multidisciplinary educator. Undergraduate education in Pedagogy qualifies students to become school administrators or coordinators at all educational levels, and also to become multidisciplinary teachers, such as pre-school, elementary and special teachers.

=== Denmark ===
In Scandinavia, a pedagogue (&quot;pædagog&quot;) is broadly speaking a practitioner of pedagogy, but the term is primarily reserved for individuals who occupy jobs in pre-school education (such as kindergartens and nurseries). A pedagogue can occupy various kinds of jobs, within this restrictive definition, e.g. in retirement homes, prisons, orphanages, and human resource management. When working with at-risk families or youths they are referred to as social pedagogues (&quot;socialpædagog&quot;).

The pedagogue&#x27;s job is usually distinguished from a teacher&#x27;s by primarily focusing on teaching children life-preparing knowledge such as social or non-curriculum skills, and cultural norms. There is also a very big focus on the care and well-being of the child. Many pedagogical institutions also practice social inclusion. The pedagogue&#x27;s work also consists of supporting the child in their mental and social development.

In Denmark all pedagogues are educated at a series of national institutes for social educators located in all major cities. The education is a 3.5-year academic course, giving the student the title of a Bachelor in Social Education (Danish: &quot;Professionsbachelor som pædagog&quot;).

It is also possible to earn a master&#x27;s degree in pedagogy/educational science from the University of Copenhagen. This BA and MA program has a more theoretical focus compared to the more vocational Bachelor in Social Education.

===Hungary===
In Hungary, the word pedagogue (&quot;pedagógus&quot;) is synonymous with the teacher (&quot;tanár&quot;); therefore, teachers of both primary and secondary schools may be referred to as pedagogues, a word that appears also in the name of their lobbyist organizations and labor unions (e.g. Labor Union of Pedagogues, Democratic Labor Union of Pedagogues). However, undergraduate education in Pedagogy does not qualify students to become teachers in primary or secondary schools but makes them able to apply to be educational assistants. As of 2013, the six-year training period was re-installed in place of the undergraduate and postgraduate division which characterized the previous practice.

==Modern pedagogy==
An article from Kathmandu Post published on 3 June 2018 described the usual first day of school in an academic calendar. Teachers meet their students with distinct traits. The diversity of attributions among children or teens exceeds similarities. Educators have to teach students with different cultural, social, and religious backgrounds. This situation entails a differentiated strategy in pedagogy and not the traditional approach for teachers to accomplish goals efficiently.

American author and educator Carol Ann Tomlinson defined Differentiated Instruction as &quot;teachers&#x27; efforts in responding to inconsistencies among students in the classroom.&quot; Differentiation refers to methods of teaching. She explained that Differentiated Instruction gives learners a variety of alternatives for acquiring information. Primary principles comprising the structure of Differentiated Instruction include formative and ongoing assessment, group collaboration, recognition of students&#x27; diverse levels of knowledge, problem-solving, and choice in reading and writing experiences.

Howard Gardner gained prominence in the education sector for his Multiple Intelligences Theory. He named seven of these intelligences in 1983: Linguistic, Logical and Mathematical, Visual and Spatial, Body and Kinesthetic, Musical and Rhythmic, Intrapersonal, and Interpersonal. Critics say the theory is based only on Gardner&#x27;s intuition instead of empirical data. Another criticism is that the intelligence is too identical for types of personalities. The theory of Howard Gardner came from cognitive research and states these intelligences help people to &quot;&quot;know the world, understand themselves, and other people&quot;.&quot; Said differences dispute an educational system that presumes students can &quot;&quot;understand the same materials in the same manner and that a standardized, collective measure is very much impartial towards linguistic approaches in instruction and assessment as well as to some extent logical and quantitative styles&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="419688" wikidata="Q2295262" url="?curid=419688" title="Lady Liberty (film)">
<text>Lady Liberty () is a 1971 Italian-French comedy film directed by Mario Monicelli, and starring Sophia Loren, William Devane, Gigi Proietti, Susan Sarandon, Danny DeVito and Edward Herrmann in his film debut.

It was shot at the Cinecittà Studios in Rome and on location in Emilia-Romagna and New York. The film&#x27;s sets were designed by the art director Mario Garbuglia.

==Plot summary==
Maddalena Ciarrapico arrives in New York City from Italy to get married and brings her fiancé a gift of mortadella (large Italian pork sausage) from her co-workers at the sausage factory where she used to work. But she is refused permission to bring the mortadella into the country because of the ban on meat which may contain food-borne diseases. An indignant Maddalena refuses to hand the sausage over, staying in the customs office at the airport, sparking a diplomatic incident in which she attracts widespread sympathy and support.

==Cast==
* Sophia Loren as Maddalena Ciarrapico
* William Devane as Jock Fenner
* Gigi Proietti as Michael Bruni
* Beeson Carroll as Dominic
* David Doyle as O&#x27;Henry
* Danny DeVito as Fred Mancuso
* Susan Sarandon as Sally

==Soundtrack==
A song by Harry Nilsson, &quot;I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City,&quot; was included in the movie.

==Reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; was scathing in its review of the film, observing that &quot;Probably no other woman has so triumphantly survived as many rotten movies in such a short space of time as Sophia Loren.&quot; Although &quot;the farcical premise is promising&quot; it was &quot;a comedy that manages to be both too serious and not serious enough and that, at no point matches the level of the humor and intelligence of its principal performance&quot;. It also questioned &quot;the grindingly bleak New York settings in which so much of the film is set&quot;.

<doc id="419690" wikidata="Q5115734" url="?curid=419690" title="Chuck Swindoll">
<text>Charles Rozell Swindoll (born October 18, 1934) is an evangelical Christian pastor, author, educator, and radio preacher. He founded Insight for Living, headquartered in Frisco, Texas, which airs a radio program of the same name on more than 2,000 stations around the world in 15 languages. He is currently the Founding Pastor at Stonebriar Community Church, in Frisco, Texas, and also sits on their elder board.

==Early life==
Charles Rozell Swindoll was born on October 18, 1934, in El Campo in Wharton County, Texas, the third of three children born to Earl and Lovell Swindoll. He attended Charles H. Milby High School in Houston. He credits his drama teacher, Dick Nieme, for helping him manage his stutter. As a member of the school marching band and orchestra, he learned to play all of the instruments in the woodwind section, although the clarinet remained his primary instrument. After graduating from high school, he studied mechanical engineering while working for Reed Roller Bit Company in Houston, Texas. Swindoll then fulfilled his military service obligation with the United States Marine Corps, first in San Francisco, then on the Japanese island of Okinawa. Part of his duty included playing in the Marine Corps Marching Band.

After his honorable discharge in 1959, he attended Dallas Theological Seminary, where he graduated magna cum laude four years later.

==Career==
Swindoll was ordained into the ministry in 1963 and served in Dallas at Grace Bible Church under J. Dwight Pentecost for two years. He has since held senior pastorates in Waltham, Massachusetts (1965–67), Irving, Texas (1967–71), and Fullerton, California (1971–94). He started his current senior pastorate in Frisco, Texas, in 1998.

Swindoll is the founder of Insight for Living, which broadcasts a radio program of the same name on Christian and non-Christian radio stations around the world. The program is heard on more than 2,000 stations, as well as being webcast, and is translated into several languages. Its roots go back to the summer of 1977, when Swindoll&#x27;s sermons from the First Evangelical Free Church in Fullerton were broadcast on radio. In 1979, the Insight for Living radio ministry began; its offices are now located in Frisco.

In July 1994, Swindoll became the president of Dallas Theological Seminary, and now serves as its chancellor. He is the author of more than 70 books, most of which are based on his research and preparation for sermons preached each Sunday. In celebration of the magazine&#x27;s 50th anniversary, &quot;Christianity Today&quot; produced an article naming Swindoll as one of the top 25 most influential preachers of the past 50 years (1956–2006).

In 1998 Swindoll founded Stonebriar Community Church in Frisco. Many of the pastors at Stonebriar are graduates of Dallas Theological Seminary. The church first held services at Collin County Community College (now Collin College), then moved to its permanent home on Legendary Drive. The grew rapidly from a few hundred members to several thousand in the first few years, and this growth has necessitated major expansion of the current facility. Construction for the additions began in 2005. The church is known for its missionary work in India and in other countries. Though Swindoll is still widely regarded as an Evangelical Free Church of America preacher, the Stonebriar Community Church is not affiliated with any particular denomination. In April 2024, Swindoll announced that he would step down as senior pastor, effective May 1, but would continue preaching at Stonebriar.

==Personal life==
On June 18, 1955, Swindoll married Cynthia Ann Parker, who used to be the pianist at a Baptist church in Galena Park, Texas. Together, the couple has four children, ten grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.

<doc id="419691" wikidata="Q7617637" url="?curid=419691" title="Stitch and glue">
<text>Stitch and glue is a simple boat building method which uses plywood panels temporarily stitched together, typically with wire or zip-ties, and glued together permanently with epoxy resin. This type of construction can eliminate much of the need for frames or ribs. Plywood panels are cut to shape and stitched together to form an accurate hull shape without the need for forms or special tools. This technique is also called &quot;tack and tape&quot;, or &quot;stitch and tape&quot;. Seams are reinforced with fiberglass tape and thickened epoxy.

==History==
The stitch and glue method was developed by woodwork teacher Ken Littledyke for the manufacture of canoes, later sold as the &#x27;Kayel&#x27; in plan and kit form, using plywood panels joined by fiberglass tape and resin. The technique was then popularised by the first TV do it yourself (DIY) expert, Barry Bucknell, in about 1964. 

The method was adopted, substituting copper wire ties rather than fishing line as in the early Littledyke examples, for the construction of the Mirror Dinghy in 1962. The Mirror is so named because the design was sponsored by &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; newspaper, a fact reflected by the historically red sails. &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; apparently wanted to bring cheap sailing to the masses. As such, unlike other construction techniques of the day, which required specialist skills and tools, stitch and glue was supposed to put boat-building within the reach of the average member of the public.

Although stitch and glue is similar to a traditional form of boatbuilding from northern Europe, particularly Lapland, called &quot;sewn boats&quot;, it is not known if Littledyke&#x27;s development of the stitch and glue methods was influenced by that technique.

In the United States stitch and glue boat building was popularized in the mid-1980s largely through Harold &quot;Dynamite&quot; Payson&#x27;s articles in &quot;WoodenBoat&quot; magazine and books on building &quot;instant boats&quot; designed by Phil Bolger. These boats were constructed of plywood with seams filleted with fiberglass tape and could be built by DIY amateurs of modest skill and relatively meagre resources.

==Technique==

The technique consists of stitching together plywood panels with some sort of wire or other suitable device, such as cable ties or duct tape and staples. All these methods of stitching or suturing the plywood panels of the hull are simple methods of clamping the hull parts together before they are permanently welded or fused by epoxy and fiberglass tape joints. Once the epoxy sets solid in most cases the stitches or other clamping structures are removed leaving only the fused plywood panels behind. Copper wire is popular because the wires can be twisted tighter or looser to precisely adjust fit, and because it is easy to sand after gluing, and it is suitable in a marine environment if left in place, but mild steel electric fencing wire can be used just as easily and then can be removed completely from the hull structure. To join, the cut panels are drilled with small holes along the joining edges and stitched. Once together, the joint is glued, usually with thickened epoxy and fiberglass on the inside of the hull.

On the outside of the hull, the wire is snipped and the joints filled and sanded over. The outside of the joint, or entire hull, may be fiberglassed and glued as well, providing additional strength. The combination of fiberglass tape and epoxy glue results in a composite material providing an extremely strong joint, something close to 8-10 times the strength of fastenings and timber framing that might have been used in more conventional plywood construction.

An alternative is to use dabs of thickened epoxy in between the &quot;stitching&quot; to join the panels, and after it has cured, completely remove the wire stitches instead of just snipping them off on the outside. With the wires removed, a fillet of thickened epoxy is applied over the entire length of the joint.

True stitch and glue designs generally have few bulkheads, relying instead on the geometry of the panels to provide shape, and forming a monocoque or semi-monocoque structure. But larger stitch and glue boats may have many athwart ship (sideways) or longitudinal (lengthwise) bulkheads in effect egg crating the interior with these members also fused into the final structure with the same type of glass tape and epoxy joints as the major hull seams.

==Spread of the technique==
Stitch and glue has become one of the dominant techniques in amateur boatbuilding. While the use of relatively few plywood panels (which minimizes the joints and makes the construction easier and faster) limits the shapes possible, the simplicity and low cost of the stitch and glue technique makes it the method of choice among most amateur boatbuilders. Simple software CAD packages are available for designing stitch and glue boats, and there are many Internet bulletin boards, newsgroups, and mailing lists dedicated to the subject of stitch and glue boats and various popular stitch and glue designs. Stitch and glue is not inherently limited to small designs though, as demonstrated by the boats made by Sam Devlin, who has applied the technique to making boats as long as 65 feet.

The &quot;Instant Boats&quot; developed by Phil Bolger use simplified framing and stitch-and-glue style plywood sheet joining and bulkhead gluing. Step-by-step building books about the boats and plans for many were sold by Harold Payson of Thomaston, Maine. They range from very small dinghies to power and sailboats 25 to 30 feet long. They are not necessarily designed for light weight, but like the original Mirror Dinghy, for simple construction. The plans predate CAD panel development software so the shapes are extremely simple in some cases.

===The &quot;one sheet boat&quot;===
The &quot;one sheet boat&quot; (&quot;OSB&quot;, cf. oriented strand board) is an outgrowth of the stitch and glue technique. The OSB is a boat that can be built using a single sheet of 4 foot by 8 foot plywood (1.22 m × 2.44 m). Some additional wood is often used, for supports, chines, or as a transom, though some can be built entirely with the sheet of plywood. OSBs tend to be very small, since the displacement is limited to a theoretical maximum of about 1500 lb (680 kg), based on the largest hemispherical shape that could be formed with the same surface area as the sheet of plywood. Though forming a hemisphere is possible (see geodesic dome), it is only practical for one person, since most designs have a maximum displacements of under 1000 lb (450 kg).

<doc id="419692" wikidata="Q5636337" url="?curid=419692" title="Kenshin Dragon Quest">
<text>is an all-in-one television game created by Square Enix, based on the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; video game series that connects to a person&#x27;s television set and does not require a separate video game console.

== Gameplay and features ==

In order to play, the player uses a toy sword as their game controller to walk (by pointing forward), to fight off monsters, defend with your shield, cast spells, and for every other input needed by the system. Slashing the sword in different directions (horizontal, diagonal, vertical) by the player will cause different effects and damage to enemies encountered in the game world. The game&#x27;s ROM is located on an item that resembles a shield. To save a game in process, the person must use a memory card that looks like a book, which is inserted into the shield.

This game is classified as Adventure, and not a traditional Role-playing game. This is because most of the game is set on a predetermined path that you can only travel in one direction, with few exceptions of side paths. Enemy encounters are set at predetermined locations and formations. This is in contrast to a Role-playing game focusing on dungeon crawling and open exploration.

The monsters encountered are the standard variety from &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; titles, including slimes, moles and skeleton knights. There are special bosses that reside at the end of each chapter. As the player builds up successful attacks and blocks with their shield, they build up a super meter. When this is completed, the player is enabled to unleash a powerful attack.

== Plot ==
&quot;Kenshin Dragon Quest&quot; takes place in the world of Alefgard, the same world as the first &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. The quest explores areas similar to the main storyline from &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. The main quest goals are saving Princess Laura and defeating the evil King Dragon, all while using the Erdrick&#x27;s Sword.

The quest is broken into eight chapters that take you throughout all of the locations in Alefgard, many being the same as in &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. Eventually, the hero will put together the same rainbow bridge as in &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, before he makes his way into the final castle, where he faces off against the King Dragon. The game includes a few mini-games, including a Slime Crisis game that would later be seen in &quot;Dragon Quest Swords: The Masked Queen and the Tower of Mirrors&quot;.

== Reception ==
Over 300,000 pre-orders of &quot;Kenshin Dragon Quest&quot; were made prior to the game&#x27;s release in Japan. By the close of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2004, more than half a million units of the game were shipped in Japan. The game was presented with a Special Award at the 8th Annual CESA Game Awards in 2004.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Kenshin&#x27;s&quot; spiritual sequel is &quot;Dragon Quest Swords: The Masked Queen and the Tower of Mirrors&quot;, which uses the Wii Remote as a controller instead of a sword. The game&#x27;s XaviX processor and sensor technologies were also used in other standalone video games, including Tiger Electronics&#x27; &quot;The Lord of the Rings: Warrior of Middle Earth&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Star Wars Saga Edition Lightsaber Battle Game&quot;.

<text>Wotton Underwood is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England, north of Thame, Oxfordshire.

The toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;farm near a wood&quot;. It is recorded in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; of AD 848 as &quot;Wudotun&quot; and in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Oltone&quot;. The affix &quot;Underwood&quot; was added later to distinguish the village from other places also called Wotton. The affix means &quot;near the wood&quot; and refers to the village&#x27;s nearness to the ancient Bernwood Forest.

The present manor house in the village, Wotton House, dates from the early eighteenth century, but has been much altered since, notably by John Soane in the 1820s. The former stables, now called South Pavilion, was the home of actor Sir John Gielgud; it was bought by Tony and Cherie Blair for £4m, in 2008.

==Church==
The parish church of All Saints is a Grade II* listed building, with parts dating from the 12th century: it was largely rebuilt in 1867 by G. E. Street for the Duke of Buckingham. The South aisle contains several monuments to members of the Grenville family, who were lords of the manor from the 12th to the 18th century. There are also monuments to Richard, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos (d. 1889), and his wife Caroline, Duchess of Buckingham and Chandos (d. 1874).

All Saints&#x27;s Church is a member of the Bernwode Benefice of the Church of England, which covers Wotton Underwood, along with the village parishes of Ashendon, Boarstall, Brill, Chilton, Dorton, and Ludgershall. 

==Railways==
The Brill Tramway, originally known as the Wotton Tramway and, from 1899, part of the Metropolitan Railway, which served the area, had a station named Wotton which closed in 1935 with the rest of the line.

The Great Central Railway built a line from Grendon Underwood to Princes Risborough, and upon that opened a station at Wotton in 1906; this closed in 1953.

==Geography==
The parish is on a mid-height escarpment of the outer Chiltern Hills and has an irregular shape generally bounded by headwaters. It includes a southern thin projection skirting Ashendon. Two streams rise just outside the area and flow into the south-centre from west and east and then flow north. Its relatively small area and low population itself was reduced by an enclosure act - see Wotton House. In 1821 its population reached 344 residents, which has not been exceeded since. Otherwise bereft of woods and lakes, the west part has two lakes and the Warrens, an area of woodland laid out by Wotton House. The number of houses fell from 73 in 1951 to 42 ten years later.

==Notable residents==
* The Dukes of Buckingham and Chandos
* William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville
* Sir John Gielgud
* Tony Blair

<text>Nicholas is a male name, the Anglophone version of an ancient Greek name in use since antiquity, and cognate with the modern Greek , . It originally derived from a combination of two Greek words meaning &#x27;victory&#x27; and &#x27;people&#x27;. In turn, the name means &quot;victory of the people.&quot;

The name has been widely used in countries with significant Christian populations, owing in part to the veneration of Saint Nicholas, which became increasingly prominent in Western Europe from the 11th century. Revered as a saint in many Christian denominations, the Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, and Anglican Churches all celebrate Saint Nicholas Day on December 6. In maritime regions throughout Europe, the name and its derivatives have been especially popular, as St Nicholas is considered the protector saint of seafarers. This remains particularly so in Greece, where St Nicholas is the patron saint of the Hellenic Navy.

== Origins ==
The name derives from the . It is understood to mean &#x27;victory of the people&#x27;, being a compound of two Greek words, , &#x27;victory&#x27; and , &#x27;people&#x27;. An ancient paretymology (a false etymology) of the latter element, , is that it originates from , (a contracted form of , ), meaning &#x27;stone&#x27; or &#x27;rock&#x27;. This is in reference to the story of Deucalion and Pyrrha from Greek mythology. As the sole survivors of a catastrophic deluge, they were able to repopulate the world by throwing stones behind them, over their shoulders, while they kept marching on. The stones formed men and women where they landed.
The name became popular through Saint Nicholas, Bishop of Myra in Lycia, the inspiration for Santa Claus, but it predates said bishop by several centuries: the Athenian historian Thucydides for example, mentions that in the second year of the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC) between Sparta and Athens, the Spartans sent a delegation to the Persian king to ask for his help to fight the Athenians; a certain Nikolaos was one of the delegates.

The customary English spelling &quot;Nicholas&quot;, using a &quot;ch&quot;, as though the word were spelled in Greek with a chi, first came into use in the 12th century and has been firmly established since the Reformation, although the spelling &quot;Nicolas&quot; is occasionally used.

In Scotland, until the late nineteenth century, fishing communities used Nicholas as a female name.

<text>, 22 languages have been classified as recognised languages under the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India. There is no national language of India.

While the constitution was adopted in 1950, article 343 declared that Hindi would be the official language and English would serve as an additional official language for a period not exceeding 15 years. Article 344(1) defined a set of 14 regional languages which were represented in the Official Languages Commission. The commission was to suggest steps to be taken to progressively promote the use of Hindi as the official language of the country. The Official Languages Act, 1963 which came into effect on 26 January 1965, made provision for the continuation of English as an official language alongside Hindi.

== History ==
The official languages of British India before independence were English, Standard Urdu and later Modern Standard Hindi, with English being used for purposes at the central level. The origins of official Hindi usage traces back to the late 19th century. In 1881, Hindi replaced Urdu as the official language of Bihar; and in 1900, MacDonnell issued an order, which allowed the “permissive — but not exclusive — use” of Devanagari for Hindustani language in the courts of North-Western Provinces.

Following independence, the Constituent Assembly remained divided on the language issue, with some like R. V. Dulekar and Seth Govind Das favouring declaring Hindi written in Devanagari the national language of India immediately, while within the camp favouring Hindi there were divisions over whether the script of the language should be Devanagari or Roman, whether Hindustani with both Devanagari and Urdu scripts be retained, and whether the numerals should be international or Devanagari. Meanwhile, some like Frank Anthony, T A Ramalingam Chettiar, and Naziruddin Ahmad wanted to continue the usage of English, while Nehru, although supporting the dropping of English as an official language in favour of Hindi/Hindustani, cautioned against forcefully doing so in face of opposition in the South. The Indian constitution, adopted in 1950, as a compromise envisaged that English would be phased out in favour of Hindi over a fifteen-year period, but gave Parliament the power to, by law, provide for the continued use of English even thereafter.

Plans to make Hindi the sole official language of the Republic were met with resistance in many parts of the country, especially in Tamil Nadu, which had a history of opposing imposition of the Hindi language dating back to 1937, when the Justice Party opposed the then Congress led Madras Government&#x27;s decision to make Hindi compulsory in secondary/middle schools.

The Indian constitution, in 1950, declared Hindi in Devanagari script to be the official language of the union. Unless Parliament decided otherwise, the use of English for official purposes was to cease 15 years after the constitution came into effect, that is, on 26 January 1965. The prospect of the changeover, however, led to much alarm in the non-Hindi-speaking areas of India, especially Dravidian-speaking states whose languages were not related to Hindi at all. As a result, Parliament enacted the , which provided for the continued use of English for official purposes along with Hindi, even after 1965. 

In late 1964, an attempt was made to expressly provide for an end to the use of English, but it was met with protests from states and territories, including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, West Bengal, Karnataka, Puducherry, Nagaland, Mizoram and Andhra Pradesh. Some of these protests also turned violent. As a result, the proposal was dropped, and the Act itself was amended in 1967 to provide that the use of English would not be ended until a resolution to that effect was passed by the legislature of every state that had not adopted Hindi as its official language, and by each house of the Indian Parliament.

The position was thus that the Union government continues to use English in addition to Hindi for its official purposes as a &quot;subsidiary official language&quot;, but is also required to prepare and execute a program to progressively increase its use of Hindi.The exact extent to which, and the areas in which, the Union government uses Hindi and English, respectively, is determined by the provisions of the Constitution, the Official Languages Act, 1963, the Official Languages Rules, 1976, and statutory instruments made by the Department of Official Language under these laws.

Department of Official Language was set up in June 1975 as an independent Department of the Ministry of Home Affairs.

== Scheduled languages of the Indian Constitution ==

The Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India lists the official languages of the Republic of India. At the time when the Constitution was enacted, inclusion in this list meant that the language was entitled to representation on the Official Languages Commission, and that the language would be one of the bases that would be drawn upon to enrich Hindi and English, the official languages of the Union. The list has since, however, acquired further significance. The Government of India is now under an obligation to take measures for the development of these languages, such that &quot;they grow rapidly in richness and become effective means of communicating modern knowledge.&quot; In addition, candidates sitting for an examination conducted for public service are entitled to use any of these languages as a medium to answer the paper.

=== Chronology ===

* 1950: 14 languages were initially included in the Constitution.
* 1967: Sindhi was added by 21st Constitutional Amendment Act.
* 1992: Konkani, Manipuri and Nepali were added by 71st Constitutional Amendment Act
* 2003: Bodo, Dogri, Maithili and Santali were added by 92nd Constitutional Amendment Act.
* 2011: The spelling Oriya was replaced by Odia by 96th Constitutional Amendment Act.


==Official languages of the Union==
=== Parliamentary proceedings and laws ===
The Indian constitution distinguishes the language to be used in Parliamentary proceedings, and the language in which laws are to be made. Parliamentary business, according to the Constitution, may be conducted in either Hindi or English. The use of English in parliamentary proceedings was to be phased out at the end of fifteen years unless Parliament chose to extend its use, which Parliament did through the Official Languages Act, 1963. Also, the constitution permits a person who is unable to express themself in either Hindi or English to, with the permission of the Speaker of the relevant House, address the House in their mother tongue.

In contrast, the constitution requires the authoritative text of all laws, including Parliamentary enactments and statutory instruments, to be in English, until Parliament decides otherwise. Parliament has not exercised its power to so decide, instead merely requiring that all such laws and instruments, and all bills brought before it, also be translated into Hindi, though the English text remains authoritative. The Official Languages Act, 1963 provides that the authoritative text of central acts, rules, regulations, etc., are published in Hindi as well in the official gazette by President of India.

=== Judiciary ===
The constitution provides, and the Supreme Court of India has reiterated, that all proceedings in the Supreme Court and the High Courts shall be in English. Parliament has the power to alter this by law but has not done so. However, in many high courts, there is, with consent from the president, allowance of the optional use of Hindi. Such proposals have been successful in the states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar.

=== Administration ===
The Official Language Act provides that the Union government shall use both Hindi and English in most administrative documents that are intended for the public, though the Union government is required by law to promote the use of Hindi names, among others, resolutions, general orders, rules, notifications, administrative or other reports or press communiques issued by a government department, agency or corporation; administrative and other reports and official papers laid before a House or the Houses of Parliament; and contracts and agreements executed, and licences, permits, notices and forms of tender issued by or on behalf of the government (including government companies). The Official Languages Rules, in contrast, provide for a higher degree of use of Hindi in communications between offices of the central government (other than offices in Tamil Nadu, to which the rules do not apply). Communications between different departments within the central government may be in English and Hindi (though the English text remains authoritative), although a translation into the other language must be provided if required. Communications within offices of the same department, however, must be in Hindi if the offices are in Hindi-speaking states, and in either Hindi or English otherwise with Hindi being used in proportion to the percentage of staff in the receiving office who have a working knowledge of Hindi. Notes and memos in files may be in English and Hindi (though the English text remains authoritative), with the Government having a duty to provide a translation into the other language if required.

Besides, every person submitting a petition for the redress of a grievance to a government officer or authority has a constitutional right to submit it in any language used in India.

*12 out of the 22 scheduled languages are made available in the official website of the Indian Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, namely Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Meitei (Manipuri), Odia, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu, in addition to English.
* 15 out of the 22 scheduled languages are made available in the Press Information Bureau (PIB) by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting of the Government of India (GOI), namely Assamese, Bengali, Dogri, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Konkani, Malayalam, Marathi, Meitei (Manipuri), Odia, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu, in addition to English.
* 14 out of the 22 scheduled languages are selected by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) of the Government of India, to be made available in the conduction of the Multi-Tasking (Non-Technical) Staff examination across the country, namely Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Konkani, Malayalam, Marathi, Meitei (Manipuri), Odia, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu, in addition to English.

===Implementation===
Various steps have been taken by the Indian government to implement the use and familiarisation of Hindi extensively. Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha headquartered at Chennai was formed to spread Hindi in South Indian states. Regional Hindi implementation offices at Bangalore, Thiruvananthapuram, Mumbai, Kolkata, Guwahati, Bhopal, Delhi and Ghaziabad have been established to monitor the implementation of Hindi in Central government offices and PSUs.

Annual targets are set by the Department of Official Language regarding the amount of correspondence being carried out in Hindi. A Parliament Committee on Official Language constituted in 1976 periodically reviews the progress in the use of Hindi and submits a report to the President. The governmental body which makes policy decisions and established guidelines for the promotion of Hindi is the &quot;Kendriya Hindi Samiti&quot; (est. 1967). In every city that has more than ten central Government offices, a Town Official Language Implementation Committee is established and cash awards are given to government employees who write books in Hindi. All Central government offices and PSUs are to establish Hindi Cells for implementation of Hindi in their offices.

In 2016, the government announced plans to promote Hindi in government offices in Southern and Northeast India.

The Indian constitution does not specify the official languages to be used by the states for the conduct of their official functions and leaves each state free to, through its legislature, adopt Hindi or any language used in its territory as its official language or languages. The language need not be one of those listed in the Eighth Schedule, and several states have adopted official languages which are not so listed. Examples include Kokborok in Tripura and Mizo in Mizoram.

=== Legislature and administration ===
The constitutional provisions in relation to use of the official language in legislation at the State level largely mirror those relating to the official language at the central level, with minor variations. State legislatures may conduct their business in their official language, Hindi or (for a transitional period, which the legislature can extend if it so chooses) English, and members who cannot use any of these have the same rights to their mother tongue with the Speaker&#x27;s permission. The authoritative text of all laws must be in English unless Parliament passes a law permitting a state to use another language, and if the original text of a law is in a different language, an authoritative English translation of all laws must be prepared.

The state has the right to regulate the use of its official language in public administration, and in general, neither the constitution nor any central enactment imposes any restriction on this right. However, every person submitting a petition for the redress of a grievance to any officer or authority of the state government has a constitutional right to submit it in any language used in that state, regardless of its official status.

Besides, the constitution grants the central government, acting through the President, the power to issue certain directives to the government of a state in relation to the use of minority languages for official purposes. The President may direct a State to officially recognise a language spoken in its territory for specified purposes and in specified regions if its speakers demand it and satisfy him that a substantial proportion of the State&#x27;s population desires its use. Similarly, States and local authorities are required to endeavour to provide primary education in the mother tongue for all linguistic minorities, regardless of whether their language is official in that State, and the President has the power to issue directions he deems necessary to ensure that they are provided these facilities.

=== State judiciary ===
States have significantly less freedom in relation to determining the language in which judicial proceedings in their respective High Courts will be conducted. The constitution gives the power to authorise the use of Hindi, or the state&#x27;s official language in proceedings of the High Court to the Governor, rather than the state legislature and requires the Governor to obtain the consent of the President of India, who in these matters acts on the advice of the Government of India. The Official Languages Act gives the Governor a similar power, subject to similar conditions, in relation to the language in which the High Court&#x27;s judgements will be delivered.

Four states—Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan— have been granted the right to conduct proceedings in their High Courts in their official language, which, for all of them, was Hindi. However, the only non-Hindi state to seek a similar power—Tamil Nadu, which sought the right to conduct proceedings in Tamil in the Madras High Court—had its application rejected by the central government earlier, which said it was advised to do so by the Supreme Court. In 2006, the law ministry said that it would not object to Tamil Nadu state&#x27;s desire to conduct Madras High Court proceedings in Tamil. In 2010, the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court allowed lawyers to argue cases in Tamil.

===Demands for additional official languages===
At present, as per the Ministry of Home Affairs, there are demands for inclusion of 38 more languages
in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution. These are: 
== Official status in states and territories ==
=== Official languages of States ===
In addition to official languages, a few states also designate official scripts. 
=== Official languages of Union Territories ===
&lt;section end=&quot;Lists of Official Languages of States and Union Territories of India&quot; /&gt;

== Union–state and interstate communication communication rules ==

The language of communications between different states or between the union government and a state or a person in a state, is regulated by the Official Languages Act and, except for communications involving Tamil Nadu, which are governed by the Official Languages Rules. Communication between states which have Hindi as an official language must be in Hindi, whereas communication between a state where Hindi is an official language and one where it is not Hindi and must be in English, or, in Hindi with an accompanying English translation (unless the receiving state agrees to dispense with the translation).

Communication between the union and states which use Hindi as their official language (classified by the Official Language Rules as &quot;the states in Region A&quot;), and with persons who live in those states, is generally in Hindi, except in certain cases. Communication with a second category of states &quot;Region B&quot;, which do not have Hindi as an official language but have elected to communicate with the union in Hindi is usually in Hindi, while communications &quot;sent&quot; to an individual in those states may be in Hindi and English. Communication with all other states &quot;Region C&quot;, and with people living in them, is in English.

Region A: Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Bihar, Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Communications from the Union are in Hindi.

Region B: Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Punjab. Communications from the Union are in Hindi and English.

Region C: Others. Communications from the Union are in English only.

== Arts and literature ==
* Best Feature Film in any of the scheduled languages are eligible for the National Film Awards.
* Literary works in any of the scheduled languages are eligible for the Sahitya Akademi Awards, the Sahitya Akademi Translation Prizes and the Sahitya Akademi Yuva Puraskar.
* People who contribute to the literature of any of the scheduled languages are eligible for the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship.

<doc id="419713" wikidata="Q718415" url="?curid=419713" title="Richard Russell Jr.">
<text>Richard Brevard Russell Jr. (November 2, 1897 – January 21, 1971) was an American politician. A Southern Democrat, he served as the 66th Governor of Georgia from 1931 to 1933 before serving in the United States Senate for almost 40 years, from 1933 to 1971. Russell was a founder and leader of the conservative coalition that dominated Congress from 1937 to 1963, and at his death was the most senior member of the Senate. He was a leader of Southern opposition to the civil rights movement for decades.

Born in Winder, Georgia, Russell established a legal practice in Winder after graduating from the University of Georgia School of Law. He served in the Georgia House of Representatives from 1921 to 1931 before becoming Governor of Georgia. Russell won a special election to succeed Senator William J. Harris and joined the Senate in 1933. He supported the New Deal in his Senate career but helped establish the conservative coalition of Southern Democrats. He was the chief sponsor of the National School Lunch Act, which provided free or low-cost school lunches to impoverished students.

During his long tenure in the Senate, Russell served as chairman of several committees, and was the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services for most of the period between 1951 and 1969. He was a candidate for President of the United States at the 1948 Democratic National Convention and the 1952 Democratic National Convention. He was also a member of the Warren Commission.

Russell supported racial segregation and co-authored the Southern Manifesto with Strom Thurmond. Russell and 17 fellow Democratic Senators, along with one Republican, blocked the passage of civil rights legislation via the filibuster. After Russell&#x27;s protégé, President Lyndon B. Johnson, signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law, Russell led a Southern boycott of the 1964 Democratic National Convention. Russell served in the Senate until his death from emphysema in 1971.

==Early life==
Richard B. Russell Jr. was born in 1897 as the first son of Georgia Supreme Court Chief Justice Richard B. Russell Sr. and Ina Dillard Russell. He eventually had a total of twelve adult siblings, as well as two who died before adolescence.

Throughout Russell Jr.&#x27;s childhood, his father made multiple attempts to run for higher political office. Though he was a well-liked state representative for Clarke County and a successful solicitor general for a seven-county circuit, he fared poorly in multiple attempts to become U.S. Senator for Georgia and Governor of Georgia. Due to his political failures, the Russell family lived below their financial means at times.

From an early age, the elder Russell trained his son to exceed his father&#x27;s legacy in the state. Due to the family&#x27;s loss of their ancestral plantation and mill during Sherman&#x27;s March, Russell spent much time studying Civil War history.

Russell enrolled in the University of Georgia School of Law in 1915 and earned a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree in 1918. While at UGA, he was a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society.

Dominated by white conservatives, Democrats controlled state government and the Congressional delegation. The Republican Party was no longer competitive, hollowed out in the state following the effective disenfranchisement of most blacks by Georgia&#x27;s approval of a constitutional amendment, effective in 1908, requiring a literacy test, but providing a &quot;grandfather clause&quot; to create exceptions for whites.

== Early political career ==
Following his time at college, Russell briefly worked at a law firm with his father before successfully running for the Georgia House of Representatives at the earliest opportunity. Six years into his tenure, Russell ran unopposed for the Speakership at the age of 29. His popularity among his legislator colleagues came from his perceived integrity and willingness to build coalitions.

==Governor of Georgia, 1931–1933==

Russell&#x27;s campaign for Governor was an untraditional one, it was not based in Atlanta and Russell at 33 would be the youngest Georgian Governor to that point when he was elected, but he did have the support of 90% of the state legislators.

As governor, Russell reorganized the bureaucracy, reducing the number of state agencies from 102 to 18, promoted economic development in the midst of the Great Depression, and balanced the state budget.

During Russell&#x27;s governorship, World War I veteran Robert Elliot Burns released the autobiography &quot;I Am A Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang!&quot;, which had previously been serialized in &quot;True Detective&quot; magazine and would become a popular Paul Muni film in November 1932. The book details the multiple stints Burns served in the Georgian penal system and his attempts to escape.

Following the release of the book and the film adaptation, Russell attempted to extradite Burns from the state of New Jersey so Burns could continue to serve his sentence. Russell denounced Burns&#x27; depictions of the horrific hard labor in his state, calling New Jersey Governor A. Harry Moore&#x27;s refusal to return Burns to Georgia &quot;a slander on the state of Georgia and its institutions.&quot;

==Senate career, 1933–1971==
===Electoral History===
Russell&#x27;s first campaign for the Senate was as a result of a special election in September 1932 after the death of William J. Harris. His opponent in the primary was Representative Charles Crisp, who was nicknamed &quot;Kilowatt Charlie&quot; due to his links to the unpopular Georgia Power Company.

In 1936, he defeated the former Democratic Governor Eugene Talmadge for the US Senate seat by defending the New Deal as good for Georgia.

===New Deal===
In 1933, when Russell came into the Senate, the Democrats had just ousted the Republicans as the major party and there were a number of important committees with vacancies. The number of vacancies and Russell&#x27;s populist reputation from his time as Governor and his primary campaign meant that he got his first choice, Appropriations, in order to stop him becoming a second Huey Long. Due to a feud between Carter Glass, the chairman of the Appropriations committee, and the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Ellison D. Smith, Russell became the chairman of that subcommittee. This gave Russell a lot of power over the funding of aid to farmers.

Russell supported the New Deal of President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression. Russell was elected on a moderately progressive platform, and supported bailout and aid programs for local governments. Once in the Senate, he became an ardent supporter of the Roosevelt administration and New Deal programs, and expressed his support for &quot;the fullest measure of relief that the combined resources of this commonwealth will afford.&quot; Russell endorsed almost every New Deal act during the &quot;Hundred Days&quot; Congress session; once a rift in the Democratic Party emerged in 1935, resulting in filibusters and deadlocks, Russell continued to support the President and the New Deal. Howard N. Mead observes that even &quot;when many other Southern politicians began to express some measure of discontent with the administration and its proposals, Russell remained firm in his support&quot;. When competing with conservative Talmadge for the Georgian Senate seat, Russell expressed his fervent support for income tax and social welfare, consistently praised the New Deal in his speeches, and attacked Talmadge for his fiscal conservatism.

Russell continued to be an outspoken economic progressive even after World War II, and was the main sponsor of the 1946 National School Lunch Act, which was named after him. He expanded and carried out projects to distribute surplus food of Georgia to poor families through food stamps and school lunch programs, and wished to tackle rural poverty. After the establishment of a national school lunch program, Russell continuously pushed for funding it further throughout 1950s and 1960s, and sought active promotion and implementation of Georgian foods such as peanuts in the program, and saw it as a way to promote the interests of Georgian farmers.

===Militarism===
During World War II, Russell was known for his uncompromising position toward Japan and its civilian casualties. In the late months of the war, he held that the US should not treat Japan with more leniency than Germany, and that the United States should not encourage Japan to sue for peace.

Russell was a prominent supporter of a strong national defense. He used his powers as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee from 1951 to 1969, and then as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee as an institutional base to gain defense installations and jobs for Georgia. He was dubious about the Vietnam War, privately warning President Johnson repeatedly against deeper involvement.

===Civil Rights Opposition===
Unlike Theodore Bilbo, &quot;Cotton Ed&quot; Smith, and James Eastland, who had reputations as ruthless, tough-talking, heavy-handed race baiters, Russell never justified hatred or acts of violence to defend segregation. But he strongly defended white supremacy and apparently did not question it or ever apologize for his segregationist views, votes and speeches. For decades Russell was a key figure in the Southern Caucus within the Senate that blocked or watered down meaningful civil rights legislation intended to protect African Americans from lynching, disenfranchisement, and disparate treatment under the law.

Russell strongly condemned President Truman&#x27;s pro-desegregation stance and wrote that he was &quot;sick at heart&quot; over it, but unlike most Southern Democrats such as Strom Thurmond, he did not walk out of the convention and support the Dixiecrats.

In 1952, Russell was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination; while he did not discuss civil rights while campaigning, his platform named &quot;local self-government&quot; one of the major &quot;Jeffersonian Principles&quot;. Russell claimed that the goal of his candidacy was to showcase the principles of &quot;Southern Democracy&quot; and to allow Southern Democrats to form a united front against the North. While he decisively defeated Estes Kefauver in the Florida primary, Russell was opposed by most of Democrats as he refused to support the civil rights plank of the party. Jim Rowe claimed that the sectional nature of the defeat shocked Russell and made him into a more parochial politician.

In early 1956, Russell&#x27;s office was continually used as a meeting place by the Southern Caucus, and he was through most of the caucus&#x27;s life the acknowledged leader of the group, sending out invitations to what he called &quot;Constitutional Democrats&quot;. The caucus included fellow senators such as Strom Thurmond, James Eastland, Allen Ellender, and John Stennis, the four having a commonality of being dispirited with &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, the 1954 ruling by the US Supreme Court that said that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.

Russell was one of the strongest opponents of every desegregation measure in the Senate, but he remained loyal to the party. Although he called the 1960 Democratic Party platform a &quot;complete surrender to the NAACP and the other extreme radicals at Los Angeles&quot;, he did agree to campaign for the Kennedy-Johnson ticket for the 1960 United States presidential election.

In January 1964, President Johnson delivered the 1964 State of the Union Address, calling for Congress to &quot;lift by legislation the bars of discrimination against those who seek entry into our country, particularly those who have much needed skills and those joining their families.&quot; Russell issued a statement afterward stating the commitment by Southern senators to oppose such a measure, which he called &quot;shortsighted and disastrous,&quot; while admitting the high probability of it passing. He added that the civil rights bill&#x27;s true intended effect was to intermingle races, eliminate states&#x27; rights, and abolish the checks and balances system.

After Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Russell (along with more than a dozen other southern Senators, including Herman Talmadge and Russell Long) boycotted the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City.

Although he had served as a prime mentor of Johnson, Russell and Johnson disagreed over civil rights. Johnson supported this as President. Russell, a segregationist, had repeatedly blocked and defeated federal civil rights legislation via use of the filibuster.

====Southern Moderate?====

Russell was considered to be moderate in his support for segregation; in 1936, he often attacked race-baiting, such as the claim that New Deal legislation would mostly benefit black people. W. J. Cash considered Russell &quot;the better sort of Southerner,&quot; as he was ready to call out &quot;ruffian appeals to race hatred&quot; made by others. James Thomas Gay claimed that Russell &quot;wished blacks no ill;&quot; in the 1950s, Russell corresponded with a black voter from Dublin, Georgia, Hercules Moore, who raised concerns that African-American children were being treated unfairly in the school lunch program, which was funded federally. Russell took the matter seriously and &quot;later gave Moore satisfactory evidence that the program was being properly administered for children of both races.&quot;.

===Abe Fortas Nomination===

Russell&#x27;s support for first-term senator Lyndon B. Johnson paved the way for Johnson to become Senate Majority Leader. Russell often dined at Johnson&#x27;s house during their Senate days. But, their 20-year friendship came to an end during Johnson&#x27;s presidency, in a fight over the 1968 nomination as Chief Justice of Abe Fortas, Johnson&#x27;s friend and Supreme Court justice.

In June 1968, Chief Justice Earl Warren announced his decision to retire. President Johnson afterward announced the nomination of Associate Justice Abe Fortas for the position. David Greenburg wrote that when Russell &quot;decided in early July to oppose Fortas, he brought most of his fellow Dixiecrats with him.&quot;

===Cold Warrior===
In May 1961, President John F. Kennedy requested Russell place the Presidential wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns during an appearance at Arlington National Cemetery for a Memorial Day ceremony.

Russell scheduled a closed door meeting for the Senate Armed Services Committee for August 31, 1961, at the time of Senator Strom Thurmond requesting the committee vote on whether to vote to investigate &quot;a conspiracy to muzzle military anti-Communist drives.&quot;

In late February 1963, the Senate Armed Services Committee was briefed by Defense Secretary Robert McNamara on policy in the Caribbean. Russell said afterward that he believed that American airmen would strike down foreign jets in international waters and only inquire on the aircraft&#x27;s purpose there afterward.

==Warren Commission==
From 1963 to 1964, Russell was one of the members of the Warren Commission, which was charged to investigate the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in November 1963. Originally Russell did not want to serve on the Warren Commission, telling President Lyndon B. Johnson that he didn&#x27;t like or have confidence in Earl Warren who was to head the commission.

Russell&#x27;s personal papers indicated that he was troubled by the Commission&#x27;s single-bullet theory, the Soviet Union&#x27;s failure to provide greater detail regarding Lee Harvey Oswald&#x27;s period in Russia, and the lack of information regarding Oswald&#x27;s Cuba-related activities.

In a January 1970 television interview, Russell stated that he accepted Oswald shot Kennedy but that he doubted he had acted alone, explaining that &quot;too many things caused me to doubt that he planned it all by himself&quot;. Russell had written a dissenting opinion for the Warren Commission that &quot;a number of suspicious circumstances&quot; could not allow him to agree that there was no conspiracy to kill Kennedy and that citing a lack of evidence he believed this &quot;preclude[d] the conclusive determination that Oswald and Oswald alone, without the knowledge, encouragement or assistance of any other person, planned and perpetrated the assassination&quot;. With Russell&#x27;s agreement this statement was not included in the final report.

==Legacy==
Russell was seen as a hero by many of the pro Jim Crow South. While undoubtedly a skilled politician of immense influence, his lifelong support of white supremacy has marred his legacy. Russell publicly said that America was &quot;a white man&#x27;s country, yes, and we are going to keep it that way.&quot; He also said he was vehemently opposed to &quot;political and social equality with the Negro.&quot; Russell also supported poll taxes across the South and called President Truman&#x27;s support of civil rights for black Americans an &quot;uncalled-for attack on our Southern civilization.&quot;

Russell has been honored by having the following named for him:

In 2020, former Georgia Board of Regents Chairman Sachin Shailendra and then Chancellor Steve Wrigley of the University System of Georgia tasked an advisory group to review the names of buildings and colleges across all campuses within the USG. Members of the advisory group consisted of Marion Fedrick, the tenth and current president of Albany State University in Albany, Georgia, Michael Patrick of Chick-fil-A, retired judge Herbert Phipps of the Georgia Court of Appeals, current chairman of the University of Georgia Foundation, Neal J. Quirk Sr., and Dr. Sally Wallace, the current dean of the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies of Georgia State University in Atlanta, Georgia.

Despite recommendations from the advisory group to rename all buildings associated with Russell, the Georgia Board of Regents did not move forward with any of the final recommendations from the advisory group&#x27;s report.

<text>Halton House is a country house in the Chiltern Hills above the village of Halton in Buckinghamshire, England. It was built for Alfred &quot;Freiherr&quot; de Rothschild between 1880 and 1883. It is used as the main officers&#x27; mess for RAF Halton and is listed Grade II* on the National Heritage List for England.

== History ==
There has been a manor house at Halton since the Norman Conquest, when it belonged to the Archbishop of Canterbury. Thomas Cranmer sold the manor to Henry Bradshaw, Solicitor-General in the mid-16th century. After remaining in the Bradshaw family for some considerable time, it was sold to Sir Francis Dashwood in 1720 and was then held in the Dashwood family for almost 150 years.

The site of the old Halton House, or Manor, was west of the church in Halton village. It had a large park, which was later bisected by the Grand Union Canal. In June 1849 Sir George Dashwood auctioned the contents and, in 1853, the estate was sold to Lionel &quot;Freiherr&quot; de Rothschild.

Lionel then left the estate to his son Alfred &quot;Freiherr&quot; de Rothschild in 1879. At this time the estate covered an approximately triangle between Wendover, Aston Clinton, and Weston Turville.

== Construction ==
It is thought the architect was William R. Rodriguez (also known as Rogers), who worked in the design team of William Cubitt and Company, the firm commissioned to build and oversee the project in 1880. Just three years later the house was finished.

The house was widely criticised by members of the establishment. The architect Eustace Balfour, a nephew of the Marquess of Salisbury, described it as a &quot;combination of French Chateau and gambling house&quot;, 
and one of Gladstone&#x27;s private secretaries called it an &quot;exaggerated nightmare&quot;.

== Sale to RAF ==
At Halton all were entertained by Alfred &quot;Freiherr&quot; de Rothschild. However, Halton&#x27;s glittering life lasted less than thirty years, with the last party being in 1914 at the outbreak of World War I. Devastated by the carnage of the war, &quot;Freiherr&quot; de Rothschild&#x27;s health began to fail and he died in 1918. Alfred had no legitimate children, so the house was bequeathed to his nephew Lionel Nathan de Rothschild. He detested the place and sold the contents at auction in 1918. The house and by now diminished estate were purchased for the Royal Air Force by the Air Ministry for what was even then a low price of £115,000 (equivalent to £ in pounds).

== Officers Mess==
Shortly after the RAF acquired the Halton estate, the house became RAF Halton&#x27;s officers mess. On 1 January 1920 RAF Halton was upgraded to a command and the headquarters element moved into Halton House. Although the House no longer functions as a headquarters, it remains an officers mess. A new dining room was built at the rear of the servants&#x27; wing of the house in the 1960s.

== Architecture ==
For the style of the house Alfred was probably influenced by that of plans for the nearly completed Waddesdon Manor, the home of Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild, his brother-in law. While not so large there is a resemblance, but other continental influences appear to have crept in: classical pediments jut from mansard roofs, spires and gables jostle for attention, and the whole is surmounted by a cupola. The front of the house features a porte-cochère. A Rothschild cousin described it as: &quot;looking like a giant wedding cake&quot;.

If the outside was extravagant, the interior was no anti-climax. The central hall (not unlike the galleried two-storey hall at Mentmore Towers) was furnished as the &quot;grand salon&quot;. Two further drawing rooms (the east and west) continued the luxurious theme. The dining and billiards rooms too were furnished with 18th-century panelling and boiseries. The theme continued up the grand, plaster panelled staircase to the bedrooms. The whole was furnished in what became known as &quot;Le Style Rothschild&quot;, that is, 18th-century French furniture, boulle, ebony, and ormolu, complemented by Old Masters and fine porcelain.

A huge domed conservatory known as the winter garden was attached to the house.

== In media ==

<text>Halton Hall was an English country house that stood in the grounds of the Halton Hall Estates and Manor for several centuries on the &quot;right bank of the River Lune to the south of the church&quot; in Halton, Lancashire.

== History ==
Halton was an important settlement before the Norman conquest. A manor-house was burnt down in 1322 by the invading Scots. A member of the Carus family was one of a group who purchased the manor in November 1583. Thereafter, the Carus family &quot;made it their residence. They seem to have obtained the old rectory-house and to have turned it into their dwelling-place&quot;. It is unclear whether this was the original, modern Halton Hall or when it was first built. Halton Hall was part of Halton Manor and was held by &quot;Esquire [Thomas] Carus and his two sons, Thomas and Christopher until 1715 when the family joined the Jacobite rising of 1715. The Carus family were labelled &quot;Papists&quot; as they had joined the rebels. With the failure of the rebellion, many properties were confiscated by the Forfeited Estates Commission and subsequently sold. Among them were Halton Hall, which then left the family. The building was modified substantially, especially during the last decade of the nineteenth century.

===Ownership and occupancy===

* A Thomas Carus was the last owner of the Carus family from whom the property was confiscated and subsequently sold
* William Bradshaw of Westminster

<text>Roger Wolfe Kahn (October 19, 1907 – July 12, 1962) was an American jazz and popular musician, composer, bandleader (Roger Wolfe Kahn and His Orchestra) and an aviator.
==Life and career==
Roger Wolfe Kahn (originally spelled &quot;Wolff&quot;) was born in Morristown, New Jersey, into a wealthy German Jewish banking family. His parents were Adelaide &quot;Addie&quot; (Wolff) and Otto Hermann Kahn, a famous banker and patron of the arts. His maternal grandfather was banker Abraham Wolff. Otto and Roger Kahn were the first father and son to appear separately on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine: Otto in November 1925 and Roger in September 1927, aged 19.

On 16 August 1926, Time magazine wrote: &quot;If it is strange that Otto Hermann Kahn, sensitive patron of high art in Manhattan, should have a saxophone-tooting, banjo-plunking, clarinet-wailing, violin-jazzing son, it is stranger still that that son, Roger Wolfe Kahn, has become a truly outstanding jazzer at the perilous age of 18. Roger&#x27;s ten orchestras, one of which he leads, have netted him some $30,000&quot;.

Kahn began studying the violin aged six and is said to have learned to play eighteen musical instruments before starting to lead his own orchestra in 1923, aged only 16. At the age of ten, Kahn had bought a ukulele in a Ditson Music Shop in Manhattan together with special-priced instruction on how to play; such was his keen interest in music. The ukulele lured him away from his studies at St. Bernard&#x27;s School and turned his mind toward violins, pianos, banjos and jazz orchestras. At St. Bernard&#x27;s he took no more interest in athletics than he did in studies or in social activities. By the age of sixteen, he’d rejected studying at college. Instead, he formed his own booking agency and organized a paying band and installed it at the Knickerbocker Grill in New York. He could play every instrument in the outfit, all self-taught, and his favorite instruments to play were the piano and saxophone. By the time he reached nineteen, he had eleven orchestras on his books that played in resorts and hotels from Newport, Rhode Island to Florida. They’d netted him personally an average of $50,000 a year for the four years of their existence. His success enabled him to pursue his passion for composing music and aviation.

In 1925, Kahn appeared in a short film made in Lee De Forest&#x27;s Phonofilm sound-on-film process. Kahn hired many famous jazz musicians and singers of the day to play and sing in his band, especially during recording sessions (e.g.) Tommy Dorsey, Morton Downey, Joe Venuti, Eddie Lang, Artie Shaw, Jack Teagarden, Red Nichols, Libby Holman, Gertrude Niesen, Franklyn Baur, Dick Robertson, Elmer Feldkamp and Gene Krupa. Early on in his career Kahn made several recordings under the name Roger Wolfe Kahn and His Hotel Biltmore Orchestra. It was during September, 1925, that Joe Venuti joined the Kahn Orchestra during their residency at the New York Biltmore Hotel.

On 15 December 1925, Kahn and his Orchestra recorded four takes of the song &quot;Rhythm Of The Day&quot; for Victor Records and for some reason Victor chose not to release any of them. Undeterred, Kahn wrote the song &quot;Following You Around&quot;, which made him money and George Whiteman went on to arrange the score of Kahn’s stage musical &quot;Rhapsurdity&quot;. Another musical comedy Kahn wrote, (a satire on musical comedy) called &quot;Hearts and Flowers&quot;, was produced by Horace Liveright.

He made recordings for:
* Victor 1925–29,
* Brunswick 1929–30,
* Columbia in 1932.

In February 1926, Kahn&#x27;s recording of &quot;I&#x27;m Sitting On Top Of The World&quot; charted at #9. It was reported in Variety, (September 29, 1926); &quot;&quot;Roger Wolfe Kahn and his original Victor orchestra of eleven are getting $4200 for five and a half days booking commencing October 4 at the New Orpheum Palace, Chicago, which Kahn&#x27;s band will headline at the opening attraction. The Kahn outfit returns to the Albee, Brooklyn, NY followed by the Palace Theatre, New York, following which they commence rehearsals for their new cafe, Le Perroquet de Paris, scheduled for opening in November&quot;.

Kahn fronted several fashionable night clubs in New York. One of his own clubs, Le Perroquet de Paris, opened in New York in November 1926 with a five-dollar cover charge. On 16 August 1926, Time magazine wrote: &quot;Last week, Roger announced his purchase of Giro&#x27;s (night club) in Manhattan; his partner is Rene Racover of the Perroquet in Paris (France); his resort&#x27;s new name is Perroquet de Paris.&quot;&quot; Kahn spent $250,000 of his father’s money on decorating the club and installing a silver stage proscenium. The club had a mirrored dance floor and aquariums beneath the individual tables and Kahn made a point of following the Parisian example of giving expensive souvenirs to the women that visited his clubs. At Le Perroquet de Paris he gave each female guest a bottle of premier perfume. Variety magazine reported Le Perroquet de Paris to be, &quot;&quot;the last gasp in smart night clubs. Ultra artistic with an ultra &#x27;In following&#x27; (with) the millionaire maestro&#x27;s own crack dance band. Be sure to make it. $5 couvert.&quot;&quot;

In 1927, Kahn produced two Vitaphone film shorts called &quot;Night Club&quot;. One short featured an act called the Williams Sisters (a singing/dancing duo). Both shorts were filmed on February 14, 1927 at the Manhattan Opera House on 315 West 34th Street in New York, and the Williams Sisters were featured in the short numbered Vitaphone #469 as &#x27;signing and dancing youngsters&#x27; performing a number titled &quot;Thinking of You.&quot; The Vitaphone film was an early attempt at sound movies which used both film and disk for sound. A reviewer in the &quot;San Antonio Express&quot;, April 10, 1927 wrote: &quot;Roger Wolfe Kahn&#x27;s specialty on the Vitaphone is undoubtedly the best subject offered since the installation of the devise. His instrumental harmony is wonderful and original... and the Williams Sisters act brings the act above par for any circuit.&quot; A copy of the sound disk supposedly exits at the Library of Congress in Washington, but the film elements are missing and presumed lost.

In some respect, due to his father&#x27;s prominence, Kahn’s imagined Gatsbyesque lifestyle made him a regular feature of gossip columns, although in reality he was carefully unobtrusive and shied away from company. Were it not for his precipitous enthusiasms and precocious successes he may well have attracted little more than statistical notice. Unlike his younger days when he took little interest in fashion, by the time he’d reached twenty, as an eligible bachelor he’d grown more debonair. During one trip to Europe in 1927, he returned to New York City with fifty new tailored-suits and untold neckties, shoes and hats. It was even reported in the press that during the trip he’d become engaged to marry a Miss Virginia Franck (a professional dancer), which turned out to be an untruth.

During 1927, Kahn hired Hannah Williams from the Williams Sisters to dance in a revue at his New York Night Club, Le Perroquet de Paris. It was during her engagement at the club that she popularised the song, &quot;Hard Hearted Hannah (The Vamp of Savannah)&quot;.

In 1928, Kahn co-wrote the jazz standard &quot;Crazy Rhythm&quot; with Irving Caesar and Joseph Meyer for the Broadway musical &quot;Here&#x27;s Howe&quot;.

Kahn always had fun leading and conducting his orchestra. Reportedly, when the band was playing especially well he used to throw himself onto the floor and wave his legs in the air.
However, the passion Kahn had for music was usurped by his deeper passion for flying and it was during his many trips accompanying his parents to Europe that Kahn developed his aviation skills. During one trip to France he chartered his own plane in Paris and flew it to London. Unlike the transatlantic hero, Charles Lindbergh, who after his triumphant arrival in Paris was to cross the English Channel by air the same day and had to postpone the flight on account of a heavy fog, Kahn flew anyway.
As well as owning a string of expensive motor vehicles and a speedboat, Kahn went on to purchase a stunt airplane, which he flew to compete in transcontinental races. Kahn’s love of ‘speed’ became an ongoing worry for his parents.

==Aviation career==
On March 29, 1934, Kahn’s father, Otto Hermann Kahn died. Doubtless, his father’s sudden and unexpected death played a major role in Kahn reassessing his own life and career. Kahn&#x27;s interest in aviation was no secret; he was already a member of the Advisory Board for the American Society for the Promotion of Aviation. He joined as early as 1928 and in 1933, Kahn had become a test pilot for Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation on Long Island, a well-known aircraft manufacturer.
Kahn would later excel in the role of managing the technical service and sales division of Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation and Grumman built a special sales aircraft, known as a G-58B (a modified F8F Bearcat fighter plane), in which he toured numerous military bases across North America during his career with the company. In 1943, Kahn was chairman of the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences and later became its vice-president . In 1956, Kahn became a member of the Laura Taber Barbour Air Safety Award Board (LTBASAB). Kahn also became chairman of the National Aeronautic Association (NAA).

==The Kahn Orchestra 1938 reunion concert==
In 1938, the Kahn Orchestra reformed to perform a special one-off concert, in what could have been the Kahn Orchestra’s last concert. The show was held in honor of the unveiling of the Golden Age Aviation Mural installed at Roosevelt Field Airport: the mural was painted by the artist Aline Rhonie Hofheimer (a pilot herself) who had been commissioned to paint a fresco mural on the north brick wall of Roosevelt Field Hangar F. The mural commemorated the history of aviation from 1908 to 1927 ending with Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s trans-Atlantic flight. After the mural was completed, there was an artist&#x27;s reception and party held at Roosevelt Field Airport on October 15, 1938. The invitation’s read, ‘&quot;You are invited to attend a party and barn dance given in honor of Aline Rhonie commemorating her achievement in the completion of the world’s largest aviation fresco depicting the history of aviation&quot;.’ It was at this reception that ‘&quot;A&quot; Roger Wolfe Kahn Orchestra’ performed. That might have meant a tribute-type band, or it may have been that Rhonie was able to use her pilot network to coax Kahn to reform a band to perform during this special occasion. The party ran from ten in the evening until dawn. The &quot;New York Times&quot; on October 17, 1938 reported, &quot;&#x27;The fresco was unveiled at a party on Saturday night, attended by more than 500 guests. This all-night party, with informal dress, was probably THE event for October at Roosevelt Field&quot;.&#x27; It doesn&#x27;t mention in the report whether Kahn himself fronted the orchestra.

==The Kahn family==
Roger Wolfe Kahn was born in Morristown, New Jersey, into a family surrounded by wealth, art and artistic people. He had one elder brother, Gilbert, and two elder sisters, Maude and Margaret Dorothy. The children grew up in Morristown, where under the direction of their mother, Adelaide Wolff Kahn, they followed a schedule of lessons interspersed with play. At the weekends, the routine was shattered with the arrival of their father, Otto Kahn, from New York. He diverted them and give them his undivided attention. Otto Kahn&#x27;s wisdom in life was to &quot;Live life. Love beauty. Be happy.&quot; When Roger was five, he and his family moved from New Jersey to London, where they resided for two years at St Dunstan&#x27;s House in Regent&#x27;s Park; this was rebuilt as Winfield House in the 1930s and is now the American Ambassador&#x27;s residence. The house had the largest private garden in London second only to the garden at Buckingham Palace. The constant travelling Kahn experienced during his childhood accompanying his parents to Europe gave him and his brother and sisters a broader education than most children would have received. Kahn&#x27;s passion for aviation grew from these frequent trips abroad.

In 1931, Kahn made headlines on the New York society pages when he married Broadway musical comedy actress Hannah Williams on January 16, 1931. The wedding was held at Oheka Castle, his family&#x27;s country estate on Long Island, and the marriage was kept secret from the public for two weeks, until the Broadway show Williams was appearing in, &quot;Sweet and Low&quot;, had had its final performances. The American public took the newlyweds to their hearts and Kahn referred to his wife as the &quot;Cheerful Little Earful&quot;, after the song of the same name which his wife had sung on Broadway. The marriage did not last and the couple made headlines again when they divorced two years later and when, after only a few weeks, Williams married boxing champion Jack Dempsey. Three days after the divorce, on April 7, 1933, Roger Wolfe Kahn married Edith May Nelson, daughter of a Maine politician, John E. Nelson, and they lived on Muttontown Road, Syosset, Long Island. They had two children, Peter W. Kahn and Dacia W. Kahn. Their marriage lasted until Kahn&#x27;s death of a heart attack in New York City on July 12, 1962.

==In popular culture==
In the 1979 film &quot;The Jerk&quot;, listening to a version of Kahn&#x27;s song &quot;Crazy Rhythm&quot; on the radio inspires Steve Martin&#x27;s character to hitchhike to St. Louis, setting in motion his rise, fall, and eventual reunion with his adopted family.

Roger Wolfe Kahn and his Orchestra have four song entries in the ‘Top 1000 instrumentals of all time’, no. 360 - &quot;Mountain Greenery&quot;, no. 782 - &quot;A Little Bungalow&quot;, no. 823 - &quot;Clap Yo&#x27; Hands&quot;, and at no. 889 - &quot;I&#x27;m Sitting on Top of the World&quot;.

Two of Roger Wolfe Kahn&#x27;s songs, &quot;Into My Heart&quot; and &quot;Exactly Like You&quot;, were sampled by The Caretaker for his final project, &quot;Everywhere at the end of time&quot;.

<text>The Continental Navy was the navy of the Thirteen Colonies (later the United States) during the American Revolutionary War. Founded on October 13, 1775, the fleet developed into a substantial force throughout the Revolutionary War, owing partially to the efforts of naval patrons within the Continental Congress. These congressional patrons included the likes of John Adams, who served as the chairman of the Naval Committee until 1776, when Commodore Esek Hopkins received instruction from the Continental Congress to assume command of the force.

The initial force consisted of several converted merchantmen as a consequence of the lack of funds available for use by the navy, which was seen as of secondary importance by early American leaders amidst a land war with Britain. The Continental Navy had variable success in its goals of intercepting shipments of British matériel and disrupting British maritime commerce, meeting with success in only limited circumstances and ultimately having little impact on the outcome of the war. The fleet did, however, serve to highlight Continental resolve and bolster American morale, for example launching Captain John Barry into the limelight. Additionally, it provided needed experience for the first generation of American officers, who went on to command the early United States Navy. With the Continental Army&#x27;s victory in the Revolutionary War, the navy was dissolved, with its few remaining ships and assets sold off. The final vessel, &quot;Alliance&quot;, was auctioned off in 1785 to a private bidder.

==Congressional oversight of construction==
The original intent was to intercept the supply of arms and provisions to British soldiers, who had placed Boston under martial law. George Washington had already informed Congress that he had assumed command of several ships for this purpose, and individual governments of various colonies had outfitted their own warships. The first formal movement for a navy came from Rhode Island, whose State Assembly passed a resolution on August 26, 1775, instructing its delegates to Congress to introduce legislation calling &quot;for building at the Continental expense a fleet of sufficient force, for the protection of these colonies, and for employing them in such a manner and places as will most effectively annoy our enemies...&quot; The measure in the Continental Congress was met with much derision, especially on the part of Maryland delegate Samuel Chase who exclaimed it to be &quot;the maddest idea in the world.&quot; John Adams later recalled, &quot;The opposition... was very loud and vehement. It was... represented as the most wild, visionary, mad project that had ever been imagined. It was an infant taking a mad bull by his horns.&quot;

During this time, however, the issue arose of Quebec-bound British supply ships carrying desperately needed provisions that could otherwise benefit the Continental Army. The Continental Congress appointed Silas Deane and John Langdon to draft a plan to seize ships from the convoy in question.

==Creation==
On June 12, 1775, the Rhode Island General Assembly, meeting at East Greenwich, passed a resolution creating a navy for the colony of Rhode Island. The same day, Governor Nicholas Cooke signed orders addressed to Captain Abraham Whipple, commander of the sloop &quot;Katy&quot; and commodore of the armed vessels employed by the government.

The first formal movement for the creation of a Continental navy came from Rhode Island because its merchants&#x27; widespread shipping activities had been severely harassed by British frigates. On August 26, 1775, Rhode Island General Assembly passed a resolution that there be a single Continental fleet funded by the Continental Congress. The resolution was introduced in the Continental Congress on October 3, 1775, but was tabled. In the meantime, George Washington had begun to acquire ships, starting with the schooner which was chartered by Washington from merchant and Continental Army Lt. Colonel John Glover of Marblehead, Massachusetts. &quot;Hannah&quot; was commissioned and launched on September 5, 1775, under the command of Captain Nicholson Broughton from the port of Beverly, Massachusetts.

The United States Navy decided in 1971 to recognize October 13, 1775 as the date of its official establishment, the passage of the resolution of the Continental Congress at Philadelphia that created the Continental Navy. On this day, Congress authorized the purchase of two vessels to be armed for a cruise against British merchant ships; these ships became and . The first ship in commission was which was purchased on November 4 and commissioned on December 3 by Captain Dudley Saltonstall. On November 10, 1775, the Continental Congress passed a resolution calling for two battalions of Marines to be raised for service with the fleet. John Adams drafted its first governing regulations, which were adopted by Congress on November 28, 1775, and remained in effect throughout the Revolutionary War. The Rhode Island resolution was reconsidered by the Continental Congress and was passed on December 13, 1775, authorizing the building of thirteen frigates within the next three months: five ships of 32 guns, five with 28 guns, and three with 24 guns.

When it came to selecting commanders for ships, Congress tended to be split evenly between merit and patronage. Among those who were selected for political reasons were Esek Hopkins, Dudley Saltonstall, and Esek Hopkins&#x27; son John Burroughs Hopkins. However, Abraham Whipple, Nicholas Biddle, and John Paul Jones managed to be appointed with backgrounds in marine warfare.
On December 22, 1775, Esek Hopkins was appointed the naval commander-in-chief, and officers of the navy were commissioned. Saltonstall, Biddle, Hopkins, and Whipple were commissioned as captains of the &quot;Alfred&quot;, &quot;Andrew Doria&quot;, &quot;Cabot&quot;, and , respectively.

Hopkins led the first major naval action of the Continental Navy in early March 1776 with this small fleet, complemented by (12), (8), and (10). The battle occurred at Nassau, Bahamas where stores of much-needed gunpowder were seized for the use of the Continental Army. However, success was diluted with the appearance of disease spreading from ship to ship.

On April 6, 1776, the squadron, with the addition of (8), unsuccessfully encountered the 20-gun in the first major sea battle of the Continental Navy. Hopkins failed to give any substantive orders other than to recall the fleet from the engagement, a move which Captain Nicholas Biddle described: &quot;away we all went helter, skelter, one flying here, another there.&quot;

On Lake Champlain, Benedict Arnold ordered the construction of 12 war vessels to slow down the British fleet that was invading New York from Canada. The British fleet destroyed Arnold&#x27;s fleet, but the US fleet managed to slow down the British after a two-day battle, known as the Battle of Valcour Island, and managed to slow the progression of the British Army.

As the war progressed, states began directing more resources toward naval pursuits. During the inaugural session of the Virginia General Assembly, the senate began acquiring lands for naval manufacturing. Charles O. Paullin states that &quot;no other state owned as much land, properties, and manufactories devoted to naval purposes as Virginia. Sampson Mathews oversaw the operation stationed at Warwick on the James River, the most important of the works, which produced much sail material from flax grown in his home county of Augusta, as there was no money available to buy linen cloth for sails.

==The thirteen frigates==
By December 13, 1775, Congress had authorized the construction of 13 new frigates, rather than refitting merchantmen to increase the fleet. Five ships (, , , , and ) were to be rated 32 guns, five (, , , , and ) 28 guns, and three (, , and ) 24 guns. Only eight frigates made it to sea and their effectiveness was limited; they were completely outmatched by the Royal Navy, and nearly all were captured or sunk by 1781.

&quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;Effingham&quot;, &quot;Congress&quot;, and &quot;Montgomery&quot; were scuttled or burned in October and November 1777 before going to sea to prevent their capture by the British. , commanded by Captain James Nicholson, made a number of unsuccessful attempts to break through the blockade of Chesapeake Bay. On March 31, 1778, in another attempt, she ran aground near Hampton Roads, where her captain went ashore. Shortly after, and appeared on the scene to accept her surrender.

Guarding American commerce and raiding British commerce and supply were the principal duties of the Continental Navy. Privateers had some success, with 1,697 letters of marque being issued by Congress. Individual states, American agents in Europe and in the Caribbean also issued commissions; taking duplications into account more than 2,000 commissions were issued by the various authorities. Lloyd&#x27;s of London estimated that 2,208 British ships were taken by Yankee privateers, amounting to almost $66 million, a significant sum at the time.

Most of the eight frigates that went to sea took multiple prizes and had semi-successful cruises before their captures, however, there were exceptions. On September 27, 1777, participated in a delaying action on the Delaware River against the British army pursuing George Washington&#x27;s forces. The ebb tide arrived and left the &quot;Delaware&quot; stranded, leading to her capture. was blockaded in Providence, Rhode Island, shortly after her completion, and did not break out of the blockade until March 8, 1778. After a successful cruise under Captain John Burroughs Hopkins, she was assigned to the ill-fated Penobscot Expedition under Captain Dudley Saltonstall, where she was trapped by the British and burned on August 15, 1779, to prevent her capture. , captained by John Manley, managed to capture two merchantmen as well as the Royal Navy vessel . Later on July 8, 1777, however, the &quot;Hancock&quot; was captured by HMS &quot;Rainbow&quot; of a pursuing squadron, and became the British man of war &quot;Iris&quot;.

 took five prizes in her early cruises. On March 7, 1778, she was escorting a convoy of merchantmen when the British 64-gun ship bore down on the convoy. &quot;Randolph&quot;, under the command of Captain Nicholas Biddle came to the defense of the merchantmen and engaged the heavily superior foe. In the ensuing engagement, the two ships were both severely manhandled but in the course of the action, the magazine of the &quot;Randolph&quot; exploded causing the destruction of the entire vessel and all but four of her crew. The falling debris from the explosion severely damaged the &quot;Yarmouth&quot; enough that she could no longer pursue the American ships.

, under the command of Captain John Barry, captured three prizes before being run aground in action on September 27, 1778. Her crew scuttled her, but she was raised by the British who refloated her for further use in the name of the Crown.

, under the command of Captains Hector McNeill and Samuel Tucker, had captured 17 prizes in earlier cruises and had carried John Adams to France in February and March 1778. She was captured (along with the frigate which had taken 14 prizes in her own service under Captain Abraham Whipple) in the fall of Charleston, South Carolina on May 12, 1780.

The final frigate to meet her end of Continental service was . &quot;Trumbull&quot;, which had not gone to sea until September 1779 under James Nicholson, had gained acclaim in bloody action against the Letter of Marque &quot;Watt&quot;. On August 28, 1781, she met HMS &quot;Iris&quot; and &quot;General Monk&quot; and engaged. In the action, &quot;Trumbull&quot; was forced to surrender to the former American naval vessels (the &quot;General Monk&quot; was the captured Rhode Island privateer &quot;General Washington&quot;, itself recaptured in April 1782 and placed in service with the Continental Navy).

==French naval collaboration==

Before the Franco-American Alliance, the royalist French government attempted to maintain a state of respectful neutrality during the Revolutionary War. That being said, the nation maintained neutrality at face value, often openly harboring Continental vessels and supplying their needs.

With the presence of American diplomats Benjamin Franklin and Silas Deane, the Continental Navy gained a permanent link to French affairs. Through Franklin and like-minded agents, Continental officers were afforded the ability to receive commissions and to survey and purchase prospective ships for military use.

Early in the conflict, Captains Lambert Wickes and Gustavus Conyngham operated out of various French ports for the purpose of commerce raiding. The French did attempt to enforce their neutrality by seizing and of the Continental Navy. However, with the commencement of the official alliance in 1778, ports were officially open to Continental ships.

The most prominent Continental officer to operate out of France was Captain John Paul Jones. Jones had been preying upon British commerce aboard but only now saw the opportunity for higher command. The French loaned Jones the merchantman &quot;Duc de Duras&quot;, which Jones refitted and renamed as a more powerful replacement for the &quot;Ranger&quot;. In August 1779, Jones was given command of a squadron of vessels of both American and French ownership. The goal was not only to harass British commerce but also to prospectively land 1,500 French regulars in the lightly guarded western regions of Britain. Unfortunately for the ambitious Jones, the French pulled out of the agreement pertaining to an invasion force, but the French did manage to uphold the plan regarding his command of the naval squadron. Sailing in a clockwise fashion around Ireland and down the east coast of Britain, the squadron captured a number of merchantmen. French commander Landais decided early on in the expedition to retain control of the French ships, thereby often leaving and rejoining the effort when he felt that it was fortuitous.

On September 23, 1779, Jones&#x27; squadron was off Flamborough Head when the British man-of-war and HM hired armed ship bore down on the Franco-American force. The lone Continental frigate &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; engaged &quot;Serapis&quot;. The rigging of the two ships became entangled during the combat, and several guns of Jones&#x27; ship had been taken out of action. The captain of &quot;Serapis&quot; asked Jones if he had struck his colors, to which Jones has been quoted as replying, &quot;I have not yet begun to fight!&quot; Upon raking the &quot;Serapis&quot;, the crew of the &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; led by Jones boarded the British ship and captured her. Likewise, the French frigate &quot;Pallas&quot; captured &quot;Countess of Scarborough&quot;. Two days later, &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; sank from the overwhelming amount of damage that she had sustained. The action was an embarrassing defeat for the Royal Navy.

The French also loaned the Continental Navy the use of the corvette . The one ship of the line built for service in the Continental Navy was the 74-gun , but it was offered as a gift to France on September 3, 1782, in compensation for the loss of &quot;Le Magnifique&quot; in service to the American Revolution.

France officially entered the war on June 17, 1778. Still, the ships that the French sent to the Western Hemisphere spent most of the year in the West Indies and only sailed near the Thirteen Colonies during the Caribbean hurricane season from July until November. The first French fleet attempted landings in New York and Rhode Island, but ultimately failed to engage British forces during 1778. In 1779, a fleet commanded by Vice Admiral Charles Henri, comte d&#x27;Estaing assisted American forces attempting to recapture Savannah, Georgia.

In 1780, a fleet with 6,000 troops commanded by Lieutenant General Jean-Baptiste, comte de Rochambeau landed at Newport, Rhode Island; shortly afterward, the British blockaded the fleet. In early 1781, Washington and de Rochambeau planned an attack against the British in the Chesapeake Bay area to coordinate with the arrival of a large fleet under Vice Admiral François, comte de Grasse. Washington and de Rochambeau marched to Virginia after successfully deceiving the British that an attack was planned in New York, and de Grasse began landing forces near Yorktown, Virginia. On September 5, 1781, de Grasse and the British met in the Battle of the Virginia Capes, which ended with the French fleet in control of Chesapeake Bay. Protected from the sea by the French fleet, American and French forces surrounded, besieged, and forced the surrender of the British forces under Lord Cornwallis, effectively winning the war and leading to peace two years later.

==Administration==

===Governing bodies===
The Second Continental Congress created a Naval Committee of three members on Oct. 13, 1775. At the end of the month it was expanded to seven members. By the end of January 1776 three members were not active and the remaining four were appointed members of the Marine Committee created already on Dec. 13, 1775, when Congress decided to build 13 warships. This committee had thirteen members, one from each of the United Colonies, and was authorized to direct the fleet and ships movements by order to naval officers, appoint officers, review the verdicts of naval courts-martial, and build and purchase naval vessels. In September 1776 Congress created the Navy Board of the Middle Department with three members, not members of Congress, and seat in Philadelphia. In April 1777, the Navy Board of the Eastern Department was created for New England with seat in Boston. These boards were subordinate agencies under the Marine Committee and its successors. The Board of Admiralty was created Oct. 28, 1779 and contained two members of Congress and three other commissioners. Its mission was naval planning, the direction of ships and fleets, superintending the marine department, administering the supply of the navy and the settling of accounts. Dec. 8, Congress decided that the Board would take over all matters heretofore taken care of by the Marine Committee. Feb. 7, 1781, Congress decided to create the office of Secretary of Marine replacing the Board of Admiralty. No one was found willing and able to accept that office, so Congress instead created the officer of Agent of Marine Aug. 19, 1781 and on Sept. 7. 1781 made Robert Morris holder of that office while remaining Superintendent of Finance. When Morris resigned as superintendent of finance 1784, Congress did not appoint a successor as Marine Agent and when the USS Alliance was sold in 1785, the naval establishment of the United States ceased to exist without any formal decision.

The original three members of the Naval Committee were Silas Deane, John Langdon and Christopher Gadsden. The additional four were Stephen Hopkins, Joseph Hewes, Richard Henry Lee and John Adams. The thirteen original members of the Marine Committee were Josiah Bartlett, N.H.; John Hancock, Mass.; Stephen Hopkins, R.I.; Silas Deane, Conn.; Francis Lewis, N.Y.; Stephen Crane, N.J.; Robert Morris, Pa.; George Read, Del.; Samuel Chase, Md.; Richard Henry Lee, Va.; Joseph Hewes, N.C.; Christopher Gadsden, S.C. and John Houstoun, Ga. Original members of the Navy Board of the Middle Department were John Nixon (resigned 1778), John Wharton (resigned 1778), and Francis Hopkinson (resigned 1778). New members were William Smith (1778–1778), James Searle (1778–1778), John Wharton (reappointed 1778–1781), James Read (1778 only member late in 1781), William Winder (1778–1781). Members of the Navy Board of the Eastern Department were James Warren (until 1782), William Vernon (until 1781) and John Deshon (until 1781). Commissioners of the Board of Admiralty were Francis Lewis (from 1779) and William Ellery (from 1780), no third commissioner was ever appointed. Congressional members were James Forbes (1779–1780), William Ellery (1779–1780), James Madison (1780–1780), Daniel Huntington (1780–1780), Whitmill Hill (1780–1780), Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer (only congressional member 1781). Alexander McDougall refused the offer of becoming Secretary of Marine as the Congress did not allow him to retain his rank in the army. Robert Morris was Agent of Marine from 1781 to 1784.

===Shore establishment===
When the Marine Committee was created in 1775 it appointed Continental agents in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Boston, Providence, Rhode Island, New London, Connecticut, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Williamsburg, Virginia, Edenton, New Bern and Wilmington, North Carolina, and Charleston, South Carolina and Savannah, Georgia. They administered the building of warships in their respective ports and purchased cannons, anchors and sails as well provisions and all other items needed on a ship of war. Doing this they relied on the tradesmen and merchants that had sustained the colonial merchant marines. Established ship chandlers, provision merchants, ship&#x27;s agents and other members of the business community put their experience to use by the Continental Navy. Most Continental agents were also in charge of the disposing of prizes. When established, the Navy Boards became purveyors and suppliers of ships stationed in Philadelphia and Boston, but the Continental agents continued in these roles in the other ports. The Boards gave orders to the Agents but they often bypassed the Boards and communicated directly with the Marine Committee and later the Board of Admiralty. The American commissioners in Paris filled the function of an overseas Navy Board They directed ships operations, commissioned officers, recruited crews, as well as purchasing, storing and distributing supply for the ships operating in European waters. When Benjamin Franklin became United States Minister to France, these tasks fell on him personally. He employed naval agents in both France and the Netherlands.

After 1780, naval administration deteriorated; Agents were dismissed for not submitting accounts, neglecting their assignments and sometimes for outright corruption. Members of the Board of Admiralty, the Navy Boards and Agents surrendered their commissions disgusted with the existing administrative and financial chaos. The accounting system collapsed in 1781. Lack of funds for new ships and heavy ship&#x27;s losses reduced the Continental Navy to three ships. When Robert Morris became Agent of Marine in 1781 he closed all navy offices except the Eastern Navy Board as they still had USS Alliance and USS Deane to outfit. He appointed Naval Agents in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia with the task of auditing and settling accounts. In June 1783 Joseph Pennell was appointed Commissioner for Settling the Accounts of the Marine Department with branch offices at Boston, New York City and Philadelphia. Morris resigned as Marine Agent in 1784 and the Commissioner was transferred to the Department of the Treasury in 1785.

===Operating forces===
When late in 1775, Esek Hopkins was commissioned Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet of the United Colonies he was put in charge of receiving monthly reports of the strength, supply situation and the state of each ship of war, and forwarding them to Congress. It was his duty to issue orders and instructions necessary for the good of the service and to develop a good leadership culture in the Navy. The captain of each ship was responsible for its administration; muster rolls and accounts of provisions and other stores were kept under his responsibility. Change of command required a thorough inventory of ship&#x27;s stores, provisions and equipage and then the ongoing commander had to sign for it. Pursers were civilian officers in civilian clothes who had learned their job as supercargoes in the colonial merchant marines. There were very few pursers serving in the Continental Navy as it was more profitable for competent persons to take employment with the large number of privateers outfitted during the war. The administrative functions aboard a Continental man of war was instead fulfilled by petty officers: captain&#x27;s clerks and stewards. Ship&#x27;s provisions were drawn from Continental Agents or Navy Boards, and transfers took place between ships and even with Continental Army units as necessity required.

==End of the Continental Navy==
Of the approximately 65 vessels (new, converted, chartered, loaned, and captured) that served at one time or another with the Continental Navy, only 11 survived the war. The Treaty of Paris in 1783 ended the Revolutionary War and, by 1785, Congress had disbanded the Continental Navy and sold the remaining ships.

The frigate fired the final shots of the American Revolutionary War; it was also the last ship in the Navy. A faction within Congress wanted to keep her, but the new nation did not have the funds to keep her in service, and she was auctioned off for $26,000. Factors leading to the dissolution of the Navy included a general lack of money, the loose confederation of the states, a change of goals from war to peace, and more domestic and fewer foreign interests.

==Continental Navy uniforms==
The Marine Committee issued a uniform instruction on Sept. 5, 1776, with the following specifications:
* Captains, blue cloth, with red lapels, slash cuff, stand-up collar, flat yellow buttons, blue breeches and red waistcoat with narrow lace
* Lieutenants, blue cloth, with red lapels, round cuff faced with red, stand-up collar, flat yellow buttons, blue breeches and red waistcoat, plain.
* Masters, blue cloth with lapels, round cuff, blue breeches and red waistcoat.
* Midshipmen, blue cloth with lapels, round cuff faced with red, stand-up collar red at the button and buttonhole, blue breeches and red waistcoat.

No instructions were issued for the dress of petty officers and seamen. The paucity of fabric at this time made it necessary for the officers to dress in what was available they would not always be dressed according to instructions. Besides, many naval officers did not really like the uniforms prescribed and a group of them met in Boston in 1777 and agreed on a new uniform. The dress selected looked very much like a Royal Navy uniform. The agreement contained the following particulars:
* Captains, blue cloth lined and faced with white and trimmed with gold lace with an epaulet on the right shoulder, blue cloth lined and faced with white and trimmed with gold lace with an epaulet on the right shoulder, white waistcoat and white breeches.
* Lieutenants, blue cloth lined and faced with white, no trim and without epaulet, blue cloth lined and faced with white and trimmed with gold lace with an epaulet on the right shoulder, white waistcoat and white breeches.
* Masters and midshipmen, blue cloth lined with white, no lapels, white waistcoat and white breeches.

==Continental Navy pay==
Pay table in dollars per calendar month, adopted by the Continental Congress, Nov. 15, 1775.

At the same time the pay table was adopted, Congress resolved how the rank of the Naval officers be to the rank of officers in the Land Forces: commodore as brigadier general, captain of a ship of 40 guns and upwards as colonel, captain of a ship of 20 to 40 guns as lieutenant colonel, captain of a ship of 10 to 20 guns as major, lieutenant in the Navy as captain.

<doc id="419724" wikidata="Q2090663" url="?curid=419724" title="Polyfidelity">
<text>Polyfidelity is a type of non-monogamous relationship in which all members are recognized as equivalent to the other partners and comply to restrict sexual and romantic relationship activities to exclusively only other members within the group. 

==Origin==
The practices and beliefs underlying polyfidelity have long existed, but in uncodified fashion. The Oneida Commune of the mid-19th century practiced complex marriage, encouraging individual members in the freedom to have multiple ongoing sexual relationships within the community, as an expression of their beliefs and religious faith. This was occasionally referred to as a group marriage, a term brought back to popular recognition by the 1974 publication of &quot;Group Marriage: a study of contemporary multilateral marriage&quot; by Larry Constantine and Joan Constantine.

The term polyfidelity was also practiced in the &quot;New Tribe&quot; of the Kerista Commune. A utopian community based in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco, California active from the 1970s to the early 1990s. The engaged in a specific form of polyamory. Members were required to engage in multi-partner relationships that prioritize equality, and mutual consent. Respecting diverse gender identities and sexual orientations. Sexual activity with all members was encouraged while forming exclusive relationships within the group was discouraged. Consensus was essential for incorporating new members in and also respecting the group&#x27;s foundational agreement. 

The broader term &quot;polyamory&quot; was coined later. The word &quot;polyamorous&quot; first appeared in an article by Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart, &quot;A Bouquet of Lovers&quot;, published in May 1990 in &quot;Green Egg&quot; magazine, as &quot;poly-amorous&quot;. In May 1992, Jennifer L. Wesp created the Usenet newsgroup alt.polyamory, and the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) cites the proposal to create that group as the first verified appearance of the word. The words &quot;polyamory&quot;, &quot;polyamorous&quot;, and &quot;polyamorist&quot; were added to the OED in 2006.

== Function ==
Polyfidelitous relationships are, like monogamous relationships, &quot;closed&quot; in the sense that partners agree not to be sexually or romantically intimate with someone not in the relationship. The difference is that more than two people are included in the closed group. New members may generally be added to the group only by unanimous agreement of the existing members, or the group may not be interested in further expansion.

While being a subtype of the more general polyamory, polyfidelity can resemble monogamy in its relationship power dynamics, attitudes towards autonomy, and group consent, as most often polyfidelity develops from an established closed-monogamous couple seeking to add one or more individuals or another couple. In this sense, polyfidelity expands upon standard practices and beliefs of monogamy while still being categorically polyamory.

==Benefits and challenges==
A commonly cited advantage of polyfidelity is the ability to have unprotected sex among more than two people while maintaining relative safety regarding STDs, so long as any new members are sufficiently tested before fluid bonding with the group, and keep their commitments. This would have health advantages similar to monogamy, although risks rise somewhat with each person added.

Some gain a sense of emotional safety from the relatively closed nature of the poly faithful commitment.

Polyfidelity inherently affords less flexibility than other forms of nonmonogamy. For example, open relationships do not restrict sexual interactions to specific people. 

As many polyfidelitous people have transitioned directly from closed monogamy, they can encounter problems in learning to communicate intimately with more than one partner.

People hoping to create or expand a group marriage mention difficulty finding potential partners with enough mutual compatibility to even consider attempting a relationship.

Polyfidelity, like other forms of consensual non-monogamy, can present the challenge of managing jealousy, maintaining clear communication, and ensuring equitable distribution of emotional and practical responsibilities. Successful polyfidelity often requires strong commitment and communication skills among all members.

==Other usage==
In the book &quot;Lesbian Polyfidelity&quot;, author Celeste West uses the term &quot;polyfidelity&quot; in much the same way that others use polyamory. This may represent independent coinage of the same term within a different community, and this usage is not common among polyamorists in general. West uses the term to emphasize the concept (common in polyamory) that one can be faithful to one&#x27;s commitments without those commitments including sexual exclusivity.

==Film and television==

===Television commercials===
Bellingham played the central character in the long-running &quot;Oxo Family&quot; series of TV commercials, starting in 1983, playing a mother who binds her family together by cooking them meals featuring Oxo products. The advertisements typically featured the family sitting down to a meal at which Oxo gravy would be served. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the family was seen to grow older.

===Other appearances===
In 1993, Bellingham was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; when she was surprised by Michael Aspel on the set of &quot;Second Thoughts&quot;.

In February 1999, she was part of the &quot;Heated Rollers&quot; comedy team alongside Gwyneth Strong and Joanna Monro. The &quot;Heated Rollers&quot; programme was the first all-women sketch show broadcast on BBC Radio 2, and the writers included Lesley Ann Albiston and Caroline Gold.

In 2011, Bellingham featured in a short film entitled &quot;Too Close for Comfort&quot;, playing the character of a mother to her real-life son, actor and celebrity butler Michael Peluso (from ITV&#x27;s fly-on-the-wall documentary series &quot;The Savoy&quot;). Bellingham and Peluso reprised their roles for the follow-up web series of the same name in 2014. Mirroring Bellingham&#x27;s personal life, her character had developed cancer.

==Live performances==
Twice in the 1960s, Bellingham appeared in the Pendley Open Air Shakespeare Festival.

In January 2005, she appeared in a play entitled &quot;Losing Louis&quot; at Hampstead Theatre before transferring to the Trafalgar Studios in London. Her performance received critical acclaim, especially from Michael Billington.

In October 2007, she appeared in the play &quot;Vincent River&quot; at the Trafalgar Studios in London.

From September 2008 to July 2009, Bellingham played the role of Chris Harper in the stage version of the hit film &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; on tour and at the Noël Coward Theatre in the West End. She returned to the show for further tours in 2010, 2011 and 2012.

Over the Christmas/New Year period of 2011/12, she played the Fairy Godmother in the pantomime &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the Birmingham Hippodrome. She played the role again at the Alhambra Theatre, Bradford over the Christmas/New Year period of 2012/13.

Bellingham was due to star in Kay Mellor&#x27;s play &quot;A Passionate Woman&quot; at the Sheffield Crucible, followed by a national tour, however, it was announced in July 2013 that the show had to be postponed owing to Bellingham&#x27;s cancer treatment.

==Writing==
In 2010, Bellingham launched her book &quot;Lost and Found&quot;, a story of her life and career and toured the country for private readings. Her novel &quot;Tell Me Tomorrow&quot; was published in 2013. In 2014, Bellingham&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;There&#x27;s Something I&#x27;m Dying to Tell You&quot;, was issued shortly before her death. Her final story, &quot;The Boy I Love&quot; was published posthumously in November 2014.

==Personal life==
Bellingham was married three times, first in 1975 to film and theatre producer Greg Smith. According to Bellingham in her 2010 autobiography, the marriage was one driven primarily by sex, with Smith later admitting to numerous affairs with other actresses, including some who sent nude photos to their home.

Her second marriage (1981–96) was to restaurateur Nunzio Peluso, with whom she had two sons, Michael and Robbie. The couple were introduced to each other at the Italian restaurant La Famiglia in Chelsea, London, in the early 1980s by friend and fellow actor Christopher Biggins. After a whirlwind courtship and romance, the couple married but the relationship was marred by Peluso&#x27;s jealousy of Bellingham&#x27;s former lovers leading to a series of altercations, fights and domestic abuse towards her. Around the same time as Bellingham was being abused by Peluso, she was starring in the Oxo adverts and felt bound to hide the truth about her marriage for fear of spoiling her image in the commercials. As Bellingham revealed in her 2010 autobiography &quot;Lost &amp; Found: My Story&quot;: &quot;maybe if my private life had been happier I would have enjoyed doing it more. As it was, I felt I was living a lie. Being the nation&#x27;s favourite mum on screen and going home to an abusive relationship was heartbreaking [...] the irony was horrific. Here I was, the Oxo mum, hiding behind closed doors, isolated from her friends and family.&quot; The couple divorced in 1996, Bellingham giving her former husband half of everything she owned, although he continued to intimidate her. A restraining order was granted in 2000 to keep Peluso away from his former wife. On 31 May 2008, Bellingham married her boyfriend, Spain-based timeshare salesman, Michael Pattemore (known on &quot;Loose Women&quot; as &quot;Mr Spain&quot;), at St Stephen Walbrook on her 60th birthday.

Bellingham was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2014 New Year Honours for voluntary service to charitable giving.

===Illness and death===
On 16 July 2013, it was announced that Bellingham had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer. She released a statement saying she was &quot;not going to die.&quot;

In September 2014, Bellingham confirmed that her cancer had metastasised to her lungs and liver and that she had &quot;months to live&quot;. She announced that she had made the choice in August 2014 to stop chemotherapy in November, so that she could have &quot;one last Christmas&quot; with her family and die in January 2015. Bellingham died in a London hospital on 19 October 2014 with her husband Michael by her side.

On 3 November 2014, her funeral took place at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church in Crewkerne. Bellingham was buried in Crewkerne Townsend Cemetery. Her headstone names her as Lynda Bellingham-Pattemore.

<text>is the goddess of dawn, mirth, meditation, revelry and the arts in the Shinto religion of Japan, and the wife of fellow-god Sarutahiko Ōkami. (-no-Mikoto is a common honorific appended to the names of Japanese gods; it may be understood as similar to the English honorific &#x27;the Great&#x27;.) She famously helped draw out the missing sun deity, Amaterasu Omikami, when she had hidden herself in a cave. Her name can also be pronounced as Ama-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto. She is also known as Ōmiyanome-no-Ōkami, an &quot;inari kami&quot; possibly due to her relationship with her husband.
She is also known as Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto, The Great Persuader, and The Heavenly Alarming Female. She is depicted in kyōgen farce as Okame, a woman who revels in her sensuality.

== Mythology ==
=== Amaterasu and the cave ===
Amaterasu&#x27;s brother, the storm god Susano&#x27;o, had vandalized her rice fields, threw a flayed horse at her loom, and brutally killed one of her maidens due to a quarrel between them. In turn, Amaterasu became furious with him and retreated into the Heavenly Rock Cave, Amano-Iwato. The world, without the illumination of the sun, became dark and the gods could not lure Amaterasu out of her hiding place.
The clever Uzume overturned a tub near the cave entrance and began to dance on it, tearing off her clothing in front of the other deities. They considered this so comical that they laughed heartily at the sight. This dance is said to have founded the Japanese ritual dance, Kagura. Further, this is also supported by other traditions claiming that the first kagura was danced by a shamaness who was a kami herself, Ame-no-Uzume, through luring (invoking the presence of) Amaterasu, thereby reenacting the intentions of the kagura as an act of communication to other deities. Moreover, in addition to inspiring the origins of the kagura, the myth of Ame-no-Uzume has also influenced the sources of three Shamanic elements later being incorporated into Shinto ritual and the kagura, being the Omoto Kagura, Hana Matsuri, and the Hayachine Kagura in presenting shamanic choreography as ritual communication, what the myth is most known for contributing.

Uzume had hung a bronze mirror and a beautiful jewel of polished jade. Amaterasu heard them, and peered out to see what the commotion was about. When she opened the cave, she saw the jewel and her glorious reflection in a mirror which Uzume had placed on a tree, and slowly came out from her clever hiding spot.

At that moment, the god Ame-no-Tajikarawo-no-mikoto dashed forth and closed the cave behind her, refusing to budge so that she could no longer retreat. Another god tied a magic shimenawa (compare the Nuristani myth of a chaff attaching itself to the thread around a house near heaven) across the entrance. The deities Ame-no-Koyane-no-mikoto and Ame-no-Futodama-no-mikoto then asked Amaterasu to rejoin the divine. She agreed, and light was restored to the earth.

=== Uzume and Sarutahiko ===

Amaterasu orders Uzume to accompany her grandson Ninigi on his journey to earth. They head to &quot;Ame-no-ukihashi&quot; (&quot;floating bridge of heaven&quot;) so they could head to earth but they are blocked by Sarutahiko. Uzume comes and persuades Sarutahiko to let Ninigi pass, in other versions of the story Uzume flirts with Sarutahiko. During this journey, she cut the mouth of the sea cucumber with her dagger, causing it to fall permanently silent.

Later, Uzume and Sarutahiko fall in love and got married. Together, they found the .

== Worship ==

Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto is still worshiped today as a Shinto kami. There are many shrines dedicated to the goddess including Chiyo shrine, Tsubaki America Shrine and Tsubaki Grand Shrine. In some, she is worshiped as a patroness of dancers and performers. Furthermore, there are connections between the myths of Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto alongside the eighth-century mythic texts that describe the similar yet unique mythology between 21st-century Japan and modern myth scholarship; being that there are debates both in the Japanese and English languages in terms of rendering the names of specific places, objects and characters in the Kiki to modern script. Moreover, the debate comes down to some characters in the Kiki having their Chinese characters within their name being consistent in translation while others are not, an example being with Ame-no-Uzume in different texts using different orthographies. As such, it is theorized that this decision is significant to the names in referring to the character phonetically as an identity that is of multiple sources, with scholars writing Ame-no-Uzume&#x27;s name in katakana heavily implying that the ideal form of the figure is within an abstract dimension rather than limited to a single textual appearance, asserting her outside of specific historically grounded texts.

Along with her husband, she is addressed during the November festival of Tori-no-ichi in which masks or pictures of the pair are sold.

==Similarities to Vedic religion==
According to Michael Witzel, Uzume is most closely related to the Vedic goddess Ushas (&quot;uṣás&quot;), a descendant of the Proto-Indo-European goddess Hausos (&quot;&quot;), and the Nuristani goddess Disani. Both goddesses share many similarities such as the cave (Vala/Iwato) and the exposure of breasts as a sign of friendship. Witzel proposed that the Japanese, Vedic, and Nuristani religions are much more closely related compared to other mythologies under what he calls Laurasian mythology, and that the three myths, may go back to the Indo-Iranian period, around 2000 BCE. This would make Uzume analogous to the Greek goddess Eos and the Roman goddess Aurora.

<text>Tabuaeran, also known as Fanning Island, is an atoll that is part of the Line Islands of the central Pacific Ocean and part of the island nation of Kiribati. The land area is , and the population in 2015 was 2,315. The maximum elevation is about 3 m (10 ft) above high tide.

The lagoon has an area of . The deepest water in the lagoon is about , but most of it is very shallow.

==History==

Tabuaeran was first inhabited by Polynesian people. Archaeological evidence points to a single large village being maintained for several hundred years on the west side of the atoll with other scattered production and agricultural sites across the atoll. Radiometric dates range from 1100 AD to 1425 AD (Cal. 810 ±50 BP and 620 ± 60 BP at 2 sigma). Continuous habitation is likely as stratigraphic cultural layers are uninterrupted and quite deep. Some archaeologists have argued that Tabuaeran and Kiritimati were one community living across a matched set of islands as despite their relative proximity, their climates and resources differ wildly covering what would otherwise be resource shortages. While this hypothesis is still being tested, the period of human habitation on these two islands does match up. Geochemical analysis of stone tools provides a clear window into trade networks that existed throughout Polynesia and in the case of Tabuaeran, a positive match was made with a quarry located in Eiao, Marquesas.

The first white man to sight Tabuaeran was American captain Edmund Fanning of the American ship &quot;Betsy&quot; on June 11, 1798; it was named for him. At the time, the atoll was uninhabited and, like all of the Line Islands, had no truly native population. After Fanning, it was visited by whalers of several nationalities. The whaler had wrecked there in late 1831 or early 1832.

By 1854, Captain Henry English and 150 labourers from Manihiki settled, and began producing coconut oil for export. He put the island under British protection when Captain W. H. Morshead arrived on on 16 October 1855.

In about 1857 a whaling ship put ashore William Greig who carried out planting of coconut trees to expand the production of copra, and who also began planting coconut trees on Washington Island. Eventually the sons of Greig owned the plantation with Father until he sold his interest to the Fanning Island Limited, and started a coconut plantation on Christmas Island.

Captain William Wiseman of formally annexed Fanning to Great Britain on 15 March 1888.

A deep opening, thereafter called the English Channel, was blasted on the west side of the atoll. Tabuaeran hosted a station on the Canada-to-Australia section of the All Red Line telegraph cable system, beginning in 1902. Fanning Island Post Office opened on 29 November 1902. During World War I, the cable station was visited in September 1914 by the Imperial German Navy light cruiser and was severely damaged when a landing force went ashore to put the station out of action. In 1939 the atoll was incorporated into the British colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. In 1979, it gained independence, becoming part of the Republic of Kiribati.

An airfield was constructed on Napari (Napali) islet when the University of Hawaii operated a tide monitoring station on the atoll. The station and the airfield closed in 1981. The airfield reopened in 2016, with regular domestic flights to Kiritimati.

==Present==
The administrative centre of the atoll is Paelau, on the west side.

Tabuaeran had a population of 1,960 at the 2010 census, principally Gilbertese settlers brought from the main Kiribati archipelago by Fanning Island Plantations, Ltd., to work in the copra industry.

The population declined from 2,539 at the 2005 census following the closure of the secondary school (since reopened), cessation of visits by Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL), and reduced operations by Atoll Seaweed Company.

Eight villages are listed in the 2015 census:

The main diet is imported rice and tinned meats, supplemented by local foods: reef fish and shellfish, &quot;babai&quot; (&quot;Cyrtosperma merkusii&quot;), coconut, pigs, chickens, and seaweed (limu).

Major exports are copra and hand crafts (including cowrie shell, shark tooth knives, and Kiribati stamps). An Australian supply ship calls two or three times a year. The sailing vessel &quot;Kwai&quot; also stops on the island.

The main health centre is located at Paelau in the west, with additional clinics on Napari (Napali) islet in the north and Kimarimari in the south. Helpful organizations with concerns for the local schools, churches and healthcare needs are Pacific CARE Missions and Pacific Island Aid.

==Ecology==
Overfishing and pollution have impacted on the ocean surrounding the island. In the ocean surrounding uninhabited islands of the Northern Line Islands, sharks comprised 74% of the top predator biomass (329 g m-2) at Kingman Reef and 57% at Palmyra Atoll (97 g m-2), whereas low shark numbers have been observed at Tabuaeran and Kiritimati.

==Cruising==
Since 2010, the Holland America cruise ships &quot;Rotterdam&quot;, &quot;Westerdam&quot;, &quot;Eurodam&quot;, and &quot;Volendam&quot; have scheduled visits to Tabuaeran. Seaborne Cruiseline has scheduled visits since 2012. The visits help the island regain income lost since Norwegian Cruise Line ceased weekly visits in 2007.

Until 2007, NCL ships based in Honolulu visited Tabuaeran weekly, partly to avoid U.S. port charges for foreign-flagged ships (see Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886). NCL ceased visits after introducing US-flagged ships, changing cruise schedules, and eliminating Tabuaeran as a port of call.

==Education==
The island has three primary schools, one junior secondary school, and one senior secondary school, Meleangi Tabai High School. The government has previously sought to re-open the high school campus on Kiritimati.

==Culture==

Tabuaeran features in John Updike&#x27;s short story &quot;The Blessed Man of Boston, My Grandmother&#x27;s Thimble, and Fanning Island.&quot; It is collected in his books &quot;Pigeon Feathers and Other Stories&quot; and &quot;The Early Stories&quot;.

<doc id="419739" wikidata="Q1375576" url="?curid=419739" title="Tom Zé">
<text>Antônio José Santana Martins (born 11 October 1936), known professionally as Tom Zé (), is a Brazilian singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer who was influential in the Tropicália movement of 1960s Brazil. After the peak of the Tropicália period, Zé went into relative obscurity: it was only in the 1990s, when musician and Luaka Bop label head David Byrne discovered Zé&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Estudando o Samba&quot; and then released reissues of his work, that Zé returned to performing and releasing new material.

==Early life and career==
Tom Zé grew up in the small town of Irará, Bahia in the dry sertão region of the country&#x27;s Northeast. He would later claim that his hometown was &quot;pre-Gutenbergian&quot;, as information was primarily transferred through oral communication. As a child, he was influenced by Brazilian musicians such as Luiz Gonzaga and Jackson do Pandeiro. Zé became interested in music by listening to the radio, and moved to the state capital of Salvador to pursue a degree. He later relocated to São Paulo and began his career in popular music there.

==Career==
Much of his early work involved his wry impressions of the massive metropolitan area, coming as he did, from a small town in the relatively poor northeast.

Influential in the Tropicália movement, Zé contributed, along with Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa, Os Mutantes, and Nara Leão, to the watershed Tropicália album/manifesto &quot;Tropicália: ou Panis et Circenses&quot; (1968). He also participated in a series of concerts with the musicians. After the Brazilian military government of the 1960s began to crack down on the musicians of Tropicália, Zé moved out of the public eye and began to experiment with novel instruments and composition styles. While the other major figures of Tropicália would go on to great commercial and critical success in later decades, Zé slipped into obscurity in the 1970s and 1980s.

==Re-emergence==
In the early 1990s, Zé&#x27;s work experienced a revival when American musician David Byrne discovered one of his albums, &quot;Estudando o Samba&quot; (1975), on a visit to Rio de Janeiro. Zé was the first artist signed to the Luaka Bop label and has so far released a compilation and two albums, all of which received positive reviews from critics in the United States.

In 2011, he collaborated with Javelin on the song &quot;Ogodô, Ano 2000&quot; for the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s most recent charitable album &quot;Red Hot+Rio 2&quot;. The album is a follow-up to the 1996 &quot;Red Hot + Rio&quot;. Proceeds from the sales will be donated to raise awareness and money to fight AIDS, HIV and related health and social issues.

==Style==
Remaining true to the experimental and Dada impulses of Tropicália, Zé has been noted for both his unorthodox approach to melody and instrumentation, employing various objects as instruments such as the typewriter. He has collaborated with many of the concrete poets of São Paulo, including Augusto de Campos, and employed concrete techniques in his lyrics. Musically, his work appropriates samba, Bossa Nova, Brazilian folk music, &quot;forró&quot;, and American rock and roll, among others. He has been praised by avant-garde composers for his use of dissonance, polytonality, and unusual time signatures. Because of the experimental nature of many of his compositions, Zé has been compared with American musicians such as Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart.

One of his last efforts, though, has been a return to Bossa Nova, his &quot;Estudando a Bossa – Nordeste Plaza&quot;. Says Zé: &quot;That music has inhabited my psyche for 50 to 60 years. Familiar and profound, yet somehow extraterrestrial in my mind. It had to come out, to be dealt with.&quot;

* January 15 – Soyuz programme: The Soviet Union launches Soyuz 5.
* January 16 – First successful docking of two crewed spacecraft in orbit and the first transfer of crew from one space vehicle to another (by a space walk) between Soyuz 5 and Soyuz 4.
* January 18 – Failure of Soyuz 5&#x27;s service module to separate correctly causes a near-fatal re-entry (not publicly acknowledged until 1997) but the module makes a hard landing in the Ural Mountains.
* March 3 – Apollo program: NASA launches Apollo 9 to test the lunar module.
* March 13 – Apollo program: Apollo 9 returns safely to Earth after testing the Lunar Module.
* May 16 – Venera program: Venera 5, a Soviet spaceprobe, lands on Venus.
* May 17 – Venera program: Soviet Venera 6 begins to descend into Venus&#x27;, atmosphere sending back atmospheric data before being crushed by pressure.
* May 18 – Apollo program: Apollo 10 launches.
* May 22 – Apollo program: Apollo 10&#x27;s lunar module flies within 15,400 m of the Moon&#x27;s surface.
* May 26 – Apollo program: Apollo 10 returns to Earth after a successful eight-day test of all the components needed for the upcoming first human Moon landing.
* July 17 – &quot;The New York Times&quot; publicly retracts its ridicule of the rocket scientist Robert H. Goddard published on 13 January 1920 which stated that spaceflight is impossible.
* July 20 – Apollo program: 20:17 UTC – The human race, represented by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, lands on the Moon in the Apollo 11 Lunar Module &quot;Eagle&quot;. At 02:56 UTC on July 21 (22:56 ET July 20), Armstrong takes the first human step on the Moon&#x27;s surface. Apollo 11 lifted off for the Moon on July 16 and returns safely on July 24.
* July 21 – Luna programme: 2 hours before the Apollo 11 lunar module lifts off from the Moon&#x27;s surface, the Soviet uncrewed craft Luna 15, launched on July 13 and intended to return samples from the Moon, crashes in Mare Crisium.
* August 5 – Mariner program: Mariner 7 makes its closest fly-by of Mars (3,524 kilometers).

==Biology==
* Thomas D. Brock and Hudson Freeze of Indiana University publish their findings on hyperthermophilic bacteria, most notably &quot;Thermus aquaticus&quot;, a thermophilic bacterium species living at a temperature of 60-80 °C in a hot spring at Yellowstone National Park. &quot;T. aquaticus&quot; (Taq) later becomes a standard source of enzymes able to withstand higher temperatures than those from &quot;E. Coli&quot; and is significant in the history of polymerase chain reaction.
* Last Przewalski&#x27;s Horse sighted in the wild, in Mongolia.
* Marked decline in common whitethroats due to Sahel drought draws attention to effects of climate on migratory species.

* International adoption of the diagnostic term &#x27;Sudden infant death syndrome&#x27;.
* Wolf Wolfensberger publishes &quot;The Origin and Nature of Our Institutional Models&quot;, influential in the move away from a medical model of disability towards the deinstitutionalisation of those with intellectual disability.

==Meteorology==
* Late January – Eugene, Oregon, has a record snowfall of 3 feet in 3 days: a pineapple express moves into the region with a shot of cold air, followed by some snow showers.
* Herbert Saffir and Bob Simpson develop the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.

<doc id="419750" wikidata="Q640785" url="?curid=419750" title="Lone Wolf and Cub">
<text>is a Japanese manga series created by writer Kazuo Koike and artist Goseki Kojima. It was serialized in Futabasha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Manga Action&quot; from September 1970 to April 1976, with its chapters collected in 28 &quot;&quot; volumes. The story was adapted into six films starring Tomisaburo Wakayama, four plays, and a television series starring Kinnosuke Yorozuya, and is widely recognized as an important and influential work.

&quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; chronicles the story of Ogami Ittō, the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s executioner who uses a dōtanuki battle sword. Disgraced by false accusations from the Yagyū clan, he is forced to take the path of the assassin. Along with his three-year-old son, Daigorō, they seek revenge on the Yagyū clan and are known as &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;.

&quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; is considered to be among the most influential manga ever created. It has been cited as the origin for the trope of a man protecting a child on a journey across a dangerous landscape. This is known as the Lone Wolf and Cub trope or genre, which has since inspired numerous books, comics, films, television shows and video games.

==Plot==
Ogami Ittō, formidable warrior and a master of the &quot;suiō-ryū&quot; swordsmanship, serves as the &quot;Kogi Kaishakunin&quot; (the Shōgun&#x27;s executioner), a position of high power in the Tokugawa shogunate during the 1700s. Along with the oniwaban and the assassins, Ogami Ittō is responsible for enforcing the will of the &quot;shōgun&quot; over the &quot;daimyōs&quot; (lesser domain lords). For those samurai and lords ordered to commit &quot;seppuku&quot;, the &quot;Kogi Kaishakunin&quot; assists their deaths by decapitating them to relieve the agony of disembowelment; in this role, he is entitled and empowered to wear the hollyhock crest of the Tokugawa clan, in effect acting in place of the &quot;shōgun&quot;.

After Ogami Ittō&#x27;s wife Azami gives birth to their son, Daigorō, Ogami Ittō returns to find her and all of their household brutally murdered, with only the newborn Daigorō surviving. The supposed culprits are three former retainers of an abolished clan, avenging the execution of their lord by Ogami Ittō. However, the entire matter was planned by Yagyū Retsudō, leader of the Ura-Yagyū &quot;(Shadow Yagyu)&quot; clan, in order to seize Ogami&#x27;s post as part of a masterplan to control the three key positions of power: the spy system, the official assassins and the Shogunate Decapitator. During the initial incursion, an &quot;ihai&quot; (funeral tablet) with the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s crest on it was placed inside the Ogami family shrine, signifying a supposed wish for the shogun&#x27;s death. When the tablet is &quot;discovered&quot; during the murder investigation, its presence condemns Ittō as a traitor and thus he is forced to forfeit his post and is sentenced, along with Daigorō, to commit &quot;seppuku&quot;.

The one-year-old Daigorō is given a choice by his father: a ball or a sword. If Daigorō chose the ball, his father would kill him to send Daigorō to be with his mother; however, the child crawls toward the sword and reaches for its hilt; this assigns him the path of a &quot;rōnin&quot;. Refusing to kill themselves and fighting free from their house imprisonment, father and son begin wandering the country as &quot;demons&quot;—the assassin-for-hire team that becomes known as &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;, vowing to destroy the Yagyū clan to avenge Azami&#x27;s death and Ittō&#x27;s disgrace.

On &quot;meifumadō&quot; (&quot;The Road to Hell&quot;), the cursed journey for vengeance, Ogami Ittō and Daigorō experience numerous adventures. They encounter (and slay) all of Yagyū Retsudō&#x27;s children (both legitimate and illegitimate) along with the entire Kurokuwa ninja clan, eventually facing Retsudō himself. When Retsudō and the Yagyū clan are unable to kill Ittō, the shogunate officially proclaims him and Daigorō outlaws with a price on their heads, authorizing all clans to try and arrest/kill them and permitting anyone to go after them for the bounty. The last duel between Ogami Ittō and Yagyū Retsudō runs 178 pages—one of the longest single fight-scenes ever published in a manga.

Toward the end of their journey, Ogami Ittō&#x27;s &quot;dōtanuki&quot; sword is surreptitiously tampered with and damaged by a supposed sword-polisher who is really an elite &quot;kusa&quot; (&quot;Grass&quot; ninja) of the Yagyū clan. When Ittō is finally attacked by the last of the &quot;kusa&quot;, the sword breaks and Ittō receives wounds that are ultimately fatal. Deadlocked in mid-battle with Retsudō, Ittō&#x27;s spirit leaves his body after years of fatigue and bloodshed, unable to destroy his longtime enemy and ending his path of &quot;meifumadō&quot;.

The story finishes with Daigorō taking up Retsudō&#x27;s broken spear and charging in fury. Retsudō opens his arms, disregarding all defense, and allows Daigorō to drive the spear into his body. Embracing Daigorō with tears, Retsudō names him &quot;grandson of my heart&quot;, closing the cycle of vengeance and hatred between the clans and concluding the epic.

Many of the stories are written in a non-chronological order, revealing different parts of the narrative at different times. For example, Ogami&#x27;s betrayal is not revealed until the end of the first volume, after many stories have already passed.

==Creation and conception==
In crafting a weakness for his protagonist (in order to make the story interesting), writer Kazuo Koike was inspired by the legendary Sigurd, who is made invulnerable by bathing in a dragon&#x27;s blood—except for where a leaf shields part of his back and retains his mortality. The character of Daigorō was created to satisfy this need.

Koike stated in an interview that he crafted the manga to be based upon the characters themselves and that the &quot;essential tension between [Ittō&#x27;s] imperative to meet these challenges while keeping his son with him on the journey&quot; drove the story. According to Koike, &quot;Having two characters as foils of each other is what sets things in motion&quot; and that &quot;If you have a strong character, the storyline will develop naturally, on its own.&quot;

Less than a year after the manga&#x27;s debut, Tomisaburo Wakayama came to Koike to propose starring in the films, to which he immediately agreed.

According to Koike, he knew from the beginning that being killers themselves, both Ogami and Retsudō must die at the end, while Daigorō should survive. Both the producers of the 1970s television series and magazine publisher opposed this, so he had to end his story in his way &quot;without their permission&quot;.

==Characters==

* —The shogun&#x27;s executioner, Ittō decides to avenge the death of his wife, and to restore his clan.
* —The son of Ittō and Azami, Daigorō becomes a stronger warrior as the story progresses.
* —The leader of the Shadow Yagyū clan, Retsudō tries everything in his power to ensure that Ittō dies.
* —The shogun&#x27;s food taster and a master of poisons; originally ordered to assist Retsudō in disposing of Ittō, Tanomo dishonorably tries to kill Ittō, Daigorō and Retsudō in order to seize power for himself. In the original TV series, his character was introduced in Episode 13 of the third series, &quot;Moon of Desire&quot;.

==Media==
===Manga===
====Japan====
Written by Kazuo Koike and illustrated by Goseki Kojima, &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; was serialized in Futabasha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Manga Action&quot;. Its first installment was published on September 10, 1970. The series finished with the 145th installment published on April 1, 1976. Futabasha collected its chapters in 28 volumes, published from May 1972 to May 1976. When &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; was first released in Japan in 1970, it became wildly popular for its powerful, epic samurai story and its stark and gruesome depiction of violence during Tokugawa era Japan. As of October 2006, the manga had sold 8.3 million copies in Japan, and 11.8 million worldwide.

&quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; is one of the most highly regarded manga due to its epic scope, detailed historical accuracy, masterful artwork and nostalgic recollection of the bushido ethos. The story spans 28 volumes of manga, with over 300 pages each (totaling over 8,700 pages in all). Many of the panels of the series are depictions of nature, historical locations in Japan, and traditional activities. A couple of years into the series, a story depicts the fate of Yamada Asaemon, the main character of &quot;Samurai Executioner&quot;, also created by Koike and Kojima. One reviewer notes that Asaemon looks different in this appearance, apparently due to Ogami Ittō having been designed so similarly to the original Asaemon.

====North America====
&quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; was initially released in North America in a translated English edition by First Comics in 1987. The monthly series of comic-book-sized issues featured covers by Frank Miller, Bill Sienkiewicz, Matt Wagner, Mike Ploog, and Ray Lago. Sales were initially strong but fell sharply as the company went into a general decline. First Comics shut down in 1991 without completing the series, publishing less than a third of the total series over 45 issues.

Starting in September 2000, Dark Horse Comics began to release an English translation of the full series in 28 smaller-sized trade paperback volumes with longer page-counts (from 260 to over 300 pages), similar to the volumes published in Japan. Dark Horse completed the presentation of the entire series, fully translated, with the publication of the 28th volume in December 2002. Dark Horse reused all of Miller&#x27;s covers from the First Comics edition, as well as several done by Sienkiewicz, and commissioned Wagner, Guy Davis, and Vince Locke to produce new covers for several volumes of the collections. In October 2012, Dark Horse completed the release of all 28 volumes in digital format, as part of their &quot;Dark Horse Digital&quot; online service.

====Volumes====
====Dark Horse Omnibus collected editions====

Starting in May 2013, Dark Horse began publishing their translated editions of &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; in value-priced Omnibus editions.

Partial volumes collected in Omnibus form are marked with an asterisk (*).

====Sequels and follow-up series====
In 2002, a &quot;reimagined&quot; version of the story, &quot;Lone Wolf 2100&quot;, was created by writer Mike Kennedy and artist Francisco Ruiz Velasco with Koike&#x27;s indirect involvement. The story was a post-apocalyptic take on the tale with several differences, such as a female cub and a worldwide setting: Daisy Ogami, daughter of a renowned scientist, and Itto, her father&#x27;s cybernetic bodyguard and Daisy&#x27;s subsequent protector, attempt to escape from the Cygnat Owari Corporation&#x27;s schemes.

Dark Horse announced at the 2006 New York Comic Con that they had licensed &quot;New Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;, Kazuo Koike and Hideki Mori&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;, starring Ogami Itto&#x27;s son Daigoro, the famous child in the baby cart. In this new series, which picks up immediately after the climactic battle of the original series, the bodies of Ogami Itto and Yagyu Retsudo are left lying on the beach with Daigoro left alone standing over his father&#x27;s body (since no one, for political reasons, dares to bury either body or take charge of Daigoro). A bearded samurai, Tōgō Shigetada of the Satsuma clan and master of the &quot;Jigen-ryū&quot; style of swordsmanship (based on the actual historical personage Tōgō Shigetaka, creator of &quot;Jigen-ryū&quot;), wanders onto the battlefield and assists Daigoro with the cremation/funeral of Ogami Itto and Yagyu Retsudo. Tōgō, who is on a training journey and also carries a &quot;dotanuki&quot; sword similar to Ogami&#x27;s (and crafted by the same swordsmith), then assumes guardianship of Daigoro, including retrieving the baby cart and teaching/training Daigoro in &quot;Jigen-ryū&quot;.

The two soon become enmeshed in a plot by the Shogunate conceived by the ruthless Matsudaira Nobutsuna and spearheaded by his chief henchman Mamiya Rinzō (also based on an actual historical character) to topple the Satsuma clan and assume control of that fiefdom&#x27;s great wealth, using Tōgō as an unwitting pawn. When Tōgō discovers that he has been tricked and used, he and Daigoro embark on the road of &quot;meifumado&quot; in a quest to kill the Shogun (which would force Matsudaira out into the open). However, Rinzō, who is not only a master of disguise but also Matsudaira&#x27;s natural son, may have an even more devious plan of his own, including subverting the Shogun&#x27;s own ninja and using opium to ensnare and enslave the Shogun himself. This series also introduces non-Japanese characters into the plotlines. Dark Horse began publishing the follow-up series, &quot;New Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;, in June 2014; the eleventh and last volume was released in December 2016.

A second sequel series, titled (, ), was serialized in ″s manga magazine &quot;Jin&quot; from January 20, 2007, until the magazine&#x27;s last issue, released on May 21, 2008. The series resumed on ″s online manga magazine &quot;Katana&quot; on April 14, 2009, and finished on July 20, 2010. Five volumes were released by Koike Shoin from July 27, 2007, to September 28, 2012. This series has not currently been translated into English.

===Films===
A total of six &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; films starring Tomisaburo Wakayama as Ogami Ittō and Tomikawa Akihiro as Daigoro were produced based on the manga. They are also known as the &quot;Sword of Vengeance&quot; series, based on the English-language title of the first film, and later as the &quot;Baby Cart&quot; series, because young Daigoro travels in a baby carriage pushed by his father.

The first three films, directed by Kenji Misumi, were released in 1972 and produced by Shintaro Katsu, Wakayama&#x27;s brother and the star of the 26-part &quot;Zatoichi&quot; film series. The next three films were produced by Wakayama himself and directed by Buichi Saitō, Kenji Misumi, and Yoshiyuki Kuroda, released in 1972, 1973, and 1974, respectively. Wakayama quit making the films after the popular television series began to air.

&quot;Shogun Assassin&quot; (1980) was an English language compilation for the American audience, edited mainly from the second film, with 11 minutes of footage from the first. Also, the third film, &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub: Baby Cart to Hades&quot; was re-released on DVD in the US under the name &quot;Shogun Assassin 2: Lightning Swords of Death&quot;.

In 1992 the story was again adapted for film, &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub: Final Conflict&quot; also known as &quot;Handful of Sand&quot; or &quot;A Child&#x27;s Hand Reaches Up&quot; (&quot;Kozure Ōkami: Sono Chiisaki te ni&quot;, literally &quot;In That Little Hand&quot;), directed by Akira Inoue and starring Masakazu Tamura as Ogami Itto.

In addition to the six original films (and &quot;Shogun Assassin&quot; in 1980), various television movies have aired in connection with the television series as pilots, compilations or originals. These include several starring Kinnosuke Yorozuya (see section &quot;Television series&quot;), in 1989 a TV movie called &quot;Lone Wolf With Child: An Assassin on the Road to Hell&quot; better known as &quot;Baby Cart In Purgatory&quot; where Hideki Takahashi plays Ogami Ittō and Tomisaburo Wakayama co-stars as Retsudo Yagyu.

====Hollywood remake====
In the 2000s, Darren Aronofsky attempted to get an official Hollywood version of &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; off the ground, but could not secure the rights.

In March 2012, Justin Lin was announced as the director on an American version of &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;. In June 2016, it was announced that producer Steven Paul had acquired the rights, and in October 2017, it was announced that Andrew Kevin Walker was writing the script.

===Television series===

Two full-fledged television series based on the manga have been broadcast to date.

The first, &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; (&quot;Kozure Ōkami&quot;), was produced in a typical jidaigeki format and broadcast for three seasons from 1973 to 1976, each episode 45 minutes long. Season one originally aired 27 episodes, but the original 2nd episode &quot;Gomune Oyuki (Oyuki of the Gomune)&quot; was subsequently deleted from all rebroadcasts in Japan and VHS and DVD releases; the reasons why this episode has been excluded are currently unclear. Seasons two and three ran for 26 episodes each. Kinnosuke Yorozuya played Ogami Ittō, and later reprised the role in a 1984 TV movie; Daigoro was played by Katzutaka Nishikawa in the first two seasons and by Takumi Satô in the final season.

The series was co-produced by Union Motion Picture Co, Ltd. (ユニオン映画) and Studio Ship (スタジオシップ), a company formed by manga author Kazuo Koike, and originally aired on Nippon TV in Japan. It was subsequently broadcast in the United States as &quot;The Fugitive Samurai&quot; in the original Japanese with English subtitles, and released for the Toronto, Canada market by CFMT-TV (now OMNI 1) in the original Japanese with English subtitles as &quot;The Iron Samurai&quot;. It has also been aired in Germany dubbed in German, in Italy dubbed in Italian; around 1980, a Portuguese dub was aired in Brazil as &quot;O Samurai Fugitivo (The Fugitive Samurai)&quot; on TVS, actually SBT, and in Spanish, as &quot;El Samurai Fugitivo&quot; on the American Spanish TV station Univision.

The first season was released on DVD in Japan on December 20, 2006, apparently without subtitles. Twelve of the first 13 episodes were released on DVD in Germany as &quot;Kozure Okami&quot;, with audio in Japanese and German. In the U.S., Media Blasters released the first season on DVD on April 29, 2008, under its Tokyo Shock Label, containing the original Japanese with English subtitles. All of these releases excluded the deleted-from-distribution second episode &quot;Gomune Oyuki&quot;.

The latest television series, also titled &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; (&quot;Kozure Ōkami&quot;), aired from 2002 to 2004 in Japan on TV Asahi with Kin&#x27;ya Kitaōji in the role of Ogami Ittō and Tsubasa Kobayashi as Daigoro. This series has not yet been made commercially available on DVD or Blu-ray; however, beginning in September 2023 English-subtitled episodes began being uploaded to the YouTube website, courtesy of the &quot;Samurai vs. Ninja&quot; YouTube Channel, and currently all three seasons of the series have been uploaded.

===Games===
In 1987, video game manufacturer Nichibutsu released a beat &#x27;em up arcade video game based on the series, named &quot;Kozure Ōkami&quot; in Japan and &quot;Samurai Assassin&quot; overseas. Players guide Ogami Itto through an army of assassins while carrying his infant son on his back. A baby cart powerup enables Ookami to mow down enemies with blasts of fire. The game was only released in arcades.

In 1989, Mayfair Games published &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub Game&quot;, a board game designed by Matthew Costello based on the franchise. GM Magazine reviewed the game, highlighting the illustrations, well-written encounters, and sturdy components; however, the reviewer found that the basic rules and limited options made for a dull experience on repeat plays.

In the 2001 PlayStation 2 video game &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; by Square Enix, there is an aeon named Yojimbo, a being the summoner Yuna can summon to battle, along with his dog Daigoro. He must be paid the game&#x27;s form of money to use attacks varying in strength and weapon. With his design resembling that of Ancient Japanese designs, his worker-employer relationship with Yuna, the aesthetic with his weaponry and mannerisms, and the name of his dog, many elements from Ittō were used to design this summon.

In 2012, a pachinko game adaptation called &quot;Kozure Ōkami&quot; was released in Japan.

===Library requests===
By 1990, many libraries understood the rise of graphic novels as a medium. Many were advised to purchase copies of various graphic novels to keep up public demand, listing many popular publications. One of the most prominent graphic novels listed was &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub,&quot; focusing on the Japanese elements in the storytelling. They would continue to add the volumes of the graphic novel well into 2003.

==Influence==
&quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; is considered to be among the most influential manga ever created, having inspired numerous artists, animators and filmmakers across the world, as well as creating the &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; trope.

&quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; has influenced American comics, notably Frank Miller in his &quot;Sin City&quot; and &quot;Ronin&quot; series. Other examples of artists inspired by it include filmmakers such as Hong Kong action cinema&#x27;s John Woo when he produced &quot;Heroes Shed No Tears&quot; (1986), American comic book artists such as Justin Jordan and Mike Kennedy, and animators such as Russia&#x27;s Genndy Tartakovsky. Indian comic-book writer Suhas Sundar acknowledged that he drew some inspiration from &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; to create his &quot;Odayan&quot; comic book series.

Homages to &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; have appeared in many works. Examples include a 1973 television commercial for Momoya chansai seasoning, episode 77 of the anime series &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; (1983), &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot; episode 22 (2005), &quot;Gintama&quot; episode six (2006), the third season of &quot;Crayon Shin-chan Gaiden&quot; (2017) subtitled &quot;Kazokukure Ōkami&quot; (&quot;Lone Wolf and Family&quot;), &quot;Busō Shōjo Machiavellism&quot; episode six (2017), &quot;Hug! Pretty Cure&quot; episode 44 (2018), and &quot;Rick and Morty: The Anime&quot; episode &quot;Samurai &amp; Shogun&quot; (2020).

===Lone Wolf and Cub trope===
&quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; has been cited as the origin for the narrative trope/genre where a man, skilled in violence, protects a child on a journey across a dangerous landscape. Known as the Lone Wolf and Cub trope or genre, it has since been used in numerous works, with examples including films such as &quot;Léon: The Professional&quot; (1994) and &quot;Logan&quot; (2017), television shows such as &quot;Stranger Things&quot; and &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, and media franchises such as &quot;The Witcher&quot; and &quot;The Last of Us&quot;.

The samurai anime film &quot;Sword of the Stranger&quot; (2007) has been described as &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; meets &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;. There are also variations of the Lone Wolf and Cub trope involving a mother and daughter, with examples including films such as &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; (2020) and &quot;Gunpowder Milkshake&quot; (2021).

Novelist Max Allan Collins acknowledged the influence of &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; on his graphic novel &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; (1998). In an interview to the BBC, Collins declared that &quot;&quot;Road to Perdition&quot; is &#x27;an unabashed homage&#x27; to &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;&quot;. In turn, writer Neil Druckmann cited &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; as a direct influence on &quot;The Last of Us&quot; video game (2013) and television show (2023); &quot;The Last of Us&quot; actor Pedro Pascal cited &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; as the origin of the trope of a man protecting a child on a journey across a dangerous landscape.

&quot;Wolf and Cub&quot; is an episode from the first season of the TV series &quot;Person of Interest&quot;; the title is assumed to be inspired by &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;. Themes of vengeance and being a rōnin are interspersed throughout the episode.

Episode 20 of the fifth season of the television series &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot;, &quot;Hawk &amp; Chick&quot;, is a parody inspired by &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;. A follow-up episode, &quot;The Hawkening: Look Who&#x27;s Hawking Now!&quot; from the show&#x27;s tenth season, features a missing scene that parallels the suppressed episode of the 1973 &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; TV series.

The &quot;Star Wars&quot; streaming series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; has a premise influenced by &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;, with the titular character guarding an alien child from various threats. The &quot;Mandalorian&quot; spin-off series &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot; includes a scene modeled on Daigorō&#x27;s choice between ball and sword as depicted in &quot;Sword of Vengeance&quot;. &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot; also uses a variation of the trope.

The Lone Wolf and Cub trope has also been used in numerous video games. Examples include the adaptation &quot;Kozure Ōkami&quot; (1987), &quot;Hanjuku Hero 4&quot; (2005) by Square Enix, &quot;The Witcher&quot; series, &quot;The Last of Us&quot;, Hideo Kojima&#x27;s &quot;Death Stranding&quot; (2019), and FromSoftware&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (2019).

<doc id="419751" wikidata="Q3115080" url="?curid=419751" title="Great Dark Spot">
<text>The Great Dark Spot (also known as GDS-89, for Great Dark Spot, 1989) was one of a series of dark spots on Neptune similar in appearance to Jupiter&#x27;s Great Red Spot. In 1989, GDS-89 was the first Great Dark Spot on Neptune to be observed by NASA&#x27;s &quot;Voyager 2&quot; space probe. Like Jupiter&#x27;s spot, the Great Dark Spots are anticyclonic storms. However, their interiors are relatively cloud-free, and unlike Jupiter&#x27;s spot, which has lasted for hundreds of years, their lifetimes appear to be shorter, forming and dissipating once every few years or so. Based on observations taken with &quot;Voyager 2&quot; and since then with the Hubble Space Telescope, Neptune appears to spend somewhat more than half its time with a Great Dark Spot. Little is known about the origins, movement, and disappearance of the dark spots observed on the planet since 1989.

== Characteristics ==
The Great Dark Spot was captured by NASA&#x27;s &quot;Voyager 2&quot; space probe in Neptune&#x27;s southern hemisphere. The dark, elliptically shaped spot (with initial dimensions of 13,000 × 6,600 km, or 8,100 × 4,100 mi), was about the same size as Earth, and was similar in general appearance to Jupiter&#x27;s Great Red Spot. One major difference compared to Jupiter&#x27;s Great Red Spot is that Neptune&#x27;s Great Dark Spot has shown the ability to shift north-south over time, while the Great Red Spot is held in the same latitudinal region by global east-west wind currents. Around the edges of the storm, winds were measured at up to 2,100 kilometers per hour (1,300 mph), the fastest recorded in the Solar System. The Great Dark Spot is thought to be a hole in the methane cloud deck of Neptune. The spot was observed at different times with different sizes and shapes.

The Great Dark Spot generated large white clouds at or just below the tropopause layer similar to high-altitude cirrus clouds found on Earth. Unlike the clouds on Earth, however, which are composed of crystals of water ice, Neptune&#x27;s cirrus clouds are made up of crystals of frozen methane. These high altitude clouds are located somewhere between 50–100 km (30–60 miles) above the main cloud deck. While cirrus clouds usually form and then disperse within a period of a few hours, the clouds in the Great Dark Spot were still present after 36 hours, or two rotations of the planet.

Neptune&#x27;s dark spots are thought to occur in the troposphere at lower altitudes than the brighter upper cloud deck features. As they are stable features that can persist for several months, they are thought to be vortex structures.

== Disappearance ==
When the spot was to be photographed again in November 1994 by the Hubble Space Telescope, it had disappeared completely, leaving astronomers to believe that it had either been covered up or had vanished. The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature. Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator, or possibly through some other unknown mechanisms.

== Other dark spots observed ==
Following the Great Dark Spot, several other dark spots have been observed. In 1989, when the Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot (GDS), a second dark spot, Dark Spot 2 (DS2) was found. Dark Spot 2 fully dissipated prior to the year 1994. Beginning in 1994, the Hubble became the only operating facility to detect the presence and observe dark spots on Neptune and is still used to the present day. Hubble is able to view images at blue wavelength, which is the only way features are visible. In 1994, a Northern Dark Spot (NGDS-1994) formed in the northern hemisphere and disappeared between 1998 and 2000. The storm for its duration showed to be stable in latitude. In 1996, a separate Northern Dark Spot (NGDS-1996) formed and was observed until its disappearance, which occurred prior to 1998. Similarly to the prior dark spot, this one exhibited little to no meridional drift. In 2015, a Southern Dark Spot (SDS) was discovered by the Hubble Outer Planet Atmosphere Legacy (OPAL) program. The Southern Dark Spot exhibited a poleward drift before its disappearance in 2017. In 2016, an almost identical spot as the Great Dark Spot (GDS) emerged in Neptune&#x27;s northern hemisphere. This new spot, called the Northern Great Dark Spot (NGDS), has remained visible for several years. It is unknown whether this spot is still present on the planet, as observations using the Hubble telescope are limited.

More recently, in 2018, a newer main dark spot and a smaller dark spot were identified and studied. This discovery of the dark spot in Neptune&#x27;s northern hemisphere was monumental in that it was the first dark spot that the Hubble Telescope was able to document from birth. The storm is much smaller in comparison than the one discovered by NASA&#x27;s Voyager 2, but was found to be larger in diameter than the Atlantic Ocean at approximately 4,600 miles across. In August 2020, the new Great Dark Spot suddenly stopped its southward motion and reversed direction, contrary to projections that the storm would continue to the equator, where it would have met its likely demise. It is believed that the storms remain stable in the northern hemisphere due to the effect of Coriolis forces. However, as the storms moved towards the equator, the Coriolis forces weakened, causing the storms to dissipate.

Around the same time, a smaller &quot;Dark Spot Jr.&quot; was found near the larger storm, before disappearing later on. Dark Spot Jr. as the name suggests was smaller than the prior dark spot, only measuring 3,900 miles in diameter. The coincidental appearance of this storm led astronomers to believe that the prior storm&#x27;s reversal of motion may have been related to the birth of the smaller storm.

While the formation of the storms is still under investigation, it had been concluded from observations regarding the Southern Dark Spot (SDS-2015) and Northern Great Dark Spot (NGDS-2018) that their origins are preceded by an increase in cloud activity in the given region 2–3 years prior to becoming visible. The storms from 1989–2018 have exhibited different movement patterns and are generally only visible for a few years. Furthermore, the disappearance of dark spots including the Southern Dark Spot can be linked to companion clouds reaching the center of the storm and blocking the view of the blue wavelengths that are used to track the vortex, prior to their disappearance.

== Proposed missions ==
Two mission ideas have been proposed to NASA to visit Neptune in the coming years. Trident was proposed in 2021 as a discovery mission to visit Neptune and its moon Triton in the year, but two missions to Venus (DAVINCI+ and VERITAS) were selected over it. Neptune Odyssey is a flagship orbiter mission concept with similar goals as Trident and is targeted for a launch date of 2033. These missions have a high focus on learning more about Neptune&#x27;s largest moon Triton, but also aim to gain more information about the atmosphere of Neptune. An analysis of a nuclear-electric propulsion mission to Neptune was published by the China National Space Administration.

<text>This Is Wonderland is a Canadian legal comedy-drama television series that premiered on CBC on January 12, 2004. The series was created by George F. Walker, Dani Romain, and Bernard Zukerman.

The second season premiered on January 25, 2005, and the third season on November 23, 2005. On February 13, 2006, CBC declined to order a fourth season, effectively cancelling the show. The final episode aired on March 15, 2006.

==Plot==
Alice De Raey, played by Cara Pifko, a young criminal lawyer fresh out of Osgoode Hall Law School, is thrown into a chaotic justice system. She encounters characters ranging from the truly desperate to the bizarre. Alice, with a good-natured openness that cloaks a tenacious, committed spirit, finds herself on a journey that constantly tests her patience and compassion. Alice has a distinctive habit of muttering to herself.

Set in the courtrooms of Toronto&#x27;s Old City Hall, cast regulars include Michael Riley, Michael Murphy, Michael Healey, Siu Ta, Eric Peterson, Janet-Laine Green and Kathryn Winslow. Jayne Eastwood and Ron Lea joined the cast in 2005.

In addition to Alice&#x27;s education in the real world of low rent criminal justice, distinctive features of the Wonderland courtroom include respectful treatment of the mental health concerns of both defendants and the authority figures (judges and lawyers) faced with the contradictions of the system and the multicultural nature of Toronto society. Events in many of the characters&#x27; lives overwhelm their ability to emotionally cope and the shortcomings of the &quot;blunt instrument&quot; of the judicial system to address those situations are fully explored. Language and cultural barriers routinely figure into the course of justice, raising questions about the ability of the judicial system to respond to the needs of a changing society.

<doc id="419757" wikidata="Q1499199" url="?curid=419757" title="Gekiga">
<text>is a style of Japanese comics aimed at adult audiences and marked by a more cinematic art style and more mature themes. &quot;Gekiga&quot; was the predominant style of adult comics in Japan in the 1960s and 1970s. It is aesthetically defined by sharp angles, hatching, and gritty lines, and thematically by realism, social engagement, maturity, and masculinity.

==History==
In the 1950s, mainstream Japanese comics (manga) came from Tokyo and were aimed at children, led by the work of Osamu Tezuka. Before Tezuka moved to Tokyo, he lived in Osaka and mentored artists such as Yoshihiro Tatsumi and Masahiko Matsumoto who admired him. Although influenced by Tezuka&#x27;s adaptation of cinema techniques, they were not interested in making humoristic comics for children in Tezuka&#x27;s Disney-esque style. They wanted to write consistently dramatic stories with aesthetics influenced by film noir and crime novels. &quot;Gekiga&quot; were more graphic and showed more violence than the children&#x27;s manga that came before them. Tatsumi explained, &quot;Part of that was influenced by the newspaper stories I would read. I would have an emotional reaction of some kind and want to express that in my comics.&quot; The name &quot;gekiga&quot; was coined in 1957 by Tatsumi and adopted by other more serious Japanese cartoonists, who did not want their trade to be known by the more common term &quot;manga&quot;, meaning &quot;whimsical pictures&quot;.

Irma Nunez of &quot;The Japan Times&quot; wrote that &quot;rather than simply use &#x27;gekiga&#x27; as a banner to legitimize adult content and realism in manga, ... they developed a whole new aesthetic.&quot; Matsumoto&#x27;s son said that these artists felt that the shorter stories Tezuka started writing after moving to Tokyo, narrowed his expression as action needed to be explained in speech bubbles. Nunez explained, &quot;Structural integrity was one of the pioneers&#x27; primary concerns. They experimented with how best to blend images with the text; how a closeup might express the interiority of a character; how to synchronize a story&#x27;s action with the pace of the reader&#x27;s gaze as it covered the page&quot;.
Rather than working for the mainstream publications, the &quot;gekiga&quot; artists worked in the rental manga industry; where the work of several artists were printed in collections, that readers borrowed as opposed to buying. In November 1956, Masahiko Matsumoto used the term to describe his work &quot;Kyūketsu-jū&quot;, instead of manga. Matsumoto&#x27;s son later claimed this work was the basis for what would later be known as &quot;gekiga&quot;. Yoshihiro Tatsumi&#x27;s work &quot;Yūrei Taxi&quot; was the first to be called &quot;gekiga&quot; when it was published at the end of 1957. Other names he considered include &quot;katsudōga&quot; and &quot;katsuga&quot;, both derived from &quot;katsudō eiga&quot; or &quot;moving pictures&quot;, an early term for films, showing the movement&#x27;s cinematic influence.

In 1959, the formed in Tokyo with eight members, including Tatsumi, Matsumoto, and Takao Saito. The group wrote a sort of &quot;Gekiga Manifesto&quot; that was sent to various publishers and newspapers declaring their mission. The Gekiga Kōbō disbanded in 1960 over internal divisions; although as an organized group it was very short-lived, its influence was long lasting.

The avant-garde magazine &quot;Garo&quot;, founded in 1964, was an outlet for experimental and unconventional works that were &quot;visually or thematically too challenging for the mainstream market&quot;. With works like Sanpei Shirato&#x27;s &quot;Kamui&quot;, it quickly gained a following among college students. In response to the success of &quot;Garo&quot;, Tezuka founded the magazine &quot;COM&quot; in 1967 for more experimental works.
By the late 1960s and early 1970s, the children who had grown up reading manga wanted something aimed at older audiences and &quot;gekiga&quot; catered to that niche. The Cartoon Museum describes the &quot;gekiga&quot; audience: &quot;Drawn in a more realistic and atmospheric style with grittier story lines, gekiga attracted older teenagers, university students and eventually adult readers.&quot; That particular generation came to be known as the &quot;manga generation&quot; because it read manga as a form of rebellion, which was similar to the role that rock music played for hippies in the United States.

Some authors use the term &quot;gekiga&quot; to describe works that only have shock factor. In 1968, Tatsumi published &quot;Gekiga College&quot; because he felt &quot;gekiga&quot; was straying too far from its roots and wanted to reclaim its meaning. In 2009, he said, &quot;Gekiga is a term people throw around now to describe any manga with violence or eroticism or any spectacle. It&#x27;s become synonymous with spectacular. But I write manga about households and conversations, love affairs, mundane stuff that is not spectacular. I think that&#x27;s the difference.&quot;

The Cartoon Museum wrote that by the 1980s, &quot;gekiga&quot; became integrated into various types of manga. &quot;For some younger people the term gekiga is now consigned to the history books, but its legacy lives on.&quot;

For a long time &quot;gekiga&quot; was not translated into other languages, but after 2000 more and more publishers dedicated to graphic novels began translating and releasing &quot;gekiga&quot;. More recently, publishers like Drawn &amp; Quarterly began publishing several English editions of works by Tatsumi and Yoshiharu Tsuge, among others, increasing the exposure of the genre in the Western graphic novel market.

<doc id="419760" wikidata="Q6410717" url="?curid=419760" title="Kinesis (band)">
<text>Kinesis were an alternative rock band from Bolton, England. The group formed in September 2000 whilst at school, and split after five years in June 2005. During this time they recorded two full studio albums, a mini album and several singles under three record labels.

==Members==
The band consisted of Michael Bromley (vocals, guitar), Neil Chow (drums, vocals), Tom Marshall (bass guitar, vocals) and Conor McGloin (guitar)

==Recording history==
Their first recording was the five track, self-released EP, &quot;The Flowers Are Dead&quot;, which was followed up by a mini-album, &quot;Worship Yourself&quot;. This mini-album was released on the band&#x27;s own &#x27;White Noise Recordings&#x27; record label. At that time, the ages of the band ranged from 16 to 18. Rave reviews of &quot;Worship Yourself&quot; in publications such as &quot;Kerrang!&quot; helped the band build up a dedicated, if small, fan base in the UK. The band signed a recording contract with Independiente in 2002.

They released their first full-length album &quot;Handshakes For Bullets&quot; in September 2003 on Independiente. The band toured the UK on a number of occasions, and also played concerts in New York City (as part of the CMJ music festival), Texas (as part of the South By Southwest festival) and Tokyo. Kinesis played concerts supporting numerous bands, the most prominent of which were; Linkin Park, Muse, Manic Street Preachers, Biffy Clyro, Hundred Reasons and Lostprophets. They also performed on a number of their own headline tours.

The band parted with Independiente, in mid-2004. Their second album &quot;You Are Being Lied to&quot; was released in June 2005 on the indie label Captains of Industry. The album was recorded and produced by the band themselves on a tight budget.

==Artistic comparisons==
Kinesis were often compared to the Manic Street Preachers, because of their politically minded lyrics. Their first album covered subjects such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), euthanasia, as well as their views on the social habits of the British people, especially the younger generation to which they belong. The band were also known for their uniform style of dark blue jeans and white T-shirts.

==Split==
The band split up amicably on the day that the latter album was released. Thus, many of the songs from the album were never performed live.

<text>Asylum Street Spankers was an American acoustic blues and roots rock band from Austin, Texas, United States. The band played cover versions of early jazz and comical, often risqué original songs.

In 2006, the band&#x27;s satirical antiwar video &quot;Stick Magnetic Ribbons on Your SUV&quot; surpassed 1 million views in two months on YouTube. In January 2011 the band won the 10th Annual Independent Music Awards in the Gospel category for &quot;God&#x27;s Favorite Band&quot;. The band dissolved after a final tour in spring 2011.

== History ==
===Founding===
The band was founded by Christina Marrs, William David &quot;Wammo&quot; Walker, and Guy Forsyth after a party at the Dabbs Hotel near the Llano River in Texas in 1994. The band began by busking on the streets of Austin and playing for tips in bars. In their earliest days, the Spankers&#x27; repertoire consisted almost entirely of country, blues, jazz, swing, and Tin Pan Alley songs from the 1890s to the 1950s, with an emphasis on the 1920s and 1930s. The band developed a raucous and irreverent sound, focusing on musicianship and theatricality. Several early members were actors and nearly all members have been multi-instrumentalists. Until 2004 they played most of their concerts without amplification.

The band derived its name from Austin&#x27;s Guadalupe Street, where they would often busk and where they played early shows. At one time Guadalupe Street was nicknamed &quot;Asylum Street&quot; because it led to a state psychiatric hospital. According to Christina Marrs, spanking&#x27; is an old jazz term for playing your instrument vigorously. But we still like the other connotation of spanking as well.&quot;

===Lineup changes, studio albums===
With the departure of Guy Forsyth in 1997 the Spankers began playing their own songs, most of them in the roots styles the band was familiar with. By 1999 only Marrs and Wammo remained of the original line-up.

Reconstructing the band, Marrs and Wammo began including more cross-genre experimentation, intricate arrangements, vocal harmonies, and humorous songs, sometimes with pointed social and cultural commentary. Also in 1999, Marrs and Wammo founded Spanks-a-Lot Records to release their music.

In 2006, the satirical antiwar video &quot;Stick Magnetic Ribbons on Your SUV&quot; received 1,054,743 views on YouTube. The video was directed by Morgan Higby Night.

In January 2008 the group premiered its stage show &quot;What? And Give Up Show Biz?&quot; off-Broadway at the Barrow Street Theatre. In January 2011, Asylum Street Spankers won the 10th Annual Independent Music Awards in the Gospel category for &quot;God&#x27;s Favorite Band&quot;.

=== Breakup, farewell tour ===
After the band broke up in 2010, the remaining members announced one last tour, nine months in 50 cities: &quot;Spanks for the Memories! The Farewell Tour.&quot; Down to one founding member, the band built a new show around Marrs, Newman, and returning member Charlie King. The &quot;Spanks for Everything&quot; Farewell Tour concluded with a series of final shows in Austin on April 20–23, 2011.

In March 2011, the band raised over $20,000 from fans in order to create a DVD retrospective and documentary centered around their final performances in Austin.

In April 2014, an album with previous unreleased recordings of their last shows, &quot;The Last Laugh&quot;, was released. In 2015, &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; won the award for the &quot;Live Performance Album&quot; category at The 14th Annual Independent Music Awards.

==Style==
&quot;Spanker Madness&quot; is an album of country blues songs that praise marijuana use and criticize the War on Drugs, though other songs look at the negative side of recreational drugs. &quot;Mercurial&quot; was recorded using technology from the 1940s. &quot;My Favorite Record&quot; is about their love of music. &quot;Mommy Says No!&quot; is an album of songs about children and childhood that was inspired by children&#x27;s authors Shel Silverstein and Maurice Sendak.

The Spankers have covered songs by Prince, Tom Waits, Bob Dylan, Beastie Boys, The B-52&#x27;s, Black Flag, Louis Armstrong, Bessie Smith, Harry Nilsson, The Jazz Butcher, The Violent Femmes, George Jones, Nirvana, Nina Simone, Nine Inch Nails, Oingo Boingo, Otis Redding, Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins, and Johnny Cash.

<doc id="419765" wikidata="Q1160312" url="?curid=419765" title="Visual J Sharp">
<text>Visual J# (pronounced &quot;jay-sharp&quot;) is a discontinued implementation of the J# programming language that was a transitional language for programmers of Java and Visual J++ languages, so they could use their existing knowledge and applications with the .NET Framework. It was introduced in 2002 and discontinued in 2007, with support for the final release of the product continuing until October 2017.

J# worked with Java bytecode as well as source so it could be used to transition applications that used third-party libraries, even if their original source code was unavailable. It was developed by the Hyderabad-based Microsoft India Development Center at HITEC City in India.

The implementation of Java in Visual J++, MSJVM, did not pass Sun&#x27;s compliance tests leading to a lawsuit from Sun, Java&#x27;s creator, and creation of J#. Microsoft ceased such support for the MSJVM on December 31, 2007 (later Oracle bought Sun, and with it Java and its trademarks). Microsoft however, officially started distributing Java again in 2021 (though not bundled with Windows or its web browsers as before with J++), i.e. their build of Oracle&#x27;s OpenJDK, which Microsoft plans to support for at least 6 years, for LTS versions, i.e. to September 2027 for Java 17.

==Fundamental differences between J# and Java==
Java and J# use the same general syntax but there are non-Java conventions in J# to support the .NET environment. For example, to use .NET &quot;properties&quot; with a standard JavaBean class, it is necessary to prefix getter and setter methods with the Javadoc-like annotation:

/** @beanproperty */

…and change the corresponding private variable name to be different from the suffix of the getXxx/setXxx names.

J# does not compile Java-language source code to Java bytecode (.class files), and does not support Java applet development or the ability to host applets directly in a web browser, although it does provide a wrapper called Microsoft J# Browser Controls for hosting them as ActiveX objects. Finally, Java Native Interface (JNI) and raw native interface (RNI) are substituted with P/Invoke; J# does not support remote method invocation (RMI).

&quot;InfoWorld&quot; said: &quot;J#&#x27;s interface to the .NET framework is solid, but not as seamless as C#. In particular, J# code cannot define new .NET attributes, events, value types, or delegates. J# can make use of these language constructs if they are defined in an assembly written in another language, but its inability to define new ones limits J#&#x27;s reach and interoperability compared to other .NET languages.&quot;

Contrariwise, Microsoft documentation for Visual Studio 2005 details the definition of .NET delegates, events, and value types directly in J#.

==History of J#==
In January 2007, Microsoft announced:

* That Microsoft would produce an updated version of Visual J# 2.0, including a 64-bit redistributable version, called J# 2.0 Second Edition to meet customer demand for 64-bit runtime support. Microsoft released Visual J# 2.0 Second Edition in May 2007.
* Retirement of the J# language and Java Language Conversion Assistant from future versions of &quot;Visual Studio&quot;. The last version, shipping with Visual Studio 2005, was supported until 2015.
* Calling J# code from .NET 4.0 code would fail unless vjsnativ.dll was pre-loaded.

The download of Visual J# 2005 Express Edition is no longer available from Microsoft&#x27;s website.

Visual J# is out of support including the Visual J# 2.0 Redistributable Second Edition released in 2007, that was supported through to 2017 &quot;(5 years mainstream and 5 years extended support) on EN-US locales.&quot;
