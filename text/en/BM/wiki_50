<text>The laser diode rate equations model the electrical and optical performance of a laser diode. This system of ordinary differential equations relates the number or density of photons and charge carriers (electrons) in the device to the injection current and to device and material parameters such as carrier lifetime, photon lifetime, and the optical gain.

The rate equations may be solved by numerical integration to obtain a time-domain solution, or used to derive a set of steady state or small signal equations to help in further understanding the static and dynamic characteristics of semiconductor lasers.

The laser diode rate equations can be formulated with more or less complexity to model different aspects of laser diode behavior with varying accuracy.

==Multimode rate equations==
In the multimode formulation, the rate equations model a laser with multiple optical modes. This formulation requires one equation for the carrier density, and one equation for the photon density in each of the optical cavity modes:

:formula_1
:formula_2

where: 
N is the carrier density, P is the photon density, I is the applied current, e is the elementary charge, V is the volume of the active region, formula_3 is the carrier lifetime, G is the gain coefficient (s−1), formula_4 is the confinement factor, formula_5 is the photon lifetime, formula_6 is the spontaneous emission factor, formula_7 is the radiative recombination time constant, M is the number of modes modelled, μ is the mode number, and 
subscript μ has been added to G, Γ, and β to indicate these properties may vary for the different modes.

The first term on the right side of the carrier rate equation is the injected electrons rate (I/eV), the second term is the carrier depletion rate due to all recombination processes (described by the decay time formula_3) and the third term is the carrier depletion due to stimulated recombination, which is proportional to the photon density and medium gain.

In the photon density rate equation, the first term ΓGP is the rate at which photon density increases due to stimulated emission (the same term in carrier rate equation, with positive sign and multiplied for the confinement factor Γ), the second term is the rate at which photons leave the cavity, for internal absorption or exiting the mirrors, expressed via the decay time constant formula_5 and the third term is the contribution of spontaneous emission from the carrier radiative recombination into the laser mode.

==The modal gain==
Gμ, the gain of the μth mode, can be modelled by a parabolic dependence of gain
on wavelength as follows:

:formula_10

where:
α is the gain coefficient and ε is the gain compression factor (see below). λμ is the wavelength of the μth mode, δλg is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the gain curve, the centre of which is given by

:formula_11

where λ0 is the centre wavelength for N = Nth and k is the spectral shift constant (see below). Nth is the carrier density at threshold and is given by

:formula_12

where Ntr is the carrier density at transparency.

βμ is given by
:formula_13

where

β0 is the spontaneous emission factor, λs is the centre wavelength for spontaneous emission and δλs is the spontaneous emission FWHM. Finally, λμ is the wavelength of the μth mode and is given by

:formula_14

where δλ is the mode spacing.

==Gain Compression==

The gain term, G, cannot be independent of the high power densities found in
semiconductor laser diodes. There are several phenomena which cause the gain to
&#x27;compress&#x27; which are dependent upon optical power. The two main phenomena are
spatial hole burning and spectral hole burning.

Spatial hole burning occurs as a result of the standing wave nature of the optical
modes. Increased lasing power results in decreased carrier diffusion efficiency which
means that the stimulated recombination time becomes shorter relative to the carrier
diffusion time. Carriers are therefore depleted faster at the crest of the wave causing a
decrease in the modal gain.

Spectral hole burning is related to the gain profile broadening mechanisms such
as short intraband scattering which is related to power density.

To account for gain compression due to the high power densities in semiconductor lasers, the gain equation is modified such that it becomes related to the inverse of the optical power. Hence, the following term in the denominator of the gain equation :

:formula_15

==Spectral Shift==

Dynamic wavelength shift in semiconductor lasers occurs as a result of the change
in refractive index in the active region during intensity modulation. It is possible to
evaluate the shift in wavelength by determining the refractive index change of the active
region as a result of carrier injection. A complete analysis of spectral shift during direct
modulation found that the refractive index of the active region varies proportionally to carrier density and hence the wavelength varies proportionally to injected current.

Experimentally, a good fit for the shift in wavelength is given by:

:formula_16

where I0 is the injected current and Ith is the lasing threshold current.

<doc id="418359" wikidata="Q954080" url="?curid=418359" title="Hideki Matsui">
<text>, nicknamed &quot;[[Godzilla]]&quot;, is a Japanese former professional baseball outfielder and designated hitter. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Oakland Athletics, Tampa Bay Rays, and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Yomiuri Giants. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed.

Matsui played the first 10 seasons of his career in Japan for NPB&#x27;s Yomiuri Giants. During that span, he was a nine-time All-Star, three-time Japan Series champion, and three-time Central League Most Valuable Player (MVP). In 2003, Matsui transitioned to playing in MLB in North America, and spent his first seven seasons there with the New York Yankees. As a Yankee, he was a two-time All-Star and 2009 World Series champion, for which he was named the World Series MVP. He is the only Asian player to win the award in league history. After becoming a free agent, Matsui had one-year stints with three other MLB teams: the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Oakland Athletics, and Tampa Bay Rays. On July 28, 2013, Matsui signed a one-day minor league contract with the Yankees in order to officially retire with the team.

During his 20-year playing career, Matsui hit 507 home runs, 332 in NPB and 175 in MLB. In 2018, Matsui was inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Hideki Matsui was born in Neagari, Ishikawa, Japan (later merged into Nomi, Ishikawa). According to an interview on YES Network&#x27;s &quot;CenterStage&quot;, Matsui originally batted right-handed as a child. However, when he started playing with his older brother and his friends, Matsui was such a good hitter that his embarrassed brother insisted that he bat left-handed or stop playing with them. Matsui soon became an overpowering left-handed batter, thereafter batting left-handed.

Matsui was recruited by Seiryo High School in Kanazawa, Ishikawa, a Western Honshu baseball powerhouse. During his high school years, Matsui participated in four National High School Baseball Tournaments at Koshien Stadium (once in the spring and three times in the summer). In 1992, he drew five consecutive intentional walks in a game at Koshien and became a nationwide topic of conversation. The intentional walks were considered excessive and unsportsmanlike but the strategy worked, as Matsui&#x27;s team lost. Matsui&#x27;s reaction to the intentional walks was widely commented upon by the media. &quot;Matsui&#x27;s stoic, emotionless conduct during those at-bats drew great praise from tournament officials and reporters alike&quot;, author Robert Whiting wrote. At the end of the tournament, a representative of the High School Federation declared that &quot;All students should learn from Matsui&#x27;s attitude.&quot;

==Professional career==
===Yomiuri Giants===
Following high school Matsui was drafted by the Yomiuri Giants in the first round. He was given the uniform number 55, which was the single-season home run record held by Sadaharu Oh.

Matsui&#x27;s first three seasons were unspectacular. His breakout season came in 1996, when he batted .314 with 38 home runs and 99 RBIs. A three-time MVP in the Japanese Central League (1996, 2000, and 2002), Matsui led his team into four Japan Series, winning three titles (1994, 2000 and 2002). He also made nine consecutive all-star games and led the league in home runs and RBIs three times (1998, 2000, and 2002). His single season mark for home runs was 50 in 2002, his final season in Japan. In the ten seasons he played in Japan, Matsui totalled 1268 games played, 4572 AB, 1390 hits, 901 runs, 332 home runs, 889 RBIs, a .304 batting average, and a .582 slugging percentage. His streak of 1,250 consecutive games played was the second longest in Japan.

His first trip to the Japan Series became well-known. Because of the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, Matsui became known to the American media, as media outlets were covering the Series, which was referred in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; as &quot;the&quot; Fall Classic.

In Japan, Matsui earned the popular nickname &quot;Godzilla.&quot; The origin of the name is derisive in nature, in reference to Matsui&#x27;s skin problems early on in his career, but has since come to represent his powerful hitting. In 2002, he made a cameo in the film &quot;Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla.&quot;

In 2001, Matsui turned down a $64 million, six-year offer from the Yomiuri Giants, the highest in NPB history.

===New York Yankees===

Matsui signed a three-year, $21 million contract with the Yankees on December 19, 2002. A parade was held for him in Tokyo to celebrate his signing with the Yankees and many reporters and photographers followed him to MLB from his home in Tokyo.

On March 31, 2003, Matsui made his MLB debut against Toronto Blue Jays in Canada. He became the first Japanese player who made his MLB debut in Canada. He hit an RBI single in his first MLB at-bat and, at the 2003 Yankee home opener, he became the first Yankee to hit a grand slam in his first game at Yankee Stadium. Matsui went on to hit .287 with 16 home runs and 106 RBIs. On defense, he led the AL in errors by an outfielder, with eight. In the 2003 MLB postseason, he became the first Japanese player to hit a home run in the World Series, in Game Two of the 2003 World Series against the Florida Marlins.

Matsui narrowly lost the Rookie of the Year Award to Ángel Berroa after two writers, Jim Souhan and Bill Ballou, refused to include him on their ballots due to his age. Yankees owner George Steinbrenner responded by pointing out this had not prevented either writer from voting for Ichiro Suzuki or Kazuhiro Sasaki, both of whom had previously played in the NPB for several years and were the two oldest players to have received the award, and stated he felt Matsui had been robbed.
In his second season, Matsui finished 2004 with a .298 average with 31 home runs and 108 RBIs. He was the American League All-Star Final Vote winner in 2004. In 2005, Matsui set MLB career highs with a .305 average and 116 RBIs.

On November 15, 2005, Matsui signed a four-year deal for $52 million, surpassing Ichiro Suzuki as the highest paid Japanese player in baseball, and securing his place with the Yankees through 2009. In 2006, Matsui finished his fourth season with a .302 average with eight home runs and 29 RBIs after missing most of the season due to a wrist injury.

On May 6, 2007, Matsui recorded his 2,000th hit in combined hits in NPB and MLB during a game vs. the Mariners, which earned him a place in Japan&#x27;s Golden Players Club, reserved for players who have hit 2,000 hits, have 200 wins or have 250 saves professionally. It was originally ruled an error on Raúl Ibañez, who lost track of the ball due to the sun, but a scoring change gave Matsui the hit. Matsui went 2-for-4 that day; the second hit (#2001) was a clean single to right field. On August 5, 2007, Matsui became the first Japanese player in MLB history to hit 100 home runs. The home run came in the bottom of the third inning off Gil Meche of the Kansas City Royals.

In 2007, he was third in the AL with 10 sacrifice flies, and ninth in walks per strikeout (1.00). In the winter of 2007, it was widely reported in the media that the Yankees were in talks to send Matsui to the San Francisco Giants in exchange for one or two pitchers. No deal ever materialized and Matsui remained with the Yankees.

On June 12, 2008, Matsui hit a grand slam on his 34th birthday, helping the Yankees to a 4–1 victory over the A&#x27;s. Later that month, Matsui went on the disabled list with knee pain. He returned on August 19 against the Toronto Blue Jays and became the team&#x27;s everyday designated hitter. After the final game at Yankee Stadium, Matsui underwent surgery on his left knee. Through 2008, Matsui batted .294 against right-handed pitchers in his career and .295 against lefties.

On June 12, 2009, Matsui hit a three-run home run on his 35th birthday, giving the Yankees a 7–6 lead over the New York Mets in the sixth inning. On July 20, he hit a walk-off solo home run with one out in the bottom of the ninth against Jim Johnson of the Baltimore Orioles, giving the Yankees their fourth win in a row after the All Star break, their ninth walk-off win, and a tie for first place in the division with the Boston Red Sox. A month later, on August 21, Matsui hit two home runs and drove in a career-high seven runs in the Yankees&#x27; unusual 20–11 win over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. He became the first Yankees hitter to ever drive in seven runs in a game at Fenway Park since Lou Gehrig in 1930. Two games later, Matsui would hit two home runs for his third time in just seven games. Matsui was voted by fans as MLB Clutch Performer of the Month Presented by Pepsi for August after his performance through the month. On September 19, Matsui hit his 26th home run of the season, breaking the Yankees&#x27; record for home runs in a single season by a designated hitter which was previously held by Don Baylor.
In the 2009 World Series, Matsui helped the Yankees defeat the defending champion Philadelphia Phillies in six games by hitting .615 (8-for-13) with three home runs and 8 RBI, including tying Bobby Richardson&#x27;s single-game World Series record (Game 3 of the 1960 World Series) with six RBIs in Game 6. Since the designated hitter position was not used in the three games in Philadelphia, Matsui only started the three games in New York; nevertheless, his performance earned him the World Series Most Valuable Player Award. He became the first Japanese-born player to win the award, as well as the first player to win it as a full-time designated hitter in the World Series. He joined his 1994 Japan Series teammate Dan Gladden (1987 and 1991, Minnesota) as players to have won championships in both North America and Japan. Matsui also became the third player in Major League history to bat .500 or above and hit three home runs in the same World Series, joining only Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.

===Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim===

On December 16, 2009, Matsui agreed to a one-year deal with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim worth $6.5 million. He told Yomiuri Shimbun that he &quot;loved the Yankees the best&quot; but that he no longer felt valued and when his agent called to negotiate, &quot;The Yankees had nothing prepared [in terms of contract conditions].&quot; He made up his mind to sign with the Angels quickly. &quot;I really felt their high expectations of me&quot;, he said. &quot;They also acknowledged that I want to give fielding a shot.&quot;

On Opening Day of the 2010 season, Matsui went 2-for-4 with a home run in the Angels cleanup spot. While playing in 145 games for the Angels, he produced a .274 batting average, 21 home runs and 84 RBIs. Matsui returned to free agent status following the close of the season, and on November 23, 2010, the Angels announced that they would not offer him salary arbitration.

===Oakland Athletics===

On December 14, 2010, Matsui signed a one-year contract worth $4.25 million with the Oakland Athletics for the 2011 season. On April 3, 2011, Matsui collected career hit number 2,500 (between NPB and MLB) at Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum versus the Seattle Mariners, and on July 20, 2011, Matsui hit career home run number 500 versus the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park.

===Tampa Bay Rays===

On April 30, 2012, Matsui signed a minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Rays. He joined the Rays&#x27; Triple-A affiliate, the Durham Bulls, on May 15, 2012. On May 28, 2012, it was reported that the Rays were going to call Matsui up for a game against the Chicago White Sox on May 29, 2012. Upon joining the Rays, due to his preferred number 55 belonging to pitcher Matt Moore, he elected to wear uniform number 35 for his former teammate Mike Mussina. On the first pitch of his second at bat against the Chicago White Sox on May 29, 2012, Matsui hit a two-run home run.

In 2012, there were thirty-five members of the Japanese media assigned to report on Matsui.

However, Matsui&#x27;s hitting was unimpressive during the next two months as he posted a .147 batting average. He was designated for assignment by the Rays on July 25, 2012, and was released on August 1. Upon playing for the Rays, Matsui succeeded in playing 10 top-tier professional seasons in both America (MLB) and Japan (NPB), the first player in history to do so.

==Retirement==

On December 27, 2012, Matsui officially announced his retirement from baseball. His retirement ceremony was held on May 5, 2013, at the Tokyo Dome, during which the Japanese government awarded him, and Shigeo Nagashima with the People&#x27;s Honour Award.

On July 28, 2013, Matsui signed a one-day contract with the New York Yankees, and formally retired as a member of the team, the Yankees organization granting his last wish in honor of his years as a successful player with the team. In 2015, Matsui rejoined the Yankees as a special adviser to general manager Brian Cashman.

On January 15, 2018, Matsui was elected to the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame with 91.3% of the vote. Elected at the age of 43, he became the youngest player to be inducted to the Hall, breaking a record held by Hideo Nomo.

Matsui was one of the torchbearers in the 2020 Summer Olympics.

==Playing streak==
Matsui did not miss a game in his first three seasons with the Yankees, putting together a streak of 518 games played. Before that, he played in 1,250 consecutive games with Yomiuri, for a total professional baseball streak of 1,768. Matsui holds the record for longest streak of consecutive games played to start a Major League Baseball career.

On May 11, 2006, in his 519th game with the Yankees, Matsui fractured his left wrist on an unsuccessful sliding catch in the top of the first inning against the Boston Red Sox. Matsui, despite the injury, threw the ball back to the infield before gripping his wounded wrist in obvious pain. The game did not count toward Matsui&#x27;s streak, as a player must field for at least half an inning or take an at-bat to be credited with a game played (MLB rule 10.24). Matsui underwent surgery on May 12, 2006, the next day. He returned to the Yankees starting lineup on September 12 against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, and had an RBI-single in his first at-bat back, and proceeded to go 4 for 4 with a walk and scored twice.

==Philanthropy==

Matsui donated $500,000 towards charity relief for victims of the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.

Matsui also donated $620,000 to relief efforts for victims of the 2011 earthquake, tsunami, and subsequent Fukushima nuclear disaster in the Tōhoku region of Japan. On March 21, 2015, Matsui and former teammate Derek Jeter held a baseball charity event to support children affected by the 2011 earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster, at the Tokyo Dome. The event included a baseball clinic and a home run derby between Matsui and Jeter.

==Personal life==
Matsui announced to the press on March 27, 2008, that he had married in a private ceremony in New York. His bride&#x27;s name was not announced, but it was reported that she was 25 years old and had been formerly working in a &quot;reputable position at a highly respected company&quot;. They met in Japan after the 2006 off-season. Matsui&#x27;s first son was born in the United States around the time of his retirement. , Matsui had an apartment in the Upper West Side of Manhattan and a home in Connecticut where he was raising his son. In January 2017, his wife gave birth to the couple&#x27;s second son. He continues to live in New York City as of 2021.

<text>A 2-8-8-4 steam locomotive, under the Whyte notation, has two leading wheels, two sets of eight driving wheels, and a four-wheel trailing truck. The type was generally named the &quot;Yellowstone&quot;, a name given it by the first owner, the Northern Pacific Railway, whose lines ran near Yellowstone National Park. Seventy-two Yellowstone-type locomotives were built for four U.S. railroads.

Other equivalent classifications are:
*UIC classification: 1DD2 (also known as German classification and Italian classification)
*French classification: 140+042
*Turkish classification: 45+46
*Swiss classification: 4/5+4/6
*Russian classification: 1-4-0+0-4-2

The equivalent UIC classification is, refined for simple articulated locomotives, (1′D)D2′.

A locomotive of this length must be an articulated locomotive. All Yellowstones had fairly small drivers of . (For greater speeds, the Union Pacific Railroad chose a four-wheel leading truck and drivers of for its Big Boy 4-8-8-4 class.)

Several classes of Yellowstone, especially the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range&#x27;s locomotives, are among the largest steam locomotives, with the exact ranking depending on the criteria used.

==Northern Pacific==
The Northern Pacific Railway was the first railroad to order a 2-8-8-4. The first was built in 1928 by American Locomotive Company; at the time, it was the largest locomotive ever built. It had the largest firebox ever applied to a steam locomotive, some in area, to burn Rosebud coal, a cheap low-quality coal. But the firebed was too large for the available draft and the fire burned poorly and developed under 5,000 horsepower. The problem was mitigated by blocking off the first few feet of the grates. Baldwin Locomotive Works built 11 more for the Northern Pacific in 1930. No examples have been preserved.

==Southern Pacific==
The Southern Pacific Railroad&#x27;s famous &quot;cab forward&quot; articulated steam locomotives were effectively a Yellowstone in reverse (4-8-8-2). This was done to spare the crew from the heavy smoke output of the large engines on the former Central Pacific, where tunnels and snow sheds were common and lengthy. One is on display at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento. The ready availability of fuel oil in California made them possible. The SP also owned some conventional 2-8-8-4s for use in areas where coal was plentiful and snow sheds were rare. Lima Locomotive Works built 12 AC-9 class locomotives in 1939; they had skyline casings with striped pilots. At first, they burned coal but were later converted to oil. None were saved.

==Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range==

The Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway hauled iron ore in Minnesota. Iron ore is heavy and the DM&amp;IR operated long trains of ore cars, requiring maximum power. These locomotives were based upon ten 2-8-8-2s that Baldwin had built in the 1930s for the Western Pacific Railroad. The need for a larger, coal-burning firebox and a longer, all-weather cab led to the use of a four-wheel trailing truck, giving them the &quot;Yellowstone&quot; wheel arrangement. They were the most powerful Yellowstones built, producing of tractive effort, and had the most weight on drivers so that they were less prone to slipping.

Eight locomotives (class M-3) were built by Baldwin in 1941. The Yellowstones met or exceeded the DM&amp;IR specifications, so 10 more were ordered (class M-4). The second batch was completed in late 1943 after the Missabe&#x27;s seasonal downturn in ore traffic, so some of the new M-4s were leased to and delivered directly to the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad.

The next winter, the D&amp;RGW again leased the DM&amp;IR&#x27;s Yellowstones as helpers over Tennessee Pass, Colorado, and for other freight duties. The Rio Grande returned the Yellowstones after air-brake failure caused No. 224 to wreck on the Fireclay Loop. This was despite the Rio Grande&#x27;s earlier assessment that these Yellowstones were the finest engines ever to operate there.

DM&amp;IRs were the only Yellowstones to have a high-capacity pedestal or centipede tender, and had roller bearings on all axles. Some of the locomotives had a cylindrical Elesco feedwater heater ahead of the smoke stack, while others had a Worthington unit with its rectangular box in the same location.

Only one Yellowstone was retired before dieselization took place on the Missabe; No. 237 was sold for scrap after a wreck. The rest of the 2-8-8-4s were retired between 1958 and 1963 as diesel locomotives took over.

Of the eighteen built, three survive and are on display in Minnesota: No. 225 at Proctor, No. 227 at the Lake Superior Railroad Museum in Duluth and No. 229 at Two Harbors.
==Baltimore and Ohio==

When the U.S. entered World War II The American railroads saw increases in traffic. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, along with other railroads, wanted to purchase more of the diesel locomotives since they were showing improved performance over steam locomotives. But the War Production Board regulated the production of steam and diesel locomotives until the war emergency was over. So, along with producing 40 new class T-3 4-8-2 type locomotives built in-house at its Mt. Clare shops in Baltimore, Maryland, the B&amp;O took delivery of 30 class EM-1 Yellowstones in 1944 and 1945, the largest number and the smallest of this type built by Baldwin as well as the most modern.

The EM-1 produced of tractive effort on drivers with steam pressure and four cylinders. The tender carried of water and 25 tons of coal. The engine weighed while the tender weighed for a combined . Nothing bigger could operate within the tunnel clearances and track restrictions on the B&amp;O&#x27;s main line.

They were equipped with the newest technology, including the Worthington feedwater heater, superheater with front-end throttle, Cyclone front end, thermic syphons, a lateral cushioning device in the front pair of drivers on both engines and the front wheels and the trailing truck, as well as roller bearings on all axles, engine and tender, which gave them the reputation of &quot;yard creepers&quot;, because three men could move one on a level track with the cylinder cocks open.

B&amp;O&#x27;s president, Roy B. White, after inspecting the first one delivered, said to the general superintendent of motive power and equipment, A.K. Galloway, &quot;Well, I must say, they have everything!&quot;

Fleet numbers 7600–7619 were built and delivered in 1944 and 7620–7629 in 1945, all by the Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They went to work on the Cumberland Division&#x27;s rugged West End subdivision with its more than 2% grades and tight curves, where with the older 2-8-8-0 EL classes, they hauled West Virginia coal and freights. Since the EM-1s had roller bearings throughout, they also handled mail and express trains, replacing two B&amp;O class T-3 4-8-2 Mountains. That continued until January 21, 1947, when, near Oakland, Maryland, train 29 with engine 7625 derailed with the locomotive rolling onto the engineer&#x27;s side, killing the engineer. The EM-1s were then restricted to coal and freight trains until the late 1950s, when the B&amp;O used EM-1 No. 7600 for railfan trips.

The EM-1s also ran on the Pittsburgh Division over Sand Patch Grade near Meyersdale, Pennsylvania, with empty hoppers, iron ore or dolomite loads westbound, coal eastbound, as well as general freight in both directions. In the late 1950s, the B&amp;O used EM-1 No. 7600 for railfan trips mostly between Cumberland, MD, and Connellsville, PA. Well-known photographer and Cumberland, MD native William P. Price captured, on still pictures and 8mm films, the EM-1s on the east side of Sand Patch pulling heavy trains with two of the B&amp;O&#x27;s 2-10-2 class S1 and S1a Big Sixes on the rear as helpers dispatched from Hyndman, PA. 
Near the end of steam they were all sent out to Fairmont and Wheeling, West Virginia, and Lorain, Ohio, with lake-bound coal trains as well as runs between Willard, OH and Garrett, Indiana, until the B&amp;O started to retire them in 1957, and all of them were scrapped. Two locomotives were formerly preserved. No. 650 (7600) has earmarked for preservation by the B&amp;O Railroad Museum in Baltimore. However, a yard master who completely misunderstood why it has to be moved, thought it was supposed to be scrapped, and the yard master ordered No. 650 to the scrapyard and broken up. As a result, he was fired by them for being a moron. No. 659 (7609) was offered to the city of Wheeling, West Virginia, for static display, but they denied the offer, and broken up. Thus, none of the EM-1s survive today.

==Outside the United States==

The metre-gauge Central Railway of Brazil took delivery of four 2-8-8-4s from the German firm of Henschel in 1937. They were the only narrow gauge locomotives of this wheel arrangement. They had the largest boilers ever used on a narrow-gauge simple expansion locomotive.

Soviet Russia constructed two 2-8-8-4 locomotives at the Kolomna Locomotive Works. These were the P38 Class numbers P38.001 and P38.002. The first locomotive carried partial casings over the boiler and smokebox typical of the 1950s. P38.002 bore no such adornments and had a more conventional appearance. Both engines had tenders with part bogie and part fixed frame similar to the American &#x27;centipede&#x27; tenders.

<doc id="418364" wikidata="Q868018" url="?curid=418364" title="Cloaking">
<text>Cloaking is a search engine optimization (SEO) technique in which the content presented to the search engine spider is different from that presented to the user&#x27;s browser. This is done by delivering content based on the IP addresses or the User-Agent HTTP header of the user requesting the page. When a user is identified as a search engine spider, a server-side script delivers a different version of the web page, one that contains content not present on the visible page, or that is present but not searchable. The purpose of cloaking is sometimes to deceive search engines so they display the page when it would not otherwise be displayed (black hat SEO). However, it can also be a functional (though antiquated) technique for informing search engines of content they would not otherwise be able to locate because it is embedded in non-textual containers, such as video or certain Adobe Flash components. Since 2006, better methods of accessibility, including progressive enhancement, have been available, so cloaking is no longer necessary for regular SEO.

Cloaking is often used as a spamdexing technique to attempt to sway search engines into giving the site a higher ranking. By the same method, it can also be used to trick search engine users into visiting a site that is substantially different from the search engine description, including delivering pornographic content cloaked within non-pornographic search results.

Cloaking is a form of the doorway page technique.

A similar technique is used on DMOZ web directory, but it differs in several ways from search engine cloaking:
* It is intended to fool human editors, rather than computer search engine spiders.
* The decision to cloak or not is often based upon the HTTP referrer, the user agent or the visitor&#x27;s IP; but more advanced techniques can be also based upon the client&#x27;s behaviour analysis after a few page requests: the raw quantity, the sorting of, and latency between subsequent HTTP requests sent to a website&#x27;s pages, plus the presence of a check for robots.txt file, are some of the parameters in which search engines&#x27; spiders differ heavily from a natural user behaviour. The referrer tells the URL of the page on which a user clicked a link to get to the page. Some cloakers will give the fake page to anyone who comes from a web directory website, since directory editors will usually examine sites by clicking on links that appear on a directory web page. Other cloakers give the fake page to everyone &quot;except&quot; those coming from a major search engine; this makes it harder to detect cloaking, while not costing them many visitors, since most people find websites by using a search engine.

==Cloaking versus IP delivery==
IP delivery can be considered a more benign variation of cloaking, where different content is served based upon the requester&#x27;s IP address. With cloaking, search engines and people never see the other&#x27;s pages, whereas, with other uses of IP delivery, both search engines and people can see the same pages. This technique is sometimes used by graphics-heavy sites that have little textual content for spiders to analyze.

One use of IP delivery is to determine the requester&#x27;s location, and deliver content specifically written for that country. This isn&#x27;t necessarily cloaking. For instance, Google uses IP delivery for AdWords and AdSense advertising programs to target users in different geographic locations.

IP delivery is a crude and unreliable method of determining the language in which to provide content. Many countries and regions are multilingual, or the requestor may be a foreign national. A better method of content negotiation is to examine the client&#x27;s codice_1 HTTP header.

<text>Assistant professor is an academic rank just below the rank of an associate professor used in universities or colleges, mainly in the United States, Canada, Japan, and South Korea.

==Overview==
This position is generally taken after earning a doctoral degree and sometimes after several years of holding one or more postdoctoral researcher positions. It is below the position of associate professor at most universities and is equivalent to the rank of lecturer at most Commonwealth universities. In the United States, assistant professor is often the first position held in a tenure track, although it can also be a non-tenure track position. A typical professorship sequence is assistant professor, associate professor, and full professor in order. After seven years, if successful, assistant professors can get tenure and also get promotion to associate professor.

There is high demand for vacant tenure-track assistant professor positions, often with hundreds of applicants. Less than 20% of doctoral graduates move onto a tenure-track assistant professor position after graduation.

Educational Qualifications for Assistant Professor in India 

The candidate should have completed a post-graduate degree (Master’s degree) with 55% marks in aggregate in the relevant field or discipline from a recognized university.

UGC NET qualified

OR Ph.D. degree Holder with or without NET

The eligibility criteria, age limit, and educational qualifications may vary depending on the specific requirements of the university or institute where the position is available. It is advisable to check the official notification of the concerned university/institute for detailed information.

==Comparison==

The table presents a broad overview of the traditional main systems, but there are universities that use a combination of those systems or other titles. Some universities in Commonwealth countries have also entirely adopted the North American system in place of the Commonwealth system.

<doc id="418375" wikidata="Q9344260" url="?curid=418375" title="Associate professor">
<text>Associate professor is an academic title with two principal meanings: in the North American system and that of the &quot;Commonwealth system&quot;.

==Overview==
In the &quot;North American system&quot;, used in the United States and many other countries, it is a position between assistant professor and a full professorship. In this system, an associate professorship is typically the first promotion obtained after gaining a faculty position, and in the United States it is usually connected to tenure.

In the &quot;Commonwealth system&quot;, the title associate professor is traditionally used in place of reader in certain countries. Like the reader title it ranks above senior lecturer – which corresponds to associate professor in the North American system – and is broadly equivalent to a North American full professor, as the full professor title is held by far fewer people in the Commonwealth system. In this system, an associate professorship is typically the second or third promotion obtained after gaining an academic position, and someone promoted to associate professor has usually been a permanent employee already in their two previous ranks as lecturer and senior lecturer. Traditionally, British universities have used the title reader, while associate professor &quot;in place of reader&quot; is traditionally used in Australia and New Zealand, South Africa, Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, and Ireland within an otherwise British system of ranks. More recently, the university of Cambridge has adopted the North American system of ranks.

<doc id="418376" wikidata="Q3566048" url="?curid=418376" title="Freedom of the seas">
<text>Freedom of the seas is a principle in the law of the sea. It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans. It also disapproves of war fought in water. The freedom is to be breached only in a necessary international agreement.

This principle was one of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points proposed during the First World War. In his speech to the Congress, the president said:

The United States&#x27; allies Britain and France were opposed to this point, as the United Kingdom was also a considerable naval power at the time. As with Wilson&#x27;s other points, freedom of the seas was rejected by the German government.

Today, the concept of &quot;freedom of the seas&quot; can be found in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea under Article 87(1) which states: &quot;the high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked&quot;. Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research.

==Historical background==

Between the end of the 15th century up until the 17th century various powers claimed sovereignty over parts of the sea. In 1609, Dutch jurist and philosopher Hugo Grotius wrote what is considered the foundation of international legal doctrine regarding the seas and oceans – &quot;Mare Liberum&quot;, a Latin title that translates to &quot;freedom of the seas&quot;. The Grotian concept of &quot;freedom of the sea&quot; was only accepted after a century long debate between Grotius&#x27; ideas and John Selden″s.

While it is generally assumed that Grotius first propounded the principle of freedom of the seas, countries in the Indian Ocean and other Asian seas accepted the right of unobstructed navigation long before Grotius wrote his &quot;De Jure Praedae&quot; (&quot;On the Law of Spoils&quot;) in the year of 1604. Previously, in the 16th century, Spanish theologian Francisco de Vitoria postulated the idea of freedom of the seas in a more rudimentary fashion under the principles of &quot;jus gentium&quot;.

During World War II, nations started to expand and claim many resources and water territories all over their surrounding coasts. There were four international treaties meticulously drafted in the late 1950s and onto the 1970s, but the issues were not resolved between nations until 1982 when the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was introduced.

UNCLOS is a Law of the Sea treaty: an agreement of rights and responsibilities of nations and their use of the world&#x27;s ocean with guidelines of trade, environment, and the management of marine and open seas resources. UNCLOS replaced the four international treaties drafted in the late 1950s through 1970s. As of 2013, 165 countries and the European Union have joined the convention.

==High seas and registration==
According to international law, Article 92 of the convention which describes ships shall sail under the flag of one state only and, save in exceptional cases expressly provided for in international treaties or in this convention, shall be subject to its exclusive jurisdiction on the high seas; however, when a ship is involved in certain criminal acts, such as piracy, any nation can exercise jurisdiction under the doctrine of universal jurisdiction. High seas were defined as any part of the sea that was not either territorial sea or internal waters, territorial waters and exclusive economic zones. Article 88 of the 1982 Convention states that the high seas shall be reserved for peaceful purposes. Many countries engage in military maneuvers and the testing of conventional weapons and nuclear weapons on the high seas.
In order to deliver the right punishment to the right person or state, ships must be registered to a country to show proof of ownership. The owner of the vessel sometimes prefers to pay the lower registration fees by picking countries such as Panama, Bermuda, Italy, Malta and the Netherlands. According to Cruise Lines International Association, 90% of commercial vessels calling on U.S. ports fly foreign flags. To avoid the high cost with more rules and regulations, ships and tankers sometime prefer lower cost registration with a lower standard of inspection and regulation by picking a country that exercises less control over their registered ships, though many ships are owned by individuals or companies in another country (most commonly Japan and Greece) under a system called &quot;flag of convenience&quot;. Registering a ship in Panama means that the ship is governed by the maritime rules of Panama rather than the ship owner&#x27;s country. Ship owners do this because Panama has low taxes and fewer labor and safety regulations than most other countries. Ship owners can make their staff work longer hours in less safe environments, and therefore maximize their profits. Other countries, including Liberia, Cyprus and the Bahamas also offer flags of convenience, but Panama has the most ships registered under the scheme. Ships registered with the US will cost more, and the employee wages will be even higher. Freedom of the seas allows a ship to move freely on the ocean as long as it follows international law.

==Trade opportunities==
From the Vikings to the European, Central Asia, Africa and North and South America, trade has served an important role in history, and has been a key factor of a growing economy. Trade transfers the ownership of goods from one person or entity to another by getting a product or service in exchange from the buyer. When a ship sets sail, there may be many ports waiting for it to bring goods from all over the world for trade and sale. Free trade opening up markets to foreign suppliers increases competition. Without free trade, domestic companies may have enjoyed monopolies or oligopolies that enabled them to keep prices well above marginal costs. Trade liberalization will undermine that market power.

The Merchant Marine Act of 1920, also known as the Jones Act (46 USC § 883) is a maritime law that controls coastal trade within the United States and determines which ships may lawfully engage in that trade and the rules under which they must operate. The act is in place to protect jobs for US citizens and its people working at U.S. ports, and on U.S. vessels. Many vessels around the globe sail under many different flags, and have different crews from different parts of the world where the pay rate is much lower than the U.S. The Jones Act protects the Americans&#x27; jobs and restricts coastwise transportation of passengers. 46 USC § 12108 additionally restricts the use of foreign vessels to commercially catch or transport fish in U.S. waters.

<doc id="418377" wikidata="Q1266283" url="?curid=418377" title="Senior lecturer">
<text>Senior lecturer is an academic rank. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Switzerland, Germany, and Israel &quot;senior lecturer&quot; is a faculty position at a university or similar institution. The position is tenured (in systems with this concept) and is roughly equivalent to an associate professor in the North American system.

==Overview==
Especially in research-intensive universities, lecturers lead research groups and supervise research students, as well as teach. After a number of years, lecturers might be promoted to senior lecturers with increasing research, leadership, and administrative responsibilities. In most research-intensive universities in the United Kingdom (such as those that are part of the Russell Group and 1994 Group), a senior lecturer position is between a lecturer and a reader, with a strong focus on research. At the same time, in some universities (for instance, University of Leeds), the rank of reader is no longer used for new appointments. A senior lecturer position can be a parallel position to reader in other universities. In some universities (notably post-1992 UK universities and former polytechnics), the senior lecturer and reader ranks denote different responsibilities, with the former being more teaching-focused and the latter being more research-focused. Senior lecturers can progress to either a reader or a professor position.

==Commonwealth and European usage==
In most UK, New Zealand, Australian, Swiss and Israeli universities, there are ranks equivalent to senior lecturer (&quot;Oberassistent&quot; or &quot;Akademischer Oberrat&quot; in German, &quot;Chargé de cours&quot; in French, or &quot;מרצה בכיר&quot; in Hebrew), all being roughly comparable to the level of &quot;associate professor&quot; in North American universities, and &quot;lecturer&quot; is roughly equivalent to the North American &quot;assistant professor&quot;. The ranks &quot;Lecturer&quot; and &quot;Senior Lecturer&quot; (without a translation into German) are also increasingly being adopted by universities in Germany and the German-speaking part of Switzerland. It is used for some members of academic staff with permanent positions.

Some British universities (for instance, Nottingham and Warwick) have recently decided to adopt the North American ranks of assistant and associate professor instead of lecturer and senior lecturer/reader. Some UK universities (for example, Plymouth University) use the rank of associate professor to denote the rank between a lecturer and a professor, but qualify it with &#x27;senior lecturer&#x27; or &#x27;reader&#x27; in the title, for example: Associate Professor (Senior Lecturer).

==North American usage==
In the United States, Canada, and other countries influenced by their educational systems, the term is used differently, sometimes denoting academics without tenure who teach full or part-time but have few or no research responsibilities within the institution where they teach. Conversely, some universities use the term to refer to full-time, tenured faculty whose primary responsibilities are teaching and service instead of research. A convention some schools have begun to use is the title &quot;teaching professor,&quot; with or without ranks, to clarify that these are in fact true faculty members who simply do not have research obligations.
Senior lecturers sometimes have substantial experience and accomplishments in their field and possess a doctorate or its professional equivalent and sometimes just require a given number of years of experience. Also, in some schools it is a temporary post for visiting academics of considerable prominence—e.g. a famous writer may serve for a term or a year, for instance. In some colleges the term Senior Lecturer is awarded to highly qualified or accomplished lecturers.

==Singapore usage==
The National University of Singapore introduced a teaching-only career pathway in 2008, which was reframed as an educator-track rank in 2015. Senior lecturer is equivalent to the level of senior assistant professor. The next rank is associate professor (educator track).

==Comparison==

The table presents a broad overview of the traditional main systems, but there are universities which use a combination of those systems or other titles. Some universities in Commonwealth countries have also entirely adopted the North American system in place of the Commonwealth system.

<doc id="418380" wikidata="Q7173767" url="?curid=418380" title="Peter Duncan (actor)">
<text>Peter Duncan (born 3 May 1954) is an English actor and television presenter. He was a presenter of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; in the 1980s, and made a series of family travel documentaries between 1999 and 2005. He directed, produced and performed in &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; which received a national cinema release in the UK in 2020. In 2009, Peter Duncan co-founded The Natural Adventure, an adventure company specialising in self-guided walking and cycling holidays, with more than 600 tours in 58 countries. 

==Early life and education==

Duncan was born in London.

He was a student at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts, an independent stage school in London. Duncan completed his secondary education at Hawes Down School for Boys at West Wickham, Bromley, London. He also studied with the Open University.

==Early career==
Duncan&#x27;s early career was as a stage actor, appearing as Jim Hawkins in &quot;Treasure Island&quot; followed by two years at Sir Laurence Olivier&#x27;s National Theatre. His notable television roles include work on &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;King Cinder&quot;, &quot;Play for Today&quot;, &quot;Warship&quot;, &quot;Oranges &amp; Lemons&quot;, and season 2 of &quot;Survivors&quot;. In films, he appeared as Francois in the sex comedy &quot;On the Game&quot; (1974), the guitarist Kevin in &quot;Stardust&quot; (1974), Kit Nubbles in &quot;Mister Quilp&quot; (1975), the luckless Richard in &quot;The Lifetaker&quot; (1976), and in a brief role in the film &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1980), with his character dying after a few minutes on screen. Duncan starred in an episode of the children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Storybook International&quot; as a young master in the tale of &#x27;Cap O Rushes&#x27;.

Duncan played leading roles in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;King Cinder&quot; as Kerry, and as Jimmy Carter in the 1977–1978 ITV children&#x27;s television series &quot;The Flockton Flyer&quot;.

==&quot;Blue Peter&quot;==
He joined &quot;Blue Peter&quot; in 1980, and shortly afterwards it was revealed in a tabloid newspaper that Duncan had appeared nude in the Michael Papas psychological thriller film &quot;The Lifetaker&quot;. The BBC denied that he was ever a porn star.

He ran in the first London Marathon in 1981 (in 3 hours and 10 minutes) and ran again in the 1991, 2001 and 2012 events. He was scheduled on 3 October 2021 to run for the final time.

Unusually, Duncan had two periods with &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, being on the team from 1980 to 1984, and again from 1985 to 1986. During his stay with the programme, he became associated with the kind of daredevil stunts previously popularised by John Noakes, and these continued in his own spin-off series, &quot;Duncan Dares&quot;. One of his most remembered such stunts occurred in 1980 when the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; crew put him out on a rope swing to clean the face of Clock Tower (Big Ben) without a safety harness, thus creating much trouble for the BBC. It is documented in Richard Marson&#x27;s book &quot;Blue Peter 50th Anniversary&quot;.

On 20 February 2007 Duncan was awarded the highest Blue Peter Award - The Gold Badge. This badge was awarded in his role as the Scout Association&#x27;s Chief Scout.

==Return to the stage==
After leaving &quot;Blue Peter&quot; permanently in 1986, Duncan returned to the stage, most notably in Mike Stott&#x27;s &quot;Funny Peculiar&quot; and in the musicals &quot;Barnum&quot;, &quot;Me and My Girl&quot; and &quot;The Card&quot; for which he was nominated for an Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical. In the 1990s he appeared in numerous pantomimes, some of which he also produced through his company Here&#x27;s One I Made Earlier, including &quot;Robin Hood&quot; at the Lewisham (now Broadway) Theatre in South East London. He wrote and directed the Oxford Playhouse pantomime from 2006 to 2013. 

He played Charlie Peace at Nottingham Playhouse in 2013 and Jack Firebrace in Birdsong in 2014 and 2015. He played Wilbur Turnblad in the touring production of Hairspray in 2015/16. He is currently playing the part of John Blondel in a two-man ghostly play &quot;When Darkness Falls&quot;, set in Guernsey.

==Family travel documentaries==
Between 1999 and 2005, Duncan filmed and produced three travelogue documentary series. Each series consisted of six episodes and featured his family embarking on backpacking trips around the world. The family also consists of Duncan&#x27;s wife Annie, and their four children: Lucy, Katie, Georgia and Arthur.

The first series, &quot;Travel Bug&quot;, charted a six-month tour of the world. Filmed in 1999 when the children were aged 7 to 13, the series was shown on children&#x27;s television on BBC1. The next series, &quot;Chinese Breakaway&quot;, charted the family&#x27;s two-month backpacking trip across China in 2002. The series was aired on Five and Sky Travel. In the third series, &quot;Arthur&#x27;s trip to India&quot; (also aired on Five), Duncan&#x27;s 13-year-old son was featured as the chief presenter. A one-off additional episode (&quot;Arthur&#x27;s trip to Jordan&quot;) followed his son to the heart of the Middle East.

==Scout Association==
Duncan was appointed as the Scout Association&#x27;s Chief Scout, for a five-year tenure from 5 September 2004 to July 2009.

==2007 onwards==
In 2007, Duncan took part in the Channel 4 series &quot;The Games&quot;. He has written and directed pantomimes for Oxford Playhouse and the Cheltenham Everyman. Until 2019, he produced the pantomime for the Lighthouse theatre in Dorset. In 2007, he played Macduff in &quot;Macbeth&quot; at Regents Park Theatre, London, and filmed a documentary about the Scouts climbing Everest. His one-man show &quot;Daft and Dangerous&quot; appeared in the 2009 Edinburgh fringe. Duncan featured in &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot; for the third time on 26 January 2019.

As a keen outdoor adventurer, Duncan co-founded The Natural Adventure in 2009, an adventure company specialising in self-guided walking and cycling holidays, with more than 600 tours in 58 countries. 

In 2014, Duncan competed in BBC1&#x27;s acrobatic and circus show &quot;Tumble&quot;, losing in the semi-final.

He is a Patron of British Youth Music Theatre.

In 2020, he wrote, produced and directed &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;, a British film which had a national cinema release.

<text>Närke, is a province in Central Sweden, which historically formed part of Svealand. The name of the province is partly derived from an old name for the people of the province, the &quot;Njarar&quot; (Njars) or &quot;Nerikjar&quot; (today &quot;Närkingar&quot;). The root &quot;nari&quot;, &quot;neri&quot; is cognate to English &quot;narrow&quot; and refers to the narrow inlets that characterized the geography, a tribe that is also mentioned in the lay of Völund (Weyland the Smith):

:&quot;When the Lord of the Njars, Nidud, heard
:That Völund sat in Wolfdale alone,
:He sent warriors forth: white their shield-bosses
:In the waning moon, and their mail glittered.&quot;

The next source for Närke appears in Heimskringla by Snorri Sturluson, where we learn that Nerike had a king named Olof the Sharp-sighted whose granddaughter married king Ingjald ill-ruler, the king of Sweden. King Ingjald kills King Sporsnjall of Nerike, proclaiming himself the ruler of all of Sweden. When Ingjald is killed by Ivar Vidfamne, Ingjald&#x27;s son Olof Trätälja settles in Närke with what remains of the House of Yngling and their loyal men. They are later chased away and have to settle in the wasteland of Värmland which they colonize.

A powerful man in Närke called Sigtryg received the Norwegian King Olaf the Holy 1028-1029 before Olaf&#x27;s departure for Russia and its ruler Yaroslav I the Wise:

:&quot;It is to be related of King Olaf&#x27;s journey, that he went first from Norway eastward through Eid forest to Vermaland, then to Vatnsby, and through the forests in which there are roads, until he came out in Nerike district. There dwelt a rich and powerful man in that part called Sigtryg, who had a son, Ivar, who afterwards became a distinguished person. Olaf stayed with Sigtryg all spring (A.D. 1029); and when summer came he made ready for a journey, procured a ship for himself, and without stopping went on to Russia to King Jarisleif and his queen Ingegerd&quot; 

According to local traditions Olaf baptized many locals and the well he used can be seen near Hallsberg in the parish of Hardemo.</text><links>

<text>The Latin Union is an international organization of nations that use Romance languages, whose activities have been suspended since 2012. Headquartered in Paris, France, it aims to protect, project, and promote the common cultural heritage of Latin peoples and unifying identities of the Romance, and Romance-influenced, world. It was created in 1954 in Madrid, Spain. It started to operate in 1983 and its membership rose from 12 to 36 states, including countries in North America, South America, Northern Europe, Southern Europe, Africa, and the Asia-Pacific region.

Due to financial difficulties, the Latin Union announced on 26 January 2012 the suspension of its activities, the dissolution of its Secretariat General (effective 31 July 2012), and the termination of employment for all the organization&#x27;s personnel.

==Membership==
According to the Latin Union&#x27;s website, membership was open to any nation that met the following criteria:

*Linguistic criteria:
**Latin-derived language as official language, used in education, and commonly used in the mass media or in daily life
*Linguistic/cultural criteria:
**Existence of significant literature in a Latin-derived language
**Press and publication in Latin-derived language
**Television with a strong proportion of the programming in a Latin-derived language
**Radio widely broadcast in a Latin-derived language
*Cultural criteria :
**Direct or indirect inheritance of the legacy of Ancient Rome, to which the state remains faithful and which it perpetuates mainly through the education of Latin
**Cultural education of Latin-derived foreign languages
**Exchange programmes with other Latin countries
**Societal organization, particularly in the legal plane, based on respect for fundamental liberties, the general principles of human rights and democracy, tolerance, and freedom of religion

==Official languages==
The official languages of the Latin Union were Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Catalan. Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese were used as working languages. All the texts of general diffusion were translated into these four languages, with some also going into Romanian and Catalan.

==Organization==
The Union was composed of three main bodies, namely, the Congress, the Executive Council, and the General Secretariat.

===Congress===
The Congress, which consisted of the representatives of all the Member States, met in ordinary assembly every two years. Its main functions were

* to adopt the budget,
* to define the general direction of the Union,
* to receive the new Member States formally, and
* to elect and appoint different Member States to be the Presidents, Vice-Presidents, and members of the sub-organisations of the Union.

A President and two Vice-Presidents were also elected by the Congress. Oleg Serebrian from the Republic of Moldova was the last President.

There were also two auxiliary bodies of the Congress, namely, the Commission of Adhesions and the Commission of Candidacies.

* The Commission of Adhesions was composed of 10 Member States and was responsible for promoting the adherence of all the Member States of the Union.
* The Commission of Candidacies was composed of 9 Member States and was responsible for examining the validity of the candidacies, taking account of the geographical and linguistic-cultural division.

===Executive Council===
The Executive Council was the executive branch of the Union. It consisted of 12 Member States, which were elected by the Congress every four years, and led by a President and two Vice-Presidents, which were also elected by the Congress.

There were also two auxiliary commissions subordinated to the Executive Council: 
* The Commission of Finance and Programmes
* The Commission of Statues

===General Secretariat===
The Latin Union was directed by a Secretary-General appointed every four years by the Congress. The Secretary was in charge of the execution of the programmes and implemented the decisions made by the Congress and the Executive Council in the matter of budget and general direction. Jose Luis Dicenta Ballester was at one time Secretary-General of the Union.

Subordinated to the Secretary-General, there were 4 directors:
* Director of Administration and Finance
* Director of Culture and Communication
* Director of Promotion and Education of the Languages
* Director of Terminology and Industry of the Language

===Finance===
The finance of the Union was mainly supported by obligatory contributions from the Member States. For some activities, the Union may have collaborated with other public or private institutions.

<doc id="418388" wikidata="Q216131" url="?curid=418388" title="Fredrikstad FK">
<text>Fredrikstad Fotballklubb (also known as Fredrikstad or FFK) is a Norwegian professional football club from the town of Fredrikstad. With nine league championships and twelve Norwegian Cup wins, FFK is one of the most successful clubs in Norwegian football. The club was founded in 1903 and currently play in Eliteserien from 2024 after promotion from Norwegian First Division in 2023.

After suffering relegation from the then 1st division in 1984, Fredrikstad spent 18 years outside the top flight, before returning to the top division in 2004 after two successive promotions.

Fredrikstad stadion was FFK&#x27;s home ground between 1914 and 2006. However, its facilities were outdated and the club moved to a new stadium on the other side of river Glomma. Their new ground is located in a former shipyard, incorporating parts of the old buildings in the two side stands.
FFK draw great support from their area and the official supporter club&#x27;s name is Plankehaugen. More than 100 coaches filled with fans followed FFK to the cup final of 2006. The club&#x27;s supporters include an Ultras section, Supras Fredrikstad. The club had for some years a casual mob, Brigade Rød-Hvit (Brigade Red - White) which was active in the hooligan scene in Norway.

== History ==

Fredrikstad Fotballklubb was founded on 7 April 1903. While football in many older clubs was an addition to other established forms of sport, such as skiing or athletics, FFK was the first club in Norway to focus uniquely on playing football, and as such may be labeled the first true football club in the country. A lack of opposition meant this was in fact the third attempt at establishing a football club in Fredrikstad (tradition has it that the second attempt died out when the only football landed on a freight train bound for Moss). Finding someone in the vicinity to play against was still a problem when FFK was founded.

It so happened that the Englishman H. W. Kenworthy, who lived in the neighboring town of Sarpsborg, wanted to practice his native country&#x27;s sport and traveled to Fredrikstad to take part in one of FFK&#x27;s training sessions. Upon his return to Sarpsborg, it was suggested that he arrange for a new club to be established. The idea was well received in Sarpsborg, and Sarpsborg F.C. was founded on 8 May 1903. The first match between the teams was played the following year in Sarpsborg in front of 600 spectators. FFK won the historical match 4–0. Sarpsborg and Fredrikstad went on to establish the first regional series and inspired the founding of many new clubs in the region in the years to come.

FFK didn&#x27;t have the red and white colors when the club was founded in 1903. In fact, they changed suits seven times from 1903 to 1927. The colors that they wear now come from Polish National team. When FFK asked Polish Football Association if they could use their colours, they received positive reply and even set of clothes in the colours as a gift.

FFK reached the Norwegian Cup final for the first time in 1932. The semifinal against Mjøndalen was played at home in front of a record 9,000 spectators, and FFK won the match 3–0. Fredrikstad met Ørn Horten in the final, winning 6–1, and were thus Norwegian Champions. This signaled the start of Fredrikstad&#x27;s first successful era, in which the club claimed four more cup titles before the start of World War II. FFK became the first club to win the new nationwide league, in 1937–38, and they won The Double the following season.

In the 1930s, the club also had an active bandy department.

During the German occupation no organized football took place, as a result of all athletes going on strike in support of the resistance. After the war football was more popular than ever, and Fredrikstad set another attendance record against Sarpsborg in the semifinal of the 1945 Norwegian Cup. There was, however, little success on the pitch. FFK reached three cup finals in four years but lost all of them. The break came in 1949 when FFK won its third league title.

The 1950s and 1960s were highly successful years for FFK. The club secured the league title six times – back to back in 1950–51 and 1951–52 – and finished in second place seven times. The Norwegian Cup was won four times. In 1957, a new milestone was achieved when FFK won their second double. As league champions in 1960, Fredrikstad entered the European Cup as the first team from Norway, sensationally defeating Ajax 4–3 at home and drawing 0–0 in Amsterdam, in the first round.

The town of Fredrikstad was in many ways an economic powerhouse in Norway in the previous century, first as a major supplier of machinery to the timber industry and then as a center of shipbuilding activities. At one point the shipyard in Fredrikstad was the largest in Scandinavia. It has been said that there was always an air of optimism surrounding the town and its inhabitants, and it was certainly reflected in FFK&#x27;s playful and relaxed style of football, which many regarded as the most entertaining in the country. The club&#x27;s first cup triumph in &#x27;32 even made Jørgen Juve, a legend in Norwegian football, state: &quot;This is how football is supposed to be played.&quot;

Perhaps it was because of this relaxed atmosphere that the club was so successful, and also why it eventually fell into decline. After years of glory, the club was becoming conservative, although they would not admit it themselves. Other clubs were increasingly turning to professionalism, while players from FFK still played football in addition to having normal jobs. Training regimes were becoming more rigorous than before, but in Fredrikstad, they felt that training more than twice a week would ruin the joy of playing football. There is also the sentiment that, in light of the club&#x27;s formidable history, newer generations of FFK players were given too much responsibility, folding to the pressure again and again whenever things were starting to look brighter.

Fredrikstad was to struggle throughout the 1970s. They reached the cup final in 1971 but lost to Rosenborg, who was by now firmly en route to becoming a giant in Norwegian football. In 1972, they were runners-up in the league to Viking FK only on goal difference, as both teams finished the season on 34 points. In 1973, for the first time in the club&#x27;s history, FFK was relegated. They immediately gained promotion via the playoffs and by 1975 were back in the highest division, where they stayed for two seasons before facing relegation yet again.

The elevator ride between divisions continued until 1984. The Norwegian Cup went to Fredrikstad that year, but it must have been a bittersweet success. The club was once again relegated, and this time they were unable to make it back to the top flight. In 1992, FFK was relegated to the third highest division, where they would languish until 2002.

Fredrikstad&#x27;s comeback from obscurity is largely attributed to the manager Knut Torbjørn Eggen, who introduced a degree of professionalism the club had previously lacked. During his tenure, from 2001 until the end of 2006, the son of Rosenborg&#x27;s successful former coach led the team to their first title in more than two decades. In 2002, they were promoted from the 2. divisjon to the 1. divisjon, and in 2003, their centenary year, Fredrikstad finished second, earning promotion to the top division. Although struggling to maintain their form through an entire season, Fredrikstad has managed to retain their spot three times, and in 2006 they won the Norwegian Cup for the eleventh time in their history. They came 2nd and won silver in the 2008 season, but were relegated after a poor season in 2009 to 1. division. They eventually got promoted back to Tippeligaen through playoffs in November 2010 by first beating Løv-Ham 2–0, then Hønefoss BK with a stunning 8–1 goal difference over two matches.

On 13 December 2011, the offices of the club were raided by Norwegian police in connection with the Raio Piiroja contract investigations

After their relegation from the Eliteserien in 2012, Fredrikstad spent time in the Obos-Ligaen (2012-2017, 2021-2023) and PostNord-ligaen (2018-2020) before earning promotion back to the Eliteserien in 2024 under new manager Mikkjal Thomassen.

== Colours and badge ==

In the early years of the club, Fredrikstad changed attire quite frequently. The first kit, for example, consisted of blue and white striped shirts and black shorts, but was changed after only two years, to white shirts and blue shorts. In 1910, a green and white kit was adopted ahead of the club&#x27;s first semifinal in the Norwegian Cup.

The seventh and final iteration of Fredrikstad&#x27;s kit was introduced after a match between Norway and Poland at Fredrikstad stadion, on 7 October 1926. Fredrikstad would request of the Polish Football Association that they use the Polish national colors for the Polish national team:

The club received from the Polish association the new kit on 17 March 1927, when it became the official colors of Fredrikstad. The kit has since changed little in appearance apart from the socks, which went from being red and white to purely white in 1997.

FFK&#x27;s badge, a green and white streamer with a football and the initials F.F. (the original abbreviation for Fredrikstad Fotballklubb was F.F.), has remained virtually unchanged since its introduction in 1909. When the Fredrikstad kit changed to white and red, the colors of the streamer changed as well.

== Stadium ==

The old Fredrikstad stadion was inaugurated in 1914 and was the first stadium in Norway with floodlighting. FFK&#x27;s record attendance was set in 1956 against Larvik Turn. 15,534 spectators showed up for this quarter-final match of the Norwegian Cup. The stadium&#x27;s last renovation occurred ahead of the 2004 season, putting the capacity at around 10,500.

A new home ground was built for the 2007 season at Fredrikstad Mekaniske Verksted (colloquially known as &quot;Værste&quot;), an old shipyard in the center of Fredrikstad. This was once the largest shipyard in Scandinavia, and the architecture of the stadium is such that two of the now defunct mechanical workshops, dating from as far back as 1870, are converted into stands at the sides. In addition, two separate stands are built at the ends of the pitch. The new stadium (with the same name, Fredrikstad stadion) has an all-seater capacity of 12,550.

<text>Robert Dean Stethem (November 17, 1961 – June 15, 1985) was a United States Navy Seabee diver who was murdered by Hezbollah members during the hijacking of the commercial airliner he was aboard, TWA Flight 847. At the time of his death, his Navy rating was Steelworker Second Class (SW2). He was posthumously promoted to Master Chief Constructionman (CUCM).

==Early life==
Stethem was born in Waterbury, Connecticut, but grew up in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and Waldorf, Maryland. He was one of four children. His father, Richard Stethem, retired from the Navy as a Senior Chief after 20 years, continuing to work for it as a civilian afterwards. His mother Patricia served with the Navy before raising her family, continuing to serve in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces afterwards. His brother, Chief Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Kenneth Stethem, was a Navy SEAL and brother Diver First Class Patrick Stethem served in Underwater Construction Team One for 10 years – the same unit in which Robert served. Stethem had one sister, Sheryl Sierralta.

He graduated from Thomas Stone High School in 1980, where he played defensive back on the varsity and junior varsity football teams. He also played Little League baseball.

Stethem joined the Navy soon after graduating, reporting for duty on May 4, 1981.

==Navy career==
In the Navy, Stethem was a Seabee Steelworker assigned to Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 62 in Gulfport, Mississippi. He served multiple tours on Diego Garcia and Guam. Later, Stethem became a 2nd Class Navy Diver and was assigned to the Navy&#x27;s Underwater Construction Team One in Little Creek, Virginia.

==TWA Flight 847==
On June 14, 1985, Stethem was returning from an assignment in Nea Makri, Greece, aboard TWA Flight 847 when it was hijacked by members of the Lebanese organization Hezbollah. The hijackers kept 39 people hostage for 17 days, demanding the release of 766 Lebanese and Palestinians held by Israel.

When their demands were not met, Stethem, as a member of the U.S. military, was beaten and tortured. Finally, the terrorists shot him in the temple and dumped his body onto the tarmac at the Beirut airport.

One of the hijackers, Mohammed Ali Hammadi, was arrested two years later in Frankfurt, Germany. He was tried and convicted of Stethem&#x27;s murder and sentenced to life in prison but was released in 2005 after serving 19 years. Three others, Imad Mugniyah, Hassan Izz-Al-Din, and Ali Atwa, were eventually indicted for their involvement in the incident. In 2002, they were added to the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list. On February 13, 2008, Mugniyah was killed in an explosion in Damascus, Syria. On September 19, 2019, Greek police arrested a 65-year-old Lebanese man who was accused of involvement in the hijacking. The man was arrested at Mykonos during a passport check for cruise ship passengers. He was aboard a cruise ship that had crossed Rhodes, Santorini and Mykonos. Mykonos was the last stop before returning to Turkey. He was later released after police determined it was a case of mistaken identity.

==Awards and decorations==


Stethem was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery, Section 59, Grave 430, near other American victims of international terrorism.

On August 24, 2010, in Yokosuka, Japan, aboard the ship named after him – the USS &quot;Stethem&quot; (DDG-63) – Stethem was made an honorary Master Chief Constructionman (CUCM) by order of the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy. His brother, Kenneth, accepted the certificate and decorations on behalf of the Stethem family.

On April 24, 2015, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus presented the Prisoner of War medal to Stethem&#x27;s parents.

==Honors==

The following are named after Stethem:
* The Robert D. Stethem Memorial Sports Complex, Waldorf, Maryland
* The Robert D. Stethem Educational Center, a vocational school in Pomfret, Maryland
* Robert D. Stethem Barracks, Training Support Center Hampton Roads, Virginia Beach, Virginia

* Headquarters building and a street on the base, Port Hueneme Naval Construction Training Center, near Oxnard, California
* USS &quot;Stethem&quot; (DDG-63), an Aegis Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, commissioned 1995

==In popular culture==

A scene from the movie &quot;The Delta Force&quot; shows a U.S. Navy diver being beaten, tortured, murdered and his body being dumped onto the tarmac. This scene is based on Stethem.

<doc id="418396" wikidata="Q842501" url="?curid=418396" title="Dodo, Prince Yu">
<text>Dodo (; 2 April 1614 – 29 April 1649), formally known as [[Prince Yu (豫)|Prince Yu]], was a Manchu prince and military general of the early Qing dynasty.

==Family background==
Dodo was born in the Manchu Aisin Gioro clan as the 15th son of Nurhaci, the founder of the Later Jin dynasty. His mother was Nurhaci&#x27;s primary spouse Lady Abahai, who also bore Dodo&#x27;s full brothers Ajige and Dorgon.

==Career==
===Hong Taiji&#x27;s reign===

In 1620, Dodo was conferred the title of an &quot;ejen&quot;. He became a &quot;beile&quot; at the age of 13 and was put in charge of the Plain White Banner, and started administrating affairs in the Ministry of Rites and Ministry of War. In 1628, Dodo followed Hong Taiji on the conquest of Chahar, Mongolia, and was granted the title of &quot;eerkechuhuer&quot; (額爾克楚虎爾) for his achievements. The following year, he followed Hong Taiji again on the conquest of the Ming dynasty, crossing the Great Wall and closing in on the Ming capital Beijing.

In 1631, Dodo was involved in besieging the Ming army at Dalinghe. He lost his footing and fell from his horse during a battle and almost died at Jinzhou. The following year he participated in a campaign against Ligdan Khan of Chahar. In 1635 he was appointed commander-in-chief for the first time at the Battle of Dalinghe.

In 1636, Dodo was promoted to &quot;qinwang&quot; under the title &quot;Prince Yu of the First Rank&quot;. He followed Hong Taiji on the campaign against the Joseon dynasty of Korea and defeated the enemy at Mount Nanhan. Two years later, he was demoted two grades to &quot;beile&quot; for bringing prostitutes with him in his army. In 1641, Dodo participated in the Battle of Songjin and led the Qing army in besieging Jinzhou in the first part of the battle. He led an ambush to wipe out the remnants of the enemy at Mount Song in the final battle and joined Hooge&#x27;s forces in besieging Mount Song and captured the Ming general Hong Chengchou. He was promoted one grade to &quot;junwang&quot; for his achievement.

===Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s reign===
In 1644, Dodo entered Ming territory after the Ming general Wu Sangui opened Shanhai Pass for the Qing armies. They defeated rebel forces under Li Zicheng at Shanhai Pass and occupied the Ming capital Beijing, after which Dodo was reinstated as a &quot;qinwang&quot; and appointed &quot;Great General Who Pacifies the Nation&quot; (定國大將軍). Together with Kong Youde and Geng Zhongming, Dodo led an army of 200,000, comprising both Manchu and Han Chinese soldiers, to attack the remnants of Li Zicheng&#x27;s rebel army, defeating and driving the enemy from Henan to Shaanxi.

In the first month of 1645, Dodo conquered Tong Pass and Xi&#x27;an, and in the second month he attacked the Southern Ming dynasty (remnants of the fallen Ming dynasty). In the fourth month, Dodo captured the city of Yangzhou and executed its defending official Shi Kefa, after which he ordered the Yangzhou massacre. By the following month, Dodo&#x27;s army had crossed the Yangtze River and occupied the Southern Ming capital Nanjing and captured the Southern Ming ruler, the Hongguang Emperor. In the sixth month, Dodo conquered Zhejiang and returned to Beijing, after which he received the title &quot;Prince Deyu of the First Rank&quot; (和碩德豫親王).

Dodo berated and attacked the Southern Ming Hongguang Emperor (Prince of Fu, Zhu Yousong) over his battle strategy in 1645, telling him that the Southern Ming would have defeated the Qing if only the southern Ming assaulted the Qing military before they forded the Yellow river instead of tarrying. The Prince of Fu could find no words to respond when he tried to defend himself.

In 1646, Dodo was appointed &quot;Great General Who Spreads Might&quot; (揚威大將軍) and emerged victorious from suppressing a rebellion by the Sonid Mongols. A year later, he was conferred the title &quot;Uncle Who Assists in Governance and Prince Deyu of the First Rank&quot; (輔政叔和碩德豫親王).

==Death==
Dodo died of smallpox in 1649 at the age of 36. Dodo was said to have a very close relationship with his brother Dorgon. Dorgon was attacking Jiang Xiang (姜瓖) in Shanxi when he heard that Dodo was severely ill, so he immediately turned and rushed back to Beijing, but when he arrived at Juyong Pass, he received news that Dodo had died. Dorgon was so grieved that he changed into plain robes and cried as he raced back to Beijing.

==Posthumous demotion and restoration==
In 1652, the Shunzhi Emperor posthumously demoted Dodo to the status of a &quot;junwang&quot; for his affiliation with Dorgon, whom the emperor perceived to have had the intention of usurping the throne. In 1671, during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor, Dodo was granted a posthumous name &quot;Tong&quot; (通), so his title became &quot;Prince Yutong of the Second Rank&quot; (多羅豫通郡王). In the first lunar month of 1778, the Qianlong Emperor posthumously restored Dodo to the status of a &quot;qinwang&quot; and created a place for Dodo in the Qing ancestral temple. Seven months later, a shrine was built for Dodo in the Mukden Palace.

<doc id="418403" wikidata="Q1134348" url="?curid=418403" title="Volumetric flow rate">
<text>In physics and engineering, in particular fluid dynamics, the volumetric flow rate (also known as volume flow rate, or volume velocity) is the volume of fluid which passes per unit time; usually it is represented by the symbol (sometimes formula_1). It contrasts with mass flow rate, which is the other main type of fluid flow rate. In most contexts a mention of &quot;rate of fluid flow&quot; is likely to refer to the volumetric rate. In hydrometry, the volumetric flow rate is known as &quot;discharge&quot;. 

Volumetric flow rate should not be confused with volumetric flux, as defined by Darcy&#x27;s law and represented by the symbol , with units of m3/(m2·s), that is, m·s−1. The integration of a flux over an area gives the volumetric flow rate.
The SI unit is cubic metres per second (m3/s). Another unit used is standard cubic centimetres per minute (SCCM). In US customary units and imperial units, volumetric flow rate is often expressed as cubic feet per second (ft3/s) or gallons per minute (either US or imperial definitions). In oceanography, the sverdrup (symbol: Sv, not to be confused with the sievert) is a non-SI metric unit of flow, with equal to ; it is equivalent to the SI derived unit cubic hectometer per second (symbol: hm3/s or hm3⋅s−1). Named after Harald Sverdrup, it is used almost exclusively in oceanography to measure the volumetric rate of transport of ocean currents.

==Fundamental definition==
Volumetric flow rate is defined by the limit

: formula_2

that is, the flow of volume of fluid through a surface per unit time .

Since this is only the time derivative of volume, a scalar quantity, the volumetric flow rate is also a scalar quantity. The change in volume is the amount that flows &quot;after&quot; crossing the boundary for some time duration, not simply the initial amount of volume at the boundary minus the final amount at the boundary, since the change in volume flowing through the area would be zero for steady flow.

IUPAC prefers the notation formula_3 and formula_4 for volumetric flow and mass flow respectively, to distinguish from the notation formula_5 for heat.

==Alternative definition==
Volumetric flow rate can also be defined by
: formula_6
where
: = flow velocity,
: = cross-sectional vector area/surface.

The above equation is only true for uniform or homogeneous flow velocity and a flat or planar cross section. In general, including spatially variable or non-homogeneous flow velocity and curved surfaces, the equation becomes a surface integral:
: formula_7

This is the definition used in practice. The area required to calculate the volumetric flow rate is real or imaginary, flat or curved, either as a cross-sectional area or a surface. The vector area is a combination of the magnitude of the area through which the volume passes through, , and a unit vector normal to the area, formula_8. The relation is formula_9.

===Derivation===
The reason for the dot product is as follows. The only volume flowing &quot;through&quot; the cross-section is the amount normal to the area, that is, parallel to the unit normal. This amount is
: formula_10

where is the angle between the unit normal formula_8 and the velocity vector of the substance elements. The amount passing through the cross-section is reduced by the factor . As increases less volume passes through. Substance which passes tangential to the area, that is perpendicular to the unit normal, does not pass through the area. This occurs when and so this amount of the volumetric flow rate is zero:
: formula_12

These results are equivalent to the dot product between velocity and the normal direction to the area.

==Relationship with mass flow rate==
When the mass flow rate is known, and the density can be assumed constant, this is an easy way to get formula_5:
: formula_14
where
: = mass flow rate (in kg/s),
: = density (in kg/m3).

==Related quantities==
In internal combustion engines, the time area integral is considered over the range of valve opening. The time lift integral is given by

: formula_15

where is the time per revolution, is the distance from the camshaft centreline to the cam tip, is the radius of the camshaft (that is, is the maximum lift), is the angle where opening begins, and is where the valve closes (seconds, mm, radians). This has to be factored by the width (circumference) of the valve throat. The answer is usually related to the cylinder&#x27;s swept volume.

<text>Laurette Séjourné (L&#x27;Aquila, October 24, 1914 – Mexico City, May 25, 2003) was a Mexican archeologist and ethnologist best known for her study of the civilizations of Teotihuacan and the Aztecs and her theories concerning the Mesoamerican culture hero, Quetzalcoatl.

Laurette Séjourné was born in L&#x27;Aquila, Italy, as Laura Valentini Corsa, although one also finds her mentioned as Laura Bianchi. Little is known about her early years; even her precise birth date is rarely mentioned. In her prime youth, she appears to have moved to France, perhaps in connection with the fascist take-over of 1922; in later life, she still wrote in French. She married a Frenchman, Séjourné, and participated in cultural life and the world of the cinema, meeting such figures as André Breton and Jean Cocteau. Strongly politicized like many others at the times, she divorced her husband, and became the partner of Viktor Kibalchich or Kibaltchitch (1890-1947), a Russian novelist and revolutionary also known as Victor Serge. She left occupied France in 1942 to join him in exile in Mexico. There, she became a naturalized Mexican citizen and married him. Soon after his death, she joined the Mexican Communist Party. Later, she remarried with Arnaldo Orfila, director of the Fondo de Cultura Económica and founder of Siglo XXI Editores.

Séjourné&#x27;s militant spirit can be captured from a passage like the following one:
Later, her focus came to rest more and more on what to her was the embodiment of this Prehispanic &#x27;utopia&#x27;, Quetzalcoatl.

During the 1950s, Séjourné worked for Mexico&#x27;s National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). She did anthropological fieldwork in Oaxaca, but then changed to the field of archaeology, excavating at the pre-Spanish metropolis of Teotihuacan, which she believed was the legendary Tollan. She published several beautifully illustrated books on the art and architecture of Teotihuacan. Although she was the first to recognize the discontinuity between Teotihuacan and the much later Aztec civilization, her archaeological work has been subject to criticism.

To a wider public she became known through her 1957 publication on the cosmology and religion of the Toltecs and Aztecs, translated into English as &quot;Burning Water: Thought and Religion in Ancient Mexico&quot;. The book&#x27;s main focus is the figure of Tollan&#x27;s priestly king, Quetzalcoatl, and his teachings. Five years later, there was a follow-up in &quot;Quetzalcoatls&#x27; Universe&quot; (El Universo de Quetzalcoatl, 1962). Perhaps influenced by the ideas of Carl Jung, or by the historian of religion, Mircea Eliade, with whom Séjourné maintained a correspondence, these books sketch a rather spiritualized image of king Quetzalcoatl and his legendary reign, referring to &#x27;laws of interior preparation&#x27; supposedly left by the Toltec king and to advances &#x27;along the road to spirituality&#x27; made possible by these.

Laurette Séjourné&#x27;s final years were dedicated to bringing education to the Indian peoples of the south of Mexico. Her work is still valued by specialists.

<text>The Object Windows Library (OWL) is a C++ object-oriented application framework designed to simplify desktop application development for Windows and (some releases) OS/2.

OWL was introduced by Borland in 1991 and eventually deprecated in 1997 in favor of their Visual Component Library (VCL). Its primary competitor was the Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC). OWLNext, an open-source project driven by the OWL user community, has continued the maintenance of OWL, ensuring that the library and applications that use it work with the latest version of Windows and modern C++ compilers.

== History ==

In the early 1990s, Borland dominated the C++ market. In 1991, Borland introduced Borland C++ 3.0 which included OWL 1.0. At that time, C++ was just beginning to replace C for development of commercial software, driven by the rising of the Windows platform and the rapid adoption of object-oriented design. During this period, OWL was a popular choice for Windows application development.

In 1992, Microsoft introduced MFC as part of Microsoft C++ 7.0. As a similar C++ application framework for Windows, MFC immediately became OWL&#x27;s primary competitor in the C++ application development market.

OWL 1.0 depended on &quot;Dynamic Dispatch Virtual Tables&quot; (DDVT), a proprietary extension to C++ that allowed the programmer to bind Windows messages (events) to functions (event handlers) in a simple manner and with little run-time overhead. MFC, on the other hand, used a solution that did not require a language extension.

In 1993, Borland launched Borland C++ 4.0 which included OWL 2.0. In this version of OWL, the proprietary DDVT extension was replaced by &quot;response tables&quot;, a macro-based solution compatible with standard C++ and similar to MFC in use. A conversion tool (OWLCVT) was included to migrate code from OWL 1.0 to OWL 2.0.

In April 1993, Borland and Novell signed an agreement to port OWL to Novell AppWare Foundation. AppWare Foundation was an API designed by Novell to be cross-platform, allowing the deployment of applications on Mac, Windows and Unix clients and with several network services. The main tools for developing in AppWare were OWL and AppBuilder. However, in late 1994, Novell CEO Raymond Noorda resigned. Novell expansion plans were reconsidered, AppWare development was stopped and so was OWL for AppWare. In 1995 a group of original team members bought AppBuilder. In the same year, Software UNO offered a commercial port for OWL 2.0 to several platforms: AIX 3.2.5, DEC OSF/1 AXP, HP-UX 9.03, Linux 1.2, Solaris 2.x, Sun OS 4.1.x, and SVR4 for x86. It was called WM_MOTIF.

In 1995, Borland C++ 4.5 with OWL 2.5 was released. As it was released before Windows 95, Borland promised a free upgrade for any incompatibility present in the final Windows version. In August 1995, Microsoft launched Windows 95 and Visual Studio 4.0. By then, Visual Studio had already eclipsed Borland C++ in shipments, and it was clear that OWL was losing ground to MFC.

In 1996, Borland released Borland C++ 5 for Windows. This version included OWL 5, a major revamp of the library. While OWL 5 received a minor update with the release of Borland C++ 5.02 a little later, version 5 would end up as the final version of OWL by Borland.

In 1997, Borland released C++Builder and deprecated Borland C++. OWL was included on the &quot;Companion CD&quot; that shipped with C++Builder, but Borland ended maintenance and further development of the library.

In late 1999, Borland stopped selling Borland C++ and OWL.

== OWLNext ==

Shortly after Borland ended the development of OWL, maintenance was taken over by a group of users led by Yura Bidus. This effort evolved into the OWLNext open-source project currently hosted at the SourceForge site. OWLNext is a modern update and extension of OWL with support for the latest Windows versions and modern C++ compilers from Microsoft and Embarcadero Technologies.

== Shipped releases ==

Later versions of OWLNext have been released through SourceForge.

<doc id="418418" wikidata="Q458763" url="?curid=418418" title="IWI Tavor">
<text>The IWI Tavor, previously designated as the Tavor TAR-21 (Tavor Assault Rifle – 21st century), is an Israeli bullpup assault rifle chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO, designed and produced by Israel Weapon Industries (IWI). It is part of the Tavor family of rifles, which have spawned many derivatives of the original design.

The Tavor TAR-21 can also be mounted with the M203 grenade launcher, designated as the GTAR-21. A compact variant with a barrel is also available, designated as the CTAR-21. A designated marksman rifle variant with a folding under-barrel bipod and Trijicon ACOG 4× magnification sight was also made but later phased out in favour for the Tavor TAR Flattop.

Built around a long-stroke piston system (as found in the M1 Garand and AK-47), the Tavor is designed to maximise reliability, durability, simplicity of design, and ease of maintenance, particularly under adverse battlefield conditions.

In 2009, the Tavor X95 (also known as the Micro Tavor or MTAR) was selected by the Israel Defense Forces to gradually replace the M16 assault rifle and M4 carbine variants as the standard-issued weapon of the Israeli infantry by the end of 2018. The first X95 bullpup rifles were issued to infantry units in 2013. A report published on the IDF&#x27;s website revealed the IDF plans to continue acquiring the Micro Tavor and equipping combat units with it.

==History==

Israel Military Industries (the small arms branch of IMI was privatized into Israel Weapon Industries) initiated the Tavor development team in 1995, under the direction of gun designer Zalmen Shebs.

The objective of the project was to create an assault rifle that was more reliable, durable, and easier to maintain than the M4A1 carbine, while also being better suited to close-quarters combat and mechanized infantry roles. As a result, they hoped that the weapon would be officially adopted by the Israel Defense Forces.

Due to the military&#x27;s close-quarters and mechanized infantry requirements, the project team selected a bullpup design that would allow the weapon to be compact while keeping a long barrel able to achieve ballistically favourable high muzzle velocities. A long-stroke piston system, similar to that found in the AK-47 and M1 Garand, was selected to ensure the weapon&#x27;s reliability under adverse conditions.

===Trials and service===
The Tavor prevailed over the M4A1 in a series of trials conducted during 2001 and 2002 by the Israel Defense Force. Qualities tested included Mean Rounds Between Failures (MRBF), reliability, ergonomics during long marches, and ease-of-maintenance.

As part of initial testing by Israel Defense Forces&#x27; infantry units, the TAR-21 was distributed to members of the training company of the Tzabar Battalion from the Givati Brigade who were drafted in August 2001. They received their rifles in November 2001 during basic training. Initial testing results were favourable – the TAR-21 was found to be significantly more accurate and reliable (as well as more comfortable) than the M4 during extensive field testing.

Issues with fine sand entering the Tavor TAR&#x27;s chamber, which were identified over the two years of testing, were rectified by numerous small adjustments. A number of other improvements and changes to the design were also made between 2001 and 2009.

The Tavor CTAR-21 saw combat service in Operation Cast Lead, used by Givati Brigade and Golani Brigade, and the soldiers reported the Tavor bullpup assault rifles functioned flawlessly.

In November 2009, the IDF announced that the Tavor X95 would become the standard infantry weapon of the IDF, with the addition of an integrated grenade launcher. A gradual changeover has begun in 2006 and expected completion among front line troops was to be by the end of 2018.

In December 2012, the IDF announced that they would begin equipping and training their new reserve forces with the Tavor TAR-21.

The first Tavor X95s were issued to new recruits of a main IDF infantry brigade in 2013, replacing the M16. In 2014 the IDF announced that in the future (from as early as the end of 2014) some infantry units could start to be issued some numbers of an improved X95, which will have a longer barrel (instead of the original 33 cm barrel) and a lighter trigger pull.

On 8 September, the &quot;IsraelDefense&quot; website reported that the IDF plans to continue acquiring the Micro Tavor, quoting from a report posted on the IDF&#x27;s Hebrew website on 7 September regarding a multi-year plan. The rifle is to be distributed to combat troops of relevant units in upcoming rounds of recruitment. The weapons division of the Ground Forces Command was quoted as saying that it&#x27;s &quot;very satisfied by its capabilities... the rifle performs very well and has proven itself.&quot;

==Design details==
The Tavor is a bullpup assault rifle, capable of both semi-automatic fire and fully automatic fire. Due to its bullpup design the receiver, bolt carrier group, and magazine are placed behind the pistol grip. This shortens the firearm&#x27;s overall length without sacrificing barrel length. As a result, the Tavor provides carbine overall length, yet can achieve rifle muzzle velocities if equipped with a rifle-length barrel.

===Long-stroke piston system===
The Tavor uses a non-lubricated long-stroke piston system, as found in the M1 Garand, IMI Galil, and the AK-47. Like in the AK-47, the long-stroke piston mechanism contributes to the extreme forcefulness of the TAR-21&#x27;s extraction and chambering. The Tavor&#x27;s attachment of the piston to a heavy bolt carrier, and the extension of the mainspring into the hollow stem of the bolt carrier, bears a familiar resemblance to the internal mechanism of the AK-47.

===Ambidexterity and modularity===
The Tavor has ejection ports on both sides of the rifle so it can easily be reconfigured for right or left-handed shooters. However, this process requires partial disassembly, so it cannot be quickly reconfigured while the rifle is in use. An issue related to this is the original plastic cover on the unused ejection can allow gas to escape during the course of fire. Due to the bullpup design, this vents right under the shooter&#x27;s face, causing issues such as inhaling ejection gases and the fouling of glasses and face with ejection debris. The issue is exacerbated when the weapon is suppressed. This has been addressed by various non-factory solutions which increase sealing of the unused port.

Its ambidextrous fire mode selector above the pistol grip has a semi-automatic mode and a fully automatic mode. The Tavor features a self-contained, drop-in trigger group so that the trigger group can be changed or replaced without the use of additional tools.

===Chambering, cartridges and ammunition feeding===

The Tavor is primarily chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO and uses STANAG magazines, conversion kits for 9×19mm Parabellum and 5.45×39mm calibre are also available.

The IDF uses both M193 and M855 5.56×45mm rounds. M193 rounds are used by regular infantrymen for better terminal effects at shorter distances, while the heavier M855 is used by sharpshooters.

===Last round bolt-open catch===
The Tavor features a last round bolt catch, whereby the bolt holds open after the last round discharges. This is a request of modern armies, as it helps to allow soldiers to know when their magazine empties and to reduce reloading times during combat while also not requiring manual action cycling after.

===Barrel===
The Tavor barrels are made from CrMoV steel and cold-hammer-forged (CHF) on the premises of the IWI factory in Ramat HaSharon. The TAR-21 barrel is 18 inches (457 mm) in length and is chrome-lined for durability and corrosion resistance. The barrel features 6 grooves in a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist, or 32 calibres right hand twist rate.

The barrel is fitted with a &#x27;birdcage&#x27; style flash suppressor, which can be fully disassembled without the need for additional tools.

===Reliability, ease-of-maintenance and waterproofing===
The design objectives of the Tavor aimed for reliability and ease-of-maintenance, particularly under adverse or battlefield conditions. According to Russell C. Tilstra, the Tavor is &quot;easily considered more reliable&quot; than the M16 and M4 series rifles.

The Tavor is designed to be easily field-stripped, without the need for any additional tools.

It is waterproofed and its internal mechanism is sealed from outside elements, so that it can pass over-the-beach requirements.

==Variants==

IWI produces the Tavor TAR-21 in different variations as outlined below.

===TAR-21===
The Tavor TAR-21 is the standard variant with a 457 mm (18 in) long barrel.

====GTAR-21====
The GTAR-21 has a notched barrel, to accept an M203 grenade launcher, or a licensed variant thereof, chambered in 40x46mm.

====CTAR-21====
The CTAR-21 is a compact shorter 380 mm (15 in) barrel variant intended for commandos and special forces, but has become more favoured than the standard TAR-21 throughout the IDF.

====STAR-21====
The STAR-21 is a designated marksman variant with folding under-barrel bipod and Trijicon ACOG 4× magnification sight

=== Tavor X95 ===
The X95 (previously known as the MTAR-21) is the variant of the Tavor that was selected as the future standard infantry weapon of the IDF in 2009. In 2013, the X95 was issued for the first time as the standard infantry weapon to recruits of the Givati Brigade.

With the use of a conversion kit, the X95 can be converted from a 5.56 mm assault rifle to a 9 mm submachine gun. A suppressor can also be added to the weapon, as part of the 9 mm conversion kit. A grenade launcher can also be attached to the X95.

=== Tavor 7 ===
The IWI Tavor 7 is derived from the Tavor TAR. Essentially a battle rifle, chambered in 7.62×51 mm NATO. It is fully ambidextrous, features a 432 mm (17 in) barrel with a 730 mm (28.7 in) overall length. and a 508 mm (20 in) barrel with an 806 mm (31.7 in) overall length.

===Zittara===
An Indian-made version of the TAR, which was not adopted and it was made with a few prototypes from Ordnance Factory Board. Based on the Micro Tavor, it would be chambered in 5.56×30mm MINSAS, 5.56 NATO and 9x19mm.

===Ukrainian licensed Tavors===
Ukraine purchased a license for Tavors to be manufactured by Ukrainian firearm manufacturer RPC Fort. As of March 2021, Fort is no longer marketing them.

* Fort-221 – Ukrainian locally produced version of the CTAR-21 in 5.45×39 mm.
* Fort-222 – Ukrainian locally produced version of the STAR-21 in 5.45×39 mm.

===TC-21===
The semi-automatic Tavor Carbine (TC-21) was first made available for civilian customers to purchase in from 2008. The Canadian civilian version initially shipped with the Mepro reflex sight and a slightly longer barrel to meet the Canadian requirement for non-restricted semi-automatic centrefire rifles to have a barrel length of at least 470 mm. Current versions are shipped with a full-length Picatinny rail, without optics. In Europe, the Czech company Zeleny Sport recently (December 2015) imported Israeli-made TC-21s, equipped with Mepro M5 or M21 reflex sight, which are now available for both civilian and law enforcement customers.

In 2013, IWI started a US subsidiary, IWI US, which is manufacturing the semi-automatic TC-21 as the Tavor SAR for U.S. sales. The weapon is manufactured with a combination of Israeli and US parts. IWI US had shipped 50,000 Tavor SARs to US civilian customers by early 2016.

IWI US sells the Tavor SAR in variety of variants:

* TSB16: Semi-automatic version of the CTAR-21, with a  in (664 mm) overall length.
* TSB16L: A TSB16 with left-handed controls pre-installed.
* TSB16-BLK: A TSB16 chambered in .300 AAC Blackout.
* TSB17-9: 9×19 mm submachine gun with a 17 in (432 mm) barrel and a  in (664 mm) overall length.
* TSB18: 5.56×45 mm rifle with an 18 in (457 mm) barrel and a  in (702 mm) overall length.
* TSB18RS: 5.56×45 mm rifle with an 18 in (457 mm) barrel and a 30 in (762 mm) overall length; integrated permanent  in muzzle brake and a 10-round magazine to be compliant with laws of certain states. (&quot;RS&quot; stands for Restricted State.)
* TSIDF16: Semi-automatic version of the CTAR-21 without a full-length rail, an integrated MEPRO 21 sight, and a  in (664 mm) overall length; meant to be a semi-automatic replica of the CTAR-21 issued to the IDF.
Note: IWI US sells their Tavor SARs in a variety of colours, including Black (B), Flat Dark Earth (FD), and OD Green (G); the letter &quot;B&quot; subsequent to &quot;TS&quot; in the rifles&#x27; designations can be switched with any of the colours&#x27; respective letters.

====Aftermarket parts====
A significant aftermarket of spare and replacement parts has developed around the Tavor rifle family, including the development of match grade accurizing triggers for the bullpup rifle that are produced by manufacturers such as Geissele Automatics and double stage trigger pack TAV-D from Shooting Sight.

Shlomi Sabag, Deputy CEO of IWI, says that one of the indicators of the success of the rifle in the shooting sports or civilian market is the fact that &quot;an aftermarket of products associated with the Tavor bullpup rifle, like triggers, has evolved very quickly&quot;.

==Awards==
&quot;American Rifleman&quot; magazine awarded the Tavor SAR the 2014 Golden Bullseye Award as its Rifle of the Year.

&quot;Shooting Illustrated&quot; magazine named the Tavor X95 as its 2017 Rifle of the Year.

* : Hamas&#x27; Al-Qassam Brigades captured stockpiles of Tavor rifles in the 7 October attack on Israel.
*: The Honduran Army operates the Tavor X95.
* : In late 2002, India signed an deal with Israel Military Industries for 3,070 manufactured TAR-21s to be issued to India&#x27;s special forces personnel, where its ergonomics, reliability in heat and sand might give them an edge at close quarters and deployment from inside vehicles. By 2005, IMI had supplied 350–400 TAR-21s to India&#x27;s northern Special Frontier Force (SFF). These were subsequently declared to be &quot;operationally unsatisfactory&quot;. The required changes were made and tests in Israel during 2006 went well, clearing the contracted consignment for delivery. The new GTAR-21s came with a modified single-piece stock, new sights and Turkish-made MKEK T-40 under-barrel grenade launchers chambered in 40x46mm. In 2011 the rifles were handed over to Para SF divisions. A consignment of over 500 Tavor TAR-21s and another 30 Galil sniper rifles worth over and respectively was delivered to the MARCOS (Marine Commandos) in December 2010. In 2016, IWI announced that it was establishing a 49:51 joint venture with Punj Lloyd in India, in order to manufacture rifle components in India.

* : Used by Rapid Deployment Unit (Tar-21) and Special Anti-terrorist Unit – Tiger (Tavor x95) .
* : Small quantities in use by special units of the Philippine Marines and Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency and one PNP SWAT team in Pasig.
* : Small quantities of the TAR-21 are in use by field and intervention units of the &quot;Polícia Judiciária&quot;, like hostage negotiation teams and investigators who usually work alongside other dedicated law enforcement intervention units—the Special Operations Group (GOE) and the National Republican Guard&#x27;s Special Operations Company (COE); these weapons were initially intended to equip a new unit under the command of the &quot;Polícia Judiciária&quot; resembling the GOE. The TAR-21 also participated in the competition for the new service rifle for the three branches of the Portuguese Armed Forces and the Police Special Operations Group (GOE)—a bid that also included the local production of the TAR-21 in Portugal. However, the TAR-21 was excluded from the shortlist. The competition has meanwhile been annulled, after the other contenders and both political and defence critics accused the competition of favouring the Heckler &amp; Koch G36.

* : Yuriy Lutsenko, then head of Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, announced on October 1, 2008 that IWI and Ukrainian state-owned company RPC Fort would jointly manufacture Tavor TAR to enter service with special Ukrainian military and police units. RPC Fort had displayed working samples of Tavor TARs chambered in 5.45×39mm cartridge with Milkor 40mm UBGL grenade launchers to showcase to Ukrainian security forces officers as a means of convincing them to buy Ukrainian-made Tavor TARs for special forces units. In December 2009, a resolution was adopted to purchase the Fort 221 chambered in 5.45x39 for Ukrainian intelligence/border guard agencies, purchased in small numbers. It was subsequently adopted in 2014 for Ukrainian military and police forces. Known users include Ukrainian Spetsnaz forces and the Scorpion unit. The tavor has been used in the Russia - Ukraine war. Note that further survey of Fort’s website shows that the Tavor series of rifles ceased to be listed on the page in March 2021 and IWI and Meprolight were removed from the site’s ‘Partners’ section in April 2021. Perhaps suggesting the end of the IWI-Fort partnership.
* : In August 2013, IWI US announced that the Pennsylvania Capitol Police had adopted the Tavor SAR, a variant specifically designed for the U.S. market. In July 2014, it was announced that the Lakewood, New Jersey Police Department would begin to adopt the Tavor SAR, after the weapon &quot;met the demands and requirements of the Lakewood PD for reliability, ease-of-maintenance, durability and accuracy&quot;. The Hidalgo County Sheriff&#x27;s Office in Texas, operate Tavor SAR.

<text>Petunia Pig is an animated cartoon character in the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of cartoons from Warner Bros. She looks much like her significant other, Porky Pig, except that she wears a dress and has pigtailed black hair.

==Biography==
Petunia was introduced by animator Frank Tashlin in the 1937 short &quot;Porky&#x27;s Romance&quot;. The film is arguably a parody of &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Nightmare&quot;, a 1932 Walt Disney cartoon; whereas Mickey Mouse dreams of a marriage made difficult by dozens of annoying kids, Porky&#x27;s nightmare-marriage also involves a scornful Petunia treating him badly. Tashlin adopted Petunia as a regular member of Porky&#x27;s entourage and featured her in two more cartoons: &quot;The Case of the Stuttering Pig&quot; and &quot;Porky&#x27;s Double Trouble&quot;, both in 1937.

Bob Clampett was the only other Warner director to utilize Petunia after Tashlin left the studio in 1938. He first featured her in &quot;Porky&#x27;s Picnic&quot;, a 1939 film that sees Porky tormented by his nephew Pinkie. Pinkie and Porky&#x27;s encounters are always out of sight of Petunia, of course, so she blames Porky for everything that goes wrong as a result of Pinkie&#x27;s activity. Petunia&#x27;s largest role came in Clampett&#x27;s 1939 short &quot;Naughty Neighbors&quot;. The film borrows elements from both the famous feud between the Hatfields and McCoys as well as &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; as Porky and Petunia&#x27;s love for each other is stymied by their respective hillbilly families&#x27; mutual hatred.

By the early 1940s, Porky&#x27;s popularity had been eclipsed by the brasher characters of Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny. Porky was relegated to a supporting player or straight man to Daffy in most of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; shorts of this era. Petunia, already a bit player to Porky&#x27;s lead, fared much worse; her tenure as a major Warner Bros. character was effectively over.

Although Petunia made only a handful of appearances in Warner Bros. cartoons, she continued to appear frequently in Warner&#x27;s merchandising, with a major presence in comic books for the entire 1941–1984 run of Western Publishing (Dell, Gold Key and Whitman Comics) &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; comics, &quot;Porky Pig&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny&quot; and various other titles. Often featured in Porky&#x27;s stories, she sometimes co-starred with Bugs Bunny and occasionally had a story of her own. Pinkie, renamed &quot;Cicero&quot; for the comic books, was depicted as being Petunia&#x27;s young cousin as well as Porky&#x27;s nephew. Petunia was portrayed in the comics as a determined, bossy, and occasionally pretentious character, similar to the early Tashlin depiction, though with a genuine affection towards Porky. In early years, she was often rivals with Bugs, who enjoyed pranking and humbling her.

==Later appearances==
Nevertheless, in modern years Petunia has appeared in multiple new roles:

* Petunia has a co-starring role in Filmation&#x27;s lone &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;-related production, &quot;Daffy Duck and Porky Pig Meet the Groovie Goolies&quot;, in 1972. She is voiced by Jay Scheimer, the wife of Filmation co-founder Lou Scheimer.
* Petunia made a cameo appearance in the 1979 short &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; as Mrs. Cratchit, wife of Bob Cratchit (played by Porky Pig), though she had no speaking lines.
* Petunia was intended to appear as a cameo with Porky in the film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; in the deleted scene &quot;Acme&#x27;s Funeral&quot;.

<doc id="418434" wikidata="Q1095058" url="?curid=418434" title="Romanian alphabet">
<text>The Romanian alphabet is a variant of the Latin alphabet used for writing the Romanian language. It consists of 31 letters, five of which (Ă, Â, Î, Ș, and Ț) have been modified from their Latin originals for the phonetic requirements of the language.

The letters Q (&quot;chiu&quot;), W (&quot;dublu ve&quot;), and Y (&quot;igrec&quot; or &quot;i grec,&quot; meaning &quot;Greek i&quot;) were formally introduced in the Romanian alphabet in 1982, although they had been used earlier. They occur only in foreign words and their Romanian derivatives, such as &quot;quasar&quot;, &quot;watt&quot;, and &quot;yoga&quot;. The letter &quot;K&quot;, although relatively older, is also rarely used and appears only in proper names and international neologisms such as &quot;kilogram&quot;, &quot;broker&quot;, &quot;karate&quot;. These four letters are still perceived as foreign, which explains their usage for stylistic purposes in words such as &quot;nomenklatură&quot; (normally &quot;nomenclatură&quot;, meaning &quot;nomenclature&quot;, but sometimes spelled with &quot;k&quot; instead of &quot;c&quot; if referring to members of the Communist leadership in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc countries, as &quot;nomenklatura&quot; is used in English).

Most of the &lt;qu&gt; and &lt;y&gt; in learned Latin words (or Greek words via Latin) are replaced by &lt;cu/cv&gt; and respectively (e.g. &quot;ecuație&quot; &quot;equation&quot;, &quot;acvariu&quot; &quot;aquarium&quot;, &quot;oxigen&quot; &quot;oxygen&quot;). However, the &lt;y&gt; is retained in ytriu (&quot;yttrium&quot;) and yterbiu (&quot;ytterbium&quot;), probably because of the element symbols Y and Yb.

In cases where the word is a direct borrowing having diacritical marks not present in the above alphabet, official spelling tends to favor their use (&quot;München&quot;, &quot;Angoulême&quot; etc., as opposed to the use of &quot;Istanbul&quot; over &quot;İstanbul&quot;).

==Letters and their pronunciation ==
Romanian spelling is mostly phonemic without &quot;silent letters&quot; (but see &quot;i&quot;). The table below gives the correspondence between letters and sounds. Some of the letters have several possible readings, even if allophones are not taken into account. When vowels , , , and are changed into their corresponding semivowels, this is not marked in writing. Letters K, Q, W, and Y appear only in foreign borrowings; the pronunciation of W and Y and of the combination QU depends on the origin of the word they appear in.

* See Comma-below (ș and ț) versus cedilla (ş and ţ).

==Special letters==
Romanian orthography does not use accents or diacritics – these are secondary symbols added to letters (i.e. basic glyphs) to alter their pronunciation or to distinguish between words. There are, however, five special letters in the Romanian alphabet (associated with four different sounds) which are formed by modifying other Latin letters; strictly speaking these letters function as basic glyphs in their own right rather than letters with diacritical marks, but they are often referred to as the latter.

* Ă ă — &quot;a&quot; with breve – for the sound 
* Â â — &quot;a&quot; with circumflex – for the sound 
* Î î — &quot;i&quot; with circumflex – for the sound 
* Ș ș — &quot;s&quot; with comma – for the sound 
* Ț ț — &quot;t&quot; with comma – for the sound 

The letter &quot;â&quot; is used exclusively in the middle of words; its majuscule version appears only in all-capitals inscriptions.

Writing letters ș and ț with a cedilla instead of a comma is considered incorrect by the Romanian Academy. Romanian writings, including books created to teach children to write, treat the comma and cedilla as a variation in font. See Unicode and HTML below.

=== Î versus Â ===
The letters &quot;î&quot; and &quot;â&quot; are phonetically and functionally identical. The reason for using both of them is historical, denoting the language&#x27;s Latin origin.

For a few decades until a spelling reform in 1904, as many as four or five letters had been used for the same phoneme (&quot;â&quot;, &quot;ê&quot;, &quot;î&quot;, &quot;û&quot;, and occasionally &quot;ô&quot;, see Removed Letters), according to an etymological rule. All were used to represent the vowel , toward which the original Latin vowels written with circumflexes had converged. The 1904 reform saw only two letters remaining, &quot;â&quot; and &quot;î&quot;, the choice of which followed rules that changed several times during the 20th century.

During the first half of the century the rule was to use &quot;î&quot; in word-initial and word-final positions, and &quot;â&quot; everywhere else. There were exceptions, imposing the use of &quot;î&quot; in internal positions when words were combined or derived with prefixes or suffixes. For example, the adjective &quot;ugly&quot; was written with &quot;î&quot; because it derives from the verb &quot;to hate&quot;.

In 1953, during the Communist era, the Romanian Academy eliminated the letter &quot;â&quot;, replacing it with &quot;î&quot; everywhere, including the name of the country, which was to be spelled . The first stipulation coincided with the official designation of the country as a People&#x27;s Republic, which meant that its full title was . A minor spelling reform in 1964 brought back the letter &quot;â&quot;, but only in the spelling of &quot;Romanian&quot; and all its derivatives, including the name of the country. As such, the Socialist Republic proclaimed in 1965 is associated with the spelling .

Soon after the fall of the Ceaușescu government, the Romanian Academy decided to reintroduce &quot;â&quot; from 1993 onward, by canceling the effects of the 1953 spelling reform and essentially reverting to the 1904 rules (with some differences). The move was publicly justified as the rectification either of a Communist assault on tradition, or of a Soviet influence on the Romanian culture, and as a return to a traditional spelling that bears the mark of the language&#x27;s Latin origin. The political context at the time, however, was that the Romanian Academy was largely regarded as a Communist and corrupt institution — Nicolae Ceaușescu and his wife Elena had been its honored members, and membership had been controlled by the Communist Party. As such, the 1993 spelling reform was seen as an attempt of the Academy to break with its Communist past. The Academy invited the national community of linguists as well as foreign linguists specialized in Romanian to discuss the problem; when these overwhelmingly opposed the spelling reform in vehement terms, their position was explicitly dismissed as being too scientific.

According to the 1993 reform, the choice between &quot;î&quot; and &quot;â&quot; is thus again based on a rule that is neither strictly etymological nor phonological, but positional and morphological. The sound is always spelled as &quot;â&quot;, except at the beginning and the end of words, where &quot;î&quot; is to be used instead. Exceptions include proper nouns where the usage of the letters is frozen, whichever it may be, and compound words, whose components are each separately subjected to the rule (e.g. + → &quot;clumsy&quot;, not *). However, the exception no longer applies to words derived with suffixes, in contrast with the 1904 norm; for instance what was spelled after 1904 became after 1993.

Although the reform was promoted as a means to show the Latin origin of Romanian, statistically only few of the words written with &quot;â&quot; according to the 1993 reform actually derive from Latin words having an &quot;a&quot; in the corresponding position. In fact, this includes a large number of words that contained an &quot;i&quot; in the original Latin and are similarly written with &quot;i&quot; in their Italian or Spanish counterparts. Examples include &quot;river&quot;, from the Latin (compare Spanish ), now written ; along with &lt; , &lt; , &lt; , &lt; , etc.

While the 1993 spelling norm is compulsory in Romanian education and official publications, and gradually most other publications came to use it, there are still individuals, publications and publishing houses preferring the previous spelling norm or a mixed hybrid system of their own; among them are the weekly cultural magazine and the daily . Some publications allow authors to choose either spelling norm; these include , the magazine of the Writers&#x27; Union of Romania, and publishing houses such as . Dictionaries, grammars and other linguistic works have also been published using the and long after the 1993 reform.

Ultimately, the conflict results from two different linguistically-based reasonings as to how to spell . The choice of &quot;â&quot; derives from &quot;a&quot; being the most average or central of the five vowels (the official Bulgarian romanization uses the same logic, choosing &quot;a&quot; for ъ, resulting in the country&#x27;s name being spelled &quot;Balgariya&quot;; and also the European Portuguese vowel for &quot;a&quot; mentioned above), whereas &quot;î&quot; is an attempt to choose the Latin letter that most intuitively writes the sound (similarly to how Polish uses the letter &quot;y&quot;).

=== Comma-below (ș and ț) versus cedilla (ş and ţ) ===

Although the Romanian Academy standard mandates the comma-below variants for the sounds and , the cedilla variants are still widely used. Many printed and online texts still incorrectly use &quot;s with cedilla&quot; and &quot;t with cedilla&quot;. This state of affairs is due to an initial lack of glyph standardization, compounded by the lack of computer font support for the comma-below variants (see the Unicode section for details).

The lack of support for the comma diacritics has been corrected in current versions of major operating systems: Windows Vista or newer, Linux distributions after 2005 and currently supported macOS versions. As mandated by the European Union, Microsoft released a font update to correct this deficiency in Windows XP (also applicable to 2000/Server 2003) in early 2007, soon after Romania joined the European Union.

=== Obsolete letters ===
Before the spelling reform of 1904, there were several additional letters with diacritical marks.
* Vowels:
** ĭ — &quot;i&quot; with breve indicated semivowel &quot;i&quot; as part of Romanian diphthongs and triphthongs &quot;ia&quot;, &quot;ei&quot;, &quot;iei&quot; etc., or a final, &quot;whispered&quot; sound of the preceding palatalized consonant, in words such as &quot;&quot; (), &quot;lupi&quot; ( – &quot;wolves&quot;), and &quot;greci&quot; ( – &quot;Greeks&quot;) — &quot;Bucurescĭ&quot; (the proper spelling at the time used &quot;c&quot; instead of &quot;t&quot;, &quot;see &quot;), &quot;lupĭ&quot;, &quot;grecĭ&quot;, like the Slavonic soft sign. The Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet kept the Cyrillic equivalents of this letter, namely й and ь, but it was abolished in the Romanian Latin alphabet for unknown reasons. By replacing this letter with a simple &quot;i&quot; without making any additional changes, the phonetic value of the letter &quot;i&quot; became ambiguous; even native speakers can sometimes mispronounce words such as the toponym &quot;Pecica&quot; (which has two syllables, but is often mistakenly pronounced with three) or the name &quot;Mavrogheni&quot; (which has four syllables, not three). Additionally, in a number of words such as &quot;subiect&quot; &quot;subject&quot; and &quot;ziar&quot; &quot;newspaper&quot;, the pronunciation of &quot;i&quot; as a vowel or as a semivowel is different among speakers.
** ŭ — &quot;u&quot; with breve was used only in the ending of a word. It was essentially a Latin equivalent of the Slavonic back yer found in languages like Russian. Unpronounced in most cases, it served to indicate that the previous consonant was not palatalized, or that the preceding &quot;i&quot; was the vowel and not a mere marker of palatalization. When &quot;ŭ&quot; was pronounced, it would follow a stressed vowel and stand in for semivowel &quot;u&quot;, as in words &quot;eŭ&quot;, &quot;aŭ&quot;, and &quot;meŭ&quot;, all spelled today without the breve. Once frequent, it survives today in author Mateiu Caragiale&#x27;s name – originally spelled &quot;Mateiŭ&quot; (it is not specified whether the pronunciation should adopt a version that he himself probably never used, while in many editions he is still credited as &quot;Matei&quot;). In other names, only the breve was dropped, while preserving the pronunciation of a semivowel &quot;u&quot;, as is the case of B.P. Hasdeŭ.
** ĕ — &quot;e&quot; with breve. This letter is now replaced with &quot;ă&quot;. The existence of two letters for one sound, the schwa, had an etymological purpose, showing from which vowel (&quot;a&quot; or &quot;e&quot;) it originally derived. For example &quot;împĕrat&quot; – &quot;emperor&quot; (&lt;Imperator), &quot;vĕd&quot; – &quot;I see&quot; (&lt;vedo), &quot;umĕr&quot; – &quot;shoulder&quot; (&lt;humerus), &quot;păsĕri&quot; – &quot;birds&quot; (&lt; cf. passer).
** é / É — Latin small/capital letter &quot;e&quot; with acute accent indicated a sound that corresponds either to today&#x27;s Romanian diphthong &quot;ea&quot;, or in some words, to today&#x27;s Romanian letter &quot;e&quot;. It would originally indicate the sound of Romanian letter &quot;e&quot; when it was pronounced as diphthong &quot;ea&quot; in certain Romanian regions, e.g. &quot;acéste&quot; (today spelled &quot;aceste&quot;) and &quot;céle&quot; (today spelled &quot;cele&quot;). This letter would sometimes indicate a derived word from a Romanian root word containing Latin letter &quot;e&quot;, as is the case of &quot;mirésă&quot; (today spelled &quot;mireasă&quot;) derived from &quot;mire&quot;. For other words it would underlie a relationship between a Romanian word and a Latin word containing letter &quot;e&quot;, where the Romanian word would use &quot;é&quot;, such as &quot;gréle&quot; (today spelled &quot;grele&quot;) derived from Latin word . Lastly, this letter was used to accommodate the sound that corresponds to today&#x27;s Romanian diphthong &quot;ia&quot;, as in the word &quot;ér&quot; (&quot;iar&quot; today).
** ó / Ó — Latin small/capital letter &quot;o&quot; with acute accent indicated a sound that corresponds to today&#x27;s Romanian diphthong &quot;oa&quot;. This letter would sometimes indicate a derived word from a Romanian root word containing Latin letter &quot;o&quot;, as is the case of &quot;popóre&quot; (today spelled &quot;popoare&quot;) derived from &quot;popor&quot;. For other words it would underlie a relationship between a Romanian word and a Latin word containing letter &quot;o&quot;, where the Romanian word would use &quot;ó&quot;, such as &quot;fórte&quot; (today spelled &quot;foarte&quot;) derived from Latin word , as well as in &quot;fóme&quot; (&quot;foame&quot; today).
** ê, û and ô — see Î vs Â
* Consonants
** d̦ / D̦ — Latin small/capital letter &quot;d&quot; with comma below was used to indicate the sound that corresponds today to Romanian letter &quot;z&quot;. It would denote that the word it belonged to derived from Latin and that its corresponding Latin letter was &quot;d&quot;. Examples of words containing this letter are: &quot;d̦ece&quot; (&quot;ten&quot;), &quot;d̦i&quot; (&quot;day&quot;) – reflecting its derivation from the Latin word , &quot;Dumned̦eu&quot; (&quot;God&quot;) – reflecting the Latin phrase Domine Deus, &quot;d̦ână&quot; (&quot;fairy&quot;) – to be derived from the Latin word Diana. In today&#x27;s Romanian language this letter is no longer present and Latin letter &quot;z&quot; is used in its stead. 

In addition, the acute accent (á, í) was used in verb infinitives and 3rd-person imperfect forms stressed on the last syllable: &quot;lăudá&quot; (&quot;to praise&quot;), &quot;aud̦í&quot; (&quot;to hear&quot;), 3rd-person imperfect &quot;lăudá&quot;, &quot;aud̦iá&quot;. The grave accent (à, ì, ù) was used in 3rd-person perfect forms stressed on the last syllable: &quot;lăudà&quot;, &quot;aud̦ì&quot;.

Use of these letters was not fully adopted even before 1904, as some publications (e.g. &quot;Timpul&quot; and &quot;Universul&quot;) chose to use a simplified approach that resembled today&#x27;s Romanian language writing.

=== Other diacritics ===

As with other languages, the acute accent is sometimes used in Romanian texts to indicate the stressed vowel in some words. This use is regular in dictionary headwords, but also occasionally found in carefully edited texts to disambiguate between homographs that are not also homophones, such as to differentiate between &quot;cópii&quot; (&quot;copies&quot;) and &quot;copíi&quot; (&quot;children&quot;), &quot;éra&quot; (&quot;the era&quot;) and &quot;erá&quot; (&quot;was&quot;), &quot;ácele&quot; (&quot;the needles&quot;) and &quot;acéle&quot; (&quot;those&quot;), etc. The accent also distinguishes between homographic verb forms, such as &quot;încúie&quot; and &quot;încuié&quot; (&quot;he locks&quot; and &quot;he has locked&quot;).

Diacritics in some borrowings are kept: &quot;bourrée&quot;, &quot;pietà&quot;. Foreign names are also usually spelled with their original diacritics: &quot;Bâle&quot;, &quot;Molière&quot;, even when an acute accent might be wrongly interpreted as a stress, as in &quot;István&quot; or &quot;Gérard&quot;. However, frequently used foreign names, such as names of cities or countries, are often spelled without diacritics: &quot;Bogota&quot;, &quot;Panama&quot;, &quot;Peru&quot;.

== Digital typography ==

=== ISO 8859 ===

The character encoding standard ISO 8859 initially defined a single code page for the entire Central and Eastern Europe — ISO 8859-2. This code page includes only &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot; with cedillas. The South-Eastern European ISO 8859-16 includes &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot; with comma below on the same places &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot; with cedilla were in ISO 8859-2. The ISO 8859-16 code page became a standard after Unicode became widespread, however, so it was largely ignored by software vendors.

=== Unicode and HTML ===

The circumflex and breve accented Romanian letters were part of the Unicode standard since its inception, as well as the cedilla variants of s and t. Ș and ț (comma-below variants) were added to Unicode version 3.0. From Unicode version 3.0 to version 5.1, the cedilla-using characters were specified by the Unicode Standard to be &quot;used in both Turkish and Romanian data&quot; and that &quot;a glyph variant with comma below is preferred for Romanian&quot;; On the newly encoded comma-using characters, it said that they should be used &quot;when distinct comma below form is required&quot;. Unicode 5.2 explicitly states that &quot;the form with the cedilla is preferred in Turkish, and the form with the comma below is preferred in Romanian&quot;, while mentioning (possibly for historical reasons) that &quot;in Turkish and Romanian, a cedilla and a comma below sometimes replace one another&quot;.

Widespread adoption was hampered for some years by the lack of fonts providing the new glyphs. In May 2007, four months after Romania (and Bulgaria) joined the EU, Microsoft released updated fonts that include all official glyphs of the Romanian (and Bulgarian) alphabet. This font update targeted Windows 2000, XP and Server 2003. The subset of Unicode most widely supported on Microsoft Windows systems, Windows Glyph List 4, still does not include the comma-below variants of S and T.
Vowels with diacritics are coded as follows:
==== Adobe/Linotype de facto standard ====

Adobe Systems decided that the Unicode glyphs &quot;t with cedilla&quot; U+0162/3 are not used in any language. (It is in fact used, but in very few languages. T with Cedilla exists as part of the General Alphabet of Cameroon Languages, in some Gagauz orthographies, in the Kabyle dialect of the Berber language, and possibly elsewhere.) Adobe has therefore substituted the glyphs with &quot;t with comma below&quot; (U+021A/B) in all the fonts they ship. The unfortunate consequence of this decision is that Romanian documents using the (unofficial) Unicode points U+015E/F and U+0162/3 (for ş and ţ) are rendered in Adobe fonts in a visually inconsistent way using &quot;s with cedilla&quot;, but &quot;t with comma&quot; (see figure). Linotype fonts that support Romanian glyphs mostly follow this convention.

The fonts used by Microsoft before Windows Vista also implement this de facto Adobe standard. Few Microsoft fonts provide a consistent look when cedilla variants are used; notable ones are Tahoma, Verdana, Trebuchet MS, Microsoft Sans Serif and Segoe UI.

The free DejaVu and Linux Libertine fonts provide proper and consistent glyphs in both variants. Red Hat&#x27;s Liberation fonts only support the comma below variants starting with version 1.04, scheduled for inclusion in Fedora 10.

==== OpenType codice_1 feature ====

Some OpenType fonts from Adobe and all C-series Vista fonts implement the optional OpenType feature codice_2. This feature forces &quot;s with cedilla&quot; to be rendered using the same glyph as &quot;s with comma below&quot;. When this second (but optional) remapping takes place, Romanian Unicode text is rendered with comma-below glyphs regardless of code point variants.

Unfortunately, most Microsoft pre-Vista OpenType fonts (Arial etc.) do not implement the codice_1 feature, even after the European Union Expansion Font Update, so old documents will look inconsistent as in the left side of the above figure. Select few fonts, e.g. Verdana and Trebuchet MS, not only have a consistent look for cedilla variants (after the EU update), but also do a simultaneous remapping of cedilla s and t to comma-below variants when codice_1 is activated. The free DejaVu and Linux Libertine fonts do not yet offer this feature in their current releases, but development versions do.

Pango supports the codice_5 tag since version 1.17. XeTeX supports codice_5 since version 0.995. As of July 2008, very few Windows applications support the codice_5 feature tag. From the Adobe CS3 suite, only InDesign has support for it.

The status of Romanian support in the free fonts that ship with Fedora is maintained at Fedoraproject.org.

==== Combining characters ====

Unicode also allows diacritical marks to be represented as separate combining diacritical marks. The relevant combining accents are U+0326 COMBINING COMMA BELOW and U+0327 COMBINING CEDILLA. Support for applying a combining Comma Below to letters S and T may have been poorly supported in commercial fonts in the past, but nearly all modern fonts can successfully handle both the Cedilla and Comma Below marks for S and T. As with all fonts, typographical quality can vary, and so it is preferable to use the single code points instead. Whenever a combining diacritical mark is used in a document, the font in use should be tested to confirm that it is rendered acceptably.

===(La)TeX===

LaTeX allows typesetting in Romanian using the cedilla Ş and Ţ using the Cork encoding. The comma-below variants are not completely supported in the standard 8-bit TeX font encodings. The lack of a standard LICR (LaTeX Internal Character Representations) for comma-below Ș and Ț is part of the problem. The codice_8 input method attempts to remedy the problem by defining the \textcommabelow LICR accent. This is unfortunately not supported by the codice_9 input method.

The problem may partially worked around in a LaTeX document using these settings, which would allow use of ș, ț or their cedilla variants directly in the LaTeX source:

The codice_8 package composes the comma-below glyphs by superimposing a comma and the letters S and T. This method is suitable only for printing. In PDF documents produced this way searching or copying text does not work properly. The Polish QX encoding has some support for comma-below glyphs, which are improperly mapped to cedilla LICRs, but also lacks A breve (Ă), which must always be composite, thus unsearchable.

In the Latin Modern Type 1 fonts the T with comma below is found under the AGL name /Tcommaaccent. This is in contradiction with Adobe&#x27;s decision discussed above, which puts a T with comma-below at /Tcedilla. In consequence, no fixed mapping can work across all Type 1 fonts; each font must come with its own mapping. Unfortunately, TeX output drivers, like dvips, dvipdfm or pdfTeX&#x27;s internal PDF driver, access the glyphs by AGL name. Since all of the output drivers mentioned are unaware of this peculiarity, the problem is essentially intractable across all fonts. In consequence, one needs to use fonts that include a mapping which is not bypassed by TeX. This is the case with newer TeX engine XeTeX, which can use Unicode OpenType fonts, and does not bypass the font&#x27;s Unicode map.

===Keyboard layout===
Modern computer operating systems can be configured to implement a standard Romanian keyboard layout, to permit typing on any keyboard as if it were a Romanian keyboard.

In systems such as Linux which employ the XCompose system, Romanian letters may be typed from a non-Romanian keyboard layout using a compose-key.
The system&#x27;s keyboard layout must be set up to use a compose-key. (Exactly how this is accomplished depends on the distribution.) For instance, the &#x27;left Alt&#x27; key is often used as a compose-key.

To type a letter with a diacritical mark, the compose-key is held down while another key is typed indicate the mark to be applied, then the base letter is typed. For instance, when using an English (US) keyboard layout, to produce ț, hold the compose-key down while typing semicolon &#x27;;&#x27;, then release the compose-key and type &#x27;t&#x27;. Other marks may be similarly applied as follows:

==Spelling alphabet==
There is a Romanian equivalent to the English-language spelling alphabets. Most of the code words are people&#x27;s first names, with the exception of K, J, Q, W and Y. Letters with diacritics (Ă, Â, Î, Ș, Ț) are generally transmitted without diacritics (A, A, I, S, T).

<text>Economic anthropology is a field that attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope. It is an amalgamation of economics and anthropology. It is practiced by anthropologists and has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical. Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology began with work by the Polish founder of anthropology Bronislaw Malinowski and the French Marcel Mauss on the nature of reciprocity as an alternative to market exchange. In an earlier German context, Heinrich Schurtz has been cited as a “founder of economic anthropology&quot; for his pioneering inquiries into money and exchange across different cultural settings.

Post-World War II, economic anthropology was highly influenced by the work of economic historian Karl Polanyi. Polanyi drew on anthropological studies to argue that true market exchange was limited to a restricted number of western, industrial societies. Applying formal economic theory (Formalism) to non-industrial societies was mistaken, he argued. In non-industrial societies, exchange was &quot;embedded&quot; in such non-market institutions as kinship, religion, and politics (an idea he borrowed from Mauss). He labelled this approach Substantivism. The formalist–substantivist debate was highly influential and defined an era.

As globalization became a reality, and the division between market and non-market economies – between &quot;the West and the Rest&quot; – became untenable, anthropologists began to look at the relationship between a variety of &quot;types&quot; of exchange within market societies. Neo-substantivists examine the ways in which so-called pure market exchange in market societies fails to fit market ideology. Economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists. They now study the operations of corporations, banks, and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective.

== Reciprocity and the gift ==

===Malinowski and Mauss: Debate over the Kula exchange===
Bronislaw Malinowski&#x27;s groundbreaking work, &quot;Argonauts of the Western Pacific&quot; (1922), posits the question, &quot;why would men risk life and limb to travel across huge expanses of dangerous ocean to give away what appear to be worthless trinkets?&quot; Carefully traced the network of exchanges of bracelets and necklaces across the Trobriand Islands, Malinowski established that they were part of a system of exchange, the Kula ring. He stated that this exchange system was clearly linked to political authority.

In the 1920s and later, Malinowski&#x27;s research became the subject of debate with the French anthropologist, Marcel Mauss, author of &quot;The Gift&quot; (&quot;Essai sur le don,&quot; 1925). Contrasting Mauss, Malinowski emphasised the exchange of goods between &quot;individuals&quot;, and their non-altruistic motives for giving: they expected a return of equal or greater value. In other words, reciprocity is an implicit part of gifting; no &quot;free gift&quot; is given without expectation of reciprocity.

Mauss, however, posited that the gifts were not merely between individuals, but between representatives of larger collectivities. These gifts were, he argued, a &quot;total prestation.&quot; They were not simple, alienable commodities to be bought and sold, but, like the Crown jewels, embodied the reputation, history, and identity of a &quot;corporate kin group&quot;. Given the stakes, Mauss asked, &quot;Why anyone would give them away?&quot; His answer was an enigmatic concept, &quot;hau&quot;, &quot;the spirit of the gift.&quot; Largely, the confusion (and resulting debate) was due to a bad translation. Mauss appeared to be arguing that a return gift is given to keep the very relationship between givers alive; a failure to return a gift ends the relationship and the promise of any future gifts. Based on an improved translation, Jonathan Parry has demonstrated that Mauss was arguing that the concept of a &quot;pure gift&quot; given altruistically only emerges in societies with a well-developed market ideology.

Mauss&#x27; concept of &quot;total prestations&quot; has been developed in the later 20th century by Annette Weiner, who revisited Malinowski&#x27;s fieldsite in the Trobriand Islands. Publishing in 1992, her critique was twofold: Weiner first noted that Trobriand Island society has a matrilineal kinship system. As a consequence, women hold a great deal of economic and political power, as inheritance is passed from mother to daughter through the female lines. Malinowski missed this insight in his 1922 work, ignoring women&#x27;s exchanges in his research. Secondly, Weiner further developed Mauss&#x27; argument about reciprocity and the &quot;spirit of the gift&quot; in terms of inalienable possessions: &quot;the paradox of keeping while giving.&quot; Weiner contrasted &quot;moveable goods,&quot; which can be exchanged, with &quot;immoveable goods,&quot; which serve to draw the gifts back. In the context of the Trobriand study, male Kula gifts were moveable gifts compared to those of women&#x27;s landed property. She argued that the specific goods given, such as Crown Jewels, are so identified with particular groups that, even when given they are not truly alienated. Not all societies, however, have these kinds of goods, which depend upon the existence of particular kinds of kinship groups. French anthropologist Maurice Godelier pushed the analysis further in &quot;The Enigma of the Gift&quot; (1999).

Albert Schrauwers has argued that the kinds of societies used as examples by Weiner and Godelier, such as the Kula ring in the Trobriands, the Potlatch of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, or the Toraja of South Sulawesi, Indonesia, are all characterized by ranked aristocratic kin groups that fit with Claude Lévi-Strauss&#x27; model of &quot;House Societies&quot; where &quot;House&quot; refers to both noble lineage and their landed estate. Total prestations are given, he argues, to preserve landed estates identified with particular kin groups and maintain their place in a ranked society. 
=== Gifts and commodities ===

The misunderstanding about what Mauss meant by &quot;the spirit of the gift&quot; led some anthropologists to contrast &quot;gift economies&quot; with &quot;market economies,&quot; presenting them as polar opposites and implying that non-market exchange was always altruistic. Marshall Sahlins, a well-known American cultural anthropologist, identified three main types of reciprocity in his book &quot;Stone Age Economics&quot; (1972). Gift or &quot;generalized reciprocity&quot; is the exchange of goods and services without keeping track of their exact value, but often with the expectation that their value will balance out over time. &quot;Balanced or Symmetrical reciprocity&quot; occurs when someone gives to someone else, expecting a fair and tangible return - at a specified amount, time, and place. Market or &quot;Negative reciprocity&quot; is the exchange of goods and services whereby each party intends to profit from the exchange, often at the expense of the other. Gift economies, or generalized reciprocity, occur within closely knit kin groups, and the more distant the exchange partner, the more imbalanced or negative the exchange becomes.

This opposition was classically expressed by Chris Gregory in his book &quot;Gifts and Commodities&quot; (1982). Gregory argued that
Commodity exchange is an exchange of alienable objects between people who are in a state of reciprocal independence that establishes a quantitative relationship between the objects exchanged… Gift exchange is an exchange of inalienable objects between people who are in a state of reciprocal dependence that establishes a qualitative relationship between the transactors&quot; (emphasis added.)

Other anthropologists, however, refused to see these different &quot;exchange spheres&quot; as polar opposites. Marilyn Strathern, writing on a similar area in Papua New Guinea, dismissed the utility of the opposition in &quot;The Gender of the Gift&quot; (1988).

===Spheres of exchange===

The relationship of new market exchange systems to indigenous non-market exchange remained a perplexing question for anthropologists. Paul Bohannan (see below, under substantivism) argued that the Tiv of Nigeria had three spheres of exchange, and that only certain kinds of goods could be exchanged in each sphere; each sphere had its own different form of money. Similarly, Clifford Geertz&#x27;s model of &quot;dual economy&quot; in Indonesia, and James C. Scott&#x27;s model of &quot;moral economy&quot; hypothesized different exchange spheres emerging in societies newly integrated into the market; both hypothesized a continuing culturally ordered &quot;traditional&quot; exchange sphere resistant to the market. Geertz used the sphere to explain peasant complacency in the face of exploitation, and Scott to explain peasant rebellion. This idea was taken up lastly by Jonathan Parry and Maurice Bloch, who argued in &quot;Money and the Morality of Exchange&quot; (1989) that the &quot;transactional order&quot; through which long-term social reproduction of the family takes place has to be preserved as separate from short-term market relations.

===Charity: &quot;the poison of the gift&quot;===

In his classic summation of the gift exchange debate, Jonathan Parry highlighted that ideologies of the &quot;pure gift&quot; (as opposed to total prestations) &quot;is most likely to arise in highly differentiated societies with an advanced division of labour and a significant commercial sector.&quot; Schrauwers illustrated the same points in two different areas in the context of the &quot;transition to capitalism debate&quot; (see &quot;Political Economy&quot;). He documented the transformations among the To Pamona of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, as they were incorporated in global market networks over the twentieth century. As their everyday production and consumption activities were increasingly commodified, they developed an oppositional gift (&quot;posintuwu&quot;) exchange system that funded social reproductive activities, thereby preserving larger kin, political and religious groups. This &quot;pure gift&quot; exchange network emerged from an earlier system of &quot;total prestations.&quot;

Similarly, in analyzing the same &quot;transition to capitalist debate&quot; in early 19th century North America, Schrauwers documented how new, oppositional &quot;moral economies&quot; grew in parallel with the emergence of the market economy. As the market became increasingly institutionalized, so too did early utopian socialist experiments such as the Children of Peace, in Sharon, Ontario, Canada. They built an ornate temple dedicated to sacralizing the giving of charity; this was eventually institutionalized as a mutual credit organization, land sharing, and co-operative marketing. In both cases, Schrauwers emphasizes that these alternate exchange spheres are tightly integrated and mutualistic with markets as commodities move in and out of each circuit. Parry had also underscored, using the example of charitable giving of alms in India (Dāna), that the &quot;pure gift&quot; of alms given with no expectation of return could be &quot;poisonous.&quot; That is, the gift of alms embodying the sins of the giver, when given to ritually pure priests, saddled these priests with impurities that they could not cleanse themselves of. &quot;Pure gifts&quot; given without a return, can place recipients in debt, and hence in dependent status: the poison of the gift. Although the Children of Peace tried to sacralize the pure giving of alms, they found charity created difficulties for recipients. It highlighted their near bankruptcy and hence opened them to lawsuits and indefinite imprisonment for debt. Rather than accept charity, the free gift, they opted for loans.

=== &#x27;The social life of things&#x27; and singularization ===
Rather than emphasize how particular kinds of objects are either gifts or commodities to be traded in restricted spheres of exchange, Arjun Appadurai and others began to look at how objects flowed between these spheres of exchange. They shifted attention away from the character of the human relationships formed through exchange, and placed it on &quot;the social life of things&quot; instead. They examined the strategies by which an object could be &quot;singularized&quot; (made unique, special, one-of-a-kind) and so withdrawn from the market. A marriage ceremony that transforms a purchased ring into an irreplaceable family heirloom is one example; the heirloom, in turn, makes a perfect gift.

Singularization is the reverse of the seemingly irresistible process of commodification. These scholars show how all economies are a constant flow of material objects that enter and leave specific exchange spheres. A similar approach is taken by Nicholas Thomas, who examines the same range of cultures and the anthropologists who write about them, and redirects attention to the &quot;entangled objects&quot; and their roles as both gifts and commodities. This emphasis on things has led to new explorations in &quot;consumption studies&quot; (see below).

== Cultural construction of economic systems: the substantivist approach ==

===Formalist vs substantivist debate===
The opposition between substantivist and formalist economic models was first proposed by Karl Polanyi in his work &quot;The Great Transformation&quot; (1944). He argued that the term &#x27;economics&#x27; has two meanings: the formal meaning refers to economics as the logic of rational action and decision-making, as rational choice between the alternative uses of limited (scarce) means. The second, substantive meaning, however, presupposes neither rational decision-making nor conditions of scarcity. It simply refers to the study of how humans make a living from their social and natural environment. A society&#x27;s livelihood strategy is seen as an adaptation to its environment and material conditions, a process which may or may not involve utility maximisation. The substantive meaning of &#x27;economics&#x27; is seen in the broader sense of &#x27;economising&#x27; or &#x27;provisioning&#x27;. Economics is simply the way members of society meet their material needs. Anthropologists embraced the substantivist position as empirically oriented, as it did not impose western cultural assumptions on other societies where they might not be warranted. The Formalist vs. Substantivist debate was not between anthropologists and economists, however, but a disciplinary debate largely confined to the journal &quot;Research in Economic Anthropology.&quot; In many ways, it reflects the common debates between &quot;etic&quot; and &quot;emic&quot; explanations as defined by Marvin Harris in cultural anthropology of the period. The principal proponents of the substantivist model were George Dalton and Paul Bohannan. Formalists such as Raymond Firth and Harold K. Schneider asserted that the neoclassical model of economics could be applied to any society if appropriate modifications are made, arguing that its principles have universal validity.

For some anthropologists, the substantivist position does not go far enough. Stephen Gudeman, for example, argues that the processes of making a livelihood are culturally constructed. Therefore, models of livelihoods and related economic concepts such as exchange, money or profit must be analyzed through the locals&#x27; ways of understanding them. Rather than devising universal models rooting in Western economic terminologies and then applying them indiscriminately to all societies, scholars must come to understand the &#x27;local model&#x27;.

===Stephen Gudeman and the culturalist approach===
In his work on livelihoods, Gudeman seeks to present the &quot;people&#x27;s own economic construction&quot; (1986:1); that is, people&#x27;s own conceptualizations or mental maps of economics and its various aspects. His description of a peasant community in Panama reveals that the locals did not engage in exchange with each other in order to make a profit but rather viewed it as an &quot;exchange of equivalents&quot;, with the exchange value of a good being defined by the expenses spent on producing it. Only outside merchants made profits in their dealings with the community; it was a complete mystery to the locals how they managed to do so.
Gudeman also criticizes the substantivist position for imposing their universal model of economics on preindustrial societies and so making the same mistake as the formalists. While conceding that substantivism rightly emphasises the significance of social institutions in economic processes, Gudeman considers any deductive universal model, be it formalist, substantivist or Marxist, to be ethnocentric and tautological. In his view they all model s as mechanistic processes by taking the logic of natural science based on the material world and applying it to the human world. Rather than to &quot;arrogate to themselves a privileged right to model the economies of their subjects&quot;, anthropologists should seek to understand and interpret local models (1986:38). Such local models may differ radically from their Western counterparts. For example, the Iban use only hand knives to harvest rice. Although the use of sickles could speed up the harvesting process, they believe that this may cause the spirit of the rice to flee, and their desire to prevent that outcome is greater than their desire to economize the harvesting process.

Gudeman brings post-modern cultural relativism to its logical conclusion. Generally speaking, however, culturalism can also be seen as an extension of the substantivist view, with a stronger emphasis on cultural constructivism, a more detailed account of local understandings and metaphors of economic concepts, and a greater focus on socio-cultural dynamics than the latter (cf. Hann, 2000). Culturalists tend to be both less taxonomic and more culturally relativistic in their descriptions while critically reflecting on the power relationship between the ethnographer (or &#x27;modeller&#x27;) and the subjects of his or her research. While substantivists generally focus on institutions as their unit of analysis, culturalists lean towards detailed and comprehensive analyses of particular local communities. Both views agree in rejecting the formalist assumption that all human behaviour can be explained in terms of rational decision-making and utility maximisation.

Culturalism can be criticized from various perspectives. Marxists argue that culturalists are too idealistic in their notion of the social construction of reality and too weak in their analysis of external (i.e. material) constraints on individuals that affect their livelihood choices. If, as Gudeman argues, local models cannot be held against a universal standard, then they cannot be related to hegemonic ideologies propagated by the powerful, which serve to neutralise resistance. This is further complicated by the fact that in an age of globalization most cultures are being integrated into the global capitalist system and are influenced to conform to Western ways of thinking and acting. Local and global discourses are mixing, and the distinctions between the two are beginning to blur. Even though people will retain aspects of their existing worldviews, universal models can be used to study the dynamics of their integration into the rest of the world.

===Householding===

===Entrepreneurs in &quot;imperfect markets&quot;===
Inspired by a collection on &quot;Trade and Market in the early Empires&quot; edited by Karl Polanyi, the substantivists conducted a wide comparative study of market behavior in traditional societies where such markets were embedded in kinship, religion and politics. They thus remained focused on the social and cultural processes that shaped markets, rather than on the individual focused study of economizing behavior found in economic analysis. George Dalton and Paul Bohannon, for example, published a collection on markets in sub-Saharan Africa. &quot;Pedlars and Princes: Social Development and Economic Change in Two Indonesian Towns&quot; by Clifford Geertz compared the entrepreneurial cultures of Islamic Java with Hinduized Bali in the post-colonial period. In Java, trade was in the hands of pious Muslims, whereas in Bali, larger enterprises were organized by aristocrats. Over time, this literature was refocused on &quot;informal economies&quot;, those market activities lying on the periphery of legal markets. Modernization theory of development had led economists in the 1950s and 1960s to expect that traditional forms of work and production would disappear in developing countries. Anthropologists found, however, that the sector had not only persisted, but expanded in new and unexpected ways. In accepting that these forms of productions were there to stay, scholars began using the term informal sector, which is credited to the British anthropologist Keith Hart in a study on Ghana in 1973. This literature focuses on the &quot;invisible work&quot; done by those who fall outside the formal production process, such as the production of clothing by domestic workers, or those who are bound labourers in sweatshops. As these studies have shifted to the informal sector of western economies, the field has been dominated by those taking a political economy approach.

===Neo-Substantivism and capitalism as a cultural system===
While many anthropologists like Gudeman were concerned with peasant economic behaviour, others turned to the analysis of market societies. Economic sociologist Mark Granovetter provided a new research paradigm (neo-substantivism) for these researchers. Granovetter argued that the neo-liberal view of economic action which separated economics from society and culture promoted an &#x27;undersocialized account&#x27; that atomises human behavior. Similarly, he argued, substantivists had an &quot;over-socialized&quot; view of economic actors, refusing to see the ways that rational choice could influence the ways they acted in traditional, &quot;embedded&quot; social roles. Neo-Substantivism overlaps with &#x27;old&#x27; and especially new institutional economics.

Granovetter applied the concept of embeddedness to market societies, demonstrating that even their, &quot;rational&quot; economic exchanges are influenced by pre-existing social ties. In his study of ethnic Chinese business networks in Indonesia, Granovetter found individual&#x27;s economic agency embedded in networks of strong personal relations. In processes of clientelization the cultivation of personal relationships between traders and customers assumes an equal or higher importance than the economic transactions involved. Economic exchanges are not carried out between strangers but rather by individuals involved in long-term continuing relationships.

== Money and finance ==
===Special and general purpose of money===
Early anthropologists of the substantivist school were struck by the number of &quot;special purpose monies,&quot; like wampum and shell money, that they encountered. These special purpose monies were used to facilitate trade, but were not the &quot;universal&quot; money of market-based economies. Universal money served five functions:
* Medium of exchange: they facilitated trade
* Unit of account: they are an abstract measure of value or worth
* Store of value: they allow wealth to be preserved over time
* Standard of deferred payment: they are a measure of debt
* Means of payment: they can be used in non-market situations to pay debts (like taxes).

Special purpose monies, in contrast, were frequently restricted in their use; they might be limited to a specific exchange sphere such as the brass rods used by the Tiv of Nigeria in the early twentieth century (see &quot;spheres of exchange&quot; above). Most of this early work documented the effects of universal money on these special purpose monies. Universal money frequently weakened the boundaries between exchange spheres. Others have pointed out, however, how alternative currencies such as Ithaca HOURS in New York state are used to create new community based spheres of exchange in western market economies by fostering barter.

Much of this work was updated and retheorized in the edited collection: &quot;Money and Modernity: State and Local Currencies in Melanesia&quot;. A second collection, &quot;Money and the morality of exchange&quot; examined how &quot;general purpose money&quot; could be transformed into a &quot;special purpose money&quot; - how money could be &quot;socialized&quot; and stripped of its moral danger so that it abets domestic economies free of market demands.

William Reddy undertook the same kind of analysis of the meanings of monetary exchange in terms of the growth of Liberalism in early modern Europe. Reddy critiques what he calls the &quot;Liberal illusion&quot; that developed in this period, that money is a universal equivalent and a principle of liberation. He underscores the different values and meanings that money has for those of different classes.

===Barter===
David Graeber argues that the inefficiencies of barter in archaic society has been used by economists since Adam Smith to explain the emergence of money, the economy, and hence the discipline of economics itself. &quot;Economists of the contemporary orthodoxy... propose an evolutionary development of economies which places barter, as a &#x27;natural&#x27; human characteristic, at the most primitive stage, to be superseded by monetary exchange as soon as people become aware of the latter&#x27;s greater efficiency.&quot; However, extensive investigation since then has established that &quot;No example of a barter economy, pure and simple, has ever been described, let alone the emergence from it of money; all available ethnography suggests that there never has been such a thing. But there are economies today which are nevertheless &quot;dominated&quot; by barter.&quot;

Anthropologists have argued &quot;that when something resembling barter &quot;does&quot; occur in stateless societies it is almost always between strangers, people who would otherwise be enemies.&quot; Barter occurred between strangers, not fellow villagers, and hence cannot be used to naturalistically explain the origin of money without the state. Since most people engaged in trade knew each other, exchange was fostered through the extension of credit. Marcel Mauss, author of &#x27;The Gift&#x27;, argued that the first economic contracts were to &quot;not&quot; act in one&#x27;s economic self-interest, and that before money, exchange was fostered through the processes of reciprocity and redistribution, not barter. Everyday exchange relations in such societies are characterized by generalized reciprocity, or a non-calculative familial &quot;communism&quot; where each takes according to their needs, and gives as they have.

Other anthropologists have questioned whether barter is typically between &quot;total&quot; strangers, a form of barter known as &quot;silent trade&quot;. However, Benjamin Orlove has shown that barter occurs through &quot;silent trade&quot; (between strangers), but also in commercial markets as well. &quot;Because barter is a difficult way of conducting trade, it will occur only where there are strong institutional constraints on the use of money or where the barter symbolically denotes a special social relationship and is used in well-defined conditions. To sum up, multipurpose money in markets is like lubrication for machines - necessary for the most efficient function, but not necessary for the existence of the market itself.&quot;

Barter may occur in commercial economies, usually during periods of monetary crisis. During such a crisis, currency may be in short supply, or highly devalued through hyperinflation. In such cases, money ceases to be the universal medium of exchange or standard of value. Money may be in such short supply that it becomes an item of barter itself rather than the means of exchange. Barter may also occur when people cannot afford to keep money (as when hyperinflation quickly devalues it).

=== Money as commodity fetish ===

Anthropologists have analyzed these cultural situations where universal money is being introduced as a means of revealing the underlying cultural assumptions about money that market based societies have internalized. Michael Taussig, for example, examined the reactions of peasant farmers in Colombia as they struggled to understand how money could make interest. Taussig highlights that we have fetishized money. We view money as an active agent, capable of doing things, of growth. In viewing money as an active agent, we obscure the social relationships that actually give money its power. The Colombian peasants, seeking to explain how money could bear interest, turned to folk beliefs like the &quot;baptism of money&quot; to explain how money could grow. Dishonest individuals would have money baptized, which would then become an active agent; whenever used to buy goods, it would escape the till and return to its owner.

Schrauwers similarly examines a situation where paper money was introduced for the first time, in early nineteenth century Ontario, Canada. Paper money, or bank notes, were not a store of wealth; they were an I.O.U., a &quot;promisory note,&quot; a fetish of debt. Banks in the era had limited capital. They didn&#x27;t loan that capital. Instead, they issued paper notes promising to pay that amount should the note be presented in their office. Since these notes stayed in circulation for lengthy periods, banks had little fear they would have to pay, and so issued many more notes than they could redeem, and charged interest on all of them. Utilizing Bourdieu&#x27;s concept of symbolic capital, Schrauwers examines the way that elite social status was converted into economic capital (the bank note). The bank note&#x27;s value depended entirely on the public&#x27;s perceptions that it could be redeemed, and that perception was based entirely on the social status of the bank&#x27;s shareholders.

===Banking, finance and the stock market===

More recent work has focused on finance capital and stock markets. Anna Tsing for example, analyzed the &quot;Bre-X stock scandal&quot; in Canada and Indonesia in terms of &quot;The economy of appearances.&quot; Ellen Hertz, in contrast, looked at the development of stock markets in Shanghai, China, and the particular ways in which this free market was embedded in local political and cultural realities; markets do not operate in the same manner in all countries. A similar study was done by Karen Ho on Wall Street, in the midst of the financial crisis of 2008. Her book, &quot;Liquidated: an ethnography of Wall Street&quot;, provides an insiders view of how &quot;market rationality&quot; works, and how it is embedded in particular kinds of social networks.

Bill Maurer has examined how Islamic bankers who are seeking to avoid religiously proscribed interest payments have remade money and finance in Indonesia. His book, &quot;Mutual Life, Limited&quot;, compares these Islamic attempts to remake the basis of money to local currency systems in the United States, such as &quot;Ithaca Hours.&quot; In doing so, he questions what it is that gives money its value. This same question of what gives money its value is also addressed in David Graeber&#x27;s book &quot;Towards an Anthropological Theory of Value: The false coin of our own dreams&quot;.

James Carrier has extended the cultural economic and neo-substantivist position by applying their methods to the &quot;science of economics&quot; as a cultural practice. He has edited two collections that examine &quot;free market&quot; ideologies, comparing them to the culturally embedded economic practices they purport to describe. The edited collection, &quot;Meanings of the market: the Free Market in Western Culture&quot;, examined the use of market models in policy-making in the United States. A second edited collection &quot;Virtualism: A New Political Economy,&quot; examined the cultural and social effects on western nations forced to adhere to abstract models of the free market: &quot;Economic models are no longer measured against the world they seek to describe, but instead the world is measured against them, found wanting and made to conform.&quot;

==The anthropology of corporate capitalism==

===Symbolic and economic capital===

Similar insights were developed by Pierre Bourdieu, who also rejected the arguments of the new institutional economists. While these economists attempted to incorporate culture in their models, they did so by arguing that non-market &quot;tradition&quot; was the product of rational maximizing action in the market (i.e., to show they are the solution to an economic problem, rather than having deep cultural roots). Bourdieu argued strongly against what he called RAT (Rational Action Theory) theory, arguing that any actor, when asked for an explanation for their behaviour will provide a rational post hoc answer, but that excuse does not in fact guide the individual in the act. Driving a car is an example; individuals do so out of an acquired &quot;instinct&quot;, obeying the rules of the road without actually focusing upon them. Bourdieu utilized an alternate model, which emphasized how &quot;economic capital&quot; could be translated into &quot;symbolic capital&quot; and vice versa. For example, in traditional Mexican villages, those of wealth would be called upon to fulfill &quot;cargo offices&quot; in the church, and host feasts in honour of the saints. These offices used up their economic capital, but in so doing, it was translated into status (symbolic capital) in the traditional role. This symbolic capital could, in turn, be used to draw customers in the marketplace because of a reputation for honesty and selflessness. 

===Actor-Network theory===
Michel Callon has spearheaded the movement of applying Actor–network theory approaches to study economic life (notably economic markets). This body of work interrogates the interrelation between the economy and economics, highlighting the ways in which economics (and economics-inspired disciplines such as marketing) shapes the economy (see Callon, 1998 and 2005).

===Ethnographies of the corporation===
Corporations are increasingly hiring anthropologists as employees and consultants, leading to an increasingly critical appraisal about the organizational forms of post-modern capitalism. Aihwa Ong&#x27;s &quot;Spirits of resistance and capitalist discipline: factory women in Malaysia&quot; (1987) was pathbreaking in this regard. Her work inspired a generation of anthropologists who have examined the incorporation of women within corporate economies, especially in the new &quot;Free trade zones&quot; of the newly industrializing third world. Others have focused on the former industrialized (now rust-belt) economies. Daromir Rudnyckyj has analyzed how neo-liberal economic discourses have been utilized by Indonesian Muslims operating the Krakatau Steel Company to create a &quot;spiritual economy&quot; conducive to globalization while enhancing the Islamic piety of workers. George Marcus has called for anthropologists to &quot;study up&quot; and to focus on corporate elites, and has edited a series called &quot;Late Editions: Cultural Studies for the End of the Century.&quot;

<doc id="418442" wikidata="Q1077101" url="?curid=418442" title="Dead key">
<text>A dead key is a special kind of modifier key on a mechanical typewriter, or computer keyboard, that is typically used to attach a specific diacritic to a base letter. The dead key does not generate a (complete) character by itself, but modifies the character generated by the key struck immediately after. Thus, a dedicated key is not needed for each possible combination of a diacritic and a letter, but rather only one dead key for each diacritic is needed, in addition to the normal base letter keys.

For example, if a keyboard mapping (such as US international) has a dead key for the circumflex, , the character can be generated by first pressing and then . 

Usually, the diacritic itself can be generated as a free-standing character by pressing the dead key followed by &quot;space&quot;; so a caret (free-standing circumflex) can be typed by pressing and then .

==Mechanical typewriters==
The dead key is mechanical in origin, and &quot;dead&quot; means without movement. On mechanical typebar typewriters, all characters are of equal width. As a key is pressed, a metal typebar strikes the character onto an inked ribbon, transferring ink to the paper, and a mechanism is triggered which causes the paper (inserted in a &quot;carriage&quot;) to move forward one space. To use a single diacritic, such as the acute accent, with multiple foundation characters (such as &quot;á, é, í, ó, ú&quot;) the decision was made to create a new character, the acute accent or diacritic , which did not exist in typesetting as of that date. Due to a change in the mechanism, striking the key containing the accent did not advance the paper (the key was &quot;dead&quot; or non-spacing), meaning it could be followed by any character that was to appear under the acute accent, producing an overstruck character. This second key moved the paper carriage forward.

Note that with mechanical keyboards, the acute accent could be followed by any character, to create new combinations such as &quot;q&quot; with acute accent.

==Electronic keyboards==
A dead key is different from a typical modifier key (such as or ), in that rather than being pressed and held while another key is struck, the dead key is &quot;pressed and released&quot; before striking the key to be modified. In some computer systems, there is no indication to the user that a dead key has been struck, so the key appears dead (nothing immediately happens), but in some text-entry systems, the diacritic is displayed, along with an indication that the system is waiting for another keystroke to complete the typing sequence.

Computers, however, work differently. The dead key temporarily changes the mapping of the keyboard for the next keystroke, which activates a special keyboard mode rather than actually generating a modifier character. Instead of the normal letter, a precomposed variant, with the appropriate diacritic, is generated. Each combination of a diacritic and a base letter must be specified in the character set and must be supported by the computer font in use.

There is no precomposed character to combine the acute accent with the letter , striking and then is likely to result in , with the accent and letter as separate characters. However, in most systems, the invalid typing sequence may be discarded.

==Chained dead keys==

Unicode encoded over one hundred precomposed characters with two diacritics, for use in Latin script for Vietnamese and a number of other languages. For convenience, they are generated on most keyboards supporting them, by pressing the two corresponding deadkeys in any order, followed by the letter key. Therefore, these dead keys are &quot;chained&quot;, which means that the second keystroke does not trigger any insertion, the system being still awaiting another key press.

This &quot;chained dead key&quot; behavior is toggled by the &quot;dead key flag&quot;, which is the fourth argument of the DEADTRANS function (after the base character code, the diacritic code, and the composed character code). If this flag is set to its default value zero, the composed character is inserted; if it is set to one, the composed character code is handled as another diacritic code like those due to dead key presses, and occurs typically as a second argument in other dead list entries.

Chaining dead keys allows for compose key emulation by simply using the dead key feature. This may be performed either with proprietary keyboard editing software, or with driver development kits.

==Dead keys on various keyboard layouts==
A key may function as a dead key by default, and many non-English keyboard layouts in particular have dead keys directly on the keyboard. The basic US keyboard does not have any dead keys, but the US-International keyboard layout, available on Windows and the X Window System, places some dead keys directly on similar-looking punctuation marks. Keyboards sold in most of the rest of the world have an AltGr (Alternative graphic) key, which gives the ability to modify some letters directly and turns others into dead keys (depending on keyboard setting). Old computer systems, such as the MSX, often had a special key labeled &quot;dead key&quot;, which in combination with the Ctrl and Shift keys could be used to add some of the diacritics commonly needed in the Western European languages (codice_1, codice_2, codice_3 and codice_4) to vowels that were typed subsequently.

In the absence of a default dead key, even a normal printing key can temporarily be altered to function as a dead key by simultaneously holding down another modifier key (typically AltGr or Option). In Microsoft Word (and in most other text-input fields), using the Control key with a key that usually resembles the diacritic (e.g. codice_5 for a circumflex) acts as a dead key. On the Macintosh, many keyboard layouts employ dead keys. For example, when are first pressed simultaneously and then followed by , the result is &quot;â&quot;. On a Macintosh, pressing one of these Option-key combinations creates the accent and highlights it, then the final character appears when the key for the base character is pressed.

However, some accented Latin letters less common in the major Western European languages, such as &quot;ŵ&quot; (used in Welsh) or &quot;š&quot; (used in many Central European languages), cannot be typed with the &quot;US&quot; layout. For users with US keyboards, access to many more diacritics is provided by the &quot;US International&quot; keyboard layout. Users with UK keyboards have a similar option with UK extended layout; many other national settings are available.

In AmigaOS, dead keys are generated by pressing in combination with (acute), (grave), (circumflex), (tilde) or (trema) (e.g., the codice_6 combination followed by the codice_7 key generates &quot;á&quot; and codice_6 followed by codice_9 generates &quot;é&quot;, whereas codice_10 followed by codice_7 generates &quot;à&quot; and codice_10 followed by codice_9 generates &quot;è&quot;).

<text>Pellworm (; ; North Frisian &quot;Polweerm&quot;) is a municipality in the district of Nordfriesland, in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.

The municipality is located on the island of Pellworm – one of the North Frisian Islands on the North Sea coast of Germany. Its area is 37 km2, and its population is roughly 1,200. A landmark is the Old Church () with its Arp Schnitger organ from about 1710. Next to this church is the ruin of its 13th-century steeple. The 58 m tall tower collapsed partially in 1611. The 30 m tall ruin has been conserved, so that it is safe for further decay. Locals often call the tower &quot;Finger Gottes&quot;, &quot;God&#x27;s Finger&quot;. The tower is depicted in the coat of arms of Pellworm.

In medieval times Pellworm was a part of the larger island of Strand which was torn into pieces in the disastrous Burchardi flood in 1634. Other remnants of Strand are Nordstrand and the Halligen. All these belonged to the historical region of Uthlande.

Pellworm is accessible by a ferry departing from the neighbouring peninsula of Nordstrand (which is in turn connected with the mainland by a road causeway).

The island hosts one of the largest hybrid renewable energy plants in Europe. It combines 2.7 MW solar panels; 5.7 MW wind energy and 0.5 MW of biogas digestion plant with to provide over 700 MWh/year of electricity. Since the island&#x27;s average electricity production capacity exceeds its average demand multiple times, yet there is a time mismatch between the two, this site was chosen for EU&#x27;s largest stationary energy storage facility ca. 2015. In 2022 the island hosts a 560 kW/560 kWh lithium-ion battery, a 200 kW/1600 kWh vanadium flow battery, and a thermal storage unit. Gildemeister, now Cellcube part of Enerox, supplied the vanadium battery.

Together with several smaller islands, Pellworm forms the &quot;Amt&quot; of Pellworm.

<text>Wansdyke (from &quot;Woden&#x27;s Dyke&quot;) is a series of early medieval defensive linear earthworks in the West Country of England, consisting of a ditch and a running embankment from the ditch spoil, with the ditching facing north.

There are two main parts: an eastern dyke which runs between Savernake Forest, West Woods and Morgan&#x27;s Hill in Wiltshire, and a western dyke which runs from Monkton Combe to the ancient hill fort of Maes Knoll in historic Somerset. Between these two dykes there is a middle section formed by the remains of the London-to-Bath Roman road. There is also some evidence in charters that it extended west from Maes Knoll to the coast of the Severn Estuary but this is uncertain. It may possibly define a post-Roman boundary.

==Usage==
Wansdyke consists of two sections, long with some gaps in between. East Wansdyke is an impressive linear earthwork, consisting of a ditch and bank running approximately east–west, between Savernake Forest and Morgan&#x27;s Hill. West Wansdyke is also a linear earthwork, running from Monkton Combe south of Bath to Maes Knoll south of Bristol, but less substantial than its eastern counterpart. The middle section, long, is sometimes referred to as &#x27;Mid Wansdyke&#x27;, but is formed by the remains of the London to Bath Roman road. It used to be thought that these sections were all part of one continuous undertaking, especially during the Middle Ages when the pagan name Wansdyke was applied to all three parts. However, this is not now considered to be certain.

==Defence of an unrecorded border==
Among the largest defensive earthworks in the United Kingdom, Wansdyke may be compared to both Offa&#x27;s Dyke (later, and forming a Mercian border with Wales) and Hadrian&#x27;s Wall (earlier, and forming a border between Britannia and Caledonia). Nennius, an 8th-century Welsh monk who had access to older chronicles since lost, describes these defences and their purpose, and links them to the legends of King Arthur.

==Nomenclature and dating==
The earthwork is named after their god &quot;Woden&quot; (Odin), possibly indicating that the incoming Anglo-Saxons had no information about the origins of a structure that was there when they arrived, and which was of no significance to locals at that time. Its name occurs in charters of the 9th and 10th century AD. Its relationship to the expansion of the West Saxons was considered in 1964 by J.N.L. Myres, who maintained that Wansdyke was constructed by some sub-Roman authority. Fowler speculates that it was a fortification intended for use against invading Saxons in the 490s, and abandoned when the news of British victory at Mons Badonicus made it redundant. The name &#x27;Woden&#x27;s Dyke&#x27; eventually became Wansdyke.

==East Wansdyke== 
East Wansdyke in Wiltshire, on the south of the Marlborough Downs, has been less disturbed by later agriculture and building, and is more clearly traceable on the ground than the western part. In places the bank is up to high and the ditch as much as deep. Since at least the tenth century, there have been gaps, &quot;gates&quot;, in the work. The ditch is on the north side, so Wansdyke may have been intended by the Romano-Britons as a defence against West Saxons encroaching from the upper Thames Valley westward into what is now the West Country. Fowler suggests that its plan is consistent with those of Roman border fortifications such as Hadrian&#x27;s Wall: not just a military defence but intended to control locals and travellers along the Wessex Ridgeway. He suggests further that the works were never finished, abandoned in the face of a political change which removed their rationale.

Lieut.-General Augustus Pitt Rivers carried out excavations at the Wansdyke in Wiltshire in the late 19th century, considering it the remains of a great war in which the south-west was being defended. In 1958, Fox and Fox attributed its construction to the pagan Saxons, probably in the late sixth century.

==West Wansdyke==
Although the antiquarians like John Collinson considered West Wansdyke to stretch from Bathampton Down south east of Bath, to the west of Maes Knoll, a review in 1960 considered that there was no evidence of its existence to the west of Maes Knoll. Keith Gardner refuted this with newly discovered documentary evidence. In 2007 a series of sections were dug across the earthwork which showed that it had existed where there are no longer visible surface remains. It was shown that the earthwork had a consistent design, with stone or timber revetment. There was little dating evidence but it was consistent with either a late Roman or post-Roman date. A paper in &quot;The Last of the Britons&quot; conference in 2007 suggests that the West Wansdyke continues from Maes Knoll to the hill forts above the Avon Gorge and controls the crossings of the river at Saltford and Bristol as well as at Bath.

As there is little archaeological evidence to date the whole section, it may have marked a division between British Celtic kingdoms or have been a boundary with the Saxons. The evidence for its western extension is earthworks along the north side of Dundry Hill, its mention in a charter and a road name.

The area became the border between the Romano-British Celts and the West Saxons following the Battle of Deorham in 577 AD.
According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, the Saxon Cenwalh achieved a breakthrough against the Britons, with victories at Bradford on Avon (in the &quot;Avon Gap&quot; in the Wansdyke) in 652 AD,
and further south at the Battle of Peonnum (at Penselwood) in 658 AD,
followed by an advance west through the Polden Hills to the River Parrett. It is however significant to note that the names of the early Wessex kings appear to have a Brythonic (British) rather than Germanic (Saxon) etymology.

A section of Wansdyke in Odd Down, which has been designated as an Ancient monument, appears on the Heritage at Risk Register as being in unsatisfactory condition and vulnerable due to gardening.

==Modern use of name==
The Western Wansdyke gave its name to the former Wansdyke district of the county of Avon, and also to the Wansdyke constituency.

<text>Borknagar is a Norwegian progressive metal band with black metal and folk influences. It was founded in Bergen in 1995 by Øystein Garnes Brun primarily as a black metal band before later switching to a more melodic and progressive style. Borknagar&#x27;s lyrics often deal with philosophy, paganism, nature and the cosmos. The band has released twelve studio albums.

==History==
Borknagar was founded by Øystein Brun, then a member of the Norwegian death metal band Molested, when he became tired of the brutal aspects of the band&#x27;s music. Øystein formed Borknagar to explore a more melodic outlet of expression, inspired by the burgeoning black metal movement Norway was experiencing and looking to push the boundaries of what was considered &quot;traditional&quot; black metal music. He wrote all of the music and lyrics and gathered together an all-star group of black metal musicians to play in his band, such as Infernus of Gorgoroth, Grim of Immortal and Gorgoroth and Ivar Bjørnson of Enslaved. When Garm of Ulver, Head Control System and Arcturus joined the project, it brought the band immediate attention. The band never even recorded a demo; they simply asked for a record contract on Malicious Records and were granted their request based on the strength of this lineup. Borknagar&#x27;s music instantly gained fans and received positive press attention. In 1999, Grim died. He was replaced by Justin Greaves who left shortly after to be replaced by Asgeir Mickelson.

Borknagar has released twelve albums to date. Their self-titled debut album features lyrics solely in Norwegian; all subsequent albums have featured lyrics written in English exclusively (however, &quot;The Olden Domain&quot; featured an instrumental track titled in Norwegian). Aside from Brun&#x27;s lyrical contributions, the band has featured lyrics by other members as well: ICS Vortex from Arcturus and ex-Dimmu Borgir, drummer Asgeir Mickelson, keyboardist Lars Nedland and by vocalist Vintersorg from Otyg and his eponymous band. Bassist Jan Erik Tiwaz (a.k.a. Tyr) wrote the song &#x27;The View of Everlast&#x27;. Borknagar has toured with various bands including Emperor, Peccatum, In Flames, Morbid Angel and Cradle of Filth.

Borknagar released a lighter album, &quot;Origin&quot;, which is &quot;an acoustic effort based entirely on the epic and progressive aspect of the band&quot;, according to Øystein G. Brun&#x27;s statement on heavy metal website Blabbermouth.net.

In late December 2007, the band signed a three-album deal with the Norwegian label Indie Recordings. In March 2008, Asgeir posted an announcement from Øystein on UltimateMetal forums stating that Erik Tiwaz and Jens F. Ryland had again become official members of the band, and that the band were aiming for a January 2009 release. In May 2008, Øystein released another statement announcing Asgeir&#x27;s departure as the band&#x27;s drummer, due to &quot;evolving differences in musical ideas and visions [...] The split happens in friendly manner and with mutual respect for the decision that he has made. He will remain a good friend of the band.&quot; A new drummer, the American David Kinkade, who had worked with Arsis and Malevolent Creation joined the band.

In April 2009, the band announced that their upcoming album is titled &quot;Universal&quot;. The album, scheduled for a September release was postponed to a February 2010 release.

In early June 2010, Jan Erik Tiwaz left the bass guitarist position of Borknagar due to &quot;general disagreements&quot;, and ICS Vortex replaced him and Vintersorg on the upcoming tour.

Also in June 2010, the band announced their first tour of South America, with ICS Vortex on vocals. On 25 August 2010, the band announced that they were forced to cancel the South American tour due to reasons beyond their control.

In January 2011, the deal with Indie Recordings were terminated and on 28 March 2011 Borknagar signed a new worldwide 3 album deal with Century Media Records.

On 22 April 2011, the band officially announced the return of ICS Vortex on both bass and vocals.

Drummer Dave Kinkade announced on his official Facebook page on 25 October 2011 that he had &quot;mutually parted ways with Borknagar&quot; and that he&#x27;ll &quot;be focusing 100% on Soulfly now&quot;.

On 22 February 2012, it was announced on the Norwegian website Artisan that the new drummer for the band would be Baard Kolstad.

Throughout 2014 and into 2015, the band had been hard at work writing and recording their next full-length album, &quot;Winter Thrice&quot;. Production had to be delayed due to injuries vocalist Vintersorg suffered in late 2014 but the recording was concluded in June. Original vocalist Kristoffer Rygg provided guest vocals on the aforementioned record.

In early 2019, it was reported that long-time vocalist Vintersorg has parted ways with the band due to conflicting issues with his work and family, as well as the after effects of his 2014 injuries. The split was amicable and he has not ruled out being a guest on a future album. As well, drummer Baard Kolstad also parted ways due to lack of time due to his other in-demand projects. ICS Vortex has since reassumed the role of lead vocalist and Kolstad was replaced by Bjørn Dugstad Rønnow (at Kolstad&#x27;s recommendation). Despite these setbacks, Borknagar released their eleventh album, &quot;True North&quot;, on 27 September 2019.

On 15 December 2023, the band announced that their twelfth studio album &quot;Fall&quot; would be released on 23 February 2024. At the same time, they released the lead single &quot;Summits&quot; along with a visualizer video.

<text>KPFA (94.1 FM) is a public, listener-funded talk radio and music radio station located in Berkeley, California, broadcasting to the San Francisco Bay Area. KPFA airs public news, public affairs, talk, and music programming. The station signed on the air April 15, 1949, as the first Pacifica Radio station and remains the flagship station of the Pacifica Radio Network.

The station&#x27;s studios are located in Downtown Berkeley, and its transmitter site is located in the Berkeley Hills.

==History==
Launched in 1949, three years after the Pacifica Foundation was created by pacifist Lewis Hill, KPFA became the first station in the Pacifica Radio network and the first listener-supported radio broadcaster in the United States. Previously, non-commercial stations were licensed only to serve educational functions as extensions of high schools, colleges, and universities. This departure into listener-oriented programming brought many detractors as KPFA aired controversial programming. The first interview with anyone from the gay political movement was broadcast by KPFA, as well as Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s poem &quot;Howl&quot; in the 1950s. In 1954 the broadcast by a group of marijuana reform advocates extolling the pleasures of cannabis resulted in the tape being impounded by the California Attorney General. In the 1960s KPFA and Pacifica were accused of being controlled by the Communist Party, and several challenges to its license were waged, none of them successful.

KPFA was the first station to broadcast a radio show specializing in space music, with the debut of Stephen Hill and Anna Turner&#x27;s &quot;Music from the Hearts of Space&quot; in 1973. Ten years later, the show – now known by the shorter title &quot;Hearts of Space&quot; – was syndicated in the U.S. to NPR stations, while remaining at its first home at KPFA.

In the 1970s and 1980s, it broadcast a weekly long-running radio program called &quot;Fruit Punch&quot; for gay and lesbian listeners.

Since 1981, the station is known for airing the pioneering culture jamming sound collage show &quot;Over the Edge&quot;. Originally hosted by Don Joyce of Negativland, it is the longest-running block of free-form audio collage in radio history.

KPFA is also known for Puzzling Evidence, the longest running radio program of the Church of the Subgenius hosted by Doug Wellman and Harry S. Robins. The program was the inspiration for the Talking Heads song of the same name from the band&#x27;s film &quot;True Stories&quot;.

==Labor disputes==
In 1999 the station was effectively taken over by KPFA&#x27;s governing Pacifica Foundation, after Dennis Bernstein, the long-established host of the station&#x27;s &quot;Flashpoints&quot; news magazine, was forcibly removed by police for airing grievances on air over a labor dispute. A broad cross section of protesters joined in direct action outside of the station in a weeks-long lockout during which station management spent over half a million dollars on security measures.
At one point, listeners created a separate fund to accept listener pledges that would be directed away from the Pacifica Foundation.

In 2007, KPFA derecognized its Unpaid Staff Organization. The staff claimed that Pacifica Radio had been making network more corporate, softening its voice of dissent, and attempting to get rid of some of the volunteers at the station. In 2008, a forcible removal by police of a KPFA volunteer highlighted the concerns between management and volunteer staff.

A member of the KPFA board suggested that it was problematic that there was no grievance procedure for unpaid staff at the station.

In November 2010, the management of Pacifica laid off most of the staff of the popular KPFA Morning Show. The union representing the paid staff of KPFA claims that the lay offs were done in violation of the union contract. Pacifica management says the lay offs were financially necessary and done according to staff seniority. Pacifica management replaced the paid staff of the Morning Show with an all volunteer crew.

==Affiliated stations==
KPFA&#x27;s sister stations are WBAI New York, KPFT Houston, KPFK Los Angeles, and WPFW Washington. Pacifica continues today to be a listener-supported network of stations. The main KPFA transmitter is a 59 kilowatt class B, though there is a booster KPFA-FM3 in Oakley. KPFB 89.3 is a smaller station, also in Berkeley, that covers areas of Berkeley that are shielded from the main KPFA signal by the Berkeley Hills. It also carries some separate programming specifically for its Berkeley audience. KPFA programs are also rebroadcast by KFCF in Fresno. KZFR in Chico also carries KPFA&#x27;s programming from 2:00-6:00 a.m. daily. KZSC Santa Cruz simultaneously broadcasts KPFA&#x27;s Pacifica Evening News on weeknights. In the Bay Area, Comcast carries KPFA&#x27;s broadcasts on cable channel 967, as part of its digital radio offering. The channel is labeled &quot;Variety/Berkeley&quot;.

<text>A weather map, also known as synoptic weather chart, displays various meteorological features across a particular area at a particular point in time and has various symbols which all have specific meanings. Such maps have been in use since the mid-19th century and are used for research and weather forecasting purposes. Maps using isotherms show temperature gradients, which can help locate weather fronts. Isotach maps, analyzing lines of equal wind speed, on a constant pressure surface of 300 or 250 hPa show where the jet stream is located. Use of constant pressure charts at the 700 and 500 hPa level can indicate tropical cyclone motion. Two-dimensional streamlines based on wind speeds at various levels show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field, which are helpful in determining the location of features within the wind pattern. A popular type of surface weather map is the surface weather analysis, which plots isobars to depict areas of high pressure and low pressure. Cloud codes are translated into symbols and plotted on these maps along with other meteorological data that are included in synoptic reports sent by professionally trained observers.

== History ==
The use of weather charts in a modern sense began in the middle portion of the 19th century in order to devise a theory on storm systems. During the Crimean War a storm devastated the French fleet at Balaklava, and the French scientist Urbain Le Verrier was able to show that if a chronological map of the storm had been issued, the path it would take could have been predicted and avoided by the fleet.

In England, the scientist Francis Galton heard of this work, as well as the pioneering weather forecasts of Robert FitzRoy. After gathering information from weather stations across the country for the month of October 1861, he plotted the data on a map using his own system of symbols, thereby creating the world&#x27;s first weather map. He used his map to prove that air circulated clockwise around areas of high pressure; he coined the term &#x27;anticyclone&#x27; to describe the phenomenon. He was also instrumental in publishing the first weather map in a newspaper, for which he modified the pantograph (an instrument for copying drawings) to inscribe the map onto printing blocks. &quot;The Times&quot; began printing weather maps using these methods with data from the Meteorological Office.

The introduction of country-wide weather maps required the existence of national telegraph networks so that data from across the country could be gathered in real time and remain relevant for all analysis. The first such use of the telegraph for gathering data on the weather was the &quot;Manchester Examiner&quot; newspaper in 1847:

It was also important for time to be standardized across time zones so that the information on the map should accurately represent the weather at a given time. A standardized time system was first used to coordinate the British railway network in 1847, with the inauguration of Greenwich Mean Time.

In the US, The Smithsonian Institution developed its network of observers over much of the central and eastern United States between the 1840s and 1860s once Joseph Henry took the helm. The U.S. Army Signal Corps inherited this network between 1870 and 1874 by an act of Congress, and expanded it to the west coast soon afterwards. At first, not all the data on the map was used due to a lack of time standardization. The United States fully adopted time zones in 1905, when Detroit finally established standard time.

=== 20th century ===
The use of frontal zones on weather maps began in the 1910s in Norway. Polar front theory is attributed to Jacob Bjerknes, derived from a coastal network of observation sites in Norway during World War I. This theory proposed that the main inflow into a cyclone was concentrated along two lines of convergence, one ahead of the low and another trailing behind the low. The convergence line ahead of the low became known as either the steering line or the warm front. The trailing convergence zone was referred to as the squall line or cold front. Areas of clouds and rainfall appeared to be focused along these convergence zones. The concept of frontal zones led to the concept of air masses. The nature of the three-dimensional structure of the cyclone would wait for the development of the upper air network during the 1940s. Since the leading edge of air mass changes bore resemblance to the military fronts of World War I, the term &quot;front&quot; came into use to represent these lines.
The United States began to formally analyze fronts on surface analyses in late 1942, when the WBAN Analysis Center opened in downtown Washington, D.C.

In addition to surface weather maps, weather agencies began to generate constant pressure charts. In 1948, the United States began the Daily Weather Map series, which at first analyzed the 700 hPa level, which is around above sea level. By May 14, 1954, the 500 hPa surface was being analyzed, which is about above sea level. The effort to automate map plotting began in the United States in 1969, with the process complete in the 1970s. A similar initiative was started in India by Indian Meteorological Department in 1969. Hong Kong completed their process of automated surface plotting by 1987.

By 1999, computer systems and software had finally become sophisticated enough to allow for the ability to underlay on the same workstation satellite imagery, radar imagery, and model-derived fields such as atmospheric thickness and frontogenesis in combination with surface observations to make for the best possible surface analysis. In the United States, this development was achieved when Intergraph workstations were replaced by n-AWIPS workstations. By 2001, the various surface analyses done within the National Weather Service were combined into the Unified Surface Analysis, which is issued every six hours and combines the analyses of four different centers. Recent advances in both the fields of meteorology and geographic information systems have made it possible to devise finely tailored products that take us from the traditional weather map into an entirely new realm. Weather information can quickly be matched to relevant geographical detail. For instance, icing conditions can be mapped onto the road network. This will likely continue to lead to changes in the way surface analyses are created and displayed over the next several years.

== Plotting of data ==

A station model is a symbolic illustration showing the weather occurring at a given reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to plot a number of weather elements in a small space on weather maps. Maps filled with dense station-model plots can be difficult to read, but they allow meteorologists, pilots, and mariners to see important weather patterns. A computer draws a station model for each observation location. The station model is primarily used on surface-weather maps, but can also be used to show the weather aloft. A completed station-model map allows users to analyze patterns in air pressure, temperature, wind, cloud cover, and precipitation.

Station model plots use an internationally accepted coding convention that has changed little since August 1, 1941. Elements in the plot show the key weather elements, including temperature, dewpoint, wind, cloud cover, air pressure, pressure tendency, and precipitation. Winds have a standard notation when plotted on weather maps. More than a century ago, winds were plotted as arrows, with feathers on just one side depicting five knots of wind, while feathers on both sides depicted of wind. The notation changed to that of half of an arrow, with half of a wind barb indicating five knots, a full barb ten knots, and a pennant flag fifty knots.

Because of the structure of the SYNOP code, a maximum of three cloud symbols can be plotted for each reporting station that appears on the weather map. All cloud types are coded and transmitted by trained observers then plotted on maps as low, middle, or high-étage using special symbols for each major cloud type. Any cloud type with significant vertical extent that can occupy more than one étage is coded as low (cumulus and cumulonimbus) or middle (nimbostratus) depending on the altitude level or étage where it normally initially forms aside from any vertical growth that takes place. The symbol used on the map for each of these étages at a particular observation time is for the genus, species, variety, mutation, or cloud motion that is considered most important according to criteria set out by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). If these elements for any étage at the time of observation are deemed to be of equal importance, then the type which is predominant in amount is coded by the observer and plotted on the weather map using the appropriate symbol. Special weather maps in aviation show areas of icing and turbulence.

== Types ==
=== Aviation maps ===

Aviation interests have their own set of weather maps. One type of map shows where VFR (visual flight rules) are in effect and where IFR (instrument flight rules) are in effect. Weather depiction plots show ceiling height (level where at least half the sky is covered with clouds) in hundreds of feet, present weather, and cloud cover. Icing maps depict areas where icing can be a hazard for flying. Aviation-related maps also show areas of turbulence.

=== Constant pressure charts ===
Constant pressure charts normally contain plotted values of temperature, humidity, wind, and the vertical height above sea level of the pressure surface. They have a variety of uses. In the mountainous terrain of the western United States and Mexican Plateau, the 850 hPa pressure surface can be a more realistic depiction of the weather pattern than a standard surface analysis. Using the 850 and 700 hPa pressure surfaces, one can determine when and where warm advection (coincident with upward vertical motion) and cold advection (coincident with downward vertical motion) is occurring within the lower portions of the troposphere. Areas with small dewpoint depressions and are below freezing indicate the presence of icing conditions for aircraft. The 500 hPa pressure surface can be used as a rough guide for the motion of many tropical cyclones. Shallower tropical cyclones, which have experienced vertical wind shear, tend to be steered by winds at the 700 hPa level.

Use of the 300 and 200 hPa constant pressure charts can indicate the strength of systems in the lower troposphere, as stronger systems near the Earth&#x27;s surface are reflected as stronger features at these levels of the atmosphere. Isotachs are drawn at these levels, which a lines of equal wind speed. They are helpful in finding maxima and minima in the wind pattern. Minima in the wind pattern aloft are favorable for tropical cyclogenesis. Maxima in the wind pattern at various levels of the atmosphere show locations of jet streams. Areas colder than indicate a lack of significant icing, as long as there is no active thunderstorm activity.

=== Surface weather analysis ===

A surface weather analysis is a type of weather map that depicts positions for high and low-pressure areas, as well as various types of synoptic scale systems such as frontal zones. Isotherms can be drawn on these maps, which are lines of equal temperature. Isotherms are drawn normally as solid lines at a preferred temperature interval. They show temperature gradients, which can be useful in finding fronts, which are on the warm side of large temperature gradients. By plotting the freezing line, isotherms can be useful in determination of precipitation type. Mesoscale boundaries such as tropical cyclones, outflow boundaries and squall lines also are analyzed on surface weather analyses.

Isobaric analysis is performed on these maps, which involves the construction of lines of equal mean sea level pressure. The innermost closed lines indicate the positions of relative maxima and minima in the pressure field. The minima are called low-pressure areas while the maxima are called high-pressure areas. Highs are often shown as H&#x27;s whereas lows are shown as L&#x27;s. Elongated areas of low pressure, or troughs, are sometimes plotted as thick, brown dashed lines down the trough axis. Isobars are commonly used to place surface boundaries from the horse latitudes poleward, while streamline analyses are used in the tropics. A streamline analysis is a series of arrows oriented parallel to wind, showing wind motion within a certain geographic area. &quot;C&quot;s depict cyclonic flow or likely areas of low pressure, while &quot;A&quot;s depict anticyclonic flow or likely positions of high-pressure areas. An area of confluent streamlines shows the location of shearlines within the tropics and subtropics.

<text>A criminal record (not to be confused with a police record or arrest record) is a record of a person&#x27;s criminal convictions history. The information included in a criminal record, and the existence of a criminal record, varies between countries and even between jurisdictions within a country. In most cases it lists all non-expunged criminal offences and may also include traffic offences such as speeding and drunk driving. In most countries, a criminal record is limited to unexpunged and unexpired actual convictions (where the individual has pleaded guilty or been found guilty by a qualified court, resulting in the entry of a conviction), while in some it can also include arrests, charges dismissed, charges pending and charges of which the individual has been acquitted. The term rap sheet refers to &quot;Record of Arrest and Prosecution&quot;, similar to a criminal record.

A criminal history may be used by potential employers, lenders, and others to assess a person&#x27;s trustworthiness. Criminal records may also be relevant for international travel, and for the charging and sentencing of persons who commit additional criminal offenses.

==Australia==
Individuals in Australia can obtain a national criminal history to check themselves, and certain organisations can apply for one on their behalf. A person may be required to undergo a criminal record check for a variety of reasons, including employment screening, volunteer work, preparing for a court appearance, visa applications, firearms licensing, or to satisfy a statutory requirement. Individuals can obtain a national criminal history through two ways:
# Their local police service.
# An Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) – accredited organisations such as employing institutions, or commercial background checking service providers. A list of ACIC accredited agencies is available from their website. Some of the commercial providers allow online application, real time responses, and online verification.

The Working With Children Check, which is used to screen workers and volunteers in child-related work, is a specific check for those whose criminal records are deemed to pose a high risk to children.

==Austria==
In Austria, criminal records and &quot;Strafregisterbescheinigung&quot; (criminal record certificate) are maintained by the Register Division (&quot;Strafregisteramt&quot;) of Federal Police Bureau Vienna (&quot;Bundespolizeidirektion Wien&quot;).
In order to access a criminal record in Austria, a person must complete a form with relevant identification and pay a fee (in July 2014, currently 28.60 Euro, or 16.40 Euro if it is for the purposes of employment). Requests for a criminal record certificate can be taken to police stations and will be processed and provided to the applicant immediately, or a person can request for a hard-copy to be posted to an address within Austria.
In Austria, a request for a criminal record certificate can come in two forms – restricted and unrestricted disclosure. An application at the request of a future employer will be issued a restricted disclosure, which only contains unexpunged convictions and may not include less serious convictions. An unrestricted disclosure certificate is exclusively for specific state agencies (for example, firearms licensing bodies, military and law enforcement agencies), and, even then, is only issued in specific circumstances. This type of criminal record certificate contains details of all convictions.
All criminal offences are recorded on the Criminal Register. Convictions are removed from the Criminal Register upon expiry of the penalty, which generally occurs when the penalty ends, but can extend to up fifteen years after the penalty has been completed. The only exception is life sentences which are not removed from the Criminal Register.
Austria maintains a sex offender registry; however, this is for law enforcement and intelligence purposes only.

==Belgium==
In Belgium, there is a national central criminal record system which records, keeps and modifies data related to penal decisions. The criminal record system is maintained by the Federal Public Service Justice.
The criminal records held within the central system contain the following data: criminal record number; name, surname and given name; date and place of birth; gender; residence; profession; nationality; court; number of judges; degree of jurisdiction; reference, number and date of judgement; date of transmission to central criminal record; sentence pronounced, place and date of the criminal acts.
The central system contains records of
:a) Penal convictions for all types of offence;
:b) Penal convictions of guilt subjecting the convicted person to a probationary period;
:c) Decisions of revocation of the previous category;
:d) Penal decisions concerning confinement of mentally ill offenders;
:e) Deprivation of parental rights, and reintegration, as well as several measures regarding delinquent minors;
:f) Several decisions which quash prior judgements;
:g) Several decisions of retraction;
:h) Decisions that rectify or interpret the law on which the conviction has been decided;
:i) Decisions of rehabilitation;
:j) Decisions of pardon;
:k) Decisions of release on parole;
:l) Decisions from foreign jurisdictions regarding Belgian citizens;
:m) Sentences accompanying a main sentence, subsidiary sentences, &#x27;security measures&#x27;, and deferred sentences
There is no record of dismissed cases or verdicts of not guilty.
To access their own criminal record, a person can seek it from their local police authority or send a written request to the Federal Public Service Justice. In terms of public access to criminal records, the following persons and judicial and administrative bodies may be able to gain access to records through the Federal Public Service Justice.
*Corporations: corporations, association, etc.
*Individuals when the document should be used abroad
*Foreigners for the period of their stay in Belgium
*Specific categories (e.g. diplomats)

Two kinds of erasure exist in the Belgian system: The real erasure is the disappearance of the conviction, and applies only to police sentences (small fines and 8 days of imprisonment or less). For all other sentences, a system of &quot;no mention&quot; applies, whereby the conviction remains recorded in the central system but is no longer available for access by several categories of people.

==Bulgaria==
Disclosure of criminal records in Bulgaria is governed by Regulation No 8/26.02.2008 for the Functions and Organisation of the Activity of the Criminal Records Offices. The criminal record system for citizens of Bulgaria are kept in the Criminal Records Office located at every Regional Court in Bulgaria, and the Central Office of Criminal Records at the Ministry of Justice. There are two types of criminal records disclosed in Bulgaria; Conviction Status Certificate, and the Verification of Conviction Status. The Conviction Status Certificate contains personal information about the concerned individual (full name, personal identification number, date and place of birth, nationality, names of parents), details of all the convictions and the purpose of the Certificate. This Certificate is valid for 6 months from the date it was issued, and can only be applied for by the concerned individual, relative of individual, legal heir of the concerned individual, or a power of attorney. The Verification of Conviction Status contains personal information about the concerned individual (full name, personal identification number, date and place of birth, nationality, names of parents), details of all convictions, including whether rehabilitation was required, and information about all imposed administrative sanctions. There is no term of validity for this status; however, it can only be issued for an official purpose by governmental or law enforcement authorities. These records can be accessed through application to the Central Office of Criminal Records. The cost is approximately €2.60.

The Bulgarian Penal Code allows the removal of conviction data for individuals, known as the &#x27;rehabilitation of individuals&#x27;. This can be awarded by a court of law given that the individual has demonstrated good conduct, and has compensated any damages. A second type of rehabilitation is known as rehabilitation de jure which enacts new legislation. This can occur if the individually has been sentenced conditionally, the individual has been sentenced to up to three years&#x27; imprisonment and has not committed any other crimes punishable by imprisonment, the individual was sentenced to a fine, public reprimand or deprivation of civil rights, and they have not committed another crime the year following. Additionally, judgments are removed from a criminal record after the sentence has been served and the following time has elapsed:
* For life imprisonment without substitution or life imprisonment: 20 years
* For imprisonment of over 10 years: 15 years
* Imprisonment between 3 and 10 years: 10 years
* Imprisonment between of less than 3 years: 5 years
* All remaining cases: 2 years

==Canada==
In Canada, criminal records are stored in Criminal Records Information Management Services, a centralized database operated by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police under the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC) since 1972. The database includes all convictions for which a pardon has not been granted, all charges regardless of disposition, outstanding warrants and charges, all judicial orders and other information that might be of interest to police investigations.

===Screening===
There are two types of criminal record checks: standard and vulnerable sector. Vulnerable sector is defined under the &quot;Criminal Records Act&quot; as minor (less than 18 years of age) andThere are 4 levels of standard criminal record checks—levels 1 to 4. Level 1 is the most basic check and level 4 being the most extensive. Criminal record checks can only be done with the consent of the individual. Due to the sensitive nature of CPIC, only police agencies are authorized to conduct a criminal record check, with the exception of BC Ministry of Justice.
* Level 1: Records of criminal convictions for which a pardon has not been granted (CPIC Level 1 Query)
* Level 2: Level 1 + outstanding charges that the police force is aware of (CPIC Level 1 Query + Persons Query)
* Level 3: Level 2 + records of discharges which have not been removed (all charges regardless of disposition) (CPIC Level 2 Query + Persons Query)
* Level 4: Level 3 + check on local police databases, court and law enforcement agency databases (also known as &quot;Police Record Check&quot;). The vulnerable sector screening includes a level 4 check plus any sexual offences and convictions for which a pardon was granted.

In the event that the name and date of birth of the applicant matches any sexual offence record in the system, he/she is required to submit fingerprints to the RCMP for a physical confirmation. Criminal record check is an integral part of the process for obtaining security clearances regardless of level of access. Some provinces may require high-risk professions to be screened to ensure public safety. For example, the BC Ministry of Justice requires all healthcare professionals, practicum students in healthcare, childcare facilities staff and volunteers, school and hospital staff regardless of position to undergo a CRC via the Criminal Records Review Program.

===Pardon===

Criminal offences can be pardoned either by the Governor General of Canada, Parole Board of Canada or through an Order in Council by the federal government, as determined by the crime involved under the &quot;Criminal Records Act&quot;. Pardon has been renamed as record suspension under Bill C-10, otherwise known as the omnibus crime bill or by its formal name &quot;Safe Streets and Communities Act&quot;, introduced by the Conservative government in 2011. The change officially came into force on 13 March 2012. In 2017, two provincial superior courts struck down the retroactive nature of these changes as unconstitutional. As a result, pardons are currently being granted to residents of BC and Ontario who were convicted prior to 2012.

==Chile==
In Chile, citizens can request their own criminal records at the Civil Registrations office or the Registro Civil. According to the Article 19 N°16 of the Constitution of Chile, an employer cannot discriminate based on anything else but personal capabilities to perform at the job offered. One can eliminate one&#x27;s criminal records by a voluntary checkup, providing your signature two years for first offenses, or five years for more. A person must be complaint of the requisites provided by the law No. 409.

==Croatia==
The Criminal Code of Croatia: The Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia &quot;Narodne novine&quot; entered into force on 1 January 1998.

Under Article 86, criminal record data may be given only to courts and state attorney&#x27;s offices when a criminal case is brought against the person. Governmental bodies can access this data upon a reasonable request and must be related to specific tasks in public service to be entrusted to the person for whom such information is requested. The police can also gain access with the intention of discovering the perpetrator of a criminal act. Other members of the general public do not have the right to demand that citizens submit records concerning their convictions. A citizen retains the right to access data from their own criminal record, only under the condition that the purpose is to exercise his rights in another state.

Certificates of criminal records are issued from the Department for Criminal Records. To be expunged of any conviction from one&#x27;s criminal record, Article 19 of the Law on Legal Consequences of Conviction, Rehabilitation and Criminal Records (Official Gazette 143/12) needs to be referred to.

==Cyprus==
In Cyprus, criminal records are held by the Criminal Investigation Office of Cyprus Police which forms part of the Republic of Cyprus Minister of Justice and Public Order. A Clear Criminal Record Certificate or existing Criminal Record can be requested by individuals through application to the Criminal Investigation Office. Applications can be made in person at the Central Police Station in Nicosia. Criminal records in Cyprus are maintained for life.

Cyprus introduced legislation in 2014 allowing for the creation of a sex offenders register. The legislation also provides for inclusion of a greater European Union sex offender registry.
There are different procedures and protocols for the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.

==Czech Republic==
The Czech Republic took part in the Network of Judicial Registers pilot project, with 10 other countries, exchanging information on criminal records electronically.
The criminal record system of the Czech Republic is a computerized system.
Criminal record information is maintained at the Criminal Records Office in Prague—which is state-funded and can be found at the offices of the Ministry of Justice.

Individuals can request An Excerpt from the Penal Register for personal access only. Applications can be made from Czech Republic embassies, and also by prospective employers for people who have been a resident or citizen of the Czech Republic. Data on corporate criminal records are accessible by the general public.
Length of time that individuals are on the criminal record system.
Criminal convictions remain on record for an indefinite period. Under certain conditions, the Court will expunge convictions after 15 years in an exceptional sentence, 10 years if there conviction of the sentence does not exceed 5 years, 5 years if the sentence of imprisonment does not exceed one year.

==Denmark==
The Danish criminal record certificate is titled &quot;Privat Straffeattest&quot; and is the responsibility of the National Police Authority (the Rigspolitiet). The Danish Data Protection Agency governs the legislation in relation to criminal records and provides certain restrictions. Criminal convictions on the certificate include all violations of the Denmark Criminal Code. There are varying time frames for which convictions remain on an individual&#x27;s criminal record. For example, fines remain on the record for 2 years from the date of payment, unconditional convictions for 5 years from date of release from prison, and suspended sentences for 3 years from the conviction date. Any older convictions will be struck from the record.

In order to obtain a criminal record check in Denmark an individual or third party (with written consent) can apply in person at a local police station or by way of email to the National Police Authority. Available languages for the certificate include English, German, Danish, French and Spanish where there are no convictions. When there are convictions, the only available language for the certificate is Danish. The certificate is issue free of charge and the turnaround ranges from immediate access to 2 days.
Denmark does not allow the transfer of criminal records to foreign authorities or to the Europol database for storage.

In Denmark, child sex abuse information is contained in two registers, the National Patient Register and the Criminal Register. The National Patient Register contains all hospital contacts including inpatient, outpatient and emergency department contacts. The Danish National Criminal Register of child sex abuse contains data relating to cases reported to the Danish police. Any sexual relationship with an individual below the age of 15 is prohibited by law as the Danish age of sexual consent is 15. Cases involving child sexual abuse are classified into three different categories according to the type of the offence involved. These groups include incest, sexual offences (physical or attempted physical sexual assault) and indecent exposure.

==Estonia==
The database that holds data about the criminal records of Estonian individuals is known as The Punishment Register, available for access through the Internet. It is owned and maintained by the Estonian Centre of Registers and Information Systems. Those records that are valid are made completely public. Some misdemeanour cases with the main punishment being less than 200 Euros, and cases involving minors are not published by The Punishment Register.

Since the beginning of 2012, the data providing for the criminal records of Estonian citizens is available online. Any individual with a criminal record can access the electronic version of the database to receive this information for free. In order to view information pertaining to a non-related individual, then a fixed fee must be paid to the Ministry of Justice of the Republic. The individual&#x27;s name and identification in number is also required to view their criminal record. However, there still remain some restrictions on access to this register, including protecting access to information on the criminal records of minors.

;Registering of sex offenders:

Estonia do not have a public register for sex offenders, as the Punishment Register which is available for public viewing is viewed to be sufficient by The Minister of Justice. The Minister, Hanno Pevkur, was quoted as saying:

Since 2009, the police in Estonia have the power to check up on sex offenders who have completed their punishment.

==European Union==
The European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS) is a computerised system that allows EU countries to access and exchange information regarding EU citizens&#x27; criminal convictions in an efficient way. It was implemented in April 2012.

The ECRIS was brought about in order to simplify the exchange of information relating to the criminal records of European citizens. Intended to counterbalance the relatively new ease with which individuals can move between States, it is a mechanism of ensuring that individuals are not able to escape their criminal records by merely travelling across a border. The underlying rationale is that technological advancements in transport services which have given individuals the ability to easily move between European States should not amount to an ability to expunge their own criminal records.

This is particularly important given that most domestic courts in European countries place significant weight on offenders&#x27; past convictions during criminal sentencing (for example, under s 151(1) of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 (UK)).

The EU State to which an offender is a citizen is the central repository of all criminal information relating to that offender. Accordingly, the ECRIS is not a general IT architecture that centralises all criminal information relating to all offenders. Rather, it acts as a platform that connects the central database of each State.

Developments allowing non-EU countries to utilise and contribute to the ECRIS are under current consideration.

On 24 January 2019, MEP&#x27;s agreed to close a criminal records loophole, so that going forwards national authorities will be able to quickly establish whether another EU member state holds criminal records on a non-EU citizen.

In January 2020 it was revealed by The Guardian newspaper that the UK government had failed to inform other EU member states of 75,000 convictions of foreign criminals, it then concealed the scandal to avoid damaging Britain’s reputation. &quot;“There is a nervousness from Home Office around sending the historical notifications out dating back to 2012 due to the reputational impact this could have.”&quot; from the minutes of the ACRO criminal records meeting, May 2019. This disclosure followed deliberate abuse of the Schengen Information System, and GCHQ hacking into the Belgian telecoms provider Proximus.

==Finland==
The name of the certificate of criminal record in Finland is titled: &quot;Extract from the Criminal Record and Security Clearances&quot;. In Finland there is a variety of legislation governing the use and access to criminal records, some of which include The Penal Code of Finland 1889, The Criminal Records Act 1993, Act on Background Checks 2002, and the Personal Data Act 1999 chapter 6.

Finnish criminal record checks can come in different forms by way of different types of certificates. An Extract from the Criminal Record can be applied for only by individuals. Commonly issued for those whom have regular contact with children, it contains information that is relevant to the specific type of employment. Another type of certificate which is issued for visa, work or permit applications is the Criminal Record Extract for a Visa Application. The final type of certificate is the Security Clearance Check whereby companies within the UK who have a branch office in Finland can apply for security clearance checks on prospective employees. Three levels of check are provided (limited, basic and extended). Individuals cannot apply for this certificate and certain conditions must first be met by employers before applying to the Finnish Police, including obtaining the written consent from the individual before application.

The categories of criminal conviction contained within the Extract from the Criminal Record includes those involving offences against children, sexual offences, violent offences and narcotics offences. Any other convictions not relating to these categories will not be included on the certificate. The Criminal Record Extract for a Visa Applications contains information pertaining to custodial or suspended sentences, community service, fines, juvenile punishments, and overseas decisions against Finnish citizens or permanent residents.

The length of time convictions are kept on the record varies according to type of conviction. Convictions will be removed from a criminal record after 5 years (suspended sentences, fines, and community service supplementary to a suspended sentence), 10 years (custodial sentences less than 2 years, community service) or 20 years (custodial sentences between 2–5 years). If no recent convictions have been added to an individual&#x27;s records, judgments will be removed upon death or when the individual reaches 90 years old.

There are multiple avenues in which an individual can obtain a criminal record check in Finland including applying online, by fax, post or email. An individual can also apply in person to the Legal Register Centre (Oikeusrekisterikeskus), which is the department responsible for the criminal record. The certificate, issued in English, French, German, Spanish and Swedish costs approximately €12 to €15. The certificate can be expected to be received within approximately seven working days, taking into account postage time.

As proscribed by Finnish legislation, extracts from criminal records can be transmitted to police authorities of the International Criminal Police Organization (ICPO), to police authorities, or to non-ICPO states on the grounds that it is to uphold public law, investigate and prevent criminal activity or to serve justice and social order.

==France==

===Criminal records===
The criminal records of all French citizens are maintained through an electronic register manned by the Ministry of Justice. The register is a collection of all sanctions and convictions from all penal courts since 1966 and remains the source for all aspects of criminal record disclosure in the state.

Generally speaking, the disclosure of a criminal record is only released to the individual who committed the offense and only when that individual has handed power of attorney to another or they are declared legally incompetent may another successfully apply to receive the disclosure. Perspective employers are not allowed access to disclosure at any time. Applications must be made through the Casier Judiciaire National (National Judicial Record, CJN) and are free of charge. Applications can be submitted online, via email, in person or by post of fax but are limited to the CJN. Criminal record certificates cannot be accessed through a French consulate or embassy at any time.

The three types of criminal bulletin:
* Bulletin 1 – legislatively restricted to issuance only to judicial authorities
* Bulletin 2 – restricted to French administrative authorities and various private organisations through the sanctions of the penal code
* Bulletin 3 – criminal record available only to the individual it concerns, available primarily in French but translation services can be accessed

Crimes that can be disclosed through the certificate of criminal record:
* Drug offences (possession, trafficking, attempt to sell)
* Violence against another individual (murder, attempted murder, assault)
* Sexual offences (sexual assault, sexual coercion, rape)
* Burglary and robbery
* Theft (including possession of stolen property, attempt to sell stolen goods)
* Fraud (including counts of forgery)
* Criminal damage (vandalism)
* Motoring offences and infractions

Removal of Offences from the Record
Judgements against an individual are not published on a Bulletin 3 certificate once the rehabilitation period has passed (depending on the severity of the conviction either three years for misdemeanours or five years for felony crimes, after the sentence was completed). The records of the convictions will remain on the system but will not show on the request of a record. In the case of minors, these are removed from the Bulletin 3 once the individual concerned has reached 18 years and/or three years from the date the crime was committed.

===Registering of sex offenders===
France has a sex offenders registry but unlike systems such as the United States, does not allow the public to access information regarding the information of cases and individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes, nor does France require the community to be notified of the presence of a sex offender in their neighbourhood as is obligatory in some other countries.

France in particular takes into account the need for rehabilitation as well as the need for public safety. Justice Minister Dominique Perben stated &quot;On the one hand, we must improve medical-psychiatric follow-up for these individuals and on the other hand, we must put in place a system that allows us to know where they are so we can help investigators do their jobs&quot; in response to the soaring number of convictions for sexual offences in 2002.

==Germany==
In Germany, a criminal record certificate (&quot;Führungszeugnis&quot;) is issued by the (&quot;Bundesamt für Justiz&quot;).
Germany has a criminal record system holding all the information regarding past offences and sentences. The information is maintained by the Federal Central Criminal Register (&quot;Bundeszentralregister&quot;), which is in turn subordinate to the Federal Ministry of Justice. The registry is updated daily and holds information on approximately 6.3 million individuals.

Once a person turns 14, they are able to request their own criminal record. One&#x27;s criminal record can be viewed by any member of the public at request, as long as they provide ID and purpose of the disclosure.

The information on the criminal record certificate (&quot;Führungszeugnis&quot;) includes prior offences, court citations and convictions. However, not all entries in the record system (&quot;Bundeszentralregister&quot;) are included on the certificate. Based on the severity of the committed crime and, more importantly, the sentence received, most entries are excluded from appearing on the certificate after a certain amount of time has passed (3, 5, 10 or 20 years). The time limit starts running on the day of the verdict. The only sentences exempt from this rule are life imprisonment, preventive detention and commitment in a mental hospital.

==Greece==
In Greece, criminal records are written certificates where entries are created according to the legal provisions provided for in Articles 573–580 of the Greek Code of Criminal Procedure (CCrP). An Independent Department of Criminal Records exists within the Ministry of Justice and operates as the central authority, able to supervise the criminal record system in Greece. According to provisions contained within Article 573.2 of the CCrP, records will be kept for all nationals, regardless of country of birth and even including foreigners.

Each criminal record certificate has two components: the first regarding the individuation of the person and the second consisting of the content of the person&#x27;s prior criminal acts. Every certificate must contain: information concerning the person&#x27;s identity including the paternal surname and if they are married, and the final judgement/s passed down by a court.
Specifically, Article 574.2 CCrP states that certificates must record:
* the complete listing of any irrevocable convictions issued by a court where a custodial penalty or a pecuniary sanction has been imposed;
* the complete list of any decisions sentencing a minor to confinement in an institution or educational measures;
* the complete list of convictions handed down by foreign courts, if the act committed constitutes a felony or misdemeanour according to Greek criminal law;
* the complete list of any decisions acquitting the accused due to the incapacity of the individual to stand trial because of lack of culpability or for reasons of practical repentance, given that the offence was punishable by a minimum penalty of three months&#x27; imprisonment;
* and any judicial decision suspending a custodial penalty.

These certificates of criminal records will no longer be in effect, according to Article 578, under the following conditions:
* when the person dies or is at least 80 years old;
* in cases in which a criminal offence was committed as a minor, when the minor is 17 years old;
* when the convicting order suspends the sentence and the suspension is omitted from the certificate five years after the ending of the suspension;
* if a minor has served a sentence in a correctional institution less than one year, the certificate will cease to be in effect after five years. If the sentence served exceeds one year, eight years after the completion of the sentence will the criminal act/s be struck from the record, unless a new conviction has been imposed in the meantime;
* if the judgement imposed a financial punishment or a sentence of imprisonment up to one month for an offence committed with intention, or a sentence of imprisonment for up to two months for an act committed by negligence, the criminal record ceases ten years after the sentence has been served.

In the aforementioned cases, the certificates are destroyed upon the validity of the reasons provided.

The full and detailed records of a one&#x27;s criminal past can be available to a certain range of individuals and authorities, under the terms &#x27;general use&#x27; and &#x27;judicial use&#x27;. Under Article 575, general use dictates criminal records will and can be supplied for prospective members of the Bar, future notaries and chartered accountants as they are a prerequisite for registration.

==Hong Kong==
In Hong Kong, criminal records are maintained by the Hong Kong Police Force. Unlike other countries listed on this article, Hong Kong authorities do not allow for access to criminal records by employers or school purposes. The Chief Executive of Hong Kong has the sole power to pardon offences committed in Hong Kong under section 12 of article 48 Basic Law of Hong Kong. &quot;The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall exercise the following powers and functions... To pardon persons convicted of criminal offences or commute their penalties&quot;.

===Spent records===
Criminal records are not purged regardless of time or seriousness of the case. However, under the &quot;Rehabilitation of Offenders Ordinance&quot; (HK Laws. Chap 297), a criminal record is considered &#x27;spent&#x27; if it was the first criminal offence, sentenced to less than 3 months in jail or fined less than $10,000 and a period of 3 years has elapsed since conviction and no new conviction is registered against the said person. Spent records are recorded as such with the exception to:
* Attempting to be licensed as a barrister, solicitor, accountant or insurance broker
* Applying to become a trustee or controller for Mandatory Provident Fund or a bank controller, executive or employee
* Disciplinary proceedings against any judicial officer, members of disciplined services, probation officer, employees of Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority, Office of the Commissioner of Insurance (insurance officers) and Securities and Futures Commission (executive grade only)
* Disciplinary proceedings against government officials who are paid on any Directorate or Directorate (Judicial/Legal Group) Pay Scale and those above point 27 on the Master Pay Scale

All Hong Kong residents who plan to adopt children or travel/emigrate to another country can request for a Certificate of No Criminal Conviction—a document that is issued directly to the Consulate and/or government agencies and not to the requester. Spent records do appear on such certificates with annotations that such records are spent according to Hong Kong law.

==Hungary==
A criminal database exists in Hungary which is allowed for under the 85th Act of 1999 on the criminal database and the official certificate of criminal record. There are 5 different databases, the database of offenders, the database of those under coercive measures, database of those under criminal procedures, the database of fingerprint, palm prints and photographs and the database of DNA profiles. Therefore, there is not only information recorded for those who have had a criminal sanction place against them, covered by the database of offenders, but also for those that are in pre-trial detention (database for those under coercive measures) and those who are suspected and accused of a crime (database for those under criminal procedures).
The Central Office for Administrative and Electronic Public Services (COAEPS) of the Ministry of the Interior operates, managers and maintains the databases. Investigative authorities, public prosecutors offices and criminal courts all contribute to the databases.
The amount of time a person&#x27;s information is held on these databases varies. For people imprisoned for an intentional offence, data will be removed 15 years after their release. If the offence was committed recklessly, then the data will be removed 5 years after release
The data is not publicly accessible, but a person can obtain the data held about themselves upon request.

==Indonesia==
In Indonesia, criminal record certificate exist in the form of &quot;Surat Keterangan Catatan Kepolisian (SKCK)&quot; (English: Certificate of Police Records) Issued by Indonesian National Police. This certificate state the criminal records (or the lack of it) of an individual. An individual could request the issuance of their criminal record certificate on variety of reasons. For example, in Indonesia, employers often requires job applicants to submit their police record certificate to check whether said job applicant has any criminal history or not. The certificate cost Rp 30,000 for Indonesian citizens or Rp 60,000 for foreigners to be issued (it was previously Rp 10,000 for Indonesian citizens until 2016), and valid for 6 months. After expiration date, an individual must request for a new certificate if they still need the certificate . A certificate also could only be used for one specific purpose, as the purpose of the certificate&#x27;s issuance is stated on the certificate, so individual must also request for a new one if they need a certificate for different purposes. A certificate will also be declared invalid if after the issuance, the individual in question is involved in any criminal activity.

In the past, the certificate was called &quot;Surat Keterangan Kelakuan Baik (SKKB)&quot; (English: Certificate of Good Conduct), and as the name suggest, this certificate certified the lack of criminal record of a person, thus, only a person without any criminal record could apply for an issue.

==Ireland==
The criminal record system for Ireland exists in the form an information database system which is held by the Garda Criminal Records Office as part of the Garda Síochána (the national police force). The information is owned and maintained by the Gardaí as part of their main function in tackling crime and protecting civilians.

The data held by the Gardaí is not openly available to the public. However, section 4 of the Data Protection Act allows individuals to make a formal request in writing to the Garda Criminal Records Office to access personal data held about them. In making this formal request, individuals must provide sufficient information to establish their identity and ensure that the Gardaí is both able to locate their file and make certain that the personal data is being given to the right person. Sufficient information would include: full name, correct date of birth, any other names used, current address and previous addresses in Ireland, a copy of your passport, driving licence or birth certificate and a fee of €6.35.

Additionally, a third party may also be able to access your personal data on your behalf. However, this requires that the third party satisfy the Gardaí of their identity and that the individual provides written authorization to allow the third party to make this request.

In Ireland, criminal convictions remain on the criminal record system for life if the offence was committed after the individual turned 18, as there are currently no legislative provisions which provide for the expungement of criminal convictions. Ireland remains the only country in the EU and one of the only countries in the Council of Europe area to not have such legislation.

However, under Section 258 of the Children Act 2001, offences committed by those under eighteen years of age can be expunged from the record once certain conditions are met:
where a person has been found guilty of an offence and:
* the offence was committed before they reached the age of eighteen years
* the offence is not one required to be tried by the Central Criminal Court (such as murder or rape)
* three years have elapsed since the conviction, and
* the person has not been dealt with for another offence in that three-year period
then that person will be treated as a person who has not committed or been charged with or prosecuted for or found guilty of or dealt with for that offence.

;Registering of sex offenders

There is no official sex offender registry in Ireland.
However, under the Sex Offenders Act 2001 which came into force in June 2001, an unofficial registry exists and is held centrally by the Gardaí. The location of sex offenders in Ireland is provided by a certificate issued by the court, stating that the convicted person is subject to the requirements of the Sex Offenders Act 2001 and is now obliged to provide certain information including their name and address to the Gardaí. Therefore, this certificate system is commonly referred to as the Sex Offenders Register, as it allows the details of all sex offenders subject to the requirements of the Sex Offenders Act 2001 to be held centrally by the Gardaí.

==Italy==

Italy has a criminal record system held at the Criminal Records Bureau in Rome, governed by the department of Justice. It includes convicted criminals and those awaiting trials.

Anyone who is an Italian citizen or is a non-citizen but has resided in Italy for a significant period of time can apply to see the records at the criminal records bureau or at one of their offices located in Italy. One can also apply from the UK.

The Penal Certificate includes details of all criminal offences, court hearings and outcomes.

Civil Certificate – contains information regarding bankruptcy, mental competency, and information regarding expulsion from Italy.

General Certificate – Similar to Penal Certificate but also includes any information regarding expulsion from Italy.

Information that is included includes, full name, date of birth, place of birth, reason for request, type of request.

Cost is 3.10 Euros.

The certificates are only produced in Italian.

Can someone get their record expunged?
Yes, Generally speaking, the record of an individual is expunged once the individual reaches 80 years of age or death. As the Italian system hold information regarding pending trails, once the guilty verdict is confirmed, it can take 3–10 years for their record to be expunged.

==Latvia==
Information relating to the criminal records of Latvians is held at the Information Centre of the Ministry of the Interior. The aim of this Centre – through the collection of information relating to crime – is to facilitate and investigate the most effective ways in which crime can be prevented to ensure public safety.

If a Latvian individual needs a certificate of their criminal history, they can electronically request this through www.latvija.lv. They may need this record of their criminal history to submit to employers, study overseas or enter into marriage. This record can only be obtained in person at the Ministry of Interior Information Centre or it can be received through registered mail. Therefore, information about an offender&#x27;s criminal history is not accessible to all members of the public.

In accordance with Latvian law, most criminal records are terminated after several years. The amount of time for this to occur is dependent on the nature and scope of the legal sanction for that crime. These cancelled records are still held in Information Centre records, and are readily available if the individual involved authorises the disclosure of the entire record.

==Lithuania==
On 13 September 2004, the National Register of Convictions of the Republic of Lithuania was established. The Departmental Register of Suspected, Accused and Convicted Persons is a central repository of criminal record data and related information in Lithuania. It is administered by the IT and Communications Department of the Lithuanian Ministry of the Interior which was appointed as the processing body in charge of ensuring the proper functioning and data management of the Register.

The register maintains records provided by the courts, pre-trial investigation institutions, national and local prosecution services, the prison department and the police criminal investigations centre. The Department also collects and accumulates information received from foreign countries on the convictions of Lithuania in these countries.

With the consent of the individual, the Ministry of the Interior provides individuals and third parties with two types of disclosure: a Personal Certificate, containing information about unspent convictions only; and a Personal History Statement, comprising a full criminal record disclosure (both spent and unspent convictions).

In Lithuania, judgments will be removed from the Register immediately after the completion of the sentence, depending on the seriousness of the sentence. For high-risk recidivists (10 years from completion of sentence), very serious offences (8 years), serious offences (5 years), less serious offences (3 years), suspended sentences (immediately on completion of sentence). In cases of minors, convictions incurring custodial sentences remain unspent for half the period of time stated above.

==Luxembourg==
The criminal record system in Luxembourg is maintained under the authority of the State Prosecutor General. It contains information about convictions from Luxembourg criminal courts and, under certain conditions, foreign courts.
Criminal records have two parts, Bulletin no 1 which contains the complete statement of convictions of a person living or working in Luxembourg, and Bulletin no 2 which contains all convictions with the exception of suspended criminal sentences to prison for less than six months.

For a person with a clear criminal record, access to it is free and they may access it by email or post. For those with convictions, a fee applies and should present personally to the City Criminal Court for their extract.

==Malta==
In Malta, criminal records are held by the Criminal Records Office which is maintained by the Malta Police. Individual criminal records can be obtained by requesting a Conduct Certificate from the Malta Police. Requests can be made in writing if outside the country or in person at the Malta Police Headquarters in Floriana. According to Conduct Certificate Ordinance, Chapter 77 of the Laws of Malta, a court order is required to issue a Conduct Certificate of someone other than the person which it refers to. Information contained in the Conduct certificate includes a declaration of whether the person is in good conduct or a declaration containing the convictions recorded against the person. In Malta there is provision under the Probation Act for conviction to be removed from the criminal record. Criminal records are kept for a maximum of 10 years.

Malta has recently introduced a sex offenders register. The legislation which enacted the introduction of the register is the Protection of Minors Registration Act 2012. Under the Act current and prospective employers can request information about employees contained in the register by application to the Attorney General. The application will then be heard in court. The Act states that it is a criminal offence to employ a registered person into an entity which deals with education, care, custody, welfare or upbringing of minors.

==Netherlands==
Technically spoken all Dutch people do have an empty criminal record. A criminal record (Dutch: &quot;strafblad&quot;) is stored at &quot;Justitiële Informatiedienst&quot; in Almelo. By sending an e-mail with required data, scan of individual&#x27;s passport or ID card, and paying €4.54 it is possible to have access to their own criminal record.

=== Creating and destroying a criminal record ===
A criminal record will be created after sentencing because of a violation or crime. The record will exist for 5 years in case of violations or 20 years for crimes. If the sentence is three years of imprisonment or longer, 30 years will be added at the time the criminal record will be stored. A traffic violation (according to the Mulder law) will not be stored in a criminal record, unless there will be a trial. Normally the traffic fine is given by a police officer, and the payment is generally done by banking. There will not be a trial, nor an addition in a criminal record.
In case of sexual crimes (article 240b-250) the criminal record will be destroyed after 80 years. (article 4)

=== Consequences of a criminal record ===
For a person to be eligible to join certain professions, it may required that the person not have a criminal record or to pass an ethics review based upon the nature and seriousness of any past convictions. Professions that may not be open to those with criminal records or serious convictions include legal practice, teaching, and law enforcement. A foreign national with a criminal record may be prevented from getting a visa to enter the country.

=== Declaration about Behaviour ===
Close to the opposite of a criminal record is a Declaration about Behaviour, or as the English translation on the paper itself is called: &#x27;Declaration of Conduct&#x27; (Dutch: &quot;Verklaring omtrent het Gedrag&quot; or &quot;VOG&quot;). This declaration is needed to apply for certain jobs, e.g. some government jobs, army positions, policing, or working as a security guard. The VOG will be given if the person:
* has no criminal record;
* has data in the criminal record which is irrelevant for the person who requested it. Not in all cases, because for becoming a police officer, for instance, the individual may not have any data in the record.

There is a criminal register for the Netherlands. The Netherlands took part in the Network of Judicial Registers pilot project, with 10 other countries, exchanging information on criminal records electronically.
As of 2004, the criminal record system of the Netherlands takes the form of a computerized system. This was brought about in order to reduce the manual labour associated with the previous system.

=== Public access ===
Judicial Documentation Data can be requested firstly by the individual involved. Within four weeks, the individual can be told verbally of the information included in the Judicial Documentation. The law prohibits the provision of written information. If necessary for state security purposes, the information can be refused.
Judicial data can be given to: Court officials for use in court proceedings, staff members at the office of Public Prosecutor, the Board of Procurators General, individuals and agencies not involved with criminal procedure if they serve a public function and if it serves the public interest.
Conduct Certificate is a statement by the Minister of Justice, that there are no objections to the individual in question practicing a certain profession or occupying a certain position.

=== Length of time that individuals remain in the criminal record system ===
Judicial data on criminal offences are kept for 30 years after the criminal sentence has become irrevocable. Extensions can occur for non suspended prison sentences, mental hospital orders and youth detention. Data involving Minor offences are stored until five years after the irrevocable settlement of the case – extended to ten years if the individual was sentenced to prison or community service. Eighty years after the death of the individual, all data is removed.

=== Registration of sex offenders ===
A sex offenders register under the name of ViCLAS (Violent Crime Linkage Analysis System) allows for links to be made between national and international crimes and possible offenders.
Data is not removed until 20 years after death of individual in question.

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, criminal records are administered by the Ministry of Justice. Under the Criminal Records (Clean Slate) Act 2004, records are automatically hidden from the public for less serious offences, if the individual has had no convictions for at least seven years and meets the other criteria of the act. An individual can request either their current (Clean Slate) or complete criminal record through the Ministry of Justice, or provide authorisation for a third party (e.g. employer) to view the current record. It is illegal, with some exceptions, for a third party to request a complete criminal record.

==Poland==
The Polish Ministry for Justice administers the National Criminal Register (), and it is regulated by the Act on the National Criminal Register 2000. The Act states that personal data is protected and can only be used for the public interest. Article 7(1) further states that data is only accessible to persons who fit certain criteria. Data can only be transferred to other entities, such as other law enforcement agencies, if their data protection meets the same standards, and if it is necessary for the public interest, or for the establishment of a legal claim (Article 47(4)).

As per the Act on the National Criminal Register 2000, the length of time an outcome remains on the National Criminal Register is as follows:
* Non-custodial sentences: 1 year from the date of decision
* Fines: 3 years from the date of decision
* Custodial sentences of up to 3 years: 5 years from the date of release (at the Court&#x27;s discretion)
* Custodial sentences of more than 1 month: 10 years from the date of release
The exception to this is where an individual is convicted of a sexual offence against a minor under the age of 15 years; in these circumstances, the conviction remains on the National Criminal Register permanently.

The National Criminal Register also includes information on collective entities (or publicly registered organisations).

A person can obtain a copy of their criminal history from the National Criminal Register, by contacting the central information office of the KRK in Warsaw, or information points of the KRK located within Polish common courts. In order to receive a copy of your criminal record, you must complete a form, stating the reasons for your request, and pay a fee (in July 2018: 20PLN for a digital copy, or 30PLN for a paper copy). An employer may also apply directly for disclosure in relation to a prospective employee if this is permitted under Polish laws or regulations (for example, in relation to employment in the security industry or employment involving contact with children). The written consent of the individual is not required.

The National Criminal Register Information Office provides individuals and employers with disclosure in one of two formats: as an Inquiry about an Individual (&quot;Zapytanie o udzielenie informacji o osobie&quot;) in the event that no disclosable convictions are found; or a National Criminal Register&#x27;s Information about an Individual (&quot;Informacja o osobie z Krajowego Rejestru Karnego&quot;) in the event that disclosable information exists.

Poland also participated in the pilot project for &#x27;Network of Judicial Registers&#x27;, along with ten other EU member states, for the electronic exchange of criminal records among member states.

==Portugal==
Portugal&#x27;s criminal record system is an electronic database manned and maintained by Portugal&#x27;s Direcção Geral da Administração da Justiça (General Direction for the Administration of Justice, DGAJ).
The system contains the records of Portuguese citizens that reside in Portugal, Portuguese nationals that live abroad and any foreign citizens that reside within Portugal.
Disclosure of an individual&#x27;s criminal record is allowed at the request of the individual; themselves, or a third party with written consent of the individual. For example, an employer may request to see their possible employee&#x27;s criminal record with their consent. However, the application must be made in person. The certificate regarding criminal records in Portugal is called a &quot;certificado do registo criminal&quot; (certificate of criminal registration) which conveys whether an individual has a criminal record. An extension of this is a more detailed certificate regarding an individual&#x27;s criminal activities which provides evidence for an individual to be employed in a job where they have access to large sums of cash, need high security clearance or supervise children. This particular certificate is granted in a similar way to Australia&#x27;s Working With Children Check, which supplies an employer with information regarding any previous criminal activity and ensures that convicted criminals are not employed in the same areas where they may have previously committed crimes. Applications for the certificates can be made through several channels, there is a central repository for criminal records located in Lisbon, alongside a vast selection of regional courts and their administration services throughout Portugal that can provide individuals with certificates and for Portuguese nationals residing overseas, applications can be made through embassies and consulates. However, none of the channels through which the certificates are available provide translation services, and therefore the certificate produced is always written in Portuguese, even when produced by an embassy in a non-Portuguese-speaking state.

The types of criminal convictions that can be exposed through the publishing of the certificate are very similar to that of the United Kingdom and are presented below:
* Drug offences (possession, trafficking, attempt to sell)
* Violence against another individual (murder, attempted murder, assault)
* Sexual offences (sexual assault, sexual coercion, rape)
* Burglary and robbery
* Theft (including possession of stolen property, attempt to sell stolen goods)
* Fraud (including counts of forgery)
* Criminal damage (vandalism)

Portuguese legislation allows for all criminal convictions to be removed from an individual&#x27;s record once the rehabilitation period has passed. It is determined as follows:
* Custodial sentences of up to 5 years – 5 years from the date of release
* Custodial sentences of between 5 and 8 years – 7 years from the date of release
* Custodial sentences of over 8 years – 10 years from the date of release
* Reprimands and warnings – 5 years from the date of decision
Essentially this legislation allows individuals to move on from their convictions and ensure that they are not socially and economically disadvantaged for the rest of their lives after serving their crimes. However, the governing legislation is only available in Portuguese.

A very contentious aspect of this legislation is that those that commit heinous, sexually based crimes have their records expunged on the same time frame as all other individuals convicted. This legislation issue was brought into the spotlight during the 2007 media coverage of the Madeleine McCann case.

==Romania==
Law No 290 governs the disclosure of criminal records in Romania. The criminal records of all Romanian citizens are kept in a Central Criminal Records database by the General Inspectorate of the Romanian Police. Police stations gather and keep the records of conviction status of individuals born in Romania, and it is their responsibility to keep these records up-to-date. This type of criminal record disclosure is named the Criminal Records Certificate. These Certificates contain personal information including full name, unique identification number, date and place of birth, most recent address, name of parents, and the details of the committed offence, rehabilitation and extradition information.

To obtain access to a criminal record, an individual must apply directly to the local county police station in person. If the application is approved, results are issued in the form of a Criminal Records Certificate by the Central Inspectorate of the Romanian Police. Only the individual person is allowed to apply for their own record; however, a third-party individual may submit an application only if they have been authorised power of attorney. Judgements are able to be removed from an individual&#x27;s criminal record if the legislation decriminalising the act for which the person has been sentenced is passed, in the event of amnesty or court rehabilitation, and for imprisonment of up to 3 years after 20 years from the date of the final decision.

==Russia==
Individuals in Russia can obtain a national criminal history to check themselves, and this certificate is required for individuals seeking education employment: certain offences ban individual from such job. The certificate is issued by Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for free within one month after application submitted via official Public Services Portal or in person. Certificate also can be in electronic form with digital signature or on paper.

==Slovakia==
There is a centralised criminal record system, there is only one centralised database where the final criminal conviction issued by a Slovak criminal court is registered. This database is in electronic form and is maintained a unit within the General Prosecutors office of the Slovak Republic. The relevant legislation for this is governed by the Act on Criminal Records.
As of 2008 there was a proposed bill that these criminal records could only be accessed by request to the General Prosecutors office when the person in question was up for a position which required a clean criminal record. Certain criminal records are not accessible at any time for instance the criminal record/record details of the President of the Republic of Slovakia are not available to anyone during his/her time in office.
The criminal records and personal details of everyone held by the General Prosecutors office are lifelong, and continue to be updated throughout their life, every time they move address/change name etc.

==Slovenia==
Criminal record information in Slovenia is looked after by the Department for Criminal Records and Educational Measures (DCREM), this is based at the Ministry of Justice. Among other things the DCREM maintains a database which holds information on convicted criminals.

Although this database is not public, applications for a criminal records disclosure can be made to the DCREM, anyone who has lived in Slovenia for a significant amount of time may apply for the disclosure of a particular criminal record. Although perspective employers cannot request a copy directly from the DCREM, they must request this from the perspective employee.
The time in which a conviction remains on a person&#x27;s criminal record depends on the type of conviction received, i.e. The longer the prison sentence served the longer the conviction remains on the record, up to 15 years. If a conviction is 15 years&#x27; imprisonment this shall never be removed from the criminal record. However, if the conviction is removed, then all rights are given back to the person in question, as if the conviction had never been received at all.

The driving license of those who reject the sobriety test may be revoked permanently, and their revocation stays in records indefinitely. At the European Court of Human Rights, there is currently a case pending which aims at the ruling that permanent keeping of the records is excessive.

==Spain==
The criminal record system for Spain exists in the form of the &quot;Central Criminal Records Registry&quot; (&quot;Registro Central de Penados&quot;). It contains convictions for all crimes and also for misdemeanors.

The Central Criminal Records Registry is not publicly accessible and therefore very few public agencies and no private agencies have access to it. This has been confirmed by the New Penal Code (1995) Art.136.4. Therefore, the Central Criminal Records Registry is only accessible to judges, public prosecutors and the judicial police for investigative purposes. Other cases where direct access can be granted include: Guardia Civil for gun permits and border control police. Besides judges, prosecutors and some police agencies, only the recorded subject may request a copy of their personal Conviction Record.

In Spain, conviction records are not &#x27;expunged&#x27; as they are not erased completely but rather are &#x27;cancelled&#x27; in a process known as &#x27;cancelling a conviction record&#x27;. Therefore, judges will still be aware of the records but they disregarded as an aggravating factor when sentencing. Once conviction records are cancelled, the individual will possess a clean criminal record. Therefore, the record of their convictions will be sealed in the Central Criminal Records Registry and is likely made unavailable to the police.

To cancel a conviction record the following requirements under Penal Code 47 (art.136.2) must be met: 1) A period of time after having served the sentence must have elapsed (6 months, 2 years, 3 years or 5 years depending on the sentence); 2) no further crime has been committed in the interim; 3) civil compensation has been paid or the person has been declared without money. To cancel a criminal record, the individual either makes a free of charge formal request to the Ministry of Justice or the Central Criminal Records Registry cancels the record itself.

==Sweden==
In Sweden, the police have a record of convictions (&quot;Belastningsregistret&quot;). It does not contain arrests, and its information is not available for general public, even regarding serious crimes. Individuals can ask for a copy of their own record once per year, or for a fee anytime. For employment involving children or for security guards etc., a check will be made against the criminal record. Regular employers more and more often require applicants to get a record copy themselves and give the employer. The number of requests for own copies increased from 40,000 to 199,000 between 2003 and 2012.

Sweden is one of the countries with the largest databases of criminal records, containing some of the oldest population statistics in the world. In the past, individuals were prohibited from retrieving information about themselves to prevent being forced by employers or landlords to hand over the information. Yet there have been two notable changes in Swedish regulation of criminal records. In 1989, access was given to employers with the implementation of the &#x27;subject access&#x27; paragraph in Swedish criminal records legislation. In 2001, it became mandatory for employers to check criminal records of teachers and childcare workers before they were hired, given the seriousness of sex offences against children. Individuals&#x27; criminal history records are today more available to the public than ever before.

The Swedish Criminal Records Registry is administered by the Swedish National Police Board which regulates access to criminal records and the use of criminal background checks by employers. The registry contains information on those who have been sentenced in criminal courts or summarily imposed a fine, who have had a restraining order issued against them, or in whose cases prosecution had been abstained from. Generally, the information is kept for five years if the offence was punishable by fine, and ten years if it called for other sentences and sanctions. For those aged under 18 at the time the crime was committed, information is kept for only three or five years depending on the type of punishment.

In January 2014, Swedish criminal records became available online with the launch of a new website Lexbase. People can search for their friends&#x27;, colleagues&#x27; and neighbours&#x27; criminal records, showing the location of convicted criminals in the past five years in their neighbourhood by plotting red dots on the map. The user is able to then pay a fee to get more information about the crime committed. Lexbase has become the subject of intense criticism from Swedish media, government and the general public, given its alleged infringement on the right to privacy and increased social alienation of offenders.

==Switzerland==
The &quot;Strafregister&quot; is run by the Federal Department of Justice and Police. It lists final judgments in case of:
* felonies (offences that are punishable by imprisonment for more than three years)
* misdemeanors (offences that are punishable by imprisonment for up to three years or monetary penalty)
* infractions, if a fine exceeding 5000 Swiss francs or community service of more than 180 hours has been imposed
* certain infractions against road traffic regulations (serious speeding, driving with a blood alcohol content of more than 0.08%)
* court-ordered psychiatric treatments
* any judgment involving prohibitions (for example driving vehicles, working in certain professions, taking part in activities, contacting persons or the obligation not to enter certain defined areas).

When the prosecutor decides not to refer the matter to a court, or if the court has acquitted the defendant, there will be no criminal record.

Crimes committed by Swiss citizens abroad will also result in a Swiss criminal record, as soon as Swiss authorities have been informed and the sentences are comparable.

As of 28 February 2022, the &quot;Strafregister&quot; contains 1&#x27;154&#x27;055 sentences against 796&#x27;605 persons.

The full criminal record can be requested by anybody, as long as the person involved has given written authority to do so. Other than that, state authorities like courts, migration and naturalization authorities, the Federal Office of Civil Aviation and road traffic authorities can request the record without approval.

=== Expunging records ===
Criminal records will be expunged after a period of 10, 15 or 20 years plus the duration of the prison sentence handed down in the judgment, depending on the length of the sentence. In case a prisoner is released early, on parole, the period will commence on the day the prisoner would have been regularly released.

In all other cases, the record will be expunged after ten years. If somebody has been sentenced to a period of probation, the record will only appear until the end of successful probation. When a non-official requests the criminal record as a &quot;Privatauszug&quot; (private excerpt), the sentences will only appear for ⅔ of the mentioned time spans. When somebody has been expelled from Switzerland, the expulsion notice is never stricken from the record. If a minor has been sentenced under the &quot;Jugendstrafrecht&quot; (youth penal code, affecting 10 to 18 years old persons), the &quot;Privatauszug&quot; only shows the sentences if the person has re-offended as an adult.

=== Special private excerpt ===
The &quot;Sonderprivatauszug&quot; (special private excerpt) can be requested to prove that there is no ongoing ban on activities that involve minors (e.g. teaching, sport training) or vulnerable persons (e.g. treating and nursing patients). The employer must confirm the (intended) employment of the person in question before the special private excerpt is requested. This different excerpt is necessary because the usual &quot;Privatauszug&quot; could be empty while a prohibition is still active, for example when it has been set for a lifetime in case of certain serious crimes.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, checks on a person&#x27;s criminal record are undertaken by the Disclosure and Barring Service (in England and Wales), Disclosure Scotland (Scotland and basic Disclosure for all the UK) and Access Northern Ireland, all of which have partial access to the Police National Computer (PNC) which holds the definitive record.

In England and Wales, a PNC record is held for 100 years. The PNC has the ability to record youth reprimands, youth final warnings, cautions and convictions. In 2006 Scotland opted out of retaining records indefinitely. In Scotland, non-convictions are held for 2 years whereas convictions are held for 20 or 30 years depending on the seriousness of the crime.

The police also utilize the Police national Database which is a depositary of locally held records. Locally held records may involve non-guilty verdicts, known associates, being a suspect in a report, drug intelligence on vehicles. Most information held on the PND is deleted after 7 years. The PND may be used to add other relevant information onto an enhanced DBS check.

The Home Office is currently working to introduce the Law Enforcement Data Service (LEDS), which will replace the PNC. All records from PNC and PND will migrate to the new system.

The ACPO criminal records office was founded in 2006, and it has the role of managing criminal record information and improving links between criminal records and biometric information.

These records are not publicly accessible and cannot be viewed without the subject&#x27;s consent, although in some cases an employer might make such consent a condition of employment, especially if the employee is to work with children or other vulnerable people. The child sex offenders disclosure scheme allows parents and guardians to ask the police if someone with access to a child has a record for child sexual offences.

Information supplied depends on the level of disclosure required. Low-level disclosures only reveal unspent convictions (convictions which have not yet been expunged under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974), while enhanced disclosures normally include &quot;all&quot; convictions, cautions, reprimands and final warnings. An enhanced criminal record certificate may contain relevant information that need not relate solely to criminal matters.

Arrests that do not lead to an official finding of guilt, i.e. a conviction or the acceptance of a caution, are &quot;not&quot; considered part of a person&#x27;s criminal record and are not typically disclosed as part of the process. However, an enhanced disclosure may include such additional information, which is supplied at the Chief Constable&#x27;s discretion. Enhanced disclosures are typically used to screen applicants for positions such as police officer, social worker, and teacher, which involve contact with vulnerable groups and children.

Individuals and the self-employed cannot apply for a DBS check of their own criminal record, as they cannot ask an exempted question (a valid request for a person to reveal their full criminal history, including spent convictions) of themselves.

Only organisations registered with the DBS can ask an exempted question and submit applications for criminal records checks. There are two types of registered organisation: a registered body, which is the employer; and an umbrella body, a registered body that processes criminal record checks for non-registered organisations who can ask the exempted question.

=== Effect on recidivism ===
The Lammy Review found that a criminal record that is visible to potential employers is a significant detriment to a person&#x27;s future work prospects, and that work is key to reducing re-offending. Therefore having a criminal record that is visible to employers can increase the likelihood for a criminal to re-offend. The review also found that BAME groups are disproportionately affected as they are already more likely to be discriminated in employment.

==United States==

In the United States, criminal records are compiled and updated on local, state, and federal levels by various law enforcement agencies. The primary purpose of a criminal record is to present a comprehensive criminal history for an individual.

Criminal histories are maintained by law enforcement agencies in all levels of government. Local police departments, sheriffs&#x27; offices, and specialty police agencies may maintain their own internal databases. On the state level, state police, troopers, highway patrol, correctional agencies, and other law enforcement agencies also maintain separate databases. Law enforcement agencies often share this information with other similar enforcement agencies and this information is usually made available to the public.

All states have official &quot;statewide repositories&quot; of criminal history information that include information contributed by the various county and municipal courts and law enforcement agencies within the state. State repositories are usually accurate, but all states have provisions for the correction of errors that occur in the reporting and recording of criminal history information. Individuals may normally obtain their own records from the state, but to obtain the records of another person, a private individual will normally need to obtain a release from the subject of the record search.

The federal government maintains extensive criminal histories and acts as a central repository for all agencies to report their own data. The Next Generation Identification (NGI) System is a database of criminal history information that is maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Acting within the NGI System the Interstate Identification Index (III) System maintains a system of state pointers that provide a gateway to the state that maintains administrative control of that arrest information. The FBI maintains administrative control for the federal agencies. When a criminal history record is requested, then the appropriate agency responds with their criminal history record for that subject.

===Use and usage controversy===
Criminal records may be used for many purposes, mostly for background checks, including identification, employment, security clearance, adoption, immigration/international travel/visa, licensing, assistance in developing suspects in an ongoing criminal investigation, and for enhanced sentencing in criminal prosecutions.

In the 21st century, there has been controversy about for-profit data mining companies that harvest much of the electronic booking blotter records from various police authorities nationwide and offer it for free on the public Internet and for sale to employers. Though frequently effective at identifying applicants with criminal backgrounds, the mined data does not usually reflect subsequent results of any criminal prosecution, acquittal, or dismissal of charges, and the highly prejudicial nature of such records can damage applicant chances for jobs and other benefits when such records are not in proper context of subsequent prosecutorial result for a hiring manager or recruiter to evaluate. In many cases, records are available for seven years or more beyond acquittals or dismissal of charges. In addition, since arrest records can sometimes be mistakenly matched to individuals with the same or similar names, the prejudicial nature of the available records, particularly violent ones, can negatively affect applicants and candidates in a dramatic way when they otherwise have no actual criminal record.

===Expungement===
In the United States, a conviction can be expunged, although the laws vary from state to state. Although in most states people with an expunged record may deny having a conviction, they may have to nonetheless inform certain prospective employers or government agencies of an expunged conviction.

<text>Peter Hayden Dinklage (; born June 11, 1969) is an American actor. Portraying Tyrion Lannister on the HBO television series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; (2011–2019), Dinklage won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series a record four times. He also received a Golden Globe Award in 2011 and a Screen Actors Guild Award in 2020 for the role. Dinklage has a common form of dwarfism known as achondroplasia, and stands tall. He has used his celebrity status to raise social awareness of dwarfism.

Dinklage studied acting at Bennington College, performing in a number of amateur stage productions. He made his film debut in the black comedy film &quot;Living in Oblivion&quot; (1995), and had his breakthrough with a starring role in the 2003 comedy-drama &quot;The Station Agent&quot;. His other films include &quot;Elf&quot; (2003), &quot;Lassie&quot; and &quot;The Baxter&quot; (both in 2005), &quot;Find Me Guilty&quot; (2006), &quot;Penelope&quot; (2006), &quot;Death at a Funeral&quot; (2007), &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian&quot; (2008), &quot;Death at a Funeral&quot; (2010), &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; (2014), &quot;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&quot; (2017), &quot;The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes&quot; (2023), and &quot;Wicked&quot; (2024). In 2018, he appeared as Eitri in the Marvel film &quot;&quot;, and as Hervé Villechaize in the biopic film &quot;My Dinner with Hervé&quot;. He also provided voice-acting for the video game &quot;Destiny&quot;, and in 2023, he voiced Scourge in &quot;&quot;.

Dinklage has also performed in theater, with roles including the title character in &quot;Richard III&quot; (2003) at the Public Theatre, Rakitin in &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; (2015) at Classic Stage Company, and Cyrano de Bergerac in &quot;Cyrano&quot; at the Daryl Roth Theatre in 2019.

== Early life ==
Dinklage was born on June 11, 1969, in the Jersey Shore region of New Jersey, to John Carl Dinklage, an insurance salesman, and Diane Dinklage, an elementary school music teacher of German and Irish descent. He grew up in the historic Brookside section of Mendham Township, with his parents and older brother Jonathan. He is the only member of his family with achondroplasia. He was raised Catholic. 

As a child, Dinklage and his brother performed puppet musicals for people in their neighborhood. He has described his brother Jonathan as &quot;the real performer of the family&quot;, saying that his brother&#x27;s passion for the violin was the only thing that kept him from pursuing acting. Jonathan graduated from the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University-New Brunswick and served as violinist and concertmaster for the musical &quot;Hamilton&quot;.

Dinklage had his first theatrical success in a fifth-grade production of &quot;The Velveteen Rabbit&quot;. Playing the lead, he was delighted by the audience&#x27;s response to the show. He attended Delbarton School, a Catholic preparatory school for boys, where he developed his acting skills. In 1984, he was inspired to pursue an acting career by a production of Sam Shepard&#x27;s play &quot;True West&quot;.

He attended Bennington College, where he studied for a drama degree and appeared in numerous productions before graduating in 1991. He moved to New York City with his friend Ian Bell to build a theater company; failing to pay the rent, they had to move out of their apartment. He subsequently lived in New York for 20 years in Williamsburg and the West Village, then worked six years for a data-processing company before again pursuing a full-time acting career.

== Career ==
=== Early career (1995–2002) ===
Dinklage initially struggled to find acting work, partially because he refused to take the roles typically offered to actors with his condition, such as &quot;elves or leprechauns&quot;.
He had a credited film debut in the low-budget independent comedy-drama &quot;Living in Oblivion&quot; (1995), where he starred alongside Steve Buscemi. It tells the story of a director, crew, and cast filming a low-budget independent film in New York City. Dinklage&#x27;s role was that of a frustrated actor with dwarfism who complains about his clichéd roles. The next year, he appeared as a building manager in the crime drama &quot;Bullet&quot; starring rapper Tupac Shakur. Even after his well-received performance in &quot;Living in Oblivion&quot;, Dinklage could not find someone willing to be his agent. After a recommendation from Buscemi to director Alexandre Rockwell, Dinklage was cast in the comedy &quot;13 Moons&quot; (2002). When later interviewed for a theater website, he was asked what his ideal role was, and he replied &quot;to play the romantic lead and get the girl.&quot;

=== Breakthrough (2003–2010) ===

Dinklage found his breakthrough playing Finbar McBride, who is a quiet, withdrawn, unmarried man in the 2003 Tom McCarthy-directed film &quot;The Station Agent&quot;. According to co-star Bobby Cannavale, the film took three years to make and was not at first written with Dinklage in mind. Cannavale said McCarthy &quot;set out to tell a story about a guy who was a train enthusiast who had chosen to isolate himself from the world,&quot; but when McCarthy actually started &quot;putting pen to paper&quot; for the screenplay, he decided to write the role for him. Speaking about the role, Dinklage noted that usually &quot;roles written for someone my size are a little flat&quot;—often either comical or &quot;sort of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;&quot; type characters filled with wisdom; further: &quot;They&#x27;re not sexual, they&#x27;re not romantic&quot; and &quot;they&#x27;re not flawed.&quot; What attracted him to the character McCarthy had written was that it was not one of the stereotypical roles people with dwarfism play; rather, McBride has &quot;romantic feelings&quot; as well as &quot;anger and ... flaws.&quot; The role earned him the Independent Spirit Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor nominations. In the &quot;New York Observer&quot;, reviewer Andrew Sarris wrote, &quot;Dinklage projects both size and intelligence in the fascinating reticence of his face.&quot; Besides being Dinklage&#x27;s highest-rated film on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Station Agent&quot; was modestly successful at the box office, earning over $8 million against its small budget.

Dinklage later appeared in the direct-to-DVD film &quot;Tiptoes&quot; (2003) with Gary Oldman and Matthew McConaughey. The film met with negative reviews, particularly Oldman&#x27;s role as a person with dwarfism. According to Dinklage, the original cut of the film was &quot;gorgeous,&quot; but the director was fired shortly after turning it in, and the film was re-cut into a &quot;rom-com with dwarfs.&quot; Speaking on the Oldman controversy, Dinklage said, &quot;There was some flak: &#x27;Why would you put Gary Oldman on his knees? That&#x27;s almost like blackface.&#x27; And I have my own opinions about political correctness, but I was just like, It&#x27;s Gary Oldman. He can do whatever he wants, and I&#x27;m so happy to be here.&quot;

That year, Dinklage also starred in several off-Broadway productions, such as &quot;Richard III&quot;. Dinklage appeared in the Christmas comedy film &quot;Elf&quot; as Miles Finch, an irritable children&#x27;s author who beats up Buddy Hobbs (Will Ferrell) after he mistakes him for an elf. In 2005, he starred in the short-lived CBS science fiction series &quot;Threshold&quot; and appeared as a wedding planner in the comedy film &quot;The Baxter&quot;. He also made an appearance in the adventure comedy-drama &quot;Lassie&quot; as a traveling circus performer.

In 2006, Dinklage co-starred with Vin Diesel in &quot;Find Me Guilty&quot;, a courtroom drama directed by Sidney Lumet. The film tells the true story of the longest Mafia trial in American history; Dinklage played Ben Klandis, the lead defense attorney. Critical reaction to the film was mostly positive, though it was a commercial failure. Writing for &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, film critic Roger Ebert praised Dinklage&#x27;s performance, saying that the character he plays stands apart as &quot;concise, articulate and professional.&quot; The same year, he portrayed the character Marlowe Sawyer in episodes of &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;. He played a fictionalized version of himself in an episode of the HBO series &quot;Entourage&quot; and appeared in NBC&#x27;s &quot;30 Rock&quot; as Stewart. The same year, Dinklage appeared in the British romantic comedy &quot;Penelope&quot; playing Lemon, a tabloid reporter. The film received mixed reviews from critics.

Dinklage appeared in the 2007 British comedy film &quot;Death at a Funeral&quot;, reprising the role in the 2010 American remake. Later in 2007, he played the villainous Simon Bar Sinister in &quot;Underdog&quot;, which was poorly received, but had some commercial success.

Dinklage played Trumpkin in the 2008 film &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian&quot;. The film was considered a box office disappointment compared to the first installment, with global revenues of $419.7 million, and film critic Bill Gibron described Dinklage&#x27;s role as a &quot;cutesy stereotype he has tried to avoid.&quot; Later that year, he played the title role in &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (directed by his wife, Erica Schmidt) in Bard College&#x27;s annual Bard SummerScape, the Upstate New York summer stage on the Annandale-on-Hudson campus. In 2010, he appeared in the Australian movie &quot;I Love You Too&quot; alongside Brendan Cowell and Peter Helliar.

=== Mainstream and critical success (2011–present) ===
====&quot;Game of Thrones&quot;====
Between 2011 and 2019, Dinklage portrayed Tyrion Lannister in HBO&#x27;s fantasy drama &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, an adaptation of author George R. R. Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; novels. &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; takes place on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos and chronicles the power struggles among noble families as they fight for control of the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion is a member of House Lannister, one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in Westeros, and uses his status as a Lannister to mitigate the impact of the marginalization and derision he has received all of his life.

In May 2009, he was the first actor to be cast. Showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss noted that Dinklage, whom they described as funny, smart and witty, was their first choice for the role, as the actor&#x27;s &quot;core of humanity, covered by a shell of sardonic dry wit, is pretty well in keeping with the character.&quot;

Unfamiliar with the source material, Dinklage was cautious in his first meeting with the producers; as a dwarf, &quot;he wouldn&#x27;t play elves or leprechauns&quot; and was choosy about genre roles. Benioff and Weiss told Dinklage that the character was &quot;a different kind of fantasy little person,&quot; or in the actor&#x27;s words, &quot;No beard, no pointy shoes, a romantic, real human being.&quot; Dinklage signed on to play Tyrion before the meeting was half over, in part because, he said, &quot;They told me how popular he was.&quot; Martin said of Dinklage&#x27;s casting, &quot;If he hadn&#x27;t accepted the part, oh, boy, I don&#x27;t know what we would have done.&quot; The series proved to be a commercial success; it was renewed for multiple seasons and concluded with its eighth season in May 2019.

Dinklage received widespread critical praise for his performance. Matthew Gilbert from &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; said that Dinklage &quot;gives a winning performance that is charming, morally ambiguous, and self-aware.&quot; Dan Kois of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that Dinklage&#x27;s performance has made the character &quot;all the more popular.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote &quot;In many ways, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; belongs to Dinklage.&quot; &quot;HuffPost&quot; called Tyrion the &quot;most quotable&quot; character and &quot;one of the most beloved characters&quot; of the series.

For his performance, he went on to win the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2011, 2015, 2018, and 2019, as well as the 2012 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. As a result of his performance and increased screen time, Dinklage was given top billing starting in the series&#x27; second season. In 2014, he said on &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot; that he had once tried to read the books the show is based upon, but had found them confusing. He joked, &quot;George Martin, our author, is probably going to kill my character soon because I mentioned that.&quot; In 2014, Dinklage and four of his &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; co-stars became some of the highest paid actors on television, although sources differ on the actors&#x27; per-episode salaries. In 2015, Dinklage lent his voice for the role of Tyrion in &quot;Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series&quot;, a video game based on the show.

====Other performances====
In 2011, Dinklage appeared opposite Kate Hudson in Nicole Kassell&#x27;s &quot;A Little Bit of Heaven&quot;. The following year, Dinklage voiced Captain Gutt in &quot;Ice Age: Continental Drift.&quot; Dinklage said he prepared himself by making sure to rest his voice before the recording sessions as it was his first voice acting role, and that he prefers doing roles he has not done before. After appearing in an episode of NBC&#x27;s late-night sketch comedy &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 2013, Dinklage hosted an episode of the show in April 2016; his appearances included a sketch of him and Gwen Stefani singing a new song called &quot;Space Pants.&quot; He received praise for his performance.

In 2014, Dinklage starred in the comedy horror film &quot;Knights of Badassdom&quot; opposite Ryan Kwanten and Steve Zahn. The film is about three best friends that go to the woods and reenact a live action &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role play, when they mistakenly conjure up a demon from Hell. The same year, he played the villain Bolivar Trask in the superhero film &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot;. In preparation for his role, Dinklage stated that he did not want to approach the character necessarily as a villain, saying that Trask &quot;actually sees what he&#x27;s doing as a good thing.&quot; He also voiced the AI Ghost in the 2014 video game &quot;Destiny&quot;, but was replaced by Nolan North in August 2015. Executive producer Mark Noseworthy said that it was due to scheduling difficulties caused by Dinklage&#x27;s other acting commitments.

In 2015, Dinklage starred in the science fiction comedy film &quot;Pixels&quot; as a former arcade champion named Eddie Plant. According to director Chris Columbus, Plant was partially inspired by Billy Mitchell. The film was critically panned. &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised Dinklage&#x27;s performance in an otherwise &quot;dreary romp&quot;.

In 2016, Dinklage provided the voice of The Mighty Eagle in &quot;The Angry Birds Movie&quot;, and recorded a song for the musical&#x27;s soundtrack.

His next release, the independent film &quot;Rememory&quot; (2017), failed to impress reviewers, but his role of Sam Bloom was praised. Freelance film critic Yasmin Kleinbart stated that &quot;Dinklage deserves better than this film&quot; and John DeFore in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said that he &quot;delivers a soulful lead performance that will attract fans&#x27; attention.&quot; Also in 2017, Dinklage had a supporting role in the drama-dark comedy film &quot;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&quot;, from director Martin McDonagh, and the drama &quot;Three Christs&quot;, both of which played at the Toronto International Film Festival, with the former receiving widespread critical success. In 2018, Dinklage produced and starred in &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot;, a post-apocalyptic drama based on the companionship between Del, played by Dinklage, and Grace, played by Elle Fanning. The film premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival, and was later released to theaters on September 14, 2018.

In 2016, Dinklage and his longtime manager David Ginsburg founded their joint-venture production company, Estuary Films. &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot; is the first film under Estuary.

Dinklage appeared in the 2018 Marvel Studios film &quot;&quot; as the character Eitri, a giant dwarf.

Dinklage and writer-director Sacha Gervasi spent several years writing and producing a film based on the final days of actor Hervé Villechaize, who died by suicide shortly after his 1993 interview with Gervasi. In 2018, Dinklage starred and played the title role in &quot;My Dinner with Hervé&quot;. The movie was approved by HBO, with Dinklage co-starring alongside Jamie Dornan.

In August and September 2018, he starred in the title role of &quot;Cyrano&quot;, a stage musical adaptation of &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; written by his wife Erica Schmidt, with songs by the band The National. He reprised the role in a 2021 film adaptation of the musical, for which he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy.

In 2019, Dinklage was announced he would co-star in the comedy film &quot;Brothers,&quot; alongside Josh Brolin. The film, directed by Max Barbakow with a screenplay by Macon Blair from a story by Etan Cohen, was released in October 2024.

In 2020, Dinklage portrayed the pirate Fannybaws in the music video of the same name from Scottish power metal band Alestorm.

In 2020, Dinklage portrayed mobster Roman Lunyov in the crime thriller &quot;I Care a Lot&quot;. His performance was praised, with Tony Sokol favorably comparing his character to Russian mobsters in other media, including &quot;Training Day&quot; and &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot;.

In 2023, Dinklage voiced Terrorcon Scourge, the main antagonist in &quot;&quot;. He also starred in the romantic comedy-drama film &quot;She Came to Me&quot;, and played Casca Highbottom in the film &quot;The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes&quot;. In 2024, Dinklage was announced to voice Dr. Dillamond in the two-part film adaptation of the musical, &quot;Wicked,&quot; alongside a cast including Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. In 2024, Dinklage had a cameo in Jerry Seinfeld&#x27;s &quot;Unfrosted&quot;, which premiered on Netflix.

On October 5, 2017, Dinklage purchased the rights to the film adaptation of Joe R. Lansdale&#x27;s novel &quot;The Thicket&quot;. The film, &quot;The Thicket&quot;, which stars Dinklage alongside Juliette Lewis and Esme Creed-Miles, was released in September 2024.

In 2024, Dinklage voiced Hitpig in the animated film &quot;Hitpig!,&quot; alongside Ru Paul, Hannah Gadsby and Lily Singh. Dinklage will voice Hercule Poirot in an upcoming Audible adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 2005, Dinklage married Erica Schmidt, a theater director. They have two children: a daughter born in 2011 and a son born in 2017. They primarily reside in Greenwich Village, Manhattan and have a property in Upstate New York.

Dinklage&#x27;s face was injured in the early 1990s when he was in a &quot;punk-funk-rap&quot; band called Whizzy. He was playing at the nightclub CBGB in New York City, when he was accidentally kneed in the face and started bleeding on the stage. It gave him a scar that runs from his neck to his eyebrow.

In 2008, Dinklage described himself as a lapsed Catholic. 

Dinklage became a vegetarian at the age of 16. In a 2024 episode of the podcast &quot;Flagrant&quot; he stated he started eating fish and chicken again, while filming &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; in Croatia as he became fatigued on set, although he does not eat red meat. He supports Farm Sanctuary and has been the group&#x27;s spokesperson for its Walk for Farm Animals. He appeared in a PETA campaign, asking &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; fans to adopt pets from shelters rather than buying huskies that might look like direwolves. 

In 2017, Dinklage attended the Women&#x27;s March demonstration in Park City, Utah to advocate legislation and policies regarding human rights and other issues. 

===Dwarfism===
Dinklage has achondroplasia, a genetic disorder which affects bone growth. As a result, he is tall, with an average-sized head and torso but shorter than average limbs. He has come to accept his condition, but sometimes found it challenging when growing up. In 2003, he said that when he was younger he was often angry and bitter, but that as he got older, he realized he &quot;just [has] to have a sense of humor&quot; to know &quot;that it&#x27;s not your problem. It&#x27;s theirs.&quot;

When asked in 2012 whether he saw himself as &quot;a spokesman for the rights of little people,&quot; Dinklage said: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what I would say. Everyone&#x27;s different. Every person my size has a different life, a different history. Different ways of dealing with it. Just because I&#x27;m seemingly okay with it, I can&#x27;t preach how to be okay with it.&quot; He has nonetheless been viewed as a role model for people sharing his condition.

At the 2012 Golden Globe ceremony, when Dinklage won the award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film, he told the audience that he had been thinking about &quot;a gentleman, his name is Martin Henderson&quot;, and suggested that they Google his name. Henderson was a man with dwarfism from Somerset, England, who was badly injured after being tossed by a rugby fan in a bar. Dinklage&#x27;s words brought media and public attention to the act of dwarf-tossing, with Henderson&#x27;s name being trended worldwide on social media. Henderson eventually died of his injuries in 2016, five years after the incident. Dinklage turned down offers from talk shows to discuss the topic. He later explained that 20 years earlier he might have accepted the offers, but that he was &quot;a little bit more at peace with things now&quot;, and &quot;I said what I wanted to say… I have a friend who says the world doesn&#x27;t need another angry dwarf.&quot;

In January 2022, Dinklage appeared on an episode of the &quot;WTF with Marc Maron&quot; podcast, where he criticized Disney&#x27;s portrayal of the Seven Dwarfs in the upcoming live-action remake of the 1937 animated film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. He said that although Disney tried to be progressive by casting a Latina actress as Snow White, they had retained the damaging stereotype of the Seven Dwarfs. Disney responded: &quot;We are taking a different approach with these seven characters and have been consulting with members of the dwarfism community. We look forward to sharing more as the film heads into production after a lengthy development period&quot;. Fellow dwarf actor and professional wrestler Hornswoggle criticized Dinklage for his comments, claiming he was trying to reduce the number of roles available for dwarf actors.

<text>Verne Jay Troyer (January 1, 1969 – April 21, 2018) was an American actor. He was best known for playing Mini-Me in the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film series. He had cartilage–hair hypoplasia and was tall.

==Early life==
Troyer was born in Sturgis, Michigan, on January 1, 1969, the son of Susan, a factory worker, and Reuben Troyer, a repair technician. He had two siblings, Davon and Deborah. He stated that his parents &quot;never treated me any different than my other average-sized siblings. I used to have to carry wood, feed the cows and pigs and farm animals.&quot; Troyer was initially raised Amish, but his parents left the faith when he was a child. During his childhood, Troyer spent much time visiting Amish relatives in Centreville, Michigan. He graduated in 1987 from Centreville High School, where a plaque was dedicated to him in 2003.

==Career==
Troyer&#x27;s film career began when a former president of Little People of America contacted him, looking for someone to serve as a stunt double for the infant character &quot;Baby Bink&quot; in John Hughes&#x27; film &quot;Baby&#x27;s Day Out&quot; (1994). He gained further work as a stunt double with some minor comedic roles in several films of the 1990s, including &quot;Dunston Checks In&quot;, &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot; (both 1996), &quot;Men in Black&quot; (1997), and &quot;My Giant&quot; (1998). He is also known for an appearance in an Apple PowerBook G4 advertisement.

He first met with Jay Roach to discuss portraying Mini-Me in the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; series, directed by Roach and starring co-creator Mike Myers, before filming for the series&#x27; second film began. Myers was impressed with Troyer&#x27;s performance, rewriting the script for &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; (1999) to give Mini-Me more screen time and remove the character&#x27;s death. Troyer reprised the role three years later in &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot; (2002), and collaborated again with Myers on &quot;The Love Guru&quot; (2008).

After reaching a large audience as Mini-Me, Troyer portrayed Griphook in &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001), and played the role of Percy in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s fantasy film &quot;The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus&quot; (2009). He also made several appearances as himself in reality television series, including &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; (2005), &quot;Welcome to Sweden&quot; (2007), and the British &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 6&quot; (2009), in which he placed fourth.

==Personal life==
On June 25, 2008, a private home video was leaked of Troyer and his former live-in girlfriend Ranae Shrider having sex. The video, recorded in 2008 in Beverly Hills, California, and Shrider&#x27;s hometown of Fort Cobb, Oklahoma, was leaked to the public by Shrider and TMZ. Kevin Blatt, the man responsible for brokering the deal for Paris Hilton&#x27;s sex tape in 2003, tried to sell the video. Troyer, through his long-time attorney, Ed McPherson, sued TMZ, Blatt, and online rental company SugarDVD, for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement.

In early April 2018, Troyer was admitted to a hospital after an incident in his home. He had previously been admitted to rehab to undergo treatment for alcoholism.

==Death==
Troyer died at a hospital in Los Angeles on April 21, 2018, at age 49. His death was later ruled a suspected suicide by alcohol intoxication. He was interred with his parents in Leonidas Cemetery in St. Joseph County, Michigan.

<doc id="418469" wikidata="Q434328" url="?curid=418469" title="Leopold Godowsky">
<text>Leopold Mordkhelovich Godowsky Sr. (13 February 1870 – 21 November 1938) was a Lithuanian-born American virtuoso pianist, composer and teacher. He was one of the most highly regarded performers of his time, known for his theories concerning the application of relaxed weight and economy of motion within pianistic technique – principles later propagated by his pupils, such as Heinrich Neuhaus.

He was heralded among musical giants as the &quot;Buddha of the Piano&quot;. Ferruccio Busoni claimed that he and Godowsky were &quot;the only composers to have added anything of significance to keyboard writing since Franz Liszt.&quot;

As a composer, Godowsky is best known for his &quot;Java Suite&quot;, &quot;Triakontameron&quot;, &quot;Passacaglia&quot; and &quot;Walzermasken&quot;, alongside his transcriptions of works by other composers; the best-known of these works are the &quot;53 Studies on Chopin&#x27;s Études&quot; (1894–1914).

==Life==

Leopold Godowsky was born in Žasliai (then Vilna Governorate, Russian Empire, now Lithuania) to parents of Jewish ancestry, Mordkhel Godowsky (1848–1872), from Merkinė, and Khana-Sheyna Godowsky (&quot; Levin, 1848–1918), from Gelvonai. His parents were married on 4 December 1868 in Širvintos. Godowsky&#x27;s father, a respected feldsher, died in a cholera epidemic only eighteen months after his son&#x27;s birth, and Leopold was raised by his mother and foster-parents, Louis and Minna Passinock, in Vilnius.

His talent manifested itself very early, and by age five Godowsky was already composing and becoming proficient on both piano and violin. He gave his first concert at age nine, and toured throughout Lithuania and East Prussia soon afterwards. Although he received a few lessons in his childhood, Godowsky was almost completely self-taught. Godowsky wrote in his autobiographical fragment, &quot;Retrospect&quot;:

After briefly studying under Ernst Rudorff at the Königliche Hochschule für Musik in Berlin he left for the United States, where he made his first concert appearance in Boston in 1884. In 1885–86 Godowsky continued his American career, first playing at the New York Casino, and then, in 1886, embarking on a large tour of north-eastern US and Canada with violinist Ovide Musin. In 1887 he returned to Europe and gave numerous recitals in Paris and London, eventually becoming a protégé and friend of Camille Saint-Saëns.

In 1890 he returned to the United States and began a pedagogical career by joining the staff of the New York College of Music. On 30 April 1891 Godowsky married Frieda Saxe, a childhood friend, and the day after his marriage became a citizen of the United States. In 1891–93 he held a teaching position at the Gilbert Raynolds Combs&#x27;s Broad Street Conservatory in Philadelphia, and then settled in Chicago, where he taught at the Chicago Conservatory. By the late 1890s Godowsky was extremely well known in North America.

Together with Teresa Carreño, Godowsky was the first pianist to teach the principle of &quot;weight release&quot; as distinct from purely muscular momentum; also during the same decade, the first of Godowsky&#x27;s studies on Chopin études were composed and published, later to become part of a large series, one of Godowsky&#x27;s most famous works. In 1897–98 Godowsky further cemented his fame by giving a series of eight concerts surveying the entire 19th century repertoire.

A particularly successful concert at the Beethoven Hall (&quot;Beethoven-Saal&quot;) in Berlin, on 6 December 1900, enhanced Godowsky&#x27;s reputation greatly. He moved to Berlin, again dividing his time between performing and teaching and giving a concert tour every year. In 1909 he took over Ferruccio Busoni&#x27;s master classes at the Vienna Academy of Music, where he continued to teach until 1914. Between 1912 and 1914 Godowsky gave several concerts in the United States and also made his first gramophone records there.

In 1914 the outbreak of World War I drove him away from Europe and he went back to the United States, where he lived in New York (1914–16), Los Angeles (1916–19), and Seattle (1919–22), before returning to New York. Much of the 1920s was spent touring around the world; apart from concert appearances in Europe and the United States, Godowsky also gave extensive tours of South America and East Asia.

Also during the 1920s he recorded many rolls for the Duo-Art reproducing pianos, the only reproducing piano mechanism that was available in concert grand Steinways. Godowsky also recorded a large number of piano rolls for the American Piano Company.

However, while Godowsky&#x27;s career prospered, his personal life slowly started falling apart. His wife Frieda fell seriously ill in 1924 and her health continued to deteriorate. In 1928 Godowsky&#x27;s son Gordon abandoned his studies and married a vaudeville dancer, causing his father to disown him.

After the Wall Street crash of 1929 Godowsky&#x27;s financial situation worsened. A string of recordings the pianist began in London in 1928, as well as public concerts, would have remedied the problem; however, both activities were cut short by an unexpected disaster: during a recording session on 17 June 1930, just after completing Chopin&#x27;s E major Scherzo, the pianist suffered a severe stroke which left him partially paralysed. Godowsky&#x27;s remaining years were overshadowed by the event, leaving him deeply depressed.

In December 1932 Gordon Godowsky died by suicide, and a year later Godowsky&#x27;s wife died of a heart attack. The pianist eventually moved to another apartment in New York together with his daughter Dagmar; he continued playing piano for friends and admirers, but never again gave public performances.

In his last years, Godowsky put much effort into organizing a &quot;World Synod of Music and Musicians&quot; and an &quot;International Council of Music and Musicians&quot;, but neither project materialized. After spending much of 1937 and 1938 suffering from various health problems, Godowsky died of stomach cancer on 21 November 1938, at the age of 68. He is buried in the Temple Israel Cemetery in Westchester County, New York.

His son Leopold Godowsky Jr. was the co-inventor (with Leopold Mannes) of Kodachrome photo transparency film, as well as a violinist. Leopold Jr. married George Gershwin&#x27;s younger sister, Frances, thus continuing the musical line.

His daughter, the actress Dagmar Godowsky (1897–1975), appeared as a co-lead in various Hollywood silent movies, including some with Rudolph Valentino. She was a popular socialite and wrote an autobiography titled &quot;First Person Plural&quot; (New York, 1958).

==Compositions==

As a composer, Godowsky has been best known for his paraphrases of piano pieces by other composers, which he enhanced with ingenious contrapuntal devices and rich chromatic harmonies. His most famous work in this genre is the &quot;53 Studies on Chopin&#x27;s Études&quot; (1894–1914), in which he varies the (already challenging) original études using various methods: introducing countermelodies, transferring the technically difficult passages from the right hand to the left, transcribing an entire piece for left hand solo, or even interweaving two études, with the left hand playing one and the right hand the other.

The pieces are among the most difficult piano works ever written, and only a few pianists have ventured to perform any of them. Among such pianists are Marc-André Hamelin, who recorded the entire set and garnered a number of prestigious awards, and Francesco Libetta, who performed the complete set in concert (the only pianist to do so from memory) and made a video recording of the set (live in Milan, March 2006). Other pianists who frequently perform Godowsky are Boris Berezovsky, Konstantin Scherbakov and Emanuele Delucchi.

Other important transcriptions by Godowsky include &quot;Renaissance&quot; (1906–09), a collection which includes arrangements of music by Rameau and Lully, &quot;12 Schubert Songs&quot; (1927), and six transcriptions of Bach&#x27;s music for solo cello and solo violin, arranged for piano, but with complementary voices, etc.

Although his transcriptions are much more well known, Godowsky also composed a number of substantial original works. He considered the &quot;Passacaglia&quot; (1927) and a collection of pieces for left hand alone (1930–31) to be his most mature creations; both, however, employ traditional approach to harmony and counterpoint. A more experimental work was the &quot;Java Suite (Phonoramas)&quot; (1925), composed after a visit to Java, under the influence of gamelan music. Godowsky was equally comfortable writing large-scale works like the &quot;Passacaglia&quot; or the five-movement &quot;Piano Sonata in E minor&quot; (1911) as he was creating collections of smaller pieces, such as the &quot;46 Miniatures&quot; for piano four hands and the &quot;Triakontameron&quot; (1920; subtitled &quot;30 moods and scenes in triple measure&quot;).

Quite a number of Godowsky&#x27;s original works are considerably difficult to perform; the &quot;Passacaglia&quot; (which consists of 44 variations, cadenza and fugue on the opening theme of Franz Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Unfinished&quot; Symphony) was declared to be unplayable even by Vladimir Horowitz, who claimed it would require six hands to perform. Nevertheless, the work has had a number of recordings.

Despite their traditionalism, Godowsky&#x27;s compositions may have influenced Maurice Ravel and Sergei Prokofiev.

==Reception and influence==

Godowsky was one of the most highly regarded pianists of his time, praised by listeners, colleagues, and critics alike. Arthur Rubinstein remarked that it would take him &quot;five hundred years to get a mechanism like [Godowsky&#x27;s]&quot;, while Ferruccio Busoni considered himself and Godowsky to be the only composers to have made substantial contributions to keyboard writing and performance since Liszt.

Godowsky&#x27;s phenomenally difficult transcriptions and impeccable technique prompted some critics to describe him as &quot;a pianist for pianists&quot;, as James Huneker has done. Among Godowsky&#x27;s admirers were such distinguished pianists as Vladimir de Pachmann and Sergei Rachmaninoff, who, according to Godowsky&#x27;s daughter Dagmar, idolized her father&#x27;s music and performances.

Even those who disliked Godowsky&#x27;s interpretations usually acknowledged his tremendous technical gifts: Claudio Arrau, for example, declared Godowsky &quot;one of the greatest technicians&quot;, even though he considered his playing &quot;boring&quot; and complained that Godowsky &quot;never played above mezzo-forte.&quot;

Godowsky&#x27;s vast repertoire spanned more than two centuries of music, from contemporary music to that of Rameau and Lully, whose music he transcribed. Although he regularly played public concerts until 1930, Godowsky was plagued by stage fright, and particularly disliked the recording studio, like many performers of his time. On one occasion, he described the recording process thus:
The fear of doing a trifling wrong augmented while playing; the better one succeeded in playing the foregoing, the greater the fear became while playing. It was a dreadful ordeal, increasingly so the more sensitive the artist, I broke down in my health in London in the Spring of 1930, owing to these nerve-killing tortures. How can one think of emotion!
Consequently, it was acknowledged that Godowsky&#x27;s best work was not in public or in the recording studio, but at home. After leaving Godowsky&#x27;s home one night, Josef Hofmann told Abram Chasins: &quot;Never forget what you heard tonight; never lose the memory of that sound. There is nothing like it in the world. It is tragic that the world has never heard Popsy as only he can play.&quot;

Godowsky&#x27;s pupils included Paul Wells, Apolinary Szeluto, Jan Smeterlin, Issay Dobrowen, Tina Lerner, Fannie Charles Dillon, Alice Frisca, Leonard Liebling, Abbey Simon, Hanna Vollenhoven, Myrtle Elvyn, and Heinrich Neuhaus, who taught Sviatoslav Richter, Emil Gilels, and Radu Lupu, among others.

<text>Morea ( or ) was the name of the Peloponnese peninsula in southern Greece during the Middle Ages and the early modern period. The name was used by the Principality of Achaea, the Byzantine province known as the Despotate of the Morea, by the Ottoman Empire for the Morea Eyalet, and later by the Republic of Venice for the short-lived Kingdom of the Morea.

==Etymology==
There is some uncertainty over the origin of the medieval name &quot;Morea&quot;, which is first recorded in the 10th century in the Byzantine chronicles.

Traditionally, scholars thought the name to have originated from the word &quot;morea&quot; (μορέα), meaning morus or mulberry, a tree which, though known in the region from the ancient times, gained value after the 6th century, when mulberry-eating silkworms were smuggled from China to Byzantium.

The British Byzantinist Steven Runciman suggested that the name comes &quot;from the likeness of its shape to that of a mulberry leaf&quot;.

==History==

After the conquest of Constantinople by the forces of the Fourth Crusade (1204), two groups of Franks undertook the occupation of the Morea. They created the Principality of Achaea, a largely Greek-inhabited statelet ruled by a Latin (Western) autocrat. In referring to the Peloponnese, they followed local practice and used the name &quot;Morea&quot;.

The most important prince in the Morea was Guillaume II de Villehardouin (1246–1278), who fortified Mistra (Mystras) near the site of Sparta in 1249. After losing the Battle of Pelagonia (1259) against the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaeologus, Guillaume was forced to ransom himself by giving up most of the eastern part of Morea and his newly built strongholds. An initial Byzantine drive to reconquer the entire peninsula failed in the battles of Prinitza and Makryplagi, and the Byzantines and Franks settled to an uneasy coexistence.

In the mid-14th century, the later Byzantine Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos reorganized Morea into the Despotate of the Morea. Sons of the emperor with the rank of &quot;despotes&quot; were usually sent to rule the province as an appanage. By 1430, the Byzantines eventually recovered the remainder of the Frankish part of the Morea, but in 1460 the peninsula was almost completely overrun and conquered by the Ottoman Empire. In these conquests, the coastal and port cities remained in the hands of the Venetians such as Monemvasia, Lepanto, Modon, Koron, but these places were captured during the reigns of Bayezid II and Süleyman I. In July 1461, the last holdout, Salmeniko Castle, was taken.

The peninsula was captured for the Republic of Venice by Francesco Morosini during the Morean War of 1684–99. Venetian rule proved unpopular, and the Ottomans recaptured the Morea in a lightning campaign in 1714. Under renewed Ottoman rule, centered at Tripolitsa, the region enjoyed relative prosperity. The latter 18th century was marked by renewed dissatisfaction. Armed bands of the klephts emerged, undeterred by the brutal repression of the Orlov revolt. They waged guerrilla war against the Turks, aided both by the decay of Ottoman power and the emergence of Greek national consciousness. Ultimately, the Morea and its inhabitants provided the cradle and backbone of the Greek Revolution.

==Chronicle of the Morea==
The anonymous 14th century &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot; relates events of the Franks&#x27; establishment of feudalism in mainland Greece following the Fourth Crusade. Despite its unreliability about historical events, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; is famous for its lively portrayal of life in the feudal community. The language in Greek versions is notable as it reflects the rapid transition from Medieval to Modern Greek. The original language of the Chronicle is disputed, but recent scholarship prefers the Greek version in MS &quot;Havniensis 57&quot; (14th–15th century, in Copenhagen). Other manuscripts include the Ms &quot;Parisinus graecus 2898&quot; (15th–16th century, at the , Paris). The difference of about one century in the texts shows a considerable number of linguistic differences due to the rapid evolution of the Greek language.

The original title ranged from &quot;De Avonturen van Detectief Van Zwam&quot; in 1947 to &quot;De Avonturen van Nero en zijn Hoed&quot; in 1950, and finally &quot;De Avonturen van Nero &amp; Co&quot; from 1951. It ran in continuous syndication until 2002. From 1947 until 1993 it was all drawn by Sleen himself. From 1992 until 2002 Dirk Stallaert took over the drawing while Sleen kept inventing the stories.

Together with &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot; and &quot;Jommeke&quot;, &quot;Nero&quot; is regarded as the Big Three of Flemish comics. The stories were noted for their satirical content, with references to politicians and celebrities of the day. With &quot;Nero&quot;, Marc Sleen holds the world record of issues of a comic book series title drawn by the same author. He drew &quot;The Adventures of Nero&quot; singlehandedly from 1947 to 1992 without any assistance from other artists. This feat is even more remarkable considering he also drew other comic strip series from 1947 to 1965.

From 1 January 2030, all comics series by Marc Sleen, including &quot;Nero&quot;, will enter public domain, in accordance with the Marc Sleen Foundation. 

==History==

The series debuted in the newspaper &quot;De Nieuwe Gids&quot; in the autumn of 1947 and was written and drawn by Marc Sleen from the start. Originally the central character was Detective Van Zwam, but early in the first story &quot;Het Geheim van Matsuoka&quot; (&quot;The Secret of Matsuoka&quot;) (1947), Van Zwam meets a man who has drunk from a serum that makes people go insane and thinks he is the Roman emperor Nero. The character was also dressed in a toga with some laurel leaves behind his ears. Near the end of the story the character regained his senses and revealed his real name was &quot;Schoonpaard&quot; (in reprints this was changed to &quot;Heiremans&quot;, in both cases inside joke references to colleagues of Sleen). &quot;SchoonPaard&quot; is probably a &quot;typo&quot;, since in one of the first panels, &quot;SchoonBaard&quot; is one of the missing persons, and also the name of a colleague. The character proved popular and remained a friend of Van Zwam in the next stories, though everyone kept referring to him as &quot;Nero&quot; rather than by his real name. After nine stories, the series was renamed after &quot;Nero&quot; and Van Zwam became a side character instead.

In 1950 Sleen left &quot;De Nieuwe Gids&quot; and joined the newspaper &quot;Het Volk&quot;. During the 1940s, 1950s and 1960 &quot;The Adventures of Nero&quot; was popular enough to rival Willy Vandersteen&#x27;s &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot; which was published in &quot;De Standaard&quot;. In 1965 Sleen joined &quot;De Standaard&quot; too, following a legal dispute with his publishers. The first 53 &quot;Nero&quot; stories, which were published in black-and-white, remained property of Uitgeverij Het Volk. From &quot;Het Bobobeeldje&quot; (&quot;The Bobo Statue&quot;) (1965) on all new &quot;Nero&quot; stories were published in &quot;De Standaard&quot; and &quot;Het Nieuwsblad&quot;, after which they were released as colour albums.

Sleen continued drawing &quot;Nero&quot; for many decades. Only in 1992 did he finally hire an assistant, Dirk Stallaert, to do the drawing for him, because his eyesight had become too poor. Stallaert was promoted as Sleen&#x27;s successor but in 2002 he decided to leave the series in favour of work at Vandersteen&#x27;s studio. Sleen then terminated the series for good. Stallaert still draws &quot;Nero&quot;-related publicity images and merchandise.

The early stories had a random length, often around 240 strips, while the latter ones (from 1965 on) had a length of 32 pages of 4 strips each. Every day, two strips appeared in the newspaper.

==Concept==

&quot;The Adventures of Nero&quot; is a humorous adventure comic strip about Nero, an unemployed man who describes himself as &quot;newspaper appearance&quot; and prefers reading his newspaper on his sofa. He and his wife, named &quot;Madam Nero&quot; (&quot;Madam Nero&quot;) by everyone, have one son, Adhemar, who is a child prodigy. Nero has an eccentric group of friends, who often help him out or force him to set out on an adventure. Many stories display a love for nature and the animal world, which mirrors the creator&#x27;s own frequent safari trips. Since the album &quot;Het Groene Vuur&quot; (&quot;The Green Fire&quot;) (1965) nearly all &quot;Nero&quot; albums end with a traditional waffle feast, where Madam Nero and Madam Pheip bake waffles for the entire cast.

With two strips published a day, six days a week, the comic strip followed daily news events quite closely and often made references to real life news events. In the story &quot;De IJzeren Kolonel&quot; (&quot;The Iron Colonel&quot;) (1956), for instance, the then-current Suez Crisis and Hungarian Uprising are incorporated into the plot. The series also had cameos by several Belgian and internationally famous politicians, such as Paul-Henri Spaak, Achiel Van Acker, Paul Vanden Boeynants, Wilfried Martens, Jean-Pierre Van Rossem, Jean-Luc Dehaene, Jozef Stalin, Mobutu, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Hirohito, Fidel Castro, Richard Nixon, Idi Amin, Khomeini, Margaret Thatcher and Saddam Hussein. Media celebrities, such as The Beatles, Pablo Escobar, Urbanus, Paul Newman and Frank Zappa were also frequently caricatured. Sleen also gave himself cameos in several stories. Very exceptional was the fact that all these jokes about past politics were not removed when the newspaper episodes were published in album format. This is the major reason why &quot;Nero&quot; provides readers with an overview of almost 60 years of post-war history in Belgium.

Since Sleen worked without assistance for the majority of his career, he kept his drawing style simple and efficient. He had no time for elaborate detailed drawings and as a result many of his stories are filled to the brim with continuity errors or off-model drawing mistakes. Contrary to other comics, many readers accept this as part of &quot;Nero&quot;&#x27;s charm. Only when Dirk Stallaert took over the drawings did the art work become more technically detailed, with more attention towards space and perspective.

==Main characters==
During its 55-year course, a lot of regular characters joined the original duo of Nero and Van Zwam.

* Nero is the main protagonist. Essentially good-hearted, he can also be a selfish, lazy man, who does not know how to keep his money and always gets himself into trouble. Nero is one of the very few anti-heroes to lead a comic strip.
* His wife (often called Madam Nero or, in some stories, Bea) stays mainly at home and tries to keep a semblance of a household while her husband is off to some far-flung corner of the Earth. If needs be, she knows how to defend herself.
* Detective Van Zwam is a private detective. Driving a Porsche 911 (which seems to crash at least once every comic), he is always at the scene of a crime extremely quickly, and can make the most brilliant deductions out of the smallest clues (often a cigarette stub).
* Adhemar is Nero&#x27;s son. He is a child prodigy. He is only a few years old, but has received numerous Nobel prizes and Ph.D.s. His major hobby is building rockets, called Adhemar I, II, ... They also tend to crash somewhere in every story, but are a major means to get to the exotic countries where the stories often take place.
* Meneer Pheip is the bourgeois friend of Nero. In initial albums it appears he can only speak a broken, French-sounding kind of Flemish due to his French-speaking background. Later, he is portrayed as an old-fashioned Flemish nouveau riche, who thinks it is fitting that he speaks some poor kind of French instead of Dutch (a reference to the language battle between the Flemish and the French-speaking communities).
* Madam Pheip is his wife. She is a pipe-smoking bully, loyal to her kids, herself, her husband, and her friends (in that order). When necessary, she can make a smoke curtain with her pipe.
* Petatje is the adopted daughter of the Pheips. Her father and mother died when she was very young. Initially, she was adopted by Nero, but soon got to live with the Pheips. Her name, &quot;Petatje&quot;, is a reference to the Flemish word for potato being &quot;patat&quot; (in dialect pronounced as &quot;petat&quot;). 
* Petoetje is their adopted son. He is actually the son of a Papuan king, and is extremely bright. Petoetje and Petatje are treated like children (which they are, around 10 years old) by their step-parents, even though they act more maturely most of the time.
* Clo-Clo is the younger son of the Pheips. His main characteristic is wearing a large moustache, despite being a toddler. He weeps for the smallest reason.
* Abraham Tuizentfloot is &quot;the last pirate still alive&quot;, or so he believes. Armed with a dagger or sometimes a cannon, he is very easily irritated and chases everyone around. He can pop up in a story at any given time and it can never be predicted what he might do next. His name is a conflation of &quot;duizendpoot&quot; (jack of all trades) and &quot;vloot&quot; (fleet). 
* Captain Oliepul is the captain of a tugboat named &#x27;His Majesty&#x27;s Pull&#x27;. He is a good friend of Nero, and has saved him many times. He&#x27;s Marc Sleen&#x27;s &quot;deus ex machina&quot;: whenever characters seem to be drowning, at the very last moment captain Oliepul coincidentally passes by and saves them just in time.
* Jan Spier is an extremely strong man, who is said to be the last descendant of Jan Breydel. His last name means &quot;muscle&quot; in Dutch. He makes a living selling French fries or chips. He disappeared for many years in the middle part of the series, but readers convinced Sleen to let Jan Spier reappear. During the run of the series, he was married to at least two different women, Minoetje and Isabella. No divorce was ever mentioned or other explanation given.
* Officer Gaston was the last character to become a regular in the comic, and appeared very late, in 1995, twenty years after the birth of Clo-Clo (at that point the last regular to be added to the cast). Gaston is fat, not too bright, and at times incredibly incompetent. However, somehow he has managed to save Nero a few times.
* Jef Pedal is present from the first album, but soon fades away. He is an amateur pilot, and, though of slender build, often overcomes enemies by beating them with a hammer he invariably carries in an inner pocket.
* Nero&#x27;s worst enemies are the Maltese (see: &quot;De Spekschieter&quot;) bandit Ricardo and a devil called Geraard de Duivel (&quot;Gerard the Devil&quot;, named after the medieval building, Geeraard de Duivelsteen, in Ghent).

==Popularity and influence==

During its heyday &quot;Nero&quot; was the second most popular Flemish comic strip, after &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot;. The albums sold well, also because they were a lot cheaper than their main rival. From the late 1940s until the early 1960s all the stories were published on cheap paper and often smelt of fresh ink. During the 1960s Jef Nys&#x27; &quot;Jommeke&quot; overshadowed &quot;Nero&quot;&#x27;s sales among children.

Attempts have been made to translate &quot;Nero&quot; to the Dutch, British, French, German and South African market. Except for in Wallonia and the Netherlands, the translated versions of &quot;Nero&quot; never caught on. Sleen has very rarely used his characters for merchandising or other commercializations.

&quot;Nero&quot; was very influential for the development of comics in Flanders. Its loose drawing style and story lines replete with folly were an inspiration for &quot;Urbanus&quot;, &quot;Biebel&quot;, &quot;Cowboy Henk&quot;, among others. Dutch artists like Martin Lodewijk (&quot;Agent 327&quot;) and René Windig and Eric De Jong (&quot;Heinz&quot;) are also notable fans.

==In popular culture==

The Flemish comics prize Bronzen Adhemar is named and sculpted after the character Adhemar. In Turnhout, where the award ceremony is traditionally held, a huge statue of Adhemar can be seen in the Warande park since June 15, 1991. It was created by Frank-Ivo Van Damme.

Several characters from the series also have their own statues. Nero has a bronze statue in Hoeilaart, sculpted by Luc Cauwenberghs, which was erected in 1994 in front of the old tram station. In the series this building is Nero&#x27;s house since the story &quot;De Verschrikkelijke Tweeling&quot; (&quot;The Horrible Twin&quot;) (1992). The station has been redecorated as a &quot;Nero&quot;-themed café. Nero has another statue in front of the casino in Middelkerke. Meneer Pheip has a statue in the Statiestraat in Moerbeke-Waas, the village of which he supposedly is the major. It was sculpted by Guy Du Cheyne on August 24, 2012. In the Dorpsstraat in Wuustwezel sculptor Gilbert Uitdenhouwen made a statue of Abraham Tuizentfloot, which was revealed in 2000.

The organisation &quot;Nero-Harmonie&quot; in Hoeilaart and a mountain bike route have been named after &quot;Nero&quot;.

In 1984 composer Johan De Smet, conductor Vincent D&#x27;Hondt and director Arne Sierens chose upon the &quot;Nero&quot; story &quot;Het Rattenkasteel&quot; (&quot;The Rats&#x27; Castle&quot;) (1947) for an opera adaptation. It premiered as &quot;Het Rattenkasteel&quot;.

The entire cast of the series was sculpted on a bas-relief in Sint-Niklaas, made by sculptor Paul Dekker in 1988 to commemorate Marc Sleen&#x27;s appointment as an honorary citizen of the city.

In the Belgian Comic Strip Center in Brussels the permanent exhibition pays homage to the pioneers of Belgian comics, among them Marc Sleen. In the room dedicated to his work everything is designed to look like Nero&#x27;s cosy home, complete with a tower of Belgian waffles and champagne nearby.

Nero is among the many Belgian comics characters to have, facetiously, a Brussels street named after them. The Rue de la Fourche/ Greepstraat has a commemorative plaque with the name &quot;Rue Néron/ Nerostraat&quot; placed under the actual street sign.

In 1995 a wall was dedicated to &quot;Nero&quot; at the Sint-Goriksplein/Place Saint-Géry in Brussels, where it is part of the Brussels&#x27; Comic Book Route. Between 1996 and 2011 Hasselt also had a wall. In 2014 a wall was dedicated to &quot;Nero&quot; in the Kloosterstraat in Antwerp, depicting a scene from the album &quot;De Oliespuiter&quot; (&quot;The Oil Injector&quot;).

The Marc Sleen Museum in the Zandstraat in Brussels is dedicated to Sleen and his creations. It was opened in 2009. The museum organizes a special tourists&#x27; route in Brussels, based on several locations that appeared in &quot;Nero&quot; comic book albums, including the Black Tower, Palais de Justice, Kapellekerk, The Sablon, Brussels Central Station, the Grand-Place and Manneken Pis. One has to make an appointment, though.

Nero, the dog of the character Carmen Waterslaeghers in the successful Flemish TV sitcom &quot;FC De Kampioenen&quot;, was named after Nero. In one of the episodes Carmen is thinking of a name for her dog and coincidentally sees the daily &quot;Nero&quot; comic in the newspaper.

<text>The Open Data-Link Interface (ODI), developed by Apple and Novell, serves the same function as Microsoft and 3COM&#x27;s Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS). Originally, ODI was written for NetWare and Macintosh environments. Like NDIS, ODI provides rules that establish a vendor-neutral interface between the protocol stack and the adapter driver. It resides in Layer 2, the Data Link layer, of the OSI model. This interface also enables one or more network drivers to support one or more protocol stacks.

<doc id="418480" wikidata="Q3273647" url="?curid=418480" title="EgyptAir Flight 648">
<text>EgyptAir Flight 648 was a regularly scheduled international flight between Athens Ellinikon International Airport (Greece) and Cairo International Airport (Egypt). On 23 November 1985, a Boeing 737-266 airliner, servicing the flight was hijacked by the Palestinian terrorist organization Abu Nidal. The subsequent raid on the aircraft by Egyptian troops killed 56 of the 86 passengers, 2 of the 3 hijackers and 2 of the 6 crew, making the hijacking of Flight 648 one of the deadliest such incidents in history.

== Aircraft ==
The aircraft involved was a nine-year-old Boeing 737-266, MSN 21191, registered as SU-AYH, that was manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes in 1976. It was equipped with two Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-17 engines.

==Hijacking==

On 23 November 1985, Flight 648 took off at 8 pm on its Athens-to-Cairo route. Ten minutes after takeoff, three Palestinian members of the Abu Nidal gang hijacked the aircraft, the same group also responsible for the hijacking of Pan Am Flight 73 a year later. The terrorists, declaring themselves to be Egyptian revolutionaries by the intercom, were well armed with guns and grenades.

The terrorists&#x27; commander, Salem Chakore, proceeded to check all passports while Omar Rezaq went to the cockpit to change the aircraft&#x27;s course. At the same time, Chakore had the European, Australian, Israeli, and American passengers sit in the front of the aircraft while the rest, including the Greeks and Egyptians were sent to the back. Chakore saw an Australian passenger, Tony Lyons (aged 36), holding a camera. Believing Lyons had taken a picture of him, Chakore took the camera and ripped the film out before slamming the camera into the wall. Chakore came to an Egyptian Security Service agent, Methad Mustafa Kamal (aged 26), who reached into his coat as if to pull out his passport. Instead, he withdrew a handgun and began shooting, killing Chakore; he subsequently engaged in a shootout with the other hijacker, Bou Said Nar Al-din Mohammed (Nar Al-Din Bou Said). Nineteen shots were fired until Kamal and two flight attendants were wounded by Rezaq. In the exchange of fire the fuselage was punctured, causing a rapid depressurization. The aircraft was forced to descend to to allow the crew and passengers to breathe, with the oxygen masks deploying.

Libya was the original destination of the hijackers, but due to a lack of fuel, damage from the shootout and negative publicity, Malta was chosen. While approaching Malta the aircraft was running dangerously low on fuel, experiencing serious pressurization problems and carrying wounded passengers. However, Maltese authorities did not give permission for the aircraft to land; the Maltese government had previously refused permission to other hijacked aircraft, including on 23 September 1982 when an Alitalia aircraft was hijacked on its way to Italy. The hijackers insisted, and forced the pilots Hani Galal and Imad Mounib (both aged 39) to land at Luqa Airport. As a last attempt to stop the landing, the runway lights were switched off, but the pilot managed to land the damaged aircraft safely.

==Nationalities==

Breakdown of passengers and crew by nationality as per &quot;New York Times&quot;. A notable passenger was actress Lupita Pallás, who, with her daughter Laila, were among the fatalities.

==Standoff==

At first, Maltese authorities were optimistic they could solve the crisis. Malta had good relations with the Arab world, and 12 years earlier had successfully resolved a potentially more serious situation when a KLM Flight 861, a Boeing 747-200, landed there under similar circumstances. The Maltese Premier, Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, rushed to the airport&#x27;s control tower and assumed responsibility for the negotiations.

The remaining two hijackers allowed medics and engineers to examine the injured and the damage to the airplane, respectively. The medics confirmed that the commanding hijacker, Salem Chakore, was dead while the sky marshal that killed him, Kamal, was still alive. In a rage, Omar Rezaq, who assumed command of the hijacking, shot Kamal again as he was led off the plane. Somehow, Kamal survived. The doctor told Rezaq the sky marshal was dead and was able to get him off the airplane.

Aided by an interpreter, Bonnici refused to refuel the aircraft, or to withdraw Maltese armed forces which had surrounded the plane, until all passengers were released. 16 Filipino and 16 Egyptian passengers and two injured flight attendants were allowed off the plane. The hijackers then started shooting hostages, starting with Tamar Artzi (aged 24), an Israeli woman, whom they shot in the head and back. Artzi survived her wounds. Assuming command of the hijacking, Rezaq threatened to kill a passenger every 15 minutes until his demands were met. His next victim was Nitzan Mendelson (aged 23), another Israeli woman, who died a week later after being declared brain dead. Mendelson realized what was to happen so she resisted. Rezaq grabbed her by the hair and led her out onto the staircase before shooting her. While tossing Mendelson&#x27;s body down the stairs, he noticed Artzi move. He shot her through the back from the top of the stairs. Again, Artzi survived her wounds. He then targeted three Americans, having their hands tied behind them.

After the shooting of Mendelson, Maltese soldiers surrounded the airplane. Spotting them from the cockpit window, Rezaq demanded that the soldiers be withdrawn. Negotiators told him he had no choice but to surrender. Rezaq was informed that if the plane left Malta, American jets based in Italy would intercept and shoot down the plane. This enraged Rezaq.

By intercom, Rezaq had a flight attendant call forward Patrick Scott Baker (aged 28), an American fisherman-biologist on vacation. Rezaq stepped back when Baker locked eyes with him as he came forward. Tony Lyons, an Australian passenger who could see the stairs platform from his window seat later stated that he saw that Rezaq had to raise his gun in order to shoot Baker. The bullet grazed Baker&#x27;s skull after he moved it at the last second but played dead. Rezaq pushed his body down the steps. Baker waited a few minutes before making a run for it, hands still tied behind his back.

Fifteen minutes later, Rezaq called for Scarlett Marie Rogenkamp (aged 38), a U.S. Air Force civilian employee. Making her kneel on the staircase, Rezaq shot her in the back of the head, killing her instantly. Her body was later taken to a hospital, where she was identified by Baker.

Jackie Nink Pflug (aged 30) wasn&#x27;t shot until the next morning. Of the five passengers shot, Artzi, Baker and Pflug survived; Mendelson died in a Maltese hospital a week after the hijacking after being declared brain dead. For five hours, Pflug drifted in and out of consciousness until an airport grounds crew retrieved her body on its way to the morgue. They discovered she was still alive and rushed her to the nearby hospital.

France, the United Kingdom, and the United States all offered to send anti-hijack forces. Bonnici was pressured by the hijackers, the United States, and Egypt ambassadors, who were all at the airport. The non-aligned Maltese government feared that the Americans or the Israelis would arrive and take control of the area, as the U.S. Naval Air Station Sigonella was only 20 minutes away. A U.S. Air Force C-130 Hercules with an aeromedical evacuation team from Rhein-Main Air Base (2nd Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron) near Frankfurt, Germany, and rapid-deploying surgical teams from Wiesbaden Air Force Medical Center were on standby at the U.S. Navy Hospital at Naples. 

When the U.S. told Maltese authorities that Egypt had a special forces counterterrorism team trained by the U.S. Delta Force ready to move in, they were granted permission to come. The Egyptian Unit 777 commanded by Major-General Kamal Attia was flown in, with four American officers. Negotiations were prolonged as much as possible, and it was agreed that the airplane should be attacked on the morning of 25 November when food was to be taken into the aircraft. Soldiers dressed as caterers would jam the door open and attack.

==Raid==
Without warning, Egyptian commandos began the raid about an hour and a half before it had been planned originally. They blasted open the passenger doors and luggage compartment doors with explosives. Fifty-two passengers – including pregnant women and children – suffocated from the fumes that enveloped the aircraft when the soldiers placed a bomb underneath the fuselage to break into the hold. Another five were shot by them. According to Dr Abela Medici, two kilos of highly-explosive Semtex were used, which provided more power than was necessary to allow the commandos safe entry into the airplane. Mifsud Bonnici stated that these explosions caused the internal plastic of the airplane to catch fire, causing widespread suffocation. However, the &quot;Times of Malta&quot;, quoting sources at the airport, reported that when the hijackers realized they were being attacked, they lobbed hand grenades into the passenger area, killing people and igniting the fire aboard.

The storming of the aircraft killed 54 of the remaining 87 passengers, as well as two crew members and one hijacker. Only one hijacker — Omar Rezaq, who had survived — remained undetected by the Maltese government. Rezaq came out of the cockpit only to be shot in the chest by a commando, throwing a grenade as he went down. Captain Galal subsequently tried to attack Rezaq with the cockpit axe, but Rezaq managed to escape from the aircraft. (&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported at one point, however, that the hijackers&#x27; commander shot Captain Galal, grazing his forehead, and Captain Galal hit the hijacker with an axe, then Egyptian soldiers shot the hijacker.) None of the Egyptian commandos were killed but one had a leg blown off.

Rezaq removed his hood and ammunition and pretended to be an injured passenger. Egyptian commandos tracked Rezaq to St Luke&#x27;s General Hospital and, holding the doctors and medical staff at gunpoint, entered the casualty ward looking for him. He was arrested when some of the passengers in the hospital recognized him.

Rezaq was tried in Malta, but with no anti-terrorism legislation, he was tried on other charges. There was widespread fear that terrorists would hijack a Maltese airplane or perform a terrorist attack in Malta as an act of retribution. Rezaq received a 25-year sentence. For reasons unclear, Maltese authorities released him some seven years later, in February 1993, and allowed him to board an airplane to Ghana. His release caused a diplomatic incident between Malta and the U.S. because Maltese law strictly prohibits trying a person twice, in any jurisdiction, on charges related to the same series of events (similar to but having wider limitations compared to classic double jeopardy).

Rezaq&#x27;s itinerary was to take him from there to Nigeria, and then to Ethiopia, and finally to Sudan. Ghanaian officials detained Rezaq for several months, but eventually allowed him to proceed to Nigeria. When Rezaq&#x27;s airplane landed in Nigeria, Nigerian authorities denied him entry into the country and handed him to FBI agents departing for the United States. He was brought before a U.S. court and, on 8 October 1996, sentenced to life imprisonment with a no-parole recommendation.

==Aftermath and criticism==
In his 1989 book &quot;Massacre in Malta&quot;, John A. Mizzi wrote:

Mizzi added:

Mizzi also mentioned how Maltese soldiers positioned in the vicinity of the aircraft were equipped with rifles but were not issued ammunition. An Italian secret service report on the incident showed how the fire inside the aircraft was caused by the Egyptian commandos who placed explosives in the aircraft cargo hold, the most vulnerable part of the aircraft, as it held the oxygen tanks which blew up. During the hijacking, only the Socialist Party media and state-controlled television were given information on the incident. Such was the censorship of the media, that the Maltese people first heard of the disaster through radio station RAI TV, when its correspondent Enrico Mentana spoke live on the air via a direct telephone call: &quot;Parlo da Malta. Qui c&#x27;è stato un massacro ...&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m speaking from Malta. Here there&#x27;s just been a massacre ...&quot;) Shortly before this broadcast, a news bulletin on the Maltese national television had erroneously stated that all passengers had been released and were safe.

Decisions taken by the Maltese government drew criticism from overseas. The United States protested to Malta about U.S. personnel sent to resolve the issue having been confined to Air Squadron HQ and the U.S. Embassy in Floriana. The United States had seen the situation as so serious that it had ordered naval ships, including an aircraft carrier, to move toward Malta for contingency purposes.

EgyptAir still flies the Athens–Cairo route, now assigned flight numbers 748 and 750 and flown by Boeing 737-800. The flight number 648 is now on its Riyadh–Cairo route.

==In popular culture==
The events of the hijacking were related in an account by American survivor Jackie Nink Pflug, who had been shot in the head, on the Biography Channel television program &quot;I Survived...&quot;, which was broadcast on 13 April 2009. Laurence Zrinzo, the neurologist and neurosurgeon who established neurosurgery as a subspecialty in the Maltese islands, performed Pflug&#x27;s neurosurgical procedure. She related details about the flight and the attack in her 2001 book, &quot;Miles To Go Before I Sleep&quot;. The incident was chronicled and reenacted in an &quot;Interpol Investigates&quot; episode, &quot;Terror in the Skies&quot;, broadcast by the National Geographic Channel.

The hijacking is recounted in detail by survivors and eyewitnesses in the Declassifed episode, &quot;Terror in the Sky: To Catch a Hijacker.&quot;

The hijacking is also the subject of the book &quot;Valinda, Our Daughter&quot;, written by Canadian author Gladys Taylor.

The events of the hijacking are described in and used to further the plot of Brad Thor&#x27;s novel, &quot;Path of the Assassin&quot;.

A similar situation appeared in the 1999 movie &quot;Mummy&quot; by Russian director Denis Yevstigneyev. This is a movie based on the hijacking of Aeroflot Flight 3739 in 1988.

<text>The Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh (or &quot;TAM&quot;) is a limited-edition personal computer released in 1997 to mark Apple&#x27;s 20th anniversary. The machine was a technological showcase of the day, boasting a number of features beyond simple computing, and with a price tag aimed at the &quot;executive&quot; market.

== History ==
April 1, 1996, marked 20 years since the day that Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne came together to form Apple Computer. As this milestone arrived and came to the attention of Apple&#x27;s then-current executives, the decision was made to release a limited edition Macintosh computer to celebrate—and so the &quot;Spartacus&quot; (or &quot;Pomona&quot;, or &quot;Smoke &amp; Mirrors&quot;) project was born.

The normal time-span to develop a new Macintosh computer was 18+ months, although available time was less. However, the design team had already been working on several &quot;dream&quot; concepts, and soon settled on the most feasible of those: the (almost) all-in-one LCD-based design. To reduce development time, many off-the-shelf components were used on the new computer&#x27;s internals.

The TAM was announced almost 20 years to the day after Jobs and Wozniak incorporated the company, in January 1997 at MacWorld Expo, San Francisco. It was given a release date of March 20, 1997, with a retail price of £5,545 or €6,637. Originally intended as a mainstream product, the marketing group turned it into a pricey special edition.

Upon its unveiling, the TAM was predicted to cost , which would include a direct-to-door concierge delivery service. At release the price was reduced to . In the middle of the machine&#x27;s sales lifespan Apple dropped the price further to around , and finally upon discontinuation in March 1998 the price was set to . Customers who paid full price for the TAM, and then complained to Apple when the price was so drastically cut, were offered a free high-end PowerBook as compensation.

== Specifications and design ==
The TAM featured a 250 MHz PowerPC 603ev processor and 12.1&quot; active matrix LCD from a PowerBook 3400c/G3 Kanga, powered by an ATI 3D Rage II video chipset with 2 MB of VRAM capable of displaying up to 16-bit color at either 800x600 or 640x480 pixels. It had a vertically mounted 4x SCSI CD-ROM and an Apple floppy SuperDrive, a 2 GB ATA hard drive, a TV/FM tuner, an S-Video input card, and a custom-made Bose sound system including two &quot;Jewel&quot; speakers and a subwoofer built into the externally located power supply &quot;base unit&quot;.

A thick &quot;umbilical&quot; cable connects the base unit to the head unit, supplying both power, and communications for the subwoofer. The umbilical connects via a multi-pin connector, which is a possible cause of the TAM&#x27;s one major fault: the &quot;speaker buzz&quot;. Inspections of units that received a repair by Apple due to the speaker buzz found one or more extra resistors had been installed in the umbilical. Ensuring the connectors are free of dust/dirt has also been known to resolve the &quot;buzz&quot;, though the buzz ultimately only affected a small percentage of machines. An Apple Engineer noted that the thick umbilical was intended to power a higher end CPU, however that option was ultimately curtailed, though the diameter of the umbilical remained.

The TAM came with a unique 75 key ADB keyboard which featured leather palm-rests and a trackpad instead of a mouse. The trackpad could be detached from the keyboard if desired, with a small leather insert found underneath the keyboard ready to fill the gap. When not required, the keyboard could slide under the TAM&#x27;s head unit, leaving the trackpad exposed for continued access. The TAM also came with a remote control (standard with the Apple TV/FM Tuner card), but also featured buttons on the front panel that could control sound levels, CD playback, brightness, contrast, and TV mode. The pre-installed operating system was a specialized version of Mac OS 7.6.1, which allowed control over those features. It is the last Macintosh model able to boot and run System 7 natively.

Expandability was offered via a 7-inch PCI slot and Apple Communication slot II for the addition of Ethernet. Later G3 upgrade options offered by Sonnet and NewerTechnologies made use of the TAM&#x27;s Level II Cache slot, which allow the computer to reach speeds of up to 500 MHz. All of these options come at the price of the TAM&#x27;s slim profile. The back panel must be removed, and replaced with an (included) &quot;hunchback&quot; cover that adds several inches to the depth of the machine.

The TAM featured a unique startup chime that was made exclusively for this model, and was not used on any other Macintosh models.

== Production and release ==
The TAM was released in the US, Japan, France, Germany, and the UK. Apple produced 12,000 units, of which 11,601 were sold and 399 were kept by Apple for use as spare parts.

Both of Apple&#x27;s founders, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, received a TAM. When &quot;Woz&quot; allowed people to see into his office via webcam in the late 1990s, his TAM was visible on his desk.

Due to the scarcity of scale, rather than training all Apple authorized technicians in repairing the TAM, Apple opted to ship faulty units to three central locations worldwide: one per continent. The US location was the Eastman Kodak Company&#x27;s service center in Rochester, New York. Apple&#x27;s Service Source CD, containing information for authorized technicians in the repair of Apple computers, lists the TAM as a &quot;closed unit&quot;, to be returned to said repair locations for all repairs. It does not contain a &quot;take apart&quot; guide for the TAM.

== Websites ==
Rather than a simple page on Apple&#x27;s website, the TAM was given its own website, albeit one of only six brief pages. This was a departure from Apple&#x27;s standard advertising practice for its other Macintosh computers of the time. The website was shut down by Apple in 1999 and redirected to the main Apple website.

Not long after the TAM&#x27;s release, a community website was created by Bob Bernardara, a TAM owner in the U.S. He created the site for TAM owners and it featured news and information about the TAM, along with links to useful software and a forum for discussions. Apple had an active link to the site shortly before the last TAM rolled was made.

Welcome to The 20th Anniversary Macintosh Web Site—the &quot;Official&quot; home of the TAM user community. This is the place where 20th Anniversary Macintosh owners can share a wealth of information on this &quot;insanely great&quot; product. The TAM (Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh) is a unique machine in the world of computers and this site will help you get the most out of yours.

The TAM site actively ran for several years and it eventually had to shut down when Bernardara could not contact Axon, the Australian hosting company who hosted the site, to make critical updates.

A number of newer TAM community websites have appeared over the years.

== Discontinuation ==
Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997. In March 1998 he made sweeping changes, including scrapping the Newton MessagePad. It was at this time that the TAM was discontinued, and remaining stocks reduced to . The timing itself was not conspicuous, most Apple computers only feature a 1-year production run, and the TAM production run began in March 1997. However, Jobs stated that he hated the TAM. Dealers in the US ran out of stock within 14 days of the final price drop.

== Reception ==
The TAM was criticized for being too expensive compared to other computers. &quot;PC World&quot; placed the TAM as 25th in their &quot;Worst Tech Products of All Time&quot; feature in 2006, citing it as one of the priciest listed personal computer with played-out specs. Furthermore, Steve Jobs reportedly disliked the TAM in 1997 before he re-joined Apple.

== Legacy ==
While the Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh may not have been a well-known machine for its time, nor a big seller, it did have a lasting influence on personal computers. Jony Ive refined the original concept of the TAM. He then became director of the Industrial Design Group, in charge of designing later computers. The LCD-based all-in-one design was revisited with the iMac G4 (2002), while the iMac G5 (2004) re-introduced the vertically mounted internal components. The removable trackpad of the TAM also shares similarities with the Magic Trackpad.

== In popular culture ==

Due to its unconventional design, the TAM has been featured in numerous films and television series, including:

* &quot;Seinfeld&quot;: Several episodes of the ninth and final season in Jerry&#x27;s apartment.
* &quot;Friends&quot;: Behind Chandler&#x27;s office desk in the fourth season, in the episode &quot;The One With the Worst Best Man Ever&quot;.
* &quot;The Real World: Seattle&quot;: Present on the desk in the Pier 70 office.
* &quot;Sabrina&quot; (1995): A prototype TAM is on the desk of Linus Larrabee. The TAM prototype sits on the far right side of Linus, on a dedicated side desk. The CD player has a see through port in the middle of the door that allows for the CD to be inserted and removed, this see through feature was removed in the production version that has a solid dark grey plastic door. The actual unit that Linus had on his desk was Apple&#x27;s in-house development model that Apple lent to the studio.
* &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997): Used by Alfred to write a CD (a capability the real computer did not have).
* &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot; (1998): The first computer Lain has is a red-colored TAM.
* &quot;Children of Men&quot; (2006): A TAM is used in Jasper&#x27;s hideout to show video feeds of intruders breaking in. In this movie it would be 30 years old, as the film is set in 2027.

<doc id="418488" wikidata="Q14950745" url="?curid=418488" title="Houston Nutt">
<text>Houston Dale Nutt Jr. (born October 14, 1957) is an American former college football coach and player. He formerly worked for CBS Sports as a college football studio analyst. Previously, he served as the head football coach at Murray State University (1993–1996), Boise State University (1997), the University of Arkansas (1998–2007), and the University of Mississippi (2008–2011). Nutt&#x27;s all-time career winning percentage is just under 59 percent.

==Early life and family==
Houston Nutt Jr. was born in Arkansas, a distant descendant of Haller Nutt and member of the Nutt family, which is prominent in Southern society. He is the son of the late Houston Dale Nutt Sr., and Emogene Nutt and is the oldest of four children. Houston Nutt Sr. briefly played basketball for the University of Kentucky under Adolph Rupp before transferring to Oklahoma A&amp;M (now Oklahoma State) in 1952. Nutt graduated from Little Rock Central High School. His parents taught at the Arkansas School for the Deaf at Little Rock, Arkansas, for 35 years. His father also served as athletic director and head basketball coach for the school. His father was inducted into the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame in 2001. During his childhood, Houston and his brothers were daily members at the Billy Mitchell Boys and Girls Club in Little Rock.

Wife Diana, like Nutt, graduated from Oklahoma State University. The couple have four children together: Houston III (born March 11, 1987), twins Hailey and Hanna (born September 26, 1988), and Haven (born March 19, 1991).

Nutt&#x27;s brother Dickey Nutt was the head basketball coach at Arkansas State University until he announced his resignation on February 19, 2008. He was also head coach at Southeast Missouri State of the OVC, before moving on to coach at Stetson University. He is now a special assistant coach at Cleveland State. His brother Danny Nutt served as the Assistant Athletics Director for Player Development at Ole Miss during Houston&#x27;s tenure as head coach. Nutt&#x27;s youngest brother Dennis Nutt, a former NBA player, is head men&#x27;s basketball coach at Ouachita Baptist University.

==College athletic career==
Nutt was the last player recruited by Arkansas head coach Frank Broyles before his retirement in 1976. Nutt was recruited as a drop-back-style quarterback and started four games as a true freshman after starting quarterback Ron Calcagni was sidelined with an injury. Nutt also played that year for the Southwest Conference champion Arkansas basketball team under coach Eddie Sutton, which went 26–2 and accomplished a 16–0 conference mark.

With the retirement of Broyles, Arkansas hired Lou Holtz as the head football coach. Holtz established an option offense that did not make use of Nutt&#x27;s passing style and relegated him to the bench as a backup.

Disappointed by his lack of playing time, Nutt transferred to Oklahoma State University and played two years as a backup quarterback. During his time at Oklahoma State, he also played for the basketball team. Nutt graduated from Oklahoma State in 1981 with a degree in physical education.

==Coaching career==

===Assistant coaching===
After graduation, Nutt became a graduate assistant at Oklahoma State under head coach Jimmy Johnson. In 1983, Nutt returned to Arkansas and became a graduate assistant coach under former coach Lou Holtz. In the spring of 1984, Nutt was hired by Arkansas State University as a full-time assistant coach, but he spent only four months there before returning to Oklahoma State that summer as a wide receivers coach.

Nutt spent six seasons as an assistant coach for receivers and quarterbacks at Oklahoma State and was promoted to offensive coordinator in 1989. During his years at Oklahoma State, he helped mentor running back Barry Sanders, who won the 1988 Heisman Trophy, and Buffalo Bills legend Thurman Thomas.
In 1990, Nutt returned to the University of Arkansas as an assistant under head coach Jack Crowe and established a reputation as an excellent recruiter. Nutt remained with the Razorbacks for three seasons and established relationships with Arkansas high school football coaches that would serve him in later years.

===Murray State===
In 1993, Nutt received his first head coaching position at NCAA Division I-AA Murray State University. The team went 4–7 and 5–6 in Nutt&#x27;s first two years.

In 1995, his efforts paid off with an 11–1 record and an Ohio Valley Conference championship after reeling off an 8–0 conference mark. Nutt received Ohio Valley Conference Coach of the Year honors and was recognized with the Eddie Robinson National Division I-AA Coach of the Year Award.

Nutt repeated his success for the 1996 season with an 11–2 record and another undefeated run through his Ohio Valley Conference schedule. Murray State won its first round Division I-AA playoff appearance, earning Nutt the OVC Coach of the Year honors and regional Coach of the Year honors.

===Boise State===
Nutt made the step up to NCAA Division I-A the next year when Boise State University hired him to take over their program, which was the lowest ranked of 112 Division I-A schools and had posted a 2–10 record the year before. Two years after making the Division I-AA finals in 1994, the Broncos had an interim head coach in 1996 as head coach Pokey Allen battled cancer. Boise State&#x27;s first year in Division I-A had been difficult; the school was looking for a recruiter and motivator to jump start their program following Allen&#x27;s death in late December.

Nutt&#x27;s team posted a 5–6 record in 1997, playing at the Division I-A level with its Division I-AA players. Nutt&#x27;s team beat rival Idaho on the road in overtime for the first Boise win in Moscow, Idaho, since 1981. Additionally, Boise State almost pulled off an upset against Wisconsin of the Big Ten.

===Arkansas===
Nutt became the head coach of the University of Arkansas Razorbacks on December 10, 1997, succeeding head coach Danny Ford. Nutt, during his first press conference as coach, immediately mentioned a national championship as his goal and felt that Arkansas had the program to win one. The Razorbacks had suffered through a low period under a succession of head coaches in the previous years, having only received two bowl game bids in the eight seasons prior to Nutt&#x27;s arrival.

Upon his arrival at Arkansas, Nutt invigorated the Razorback fan base with his enthusiasm and high energy. Under Nutt, the Razorbacks were one of three SEC schools to play in three New Year&#x27;s Day bowls within five years. Nutt&#x27;s teams were noted for a series of overtime games including the two longest overtime games in NCAA history. Off the field, some of Nutt&#x27;s players were named to the SEC Academic Honor Roll 145 times and he established a reputation as a responsible coach academically. Nutt received some criticism for a SEC win–loss record that was just barely over .500 and because he called his own offensive plays during a game instead of relying on an offensive coordinator. In his first six seasons, Nutt led the team to a bowl game each year and averaged eight wins per season.

====1998 season====
In his first season as head coach, Nutt&#x27;s Razorbacks were picked to finish last in the Southeastern Conference Western Division in 1998, but ended up with a 9–3 record and a share of the division title. The Razorbacks lost to the eventual national champion Tennessee Volunteers on Tennessee&#x27;s home field after quarterback Clint Stoerner fumbled while trying to run out the clock. For their efforts, the Razorbacks received their first-ever invitation to the Citrus Bowl and ended the season ranked No. 16 after losing to Michigan, led by junior quarterback Tom Brady. Nutt was selected as the Football News&#x27; National Coach of the Year.

====1999 season====
In 1999, Nutt&#x27;s Razorbacks were picked to win the SEC Western Division, but suffered a series of setbacks during the season. They recovered to defeat #4 ranked Tennessee, getting revenge for the loss in Knoxville the previous season due to Stoerner&#x27;s fumble, and Mississippi State to earn a Cotton Bowl Classic bid versus arch-rival Texas. The Razorbacks defeated Texas 27–6, becoming the first team to ever hold Texas to negative rushing yards in a bowl game. It was Arkansas&#x27; first bowl victory since the 1985 Holiday Bowl. The Cotton Bowl victory, which was the first college football game played in the 21st Century, propelled Arkansas into the top 20 to end the season, finishing (8-4).

====2000 season====
The 2000 season saw the Razorbacks lose the core of their team and suffer a string of injuries, including season-ending injuries to all of the starting running backs, and injuries to three of their quarterbacks. The Razorbacks struggled throughout the season until the final two games, when they defeated ranked Mississippi State and LSU teams to pull out another winning record and a Las Vegas Bowl appearance. Arkansas lost to UNLV in that game, finishing (6-6).

====2001 season====
In the 2001 season, the Razorbacks started off with a revenge victory over UNLV, but then suffered three straight losses in conference play. They then came back to win six of the last seven, including victories over ranked South Carolina and Auburn teams. Based on this performance, the Razorbacks were selected to return to the Cotton Bowl Classic to face the defending national champion Oklahoma Sooners. Arkansas lost, gaining only 50 yards of total offense and just six first downs. Nutt was named SEC coach of the year by the Associated Press and by the SEC coaches. Arkansas finished (7-5).

====2002 season====
In 2002, Nutt&#x27;s Razorbacks (9-5) stumbled midway through the season but rallied to pull together five straight wins, including a last second touchdown pass against LSU, often referred to as the &quot;Miracle on Markham&quot; to pull out a share of a Western Division title. Arkansas was defeated by the Georgia Bulldogs in the SEC Championship Game and ended the season with a loss to Minnesota in the Music City Bowl.

====2003 season====
In 2003, Nutt&#x27;s team started off with a 4–0 record including a win against #5 Texas in Austin (Arkansas&#x27; first victory at Texas since 1988). The early season success raised fan expectations sky-high and put Nutt under intense pressure when the Razorbacks lost their next three games, to include controversial losses to Auburn and Florida, putting them out of contention for the national championship or even the SEC Western Division crown. The Razorbacks won four of their final five games and defeated Missouri in the Independence Bowl to finish with a record of (9-4). After the 2003 season, Nebraska was rumored to be courting Nutt to be their head coach, after the firing of Frank Solich.

====2004 season====
The 2004 and 2005 campaigns were widely expected to be rebuilding years due to young teams. The 2004 season ended with a 5–6 record and without a bowl invitation for the first time under Nutt.

====2005 season====
The 2005 season was also a rebuilding year as expected. Tough losses to USC (70–17) as well as to Vanderbilt and South Carolina showed that the season had been predicted accurately. The team was ineligible for a bowl for the second season in a row (and the second season overall under coach Nutt). This led to Razorback fans calling for coaching changes. After meeting with Frank Broyles (athletic director) at the conclusion of the season, coaching changes were made by Nutt in the offseason at the risk of being fired, the most notable of which was the forced addition of Gus Malzahn, previously the head coach at Springdale High School in Springdale, Arkansas, as offensive coordinator. The hiring of Malzahn allowed Nutt to sign several highly recruited Springdale players, including Springdale High School quarterback Mitch Mustain and wide receiver Damian Williams, both of whom eventually transferred to USC.

====2006 season====
The 2006 season began with a new offensive coordinator in Malzahn. The Razorbacks started the season losing 50–14 in a home game to USC. Following the loss to the Trojans, Nutt announced that Mustain would replace Robert Johnson as the Hogs&#x27; starting quarterback. Mustain led Arkansas to eight straight wins, including victories against No. 22 Alabama at home and No. 2 Auburn at Auburn, before losing the starting job to Casey Dick during the South Carolina game. Dick had been slotted to start at the beginning of the season but was unable to do so because of a back injury suffered in the spring. Dick led the Razorbacks to two victories out of four for a total of 10 wins, including a win over No. 13 Tennessee in Fayetteville when ESPN&#x27;s College Gameday crew was in attendance. The Razorbacks moved to No. 7 in the BCS standings. However, the Hogs lost their last regular season game to the No. 8 LSU Tigers, 31–26. Despite the loss, the Hogs were still Western Division Champions of the SEC and played the 11–1 fourth-ranked Florida Gators for the SEC Championship. Florida won, 38–28. The Razorbacks then lost to the No. 5 Wisconsin Badgers on New Year&#x27;s Day 2007 in the Capital One Bowl, finishing the season with a (10-4) record. It was Arkansas&#x27; first 10-win season since 1989. The general consensus is that Arkansas&#x27; success in 2006 can be directly attributed to Malzahn&#x27;s play-calling and the strength of Arkansas&#x27; running game.

A highlight of the season was the second-place finish of sophomore tailback Darren McFadden in the Heisman Trophy voting. Nutt was named SEC coach of the year by the Associated Press and by the SEC coaches for the second time.

====2007 season====
The 2007 season began with the Razorbacks ranked No. 21 by the AP Poll. The Hogs opened at home with a victory over Troy. However, early losses to Alabama and Kentucky knocked Arkansas out of the rankings and made the remaining SEC schedule an uphill struggle, even with Darren McFadden, Felix Jones, and Peyton Hillis in the Razorback backfield. Fan frustration boiled over, with some fans wearing all black T-shirts with anti-Nutt statements, radicals made death threats against the Nutt family, and one fan bought an entire page in a local Little Rock newspaper calling for Nutt to be fired. A non-official flyover was made hours before the Auburn home game with a small airplane towing a banner which read: &quot;Fire Houston Nutt. Players and fans deserve better.&quot;

On November 23, 2007, in Baton Rouge, Nutt&#x27;s Razorbacks beat the #1 football team in the nation. In a game that lasted three overtimes, Arkansas defeated eventual national champion LSU Tigers, 50–48, returning the Golden Boot back to Arkansas.

Darren McFadden would finish his career at Arkansas as the school&#x27;s all-time leading rusher, was a consensus first team All-American, and finished runner-up in the Heisman voting for the second year in a row.

====Resignation====
Three days after defeating LSU, Nutt resigned as head coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks amid several controversies and rumors, which had come prior to and throughout the 2007 season. He left the school with a 75–48 record, which is second on the school&#x27;s all-time win list, behind only Broyles.
The 2007 team would go on to lose to Missouri in the 2008 Cotton Bowl Classic under interim head coach Reggie Herring, finishing (8-5).

===Ole Miss===
On November 27, 2007, Nutt was hired as the new head coach of the Ole Miss Rebels, replacing former head coach Ed Orgeron, who was fired after three consecutive losing seasons. Nutt&#x27;s move to Ole Miss served to stoke the long-standing Arkansas–Ole Miss football rivalry.

It was announced on April 16, 2009, that Nutt and his wife, Diana, had committed to give a gift of $100,000 to Ole Miss, evenly divided between the university&#x27;s indoor practice facility and the creation of student-athlete scholarships.

====2008 season====

After a 41–24 victory over border rival Memphis to open the season, the Rebels suffered a loss to the then-ranked Wake Forest Demon Deacons, 30–28, on a last-second field goal. After defeating Samford, Ole Miss lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores at home. After the loss, the Rebels traveled to Ben Hill Griffin Stadium in Gainesville, Florida, where they defeated the #4-ranked, and eventual national champion, Florida Gators, 31–30, after blocking Florida&#x27;s attempt at a tying extra point and a defensive stop of Florida quarterback Tim Tebow on 4th-and-1. The next weekend, the Rebels lost to South Carolina.

Next on the schedule was Alabama, ranked No. 2 in the nation at the time. During the game, Ole Miss became the first team Alabama trailed in the 2008 season. Alabama ultimately prevailed, however, in the final series of the game, winning, 24–20. Then came Arkansas. Nutt, facing his old team, came out victorious, 23–21. The Rebels followed that with a 17–7 home win against Auburn. On November 15, Ole Miss beat ULM, 59–0, to push their record to 6–4 and become bowl eligible for the first time since 2003. Ole Miss next beat No. 8 LSU, 31–13, in Baton Rouge, snapping a six-game losing streak to the Tigers, earning the Rebels an Associated Press ranking of No. 25, the first time in four years Ole Miss had been ranked, and putting them in position for a possible bid to the Cotton Bowl Classic in Dallas, Texas. The Rebels went on to beat SEC West and in-state rival Mississippi State, 45–0, in the Egg Bowl to finish the regular season at 8–4. The win over the Bulldogs moved the Rebels up to No. 22 in the AP Poll and landed the team their first ranking of the year in the Coaches&#x27; Poll, coming in at No. 25. Ole Miss defeated the No. 7 Texas Tech Red Raiders, 47–34, in the Cotton Bowl Classic.

====2009 season====

The Ole Miss Rebels began the 2009 season rated highly by the media. After beating Memphis, 45–14, and Southeastern Louisiana, 52–6, which gave Ole Miss the second longest winning streak in the nation at eight games dating back to the 2008 season, Ole Miss climbed as high as No. 4 in the AP Poll before losing their 2009 SEC opener, 16–10, on the road at South Carolina in a Thursday night game on September 24. After the loss, Ole Miss fell 17 spots in the AP Poll, down to No. 21. Ole Miss went on the road again and beat Vanderbilt the next week, 23–7. After a disappointing start and pair of conference losses, they managed to rebound against Arkansas, winning 30–17. Ole Miss went on to beat No. 8 LSU, 25–23, at Oxford. Ole Miss lost to in-state and SEC rival Mississippi State on November 28 in the Egg Bowl at Starkville, 41–27. Ole Miss was picked to play in the Cotton Bowl Classic for the second year in a row, where they defeated Oklahoma State, 21–7, to end the season.

=====The Houston Nutt Rule=====
Nutt recruited 37 players in February 2010, leading the SEC to enact the Houston Nutt Rule: effective August 1, 2010, &quot;SEC teams will be limited to signing 28 football recruits, with the usual maximum of 25 allowed to enroll in the fall.&quot;

ESPN recruiting analyst Tom Luginbill said:

====2010 season====

The Ole Miss Rebels finished 4–8 overall in the 2010 season, including 1–7 in the Southeastern Conference. Among the worst of these losses was to FCS-member Jacksonville State, which was Ole Miss&#x27; first loss to a lower division team since 1945. In an ironic twist, the head coach of Jacksonville State at the time was Jack Crowe, who was fired by athletic director Frank Broyles one game into the 1992 season as head coach at Arkansas, after a season-opening loss to FCS-member The Citadel. Houston Nutt was an assistant on Crowe&#x27;s staff at that time. Nutt and Ole Miss lost to Arkansas this season, 38-24, and many Razorback fans jeered Nutt after the game.

All four victories were vacated in 2019 as punishment for recruiting violations committed by members of Nutt&#x27;s staff, leaving the team officially winless. It was Ole Miss&#x27; first winless record in modern times.

====2011 season====

Nutt set an Ole Miss coaching record with his 12th straight Southeastern Conference loss. On November 7, 2011, Nutt was fired by the University of Mississippi, but was allowed to coach through the end of the season. His final game was a 31–3 loss to Mississippi State in the annual Egg Bowl. Nutt also lost for the second straight year to his former team, the University of Arkansas, as the Razorbacks held on for a 29–24 victory in Oxford.
Ole Miss finished winless in conference play.

Two wins in non-conference play were vacated in 2019 as punishment for recruiting violations committed by members of Nutt&#x27;s staff, leaving the team officially winless.

==Allegations of misconduct in recruiting==
In January 2016, the NCAA notified Nutt&#x27;s former university, Mississippi, of 13 compliance violations alleged to have occurred under both Nutt and then-head coach Hugh Freeze. Nutt was alleged to have cheated by allowing ineligible students to play in Ole Miss games in 2011 and 2012. However, Nutt filed suit against Ole Miss, and the suit was later settled with the university and Nutt issuing this official statement:
&quot;Certain statements made by University employees in January 2016 appear to have contributed to misleading media reports about Coach Nutt. To the extent any such statements harmed Coach Nutt’s reputation, the University apologizes, as this was not the intent. The NCAA’s Notice of Allegations dated January 22, 2016, did not name or implicate Coach Nutt in any misconduct, and it would have been inappropriate for any University employee to suggest otherwise.&quot; Apparently, two assistants under Nutt had conspired to fix certain players&#x27; ACT scores to make them eligible to play and those assistants under Nutt were found guilty of academic fraud. These were the only two violations which occurred under Nutt&#x27;s administration; of the 21 total NCAA findings, the remaining 19 violations were under Freeze&#x27;s administration.

<text>XSIL (Extensible Scientific Interchange Language) is an XML-based transport language for scientific data, supporting the inclusion of both in-file data and metadata. The language comes with an extensible Java object model. The language&#x27;s elementary objects include Param (arbitrary association between a keyword and a value), Array, Table (a set of column headings followed by a set of records), and Stream, which enables one to either encapsulate data inside the XSIL file or point to an external data source.

<doc id="418508" wikidata="Q76938" url="?curid=418508" title="August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben">
<text>August Heinrich Hoffmann (, calling himself von Fallersleben, after his hometown; 2 April 179819 January 1874) was a German poet. He is best known for writing &quot;&quot;, whose third stanza is now the national anthem of Germany, and a number of popular children&#x27;s songs, considered part of the Young Germany movement.

== Biography ==
Hoffmann was born in Fallersleben in Lower Saxony, then in the duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg.
The son of a merchant and mayor of his native city, he was educated at the classical schools of Helmstedt and Braunschweig, and afterwards at the universities of Göttingen and Bonn. His original intention was to study theology, but he soon devoted himself entirely to literature. In 1823 he was appointed custodian of the university library at Breslau, a post which he held till 1838. He was also made extraordinary professor of the German language and literature at that university in 1830, and ordinary professor in 1835. Hoffmann was deprived of his chair in 1842 in consequence of his &quot;Unpolitische Lieder&quot; (1840–1841, &quot;Unpolitical Songs&quot;), which gave much offence to the authorities in Prussia.

During his exile, he traveled in Germany, Switzerland and Italy, and lived for two or three years in Mecklenburg, of which he became a naturalized citizen. After the revolution of 1848 he was enabled to return to Prussia, where he was restored to his rights, and received the salary attached to a promised office not yet vacant. He married in 1849, and during the next ten years lived first in Bingerbrück, afterwards in Neuwied, and then in Weimar, where together with Oskar Schade (1826–1906) he edited the &quot;Weimarische Jahrbuch&quot; (1854–1857).

In 1860 he was appointed librarian to Victor I, Duke of Ratibor at the monasterial castle of Corvey near Höxter on the Weser, where he died in 1874.

== Works ==
Hoffmann von Fallersleben was one of the most popular poets of his time. In politics he ardently sympathized with progressive tendencies, and he was among the earliest and most effective of the political poets who paved the way for the revolution of 1848. As a poet, however, he acquired distinction chiefly by the ease, simplicity and grace with which he gave expression to the passions and aspirations of daily life. Although he had not been academically trained in music, he composed melodies for many of his songs, and a considerable number of them are sung by all classes in every part of Germany.

Among the best known is the patriotic &quot;&quot; which starts with the words &quot;Deutschland, Deutschland über alles&quot; and is set to a 1797 tune by Joseph Haydn. The lyrics were written in 1841 on the island of Helgoland, then in British possession. The text of the song expresses the pan-German sentiments common to revolutionary republicans of the period, which were considered inflammatory and treasonous in the German-speaking principalities. The phrase &quot;über alles&quot; at that time did not refer to militant ideas of conquest of foreign countries, but to the need for loyalty to a united Germany above regional loyalties.

The best of Hoffmann von Fallersleben&#x27;s poetical writings is his &quot;Gedichte&quot; (&quot;Poems&quot;, 1827), but there is great merit also in his other works:
* &quot;Alemannische Lieder&quot; (&quot;Alemannic Songs&quot;, 1826),
* &quot;Soldatenleben&quot; (&quot;Soldier&#x27;s Life&quot;, 1852),
* &quot;Rheinleben&quot; (&quot;Rhine Life&quot;, 1865), and in his
* &quot;Fünfzig neue Kinderlieder&quot; (&quot;Fifty New Children&#x27;s Songs&quot;), and
* &quot;Alte und neue Kinder&quot; (&quot;Old and New Children&#x27;s Songs&quot;).

Many of his children&#x27;s songs are still popular, and are known by nearly every German child, including &quot;Alle Vögel sind schon da&quot;, &quot;Ein Männlein steht im Walde&quot;, &quot;Summ, summ, summ&quot;, &quot;Winters Abschied&quot; (&quot;Winter ade, scheiden tut weh&quot;), &quot;Kuckuck, Kuckuck, ruft&#x27;s aus dem Wald&quot;, &quot;Der Kuckuck und der Esel&quot;, &quot;A, a, a, der Winter der ist da&quot;, &quot;Der Frühling hat sich eingestellt&quot;, and the Christmas song &quot;Morgen kommt der Weihnachtsmann&quot;. Other composers, including Amalie Scholl and Pauline Volkstein, set Hoffmann von Fallersleben&#x27;s text to music.

Hoffmann von Fallersleben&#x27;s &quot;Unpolitische Lieder&quot; (&quot;Apolitical songs&quot;), &quot;Deutsche Lieder aus der Schweiz&quot; (&quot;German Songs from Switzerland&quot;) and &quot;Streiflichter&quot; (&quot;Highlights&quot;) are interesting mainly in relation to the movements of the age in which they were written. As a student of ancient Teutonic literature, Hoffmann von Fallersleben ranks among the most persevering and cultivated of German scholars. Some of his findings are embodied in his &quot;Horae Belgicae&quot; (&quot;Belgian hours&quot;), &quot;Fundgruben für Geschichte deutscher Sprache und Literatur&quot; (&quot;Sources for the History of German Language and Literature&quot;), &quot;Altdeutsche Blätter&quot; (&quot;Old German Papers&quot;), and &quot;Spenden zur deutschen Literaturgeschichte und Findlinge&quot; (&quot;Contributions to German literary history and finds&quot;).

His editions of historic works include: 
* &quot;Reineke Vos&quot;,
* &quot;Monumenta Elnonensia&quot; and
* &quot;Theophilus&quot;.

&quot;Die deutsche Philologie im Grundriss&quot; (&quot;Fundamentals of German Philology&quot;, 1836) was at the time of its publication a valuable contribution to philological research, and historians of German literature still attach importance to his 
* &quot;Geschichte des deutschen Kirchenliedes bis auf Luther&quot; (&quot;History of the German Church Song up to Luther&quot;, 1832; 3rd ed.: 1861);
* &quot;Unsere volkstümlichen Lieder&quot; (&quot;Our Folk Songs&quot;, 3rd ed.: 1869) and
* &quot;Die deutschen Gesellschaftslieder des 16. und 17. Jahrh.&quot; (&quot;German Society Songs of the 16th and 17th Centuries&quot;, 2nd ed.: 1860).

In 1868–1870, Hoffmann published an autobiography in six volumes, &quot;Mein Leben: Aufzeichnungen und Erinnerungen&quot; (&quot;My Life: Notes and Memories&quot;; abbreviated ed. in 2 vols.: 1894). His &quot;Gesammelte Werke&quot; (&quot;Collected Works&quot;) in 8 volumes were edited by H. Gerstenberg (1891–1894); his &quot;Ausgewählte Werke&quot; (&quot;Selected Works&quot;) in 4 volumes by H. Benzmann (1905).

<text>The mullets or grey mullets are a family (Mugilidae) of ray-finned fish found worldwide in coastal temperate and tropical waters, and some species in fresh water. Mullets have served as an important source of food in Mediterranean Europe since Roman times. The family includes about 78 species in 26 genera.

Mullets are distinguished by the presence of two separate dorsal fins, small triangular mouths, and the absence of a lateral line organ. They feed on detritus, and most species have unusually muscular stomachs and a complex pharynx to help in digestion.

==Classification and naming==


Taxonomically, the family is currently treated as the sole member of the order Mugiliformes, but as Nelson says, &quot;there has been much disagreement concerning the relationships&quot; of this family. The presence of fin spines clearly indicates membership in the superorder Acanthopterygii, and in the 1960s, they were classed as primitive perciforms, while others have grouped them in Atheriniformes. They are classified as an order, Mugiliformes, within the subseries Ovalentaria of the clade Percomorpha in the 5th Edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot;.

In North America, &quot;mullet&quot; by itself usually refers to Mugilidae. In Europe, the word &quot;mullet&quot; is usually qualified, the &quot;grey mullets&quot; being Mugilidae and the &quot;red mullets&quot; or &quot;surmullets&quot; being Mullidae, notably members of the genus &quot;Mullus&quot;. Outside Europe, the Mullidae are often called &quot;goatfish&quot;. Fish with common names including the word &quot;mullet&quot; may be a member of one family or the other, or even unrelated such as the freshwater &quot;Catostomus commersonii&quot;.

However, recent taxonomic work has reorganised the family and the following genera make up the Mugilidae:
* &quot;Agonostomus&quot; 
* &quot;Aldrichetta&quot; 
* &quot;Cestraeus&quot; 
* &quot;Chaenomugil&quot; 
* &quot;Chelon&quot; 
* &quot;Crenimugil&quot; 
* &quot;Dajaus&quot; 
* &quot;Ellochelon&quot; 
* &quot;Gracilimugil&quot; 
* &quot;Joturus&quot; 
* &quot;Minimugil&quot; 
* &quot;Mugil&quot; 
* &quot;Myxus&quot; 
* &quot;Neomyxus&quot; 
* &quot;Neochelon&quot; 
* &quot;Oedalechilus&quot; 
* &quot;Osteomugil&quot; 
* &quot;Parachelon&quot; 
* &quot;Paramugil&quot; 
* &quot;Planiliza&quot; 
* &quot;Plicomugil&quot; 
* &quot;Pseudomyxus&quot; 
* &quot;Rhinomugil&quot; 
* &quot;Sicamugil&quot; 
* &quot;Squalomugil&quot; 
* &quot;Trachystoma&quot; 
== Behaviour ==
A common noticeable behaviour in mullet is the tendency to leap out of the water. There are two distinguishable types of leaps: a straight, clean slice out of the water to escape predators and a slower, lower jump while turning to its side that results in a larger, more distinguishable, splash. The reasons for this lower jump are disputed, but have been hypothesised to be in order to gain oxygen rich air for gas exchange in a small organ above the pharynx.

== Development ==
The ontogeny of mugilid larvae has been well studied, with the larval development of &quot;Mugil cephalus&quot; in particular being studied intensively due to its wide range of distribution and interest to aquaculture. The previously understudied osteological development of &quot;Mugil cephalus&quot; was investigated in a 2021 study, with four embryonic and six larval developmental steps being described in aquaculture-reared and wild-caught specimens. These descriptions provided clarification of questionable characters of adult mullets and revealed informative details with potential implications for phylogenetic hypotheses, as well as providing an overdue basis of comparison for aquaculture-reared mullets to enable recognition of malformations.

<text>The mullet is a hairstyle in which the hair is cut shorter at the front, top and sides, but is longer at the back.

==Etymology==
According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, use of the term &quot;mullet&quot; to describe this hairstyle was &quot;apparently coined, and certainly popularized, by American hip-hop group the Beastie Boys&quot;, who used &quot;mullet&quot; and &quot;mullet head&quot; as epithets in their 1994 song &quot;Mullet Head&quot;, combining it with a description of the haircut: &quot;number one on the side and don&#x27;t touch the back, number six on the top and don&#x27;t cut it wack, Jack.&quot; They expounded on the subject at length in a six-page article entitled &quot;Mulling Over The Mullet&quot; in Issue 2 (1995) of their magazine Grand Royal, offering a selection of alternative names for the cut, including &quot;Hockey Player Haircut&quot; and &quot;Soccer Rocker&quot;.

===False etymology===
On &quot;Slate&quot; &quot;Decoder Ring&quot; podcast, Willa Paskin discussed the etymology of the term, noting that Oxford English Dictionary credited the Australian &quot;Street Machine&quot; automotive magazine with the first published description of the term in 1992, predating Beastie Boys. &quot;Decoder Ring&quot; discovered that the magazine image had been faked; in a 2018 apology posted to imgur, the creator had admitted to faking the text, adjusting the magazine dates, and shown proof.

==Fashion history==
=== In antiquity ===
Historian Suetonius writes that the Roman emperor Tiberius &quot;wore his hair rather long at the back, so much so as even to cover the nape of his neck&quot;, and that this was a tradition of his family, the Claudians. One bust of Tiberius&#x27;s great-nephew Caligula has short locks across the forehead and longer hair behind.

A metal figurine, dated back to the 1st-century AD and found during 2018 preparations for a new car park at the Wimpole Estate, England, was hypothesised by archaeologists to indicate that natives in ancient Britain during the Roman occupation could have worn their hair similarly to mullets.

In the sixth century, Byzantine scholar Procopius wrote that some factions of young males wore their hair long at the back and cut it short over the forehead. This non-Roman style was termed the &quot;Hunnic&quot; look.

Researcher Alan Henderson describes the ancient hairstyle as useful, as it kept the hair out of the eyes, yet provided warmth and protection for the neck.

===Native America===
In &quot;Mourt&#x27;s Relation&quot;, author Edward Winslow described the Plymouth pilgrims&#x27; first encounter with the Native Americans, Samoset of the Abenaki in 1621:

===Native Borneo===
Some tribes in Borneo also have mullet hairstyles, including Dayak Kayan, Kenyah and Iban.

===1960s===
Tom Jones sported a mullet in two of his three 1965 performances of his hit song &quot;It&#x27;s Not Unusual&quot; on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, May 2, 1965 and June 13, 1965.

===1970s===

Mullets were worn by rock stars David Bowie, Rod Stewart, Keith Richards, and Paul McCartney in the early 1970s. When writing Neil Peart&#x27;s eulogy in January 2020, Greg Prato asserted Peart had a mullet, based on his observations of a 1974 video, further suggesting &quot;he also may have been one of the first rockers to sport another hairstyle – the rattail&quot;, based on a 1985 video, &quot;The Big Money&quot;.

===1980s===

In Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s, mullets were &quot;everywhere&quot;, according to Tess Reidy writing at &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2019. The 1980s were also the high point of the mullet&#x27;s popularity in continental Europe.

Also in the 1980s, the mullet became part of lesbian culture, where it came to be used as a way of identifying oneself as a member of that culture in public.

===1990s===

After the much-publicized 1992 DC Comics storyline in which Superman apparently died, the character returned to the 1993 follow-up storyline &quot;Reign of the Supermen&quot;, in which he was depicted with a mullet. The cancelled Superman film project, &quot;Superman Lives&quot;, would have depicted Superman with a mullet.

Punk rock band the Vandals sang of the mullets worn by country music singers and guests of &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot; and listed regional names for the style in the 1998 song &quot;I&#x27;ve Got an Ape Drape&quot;. In 1997, gay punk band Pansy Division released their single &quot;Hockey Hair&quot; in Vancouver, Canada about this hairstyle.

Vocalist Wesley Willis wrote and released the track &quot;Cut the Mullet&quot; in 1998 and frequently performed it at live shows.

===2000s===
The 2001 film &quot;American Mullet&quot; documents the phenomenon of the mullet hairstyle and the people who wear it.

The same year Universal Records (Canada) released the album &quot;Mullet Years: Power Ballads&quot;, a collection of hard rock ballads.

This hairstyle became popular with the bogan subculture in Australia and New Zealand.

=== 2010s ===
The mullet was banned in Iran as one style on a list of &quot;un-Islamic&quot;, &quot;decadent Western cuts&quot;.

The mullet was returned to the spotlight in 2015 by K-pop idol G-Dragon during his band BIGBANG&#x27;s Made World Tour. Baekhyun of EXO also sported a mullet in promotion for the group&#x27;s 2017 song &quot;Ko Ko Bop&quot;. K-pop artists who have worn mullets include Block B&#x27;s Zico, Song Min-ho, Nam Joo-hyuk, Dean, Stray Kids&#x27; Chan and Han, VIXX&#x27;s N, B.A.P.&#x27;s Himchan, Seventeen&#x27;s Woozi and The8, and BTS&#x27;s V.

The mullet has also experienced a revival within American sports. After winning back-to-back Stanley Cups, Phil Kessel was spotted in Pittsburgh Penguins training camp in September 2017 bringing the mullet back to its native roots of Pittsburgh hockey (Jaromír Jágr wore a mullet with the Penguins in the 1990s). Similarly, Oklahoma State head football coach Mike Gundy wore a mullet starting in early 2017; the popularity of his mullet supposedly earned Oklahoma State millions of dollars in marketing revenue. In addition, from 2010 to 2015, Patrick Kane of the Chicago Blackhawks popularized the &quot;playoff mullet,&quot; an alternative to the traditional NHL playoff beard. Then-Pittsburgh Steelers running back James Conner began sporting a mullet in 2018, continuing the Yinzer tradition of the hairstyle in Western Pennsylvania. The revival also extended to Australia in the late 2010s, with Australian soccer player Rhyan Grant becoming widely known for his mullet haircut to the point that it was included within the video game FIFA 20.

=== 2020s ===
In September 2020, i-D called 2020 &quot;the year of the mullet&quot;, attributing its boom in popularity to COVID-19 lockdowns and the extended closure of hair salons. In an article for Vice Media, the mullet-wearing teenagers interviewed all described getting the haircut as a joke, with one stating &quot;There&#x27;s an irony to the mullet haircut. It&#x27;s this disgustingly gross haircut, which means it&#x27;s definitely worn in an ironic way&quot;. Magda Ryczko, founder of a barbershop in Brooklyn, notes that mullets allow for a professional front-facing look for COVID-19 era Zoom meetings, while maintaining a messier, more fun look off-camera, when the longer back section of hair may be revealed. An annual national USA Mullet Championship began in 2020. The versatility of the taper fade has modernized the classic mullet, giving it a cleaner look, known as the modern mullet.

In July 2023, Mexican singer Peso Pluma attracted attention for his mullet style, a hairstyle that he adopted as his signature haircut during his stardom as a musical performer. The singer confirmed that his hairstyle was originally a mishap, when he visited the city of Medellín and his barber gave him a hairstyle that was &quot;popular in Medellín&quot;, later realizing that it wasn&#x27;t bad after filming a music video. 

58-year-old Tami Manis from Knoxville, Tennessee was awarded a Guinness World Record for a mullet in August 2023, a result of not having her hair cut for 33 years.

In September 2024, 26-year old Trevor Hyland, of Shrule in County Mayo, Ireland, gained the nickname &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Mullet&quot; after finding himself representing Ireland in a Swiss competition to find the greatest example of the hairstyle. A win might see him representing Ireland at European level.

==In popular culture ==
In 2019, Kiefer Sutherland described himself as an unwitting instigator of the hairstyle, which he sported in the 1987 film &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;. In 2022 press interviews marking the 35th anniversary of the film, Sutherland again recounted the story.

<text>In heraldry, the term star may refer to any star-shaped charge with any number of rays, which may appear straight or wavy, and may or may not be pierced. While there has been much confusion between the two due to their similar shape, a star with straight-sided rays is usually called a mullet in English heraldry while one with wavy rays is usually called an estoile.

While a mullet may have any number of &quot;points&quot;, it is presumed to have five unless otherwise specified in the blazon, and pierced mullets are common; estoiles, however, are presumed to have six &quot;rays&quot; and (as of 1909) had not been found pierced. In Scottish heraldry, an estoile is the same as in English heraldry, but &quot;mullet&quot; refers only to a mullet pierced (also called a &quot;spur revel&quot;), while one that is not pierced is called a star.

== Terminology ==
The use of the word &quot;star&quot; in blazons, and how that charge appears in coat armory, varies from one jurisdiction to another. 
In Scots heraldry, both &quot;star&quot; and &quot;mullet&quot; interchangeably mean a star with five straight rays; 
the official record from 1673 gives Murray of Ochtertyre &quot;azur three Starrs argent ...&quot; (Public Register, vol 1 p 188), while the Ordinary of Arms produced by a late 19th century Lyon King of Arms &#x27;modernizes&#x27; the original as &quot;Az. three mullets arg. ...&quot;. In Canadian heraldry the usual term is &quot;mullet&quot;, but there is also the occasional six-pointed &quot;star&quot; (e.g. in Vol. IV, at p. 274 and in online version of the Canadian Public Register), which is what others would blazon as a six-pointed &quot;mullet&quot;. The United States Army Institute of Heraldry, the official heraldic authority in the United States, uses the term &quot;mullet&quot; in its blazons, but elsewhere, as in US government documents describing the flag of the United States and the Great Seal of the United States, the term &quot;star&quot; is constantly used, and these nearly always appear with five straight-sided points.

The term &quot;mullet&quot; or &quot;molet&quot; refers to a star with straight sides, typically having five or six points, 
but may have any number of points specified in the blazon. If the number of points is not specified, five points are presumed in Gallo-British heraldry, and six points are presumed in German-Nordic heraldry.
Unlike estoiles, mullets have straight (rather than wavy) rays and may have originally represented the rowel of a spur, rather than a celestial star. 
The term is said to be derived from French &quot;molette&quot;, a spur-rowel, although it was in use in heraldry even before rowel spurs.

The term &quot;estoile&quot; refers to wavy-sided stars, usually of six points, though they may also be blazoned with a different number of points, often eight (e.g. &quot;Portsmouth County Council&quot; pictured here ), and many variants feature alternating straight and wavy rays (e.g. &quot;Honford&quot; pictured here). The term derives from Old French &quot;estoile&quot; &#x27;star&#x27;, in reference to a celestial star (cf. Modern French &quot;étoile&quot;), from Latin &quot;stella&quot; &#x27;star&#x27;.

== Classical heraldry ==

Stars are comparatively rare in European heraldry during the medieval period. An early reference of dubious historicity is reported by Johannes Letzner, who cites &quot;Conradus Fontanus&quot; (an otherwise unknown authority) to the effect that one Curtis von Meinbrechthausen, a knight of Saxony, in 1169 after committing a murder lost his rank and arms, described as an eight-pointed star beneath a chevron.
In Scotland, the armigers of Clan Murray and Clan Douglas used arms with stars as early as the 12th or 13th century.
Examples of stars in a late medieval heraldry of the Holy Roman Empire include those of Wentz von Niederlanstein (1350), Gemm (attested 1352), Geyer von Osterberg (1370), Enolff Ritter von Leyen (d. 1392).

Under the system of cadency in use in England and Ireland since the late 15th century, a third son bears a mullet (unpierced) as a difference.

Stars become much more popular as heraldic charges in the early modern era, especially in then-recent family coats of arms of burghers and patricians, as well as in coats of arms of cities (e.g. Maastricht, Bozen, Kaufbeuren).
The coat of arms of Valais originates in the 16th century, when seven stars representing its &quot;Seven Tithings&quot; were added to the &quot;party per pale&quot; coat of arms of the Bishop of Sion.
Of the higher nobility in Siebmachers Wappenbuch (1605), the landgrave of Hessen and the counts of Waldeck and Erbach have stars in their coats of arms, as do several Swiss knights.

==By country==
===Italy===

The &quot;Stella d&#x27;Italia&quot; (&quot;Star of Italy&quot;), popularly known as &quot;Stellone d&#x27;Italia&quot; (&quot;Great Star of Italy&quot;), is a five-pointed white star, which has symbolized Italy for many centuries. It is the oldest national symbol of Italy, since it dates back to Graeco-Roman mythology when Venus, associated with the West as an evening star, was adopted to identify the Italian peninsula. From an allegorical point of view, the &quot;Stella d&#x27;Italia&quot; metaphorically represents the shining destiny of Italy.

In the early 16th century it began to be frequently associated with &quot;Italia turrita&quot;, the national personification of the Italian peninsula. The &quot;Stella d&#x27;Italia&quot; was adopted as part of the emblem of Italy in 1947, where it is superimposed on a steel cogwheel, all surrounded by an oak branch and an olive branch. From an allegorical point of view, the Star of Italy metaphorically represents the shining destiny of Italy. Its unifying value is equal to that of the flag of Italy. In 1947, the &quot;Stella d&#x27;Italia&quot; was inserted at the center of the emblem of Italy, which was designed by Paolo Paschetto and which is the iconic symbol identifying the Italian State.

The Italian Star is also recalled by some honors. The Italian Star is recalled by the Colonial Order of the Star of Italy, decoration of the Kingdom of Italy which was intended to celebrate the Italian Empire, as well as by the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity, the first decoration established by Republican Italy, which was replaced in 2011 by the Order of the Star of Italy, second civil honorary title in importance of the Italian State. The Star of Italy is also recalled by the stars worn on the collars of Italian military uniforms and appears on the figurehead of the Italian Navy. In the civil sphere, the Italian Star is the central symbol of the emblem of the Club Alpino Italiano.

The symbolism of a star associated with Italy first appeared in the writings of the ancient Greek poet Stesicoro, from whom it passed on to poets such as Virgil. The oldest national symbol of Italy, it originated from the combination of Venus, as an evening star, with the West and therefore with the Italian peninsula, one of which was &quot;Esperia&quot;, or &quot;land of Hesperus, the star of the Evening consecrated to Venus&quot;. This symbolism was already attested in archaic Greek literature, in 6th century BC by the poet Stesichorus, in the poem &quot;Iliupersis (Fall of Troy)&quot; that created the legend of Aeneas which described his return to the land of his ancestors (Italy) after the defeat of Troy, under the leadership of Venus.

=== United States ===

Stars are nearly ubiquitous in United States heraldry and vexillology and nearly always appear unpierced with five straight-sided points. In the flag of the United States, each star represents one state. The flag adopted in 1777 is the attributed origin of the thirteen stars, representing the thirteen United States, appearing on the Great Seal since 1780.

A mullet &quot;barbed to chief&quot; appears in the arms of the 240th Signal Battalion of the 40th Infantry Division of the California Army National Guard United States Army.

== Modern use ==

In the design of modern flags and emblems, the stars (mullets, usually five-pointed) when standing alone often represent concepts like &quot;unity&quot; or &quot;independence&quot;. When arranged in groups, they often enumerate provinces or other components of the nation (such as ethnic groups). In the flags of Nauru and the Marshall Islands, this enumeration is done by the points of a single star rather than by multiple number of stars.

Some flags of countries on the southern hemisphere show a depiction of the Southern Cross consisting of four or five stars.
The star and crescent symbol is found in flags of states succeeding the Ottoman Empire, which used flags with this symbol during 1793-1923.

The twelve stars on the Flag of Europe (1955) symbolize unity.

The green five-pointed star on the Esperanto flag (1890) symbolizes the five inhabited continents.

The 50 stars of the US flag is the largest number on any national flag. The second-largest is 27, on the flag of Brazil.

The current national flags featuring stars include:

Not bearing heraldic stars as such, the 1915 Flag of Morocco and the 1996 flag of Ethiopia have a pentagram each, and the 1948 flag of Israel a hexagram or &quot;star of David&quot;.
The 1962 Flag of Nepal has what would technically be described as a 12-pointed mullet, but is intended to depict the Sun.

<doc id="418516" wikidata="Q72931" url="?curid=418516" title="Weser Uplands">
<text>The Weser Uplands (German: &quot;Weserbergland&quot;, ) is a hill region in Germany, between Hannoversch Münden and Porta Westfalica, along the river Weser. The area reaches into three states, Lower Saxony, Hesse, and North Rhine-Westphalia. Important towns of this region include Bad Karlshafen, Holzminden, Höxter, Bodenwerder, Hameln, Rinteln, and Vlotho.

The tales of the Brothers Grimm are set in the Weser Uplands, and it has many renaissance buildings, exhibiting a peculiar regional style, the Weser Renaissance style. The region roughly coincides with the natural region of the Lower Saxon Hills defined by the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN).

== Geography ==


In addition to the whole of the Weser Valley between Hann. Münden und Porta Westfalica, several geologically associated, but clearly separate chains of uplands, ridges and individual hills are considered part of the Weser Uplands. In its narrowest sense, the following would be included (running from north to south):
The largest contiguous area of forest in the Weser Uplands lies on the Solling in the Solling-Vogler Nature Park. Its woods stretch southwards as far as the Reinardswald (on left bank of the Weser) and Bramwald (right bank), interrupted only by the island-like Uslar Basin and the narrow Weser valley. Even on the far side of the rivers Fulda and Werra - and thus beyond the Weser Uplands - the dense forest continues further south without significant interruption to the Kaufungen Forest.

=== Notable ridges ===
In addition to the aforementioned core ridges, other ranges and ridges are also sometimes considered part of the Weser Uplands. These mainly include the following (with maximum elevations given in metres above sea level (NN):
The last major changes to the landscape were made during the course of the ice ages by the glacial advances of the Scandinavian ice sheet which gave rise to much of Germany&#x27;s present-day Northern Lowland.


== Important towns ==
== Culture==
The Weser Uplands once developed its own style of architecture. Between 1520 and 1640 a great number of buildings were built in the so-called Weser Renaissance style.

Characters from the area who have achieved international renown include the legendary Pied Piper of Hamelin, the &quot;Lying Baron&quot;, Baron Munchausen, whose real-life inspiration came from Bodenwerder, and Doctor Eisenbarth who died in Hann. Münden.

In addition, many fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm were set in the region, for example, Snow White, which is supposed to have taken place in Alfeld, Rapunzel, who let down her long hair for her prince from a tower at Trendelburg Castle, or Sleeping Beauty, whose castle was based on the now ruined Sababurg near Hofgeismar.

== Artistic reception ==
The picturesque landscape of the Weser Uplands has inspired many landscape painters and artists: Jacob Pins (1917–2005), Robert Batty, Christian Andreas Besemann, Carl Ferdinand Fabritius, Robert Geißler, Wolfgang Heinrich, Karl Arthur Held, Alfred Hesse, Rudolf Jahns, Herbert Mager, Anton Wilhelm Strack (1758–1829), Pascha Johann Friedrich Weitsch and August Wenderoth.

== Tourism ==

The more significant tourist destinations in the region, in addition to the historic towns mentioned above are the Weser Uplands Schaumburg-Hamelin Nature Park, the Solling-Vogler Nature Park, the roughly 500 kilometre long-distance cycle path, the &quot;Weser Cycleway&quot; along the River Weser.
A botanic feature are the rare Dwarf Beech trees (&quot;Süntelbuchen&quot;).

Of increasing importance is motorcycle tourism. The Weser Uplands, like the Harz, is a popular motorcycle destination in northern Germany. In particular, the Köterberg, as the highest elevation from that point to the North Sea, is a popular motorcycle meeting point with a magnificent panoramic view up to 80 kilometres.

Other notable attractions are the Schillat Cave, the Tonenburg in Höxter-Albaxen, the Neuhaus Wildlife Park, the Weserstein in Hann. Münden and several museums such as the Agricultural Technology Museum in Börry, the hammer mill in Dassel, The German Huguenot Museum in Bad Karlshafen and the Motorcycle Museum in Wickensen.

== Economy ==
The region is heavily influenced by tourism. Large areas are also utilized by agriculture and forestry and firms involved in processing the products of these industries, such as sawmills. A porcelain factory in Fürstenberg has been working since 1747.

<text>Padbury is a village and civil parish in north Buckinghamshire, England. It is located on the A413 main road that links Buckingham with Winslow.

==History==
The village name is Old English in origin, and means &#x27;Padda&#x27;s fortress&#x27;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was recorded as &quot;Pateberie&quot;. The Manor of Padbury was exchanged, around the time of the Norman Conquest, for the Manor of Iver between Robert Doyley and Robert Clarenbold of the Marsh. 

The village had the distinction in Domesday as being one of the few villages in the country still owned by a native rather than a Norman family. It remained in this family (who later took the name &#x27;de Wolverton&#x27; after the town of Wolverton) until 1442 when it was sold to All Souls College, Oxford. 

Padbury is near Milton Keynes, just under 50 miles north of London.

During the English Civil War Padbury was the site of a skirmish between the Royalist and Parliamentarian forces. The Royalists won on this occasion, and the burial of eight Parliamentarian soldiers is recorded in the burial register for 2 July 2 1643.

In December 2014 a hoard of 5,251½ silver coins from the late Anglo Saxon period was found in a field at Lenborough near Padbury by an 8-year-old boy among others. It had originally been deposited within a lead container; the coins were sent to the British Museum for evaluation and conservation.

==Hospitality== 
The village features two pubs, &#x27;The New Inn&#x27; and &#x27;The Blackbird&#x27;.

==Facilities== 
The village has two tennis courts, a football pitch and a Multi Use Games Area (MUGA). 

== Education ==
Padbury Church of England School is a mixed Church of England primary school. It is a voluntary controlled school, which takes children from the age of four through to the age of eleven. The school has approximately 110 pupils. It has been ranked in the top 10 performing schools of over 220 primary schools in Buckinghamshire.

<text>Pednor is a hamlet in the parish of Chartridge, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located in the Chiltern Hills northwest of Chesham and seven miles southeast of Wendover.

The hamlet name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;Peada&#x27;s slope&#x27;. In 1541, following the dissolution of the monasteries the lands at Pednor were surrendered by Missenden Abbey and became part of the estates owned by John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford. There is a medieval moat sited at Little Pednor Farm which is recorded by English Heritage as associated with the lands transferred from the Abbey and was later succeeded as the predominant residence within the estate by Pednor House.

Pednor Mead is that part of Pednor which is closest to Chesham along the valley known as Pednor Bottom. A number of springs that source the River Chess lie along this bottom. There are farms called Great and Little Pednor which lie beyond the town at this point. The roads connecting them are used for the annual &quot;Tour de Pednor&quot; charity cycle ride.

Pednormead End is a neighbourhood within Chesham adjacent to the Old Town at the start of the Pednor Road.

<text>Bynum is an unincorporated community in northeastern Chatham County, North Carolina, United States on the banks of the Haw River. Bynum is north of Pittsboro and south of Chapel Hill. It is also known as Bynum Mill Village or Bynum Mill Hill.

Bynum&#x27;s most notable building is the Bynum General Store at 950 Bynum Road, Bynum, NC 27228. For many years the store, run by Frank and Louise Harris, was known as Harris and Farrell General Store. The post office, once located at an older store to the south, brought everyone in town and many nearby rural residents to the store. Retired loggers, business people, and mill workers often sat on the bench in front of the store passing on news and rumors and telling stories. The store was a natural community center and information hub. When the store and post office closed in 2006, the community formed a non-profit called Bynum Front Porch and kept the store in use as an event and community center. The Bynum Front Porch Music Series runs every Friday evening, May–September at the Bynum General Store. Tift Merritt started her music career playing on the General Store&#x27;s front porch.

==History==

The town began life as a &quot;cotton mill town.&quot; The original mill was built about 1872 beside the Haw River. There was a wooden dam about 1000 feet upstream and water from the mill race powered water wheels. Later the dam was rebuilt with concrete and electrical generators installed. The spinning mill was purchased by John Milton Odell of Concord, North Carolina in 1886.

In stages from circa 1890 to 1910, small two to six room houses were built on the hill above the mill and rented to the mill workers and their families. Bynum was one of the first areas in Chatham County to have electric lights because turbines provided electricity for both the mill operation and the houses. The mill workers were paid in scrip. The scrip was only usable to pay their rent or at the &quot;company store&quot; (also owned by the mill).

In the 1970s the county commissioners, using federal grant money, bought the 73 mill worker houses from J.M.Odell Manufacturing Company with a Housing and Urban Development grant. With the money the streets were paved, cement blocks enclosed brick piers under houses, electrical boxes were updated and each house was supplied with indoor plumbing for a kitchen and bathroom. The existing tenants, who had been paying less than $10 a month rent to the mill, were given the chance to buy their homes with favorable long-term mortgages. Many mill workers had lived all their lives in these homes. Most bought their homes. Other homes found eager buyers. Many of the mill workers, suddenly in possession of rapidly appreciating assets, sold to newcomers and bought more modern homes elsewhere. Many of the new owners were college educated younger people, musicians, craftspeople, and artists. 

Odell Manufacturing closed the Bynum mill in December, 1983. It was sold to a businessman from the neighboring county who used part of it to make lamp shades, but soon went out of business. The mill buildings sat vacant and decaying for many years, then burned down in March, 2001. Most of the original mill houses are still standing and are now private homes.

The former mill site is now part of the Lower Haw River State Natural Area. There is a canoe put-in, trail head and parking lot on Bynum Church Road. A trail follows the Haw River southeast to Pokeberry Creek. Interpretive displays about the mill and the mill village are under development. The turbine building is still standing and the mill race empties into the Haw River nearby. The area adjoins and is managed by the Jordan Lake State Recreation Area.
The bridge crossing the Haw River at Bynum was originally a covered wooden bridge. It connected the major north–south highway in piedmont area of North Carolina—with Chapel Hill to the north and Pittsboro and Sanford to the south. The old Bynum Bridge replaced it in 1922 - concrete and approximately an 800-foot span. It was closed to motor vehicle traffic in 1999, but it is currently a pedestrian bridge and part of the statewide designated bicycle route as well as being a gathering place for the community on Halloween where many local folks artfully carve Jack-o&#x27;-lanterns and display them along the sides of the bridge. Cars now cross the Haw River on the newer US 15-501 bridges about 1000 feet north. There is another canoe take-out, dam and the mill race sluice gates at US 15-501.

==Arts and culture==
Hundreds of Jack-o-lanterns line the old bridge rails on Halloween night from dark until midnight, and local artist and musicians perform. There are haunted houses and trick or treaters at the Bynum Methodist Church and Ruritan Club near the old bridge.

The Bynum Community Garden is on Bynum Hill Road. Chatham County&#x27;s Earl Thompson Park is also on Bynum Hill Road and has playground and a baseball field.

The Robert Joseph Moore House and Dr. E. H. Ward Farm are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Notable people==
Banker and philanthropist Bill Bynum was raised in Bynum.

<text>Vlotho () is a town in the district of Herford, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

==Geography==
Vlotho is located along the Weser river, south of the Wiehengebirge, bordering on the Ravensberger Hügelland in the west, Lipperland in the south, and the Weserbergland in the east. The Weser river runs through the city east to north and thus separates the northeast part of the town, Uffeln, from the rest of the city. The highest point is the &quot;Bonstapel&quot; at 342 m in the south-east.

===Neighbouring municipalities===
Vlotho borders on Herford and Löhne in the west, Bad Oeynhausen and Porta Westfalica (both Minden-Lübbecke district) in the north, Kalletal in the east, and Lemgo and Bad Salzuflen (both Lippe district) in the south.

===Division of the town===
* Exter
* Uffeln
* Valdorf
* Vlotho

==History==
The earliest historical records of Vlotho date back to the year 1185. In 1248, Vlotho gained the official status of a city, but this was subsequently lost due to depopulation resulting from pestilence and war. In the 17th century, Vlotho recovered as a location for industry, most notably paper. During the Thirty Years War, on 17 October 1638 Vlotho was the site of a battle, which resulted in a victory for an Imperial army under the command of Field Marshal Melchior, Count of Hatzfeldt over a Palatinate-Swedish army under the command of Charles Louis of Palatine. In 1650, Vlotho regained the right to hold a market, and in 1719, became an independent city. A harbour was built and Vlotho became the location of cigar, machine, and textile industry. In 1875, Vlotho station was constructed, and in 1928, a bridge replaced the ferry across the Weser river. In 1969, the old city of Vlotho was unified with the communities of Exter and Valdorf. In 1973, Uffeln (formerly part of the district of Minden) joined Vlotho.

==Economy==
A major part of the local economy is the emerging tourist industry. There is still some machine industry.

<doc id="418527" wikidata="Q3307484" url="?curid=418527" title="Pitchcott">
<text>Pitchcott is a village and civil parish in the Aylesbury Vale district of Buckinghamshire, England. It is about north-east of Waddesdon, slightly less than south of Winslow and slightly more than 4 miles north of Aylesbury. It is in the civil parish of Oving.

The parish is small, covering . The highest point is Pitchcott Hill, about above sea level. The village is on the eastern brow of the hill, between about and above sea level.

==Archaeology==

A Roman road called Carter&#x27;s Lane forms part of the parish&#x27;s western boundary with Quainton. There is some evidence of Roman occupation south of the village.

Pitchcott is a shrunken village: around the surviving settlement, to the south-east and in other directions, are medieval house platforms and traces of tracks. South-west of the former parish church is a mound that may have been the base of a medieval windmill. The parish also has good examples of ridge and furrow, showing that in the Middle Ages some of the land now farmed as pasture used to be arable.

In 1927 only about were arable and was grassland. A transition from arable farming to sheep pasture in previous centuries, aided by enclosure, may explain why Pitchcott village shrank.

==Manor==
The toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;cottage where pitch is stored&quot;. Pitchcott is not named in the Domesday Book of 1086 or in 12th-century records. In 1225 the manor was one fee of the Honour of Wallingford. In 1540 this was merged with the Honour of Ewelme in Oxfordshire, and the last mention of Pitchcott&#x27;s overlordship dates from 1550.

In 1225 Pitchcott&#x27;s mesne lord was Roger Pipard and in 1284 it was held by Robert Pipard. In the 14th century it passed to the Earls of Hereford and in 1377, four years after the death of Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford it was held by his heirs in attachment to the manor of Great Haseley in Oxfordshire. The 7th Earl died with no male heir, so Pitchcott passed &quot;via&quot; his elder daughter, Eleanor de Bohun, to his granddaughter, Anne of Gloucester, who became married to Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford. The last-known record of the mesne lordship is from 1400, three years before Edmund Stafford died.

In 1225 Roger Pipard&#x27;s tenant was Richard Vernon of Haddon, Derbyshire. Both Haddon and Pitchcott remained in the Vernon family until Sir George Vernon died in 1566, leaving them to his daughter, Margaret Stanley. In 1588 her son Edward mortgaged Pitchcott to Richard Saunders (d. 1601), whose family were the lords of several other manors in Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire, including the manor of Puttenham. The Saunders had established themselves in Buckinghamshire during the previous two centuries and Richard had married Elizabeth Blount, whose family were descendants of Sir Walter Blount (d. 1403). In the 17th century, Pitchcott manor passed to Richard Saunders&#x27; eldest son, John Saunders, who had married Anne Hawtrey, the daughter of William Hawtrey (d. 1597) of Chequers. John&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth had married Sir Walter Pye, and Sir Walter and Lady Elizabeth Pye conveyed Pitchcott manor to her uncles Sir Thomas and Francis Saunders. The manor was held in moieties by the two branches of the Saunders family. Francis Saunders was imprisoned briefly for debt and Sir Thomas Saunders (1593–1653) had to come to his aid. As part of the repayment, much of the lands and rights to the manor of Pitchcott were conveyed by Francis Saunders to Sir Thomas Saunders. Several members of the Saunders family served as High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire.

The branch of the Saunders family that descended from Sir Thomas Saunders (1593–1653) benefited from the majority of the income from the estate. Sir Thomas Saunders was listed as the Lord of the Manor of Pitchcott by Richard Grenville on his list of Buckinghamshire Gentry in 1640. Thomas Saunders (d. 1690) was the heir of Sir Thomas Saunders. Thomas had married Elizabeth Proby, a daughter of Sir Heneage Proby and the sister of Sir Thomas Proby, 1st Baronet of Elton. His son, Sir Thomas Saunders (1665–1741) inherited the manor, although he resided at the other estate he possessed called Newland Park in Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire. Both Pitchcott and Newland Park were held by several more generations of the descendants of Sir Thomas Saunders until a cousin, Gov. Thomas Saunders (1713–1775) of Brill House, purchased their moiety. This Thomas Saunders had been President of Madras for the British East India Company and had built a substantial fortune during his tenure there. Thomas had married Christian Pitt, the niece of William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, who served as Prime Minister of Great Britain. Thomas and Christian Saunders&#x27; son, Thomas, inherited the manor. Thomas had been an officer in the army but retired early and moved to Vienna. The running of the estate at Pitchcott was left to a manager, a Mr. Chaplin. Thomas died childless and the manor passed to his cousin, Thomas Saunders, who died in 1831. Pitchcott was divided between his two surviving sisters and two nieces. In 1852 their representatives sold Pitchcott to Mayer Amschel de Rothschild, but in 1853 he exchanged it with Christ Church, Oxford for property at Mentmore. Christ Church still held Pitchcott in the 1920s. The eldest male line of the Saunders family emigrated to Guelph in what was then Upper Canada in the mid-19th century.

Pitchcott held a manorial court in the 15th and 16th centuries.

==Parish church==
The 12th-century Church of England parish church of Saint Giles has been deconsecrated and converted to a private house, but the churchyard remains in use. Pitchcott is now part of the ecclesiastical parish of Oving with Pitchcott, for which the parish church is All Saints&#x27; in Oving, north-east of Pitchcott.

The oldest part of St Giles&#x27; is the nave, which is probably 12th-century. The chancel was built in the first half of the 13th century, and its south wall retains its two original lancet windows. The more easterly of the two windows has a low sill forming a sedile. In the east jamb of the westerly window was a 13th-century stone book-rest. The priest&#x27;s door on its south side of the chancel was inserted in about 1340.

In the nave the present north doorway and the two south windows were inserted in the 15th century. The north doorway is now blocked. The west tower was added in the 15th century, and its upper stage was added or rebuilt in the 16th century. A datestone states that the south porch was built or rebuilt in 1662. The church was over-restored in 1864. The work included inserting two north windows in the nave to match the 15th-century south ones, and building a new chancel arch. The chancel east window has 19th-century stained glass.

St Giles&#x27; has three bells in the tower and a sanctus bell. The second bell is inscribed &quot;Sent Luke Apostel, 1590&quot; and may have been cast by Robert III Newcombe and Bartholomew Atton of Buckingham. The other two bells were cast by the Chandler family of bell-founders of Drayton Parslow: the treble in 1686 by an unknown member of the family and the tenor by George Chandler in 1717. St Giles&#x27; had two silver communion services: a paten and small chalice dating from 1569, and an 1871 chalice with an 1884 paten.

The ecclesiastical parish of St Giles was united with that of All Saints&#x27;, Oving in 1902. By the end of 1967 St Giles&#x27; had been deconsecrated and its fittings sold and dispersed. The stone book-rest in the chancel was removed to All Saints&#x27;, Oving. St Giles&#x27; was then converted into a private house. It is a Grade II* listed building.

John Womborn was parson of &#x27;Pitchcote&#x27; in 1401.

==Economic history==
A datestone records that Manor Farmhouse was built in 1657. The house was altered in the 18th century and, subsequently, now has an irregular L-shaped plan. Lower Farmhouse is a symmetrical building dating from about 1830.

A few barn conversions were made in 2007.

<text>Leuchars Station is a British Army installation located in Leuchars, Fife, on the east coast of Scotland, near to the historic town of St Andrews.

Formerly RAF Leuchars, it was the second most northerly air defence station in the United Kingdom (the most northerly being RAF Lossiemouth). The station ceased to be an RAF station in April 2015 when control of the site was transferred to the Army.

==History==
=== RAF Leuchars ===

The Royal Air Force station at Leuchars opened on 16 March 1920, although its association with the military can be traced back to 1911 when military balloons were operated at the site. During its history the site was used as a RNAS fleet fighter station and later as a RAF Coastal Command airfield. Throughout the Cold War and beyond, the station was home to fighter aircraft which policed northern UK airspace. The station also hosted an annual International Airshow.

===Transfer to the Army===
On 18 July 2011, Defence Secretary Liam Fox announced that RAF Leuchars would close as part of the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010, with the station being transferred to British Army control in 2015 and the Typhoon aircraft based at Leuchars moving to RAF Lossiemouth in Moray.

In preparation for the closure, RAF Leuchars Mountain Rescue Team disbanded in November 2013 whilst No. 58 Squadron of the RAF Regiment and No. 6 Force Protection Wing disbanded on 10 May 2014. No. 6 Squadron was the first Typhoon unit to depart Leuchars, heading for its new home at Lossiemouth in June 2014. No. 1 Squadron followed on 8 September 2014, at which point responsibility for Quick Reaction Alert (North) was transferred from Leuchars to Lossiemouth.

Control of Leuchars was transferred to the British Army on 31 March 2015, when it was renamed Leuchars Station. The term &#x27;station&#x27; was used as the size of the installation is smaller than a garrison but larger than a barracks and to reflect the range of army and RAF occupants. The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards gradually relocated from Germany in the spring and summer of 2015 along with 2 Close Support Battalion of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and 110 Provost Company, Royal Military Police. The transition from RAF to Army control was considered to have gone smoothly by Fife Council in terms of its impact on the local community.

In February 2018, local councillors suggested that the name of the installation be changed as it could be confused with Leuchars Railway Station.

RAF Typhoon FGR4 aircraft and the Quick Reaction Alert (Interceptor) North capability operated from Leuchars between 10 August and the week commencing 16 October 2020 whilst the intersection of RAF Lossiemouth&#x27;s two runways was resurfaced.

== Role and operations ==
In December 2018, there were approximately 750 members of the UK regular armed forces, 30 members of the full time reserve service personnel and 100 civil servants based at Leuchars.

=== British Army ===

The primary Army unit based at Leuchars is the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards. It is a cavalry regiment which specialises in the reconnaissance role. It is equipped with the Jackal 2 armoured fighting vehicle and the Coyote tactical support vehicle.

Other army units included 2 Close Support Battalion of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) and 110 Provost Company of the Royal Military Police.

=== Royal Air Force ===
The station continues to be home to several RAF units, including No. 612 (County of Aberdeen) Squadron RAuxAF, the East of Scotland Universities Air Squadron incorporating No. 12 Air Experience Flight, and the headquarters of Scotland and Northern Ireland Region and Central Scotland Wing of the Air Training Corps.

The airfield is maintained by the RAF as a diversion airfield for military aircraft.

<text>Haywood is an unincorporated community in southeastern Chatham County, North Carolina, United States. It is part of the Moncure census-designated place. Along with several other unincorporated communities, it lies along the panhandle of Chatham County between Lee County and Wake County. Haywood lies at an elevation of .

==History==
Haywood was settled in 1796 at the Deep and Haw Rivers confluence, which marks the Cape Fear River&#x27;s beginning for it was decided, Haywood was one of the sites considered in 1788 as a possible location for North Carolina&#x27;s new capital, although Raleigh was ultimately chosen. Not only did the town lose the opportunity of hosting the state capital, in 1792 Haywood was also passed up as the location for what would become the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. During its first four years after settlement, the community was renamed twice, from Lyons to Haywoodsborough to Haywood.

The new town pinned its hopes on the shipping industry, as Haywood&#x27;s location at the confluence of two rivers was suitable for an inland port. The state government gave the Cape Fear Navigation Company the right to build and operate locks on the Cape Fear River. The rivers, however, proved difficult to navigate, and by 1834 the company had lost interest in improving the river above Fayetteville. In 1852, the Cape Fear Navigation Company formally abrogated its rights to that section to the newly formed Cape Fear and Deep River Navigation Company. The Deep River Company was troubled financially and never developed a port for Haywood. The final blow to the shipping industry came with the completion of the railroad. Haywood made a critical mistake by denying trains access to the town; consequently, the railroad station would be located in Moncure, to the west.

Haywood reached its economic peak in the period before the Civil War. Reconstruction briefly brought about a racially integrated election in 1870 as well as integrated political meetings. The 20th century was marked by economic decline and the dissolution of the local government.

The Obediah Farrar House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.

<text>Jean-Henri Riesener (; 4 July 1734 – 6 January 1806) was a famous German &quot;ébéniste&quot; (cabinetmaker), working in Paris, whose work exemplified the early neoclassical &quot;Louis XVI style&quot;.

==Life and career==
Riesener was born in Gladbeck, Westphalia, Holy Roman Empire. He moved to Paris, where he apprenticed soon after 1754 with Jean-François Oeben, whose widow he married; he was received master &quot;ébéniste&quot; in January 1768. The following year, he began supplying furniture for the Crown and in July 1774 formally became &quot;ébéniste ordinaire du roi&quot;, &quot;the greatest Parisian &quot;ébéniste&quot; of the Louis XVI period.&quot; Riesener was responsible for some of the richest examples of furniture in the Louis XVI style, as the French court embarked on furnishing commissions on a luxurious scale that had not been seen since the time of Louis XIV: between 1774 and 1784, he received on average commissions amounting to 100,000 livres per annum.He and David Roentgen were Marie Antoinette&#x27;s favourite cabinet-makers. Besides commissions directly to the &quot;Garde-Meuble&quot; he delivered case furniture for the comte and comtesse de Provence, the comte d&#x27;Artois, &quot;Mesdames&quot; the king&#x27;s aunts, and the ducs de Penthièvre, de la Rochefoucauld, Choiseul-Praslin, Biron, as well as rich &quot;fermiers généraux&quot;.
He used floral and figural marquetry techniques to a great extent, contrasting with refined parquetry and trelliswork grounds, in addition to gilt-bronze mounts. His carcases were more finely finished than those of many of his Parisian contemporaries, and he attempted to disguise the screwheads that attached his mounts with overhanging details of foliage. It seems likely that as a royal craftsman he was able to circumvent guild restrictions and produce his own ormolu|gilt-bronze mounts: Riesener&#x27;s princely portrait by Antoine Vestier shows the cabinet-maker at one of his richly-mounted tables, with drawings for gilt-bronze mounts. Many of his pieces featured complicated mechanisms that raised or lowered table-tops or angled reading stands. Through his wife he was related to other master craftsmen in Paris, notably the &quot;ébénistes&quot; Roger Vandercruse Lacroix and Martin Carlin.
He completed the &quot;Bureau du Roi&quot;, which had been started in 1760, under his predecessor and master, Oeben; his name alone appears in the marquetry.
The floral designs were derived from the &quot;Livre de Principes de Fleurs&quot;, an undated compilation of engravings of flowers by Juste Chevillet after drawings by Louis Tessier.

In 1774 he delivered the commode for the bedroom of Louis XVI at Versailles, now in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle. An even richer commode replaced it the following year (now at the Musée Condé, Chantilly).

The drop-front secretary (&quot;sécretaire à abattant&quot;) initially designed by Oeben, or by Riesener in Oeben&#x27;s workshop, presents a vertical rectangle of superposed panels and a frieze, on short legs. The upper panel drops down to provide a writing surface, revealing a fitted interior.

From 1784, with France near bankruptcy, the pace of court commissions dropped radically; Thierry de Ville d&#x27;Avray succeeded Pierre-Elizabeth de Fontanieu at the &quot;Garde-Meuble le la Couronne&quot; and turned for necessary economy to less expensive suppliers, such as Guillaume Beneman; Riesener&#x27;s last pieces for the court featured sober but richly-figured West Indian mahogany veneers and more restrained use of gilt-bronze mounts. Queen Marie Antoinette continued to favour Riesener through the 1780s

With the French Revolution, Riesener was retained by the Directory, and sent in 1794 to Versailles to remove the &quot;insignia of feudality&quot; from furniture he had recently made: royal cyphers and fleurs-de-lys were replaced with innocuous panels. During the French revolutionary sales he ruined himself by buying back furniture that was being sold at derisory prices. When he attempted to resell his accumulated stock, tastes had changed and the old clientele dispersed or dead. After a short secondary career in property speculation, Riesener died in relative obscurity in Paris in 1806.

== The Riesener Project ==

Jean-Henri Riesener and his furniture was the subject of a six-year research project carried out by curators and conservators at the Wallace Collection, Waddesdon Manor and the Royal Collection. Close examination of the thirty pieces of Riesener furniture in the three collections, along with art historical and archival research, revealed much that was previously unknown about the materials and techniques the cabinetmaker used, as well as his workshop practices. The Project also explored the development of the market for Riesener&#x27;s furniture in the nineteenth century, and the influence that his designs and cabinetmaking techniques had on later furniture-makers.

The findings of the Project led to the publishing of the first major monograph on Riesener, while the detailed technical examination of the materials, structure and condition of the objects that took place, along with scientific analysis, allowed for interactive 3D models to be created. The models reveal the great complexity involved in making such furniture, as well as Riesener&#x27;s ingenuity and resourcefulness as a craftsmen. They can be explored through a comprehensive microsite and trail dedicated to Riesener, along with catalogue entries, essays, videos and isometric drawings.

==Collections==
As a result of the French Revolutionary Sales in the early nineteenth century, UK collectors had bought for the decoration of their stately homes and palaces significant numbers of French royal furniture (mobilier royal), which today forms the basis of the great collections that still remain in the UK. Towards the end of the industrial age until the agricultural depression of the 1920s, large numbers of works, predominately in UK collections were auctioned off and made their passage to American collectors. Still to this date UK collections are especially rich in the works of French furniture and decorative arts, particularly of Royal provenance, and the UK continues to enjoy perhaps the greatest repository of Riesener&#x27;s works outside Paris.

=== Writing-table ===
Described as a &quot;flat-sided rectangular table, break-fronted on all four sides, which is supported on four straight tapering legs, square in section with indented corners&quot;, Riesener&#x27;s French Writing-Tables were normally extremely fine in the modelling of gilt-bronze mounts.

As a result, &quot;she was installed in a new apartment on the first floor of the &quot;Aile du Midi&quot; overlooking the &quot;Orangerie&quot; and the &quot;Parterre du Midi&quot;&quot; and furnished by Riesener &quot;which was of a quality befitting a Daughter of France with an establishment of her own&quot;.

<text>Pitstone (formerly Pightelsthorn, with possible variation Pychelesthorn in 1399) is a village and civil parish in east Buckinghamshire, England. It is at the foot of the central range of the Chiltern Hills, centred east of Aylesbury and south of Leighton Buzzard. It directly adjoins the village of Ivinghoe, and the two villages share some facilities.

==History==
The village name is Anglo-Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;Picel&#x27;s thorn tree&#x27;. It was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Pincelestorne&quot;.

Pitstone was given to the abbey at Ashridge by the Earl of Cornwall in 1283. In 1290 King Edward I spent Christmas in Pitstone at the estate that had been given to the abbey, and stayed for five weeks, during which time he held parliament in Ashridge. His stay caused great inconvenience to the local inhabitants of the village who were legally obliged to keep the king and his court.

It was described in a Victorian gazetteer by John Marius Wilson as &quot;7 miles in length and 1 in breadth. Post-town, Tring. Acres, 2,836 [] Real property, £3,692. Pop., 581. Houses, 109. The property is divided among a few.&quot;. Its area dropped between 1851 and 1891 from the said number acres to 1,644. The number of houses rose most steeply in the 1950s, from 169 to 252.

==Landmarks and neighbourhoods==

Its Castlemead area of housing and business units was named after Castle Cement Company which was the last owner of the Pitstone cement works, which operated from 1937 to 1991.

The area around St Mary&#x27;s Church is known as Church End.

A notable building is Pitstone Windmill, which is owned by the National Trust. The windmill was formerly capable of rotating to face the prevailing wind, as evidenced by the wheel protruding from one side of the structure. Although it no longer can do so, the wheel remains and its pivot point is clearly visible.

Pitstone Green Museum provides working insights into agricultural history and various supporting trades. The museum is to the south of the village proper on a farm.

Pitstone Hill, above the village, is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), designated for its botanical interest. The hill is crossed by the Ridgeway National Trail. A former chalk quarry has been converted to College Lake nature reserve, a flagship reserve of the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust, and the area east of the lake within the nature reserve is a geological SSSI, Pitstone Quarry.

==Geography==
The elongated civil parish is semi-urban in the extreme west north-west (WNW) and is otherwise rural and elevated, rising to the opposite direction. Approximately following the north-west border is the Grand Union Canal. Its population rose in the ten years to 1961 from 544 to 766.

== Sport and leisure ==
Pitstone has a Non-League football team Pitstone &amp; Ivinghoe United F.C. who play at The Recreation Ground on Vicarage Road. The village also has a cricket team, Ivinghoe &amp; Pitstone United Cricket Club who play in the Mid Bucks Cricket League on Saturdays at the Recreation Ground; they also play friendly matches on Sundays and mid-week evening knock-outs. There are records of cricket being played at the Pitstone Recreation Ground since 1856, when the village took on (and beat) Luton.[Bucks Advertiser, 12 July 1856, p. 8 ‘Cricket: Pitstone v Luton’] 

Pitstone is the home of internationally acclaimed cyclist, Nick Clarke who holds the record for the RRA &quot;Side to Side&quot; record of Pembroke to Great Yarmouth.

==History==

Stockmann was established by Georg Franz Stockmann, a merchant from Lübeck, Germany who took a job as a bookkeeper at a Nuutajärvi Glassworks store in Helsinki Senate Square. In 1859, Stockmann became the manager of the store. In 1862, Stockmann took control of the store and the Stockmann department store was officially established. In 1902, the company was renamed G.F. Stockmann Aktiebolag. The shareholders were Stockmann and his two sons, Karl and Frans. Stockmann died in 1906. In 1930, the Stockmann, Helsinki centre store was finished, complete with revolving doors, a soda fountain, and escalators. Also in 1930, Stockmann bought a neighbouring book store, Akateeminen kirjakauppa (, the Academic Bookstore). The first television transmission in Finland was broadcast from the department store in 1950.

In the 1950s, Stockmann opened a department store in Tampere. Stockmann opened department stores in Tapiola in 1981 and Turku in 1982. In 1986, the first () sales were held. The sales proved extremely popular and became a biannual event. The first Stockmann stores outside of Finland opened in Moscow in 1989, and in Tallinn in 1993. The northernmost department store, in Oulu, opened in 2001 and closed in 2017.

In 1989, Stockmann began operations in Russia, with the opening of a small stand in the GUM department store in Moscow.

In December 2007, Stockmann acquired Lindex, a Swedish clothing retailer with 331 outlets in the Nordic region and the Baltic states.

Stockmann sold Seppälä on 1 April 2015 to Seppälä&#x27;s CEO Eveliina Melentjeff and her husband Timo Melentjeff.

In September 2015, Stockmann sold The Academic Bookstore to Bonnier Books AB media.

In February 2016, Stockmann sold its operations in Russia to Reviva Holdings. Stockmann continued to own and operate Nevsky Centre in Saint Petersburg until it was sold in January 2019.

On January 1, 2017, Stockmann sold Hobby Hall to SGN Group.

In 2017, the company sold its food division, Stockmann Herkku, to S Group for €27 million.

In May 2018, the company sold Kirjatalo, the building opposite their flagship store in Helsinki which houses the Academic Bookstore, for €108 million.

In March 2019, CEO Lauri Veijalainen resigned.

In June 2019, the company announced 150 layoffs.

In April 2020, Stockmann applied for corporate restructuring due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Finland. Its restructuring plan took effect in December 2020 over an eight-year period.

<text>New Hill is an unincorporated community located in southwestern Wake County, North Carolina, United States, at the crossroads of old U.S. 1 (State Road 1011, running northeast–southwest), New Hill Olive Chapel Road (running north) and New Hill Holleman Road (running south). New Hill is located along the original alignment of the New Hope Valley Railway between Durham and Bonsal. The ZIP Code for New Hill is 27562.

The community is near the southern terminus of the American Tobacco Trail. It is also the location of Duke Energy Progress&#x27;s Shearon Harris nuclear power plant and the associated Harris Lake recreation center.

A regional wastewater reclamation project has been completed in the area. The project was opposed by local residents who believed that placing the facility in the middle of their community would adversely impact their way of life. A settlement was reached in early 2011 between the towns building the plant and the New Hill community.

The Samuel Bartley Holleman House and New Hill Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="418537" wikidata="Q846970" url="?curid=418537" title="Relic (Preston and Child novel)">
<text>Relic is a 1995 novel by American authors Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, and the first in the Special Agent Pendergast series. As a horror novel and techno-thriller, it comments on the possibilities inherent in genetic manipulation, and is critical of museums and their role both in society and in the scientific community. It is the basis of the film &quot;The Relic&quot; (1997).

==Plot==

In September 1987, Dr. Julian Whittlesey is leading an expedition through the Amazon Basin, in the Brazilian rainforest, in search of the lost Kothoga tribe. He hopes to prove that they still do exist and in the process learn more about their culture, including their lizard god Mbwun (&quot;He Who Walks On All Fours&quot;), supposedly the son of Satan. Whittlesey disappears after finding the mutilated body of his partner. 12 months later, a dock worker in Belém is brutally killed when a freighter arrives with a shipment of crates from the expedition.

Seven years later, in a fictionalized version of New York City&#x27;s American Museum of Natural History, two young boys are found dead in a museum stairwell after getting lost after hours. NYPD Lieutenant Vincent D&#x27;Agosta leads the investigation into the museum basement, while museum leadership, including curator Winston Wright, deputy head Ian Cuthbert, and public relations director Lavinia Rickman, attempt to keep the murders under wraps in the lead-up to the grand gala opening of the new &quot;Superstition&quot; exhibition featuring wealthy benefactors. Rickman hires &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter Bill Smithback, Jr. to cover the murder investigation, but repeatedly edits his reports to be more palatable towards the museum and its leadership. Employees spread the rumor of the &quot;Museum Beast&quot;, a legendary monster that has been roaming the subbasement of the museum for years. D&#x27;Agosta is shocked during the autopsy of the two boys when he discovers a claw buried in one of the boy&#x27;s brains.

When a security guard suffers a similarly brutal death, FBI Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast arrives to aid in the investigation, while the search spreads to the tunnels under the museum. Ethnopharmacology grad student Margo Green and her advisor, Dr. Whitney Frock, discover with Agent Pendergast that the claw from the autopsy matches the claws on a Mbwun figurine sent back to the museum in a crate from Whittlesey&#x27;s expedition. Margo steals letters from a secure vault that Whittlesey had sent to a museum colleague named H.C. Montague, who later disappeared. Pendergast reveals that he is investigating the similarities between the museum murders and the killings of the Brazilian dock worker in 1988, as well as several other dock workers in Louisiana later that year, having traced the shipment of Whittlesey&#x27;s crates as a connection between the incidents. However, other than the Mbwun figurine and packing material, the crates were empty. 

Margo and Smithback find a colleague of Whittlesey&#x27;s to whom one of the letters was addressed, and learn that Whittlesey claimed to have located the lost Kothoga tribe alive on a &quot;tepui&quot; deep in the Brazilian jungle, as well as a unique plant at the base of the &quot;tepui&quot; that had protein-like qualities to it. Intending to mine the entire area, the government bombarded the &quot;tepui&quot; with napalm in 1988, killing the remaining Kothoga. Margo and Frock realize that the plant Whittlesey discovered was the same plant that had been sent back in the crates as packing material, and run computerized analyses that find that the plants are rich in thalamoid hormones, which can also be found in small amounts in the human hypothalamus gland in the brain, and that the claw belonged to an unknown creature with simultaneous primate, reptile, and human genetics. They deduce that the creature is a predator of formidable strength, speed, and intelligence, and is dependent on the now-extinct plant fibers for nutrition; in its absence, it has been slaughtering humans and consuming their hypothalamus as a substitute.

Under pressure from the museum leadership, the gala is allowed to begin, with combined security presence from the NYPD and FBI. In the middle of the exhibition, gala attendees find a body hidden in the ceiling above a display, causing a mass panic. At the same time, an NYPD officer panics and opens fire on the security control room, destroying the central switching box and shutting down the museum&#x27;s power. This causes the museum to go into an automatic security lockdown, trapping many inside one section of the museum, including D&#x27;Agosta, Smithback, Cuthbert, Wright, and Rickman. Green, Frock, and Pendergast encounter the creature and shoot at it, only for the bullet to bounce off the creature&#x27;s skull. 

D&#x27;Agosta leads Smithback and a group of gala attendees down into the tunnels to seek an escape route, and the creature attacks, killing several people. The creature then finds the three directors hiding, and slaughters Rickman and Wright while leaving Cuthbert alone. He is rescued by a SWAT team shortly before the entire team is killed. The group from the gala reaches the sewers through rising stormwater and find the creature&#x27;s lair, an underground chamber filled with corpses and trinkets. Finally, they are able to escape onto the street via a manhole. Pendergast and Margo make a final stand against the creature and shoot it through the eye, killing the creature. 

Four weeks later, the survivors convene, and Pendergast explains that the &quot;Kothoga&quot; created the Mbwun by feeding a human the strange plant that Whittlesey had discovered and shipped back to the museum, which results in the subject transforming into the creature. When the &quot;tepui&quot; was destroyed, the Mbwun followed the last surviving samples of the plant in Whittlsey&#x27;s crates all the way to New York, living off the plant for years and killing Montague when he came to investigate. The museum directors covered up evidence of Montague&#x27;s disappearance and moved the crates into the heavily fortified vault; unable to access them, the Mbwun turned to murdering people and animals in the sewers and underground tunnels for their hypothalamus. 

In his lab, assistant curator Gregory Kawakita realizes that the creature itself was in fact Whittlesey after being forced to consume the plant by the Kothoga. Using the surviving samples of the plant, Kawakita is developing a drug that would turn the users first into addicts, then into &quot;Mbwun&quot; itself, and begins selling it on the street. He reflects that the Kothoga had no control over the Mbwun because of unlimited access to the plant, whereas he is the only person alive capable of making the drug, and believes that he will now assert control over the creatures where the Kothoga failed.

== Film adaptation ==
A film based on the book was released in 1997, but changed several aspects of the story, omitting numerous characters and changing the setting to the Chicago Museum of Natural History rather than the New York Museum of Natural History (fictional but strongly based on the American Museum of Natural History). The film was directed by Peter Hyams and stars Penelope Ann Miller as Dr. Margo Green, Tom Sizemore as Lt. Vincent D&#x27;Agosta, and Linda Hunt as Dr. Ann Cuthbert.

=== Changes from the novel ===
The film gives away key plot points throughout its duration; in contrast, in the novel, the explanation is delivered in the last few pages, giving the book a twist ending. The movie has a similar twist during its climax. The following table details additional changes.

<text>Green Level is an unincorporated community in southwestern Wake County, North Carolina, United States. It was founded and is one of the best preserved crossroads communities in the county. Although historically connected to the town of Apex, Green Level now lies within the municipal jurisdiction of the town of Cary.

== History ==
The community started as a crossroads along the stage route between Raleigh and Pittsboro in the first half of the 19th century. It formed where the stage route crossed the Holly Springs to Hillsborough Road. The community was literally named because it was &quot;green&quot; and &quot;level&quot;. Green Level was a resting spot for the stagecoach and also became a social and commercial hub for people who lived several miles out in the surrounding countryside. Families living in the area included Council, Ferrell, Mills, Upchurch, Utley, and Yates.

A post office was established in Green Level in 1847. Its postmasters included Thomas S. Johnson, Sidney W. Mitchell, Golden H. Upchurch, James H. Upchurch, and Thomas J. Utley. Its post office closed in 1888.

Green Level started growing after the Civil War and included a Baptist church, two grist and sawmills, a Masonic Lodge (founded in 1867), two schools, and seven stores by the early 1870s. The church was founded in 1870 by Rev. Matthew Ferrell and was originally known as the Providence Baptist Church but was later renamed Green Level Baptist Church in 1871.

Green Level continued to function as a commercial center through the early 20th century, important to the local bright-leaf tobacco farmers. This tobacco was a lucrative cash crop that grew especially well in Western Wake County because of its rich Triassic soils. However, with the arrival of the railroad and the automobile, the stage route and local community center was no longer as significant. Although Green Level began declining in the mid-20th century, its church and Masonic Lodge continued to be active. In the later part of the 20th century, the community became part of in an area of Wake County that was suburbanizing with commuters.

==Green Level Historic District==
The core of the community was designated the Green Level Historic District in 2001. This national historic district encompasses some that includes 31 contributing buildings, one contributing site and four contributing structures in the crossroads community of Green Level. It also includes a cemetery. Its boundaries are the intersection of Green Level Church Road and Green Level West Road, and Green Level Church Road north for approximately .

The district developed sometime during the period between roughly 1890 and 1945 and includes notable examples of Colonial Revival and Gothic Revival, style architecture. One of the central buildings of the community is Green Level Baptist Church (1907), located near the crossroads of Green Level Church Road and Green Level West Road. It features Gothic Revival details and is one of the best-preserved country churches in Wake County.

Other notable buildings include the Green Level Community Store (1945), A. C. and Helon Council House (late 19th century), the Vick and Mattie Council House. (), and the Alious H. and Daisey Mills Farm and Store (1916). The historic district also includes the. M. and Vallaria Council Farm, a well-preserved tobacco farm complex. Its National Register application form notes, &quot;The district as a whole remains remarkably intact, retaining integrity of setting, location, design, materials, feeling, and association.&quot;

<doc id="418544" wikidata="Q1328864" url="?curid=418544" title="Screen reader">
<text>A screen reader is a form of assistive technology (AT) that renders text and image content as speech or braille output. Screen readers are essential to people who are blind, and are useful to people who are visually impaired, illiterate, or have a learning disability. Screen readers are software applications that attempt to convey what people with normal eyesight see on a display to their users via non-visual means, like text-to-speech, sound icons, or a braille device. They do this by applying a wide variety of techniques that include, for example, interacting with dedicated accessibility APIs, using various operating system features (like inter-process communication and querying user interface properties), and employing hooking techniques.

Microsoft Windows operating systems have included the Microsoft Narrator screen reader since Windows 2000, though separate products such as Freedom Scientific&#x27;s commercially available JAWS screen reader and ZoomText screen magnifier and the free and open source screen reader NVDA by NV Access are more popular for that operating system. Apple Inc.&#x27;s macOS, iOS, and tvOS include VoiceOver as a built-in screen reader, while Google&#x27;s Android provides the Talkback screen reader and its ChromeOS can use ChromeVox. Similarly, Android-based devices from Amazon provide the VoiceView screen reader. There are also free and open source screen readers for Linux and Unix-like systems, such as Speakup and Orca.

== History ==
Around 1978, Al Overby of IBM Raleigh developed a prototype of a talking terminal, known as SAID (for Synthetic Audio Interface Driver), for the IBM 3270 terminal. SAID read the ASCII values of the display in a stream and spoke them through a large vocal track synthesizer the size of a suitcase, and it cost around $10,000. Dr. Jesse Wright, a blind research mathematician, and Jim Thatcher, formerly his graduate student from the University of Michigan, working as mathematicians for IBM, adapted this as an internal IBM tool for use by blind people. After the early IBM Personal Computer (PC) was released in 1981, Thatcher and Wright developed a software equivalent to SAID, called PC-SAID, or &quot;Personal Computer Synthetic Audio Interface Driver&quot;. This was renamed and released in 1984 as IBM Screen Reader, which became the proprietary eponym for that general class of assistive technology.

== Types ==

=== Command-line (text) ===

In early operating systems, such as MS-DOS, which employed command-line interfaces (CLIs), the screen display consisted of characters mapping directly to a screen buffer in memory and a cursor position. Input was by keyboard. All this information could therefore be obtained from the system either by hooking the flow of information around the system and reading the screen buffer or by using a standard hardware output socket and communicating the results to the user.

In the 1980s, the Research Centre for the Education of the Visually Handicapped (RCEVH) at the University of Birmingham developed a Screen Reader for the BBC Micro and NEC Portable.

=== Graphical ===

==== Off-screen models ====

With the arrival of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), the situation became more complicated. A GUI has characters and graphics drawn on the screen at particular positions, and therefore there is no purely textual representation of the graphical contents of the display. Screen readers were therefore forced to employ new low-level techniques, gathering messages from the operating system and using these to build up an &quot;off-screen model&quot;, a representation of the display in which the required text content is stored.

For example, the operating system might send messages to draw a command button and its caption. These messages are intercepted and used to construct the off-screen model. The user can switch between controls (such as buttons) available on the screen and the captions and control contents will be read aloud and/or shown on a refreshable braille display.

Screen readers can also communicate information on menus, controls, and other visual constructs to permit blind users to interact with these constructs. However, maintaining an off-screen model is a significant technical challenge; hooking the low-level messages and maintaining an accurate model are both difficult tasks.

==== Accessibility APIs ====

Operating system and application designers have attempted to address these problems by providing ways for screen readers to access the display contents without having to maintain an off-screen model. These involve the provision of alternative and accessible representations of what is being displayed on the screen accessed through an API. Existing APIs include:
* Android Accessibility Framework
* Apple Accessibility API
* AT-SPI
* IAccessible2
* Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA)
* Microsoft UI Automation
* Java Access Bridge

Screen readers can query the operating system or application for what is currently being displayed and receive updates when the display changes. For example, a screen reader can be told that the current focus is on a button and the button caption to be communicated to the user. This approach is considerably easier for the developers of screen readers, but fails when applications do not comply with the accessibility API: for example, Microsoft Word does not comply with the MSAA API, so screen readers must still maintain an off-screen model for Word or find another way to access its contents. One approach is to use available operating system messages and application object models to supplement accessibility APIs.

Screen readers can be assumed to be able to access all display content that is not intrinsically inaccessible. Web browsers, word processors, icons and windows and email programs are just some of the applications used successfully by screen reader users. However, according to some users, using a screen reader is considerably more difficult than using a GUI, and many applications have specific problems resulting from the nature of the application (e.g. animations) or failure to comply with accessibility standards for the platform (e.g. Microsoft Word and Active Accessibility).

=== Self-voicing programs and applications ===

Some programs and applications have voicing technology built in alongside their primary functionality. These programs are termed self-voicing and can be a form of assistive technology if they are designed to remove the need to use a screen reader.

=== Cloud-based ===

Some telephone services allow users to interact with the internet remotely. For example, TeleTender can read web pages over the phone and does not require special programs or devices on the user side.

Virtual assistants can sometimes read out written documents (textual web content, PDF documents, e-mails etc.) The best-known examples are Apple&#x27;s Siri, Google Assistant, and Amazon Alexa.

=== Web-based ===

A relatively new development in the field is web-based applications like Spoken-Web that act as web portals, managing content like news updates, weather, science and business articles for visually-impaired or blind computer users. Other examples are ReadSpeaker or BrowseAloud that add text-to-speech functionality to web content. The primary audience for such applications is those who have difficulty reading because of learning disabilities or language barriers. Although functionality remains limited compared to equivalent desktop applications, the major benefit is to increase the accessibility of said websites when viewed on public machines where users do not have permission to install custom software, giving people greater &quot;freedom to roam&quot;.

This functionality depends on the quality of the software but also on a logical structure of the text. Use of headings, punctuation, presence of alternate attributes for images, etc. is crucial for a good vocalization. Also a web site may have a nice look because of the use of appropriate two dimensional positioning with CSS but its standard linearization, for example, by suppressing any CSS and Javascript in the browser may not be comprehensible.

== Customization ==

Most screen readers allow the user to select whether most punctuation is announced or silently ignored. Some screen readers can be tailored to a particular application through scripting. One advantage of scripting is that it allows customizations to be shared among users, increasing accessibility for all. JAWS enjoys an active script-sharing community, for example.

=== Verbosity ===

Verbosity is a feature of screen reading software that supports vision-impaired computer users. Speech verbosity controls enable users to choose how much speech feedback they wish to hear. Specifically, verbosity settings allow users to construct a mental model of web pages displayed on their computer screen. Based on verbosity settings, a screen-reading program informs users of certain formatting changes, such as when a frame or table begins and ends, where graphics have been inserted into the text, or when a list appears in the document. The verbosity settings can also control the level of descriptiveness of elements, such as lists, tables, and regions. For example, JAWS provides low, medium, and high web verbosity preset levels. The high web verbosity level provides more detail about the contents of a webpage.

=== Language ===

Some screen readers can read text in more than one language, provided that the language of the material is encoded in its metadata.

Screen reading programs like JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver also include language verbosity, which automatically detects verbosity settings related to speech output language. For example, if a user navigated to a website based in the United Kingdom, the text would be read with an English accent.

<text>Gnopernicus was a free GNOME desktop application that provided Assistive Technologies (AT) for blind and visually impaired users. Gnopernicus is no longer actively developed and has been replaced by Orca in GNOME.

Gnopernicus is a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; screen reader that provided speech, Braille, and magnification for users with a range of visual impairments. Gnopernicus provided for user interface customization - including customizing the speech output and voices, customizing the keystroke commands to drive it, customizing the Braille display key input, and customizing the way magnification is rendered. It was also possible to edit the XML files that describe the speech and Braille output renderings.

Gnopernicus was bundled as the default screen reader on GNOME 2.4 on September 10, 2003; however, the development of Gnopernicus was started in 2001. Orca, with its radical different coding approach of making applications accessible, had more flexibility than the original Gnopernicus design and replaced it as the default screen reader in GNOME 2.16 in September 2006.

== Maintainers list ==
The development of Gnopernicus was led by BAUM Engineering, a partner company of Baum Retec AG.

The maintainers managed the development process with the help of many other members of the GNOME community:

* Draghi Puterity
* Remus Draica
* Dragan Sarbut
* Ada Telescu
* Oana Serb

Other developers who made great contributions to the project were Adriana Iobb, Pal Csongor Sprencz, Iuliu Szijjarto and Adi Dascal

<text>Preston Bissett is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority area of Buckinghamshire, England. It is about four miles SSW of Buckingham, six miles north east of Bicester in Oxfordshire. The soil is clay and gravel, but the subsoil varies. The parish is watered by a tributary of the River Great Ouse.

The toponym &quot;Preston&quot; is common in England; it is derived from the Old English for &quot;priest&#x27;s farm&quot;. The Domesday Book of 1086 records the village as &quot;Prestone&quot;. The affix &quot;Bissett&quot; came later and refers to the lords of the manor, distinguishing it from other places called Preston.

The village has a public house, the White Hart, a playing field, a cricket pitch, garden nurseries and a farm shop.

As of 1927, the &quot;History of the County of Buckingham&quot; described the village as &#x27;picturesque&#x27;, mainly composed of thatched cottages grouped around the parish church, which in turn stood in a churchyard on rising ground; although it reported there were &quot;a few modern residences&quot; on the east end of the village.

== Lords of the Manor ==
*The manor was held for five generations by the Barons de Ros de Hamlake. The last of these to hold the manor was Thomas de Ros, 9th Baron de Ros, a zealous Lancastrian, who was attainted in 1461, with the manor escheating to the crown.
*Sir William Fowler (MP for Wycombe) was given Preston manor in 1465 for services by his father William to King Edward IV. The manor passed in 1467 to his son,
*Sir Richard Fowler, king&#x27;s counsel and later Chancellor of the Exchequer for Edward IV
