<text>PolyGram N.V. was a multinational major music record label and entertainment company formerly based in the Netherlands. It was founded in 1962 as the Grammophon-Philips Group by Dutch corporation Philips and German corporation Siemens, to be a holding for their record companies, and was renamed &quot;PolyGram&quot; in 1972. The name was chosen to reflect the Siemens interest Polydor Records and the Philips interest Phonogram Records. The company traced its origins through Deutsche Grammophon back to the inventor of the flat disc gramophone, Emil Berliner.

Later on, PolyGram expanded into the largest global entertainment company, creating film and television divisions. In May 1998, it was sold to the alcoholic distiller Seagram which owned film, television and music company Universal Studios. PolyGram was thereby folded into Universal Music Group, and PolyGram Filmed Entertainment was folded into Universal Pictures, which had been both Seagram successors of MCA Inc. When the newly formed entertainment division of Seagram faced financial difficulties, it was sold to Vivendi, and MCA became known as Universal Studios, as Seagram ceased to exist. Vivendi remains the majority owner of the Universal Music Group (while the film and television division was sold to NBCUniversal) until 2021. In February 2017, UMG revived the company under the name of PolyGram Entertainment, which currently serves as their film and television division.

== History ==
=== Hollandsche Decca Distributie (HDD), 1929–1950 ===
In 1929, Decca Records (London) licensed record shop owner H.W. Van Zoelen as a distributor in the Netherlands. By 1931, his company Hollandsche Decca Distributie (HDD) had become exclusive Decca distributor for all of the Netherlands and its colonies. Over the course of the 1930s, HDD put together its own facilities for A&amp;R, recording, and manufacturing.

HDD was commercially successful during World War II because of the absence of American and British competition. Van Zoelen wanted to sell to Philips so that HDD would have sufficient financial backing when their major competitors returned after the war. This led Philips to purchase HDD in 1942.

In the mid 20th century, the majority of large recording companies manufactured both gramophones and records; Philips CEO Anton Philips noted the risk in creating gramophones without an interest in music recording and record manufacture, and that Radio Corporation of America (RCA) had merged with the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1929 for this reason. Philips&#x27; labs were developing magnetic tape and LPs, and they could support eventual new formats, although other record companies were notably unenthusiastic about experimenting with new formats.

After the war, Philips built a large factory in Doetinchem to produce 78 rpm records. Recording took place in Hilversum, whereas development took place in Eindhoven.

=== Philips Phonografische Industrie (PPI), 1950–1962 ===
In the 1940s, the record business was spread out within Philips: research in the Eindhoven labs, development elsewhere in Eindhoven, recording in Hilversum, manufacturing in Doetinchem, distribution from Amsterdam, and exports from Eindhoven. During the late 1940s, Philips combined its various music businesses into Philips Phonografische Industrie (PPI), a wholly owned subsidiary.

PPI&#x27;s early growth was based on alliances. A merger was first proposed with Decca of London in late 1945, but was rejected by Edward Lewis, Decca&#x27;s owner. (PolyGram finally acquired Decca in 1980.)

In the early 1950s, Philips set itself the goal of making PPI the largest record company in Europe.

PPI&#x27;s second attempt at a merger was with Deutsche Grammophon Gesellschaft (DGG). DGG, owned by Siemens AG, and well known for its classical repertoire, had been the German licensee for Decca from 1935. DGG also owned Polydor Records. Shortly after PPI was founded it had made a formal alliance with DGG to manufacture each other&#x27;s records, coordinate releases, and refrain from poaching each other&#x27;s artists or bidding against each other for new talent. PPI and DGG finally merged in 1962.

The alliance with DGG still left PPI without repertoire in Britain or the United States. But in 1951, after Columbia had failed to renew its international distribution agreement with EMI, PPI agreed to distribute Columbia recordings outside the United States. Columbia became PPI&#x27;s distributor within the US. This agreement ran until 1961 when Columbia set up its own European network. PPI signed a worldwide distribution deal with Mercury Records in 1961. PPI&#x27;s parent company Philips, through its U.S. affiliate Consolidated Electronics Industries Corp (a.k.a. Conelco), acquired Mercury in 1962.

PPI built or bought factories in smaller countries. In 1962, PPI had a large factory in Baarn and factories in France, Britain, Denmark, Norway, Spain, Italy, Egypt, Nigeria, and Brazil.

PPI played an important role in the introduction of the long-playing vinyl record to Europe. Columbia introduced their LP record in 1948, and Philips presented its first LP at a record retailers&#x27; convention in 1949. Philips&#x27; commitment to LP technology was an important factor in its 1951–1961 deal with Columbia.

=== GPG and PolyGram, 1962–1980 ===
In 1962, PPI and DGG formed the Grammophon-Philips Group (GPG) as a joint-venture holding company, with Philips taking a 50% share in DGG and Siemens a 50% share in PPI. In 1971, the UK record labels of Philips, Fontana, Mercury, and Vertigo were amalgamated into a new company called Phonogram, Ltd. In 1972, Grammophon-Philips Group reorganized all its operations and was renamed The PolyGram Group (in some countries, like Argentina, its name was Phonogram), of which Philips and Siemens each owned 50%. In 1977, both organizations merged operationally, integrating the recording, manufacturing, distribution and marketing into a single organization.

The various record labels within PolyGram continued to operate separately. PolyGram gave its labels, as A&amp;R organizations, great autonomy.

After the merger, PolyGram began to move into the US and UK markets, and did so by a process of both formation and acquisition: Polydor Records established its American operations, Polydor Incorporated in 1969, Mercury Record Productions (US) was acquired in 1972 from sister company North American Philips Corp., and became Phonogram, Inc. MGM Records and Verve (US) were acquired in 1972. Subsequent PolyGram acquisitions included those of RSO (UK) in 1975, a 50% stake in Casablanca (US) in 1977 (with the remaining 50% in 1980), Pickwick in 1978, and Decca (UK) in 1980 (the latter acquisition basically brought PolyGram full circle, see the HDD section above). PolyGram acquired United Distribution Corporation (UDC) in 1973, and changed its name to Phonodisc, Inc., and signed international distribution deals with MCA and 20th Century Records in 1976.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Philips had been at work on a new consumer magnetic tape format for music. The Philips Compact Cassette was introduced in 1963. It was small and could play longer than an LP. In 1965 the cassette accounted for 3% of revenues, growing in 1968 to 8% and in 1970 to 10.6%.

In the late 1960s, and through the 1970s, GPG/PolyGram diversified into film and television production and home video. RSO&#x27;s successes included &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; and &quot;Grease&quot;. PolyGram&#x27;s highly successful marketing during the disco craze included the Casablanca FilmWorks production &quot;Thank God It&#x27;s Friday&quot; (1978) and its associated soundtrack. During the boom in disco, PolyGram&#x27;s US market share had grown from 5% to 20%. This can also be attributed to multi-million selling albums and 45s by the Bee Gees, Donna Summer, the Village People, Andy Gibb, Kool &amp; the Gang, and rock band Kiss. For a short while in the late 1970s, it was the world&#x27;s largest record company.

In 1969, PolyGram established a direct mail-order business in the UK, Britannia Music Club, which ran till 2007.

=== Reorganization, 1980–1999 ===
Before 1978, PolyGram was losing money. When US operations were running at full capacity, PolyGram expanded aggressively, and would press large quantities of records without knowing the demand. In late 1979, PolyGram was caught off guard by the sudden end of the popularity of disco music, leaving it with an underutilized distribution network, profligate labels, and over optimistic product orders. PolyGram&#x27;s Casablanca label was known for management spending on lavish industry parties and luxury cars. After 1980, PolyGram&#x27;s losses had spiraled upwards of US$220 million.

Another contributing factor to PolyGram&#x27;s financial woes was the massive failure of the big budget musical &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Heart&#x27;s Club Band&quot; (1978). The film starred the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton at the height of their popularity, and featured the Beatles covers by them as well as Aerosmith, Billy Preston, and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. The film was highly anticipated to surpass the box office success of both the &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; and &quot;Grease&quot;, mostly due to its popular music stars. The soundtrack LP, based on only advance orders, was released triple platinum. The movie was released to poor reviews and died at the box office. Despite its triple platinum start, the soundtrack LP&#x27;s sales bombed after the film&#x27;s release. In turn, record dealers flooded PolyGram with returned LPs. The resulting losses nearly wiped out the profits the company had made on both the &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; and &quot;Grease&quot; soundtracks. The company took further loses when the disco craze ended in 1979 and record sales for both the Bee Gees and Casablanca&#x27;s Village People plummeted. PolyGram also experienced losses with the defection of Casablanca&#x27;s Donna Summer to newly formed Geffen Records as well as the dropping of Andy Gibb, whose personal problems with cocaine and alcohol began to affect his recording career, from RSO. Summer and the Bee Gees also had legal disputes with their labels which further complicated matters. Summer ended her contract with PolyGram in 1980, and was awarded the rights to her songwriting catalog by the courts; she owed them one more album, and finished out her contract by recording her album &quot;She Works Hard For The Money&quot; (from which the title track was a huge hit in 1983).

In 1980, after PolyGram bought the other 50% of Casablanca Records and Filmworks, PolyGram renamed its existing Casablanca Records &amp; Filmworks unit as PolyGram Pictures with Peter Guber becoming chairman of the company. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, PolyGram continued to invest in a diversified film unit with the purchases of individual production companies.

In 1981, Philips executive Jan Timmer became a member of the Group Management of PolyGram and was appointed president and chief executive officer of newly formed parent company, PolyGram International Ltd. in 1983. He cut the workforce from 13,000 to 7,000, reduced PolyGram&#x27;s LP and cassette plants from eighteen to five, and decreased the company&#x27;s dependence on superstars by spreading the repertoire across different genres and nurturing national and regional talent. Also by 1983, PolyGram&#x27;s U.S. roster of labels included:
* Polydor
* Mercury
* London
* London/FFRR
* Casablanca (until 1986, later to be reincarnated in 1994)
* RSO
* De-Lite
* Riva
* Threshold (owned by the Moody Blues)
* Total Experience (founded by Lonnie Simmons, from 1981 to 1984)
* Atlanta Artists (founded by Cameo lead singer Larry Blackmon)
...which were all consolidated into PolyGram Records, Inc. (now UMG Recordings, Inc.) In 1981, PolyGram launched domestic television syndication unit PolyGram Television (unrelated to the latter day incarnation that became Universal Worldwide Television in 1997), but it was soon folded after two years.

Under its newly reorganized form, PolyGram decided to discontinue Philips as a pop and rock label in the UK and much of Europe, though it was still frequently issued records in France and South East Asia, where it issued many albums and singles by Chinese and Hong Kong pop artists. The majority of PolyGram&#x27;s rock and pop music signings went to Mercury and Polydor. Philips became part of PolyGram Classics as a classical music label along with Decca Records and Deutsche Grammophon. By 1985, PolyGram had returned to profitability.

Wing Records was reincarnated in 1987 and became a very popular label over the following years, spawning the careers of Tony! Toni! Toné! and former Miss America, Vanessa Williams; the label was discontinued in the mid-1990s. Fontana was revived in the U.S. in 1989, but only for a short while. Today, Fontana Distribution is an independent label distribution unit of Universal Music Group. Vertigo Records still remained a rare U.S. PolyGram label, as most of its music was from Europe.

In April 1982, PolyGram assumed operational and managerial control of 20th Century Fox Records from its similarly named parent, which had just recently been bought out by oil magnate Marvin Davis, who was not interested in keeping the record company. The assets of the former 20th Century Fox Records were fully acquired by the firm in July 1982, and subsequently were consolidated with the Casablanca label.

After an attempted 1983 merger with Warner Elektra Atlantic failed, Philips bought 40% of PolyGram from Siemens, acquiring the remaining 10% in 1987.

In 1985, former CBS and Columbia executive Dick Asher was named president and CEO of PolyGram. Asher was formerly the attorney for Don Kirshner&#x27;s Aldon Music music publishing company.

The CD, invented by Philips and Sony, helped greatly in boosting the company&#x27;s sales and market share. PolyGram&#x27;s strength in classical music helped greatly, as many of the CD&#x27;s early adopters were classical music lovers. Total US sales of CDs were $1 million in 1983, $334 million in 1990 and $943 million in 2000. Total UK sales were $300,000 in 1983, $51 million in 1990 and $202 million in 2000. The CD increased PolyGram&#x27;s profit margin from 4-6% in the mid-1980s to 7-9% by the early 1990s. As well, videos were distributed by PolyGram Video.

In 1988, Philips acquired the remaining 50% of PolyGram from long-time partner Siemens and later in 1989, floated 16% of PolyGram on the Amsterdam stock exchange, valuing the whole company at $5.6 billion. PolyGram embarked on a new program of acquisitions, including A&amp;M and Island Records in 1989, Swedish company Polar Music which held the rights to the ABBA catalogue, Motown and Def Jam in 1994 and Rodven (Venezuela) in 1995.

In 1990, after acquiring both Island and A&amp;M, Alain Levy, (then) executive vice-president of PolyGram N.V., re-organized the U.S. operations of PolyGram Records, Inc. into a new expanded conglomerate: PolyGram Group Distribution, Inc. In addition to overseeing the sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution of music and video products created by PolyGram, PGD was also responsible for supervising a number of other divisions within PolyGram (U.S.) such as: PolyGram Music Group, PolyGram Video, PolyMedia, PolyGram Special Markets, PolyGram Merchandising, Independent Label Sales (ILS) and New Media &amp; Business Development.

PolyGram and Granada TV formed a joint venture, Big Picture Productions, in 1990 as a music programing firm which, at Cannes in 1990, purchased exclusive international distribution rights to &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; (The two-hour special featured black female performers and was hosted by Billy Dee Williams) from the New York–based Gene David Group.

In June 1991, Alain Levy was promoted to worldwide president and CEO of PolyGram N.V.

In 1993, PolyGram purchased the video arm of Virgin Group from General Electric Capital for $5.6 million and remodeled the label as Vision Video ltd.

In 1995, PolyGram purchased ITC Entertainment for $156 million.

===Sale to Seagram and divestiture (1998–1999)===
In 1996, Cor Boonstra became CEO of Philips; by the time he took over, Philips was seen as a bloated company, laden with too many layers of management and unrelated companies that they could not leverage effectively. As a result, Boonstra began to sell or dispose of various non-core assets. While Philips began to withdraw from other media activities, Boonstra denied that PolyGram was for sale. However, by early 1998, he had changed his attitude, instead deciding to pursue a manufacturing-only business plan. (In hindsight, analysts have pointed out how Philips ultimately benefitted from the manufacture and sale of blank CDs, which played a significant part in the music piracy that began to affect the industry in the early 2000s.)

After weeks of speculation, on May 22, 1998, Philips announced that they would sell PolyGram to Seagram for $10 billion. Some of the reasons cited for the deal were a lack of pop hits from the music side of the company, and an equal lack of box-office successes from the film side. Alain Levy resigned as CEO of PolyGram on June 23 to prepare for the merger, and the deal was closed on December 10, 1998, with PolyGram&#x27;s operations folding into Universal Pictures and Universal Music Group.

Seagram however, was only interested in PolyGram&#x27;s music division, and in October 1998 they announced that they would begin divesting PolyGram&#x27;s entertainment assets, while the remainder would be folded into Universal Pictures. Prior to this announcement, the company announced the sale of their 75% stake in children&#x27;s distributor Abbey Home Entertainment back to its original founders and the acquisition of Astrion plc. On October 23, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer agreed to purchase PolyGram Filmed Entertainment&#x27;s pre-April 1996 library for $250 million, which included over 1,300 films from various assets PolyGram had acquired within that point, but did not include the ITC Entertainment library, which was sold on January 19, 1999 to Carlton Communications for £91 million. On April 8, 1999, USA Networks announced they would purchase PolyGram Filmed Entertainment&#x27;s domestic division (including PolyGram Video&#x27;s US &amp; Canada operation), among other assets. After the sale, the divisions were renamed USA Films and USA Home Entertainment respectively. The assets of Slash Records and London Records were sold to Warner Music Group. What remained of PolyGram was folded into both Universal Music Group and Universal Pictures.

On February 10, 1999, Universal announced that they would pull out of their CIC Video and United International Pictures ventures with Paramount Pictures and rename PolyGram Filmed Entertainment&#x27;s international division (including PolyGram Video&#x27;s international operation) as Universal Pictures International.&lt;br&gt;Whilst the home video division rebranding was successful (with CIC being renamed Paramount Home Entertainment UK toward the end of 1999), the theatrical division rebranding would prove to be a failure, as films from the rebranded Universal Pictures International flopped at the box office, the company therefore announced in October 1999 that their operations would be downgraded to the home video market only and renewed their UIP deal with Paramount for five years, the remains of PolyGram&#x27;s theatrical assets would then be folded into United International Pictures. &quot;Mickey Blue Eyes&quot; would become the last film distributed under the ex-PolyGram unit.

The PolyGram name now survives via reissue of music under the Polydor Records label as well as a publishing arm of Universal Music Publishing Group. The Japanese branches of the PolyGram labels that were absorbed to form Universal Music Japan and were rebranded: Polydor remained until 2002, when it merged with the Universal label to form Universal J, Kitty Records and Mercury remained until 2000, when they merged and became the short-lived Kitty MME, which later in 2002, moved some artists to Universal J, and in 2004, Kitty MME became Universal Sigma.

<text>A virtual device in Unix is a file such as codice_1 or codice_2, that is treated as a device, as far as user level software is concerned, but is generated by the kernel without reference to hardware.

It is a device file (it can be made with mknod for instance), but does not reference any hardware.

<doc id="423779" wikidata="Q310450" url="?curid=423779" title="Steve Davis">
<text>Steve Davis (born 22 August 1957) is an English retired professional snooker player who is currently a commentator, DJ, electronic musician and author. He dominated professional snooker in the 1980s, when he reached eight World Snooker Championship finals in nine years, won six world titles and held the world number one ranking for seven consecutive seasons. He won 28 ranking titles during his career, placing him fifth on the all-time list, behind Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan (41), Stephen Hendry (36), John Higgins (31) and Judd Trump (30). The first player to make an officially recognised maximum break in professional competition, at the 1982 Classic, he was also the first to earn £1 million in career prize money. He is the only snooker player to have won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award, which he received in 1988. 

Davis became widely known for his role in one of snooker&#x27;s most famous matches, the 1985 World Championship final. Then the defending champion, he took an 8–0 lead over Dennis Taylor in the best-of-35-frame final, but Taylor recovered to tie the scores at 11–11, 15–15 and 17–17. The 68-minute deciding frame ended in a dramatic battle on the last black ball that attracted 18.5 million viewers in the UK, still the largest British television audience for any broadcast after midnight and any broadcast on BBC Two. Taylor potted the black to win the only world title of his career. Davis&#x27;s terse responses in his post-match interview became the basis for a recurring caricature on the satirical British television show &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, which gave him the sardonic nickname &quot;Interesting&quot;.

In addition to his six world titles, Davis won the UK Championship six times and the Masters three times for a total of 15 Triple Crown titles, placing him third behind O&#x27;Sullivan (23) and Hendry (18). During the 1987–88 season, he became the first player to win all three Triple Crown events in a single season, a feat that only two other players, Hendry and Mark Williams, have since matched. He won his last major title at the 1997 Masters, aged 39, but continued to compete at a high level and was still a top-16 ranked player at age 50. He made the last of his 30 Crucible appearances in 2010, aged 52, when he eliminated the defending world champion John Higgins to become the oldest world quarter-finalist since 1983. He retired at the end of the 2015–16 season, after 38 seasons on the professional tour, but remains active as a commentator and analyst for the BBC&#x27;s snooker coverage. He was made an MBE in the 1988 Birthday Honours and elevated to OBE in the 2000 New Year Honours.

Outside snooker, Davis competed in nine-ball pool tournaments, which included representing Europe in the Mosconi Cup eleven consecutive times between 1994 and 2004. A keen chess and poker player, he served as president of the British Chess Federation between 1996 and 2001 and competed in televised poker tournaments. In 2013, he featured as a contestant on &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, an ITV reality television series. A fan of progressive rock, he has an ongoing career as a radio broadcaster, club DJ and musician; with Kavus Torabi and Michael J. York, he co-founded the electronic music band the Utopia Strong, with which he has recorded two albums. He has authored and co-authored books on snooker, chess, cooking and music, as well as three autobiographies.

==Career==
===Early career (1970–1979)===
Davis was born on 22 August 1957 in Plumstead, London, the elder of two boys; Keith being his younger brother. Davis&#x27;s father Bill, a keen player, introduced him to snooker at the age of 12 and took him to play at his local working men&#x27;s club. Bill gave Steve an instructional book: &quot;How I Play Snooker&quot; by the unrelated Joe Davis. They studied the book, Davis later basing his technique on it during the 1970s. He began playing at the Lucania Snooker Club in Romford. The club manager brought his talent to the attention of Barry Hearn (chairman of the Lucania chain of snooker halls) when Davis was 18 and Hearn became his friend and manager. Paid £25 a match by Hearn, Davis toured the United Kingdom and participated in challenge matches against established professionals such as Ray Reardon, John Spencer and Alex Higgins. Around this time he was nicknamed &quot;Nugget&quot; because, according to Hearn, &quot;you could put your case of money on him and you knew you were going to get paid.&quot;

Davis won the English Under-19 Billiards Championship in 1976. One of his last wins as a snooker amateur was against Tony Meo, another future professional, in the final of the 1978 Pontins Spring Open. He defended his title a year later, defeating future rival Jimmy White 7–4 in the final. Davis applied in 1978 to become a professional and was initially rejected, before being accepted with effect from 17 September 1978, becoming the youngest of the professional players. He made his professional television debut on Pot Black, where he played against Fred Davis. He played in his first World Snooker Championship in 1979, having won two qualifying matches, but lost 11–13 to Dennis Taylor in the first round proper.

===Early success (1980–1984)===
At the 1980 World Snooker Championship he reached the quarter-finals, defeating Patsy Fagan and defending champion Terry Griffiths before losing to Alex Higgins 9–13. He won his first major title that year, the 1980 UK Championship, beating Griffiths 9–0 in the semi-finals and Higgins 16–6 in the final. After winning his first title, he won the Wilson&#x27;s Classic in 1980, the Yamaha Organs and English Professional in 1981, and was the bookmakers&#x27; favourite to win the 1981 World Snooker Championship despite being seeded 13th. Davis reached the final by defeating White in the first round, Higgins in the second round, Griffiths in the quarter-finals and defending champion Cliff Thorburn in the semi-final. In the final, he won 18–12 against Doug Mountjoy to take his first world championship. 

Davis completed a 9–0 whitewash victory over Dennis Taylor in the International Open final and retained the UK Championship with a 16–3 win over Griffiths in the final, winning five events in 1981. In January 1982, Davis compiled the first televised maximum break at the Classic at Queen Elizabeth Hall in Oldham against John Spencer. As Lada were sponsoring the event, they offered Davis a car for completing the break. He reached the final, but lost 8–9 to Griffiths in the final. However, later that month Davis defeated Griffiths 9–5 in the Masters final, to win his first title.

His 18-month period of dominance ended at the 1982 World Snooker Championship, where he lost 1–10 to Tony Knowles in the first round. Despite this, he finished the season as the world number one for the first time. Davis lost to Griffiths in the quarter-finals of the 1982 UK Championship later that year. After those two defeats, he won the World Doubles Championship with partner Tony Meo. He overcame Thorburn 18–6 in the 1983 World Snooker Championship, regaining the title with a in the final. Davis led 7–0 against Higgins in the 1983 UK Championship final, but lost on a 15–16. At the 1984 World Snooker Championship, he was the first player to retain his title at the Crucible Theatre – the event&#x27;s venue since 1977 – by defeating Jimmy White 18–16 in the final, winning his third world championship. Davis also won the 1984 UK Championship, beating Higgins 16–8 in the final.

===1985 World Snooker Championship===

At the 1985 World Snooker Championship, Davis defeated Neal Foulds, David Taylor, Griffiths and Reardon en route to the championship final, where his opponent was Dennis Taylor. Davis won all of the frames in the first , and the first of the evening, to lead 8–0 but Taylor recovered to trail 7–9. Taylor levelled the match for the first time at 11–11; after Davis took the lead again, Taylor fought back a second time from 12–15 to level at 15–15 and a third time from 15–17 to 17–17, forcing a deciding frame. With the scores close, Taylor potted the final to leave the . With Davis leading 62–59 in the frame at that point, the player who potted the black ball would win the championship. After several failed attempts to pot it by each player, Taylor potted the ball to win the title. The final was watched by 18.5 million viewers, setting all-time records for BBC Two and for a post-midnight audience on British television. The final, later called the &quot;black ball final&quot;, was voted the ninth-greatest sporting moment of all time in a 2002 Channel 4 poll; Davis&#x27;s disbelief and Taylor&#x27;s triumphant, pointing finger have been replayed many times on television.

===Later World Snooker Championship victories (1985–1989)===
Davis and Taylor met again in the final of the 1985 Grand Prix, but this time Davis won in a deciding frame. At 10 hours 21 minutes, it was the longest one-day final in snooker history. Davis trailed Willie Thorne 8–13 in the 1985 UK Championship final. Thorne missed a off the spot, which would have given him a 14–8 lead; Davis won the frame and seven of the next eight to win 16–14. Davis also won the 1986 British Open, with a 12–7 win over Thorne. At the 1986 World Championship, Davis defeated White 13–5 in the quarter-finals and Thorburn 16–12 in the semi-finals. His opponent in the final was Joe Johnson, who started the tournament as an outsider to win, with odds of 150–1. Davis lost the match, 12–18. At the end of 1986, he beat Foulds 16–7 to retain the 1986 UK Championship.

Davis began 1987 by winning the Classic 13–12 against defending champion Jimmy White. At the 1987 World Snooker Championship, he defeated Griffiths 13–5 in the quarter-final and White 16–11 in the semi-final. Meeting Johnson again in the final, he established a 14–10 lead after three sessions. Johnson reduced Davis&#x27;s lead to 14–13, but Davis took four of the next five frames to win the match 18–14 and regain the title, his fourth world championship. In December he retained his UK title with a 16–14 win against White in the final. Davis retained the Classic in 1988 before claiming his second Masters title: in the final he completed a 9–0 whitewash of Mike Hallett, the only such result in the event&#x27;s history. He also won the World Cup with England and secured his fourth Irish Masters title. In that year&#x27;s World Championship Davis defeated Hallett 13–1, Tony Drago 13–4 and Thorburn 16–8 en route to the final, where he met Griffiths. Davis established a 5–2 lead after the first session, but Griffiths levelled at 8–8 after the second. On the second day of the match, Davis took ten out of thirteen frames to win his fifth world title 18–11.

He won the first ranking event of the 1988–89 snooker season, a 12–6 victory over White in the International Open. During the same match, Davis became the first player to make three consecutive century breaks in a major tournament. In October, he won the Grand Prix final 10–6 against Alex Higgins and held the World, UK, Masters, Grand Prix, Classic and Irish Masters titles simultaneously. His four-year unbeaten run in the UK Championship ended in December with a 3–9 semi-final loss to Hendry. Davis did not win another major title until the 1989 World Championship, where he beat Hendry 16–9 in the semi-finals before the most decisive victory in a world final of the modern era: an 18–3 win against John Parrott, for his sixth world championship. He retained the Grand Prix in October, beating Dean Reynolds 10–0 in the final – the first whitewash in a ranking-event final. By the end of the 1980s, Davis was snooker&#x27;s first millionaire.

===Last ranking event win (1990–1995)===
Davis began the 1990s by winning the Irish Masters for the fifth time, defeating Taylor 9–4.
Davis was denied an eighth consecutive appearance in the 1990 World Snooker Championship final by Jimmy White, who won their semi-final 16–14. He was succeeded as world number one by new world champion Stephen Hendry, at the end of the 1989–90 snooker season, Davis having held the spot for seven consecutive seasons. The following season, Davis reached the final of the UK Championship again and played Hendry, losing on a deciding frame 15–16. Davis won the Irish Masters again, defeating Parrott 9–5 in the final. At the world championship, Davis reached the semi-final but lost to Parrott 16–10.

Davis won the Classic, defeating Hendry 9–8, and then won the Asian Open by beating Alan McManus 9–3. He did not win a match at the 1992 World Snooker Championship, however, as he was beaten 4–10 by Peter Ebdon, the first time he had lost in the opening round in nine years. He won the European Open in 1993 where he completed a 10–4 victory against Hendry in the final. Davis won a seventh Irish Masters event in 1993, where he defeated McManus 9–4. At the 1993 World Snooker Championship, Davis defeated Ebdon, who had defeated him the year previously 10–3, but lost again to McManus in the second round 13–11. Davis won his eighth (and final) Irish Masters event in 1994 with a deciding frame win over McManus. Davis progressed past the second round for the first time in three years at the 1994 World Snooker Championship, defeating Dene O&#x27;Kane, Steve James and Wattana but was defeated by Hendry 9–16 in the semi-final. Over the next two seasons, Davis won consecutive Welsh Open titles. At the 1994 event, he completed three consecutive whitewash 5–0 victories and won the final 9–6 over McManus. The following season at the 1995 event, he defeated John Higgins 9–3 in the final. This victory was his last ranking title of his career.

===Masters champion for the last time (1996–2000)===
In 1996, Davis reached the quarter-finals of both the Masters and World Championship, losing to McManus and Ebdon, respectively. The following year, at the 1997 Masters, Davis reached the final, defeating McManus, Ebdon and Doherty. Trailing O&#x27;Sullivan 4–8 in the final, Davis won six frames in a row, securing a 10–8 victory. The win was Davis&#x27;s last fully professional title of his career, his third Masters title. At the world championship later that year, Davis defeated David McLellan in the opening round, before losing to Doherty 3–13. He also reached the second round in the 1998 event, where he defeated Simon Bedford, but lost to Williams 6–13.

For the 1998–99 season, Davis&#x27;s best result was reaching the quarter-finals at the 1998 UK Championship, the first time he had progressed past the third round in five years, but lost to Paul Hunter. He also reached the same stage at the 1999 Welsh Open, but lost to Williams. However, at the 1999 World Snooker Championship, he was unable to win a match, losing in the first round on a deciding frame to Joe Perry. He did reach the quarter-finals of the 1999 British Open in 1999–2000, but only won one match at the 2000 World Snooker Championship, defeating Graeme Dott, but losing to Higgins 11–13. After this loss, Davis fell out of the top 16 in the world rankings for the 2000–01 season for the first time since 1980 and would not play in the Masters for the first time since he first qualified.

===Fall out of the top 16 (2000–2005)===
Davis&#x27;s best result during the season was a quarter-final appearance at the 2001 Irish Masters losing to O&#x27;Sullivan. Davis failed to qualify for the 2001 World Snooker Championship, losing 6–10 to Andy Hicks in the last qualifying round. This was the first time Davis would be absent from the event since his debut in 1979. After the loss, he contemplated retirement, but said that it would be the &quot;easy thing to do&quot;. Since he still enjoyed the challenge of professional play he continued into the 2001–02 snooker season and reached the semi-finals of the 2002 LG Cup and the quarter-finals of the 2003 Irish Masters the following season. However, Davis was unable to qualify for the 2002 World Snooker Championship, losing 8–10 to Robin Hull in the final round of qualification.

Despite this, his previous results were enough to regain his place in the top 16 for the 2003–2004 season, starting ranked 11th in the world. Despite not progressing past the third round in any other events, Davis reached the final at the 2004 Welsh Open. This was nine years after he last won a ranking event at the 1995 Welsh Open. He defeated Mark King, Higgins, Milkins and Marco Fu and met O&#x27;Sullivan in the final. In the best of 17 frames match, he led 8–5, but lost 8–9. He reached the quarter-finals of the 2005 World Snooker Championship, losing to eventual winner Shaun Murphy.

===Later career (2005–2010)===

Davis reached his 100th major career final at the 2005 UK Championship in York, his first appearance in the event&#x27;s final since 1990. He beat defending champion Stephen Maguire and Hendry before he lost 6–10 to Ding Junhui in the final. Davis brushed off suggestions of retirement before the World Championships, and reached the second round where he lost to Murphy. His performances during the 2006–07 season, including reaching the 2006 UK Championship quarter-finals and the Welsh Open semi-finals, ensured that Davis was still a top-16 player at the age of 50. Although Davis dropped out of the top sixteen a year later, he reached successive quarter-finals at the Shanghai Masters and Grand Prix in 2008. At the 2009 World Snooker Championship, Davis lost 2–10 to Neil Robertson in the first round. At the 2009 UK Championship, he defeated Michael Judge 9–7 to set up a first-round match against Hendry which he lost 6–9.

He qualified for the 2010 World Snooker Championship, his 30th time at the event, by defeating Adrian Gunnell 10–4. In the first round, Davis beat Mark King 10–9; at 52, he was the oldest player to win a match at the Crucible since Eddie Charlton defeated Cliff Thorburn in 1989. In the second round, against defending champion John Higgins, Davis won 13–11, a win commentator Clive Everton called &quot;the greatest upset in the 33 years the Crucible has been hosting the championship.&quot; This made him the oldest world quarter-finalist since Charlton in 1983. In the quarter-final match against Australian Neil Robertson, Davis lost 5–13. Despite having his best run at the World Championship for five years and reaching the quarter-finals for only the second time since 1994, this was his last appearance at the Crucible; he failed to qualify for the tournament again before his retirement. O&#x27;Sullivan equalled Davis&#x27;s record of 30 Crucible appearances in 2022.

Davis participated in the Players Tour Championship in 2010; his best result was at the Paul Hunter Classic, where he reached the quarter-finals before losing 1–4 to Shaun Murphy. He finished 67th on the Order of Merit. He reached the final of the 2010 World Seniors Championship, losing 1–4 to Jimmy White. He narrowly reached the last qualifying round of the 2011 World Snooker Championship by defeating Jack Lisowski 10–9 before losing 2–10 to Stephen Lee.

===Retirement (2010–2016)===

Davis began the 2011–12 season ranked world number 44, his lowest ranking position since turning professional. He reached the final of the 2011 World Seniors Championship, where he lost 1–2 to Darren Morgan. He participated in the 2011–12 Players Tour Championship; his best result was in the Warsaw Classic, where he reached the semi-finals before losing 3–4 to Ricky Walden, and finished at number 26 on the Order of Merit. He qualified for the 2011 UK Championship by defeating Ian McCulloch and Andrew Higginson, but lost 1–6 in the first round to O&#x27;Sullivan. He reached the last 16 of the Welsh Open, losing 0–4 to Murphy. Davis did not qualify for the main stage of the World Snooker Championship, losing 7–10 to Ben Woollaston.

He qualified for the 2012 Shanghai Masters, where he lost 4–5 to Walden; he then qualified for the final stages of the 2012 UK Championship, but lost in the first round 2–6 to Ali Carter. He again participated in the Players Tour Championship; his best results were in the Kay Suzanne Memorial Trophy and the Scottish Open, where he reached the last 16 before losing 3–4 to John Higgins and 1–4 to Ding Junhui. He placed 52nd on the tour&#x27;s Order of Merit. He finished the season in the qualifying stage of the World Championship, losing 7–10 to Maflin. He won his first World Seniors Championship in 2013 by defeating Nigel Bond, 2–1. After being beaten by Craig Steadman 8–10 in the second round of the 2014 World Snooker Championship qualification, Davis finished the season outside the top 64 on the money list and dropped off the main professional tour after 36 years.

Davis received an invitational tour card for tournaments in the 2014–15 season. He played in the 2014 Champion of Champions event after qualifying with the 2013 World Seniors Championship, losing 1–4 to Mark Selby in the group semi-final. He entered the 2016 World Snooker Championship qualifiers but lost to Fergal O&#x27;Brien in his last professional match. During a live BBC broadcast on 17 April 2016, Davis announced his retirement from professional snooker, citing the recent death of his father as the main reason. He entered the Crucible Theatre holding the World Championship trophy and received a standing ovation from the audience. Over the course of his career, Davis won over £5.5 million in prize money. , he continues to play exhibitions and is a pundit and commentator for the BBC&#x27;s snooker coverage of Triple Crown events.

==Other sports==

From 1994 to 2007, Davis regularly participated in professional nine-ball pool events; he was instrumental in creating the Mosconi Cup, an annual nine-ball pool tournament contested between teams representing Europe and the United States. He represented Europe in the tournament eleven times and was a member of the victorious 1995 and 2002 teams; his victory against the US&#x27;s Earl Strickland clinched the 2002 competition for Europe. In 2001, Davis reached the final of his first pool event at the World Pool League before losing 9–5 to Efren Reyes. Sky Sports commentator Sid Waddell gave him the nickname &quot;Romford Slim&quot;, calling him Britain&#x27;s answer to American pool player Rudolf &quot;Minnesota Fats&quot; Wanderone. Davis dislikes blackball pool as played on English-style tables in British pubs and clubs, considering it a &quot;Mickey Mouse game&quot; when played with a smaller cue ball than the other balls, although he is happy with the game when played with uniform balls.

At the 2000 WPA World Nine-ball Championship, Davis was seeded 63rd. In the round of 64, he trailed second seed and reigning world champion Efren Reyes 2–8, but won the match 9–8. He defeated two other former world champions, Ralf Souquet 9–6 in the last 32 and Kunihiko Takahashi 11–6 in the last 16, but lost 7–11 in the quarter-finals to Corey Deuel.

He reached the last 16 of the 2003 WPA World Nine-ball Championship in Cardiff, Wales, where he faced three-time champion Strickland. The match was notable for the behaviour of its players. Strickland accused members of the crowd of bias towards Davis; when warned by referee Michaela Tabb, he told her to &quot;shut up&quot;. He complained after Davis took a second toilet break (when only allocated one), and Davis later admitted that the second break was gamesmanship against his opponent. Strickland won the match and proceeded to the semi-finals.

Davis has become a proficient poker player, with successful appearances at televised tournaments; they included an appearance at the final table of the 2003 Poker Million with Jimmy White, who eventually won. He finished 579th at event 41 of the 2006 World Series of Poker, winning $20,617. At event 54 of the 2008 World Series of Poker, Davis finished 389th and won $28,950. He finished 131st, winning $5,491, at event 56 of the 2010 World Series of Poker. At event 22 of the 2011 Grand Poker Series, Davis finished eighth and won $2,049.

A keen chess player, he served as president of the British Chess Federation from 1996 until 2001. Davis co-authored &quot;Steve Davis Plays Chess&quot;, a 1995 book.

==In other media==
Davis has become known for his coolness and conduct in high-pressure situations. His initial lack of emotional expression and monotonous interview style earned him a reputation as boring, and the satirical television series &quot;Spitting Image&quot; nicknamed him &quot;Interesting&quot;. Davis has since played on this image and says it helped him gain public acceptance. He co-authored the 1988 book &quot;How to Be Really Interesting&quot; with Geoff Atkinson, a comedy writer who had been a key part of Spitting Image&#x27;s writing team.

Davis worked with a series of video games. He appeared in a spoof online promotion for the Nintendo DS game &quot;World Snooker Championship: Season 2007–08&quot;, parodying a Nicole Kidman Brain Training advertisement, and worked with the &quot;World Snooker Championship&quot; franchise and &quot;Virtual Snooker&quot;. He also gave his name to two video games, &quot;Steve Davis Snooker&quot; in 1984 and &quot;Steve Davis World Snooker&quot; in 1989. In 2010, Davis played himself on &quot;The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret&quot;; other television appearances include the Christmas 1981 episode of &quot;The Morecambe &amp; Wise Show&quot;.

Davis has published a number of other books. Five relate to snooker: &quot;Successful Snooker&quot; (1982), &quot;Frame and Fortune&quot; (1982), &quot;Steve Davis: Snooker Champion&quot; (1983), &quot;Matchroom Snooker&quot; (1988) and &quot;The Official Matchroom 1990 Snooker Special&quot;. He co-authored two chess books in 1995 with David Norwood: &quot;Steve Davis Plays Chess&quot; and &quot;Grandmaster Meets Chess Amateur&quot;. Davis wrote three 1994 cookbooks: &quot;Simply Fix – the Steve Davis Interesting Cookbook No 1 – Interesting Things to Do With Meat&quot;, &quot;Simply Fix – The Steve Davis Interesting Cookbook No 2 – Interesting Things to Make with Poultry&quot;, and &quot;Simply Fix – the Steve Davis Interesting Cookbook No 3 – Interesting Things to Make Using Vegetables&quot;. His third autobiography, &quot;Interesting&quot;, was published in 2015. Davis co-produced a music book with Kavus Torabi titled &quot;Medical Grade Music&quot; in 2021.

He participated in the thirteenth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; in 2013, finishing in eighth place. &quot;The Rack Pack&quot;, a 2016 BBC television film about professional snooker during the 1970s and 1980s focusing on Davis&#x27;s rivalry with Alex Higgins, featured Will Merrick as Davis.

===Music===

When in the sixth form at school, Davis began listening to progressive rock and was introduced to the Canterbury scene. Interviewed in 2020, Davis said, &quot;I loved what bands like Soft Machine and Henry Cow were doing – it was challenging and very complex.&quot; Regarding Robert Wyatt, he said, &quot;...one album in my collection that I would strong urge everyone to get is &quot;Rock Bottom&quot;. It&#x27;s the type of album that you have to hear when you&#x27;re smashed out of your face. It is just an incredible record. Davis is a fan of French progressive rock band Magma and produced a London concert so he could see them, which led to their re-formation. He has a record collection with around 2,000 albums.

He joined Chas &amp; Dave and several other snooker stars (as the Matchroom Mob) on &quot;Snooker Loopy&quot;, a 1986 novelty record which was a Top 10 hit in the UK Singles Chart. A year later they released &quot;Romford Rap&quot;, a follow-up single which reached number 91 on the UK charts.

Davis joined Brentwood community radio station Phoenix FM in 1996, broadcasting a variety of soul and rock shows during the next ten years online and on FM under a Restricted Service Licence. When the station went full-time on FM in March 2007, he hosted &quot;The Interesting Alternative Show&quot;. As a result of his broadcasts, Davis was a guest presenter on BBC Radio 6 Music in 2011. Davis adopted &quot;Thunder Muscle&quot; as his stage name – the energy drink brand from the television series &quot;The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret&quot;, where he played a fictional version of himself promoting the product. He also used the stage name &quot;Rocky Flame&quot;. He branched out into club work in 2015 and has regular slots at London bars and nightclubs. Davis performed with Kavus Torabi at the 2016 Glastonbury Festival; their collaboration led to the formation of the Utopia Strong, an electronic music band whose debut album was released on 13 September 2019. In March 2023, Davis undertook a UK tour with the Utopia Strong in support of The Steve Hillage Band. He played analogue modular synthesiser on two free-form pieces each night totalling 30 mins.

In September 2021, Davis appeared in a music video for a track titled &quot;Lily&quot; from the upcoming Richard Dawson and Circle collaborative album.

==Legacy==
Davis won a record 84 professional titles and was the runner-up in 38 events, with 28 of these as ranking event victories. His modern-era record of six world titles has been broken by both Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan, and his six UK Championship titles has been bettered only by O&#x27;Sullivan. Davis compiled 338 competitive centuries during his career. He was coached by Frank Callan for much of his career, who also represented Hendry in the 1990s. In 2011, Davis was inducted into World Snooker&#x27;s new Hall of Fame with seven other former world champions. In the book &quot;Masters of the Baize&quot;, a detailed comparison and ranking of snooker professionals, Luke Williams and Paul Gadsby rated Davis as the third-greatest snooker player of all time (behind Joe Davis and Hendry).

Davis was one of the first professional players to play in China, touring through the 1980s. This, along with highly lucrative off-table endorsements, both set up by Hearn, allowed him to become the United Kingdom&#x27;s highest paid sportsperson in the later half of the 1980s. During the 2010 world championship, to mark the anniversary of the 1985 world championship final, Davis appeared with Taylor before the beginning of the first semi-final to stage a humorous re-enactment of their historic final frame; Taylor entered the arena wearing a pair of comically oversized glasses and Davis arrived sporting a red wig.

== Personal life and honours ==
In 1988, Davis became the only snooker player named as the BBC Sports Personality of the Year, and was made an MBE. He was made an OBE in 2000, and has been honorary president of the Snooker Writers&#x27; Association. Although he was on the board of Leyton Orient F.C., he has been a Charlton Athletic F.C. fan most of his life. 

Davis married flight attendant Judith (née Greig) in 1990. They had two sons together, Greg (born in 1991) and Jack (born in 1993). In 1995, a British tabloid newspaper paid a 19-year-old dancer £32,000 to publish her allegations that Davis had had an extramarital affair with her. Davis and his wife divorced in 2005. At age 47, Davis began a relationship with 31-year-old accounts worker Jeannie Nash, who became his long-term partner. In 2012, Davis&#x27;s son Greg entered Q-School with the aim of winning a place on the professional snooker tour, but failed to do so.

<text>Denise Michelle Crosby (born November 24, 1957) is an American actress and model known for portraying Security Chief Tasha Yar mainly in season one of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, and Yar&#x27;s daughter, the half-Romulan Commander Sela, in subsequent seasons. She is also known for her numerous film and television roles, and for starring in and producing the 1997 film &quot;Trekkies&quot;.

==Early life==
Denise Crosby&#x27;s paternal grandfather was Bing Crosby and her father was Bing&#x27;s son, Dennis Crosby.

Crosby graduated in 1975 from Hollywood High School, followed by Cabrillo College, where she studied theater. She dropped out of college after she was interviewed by a local paper and revealed her famous family background: &quot;One of the drama teachers used the story to illustrate to the class that this crap is what Hollywood&#x27;s all about, using people&#x27;s names to get somewhere. I was very, very hurt by it. So I just checked out.&quot; She started modeling and, in 1979, posed nude for the March issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, which she called &quot;some kind of rebellion on my part, some way of saying screw you to the family image&quot;.

==Career==
Crosby&#x27;s choice of career solidified at an early age and was influenced by her grandfather Bing Crosby and her father, Dennis Crosby. Crosby&#x27;s first high-profile role was as Lisa Davis on the soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. She has appeared as Dr. Gretchen Kelly in three episodes of &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, and as a sheriff on &quot;The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.&quot; episode &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;.

In the early 1990s, she played the role of the mayor in the short-lived series &quot;Key West&quot;. She also appeared in two episodes of the cable television series &quot;Red Shoe Diaries&quot;, playing a different character in each episode. Crosby had a small recurring role in Aaron Spelling&#x27;s primetime drama, &quot;Models Inc&quot;, a spin-off from &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. She was a guest star on the eighth season of &quot;The X-Files&quot; for two episodes, in which she plays a doctor who examined Agent Scully&#x27;s baby. In 1991, she was a guest star in &quot;The Deadly Nightshade&quot;, a first-season &quot;The Flash&quot; episode as Dr. Rebecca Frost.

In 2001, Crosby appeared in two episodes of &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; as the abrasive Lieutenant Susan Dalto. In 2006, she was a guest star in &quot;Popping Cherry&quot;, the third episode of the first season of &quot;Dexter&quot;, appearing via flashback as Dexter Morgan&#x27;s first victim. Crosby had a recurring role in &quot;Southland&quot; as Detective Dan &quot;Sal&quot; Salinger&#x27;s wife.

One of her first film appearances was in the 1982 Nick Nolte/Eddie Murphy film &quot;48 Hrs.&quot; This was followed by a small role in the 1982 film &quot;Trail of the Pink Panther&quot;, which she reprised in the sequel &quot;Curse of the Pink Panther&quot;. In 1985, Crosby appeared in the music videos for Chris Isaak&#x27;s song &quot;Dancin&#x27;&quot; and Michael McDonald&#x27;s song &quot;No Lookin&#x27; Back&quot;. In 1986, she appeared in the music video for Black Sabbath&#x27;s song &quot;No Stranger to Love&quot;. In the same year, she played a robotics engineer, Nora Hunter, in the science-fiction movie &quot;Eliminators&quot;. She starred in Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Pet Sematary&quot;, played the lead role in &quot;Dolly Dearest&quot; in 1991, and also appeared in &quot;Deep Impact&quot; and Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;. Her other film roles included the 2002 Western horror film &quot;Legend of the Phantom Rider&quot;, and the 2005 Tobe Hooper horror film &quot;Mortuary&quot;.

===&quot;Star Trek&quot;===

In 1987, Crosby was cast in the role of Tasha Yar for the much-publicized return of &quot;Star Trek&quot; to television in the syndicated series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. She had been chosen to play Counselor Deanna Troi before Gene Roddenberry switched the roles that Marina Sirtis and she had originally been given. Initially one of the top-billed characters and featured prominently in episodes such as &quot;The Naked Now&quot; and &quot;Code of Honor&quot;, the role of Tasha gradually moved into the background as other members of the ensemble cast became a greater focus of the series. Crosby reportedly grew disillusioned with her role because of its &quot;Uhura-like&quot; status: &quot;I was struggling with not being able to do much with the character. I had all these ideas and couldn&#x27;t do them. I was just stage dressing.&quot; Ultimately, Crosby decided to leave the show. Her character was killed by the alien creature Armus during the episode &quot;Skin of Evil&quot;. She had appeared in 22 episodes when she left.

In later years, Crosby approached the &quot;TNG&quot; production team with the idea of reprising her role of Tasha Yar. This came to be in season-three&#x27;s &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Enterprise&quot;, in which an alternate timeline is created after the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-C, the predecessor to TNG&#x27;s USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D, comes forward 22 years in time, just before it was to be destroyed. Yar joined the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-C before it returned to its own time to restore the original timeline. During the documentary &quot;Trekkies&quot;, Crosby commented that her Tasha Yar character had to die to get &quot;the best episodes&quot;.

Crosby also guest-starred in several other &quot;TNG&quot; episodes, including &quot;Redemption&quot; and &quot;Unification&quot; as Romulan Commander Sela, the half-human, half-Romulan daughter of Tasha Yar, who had been taken prisoner in the past while on board the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-C. Crosby later reprised the role in the &quot;Star Trek: Armada&quot; video game, and played Tasha again in the series finale, &quot;All Good Things...&quot;, in which Captain Picard is moving back and forth through time, and encounters Tasha during the events just prior to the pilot episode.
Crosby co-produced and narrated the 1997 documentary &quot;Trekkies&quot;, followed by the 2003 sequel &quot;Trekkies 2&quot;. Both films star Crosby, who conducts interviews with devotees of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, more commonly known as &quot;Trekkies&quot;. , she was reportedly working on a sequel called &quot;Trekkies 3&quot;.

Along with other &quot;Star Trek&quot; actors, she has also appeared in the &quot;Blood and Fire&quot; episode of the fan-produced series &quot;Star Trek: New Voyages&quot;, playing Dr. Jenna Yar (grandmother of Tasha Yar).

In 2013, Crosby provided voicing for the characters of Tasha Yar and Sela in the Cryptic Studios MMORPG &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;. Crosby became the first of a new wave of several &quot;Star Trek&quot; alumni to return to the roles they originated since Leonard Nimoy&#x27;s participation at the game&#x27;s launch in 2010.

===Post-&quot;Star Trek&quot; work===
In January and February 2010, Crosby performed alongside Gale Harold and ex-model Claudia Mason in Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot; at Theater in Los Angeles. The production and cast received mostly positive reviews in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, which stated, &quot;Harold, ideally cast, beautifully ignites with Crosby, whose unconventional interpretation is an affecting revelation.&quot;

Crosby has a recurring role on Showtime&#x27;s 2013 series &quot;Ray Donovan&quot;. In 2014, she appeared in three episodes of AMC&#x27;s &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; as Mary, a member of a group of cannibals. The character first appears in the penultimate episode of season four, &quot;Us&quot;, and made her final appearance in the season-five premiere, &quot;No Sanctuary&quot;.

Crosby also played the role of widow Margie Curtis in the TV series &quot;Bones&quot;, season three, episode four, &quot;The Secret in the Soil&quot;. She played the role of Special Master Faye Richardson in the legal drama &quot;Suits&quot; in its final season.

==Personal life==
Crosby was married to Geoffrey Edwards, son of director Blake Edwards, from 1983 to 1990. She appeared in a number of her former father-in-law&#x27;s films, including &quot;10&quot;, &quot;Skin Deep&quot;, &quot;Trail of the Pink Panther&quot;, and &quot;Curse of the Pink Panther&quot;. Crosby married Ken Sylk in 1995, and they have a son, August &quot;Augie&quot; Sylk, born in 1998.

<text>The first USS &quot;Arizona&quot; was an iron-hulled, side-wheel merchant steamship. Seized by the Confederate States of America in 1862 during the American Civil War, she was captured later the same year by the United States Navy.

==SS &quot;Arizona&quot;==
SS &quot;Arizona&quot; was laid down in 1858 at the shipyard of Harlan and Hollingsworth in Wilmington, Delaware, and completed in 1859. She was intended to carry passengers and freight on a route from New Orleans to the Brazos River (in Texas) for the Southern Steamship Company but also made other voyages along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the United States.

==As &quot;Caroline&quot;==
On 15 January 1862, Confederate Maj. Gen. Mansfield Lovell seized SS &quot;Arizona&quot; at New Orleans. Her U.S. enrollment was surrendered and replaced by a Confederate Register on 17 March 1862. &quot;Arizona&quot; was converted along with several of the faster steamers seized at the same time to run the blockade to Cuba. On her first voyage to Havana, &quot;Arizona&quot; took a provisional British registry from the British consul and was renamed &quot;Caroline&quot;. She served as a blockade runner for the Confederate States of America operating from New Orleans and Mobile to Havana.

On the morning of 28 October 1862, the side-wheeler was steaming from Havana to Mobile with a cargo of munitions when she was sighted by . The Union gunboat immediately set out in pursuit of the stranger, beginning a six-hour chase. When &quot;Montgomery&quot; pulled within range of &quot;Caroline&quot;, she opened fire with her 30-pounder Parrott rifle and expended 17 shells before two hits brought the quarry to.

Two boats from the blockader rowed out to &quot;Caroline&quot; and one returned with her master, a man named Forbes, who claimed to have been bound for the neutral port of Matamoros, Mexico, not Confederate Mobile. &quot;I do not take you for running the blockade,&quot; the flag officer, with tongue in cheek, replied, &quot;but for your damned poor navigation. Any man bound for Matamoros from Havana and coming within twelve miles of Mobile light has no business to have a steamer.&quot;

==As USS &quot;Arizona&quot;==
Rear Admiral David Farragut sent the prize to Philadelphia where she was condemned by admiralty court. The Federal Government purchased her on 23 January 1863. The Navy restored her original name, &quot;Arizona&quot;, and placed her in commission on 9 March 1863, Lieutenant Daniel P. Upton in command.

Nine days later, the steamer stood down the Delaware River and headed for the Gulf of Mexico. En route south, she chased and overtook the cotton-laden sloop &quot;Aurelia&quot; off Mosquito Inlet, Florida, on 23 March, captured her and sent her to Port Royal.

Shortly before &quot;Arizona&quot; joined the West Gulf Blockading Squadron at New Orleans, Farragut had led a naval force up the Mississippi past Port Hudson to close off the flow of supplies down the Red River and across the Mississippi to Confederate armies fighting in the East. His warships met a fierce cannonade as they attempted to pass Port Hudson, and only the flagship and her consort made it safely through to the strategic stretch of the river between Port Hudson and Vicksburg.

&quot;Arizona&quot; played an important role in strengthening Farragut&#x27;s drastically reduced force and opening up communications between its commander and the rest of his squadron. From New Orleans she proceeded to Berwick Bay to join a naval force commanded by Commander Augustus P. Cook which, in cooperation with troops commanded by Major General Nathaniel P. Banks, was operating in the swampy backwaters of the Louisiana lowlands west of the Mississippi.

On 14 April, while carrying army units, she, , and attacked CSS &quot;Queen of the West&quot; on Grand Gulf, a wide and still stretch of the Atchafalaya River. A shell from USS &quot;Calhoun&quot; blew up the &quot;Queen of the West&quot; boiler and ignited the cotton lining her hull. The burning cotton-clad drifted downstream for several hours before running aground and exploding. The three Union steamers also captured 90 members of the doomed vessel&#x27;s crew who had jumped overboard to escape scalding.

Six days later, joined the same force and, working with four companies of Union infantry, took Fort Burton, a Southern battery consisting of two old siege guns emplaced at Butte La Rose, Louisiana. This victory opened a passage for Union ships – through Atchafalaya Bay and the River of the same name – connecting the gulf with the Red and Mississippi Rivers. Thus, Farragut could bypass Port Hudson with supplies, messages, and ships.

After this path was clear, &quot;Arizona&quot; entered the Red River and descended it to its mouth where she met Farragut&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Hartford&quot;. On 3 May, she was part of a three-ship reconnaissance force that ascended the Red River until it encountered heavy fire from two large Confederate steamers, &quot;Grand Duke&quot; and &quot;Mary T.&quot;, which were supported by Southern shore batteries and snipers. Since the narrow channel prevented the Union ships from maneuvering to bring their broadsides to bear on their attackers, they were compelled to retire.

As they descended, the Northern vessels met a large force led by Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter who ordered &quot;Arizona&quot; and &quot;Estrella&quot; to join him in a much more powerful drive up the Red River. He allowed , the third ship, to return to the Mississippi to report to Farragut.

The next morning, Porter&#x27;s force arrived at Fort DeRussy – an uncompleted stronghold the South had been building on the banks of the river – and found it abandoned. After partially destroying the fortifications, Porter continued on upstream to Alexandria which surrendered without resistance. Before Porter left the river, &quot;Arizona&quot; took part in a reconnaissance of the Black River, a tributary of the Red. On 10 May, she joined in an attack on Fort Beauregard at Harrisonburg, Louisiana, on the Ouachita River.

Following her return to the Mississippi, &quot;Arizona&quot; supported operations against Port Hudson which finally fell on 9 July – five days after the surrender of Vicksburg – removing the last Southern hold on the river and finally cutting the Confederacy in two.

&quot;Arizona&quot; then returned to New Orleans for repairs. During this work, Acting Master Howard Tibbito relieved Upton in command of the side-wheeler.

On 4 September, &quot;Arizona&quot; departed New Orleans and proceeded to Southwest Pass to embark 180 sharpshooters to be distributed among USS &quot;Clifton&quot;, , and herself in a forthcoming attack on Sabine Pass, Texas. She next proceeded to Atchafalaya Bay where she met her consorts and a group of Army transports, distributed her sharpshooters, and continued on to Sabine Pass.

On the morning of 8 September, the combined force crossed the bar and then split, with &quot;Sachem&quot; and &quot;Arizona&quot; advancing up the Louisiana (right) channel, and &quot;Clifton&quot; and moving forward through the Texas (left) channel. When they arrived within range of the Confederate batteries they opened fire preparatory to landing the troops. The Southern gunners held their fire until the gunboats were within close range before countering with a devastating cannonade. A shot through her boiler totally disabled &quot;Sachem&quot;, another carried away &quot;Clifton&quot;&#x27;s wheel rope, causing her to run aground under the Confederate guns. Crocker – who commanded &quot;Clifton&quot; as well as the whole naval force – fought his ship until, with ten men killed and nine others wounded, he ordered the magazine flooded to prevent its exploding, deeming it his duty &quot;to stop the slaughter by showing the white flag...&quot; &quot;Sachem&quot; also surrendered. &quot;Clifton&quot; was taken under tow by . With the loss of &quot;Clifton&quot; and &quot;Sachem&quot; firepower, the two remaining gunboats and troop transports recrossed the bar and departed for New Orleans.

The Sabine Pass expedition had, in the words of Commodore Henry H. Bell, &quot;totally failed&quot;. Nevertheless, Major General Banks reported: &quot;In all respects the cooperation of the naval authorities has been hearty and efficient...&quot;

&quot;Arizona&quot; subsequently served on blockade duty along the Texas coast, especially at Galveston.

Later in the year, yellow fever broke out on board &quot;Arizona&quot;, forcing her back to New Orleans until the ship&#x27;s company had returned to good health. During the month of November, she had made trips to Calcasieu Pass, Vermilion Bay, and Mermentau Lake on convoy and transport trips, and on 10 December she transported Captain John B. Marchand to Forts St. Philip and Jackson to investigate a mutiny. In December 1863, &quot;Arizona&quot; went to Berwick Bay and, when the rise of water permitted, entered Grand Lake and the Atchafalaya and remained there on constant blockade. In February 1864, she went to New Orleans and, when repaired, returned to Sabine Pass for blockade duty, one of 14 vessels under Captain Marchand in . That duty lasted until September 1864 when &quot;Arizona&quot; proceeded to New Orleans for repairs. There, she was fitted out for service as the flagship of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. In January 1865, Lieutenant Commander George Brown took command of the ship.

On the evening of 27 February 1865 while underway from South West Pass to New Orleans, below New Orleans, a fire broke out in the engineer&#x27;s after storeroom and spread very rapidly. Brown ordered the magazine flooded and, when no possibility of saving the ship remained, ordered the crew to the boats. Some leaped overboard and swam to shore. The vessel drifted to the west bank of the river, grounded, and burned until she exploded 35 minutes past midnight. Out of a crew of 98 on board four were missing.

==The USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Civil War Project Fund==
The USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Civil War Project Fund is a public charity incorporated in 2014 with the mission of supporting and funding the activities necessary to locate, survey and secure the wreck of the &quot;Arizona&quot;. Additionally, upon the successful identification of the wreck, the organization will work to preserve the history, artifacts and educational legacy of this vessel through various partnerships and public outreach.

<text>Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh received numerous titles, decorations and honorary appointments, both before and during his time as consort to Queen Elizabeth II. Each is listed below. Where two dates are shown, the first indicates the date of receiving the title or award (the title as Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark being given as from his birth) and the second indicates the date of its loss, renunciation or when its use was discontinued.

Prince Philip&#x27;s British honours were read out at his funeral, held in the United Kingdom, by Thomas Woodcock, Garter Principal King of Arms, as follows:
===Royal styles and titles 1947===
On 19 November 1947, the day preceding his wedding, King George VI bestowed by Letters Patent the style &quot;His Royal Highness&quot; on Philip and, on the morning of the wedding, 20 November 1947, further Letters Patent created him &quot;Duke of Edinburgh&quot;, &quot;Earl of Merioneth&quot;, and &quot;Baron Greenwich of Greenwich in the County of London&quot;. Consequently, already being a Knight of the Garter, between 19 and 20 November 1947, he bore the unusual style Lieutenant His Royal Highness Sir Philip Mountbatten and is so described in the Letters Patent of 20 November 1947.

===Debate over Prince Philip&#x27;s titles and honours===

==== Royal title ====
On the popular, but erroneous, assumption that if Philip had the style of &quot;His Royal Highness&quot; he was automatically a &quot;British&quot; Prince, media reports after his marriage to Princess Elizabeth referred to a &quot;Prince Philip&quot;, with or without reference to any ducal title. This may have been influenced by the fact that he had actually been a Prince of Greece and Denmark by birth, the use of which titles he had discontinued already. Although the princely title was omitted in the British Regency Act 1953, and in Letters Patent of November 1953 appointing Counsellors of State, it had been included in Letters Patent of 22 October 1948 conferring princely rank on children from Philip&#x27;s marriage to Elizabeth. King George VI, however, is believed to have been clear and intentional in having withheld the title of &quot;Prince&quot; from his future son-in-law.

On 3 February 1953, John Diefenbaker MP expressed to the House of Commons of Canada his desire to see Philip bear a title that alluded to the Queen&#x27;s pan-national position and put forward the suggestion of &quot;Prince of the Commonwealth&quot;. In May of the following year, U.K. Prime Minister Winston Churchill received a written suggestion from the Queen that her husband be granted the title that Diefenbaker had mentioned, or some other suitable augmentation of his style. Churchill preferred the title &quot;Prince Consort&quot;, but the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, expressed a preference for &quot;Prince of the Realm&quot;. While the Commonwealth Prime Ministers were assembled in London, Churchill was requested by the Queen to informally solicit their opinions on the matter of the Queen&#x27;s husband&#x27;s title. Canadian Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent was the only one to express &quot;misgivings&quot;, while Philip insisted to the Queen that he objected to any enhancement of his title. The Queen thereafter contacted Churchill and told him to drop the matter. In 1955, the South African Prime Minister J. G. Strijdom belatedly made it known that the South African Cabinet objected to the title &quot;Prince of the Commonwealth&quot;. When told, the Queen continued to express the wish that her husband&#x27;s position be raised, but rejected the British Cabinet&#x27;s recommendations of &quot;Prince Consort&quot; or &quot;Prince Royal&quot;. The British Cabinet then suggested simply &quot;His Royal Highness the Prince&quot;, but the Queen was advised that if she still preferred &quot;Prince of the Commonwealth&quot;, her Private Secretary could write directly to the Commonwealth Governors-General for their response, though warning that if their consent was not unanimous the proposal could not go forward.

The matter appeared left until the publication on 8 February 1957 of an article by P. Wykeham-Bourne in &quot;The Evening Standard&quot; titled: &quot;Well, is it correct to say Prince Philip?&quot; A few days following, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan reversed the advice of the Queen&#x27;s previous ministers and formally recommended that the Queen reject &quot;the Prince&quot; in favour of &quot;Prince of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot;, deleting the reference to the Commonwealth countries. Letters Patent were issued on 22 February 1957 giving the Duke the style and titular dignity of a Prince of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (omitting the wording &quot;and Her other Realms and Territories&quot;). According to the announcement in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;, he should henceforth be known as &quot;His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh&quot;, with the capitalised definite article normally restricted to the children of monarchs.

====Order of Australia====
Prince Philip&#x27;s elevation on Australia Day 2015 from Companion to Knight of the Order of Australia caused some political controversy in Australia. Prime Minister Tony Abbott&#x27;s recommendation (via Sir Peter Cosgrove) to the Queen to confer the honour was criticised by the Labor opposition leader, Bill Shorten, among others. While conservative ministers and editorials supported his award of an honour, Abbott himself later admitted to a lapse of judgement, saying the appointment was &#x27;injudicious&#x27;.

<text>BioMed Central (BMC) is a United Kingdom-based, for-profit scientific open access publisher that produces over 250 scientific journals. All its journals are published online only. BioMed Central describes itself as the first and largest open access science publisher. It was founded in 2000 and has been owned by Springer, now Springer Nature, since 2008.

== History ==
BioMed Central was founded in 2000 as part of the Current Science Group (now Science Navigation Group, SNG), a nursery of scientific publishing companies. SNG chairman Vitek Tracz developed the concept for the company after NIH director Harold Varmus&#x27;s PubMed Central concept for open-access publishing was scaled back. The first director of the company was Jan Velterop. Chemistry Central was established in 2006 and the PhysMath Central journal imprint in 2007.

In 2002, the company introduced article processing charges, and these have since been the primary source of revenue. In 2007, Yale University Libraries stopped subsidizing BioMed Central article processing charges for Yale researchers.

In October 2008, it was announced that BioMed Central (along with Chemistry Central and PhysMath Central) had been acquired by Springer Science+Business Media, the second largest STM publisher. The Chemistry Central and PhysMath Central brands have since been retired.

In November 2008, BioMed Central became an official supporting organisation of Healthcare Information For All.

Following the merger of BMC into Springer Nature, BMC journals were gradually converted to the general Springer Nature software. The software migration meant the loss of several features, often related to open science requirements, like the ability to download a machine-readable version of the paper (in XML format), direct download of PDF files and the ability to read articles without cookies.

== Journals ==
BioMed Central&#x27;s flagship journals include &quot;BMC Bioinformatics&quot;, &quot;BMC Biology&quot;, &quot;BMC Medicine&quot;, &quot;Genome Biology&quot; and &quot;Genome Medicine&quot;. It also produces the BMC Series of journals covering the fields of biology and medicine. Most of the other journals published by BioMed Central are owned and produced independently by societies and academic editorial boards, with BioMed Central providing the hosting, publishing platform and marketing.

All journals are published online; some of the flagship journals have in the past also been available as print subscriptions, such as &quot;Arthritis Research &amp; Therapy&quot;. Publications in BioMed Central journals are, immediately upon publication, released under the Creative Commons &quot;Attribution&quot; license which grants permission to reuse publications and produce derivative work. The only exceptions to this (as of 2010) were the flagship journals, which reserved rights on review and commentary content; those articles were available to purchase on a subscription or on a pay-per-view basis, becoming freely available (but not fully open access) to all after six months; however, as of January 2015, &quot;no subscription fees apply to these journals or to any articles published in them.&quot;

===Open peer review===
In 2001, BioMed Central was the first publisher to carry out open peer review as default, by openly posting named peer reviewer reports alongside published articles as part of a &#x27;pre-publication history&#x27; for all medical journals in the BMC series. , 70 BMC journals were operating fully open peer review.

===BMC Series===
The BMC Series is a collection of several dozen online research journals published by BioMed Central. Like all other BioMed Central journals, they have a policy of open access to the research articles they publish. Between them, they cover all major subject areas within biology and medicine. Two of the journals, &quot;BMC Biology&quot; and &quot;BMC Medicine&quot;, have a broad scope, and aim to publish particularly significant research. A third journal, &quot;BMC Research Notes&quot;, publishes scientifically valid research outputs that cannot be considered as full research or methodology articles across all scientific and clinical disciplines, while &quot;BMC Proceedings&quot; publishes conference proceedings and &quot;BMC Medical Research Methodology&quot; focuses on methodological approaches to healthcare research (especially methodology of epidemiological research, clinical trials and meta-analysis/systematic review). The other journals specialise on a particular subject area. Due to their free licensing, images from BMC journals can be reused in other places.

Most BMC Series journals have an impact factor. As of 2016, for the 53 journals with impact factors, &quot;BMC Biology&quot; had the highest at 7.98.

==Databases==
The company also has hosted biomedical databases, including the ISRCTN registry (previously Current Controlled Trials), a Primary Registry of clinical trials in the WHO Registry Network. The Biology Image Library and the Cases Database, a database of medical case reports, were closed in 2014. The company also provided hosting for institutional repositories of publications based on the DSpace platform under the brand Open Repository. The Open Repository activity was sold to Atmire in 2016.

<doc id="423806" wikidata="Q2723626" url="?curid=423806" title="Thebe Hypoplakia">
<text>Thebe Hypoplakia (), also Cilician Thebe () and Placian Thebe (), was a city in ancient Anatolia. Alternative names include &quot;Placia&quot;, &quot;Hypoplacia&quot; and &quot;Hypoplacian Thebe(s)&quot;, referring to the city&#x27;s position at the foot of Mount Placus. Near the local village &quot;Tepeoba&quot;.

==Geography==
Strabo places it at 60 stadia from Adramyttium. Pomponius Mela says it was between Adramyttium and Cisthene. Josef Stauber places it in Paşa Dağ, northeast of Edremit, Balıkesir, however in another previous publication he places it in Küçuk Çal Tepe. The editors of the &quot;Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World&quot; settle on a site north-northeast of Edremit.

Strabo places Thebes and Lyrnessus &quot;in what was later called the Theban plain.&quot; He highlights the fertility and richness of this plain, as do Herodotus, Xenophon, Polybius, and Livy. Historians such as Walter Leaf have speculated on its location, but have not managed to identify the plain nor the city. Strabo, without specifying the time, reports that, due to their fertility, the Theban plain was disputed by the Mysians and Lydians, and later the Greeks who colonized it coming from Aeolis and from the island of Lesbos. He adds that in his times, the second century, the plain was occupied by the people of Adramyttium.

The place name differs according to some Greek authors: Ὑποπλάκιος Θήβη. Θήβη, Θήβαι, Θήβα Πλακία, and Θῆβε.

The only mentions in the archaic and classical ages to Thebes as a &quot;polis&quot; (city-state), are connected with the Homeric tradition. However, Quintus Curtius Rufus refers to Thebes as &quot;urbs&quot;, retrospectively in the context of the fourth century BCE.

==History==
Herodotus expressly mentions Thebe in a passage from a chapter of his account of the Second Persian invasion of Greece. He refers that the army of the Achaemenid king Xerxes I on its way to the invasion of continental Greece, went from Lydia towards the Caicus and the region of Mysia, through the territory of Atarneus to the city of Carene, and after passing it the troops went up the coast to the north, then went northeast, along the coastal route that contoured the Sinus Adramyttius, until reaching Adramyttium, a city located in the fertile plain of Thebe.

In the 4th century BCE, Thebe minted coins in bronze on which the legends «ΘΗΒ» or «ΘΗΒΑ» appear.

==Mythology==
According to one account, the city of Thebe was founded by the hero Heracles after his sack of Troy during the reign of King Laomedon and named after his birthplace, Thebes in Boeotia. At the time of the Trojan War, Hypoplacian Thebe was in the hands of a people known as the Cilicians, and ruled by King Eetion. Eetion&#x27;s daughter Andromache was given in marriage to Hector, son of King Priam of Troy. The Achaeans, led by Achilles, sacked the city during the latter part of the war, killed King Eetion, his wife and his sons. They also carried off several women, including Chryseis, who became the concubine of Agamemnon. Chryseis&#x27;s father attempts to ransom his daughter, initiating the plot of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;. One of Achilles&#x27; horses, Pedasus, also came from Thebe.

<text>Raymond &quot;Ray&quot; Ozzie (born November 20, 1955) is an American software industry entrepreneur who held the positions of Chief Technical Officer and Chief Software Architect at Microsoft between 2005 and 2010. Before Microsoft, he was best known for his role in creating Lotus Notes.

==Biography==

He grew up in Chicago, Illinois, later moving to Park Ridge, Illinois and graduating from Maine South High School in 1973 where, in 1969, he learned to program on a GE-400 mainframe and an Olivetti-Underwood Programma 101.

He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in computer science in 1979 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he worked on the PLATO system, and began his working career at Data General Corporation where he worked for Jonathan Sachs. After leaving Data General, Ozzie worked at Software Arts for Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston, the creators of VisiCalc, on that product and TK Solver. Shortly thereafter, he was recruited by Sachs and Mitch Kapor to work for Lotus Development to develop what became Lotus Symphony. Ozzie left Lotus Development in 1984 and founded Iris Associates to create the product later sold by Lotus as Lotus Notes, based in part on his experiences using the PLATO Notes group messaging system. Iris Associates was acquired by Lotus in 1994, and Lotus itself was acquired by IBM in 1995.

Ozzie worked there for several years before leaving to form Groove Networks. Groove was acquired by Microsoft in 2005, where Ozzie became one of three Chief Technical Officers. That year, he wrote a seven-page, 5,000-word internal memo, titled The Internet Services Disruption: &quot;It&#x27;s clear that if we fail to do so, our business as we know it is at risk ... We must respond quickly and decisively.&quot;

On June 15, 2006, Ozzie took over the role of Chief Software Architect from Bill Gates.

In October 2008 Ozzie announced Microsoft Azure, the first project to emerge from his advanced development labs focused on new and potentially disruptive approaches to Microsoft&#x27;s business. The project, originally known as &quot;Red Dog&quot;, was led by Dave Cutler and Amitabh Srivastava. In January 2009, another project emerging from these labs, &quot;Live Mesh&quot;, received a Crunchie Award for best technology innovation. In October 2009 he also created FUSE Labs (Future Social Experiences) within this advanced development unit, focusing on innovation in social experiences for mobile and web.

Ozzie officially announced his plans to step down from his role at Microsoft on October 18, 2010 and his final day was December 31, 2010. In 2011 he helped create the non-profit Safecast.

In January 2012 Ozzie started Talko Inc., a company that delivered mobile apps and services for business team communications primarily focused on those roles in which voice is essential. Talko was launched in September 2014. Ozzie has said that the name &quot;Talko&quot; was meant as an homage to Talkomatic, a popular group chat program he experienced while working on the PLATO System in the 1970s. Ray sold the company to Microsoft in December 2015 with the intent to bring Talko&#x27;s novel voice and productivity features to Microsoft&#x27;s Skype.

In 2013, Ozzie joined the board of directors at Hewlett-Packard, and continues to serve as a director of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. He joined the board of Safecast in 2017.

In April 2020, Ray Ozzie raised $11 million for his new venture, Blues Wireless, an IoT company.

==Awards and honors==
Ozzie was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2004 for the conception and development of online collaboration products, including Lotus Notes.

<text>The Union of French Baptist Churches in Canada (French: &quot;L&#x27;Union d&#x27;Églises baptistes francophones du Canada&quot;) is a Baptist Christian denomination with a membership base of French-speaking Canadians. Headquarters is in Fulford, Quebec. The union is one of four regions of Canadian Baptist Ministries and is a member of the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada.

==History==

The union has its origins in a Swiss mission (&quot;Mission Grande Ligne&quot;) of Henriette Feller and Louis Roussy in Grande-Ligne (becoming Saint-Blaise-sur-Richelieu) in Montérégie, in 1836. That same year, they founded a school which would become the Feller College. In 1849, the mission and school became partners of the Canadian Baptist Missionary Society. In 1969, churches established by pastors trained at the Institute officially founded the &quot;Union of French Baptist Churches in Canada&quot;. The union became part of the Canadian Baptist Ministries in 1970.

The Union opened a new Bible college, the Faculté de Théologie évangélique (Evangelical Theology Faculty) in Montreal in 1982.

In 2010, it had 29 member churches. 

According to a census published by the association in 2024, it claimed 32 churches. 

== Beliefs == 
The association has a Baptist confession of faith. The Union is a member of Canadian Baptist Ministries and Evangelical Fellowship of Canada.

<doc id="423819" wikidata="Q1194367" url="?curid=423819" title="Olentzero">
<text>Olentzero (, sometimes Olentzaro or Olantzaro) is a character in Basque Christmas tradition. According to Basque traditions, Olentzero comes to town late at night on 24 December to drop off presents for children. In some places he arrives later, for example in Ochagavía – Otsagabia on the 27th and in Ermua on the 31st.

==The name==
The name &quot;Olentzero&quot; appears in a number of variations: &quot;Onenzaro&quot;, &quot;Onentzaro&quot;, &quot;Olentzaro&quot;, &quot;Ononzaro&quot;, &quot;Orentzago&quot; and others. The earliest records give the name as &quot;Onentzaro&quot; and the name is most likely composed of two elements, &quot;on&quot; &quot;good&quot; plus a genitive plural ending and the suffix &quot;-zaro&quot; which in Basque denotes a season (compare words like &quot;haurtzaro&quot; &quot;childhood&quot;), so &quot;time of the good ones&quot; literally. This suggests a derivation similar to the Spanish &quot;nochebuena&quot;.

Other theories of derivation exist but are not generally accepted:
*from a metathesis of &quot;Noël&quot;, theory of S. Altube
*from a fusion of &quot;O Nazarene&quot; from Christian liturgy, theory of J. Gorostiaga
*from &quot;oles-aro&quot; &quot;alms season&quot;, a phonologically impossible derivation by Julio Caro Baroja

In parts of Navarre this holiday is called &quot;xubilaro&quot; or &quot;subilaro&quot; from &quot;subil&quot;, the word for a Yule log plus the suffix &quot;-zaro&quot;. In parts of Lower Navarre the word &quot;suklaro&quot; is used, a contraction of &quot;sekularo&quot;. &quot;Sekularo&quot; has no clear etymology but is likely to be related to Latin &quot;saecularis&quot;.

==The legend==

There are many variations to the Olentzero traditions and stories connected to him, sometimes varying from village to village. The first written account of Olentzero is from Lope de Isasti in the 17th century: &quot;A la noche de Navidad (llamamos) onenzaro, la sazón de los buenos&quot; (&quot;To Christmas eve (we call) &quot;onenzaro&quot;, the season of the good ones&quot;).

One common version has Olentzero being one of the &quot;Jentillak&quot;, a race of Basque giants living in the Pyrenees. Legend has it that they observed a glowing cloud in the sky one day. They could not could look at this bright cloud except for a very old, nearly blind man. When asked to examine it, he confirmed their fears and told them that it was a sign that Jesus would be born soon. According to some stories, the old man asked the giants to throw him off a cliff to avoid having to live through Christianisation. Having obliged him, the giants tripped on the way down and died themselves except Olentzero.

Other versions have the &quot;jentillak&quot; simply leaving, with only Olentzero remaining behind to embrace Christianity.

Other versions of the &quot;Olentzeroren kondaira&quot;, or &quot;history of Olentzero&quot;, tell that as a new born he was abandoned in the woods and was found by a fairy who gave him the name Olentzero, bestowed gifts of strength and kindness on him and handed him to an older childless couple living alone in the woods. He turned into a strong man and charcoal burner who was also good with his hands, carving wooden toys that he would carry in a big charcoal bag to give to the children of the village. It is said that he died one day saving children from a burning house and that when he died, the fairy who had found him granted him eternal life to continue to bring joy to children and people.

Other variations of the legend, customs and the character include:
*in Areso children would be told to come home early. An adult would then dress up as Olentzero and scare the children still out on the streets with a sickle.
*in Uharte-Arakil he was traditionally suspended from a rope from a window, dressed in a straw mantle, in Lekunberri the effigy was attached to the chimney.
*in Berastegi if the children did not want to go to bed, a sickle would be thrown down the chimney and the children told that Olentzero would come to cut their throats if they did not go to bed.
*in Dima a straw puppet dressed as Olentzero with a sickle would be hung from the church tower after the midnight mass on Christmas Eve and if children had been behaving badly, people would say &quot;Onontzaro begi-gorri txaminira da etorri, austen baldin badegu barua, orrek lepoa kendu guri&quot; &quot;Olentzero with the red eyes has come to the chimney, if we break the fast, he will cut our throats&quot; - referring to the traditional fast in the week before Christmas.
*in Larraun he was called &quot;Ononzaro&quot; and said to have three eyes and usually depicted as a drunkard dressed like a scarecrow. People would ask &quot;Ononzaro begi-gorri, non arrapatu duk arrai ori?&quot; (Olentzero of the red eyes, where did you catch that fish (i.e. inebriation)?) and the answer would be &quot;Bart arratseko amaiketan Zurriolako arroketan&quot; (last night at eleven in the rocks of Zurriola).

==Modern customs and derivation==

Around 1952, in Francoist Spain, a group called Irrintzi Elkartea from Zarautz began to revive the Olentzero traditions. Some of the more gruesome elements were removed to make Olentzero more suitable for young children and to remove elements which were deemed too pagan. From 1956 onwards, the revived Olentzero traditions began to spread outside those parts of Gipuzkoa where the traditions hailed from. During the 1970s he began to take on further new attributes, such as the bringer of gifts in attempts to find an alternative to the Spanish tradition of the Magi and the French Père Noël, summed up in the slogan &quot;Erregeak, españolak&quot; &quot;the Three Wise Men are Spanish&quot;. Today Olentzero is celebrated all over the Basque Country and coexists with the Magi, Père Noël and Father Christmas, some families choosing to celebrate one or more at the same time.

In the modern version, Olentzero is depicted as a lovable character, widely attributed to being overweight, having a huge appetite and thirst. He is depicted as a Basque peasant wearing a Basque beret, a farmer&#x27;s attire with traditional &quot;abarketa&quot; shoes, smoking a pipe, carrying eggs and a bottle of wine. Whether he has a beard or not is not yet an established tradition. Sometimes his face is stained with charcoal, as a sign of his trade as a charcoal-burner. On Christmas Eve, groups of people or children carry effigies of Olentzero around on a chair through the streets, singing Olentzero carols and collecting food or sweets (not unlike the American trick or treat) and the traditions surrounding the holiday of Santa Ageda in the Basque Country where &quot;oles egitea&quot; &quot;asking for alms&quot; is practised. At the end, it is customary in some places to burn the Olentzero, for example in Lesaka.

Variation is still common, both regionally and culturally depending on whether the pagan or Christian aspects of Olentzaro are being emphasised. Near the sea, he is usually takes on more marine attributes, inland he remains thoroughly rural in nature.
Since 1994, he has started to be accompanied by Mari Domingi, a character previously mentioned in a Basque Christmas carol.
Mari Domingi is depicted as a woman in medieval Basque dress.
Her addition brings gender parity to Basque Christmas gift-bringing.

==Olentzero songs==
Similar to European Christmas carols, there are &quot;Olentzero kantak&quot;. Two very common ones are:

===Olentzero===
===Olentzero buru handia===
The title translates as &quot;Olentzero big head&quot;. An &quot;arroba&quot; is an old measure equivalent to 25 lbs. or just over 11 kg.

<text>Little Sonny Warner (October 30, 1930 – April 12, 2007) was an American blues singer.

Haywood S. Warner was born in 1930 in Falls Church, Virginia, United States, and in the early 1950s, Warner sang as a backing vocalist for Van Walls on the Atlantic Records releases &quot;After Midnight&quot; and &quot;Open the Door&quot;. His career received a boost in 1957, when he filled in for Lloyd Price at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem.

Warner&#x27;s biggest hit was saxophonist Big Jay McNeely&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;There&#x27;s Something on Your Mind&quot;, which became a gold record for Checker Records in 1959. He performed with James Brown, Etta James and B.B. King. In his later years, Warner often performed at concerts and festivals in Falls Church.

He died in his hometown in April 2007, at the age of 76.

<text>Alain Krivine (; 10 July 1941 – 12 March 2022) was a French Trotskyist leader.

== Early life ==
Krivine was born in July 1941 in Paris, France, the child of Pierre Léon Georges Krivine, a stomatologist, and Esther Lautman, the sister of French Resistance fighter Albert Lautman. The Krivine family originally came from Ukraine, having fled to France during the antisemitic pogroms of the Russian Empire in the 19th century. 

== Career ==
Krivine was one of the leaders of the May 1968 revolt in Paris, and was the last of the generation radicalised in the 1960s to serve on the political bureau of the LCR. He was the candidate of the LC at the French presidential election of 1969, getting 1.05% of the votes. He released his first book that same year &quot; (The Electoral Farce). In 1974, he participated in the founding of the which became the LCR in that same year. He was the FCR&#x27;s presidential candidate in 1974, coming in ninth place with around 0.37% of votes. He released his second book in 1974 titled &quot; (Questions on the révolution).

He was a member of the Revolutionary Communist League (LCR), which is the French section of the reunified Fourth International. He was a member of the LCR&#x27;s political bureau until March 2006, when he resigned from that committee. He was a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.

He wrote the preface for André Fichaut&#x27;s 2003 autobiography &quot;&quot; (On the bridge. Memories of a Breton Trotskyist worker). Later in 2006, he wrote an autobiography titled &quot;.&quot; (That&#x27;ll go away with age)

== Death ==
Krivine died on 12 March 2022 in Paris, at the age of 80. His funeral was held in the Père Lachaise Cemetery on 21 March 2022. Over 2000 people attended it including many left-wing and far-left figures, including: Jean-Luc Mélenchon former presidential candidate of La France Insoumise (LFI), LFI deputies Adrien Quatennens and Alexis Corbière, former LCR presidential candidate Olivier Besancenot, former NPA presidential candidate Philippe Poutou, journalist Edwy Plenel and the former militant and syndicalist Gérard Filoche.

<doc id="423827" wikidata="Q4479824" url="?curid=423827" title="Westboro, Ottawa">
<text>Westboro (often referred to as Westboro Village) is an area in the west end of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Located along the Ottawa River, Island Park Drive defines Westboro&#x27;s eastern border, while the Ottawa River defines its northern border. Under this definition, the population of the area is 22,725 (2016 Census).

Its community association boundaries are the Transitway to the north, Tweedsmuir Avenue to the east, Carling Avenue to the south and Denbury Avenue to the west. This area excludes the neighbourhood of Westboro Beach, whose community association borders include the area immediately north of Westboro, west of Island Park Drive.

==History==
The neighbourhood got its start in the late nineteenth century, when published flyers proclaimed &quot;Move to Westboro&quot;, and offered prospective residents &quot;views of the Laurentian Mountains&quot;. This slightly creative name for the distant geological formation along the Eardley Escarpment is now better known as the Gatineau Hills, which are visible across the Ottawa River.

Nineteenth-century descriptions of the neighbourhood refer to its location along the Macadam Road to Bells Corners. That road is now known as Richmond Road, and where it slices through Westboro it is the commercial heart of the village-like neighbourhood, once the centre of the old Nepean Township. The old Town Hall on Richmond Road once housed the bell that later became the symbol of the former city of Nepean, now a part of the city of Ottawa, Ontario. The Maplelawn Garden, boasting the second oldest building in Ottawa (built in 1831) and designated a National Historic Site, is located at the western edge of the village.

The other prominent street in Westboro Village is Churchill Avenue, which was known as Main Street, but was renamed in honour of Winston Churchill following World War II. A few blocks to the west, another street was originally named River Road since it bisected the neighbourhood and led down to the beach on the Ottawa River. That street was renamed Roosevelt Avenue for similar reasons post WW II. Westboro&#x27;s integration into Ottawa, which already had streets named River Road and Main Street, also prompted the street renaming.

Westboro existed as a police village from 1903 until 1949, when Ottawa annexed it. An Ottawa streetcar line ran along what is now a narrow grass park along Byron Avenue, bringing Ottawa residents to an area once considered cottage country. Many cottage-like residences still exist today, especially by the Ottawa River north of Scott Street.

The Westboro War Memorial Association erected a memorial cenotaph that same park between Richmond Road and Byron Avenue. Unveiled on June 8, 1985, the cenotaph is dedicated to the memory of the fallen members of Westboro and surrounding area who made the supreme sacrifice in The Great War, The Second World War, and the Korea War.

== Housing ==
Most houses in Westboro were built between 1900 and 1960. 71% of the houses are detached.

==Today==
Westboro is a thriving community with a lively street scene. Several condominium projects are encouraging densification and promising to bring more people to the neighbourhood. The village features murals a local artist painted. The neighbourhood also boasts a concentration of outdoors and sport stores including Mountain Equipment Co-op, Vancouver-based Lululemon Athletica, and Bushtukah, and is close to cycling trails and whitewater rapids in the Ottawa River. The influx of these outdoor and sports stores, along with a number of boutiques, restaurants and coffee shops on Richmond Road are a significant contributor to the gentrification that Westboro underwent in the 2000s.

Two OC Transpo stations serve Westboro: Westboro and Dominion. Routes 11 and 16 provide frequent local bus service along Richmond Road.

Westfest, a free Canadian arts and music festival, was held in Westboro from 2004 to 2015 during the second weekend in June, and featured a variety of local and national performers. It has now been moved to Laroche Park in Ottawa&#x27;s Mechanicsville area. In August, one weekend is dedicated to the Fuse Street Festival, which is located on Richmond Road. Fuse Street Festival celebrates Westboro&#x27;s unique dining experience with added fun of music and festivities.

<doc id="423830" wikidata="Q118911" url="?curid=423830" title="Konica Minolta">
<text>is a Japanese multinational technology company headquartered in Marunouchi, Chiyoda, Tokyo, with offices in 49 countries worldwide. The company manufactures business and industrial imaging products, including copiers, laser printers, multi-functional peripherals (MFPs) and digital print systems for the production printing market. Konica Minolta&#x27;s Managed Print Service (MPS) is called Optimised Print Services. The company also makes optical devices, including lenses and LCD film; medical and graphic imaging products, such as X-ray image processing systems, colour proofing systems, and X-ray film; photometers, 3-D digitizers, and other sensing products; and textile printers. It once had camera and photo operations inherited from Konica and Minolta but they were sold in 2006 to Sony, with Sony&#x27;s Alpha series being the successor SLR division brand.

==History==

===Company history===
Konica Minolta was formed by a merger between Japanese imaging firms Konica and Minolta, announced on 7 January 2003 with the corporate structure completing the re-organization in October 2003. Different group companies, such as the operations in the headquarters and national operating companies, began the process around the same time, however the exact dates vary for each group company.

Konica Minolta uses a &quot;Globe Mark&quot; logo that is similar to but slightly different from that of the former company. It also uses the same corporate slogan as the former Minolta company: &quot;The Essentials of Imaging&quot;.

On 19 January 2006 the company announced that it was quitting the camera business due to high financial losses. SLR camera service operations were handed over to Sony starting on 31 March 2006 and Sony has continued development of cameras that are compatible with Minolta autofocus lenses. Originally, in the negotiations, Konica Minolta wanted cooperation with Sony in camera equipment production rather than a sell-out deal, but Sony vehemently refused, saying that it would either acquire everything or leave everything that had to do with the camera equipment sector of KM. Konica Minolta withdrew from the photography business on 30 September 2006. Three thousand seven hundred employees were laid off.

Konica Minolta closed down its photo imaging division in March 2007. The color film, color paper, photo chemical and digital mini-lab machine divisions have ceased operations. Dai Nippon Printing purchased Konica&#x27;s Odawara factory, with plans to continue to produce paper under Dai Nippon&#x27;s brand. CPAC acquired the Konica chemical factory.

Konica expanded its business presence and currently sells its products in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa.

===Camera history===

====Manual focus 35mm film SLRs====
Konica and Minolta have been competitors in the 35 mm SLR market since the development of the manual-focus (MF) SRT and other models in the mid-1960s. Minolta positioned most of its cameras to compete in the amateur market, though it did produce a very high quality MF SLR in the XD-11. Konica left the SLR market in 1987. Minolta&#x27;s last MF SLR cameras were the X370 and X700. Shanghai Optical Co. (Seagull) purchased tools and production plant from Minolta at different times, making some X300 series for Minolta branding, and continues to release MD mount film SLRs compatible with the old system under the Seagull name.

====Autofocus 35mm film SLRs====
Until the sale of Konica Minolta&#x27;s Photo Imaging unit to Sony in 2006, Konica Minolta produced the former Minolta range of 35 mm autofocus single-lens reflex cameras, variously named &quot;Minolta Maxxum&quot; in North America, &quot;Minolta Dynax&quot; in Europe, and &quot;Minolta Alpha&quot; in Japan and the rest of Asia. This range was introduced in 1985 with the Minolta Maxxum 7000, and culminated with the professional (1997) later made in a titanium body (9Ti) and technically advanced 7 (1999). The final Minolta 35 mm SLR AF cameras were the Maxxum 50 and 70 (Dynax 40 and 60), built in China.

====Digital cameras====

Konica Minolta had a line of digital point and shoot cameras to compete in the digital photography market. Their Dimage line (originally styled as Dimâge, later as DiMAGE) included digital cameras and imaging software as well as film scanners.

They created a new category of &quot;SLR-like&quot; cameras with the introduction of the DiMAGE 7 and DiMAGE 5. These cameras mixed many of the features of a traditional SLR camera with the special abilities of a digital camera. They had a mechanical zoom ring and electronic focus ring on the lens barrel and used an electronic viewfinder (EVF) showing 100 per cent of the lens view. They added many high level features such as a histogram and made the cameras TTL-compatible with Minolta&#x27;s final generation of flashes for film SLRs. The controls were designed to be used by people familiar with SLR cameras, however the manual zoom auto-focus lens was not interchangeable. The model 5 had a 1/1.8-inch sensor with 3.3 megapixels, and the fixed zoom was equal to a 35–250 mm (relative to 24×36mm format). The DiMAGE 7, later 7i, 7Hi and A1 had 5-megapixel sensors for which the same lens provided 28–200 mm equivalent coverage. The later A2 and A200 increased the sensor resolution to 8 megapixels.
The DiMAGE 5 and 7 original models were more sensitive to infrared light than later models, which incorporated more aggressive IR sensor filters, so have become popular for infrared photography.

The DiMAGE A1/A2/A200 integrated a sensor-based, piezoelectrically actuated anti-camera-shake system. Before the closure of the Photo Imaging unit, the DiMAGE lineup included the long-zoom Z line, the E/G lines (the G series finally incorporating former Konica models), the thin/light X line, and the advanced A line.

The DiMAGE G500 was a five-megapixel compact digital camera manufactured by Konica Minolta in 2003. It came in a stainless steel case, 3x zoom lens with a retractable barrel, and dual Secure Digital and MagicGate card slots. The camera has a 1.3-second startup time.

====Digital SLRs====
Minolta made some early forays into digital SLRs with the RD-175 in 1995 and the Minolta Dimâge RD 3000 in 1999 but were the last of the large camera manufacturers to launch a successful digital SLR camera using a current 35 mm AF mount in late 2004. The RD-175 was based on the Maxxum/Dynax 505si 35 mm film SLR and used three different ½-inch CCD image sensors—two for green and one for red and blue—supplied with images by a light splitting mechanism using prisms mounted behind the lens. The RD 3000 used Minolta V-mount APS format lenses and again used multiple CCDs—this time two 1.5 MP ½-inch sensors stitched to give a 2.7 MP output image.

It was not until late 2004 (after the merger with Konica) that they launched the Dynax/Maxxum/α 7D, a digital SLR based on the very successful Dynax/Maxxum 7 35 mm SLR body. The unique feature of this camera is that it features an in-body Anti-Shake system to compensate for camera shake. However, by 2004 Canon and Nikon had a whole range of digital SLR cameras and many serious photographers had already switched, thus leading Konica Minolta to withdraw from the market and transfer assets to Sony. The only two Konica Minolta digital SLRs to reach production before the company&#x27;s withdrawal were the Dynax/Maxxum 7D and the Dynax/Maxxum 5D (which is an entry-level model that shared the 7D&#x27;s sensor and Anti-Shake technology).

In early 2006 Sony announced its Sony α (Alpha) line of digital SLRs, (based on Konica Minolta technology) and stated they were scheduled to launch production in the summer of 2006. The Sony Alpha 100, announced on June 6, 2006, is generally agreed to have been a Konica Minolta design based on the 5D with minimal Sony input. The range of 21 Sony lenses announced at that time also included only revisions of earlier Minolta designs, or models which had been in development, rebadged and with minor cosmetic changes. The Sony Alpha DSLR range utilizing the &#x27;A&#x27;-mount has remained compatible with all Minolta AF system lenses, and most accessories, from 1985 onwards.

In 2000 Minolta announced the introduction of Super Sonic Motor (SSM) focusing to a limited number of new lenses. This dispensed with a mechanical drive between camera and lens, but only SLRs made from 1999 onwards (the Dynax/Maxxum 7 and later) were compatible, the professional Dynax 9 requiring a factory upgrade to operate. Sony announced a program in 2008 to fit more future lenses with SSM and these designs may, therefore, not be compatible with 1985–1999 SLR bodies.

===Business equipment history===

====Multifunctional devices====
For some time after the merger between Konica and Minolta, both product lines continued to be sold, while research and development efforts were underway to create new products.
The first Konica Minolta badged products were almost entirely &quot;Konica&quot; or &quot;Minolta&quot; products however, as they were the next generation products being produced by both companies before the merger. These products included MFPs such as the Konica Minolta bizhub C350 (a &quot;Minolta&quot; design, also badged as the Konica 8022 and Minolta CF2203), and Konica Minolta 7235 (A &quot;Konica&quot; design).

Successive models included greater integration between the two sets of technologies, and current products such as the bizhub C451 (pictured below in this article) contain many technologies from both histories. Some products such as the bizhub 501 are more noticeably an engine design from one company rather the other, however the system itself, including operation, features and RIP technologies are in the &quot;new style&quot; that holds little legacy from either former company. 

As with many MFP manufacturers, some of the market segments are not produced directly by the manufacturer. In Konica Minolta&#x27;s case, many smaller SOHO MFP products (such as the bizhub 130f, wearing Minebea marks in hardware and in software drivers) are produced by third parties. By the same token, many other companies also re-badge Konica Minolta products under OEM agreements.

====Printers====
As the printer operations of the former Konica company were limited to &quot;printer models&quot; of MFP models, or re-badged printers from other manufacturers, while the printer operations of the former Minolta company were strong since the purchase of QMS (completed in 2000 after increasing influence and shareholding by Minolta), printer operations were initially not affected greatly by the Konica Minolta merger. In the 1980s QMS made the KISS laser printer, the most inexpensive then available at $1995.

Due to the increased complexity of both MFP and printer devices, Konica Minolta increased technology sharing between the two lines of products. In many regions, this has led to the integration of the Printer products company into the Business equipment products company.

==Business companies==
Konica Minolta has spun off business units into separate companies.

===Konica Minolta Business Technologies, Inc.===
The Konica Minolta Business Technologies division develops multifunction printers, copiers, computer printers, facsimile machines, microfilm systems and related supplies. The divisional head office is in Tokyo, with regional offices in Worldwide headquarters are also located in: Germany (Konica Minolta Europe), USA (Konica Minolta Business Solutions USA), New Zealand (Konica Minolta Business Solutions New Zealand), Australia (Konica Minolta Australia) and China (Konica Minolta China). These headquarters are responsible for sales and support of the Konica Minolta companies in each country within their region, including distributors and the dealer networks. In an effort to improve profitability in a declining printer market, Konica Minolta Business Solutions begins to acquire enterprise content management (ECM) service and software solution providers.

The division has approximately 19,600 employees.

====Multi-functional peripherals (MFPs)====
Pursuing advanced imaging markets Konica Minolta&#x27;s digital multi-functional peripherals (MFPs), branded the &quot;bizhub&quot; series, are equipped with multiple functions (copying, printing, faxing, scanning), and can integrate into any corporate network environments. They allow users to consolidate the administration of office equipment connected to a network by using a series of network management software programs and even to manage and share both scanned data and computer-generated data.

====Konica Minolta Printing Solutions====
Advanced generation of compact, lightweight and high-performance color laser printers. The market for color laser printers continues to expand, fuelled by the rapid shift of business documents from monochrome to color. Konica Minolta&#x27;s color laser printers—branded the &quot;Magicolor&quot; series and using toner technology inherited from QMS/Qume include what was then the world&#x27;s smallest and lightest color laser printer with 2400 dpi photographic quality, the Magicolor 2430DL of 2005. This printer also offered direct output from digital cameras using PictBridge and EXIFII Print Order Management technology, via USB. The Magicolor series covers from entry level home/office models like the 2430s successors, to large print stations for corporate environments.

As of May 2007 Printing Solutions (Europe) business was merged with Konica Minolta Business Solutions (Europe) as part of radical reforms within the company.

<text>NATS Holdings, formally National Air Traffic Services and commonly referred to as NATS, provides en-route air traffic control services to flights within the UK flight information regions and the Shanwick Oceanic Control Area. It also provides air traffic control services to 14 UK airports.

The company&#x27;s en-route business is regulated and operated under licence from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).

==History==

The organisation was originally set up as the National Air Traffic Control Services (NATCS) in 1962, bringing together responsibility for the UK&#x27;s existing military and civil air traffic control services.

The organisation became National Air Traffic Services (NATS) when the responsibility for sponsoring the civil air traffic service component was transferred to the newly formed Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in 1972. Before this it had no legal existence – all contracts were with the CAA or MoD.

Until its establishment as a separate company, the leadership of NATS (the &quot;Controller&quot;) alternated between civil and military, the latter normally a serving air marshal. The first controller was Sir Laurence Sinclair, exceptionally a retired air vice marshal. NATS staff were drawn from and paid by, the CAA and the MoD.

In 1992 it was recognised by the Government that as a service provider, NATS should be operated at some distance from its regulator, the CAA. Although debated, it was decided that NATS should not be privatised at that time. NATS was re-organised into a limited company on 1 April 1996 and became a wholly owned subsidiary of the CAA. The direct involvement of military officers in the management of NATS ended at this time, although the last military Controller, Air Marshal Sir Thomas Stonor, KCB, had retired in 1991.

In 1998, a public-private partnership was proposed. This was written into the Transport Act 2000 and in 2001 51% of NATS was transferred to the private sector. However, due to the decline in air traffic following the 11 September 2001 attacks an additional investment of £130m was required, £65m coming each from the UK government and BAA, which received 4% of the company in return.

As a public-private partnership the UK government holds 49% and a golden share, with 42% held by the Airline Group, 5% by NATS staff, and 4% by UK airport operator LHR Airports Ltd.

==Structure==

The workforce of NATS includes air traffic controllers (ATCOs), air traffic control engineers (ATCEs), air traffic services assistants (ATSAs) and science technical analytical and research staff (STARs). Administrative and support staff make up the remainder of the 4,200 or so employees of NATS. Martin Rolfe became CEO of NATS in May 2015.

NATS is split into two main service provision companies: &quot;NATS En-Route PLC&quot; (NERL) and &quot;NATS Services Ltd&quot; (NSL).

* NERL is the sole provider of civilian en-route air traffic control over the UK and is regulated by the CAA which, for example, determines the charges NERL can make. NERL is funded by Eurocontrol route charges for the provision of air traffic services.
* NSL competes for contracts to provide air traffic control at airports in the UK and overseas, as well as providing related services including engineering, consultancy, information services, and training.

==Operations==
In 2019 NATS handled 2.54m flights.

===En-route control centres===
There are two control locations in the UK operated by NERL:

* London Area Control Centre and London Terminal Control Centre at Swanwick in Hampshire control both upper level en-route traffic across England and Wales up to the Scottish border and low-level traffic around London and South East England, including aircraft making approaches to the main London airports.
* The Prestwick Centre, Ayrshire, is home to the Scottish Area Control Centre (including, since January 2010, the former Manchester Area Control Centre), which controls traffic over Scotland, Northern Ireland, and up to FL285 over the northern half of England, and the Prestwick Oceanic Area Control Centre which provides a procedural control service for traffic crossing the North Atlantic via the Shanwick Oceanic Control Area.

Various radar stations are operated around the UK, one such being that on Great Dun Fell in Cumbria.

===Airport services===

The airports service line provides air traffic services at 16 UK airports:

* Heathrow Airport
* Southampton Airport
* Gatwick Airport
* Aberdeen Airport
* Birmingham Airport
* London City Airport
* Luton Airport
* London Stansted Airport
* Cardiff Airport
* Bristol Airport
* Farnborough Airport
* Manchester Airport
* Belfast International Airport
* George Best Belfast City Airport
* Glasgow Airport 

NATS has also won contracts to provide air traffic control engineering services at certain airports including:
* London Biggin Hill Airport
* London Oxford Airport
* Highlands and Islands Airports

NATS also provides services to the Ministry of Defence (MoD), via Qinetiq, for air traffic and range air control services at a number of UK ranges, including:
* MOD Aberporth
* MOD Hebrides
* Larkhill Garrison
* MOD West Freugh

NATS also provides services to the MoD&#x27;s Military Aviation Authority.

Aberdeen NSL provides air traffic services on behalf of NERL to offshore helicopters operating primarily from Aberdeen, Shetland (Sumburgh), Humberside Airport, Norwich Airport and North Denes.

===Defence===

NATS helps the military around the world share airspace with civil aviation for commercial, political and environmental reasons. Services NATS provides include:

* Aeronautical data

====Aquila====

Aquila is a joint venture between NATS and Thales responsible for delivering the UK&#x27;s Marshall program to transform terminal air traffic management at military airfields. Marshall seeks to ensure a safe, efficient and sustainable air traffic management (ATM) service for the UK armed forces. It will modernise ATM at over 100 MoD locations, in the UK and overseas, including more than 60 airfields and ranges.

Aquila is tasked to deliver a system-wide modernisation and rationalisation of the current fragmented system, and establish a flexible ATM service which is future-proofed to meet potential changes in the regulatory and technological landscape.

===Former Operations===

====En-route control centres====
The London Air Traffic Control Centre at RAF West Drayton opened in 1966 and provided ATC services until it closed in 2007, with the move to Swanwick.

Scottish air traffic control has been carried out from Atlantic House in Prestwick since 1978. This situation changed with the opening of the Prestwick Centre in 2010, to which all operational services were transferred from the old Atlantic House along with the functions carried out at the Manchester Area Control Centre which subsequently closed.

====Airport services====

NATS, through its airports service line, established an alliance with Spanish partner Ferrovial in 2011, forming FerroNATS, which provides air traffic control (ATC) services at nine airports across Spain: Alicante, Valencia, Ibiza, Sabadell, Sevilla, Jerez, Melilla, Madrid Cuatro Vientos, Vigo and A Coruña airports in Spain. FerroNATS was awarded the contract to provide services at these airports through a competitive tender process run by the Spanish aviation authority, AENA. All nine operational handovers were completed between November 2012 and January 2014. In February 2023 FerroNATS was sold to Portobello Capital and renamed Skyway. 
==Associations and alliances with other organisations ==

NATS is a full member of the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) joint undertaking, and a member of the SESAR Deployment Alliance, a cross-industry partnership made up of four airline groups, operators of 25 airports and 11 air traffic control providers. The SESAR Deployment Alliance was appointed to the role of SESAR Deployment Manager by the European Commission in December 2014 and will help to co-ordinate and synchronise the modernisation of Europe&#x27;s air traffic management system.

NATS is a founding member of two of Europe&#x27;s leading ANSP Alliances – the A6 Alliance and the Borealis Alliance.

The A6 is an alliance of some of the main European Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs). Its aim is to help drive the modernisation of the European ATM network within the SESAR programme for the benefit of customers. The A6 members are full members of the SESAR Joint Undertaking and are part of the SESAR Deployment Alliance, which was recently appointed SESAR Deployment Manager by the European Commission.

The Borealis Alliance is an alliance of Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs). The Alliance includes the ANSPs of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Norway, Sweden and the UK. The Borealis Alliance is currently working on a major programme to deliver free route airspace across the whole of Northern Europe by 2020.

Since the 1940s, the Irish and UK air traffic control service providers have worked effectively together. This was further strengthened in July 2008 when the UK and Ireland launched the first operational Functional Airspace Block, often referred to in the industry as FAB, under the European Commission&#x27;s Single European Sky initiative.

NATS is a full member of the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO), an international association of companies that provide air traffic control services.

NATS is a shareholder in European Satellite Services Provider (ESSP), a company set up to operate the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS).

NATS is primarily known for the air traffic services it provides in the UK but also works internationally providing air traffic and consultancy services in over 30 countries, working with many different organisations in Europe and beyond, including Singapore, the United States and Qatar.

==Notable incidents==

From 15 to 20 April 2010, under internationally agreed guidelines that require a zero tolerance approach to ash, NATS placed a series of restrictions on aircraft operating in UK controlled airspace owing to the potential dangers caused by a volcanic ash cloud from the eruption of Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull, in cooperation with the Met Office, CAA and UK government.

On 12 December 2014, from 15:30 until 16:30, traffic flow throughout the London airspace was restricted due to a computer system failure at NATS. At 15:30 an announcement was made by Eurocontrol that &quot;There has been a failure of the flight data computer server at London ACC [area control centre].&quot; At 16:30 the airspace was reopened, however it remained restricted with some landing flights being turned away. NATS reported that the failure was due to a single faulty line of software source code.

On 28 August 2023 NATS suffered a major technical incident that caused severe delays. It occurred on the busiest day of the year. The incident lasted approximately 3 hours, however this caused knock-on delays. 790 flights departing UK airports and 785 flights arriving into UK airports were cancelled, representing about 27% of all flights. The following day at least 281 flights were cancelled.

<text>The Lavender Pit is a former open pit copper mine near Bisbee in Cochise County, Arizona, United States. It is located near the famous Copper Queen Mine. The Lavender Pit was named in honor of
Harrison M. Lavender (1890–1952), who as Vice-President and General Manager of Phelps Dodge Corporation, conceived and carried out this plan for making the previously unprofitable low-grade copper bearing rock of the area into commercial copper ore.

Phelps Dodge Corporation opened the Lavender Pit in 1950, at the site of the earlier, higher-grade Sacramento Hill mine. Production through 1974 totaled 86 million tons of ore averaging about 0.7% copper, or about 600,000 tons of copper produced, with gold and silver as byproducts. About 256 million tons of waste were stripped, but a portion of this was acid-leached for additional copper. Turquoise was also a by-product of this mining activity. Bisbee turquoise, also known as Bisbee Blue, is amongst the finest turquoise found anywhere in the world. Mining operations in the pit ended in 1974. The undeveloped Cochise deposit, located immediately north of the Lavender pit, contains an estimated 190 million tons of rock containing 0.4% acid-soluble copper, which may be mined in the future.

Because of the competent host rock, this pit has much steeper sides than other open pit copper mines in the southwest area. The pit covers an area of 300 acres (1.2 km2), and is 900 feet (274 m) deep. Large tonnages of dump rock are placed around Bisbee, notably north of the residential district of Warren and other parts of the southeastern Mule Mountains area.

==Geography==
The mine is at , at an altitude of 4941 feet (1506 m) above mean sea level.

<text>Ronald Gordon King-Smith OBE (27 March 1922 – 4 January 2011) was an English writer of children&#x27;s books, primarily using the pen name Dick King-Smith. He is best known for &quot;The Sheep-Pig&quot; (1983). It was adapted as the movie &quot;Babe&quot; (1995) and translations have been published in fifteen languages. He was awarded an Honorary Master of Education degree by the University of the West of England in 1999 and appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours.

==Early life, military service==
King-Smith was born on 27 March 1922 in Bitton, Gloucestershire and grew up in the West Country. His father was Captain Ronald King-Smith DSO MC, who ran several paper mills. King-Smith was educated at Beaudesert Park School and Marlborough College. He was a soldier in World War II, serving with the Grenadier Guards in Italy, and a farmer for 20 years before he became a teacher at Farmborough Primary School and author. King-Smith&#x27;s first book was &quot;The Fox Busters&quot;, published in 1978 while he was living and teaching in Farmborough.

In 1941, at the age of 19, King-Smith enlisted as a recruit in the Grenadier Guards, and was subsequently commissioned into the Grandier Guards in December 1942. As a young platoon commander in September 1943, he took part in the Salerno Landings in Italy. On arrival in Salerno, his platoon fought their way up Italy, along with many others, which took months. On 12 July 1944, King-Smith was seriously injured by a British hand grenade thrown by a German soldier. He was only saved from certain death because he was sheltering behind a tree, which took the brunt of the explosion. He suffered extensive sharp wounds, and later, when he was back in England, a cerebral embolism, either of which could have killed him. He relinquished his commission in June 1946, &quot;on account of disability&quot;, and returned to farming.

==Personal life==
King-Smith met his wife, Myrle, on Christmas Day 1936. They were both 14. They were married at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Bitton, on 6 February 1943. They had three children: Juliet, Giles and Liz. Myrle died in 2000, and King-Smith subsequently married Zona Bedding, a family friend. He presented a feature on animals on TV-AM&#x27;s children&#x27;s programme &quot;Rub-a-Dub-Tub&quot; (1983).

==Death==
King-Smith died on 4 January 2011 at his home near Bath, Somerset at the age of 88. He was survived by his 3 children, 14 grandchildren, 4 great-grandchildren, and 1 great-great-grandchild.

== Awards ==
King-Smith and &quot;The Sheep-Pig&quot; won the 1984 Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize, a once-in-a-lifetime book award judged by a panel of British children writers.

<doc id="423844" wikidata="Q5527417" url="?curid=423844" title="Gatineau Hills">
<text>The Gatineau Hills () are a geological formation in Canada that makes up part of the southern tip of the Canadian Shield, and acts as the northern shoulder of the Ottawa Valley. They are also the foothills of the Laurentian Mountains which stretch east through Quebec, beginning north of Montreal and joining up with others into Vermont and New Hampshire.

==Geology==
The geology of Gatineau Park, which encompasses these foothills, is related to the Eardley Escarpment, which is a fault line that lies along the southern edge of the hills. This escarpment makes the park an attractive location for rock climbers and hikers, offering a beautiful view of the relatively flat fields below, which extend to the Ottawa River. The Eardley Escarpment is part of the northern side of the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben, which is an ancient rift valley.

==History==
The Algonquin people settled in the Ottawa valley more than 4,000 years ago. French explorers arrived in the early seventeenth century. The Gatineau Hills&#x27; pine forests were logged extensively in the early 1800s, with many roads built for mining and farming. The deforestation raised increasing concern from the public. Historical records show interest for the creation of a wilderness park in the Gatineau Hills in 1903; many reports, plans and actions were made over the years to protect the area until it became as it looks today.

==Tourism==
The Gatineau Hills are also a popular skiing destination, serving the neighbouring communities of Ottawa, Ontario and Gatineau, Quebec. Gatineau Park contains over 190 km of cross-country trails, and plays host to the annual &quot;Gatineau Loppet&quot; competition. Downhill skiing is available at locations including Camp Fortune, Mont Cascades, Mont Ste. Marie, Edelweiss, and Vorlage. The hills are small compared to the ski areas in the northeast, such as Mont Tremblant and Mont-Sainte-Anne, or in Vermont, New Hampshire and New York.

The location of the hills are also useful for communications, and Ryan Tower, a prominent communications tower at Camp Fortune, provides a large portion of the area&#x27;s broadcast television and radio signals.

The area is a prime tourist attraction, particularly during the month of October when the foliage is turning colour. Photographs and paintings of the area are a popular tourist item.

The Gatineau Hills are located in the city of Gatineau, and in Les Collines-de-l&#x27;Outaouais Regional County Municipality, Quebec.

<doc id="423849" wikidata="Q849706" url="?curid=423849" title="Airport terminal">
<text>An airport terminal is a building at an airport where passengers transfer between ground transportation and the facilities that allow them to board and disembark from an aircraft.

The buildings that provide access to the airplanes (via gates) are typically called concourses. However, the terms &quot;terminal&quot; and &quot;concourse&quot; are sometimes used interchangeably, depending on the configuration of the airport. Smaller airports have one terminal while larger airports have several terminals and/or concourses. At small airports, a single terminal building typically serves all of the functions of a terminal and a concourse. Larger airports might have either one terminal that is connected to multiple concourses or multiple almost independent unit terminals.

By the end of the 20th century airport terminals became symbols of progress and trade, showcasing the aspirations of nations constructing them. The buildings are also characterized by a very rapid pace of redevelopment, much higher than that for structures supporting other modes of transportation, eroding the boundary between the permanent and temporary construction.

==Unit terminals==
An airport might have multiple separate &quot;unit terminals&quot;, in order, for example to separate the international travel from the domestic one, or provide the separate airlines with the ability to offer their own terminals. The unit terminals might use similar design (Dallas-Fort Worth Airport) or be completely different (Pearson International Airport). Use of multiple terminals typically requires an extensive network of automatic people movers.

== Functions ==
Terminals perform three main functions:
* change of mode of transportation: the flights almost inevitably involve some land travel, so the terminal should facilitate the passengers moving along the prescribed routes and thus contains so called &quot;passenger circulation areas&quot;;
* processing of the passengers and their luggage that includes ticketing / checking-in of passengers, separating the luggage and returning it back to the passengers, security checks of both passengers and luggage. These functions are performed in the &quot;passenger processing spaces&quot;;
* grouping/ungrouping of the passengers. The passengers do not arrive at the terminal pre-sorted in batches for the flights and have to be grouped to board a plane. Upon arrival, a reverse process occurs, so the terminal needs the &quot;passenger holding place&quot;.

===Landside and airside===

Just like entire airports, the terminals are divided into landside and airside zones. Typically passengers and staff must be checked by airport security, and/or customs/border control before being permitted to enter the airside zone. Conversely, passengers arriving from an international flight must pass through border control and customs to access the landside area.

The landside-airside boundary became the defining element of the terminal architecture. The functions that are performed on the landside, like ticketing and check-in, are relatively stable, while the airside is subject to rapid technological and operational changes. Victor Marquez suggests that the boundary is not really an integral part of the airport functions, but a &quot;socio-technical construct&quot; that has gradually shaped the thinking of architects and planners.

== Architectural styles ==
The passenger terminal is the main opportunity within the airport for architects to express themselves and a key element of the airport design. Brian Edwards compares the architectural role of the terminal in the airport to the one of a mall within a small town.

Historically, airports were built in a variety of architectural styles, with the selection depending on the country:
* in the US, Art Deco was used for the Kansas&#x27;s Fairfax Airport (1929, Charles A. Smith, Moderne for Washington Airport (1930, Holden, Scott and Hutchinson), Neocolonial for the first St. Louis airport (1931) and the Floyd Bennett Field (1931); Adobe style for Albuquerque Airport (1936–1939, Ernest Blumenthal), Spanish-pueblo style for the San Francisco Airport (1937, H. G. Chipier), International Modern for Chicago Airport, Moderne/Art Deco combination for the Miami Airport and LaGuardia (Delano and Aldrich);
* South America was following the US pattern, with more Modern in the mix;
* Europe preferred all stripes of Modernism, from Brick Expressionism (Madrid–Barajas Airport, 1929–1931, Luis Gutiérrez Soto) to edgy French Modernism and Czech version of functionalism (Prague Airport, 1933–1937, Adolf Benš) to softer Scandinavian functionalism (Kastrup Airport, 1936–1938, Vilhelm Lauritzen). Few early terminals used Neoclassical style of the Edwardian era, a terminal in the old Basra Airport was built to resemble a palace (1937–1938, Wilson and Mason).

The concrete boxes of terminals built in the 1960s and 1970s generally gave way to glass boxes in the 1990s and 2000s, with the best terminals making a vague stab at incorporating ideas of &quot;light&quot; and &quot;air&quot;&#x27;. However, some, such as Baghdad International Airport and Denver International Airport, are monumental in stature, while others are considered architectural masterpieces, such as Terminal 1 at Charles de Gaulle Airport, near Paris, the main terminal at Washington Dulles in Virginia, or the TWA Flight Center at New York&#x27;s JFK Airport. A few are designed to reflect the culture of a particular area, some examples being the terminal at Albuquerque International Sunport in New Mexico, which is designed in the Pueblo Revival style popularized by architect John Gaw Meem, as well as the terminal at Bahías de Huatulco International Airport in Huatulco, Oaxaca, Mexico, which features some palapas that are interconnected to form the airport terminal.&quot;

==Early history==
The first airfields, built in the early 20th century, did not have passengers and thus did not need the terminals. Large facilities were built, however, to house the fragile and inventive airships of the time protecting them from elements and industrial spies. Still, some of the concept architectural designs resembled the modern terminal buildings: Erich Mendelsohn’s sketch (1914) contained a large building with the attached ancillaries for planes (the central building was intended not for the passengers, but for a dirigible). The predecessors of the modern terminals were the structures erected for the air shows of the Edwardian era (for example, the Reims Air Meet in 1909). These buildings usually were L-shaped, with one wing dedicated to the planes and flight personnel, and the other intended for the spectators, with a grandstand and restaurants in an arrangement similar to the one used for the racetracks. The shows also featured occasional passenger flights. The other template of a terminal was provided by the first airline, the German DELAG that featured sheds for Zeppelins combined with passenger spaces close to the centers of cities, like the railroad stations.

The first European passenger airports of the interwar period in the major transportation nodes (London, Paris, Berlin) were converted military airfields (London Terminal Aerodrome, Croydon Aerodrome, Great West Aerodrome, Le Bourget, Tempelhof) and lacked the spaces for the actual passengers. US, on the other hand, lacked the war infrastructure and had to build the airports from scratch, mostly following the &quot;hangar-depot&quot; building type where, staff, passengers, and airplanes were all accommodated inside a single large building, like the one at the Ford Dearborn Airport (1925–1926).

Dedicated passenger buildings started to appear. In Europe, Le Bourget got a new buildings in classical style arranged in very non-airport-like manner around a central garden in the early 1920s. The &quot;air station&quot; of Königsberg Devau (1922) was probably the first design resembling the modern ones: Hanns Hopp, a German architect, placed a passenger building flanked by hangars into the corner of an airfield. This design influenced the Tempelhof, arguably the seminal design in the history or airports: the original Modernist terminal by Paul and Klaus Englers of 1926-1929 was placed into the center of the field, thus defied the need for expansion, and had to be replaced by the new building in the late 1930s (architect Ernst Sagebiel). Hounslow (now Heathrow airport) was processing the passengers through a reused aircraft hangar, and a new classical terminal was built in Croydon in 1928. In the US, by 1931 the first airport in Chicago (now Midway Airport) had its own Art Deco terminal building.

Sagebiel&#x27;s Tempelhof had an appearance of a major railway terminus and housed, like many other European airports, great restaurants. The design survived for more than 60 years, highly unusual for an airport due to Sagebiel being prescient and oversizing the building beyond the scope of the original needs.

The original Le Bourget design was corrected by in 1936–1937, with the new Modernist single-terminal layout following ideas of not-yet-unfinished Tempelhof (but without covered access to the planes) and Croydon.

New York&#x27;s LaGuardia Airport (Delano and Aldrich, 1939) contained many features common in the modern designs: two-level layout for separation between departing and arriving passengers, &quot;spine&quot; concourse extending to the both sides of the building, &quot;dispatcher booths&quot; as precursors to the airport gates.

== Airbridges ==

Tempelhof faced a contemporary critique for its cantilevered roofs intended to protect the planes and passengers − but wasteful in terms of construction and limiting the future aircraft designs (in addition to the lack of separation between the boarding and deplaning passengers). The movable covered ways (precursors of the modern jet bridges) were experimented with in the 1930s. The Boeing&#x27;s United Airport in Burbank, California featured retractable canopies already in the 1930. The tubes first appeared in the 1936 terminal at the London South Airport. The circular terminal design included six telescopic rectangular in section tubes for passengers, moving over the rails.

== Rail links ==

The terminal at London South (now known as Gatwick Airport) also featured the first direct rail link connection (to the London Victoria Station). The rail ticket was included with the airfare.

== Centralized luggage handling ==
The system for early separation of departing passengers from their luggage (check-in desk) was introduced in the Speke Airport in Liverpool (1937–1938). It remains a key element of design of most passenger terminals ever since.

== After Second World War ==

Some airlines checked in their passengers at downtown terminals, and had their own transportation facilities to the airfield. For example, Air France checked in passengers at the Invalides Air Terminal (Aérogare des Invalides) from 1946 to 1961, when all passengers started checking in at the airport. The Air Terminal continued in service as the boarding point for airline buses until 2016.

Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare International Airport&#x27;s innovative design pioneered concepts such as direct highway access to the airport, concourses, and jetbridges; these designs are now seen at most airports worldwide.

When London Stansted Airport&#x27;s new terminal opened in 1991, it marked a shift in airport terminal design since Norman Foster placed the baggage handling system in the basement in order to create a vast open interior space. Airport architects have followed this model since unobstructed sightlines aid with passenger orientation. In some cases, architects design the terminal&#x27;s ceiling and flooring with cues that suggest the required directional flow. For instance, at Toronto Pearson&#x27;s Terminal 1 Moshe Safdie included skylights for wayfinding purposes.

==Security==

Originally, the airport terminals were secured the same way as the rail stations, with local police guarding against the common crimes, like pickpocketing. The industry-specific crimes were rare, although the first plane hijacking occurred in the 1931 (in Peru). The 1960s brought the waves of terrorism and the tight security based on the ICAO recommendations. By the 1990s both passengers and luggage were routinely screened for weapons and explosive devices. The old floorplans of terminals were frequently inadequate (and structures not strong enough to carry the weight of the new equipment), so extensive redesign was required. Passenger garages integrated into the terminals were moved out to reduce the potential effects of the car bombs. Time spent by passengers at the airports greatly increased, causing the need for additional space.

==Layouts==

Early airport terminals opened directly onto the tarmac: passengers would simply walk to their aircraft, a so-called &quot;open apron&quot; layout. This simple design is still common among smaller airports.

=== Linear ===
For larger airports, like Kansas City International Airport, Munich Airport and Charles de Gaulle Airport, allowing many passenger to walk across tarmac becomes unfeasible, so the terminals switch to the &quot;linear&quot; layout, where the planes are located next to an elongated building and passengers use jet bridges to walk on board. The design places limit on the number of gates, as the walkability requirement dictates the total length of the building (including the &quot;spine&quot; concourses) to be less than mile.

==== Semicircular ====
Some airports use a linear structure bent into a semicircular shape, with aircraft parked on the convex side and cars on the other. This design still requires long walks for connecting passengers, but greatly reduces travel times between check-in and the aircraft.

===Pier===
A pier design uses a small, narrow building with aircraft parked on both sides. One end connects to a ticketing and baggage claim area. Piers offer high aircraft capacity and simplicity of design, but often result in a long distance from the check-in counter to the gate (up to half a mile in the cases of Kansai International Airport or Lisbon Portela Airport&#x27;s Terminal 1). Most large international airports have piers, O&#x27;Hare Airport in Chicago and Hartsfield Airport in Atlanta were able to process 45 million passengers per year using this layout in the 1970s.

==== Remote pier ====
Remote pier layout consist of multiple concourses that are connected by automatic people movers located underground or overhead. Once arrived on the concourse, passengers get on the planes as usual. This layout, after its first appearance at Hartsfield, was used at Stansted Airport in UK and, with an adequate people-moving system, is considered to be very efficient for the airport hubs with high percentage of transfer passengers.

===Satellite terminals===

A satellite terminal is a round- or star-shaped building detached from other airport buildings, so that aircraft can park around its entire circumference. The first airport to use a satellite terminal was London Gatwick Airport. It used an underground pedestrian tunnel to connect the satellite to the main terminal. Passengers are sometimes ferried to the satellite terminals by people movers, trains, or overhead bridges. The layout has the potential to cut the walking distances and was successfully applied in the Orlando International Airport and Tampa International Airport. However, the excessive area of airport apron required and difficult remodeling for new aircraft designs had reduced its popularity. Los Angeles International Airport, in particular, switched from satellite terminals to pier layout in the 1980s.

=== Transporter terminals ===

The idea of a large airport using specially-built vehicles to connect passengers to the planes was driven by the desire to reduce time spent by the planes getting to and from the terminal, and dates to 1960s. The bodies of the so-called mobile lounges can be raised to match the height of the terminal and airplane exit doors (much earlier designs used regular apron buses, for example, in the Milan&#x27;s Linate Airport, but the passengers in this case had to climb up and down the airstairs). While used in the Washington Dulles International Airport and King Abdulaziz International Airport, the arrangement is prone to slowing down the embarkation and disembarkation as well as accidental damage to the planes.

===Other===
A particularly unusual design was employed at Berlin Tegel Airport&#x27;s Terminal A. Consisting of an hexagonal-shaped ring around a courtyard, five of the outer walls were airside and fitted with jet bridges, while the sixth (forming the entrance), along with the inner courtyard, was landside. Although superficially resembling a satellite design insofar as aircraft could park around most of the structure, it was in fact a self-contained terminal which unlike a satellite did not depend on remote buildings for facilities such as check-in, security controls, arrivals etc.

Especially unique were its exceptionally short walking distances and lack of any central area for security, passport control, arrivals or transfer. Instead, individual check-in counters are located immediately in front of the gate of the flight they serve. Checked-in passengers then entered airside via a short passage situated immediately to the side of the check-in desk, passed (for non-Schengen flights) a single passport control booth (with officers sat in the same area as check-in staff), followed by a single security lane which terminated at the gate&#x27;s waiting area behind. Pairs of gates shared the same seating area, with small kiosks for duty-free and refreshments making up the only airside commercial offerings. Thus, other than the adjacent gate, passengers could not move around the terminal airside and there was no central waiting lounge and retail area for departures. Individual rooms for arrivals, likewise serving a pair of gates, each contained a single baggage carousel and were alternately situated in between each pair of departure gates on the same level, such that the entrance/exit of each jet bridge lied at the boundary of the two areas. Two or three passport control booths were located close to the end of the jet bridge for arriving passengers (causing passengers to queue into the bridge and plane itself) and passengers left the arrivals area unsegregated from departing passengers into the same landside ring-concourse, emerging next to the check-in desks. This allowed both arriving and departing passengers immediate access to the courtyard on the same level, where short-stay parking and taxi-pickup were located. Vehicles could enter and exit via a road underpass underneath the terminal building entrance.

For flights using jet-bridges and passengers arriving or leaving by private transport, this resulted in extremely short walking distances of just a few tens of metres between vehicles and the plane, with only a slightly longer walk for public transport connections. A downside of this design is a lack of any provision for transfer flights, with passengers only able to transit landside.

Hybrid layouts also exist. San Francisco International Airport and Melbourne Airport use a hybrid pier-semicircular layout and a pier layout for the rest.

== Levels ==
Chris Blow lists the following standard options of using multiple levels in the airport terminals:
* &quot;Side-by-side arrivals and departures on a single level&quot; is the simplest option for small airports that do not use the jet bridges;
* &quot;Side-by-side arrivals and departures on two levels&quot; uses a street-level car traffic at the landside interface, with elevators and lifts bringing the passengers to and from the upper (boarding) level with jet bridges;
* &quot;Vertical stacking of arrivals and departures&quot; is adopted by the large airports. The departure spaces are located on the upper level, while the arrivals along with all baggage processing are handled at the lower level. This approach typically uses an elevated car approach for departures, so the departing passengers are dropped off at the level of (or above) the boarding gates. Deplaning passengers are guided down to the baggage reclaim area;
* &quot;Vertical segregation&quot; is used for very high passenger traffic. In this scheme, there is no mixing of departing and arriving passengers at all. While segregation can be horizontal, typical arrangement places the departure circulation onto the upper level, while the arriving passenger flow happens on the lower level (at the end of their route, the departing passengers are guided down to the airplanes).

==Common-use facility==
A common-use facility or terminal design disallows airlines to have its own proprietary check-in counters, gates and IT systems. Rather, check-in counters and gates can be flexibly reassigned as needed. This is used at Boston Logan International Airport&#x27;s Terminal E.

==Records==
This table below lists the top airport terminals throughout the world with the largest amount of floor area, with usable floor space across multiple stories of at least .
==Ground transportation==
Many small and mid-size airports have a single, two, or three-lane one-way loop road which is used by local private vehicles and buses to drop off and pick up passengers.

A large hub airport often has two grade-separated one-way loop roads, one for departures and one for arrivals. It may have a direct rail connection by regional rail, light rail, or subway to the downtown or central business district of the closest major city. The largest airports may have direct connections to the closest freeway. The Hong Kong International Airport has ferry piers on the airside for ferry connections to and from mainland China and Macau without passing through Hong Kong immigration controls.

<text>The Bell–LaPadula model (BLP) is a state-machine model used for enforcing access control in government and military applications. It was developed by David Elliott Bell, and Leonard J. LaPadula, subsequent to strong guidance from Roger R. Schell, to formalize the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) multilevel security (MLS) policy. The model is a formal state transition model of computer security policy that describes a set of access control rules which use security labels on objects and clearances for subjects. Security labels range from the most sensitive (e.g., &quot;Top Secret&quot;), down to the least sensitive (e.g., &quot;Unclassified&quot; or &quot;Public&quot;).

== Features ==
The Bell–LaPadula model focuses on data confidentiality and controlled access to classified information, in contrast to the Biba Integrity Model which describes rules for the protection of data integrity. In this formal model, the entities in an information system are divided into subjects and objects. The notion of a &quot;secure state&quot; is defined, and it is proven that each state transition preserves security by moving from secure state to secure state, thereby inductively proving that the system satisfies the security objectives of the model. The Bell–LaPadula model is built on the concept of a state machine with a set of allowable states in a computer system. The transition from one state to another state is defined by transition functions. A system state is defined to be &quot;secure&quot; if the only permitted access modes of subjects to objects are in accordance with a security policy. To determine whether a specific access mode is allowed, the clearance of a subject is compared to the classification of the object (more precisely, to the combination of classification and set of compartments, making up the &quot;security level&quot;) to determine if the subject is authorized for the specific access mode. The clearance/classification scheme is expressed in terms of a partial order. The model defines one discretionary access control (DAC) rule and two mandatory access control (MAC) rules with three security properties:

# The Simple Security Property states that a subject at a given security level may not read an object at a higher security level.
# The * (Star) Security Property states that a subject at a given security level may not write to any object at a lower security level.
# The Discretionary Security Property uses an access matrix to specify the discretionary access control.

The transfer of information from a high-sensitivity document to a lower-sensitivity document may happen in the Bell–LaPadula model via the concept of trusted subjects. Trusted Subjects are not restricted by the Star-property. Trusted Subjects must be shown to be trustworthy with regard to the security policy. 

The Bell–LaPadula security model is directed toward access control and is characterized by the phrase &quot;write up, read down&quot; (WURD). Compare the Biba model, the Clark–Wilson model, and the Chinese Wall model.

With Bell–LaPadula, users can create content only at or above their own security level (i.e. secret researchers can create secret or top-secret files but may not create public files; no write-down). Conversely, users can view content only at or below their own security level (i.e. secret researchers can view public or secret files, but may not view top-secret files; no read-up).

The Bell–LaPadula model explicitly defined its scope. It did not treat the following extensively:
* Covert channels. Passing information via pre-arranged actions was described briefly.
* Networks of systems. Later modeling work did address this topic.
* Policies outside multilevel security. Work in the early 1990s showed that MLS is one version of boolean policies, as are all other published policies.

=== Strong Star Property ===
The Strong Star Property is an alternative to the *-Property, in which subjects may write to objects with only a matching security level. Thus, the write-up operation permitted in the usual *-Property is not present, only a write-to-same operation. The Strong Star Property is usually discussed in the context of multilevel database management systems and is motivated by integrity concerns. This &quot;Strong Star Property&quot; was anticipated in the Biba model where it was shown that strong integrity in combination with the Bell–LaPadula model resulted in reading and writing at a single level.

===Tranquility principle===
The tranquility principle of the Bell–LaPadula model states that the classification of a subject or object does not change while it is being referenced. There are two forms to the tranquility principle: the &quot;principle of strong tranquility&quot; states that security levels do not change during the normal operation of the system. The &quot;principle of weak tranquility&quot; states that security levels may never change in such a way as to violate a defined security policy. Weak tranquility is desirable as it allows systems to observe the principle of least privilege. That is, processes start with a low clearance level regardless of their owners clearance, and progressively accumulate higher clearance levels as actions require it.

==Limitations==
* Only addresses confidentiality, control of writing (one form of integrity), *-property and discretionary access control
* Covert channels are mentioned but are not addressed comprehensively
* The tranquility principle limits its applicability to systems where security levels do not change dynamically. It allows controlled copying from high to low via trusted subjects. [Ed. Not many systems using BLP include dynamic changes to object security levels.]

<text>Alexander Cumming FRSE (sometimes referred to as Alexander Cummings; 1733 – 8 March 1814) was a Scottish watchmaker and instrument inventor, who was the first to patent a design of the flush toilet in 1775, which had been pioneered by Sir John Harington, but without solving the problem of foul smells. As well as improving the flush mechanism, Cummings included an S-trap (or bend) to retain water permanently within the waste pipe, thus preventing sewer gases from entering buildings. Most modern flush toilets still include a similar trap.

==Early life==

Cumming was a mathematician and mechanic as well as a watchmaker. Little is known of his early life. He was born in Edinburgh in 1733, the son of James Cumming of Duthil. He is recorded as having been apprenticed to an Edinburgh watchmaker.

==Career==
In the 1750s he was employed by Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll, at Inverary as an organ builder as well as a clockmaker. After his move to England he continued to work in both fields. The Earl of Bute and his family commissioned a series of elaborate barrel organs with which Cumming was involved.
By 1763 he had premises in Bond Street, London, and &quot;had acquired a sufficient reputation to be appointed a member of the commission set up in that year to adjudicate on John Harrison&#x27;s ‘timekeeper for discovering the longitude at sea’&quot;. He made a barometrical clock for King George III, who paid him an annual retainer for its maintenance. Other barometrical clocks created by him are at the Science Museum in London, and on the Isle of Bute.

He wrote books about watch and clock work, about the effect on roads of carriage wheels with rims of various shapes, and on the influence of gravity.

In 1765 he invented a clock for George III which also acted as a barometer, recording air pressure against time. This is notable as the first accurate recording barograph. In 1766 he made a similar model for his personal use, which on his death was purchased by Luke Howard who used it for his observations within the book &quot;The Climate of London&quot;.

In 1770 he is credited with the invention of the microtome, a machine for making extremely thin slices as used in slide-preparation, in conjunction with John Hill.
In 1775 he made major advances on the design of the flushing toilet. His improved valve closet incorporated a sliding valve to keep water in the pan and an S-bend trap in the waste pipe, preventing foul smells from re-entering the house and generally giving a &quot;cleaner&quot; solution. He also linked the water inlet valve to the flush mechanism to allow the pan to be emptied and refilled by pulling a single handle.

With his brother he was involved in the development of the Pentonville district of London, where there is a Cumming Street running north from Pentonville Road. He had a house in the district and an organ shop.

In 1783 he was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and was made a Fellow.

In 1788 Cumming is recorded as a watch and clock-maker on Bond Street in London, responsible for the design and manufacture of a church organ for the Church of the Holy Trinity in Christchurch, Cambridgeshire, having earlier created a &quot;self-acting mechanism&quot; already used for an organ for the Earl of Bute in 1787. In 1814 his final patent appears to be for &quot;antisymmetrical bellows&quot; for organ-use.

==Death==
He died on 8 March 1814, in Pentonville, England. He was buried in the graveyard of St James&#x27; Chapel, Pentonville (since demolished), in what is now Joseph Grimaldi Park, where the famous clown was also buried. The park adjoins Cumming Street.

==Honours==
He became a magistrate in 1779. In 1781 he was made an honorary freeman of the Clockmakers&#x27; Company.

As a result of his making instruments for Capt. Phipps&#x27;s voyage in the polar regions, the island of Cummingøya in Svalbard was named after him.

<text>The Emerald City (sometimes called the City of Emeralds) is the capital city of the fictional Land of Oz in L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;Oz&quot; books, first described in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900).

==Fictional description==
Located in the center of the Land of Oz, the Emerald City is the end of the famous yellow brick road, which begins in Munchkin Country. In the center of the Emerald City is the Royal Palace of Oz. The Oz books generally describe the city as being built of green glass, emeralds, and other jewels.

In the earlier books, it was described as completely green. However, in later works, green was merely the predominant color while buildings were also decorated with gold, and people added other colors to their costumes.

=== In &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900) ===
In the first book, &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900), the walls are green, but the city itself is not. However, when they enter, everyone in the Emerald City is made to wear green-tinted spectacles. This is explained as an effort to protect their eyes from the &quot;brightness and glory&quot; of the city, but in effect makes everything appear green when it is, in fact, &quot;no more green than any other city&quot;. This is yet another &quot;humbug&quot; created by the Wizard.

One scene of the Emerald City is of particular note in the development of Oz: Dorothy sees rows of shops that sell green articles of every variety and a vendor who sells green lemonade that children buy with green pennies. This contrasts with the later description of Oz, in which money does not feature. Interpreters have argued that the Wizard may have introduced money into the city, but this is not in the text itself.

In this book, the Wizard also describes the city as having been built for the Wizard within a few years after he arrived. It was he who decreed that everyone in the Emerald City must wear green eyeglasses, since the first thing he noticed about Oz after he landed in his hot air balloon was how green and pleasant the land was.

=== In &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; (1904) ===
In &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; (1904), the characters are required to wear the glasses at first, but, contrast to the preceding &quot;Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900), halfway through the book, no more eyeglasses appear and no more mention is made of the brilliance, but the city is still described as green. This is continued throughout the series.

Although at one point the character Tip describes the city as being built by the Wizard, the Scarecrow later explains that the Wizard had usurped the crown of Pastoria, the former king of the city, and from the Wizard the crown had passed to him. The book quickly concerns itself with finding the rightful heir to the crown of the city. Princess Ozma remained the king&#x27;s heir, though both she and the original king were transformed to the ruler of all Oz.

=== Later works ===
The story reverted to the Wizard&#x27;s having built the city in &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot; (1908), with the four witches having usurped the king&#x27;s power before the Wizard&#x27;s arrival.

The only allusions to the original conception of Emerald City among the Oz sequels appeared in &quot;The Road to Oz&quot; (1909), where the Little Guardian of the Gates wears green spectacles—though he is the only character to do so.

&quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot; (1910), the sixth book in the Oz series, describes the city as having exactly 9,654 buildings and 57,318 citizens.

==Inspiration==
Baum may have been partly inspired in his creation of the Emerald City by the World Columbian Exposition of 1893, nicknamed the &quot;White City,&quot; which he visited frequently, having moved to Chicago in anticipation of the event. W. W. Denslow, who illustrated the original Oz book, also incorporated elements that may have been inspired by the White City. Denslow was familiar with the exposition as he had been hired to sketch and document it for the &quot;Chicago Times.&quot; Likewise, the quick building of the real-life White City, in less than a year, may have contributed to the quick construction of the Emerald City in the first book.

Others believe Baum may have based his description of the city on the Hotel del Coronado, where he supposedly did much of his writing.

==Interpretations==
=== Capitalist America ===
Scholars who interpret &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; as a political allegory see the Emerald City as a metaphor for Washington, D.C., and unsecured &quot;greenback&quot; paper money. In this reading of the book, the city&#x27;s illusory splendor and value are compared with the value of fiat money, which also has value only because of a shared illusion or convention. Here, Dorothy gains entry to the Emerald City (Washington, D.C.) wearing the witch&#x27;s silver slippers (the silver standard) and taking the Yellow Brick Road (the gold standard). There, she met the Wizard (President William McKinley), whose power was eventually revealed to be an illusion.

=== Post-Industrial America ===
There are also scholars who interpret the Emerald City as a benevolent vision of America with its new priorities and values that emerged with the onset of the industrial order. Some claim, for instance, that it is 1890s Chicago, which rose on a plain, subsuming unto itself much of the Midwestern creative aspiration so that it becomes the Garden of the West that has long struggled in its prairies. This interpretation focused on the affirmative descriptions of the city, which reveal the benefits and rewards of the new culture, particularly urban abundance and the economy of consumption.

=== Other ===
More recently it has been speculated that the name “Emerald City” may be referring to the city of Seattle, Washington. This is incorrect as the American city gained its “Emerald City” nickname in 1982, over 80 years after the publication of Baum&#x27;s first book.

==Known locations==

* Notta Bit More&#x27;s Tent – A tent outside the Royal Palace of Oz where Notta Bit More resides.
* Prison – This is the only prison in the Land of Oz, and it is run by Tollydiggle. The prison is rarely occupied due to lack of crime. Accordingly, Ojo is the only notable prisoner here.
* Royal Palace of Oz – The Royal Palace of Oz is at the center of the Emerald City. This is where the rulers of the Land of Oz reside. It contains a throne room, the royal gardens, and the royal suites for the guests to the Royal Palace.

==Adaptations and allusions==
===In city branding===
==== United States of America ====
The City of Seattle has used &quot;The Emerald City&quot; as its official nickname since 1982. There is also a drink known as &quot;Emerald City&quot; that is associated with the city of Seattle.

Eugene, Oregon is also referred to as the Emerald City, and the region has been known as the &quot;Emerald Empire&quot; as early as 1928.

Greenville, North Carolina is called the Emerald City by locals and tourists alike. The city has an art loop in the uptown district that is called the emerald loop, and on New Years Eve, the city drops an Emerald in the Town Common Park.

Peter Kaplan, a media icon and the former editor of the &quot;New York Observer&quot;, a newspaper that chronicled the city&#x27;s political, financial and cultural elites, frequently referred to New York as the &quot;Emerald City.&quot;

==== Sydney, Australia ====
In 1987, David Williamson—whose brother-in-law scripted the musical film &quot;Oz&quot; (1976)—wrote the play &quot;Emerald City&quot; in which the character Elaine Ross describes Sydney metaphorically as &quot;the Emerald City of Oz.&quot; Sydney is where people go expecting their dreams to be fulfilled only to end up with superficial substitutes and broken dreams.

In 2006, the annual Sydney New Year&#x27;s Eve was entitled &quot;A Diamond Night in Emerald City&quot;, where the &quot;Diamond Night&quot; alluded to the 75th anniversary of the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Subsequently, &quot;Emerald City&quot; has occasionally been used as an unofficial nickname for the City of Sydney.

The head office of the Sydney-based merchant banking and private equity firm Emerald Partners is located on top of the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia building on the Sydney Harbour foreshore, at Circular Quay. The firm was named after Baum&#x27;s book and the David Williamson play.

Fittingly, the word &quot;Oz&quot; can refer to &quot;Australia&quot; in colloquial Australian speech.

A long-running gossip column in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, the city&#x27;s flagship newspaper, is named &quot;Emerald City.&quot;

==== Asia ====
Muntinlupa is nicknamed as the &quot;Emerald City of the Philippines&quot; by the Department of Tourism.

===In cinema &amp; live production===

* The city appears in the film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939), directed by Victor Fleming.
*The 1976 Australian musical &quot;Oz&quot; is a reimagining of Baum&#x27;s original story, set in 1970s Australia. 
* The city appears in &quot;Return to Oz,&quot; having been destroyed by the Nome King with all of its inhabitants turned to stone. When Dorothy enters, she finds the city inhabited by Wheelers and ruled over by Mombi. Upon retrieving the ruby slippers from the Nome King, Dorothy uses their power to restore the Emerald City to its former glory.
*The 1987 Australian play &quot;Emerald City&quot; satirizes the entertainment industry and uses the Emerald City as a metaphor for Sydney, Australia.
* The 2003 stage musical &quot;Wicked&quot;, written by Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman, depicts the city in the song &#x27;One Short Day&#x27;, with Glinda and Elphaba visiting the sights of the city on their way to meet the Wizard. Glinda is seen wearing the green spectacles, as per tradition of the city in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;.
* The city appears in the &#x27;One Short Day&#x27; sequence of the film &quot;Wicked&quot; (2024), based on the musical of the same name directed by Jon M. Chu. The sequence includes a musical within the scene named &quot;Wiz-O-Mania&quot;, advertised as the &quot;absolutely factual story of the wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;.

=== In television ===

* The city appears in &quot;the&quot; &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; TV series. After the Wicked Witch of the West is resurrected by her loyal Flying Monkeys, she casts a spell on the Emerald City that tarnishes it.
* The HBO prison series &quot;Oz&quot; takes place mostly in the experimental unit Emerald City (colloquially EM City) of the fictional Oswald State Penitentiary, somewhere in New York.
* The city can be seen on the hit ABC TV show &quot;Once Upon A Time&quot;.
* Emerald City is alluded to through &quot;Central City,&quot; one of the chief settings in the Sci Fi television miniseries &quot;Tin Man&quot; (2007). The show is a re-imagining of Baum&#x27;s world that alludes to many of the locales of Oz. Central City is a completely computer-generated set, one of the largest for a television series of its time, according to the production designer, Michael Joy. Its scenic design features heavy elements of steampunk and pays visual homage to &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), according to co-creator Craig van Sickle. Likewise, the &quot;Outer Zone&quot; (O.Z.) is described as a bleak rendition of the beautiful world of Oz.
* The 2017 NBC TV series &quot;Emerald City&quot;.
* The Emerald City appears in &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz&quot;

===In literature===
In Gregory Maguire&#x27;s revisionist Oz novels, &quot;&quot; (1995) and &quot;Son of a Witch&quot; (2005), the Emerald City is a much darker place than in Baum&#x27;s novels. It does have splendid palaces and gardens, but sections are also beset by crime and poverty. &quot;Son of a Witch&quot; introduces Southstairs, an extensive political prison located in the caves below the Emerald City. The green glasses worn by the citizens are often used as a way to stop them from seeing what is going on around them.

===In video games===
The video game &quot;Emerald City Confidential&quot; (2009) portrays the Emerald City as a film noir place with private detectives, widespread corruption, mob bosses, smugglers, and crooked lawyers. Set 40 years after the events of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, its described as &quot;Oz, seen through the eyes of Raymond Chandler&quot;.

===Other allusions===
The Green Zone in Baghdad is sometimes ironically and cynically referred to as the &quot;Emerald City&quot;.

<doc id="423882" wikidata="Q231942" url="?curid=423882" title="Natalie Cole">
<text>Natalie Maria Cole (February 6, 1950 – December 31, 2015) was an American singer, songwriter, and actress. She was the daughter of singer and jazz pianist Nat King Cole. She rose to prominence in the mid-1970s, with the release of her debut album &quot;Inseparable&quot; (1975), along with the song &quot;This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)&quot;, and the album&#x27;s title track. Its success led to her receiving the Grammy Award for Best New Artist at the 18th Annual Grammy Awards, for which she became the first African-American recipient as well as the first R&amp;B act to win the award. The singles &quot;Sophisticated Lady&quot; (1976), &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Love on My Mind&quot;, and &quot;Our Love&quot; (1977) followed.

After releasing several albums, she departed from her R&amp;B sound and returned as a pop singer on the 1987 album &quot;Everlasting&quot;, along with her cover of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot;. In the 1990s, she sang traditional pop by her father, resulting in her biggest success, &quot;Unforgettable... with Love&quot;, which was certified 7× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). &quot;Unforgettable... with Love&quot; won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, for which Cole became the first African-American woman to win the award.

Throughout her lifetime, Cole received nine Grammy Awards, was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award, and sold over 30 million records worldwide. She was awarded the Howie Richmond Hitmaker Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1999, and has been posthumously inducted into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame (2021), and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life==
Natalie Cole was born at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles, California, to American singer and jazz pianist Nat King Cole and former Duke Ellington Orchestra singer Maria Hawkins Ellington and raised in the affluent Hancock Park district of Los Angeles. Regarding her childhood, Cole referred to her family as &quot;the black Kennedys&quot; and was exposed to many great singers of jazz, soul and blues. Cole sang on her father&#x27;s 1960 Christmas album &quot;The Magic of Christmas&quot; and later started performing at age 11.

Cole grew up with an older adopted sister, Carole &quot;Cookie&quot; Cole (1944–2009), her mother Maria&#x27;s younger sister&#x27;s daughter, adopted brother Nat &quot;Kelly&quot; Cole (1959–1995), and younger twin sisters Timolin and Casey (born 1961). Through her mother, Cole was a grandniece of educator Charlotte Hawkins Brown. Her paternal uncle Freddy Cole was a singer and pianist with numerous albums and awards.

Cole enrolled in Northfield School for Girls, an elite New England preparatory school, since 1971 known as Northfield Mount Hermon School after merging with another school, before her father died of lung cancer in February 1965. Soon afterwards she began having a difficult relationship with her mother. Cole attended The Buckley School, a private school in Sherman Oaks, California, and then enrolled in the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She transferred briefly to University of Southern California, where she pledged the Upsilon chapter of Delta Sigma Theta sorority. She later transferred back to the University of Massachusetts, where she majored in Child Psychology and minored in German, graduating in 1972.

==Music career==
===Early career===
Cole grew up listening to a variety of music that included Aretha Franklin and Janis Joplin. After graduation in 1972 she began singing at small clubs with her band, Black Magic. Clubs initially welcomed her because she was Nat King Cole&#x27;s daughter, only to be disappointed when she began singing cover versions of R&amp;B and rock songs.

With the assistance of Chuck Jackson and Marvin Yancy, a songwriting and producing duo, she recorded some songs in a studio in Chicago that was owned by Curtis Mayfield. Her demo tapes led to a contract with Capitol, resulting in the release of Cole&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Inseparable&quot;, which included songs that reminded listeners of Aretha Franklin. Franklin later contended that songs such as &quot;This Will Be&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Say No&quot;, and others were offered to her while she was recording the album &quot;You&quot; but she had turned them down. Released in 1975, the album became an instant success thanks to &quot;This Will Be&quot;, which became a top ten hit and won her a Grammy Award for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance.

A second single,
&quot;Inseparable&quot;, also became a hit. Both songs reached number-one on the R&amp;B chart. Cole won Best New Artist at the Grammy Awards for her accomplishments, making her the first African-American artist to attain that feat. The media&#x27;s billing of Cole as the &quot;new Aretha Franklin&quot; started a rivalry between the two singers. The feud boiled over at the 19th Annual Grammy Awards in 1977 when Cole beat Franklin in the Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance category, a category which Franklin had won in the first eight years of the category. Contrary to popular belief, Franklin wasn&#x27;t nominated for a Grammy for the 1976 ceremony, but Cole and Franklin were nominated in the following year where Cole&#x27;s 1976 hit &quot;Sophisticated Lady (She&#x27;s a Different Lady)&quot; beat Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Something He Can Feel&quot; for that Grammy.

===Stardom===

Becoming an instant star, Cole responded to critics who predicted a sophomore slump with &quot;Natalie&quot;, released in 1976. The album, like &quot;Inseparable&quot;, became a gold success thanks to the funk-influenced cut &quot;Sophisticated Lady&quot; and the jazz-influenced &quot;Mr. Melody&quot;.

Cole released her first platinum record with her third release, &quot;Unpredictable&quot;, mainly thanks to the number-one R&amp;B hit &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Love on My Mind&quot;. Originally an album track, the album&#x27;s closer, &quot;I&#x27;m Catching Hell&quot;, nonetheless became a popular Cole song during live concert shows. Later in 1977, Cole issued her fourth release and second platinum album, &quot;Thankful&quot;, which included another signature Cole hit, &quot;Our Love&quot;. Cole was the first female artist to have two platinum albums in one year. To capitalize on her fame, Cole starred on her own TV special, which attracted such celebrities as Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, and appeared on the TV special, &quot;Sinatra and Friends&quot;. In 1978, Cole released her first live album, &quot;Natalie Live!&quot;

In early 1979, the singer was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. That same year, she released two more albums, &quot;I Love You So&quot; and the Peabo Bryson duet album, &quot;We&#x27;re the Best of Friends&quot;. Both albums reached gold status in the U.S., reflecting her continuing popularity.

=== Detour and resurgence ===
Following the release of her eighth album, 1980&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;, Cole&#x27;s career began to take a detour. While Cole scored an adult contemporary hit with the soft rock ballad &quot;Someone That I Used to Love&quot; off the album, the album itself failed to go gold. In 1981, Cole&#x27;s personal problems, including battles with drug addiction, began to attract public notice, and her career suffered as a result. In 1983, following the release of her album &quot;I&#x27;m Ready&quot;, released on Epic, Cole entered a rehab facility in Connecticut and stayed there for six months.

Following her release, she signed with the Atco imprint Modern Records and released &quot;Dangerous&quot;, which started a slow resurgence for Cole in terms of record sales and chart success. In 1987, she changed to EMI-Manhattan Records and released the album &quot;Everlasting&quot;, which returned her to the top of the charts thanks to singles such as &quot;Jump Start (My Heart)&quot;, the top ten ballad, &quot;I Live for Your Love&quot;, and her dance-pop cover of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot;. That success helped &quot;Everlasting&quot; reach one million in sales and become Cole&#x27;s first platinum album in ten years.

In 1989, she released her follow-up to &quot;Everlasting&quot;, &quot;Good to Be Back&quot;, which produced the number seven hit &quot;Miss You Like Crazy&quot;, which became her biggest hit in the United Kingdom by reaching number two on the UK Singles Chart. While the album failed to reach Gold certification in the US, it achieved international success by becoming her only top ten album in the UK, and later being certified Gold there.

Cole released her bestselling album with 1991&#x27;s &quot;Unforgettable... with Love&quot; on Elektra Records, which saw Cole singing songs her famous father recorded, nearly 20 years after she initially had refused to cover her father&#x27;s songs during live concerts. Cole produced vocal arrangements for the songs, with piano accompaniment by her uncle Ike Cole. Cole&#x27;s label released an interactive duet between Cole and her father on the title song, &quot;Unforgettable&quot;. The song eventually reached number fourteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number ten on the R&amp;B chart, going gold. &quot;Unforgettable...with Love&quot; eventually sold more than 7 million copies in the U.S. alone and won several Grammys, including Album of the Year, Record of the Year and Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance for the top song.

Alongside signing for new material with Elektra, she transferred rights of her EMI-Manhattan catalog.

Cole followed that success with another album of jazz standards, titled &quot;Take a Look&quot;, in 1993, which included her recording of the title track in the same styling that her idol Aretha Franklin had recorded nearly 30 years earlier. The album eventually went gold while a holiday album, &quot;Holly &amp; Ivy&quot;, also became gold. Another standards release, &quot;Stardust&quot;, went platinum and featured another duet with her father on a modern version of &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot;, which helped Cole earn another Grammy for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.

In 1995, Cole was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from the Berklee College of Music.

In 1999, Cole returned to her 1980s-era urban contemporary recording style with the release of &quot;Snowfall on the Sahara&quot; on June and second Christmas album &quot;The Magic of Christmas&quot; on October, which recorded with London Symphony Orchestra. A year later, the singer collaborated on the production of her biopic, &quot;Livin&#x27; for Love: The Natalie Cole Story&quot; with Theresa Randle playing Natalie Cole. She also released the compilation &quot;Greatest Hits, Vol. 1&quot; to fulfill her contract with Elektra. All albums she recorded for Elektra and EMI-Manhattan are no longer controlled by Warner Music Group; they were sold to Concord Music Group and are available digitally via Craft Recordings division.

She changed to Verve Records and released two albums. &quot;Ask a Woman Who Knows&quot; (2002) continued her jazz aspirations, while &quot;Leavin&quot; (2006) was an album of pop, rock, and R&amp;B songs. Her version of &quot;Daydreaming&quot; by Aretha Franklin was a minor hit on the R&amp;B chart. In 2008, seventeen years after &quot;Unforgettable... with Love&quot;, she released &quot;Still Unforgettable&quot;, which included songs made famous by her father and Frank Sinatra. In April 2012, she appeared on the &quot;Pennington Great Performers&quot; with the Baton Rouge Symphony Orchestra.

== Television and film career ==

Cole pursued a career in acting. She appeared several times in concerts or other music related programs, including the 1988 Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute with sidemen Richard Campbell, Jeffrey Worrell, Eddie Cole, and Dave Joyce.

In 1990, Cole hosted the TV show &quot;Big Break&quot;, a talent competition where singers and musicians competed for a $100,000 prize. That year, she and Al Jarreau sang &quot;Mr. President&quot; on the television special &quot;Comic Relief&quot; special.

After Johnny Mathis appeared on a special of Cole&#x27;s in 1980, the two kept in contact, and in 1983 he invited her to be a part of his television special &quot;A Tribute to Nat Cole&quot; for the BBC in England. An album of the same name was released. In 1992, following the success of the &quot;Unforgettable: With Love&quot; album, PBS broadcast a special based on the album. &quot;Unforgettable, With Love: Natalie Cole Sings the Songs of Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole&quot; received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Program. Cole received a nomination for Outstanding Individual Performance but lost to Bette Midler.

In 1993, she was among the guests of honor attending &quot;Wrestlemania IX&quot; at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. At the 65th Academy Awards she performed a medley of two Oscar-nominated songs: &quot;Run to You&quot; and &quot;I Have Nothing&quot;, both performed by Whitney Houston in the film &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;. Cole made a number of dramatic appearances on television, including &quot;I&#x27;ll Fly Away&quot;, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;.

She had the lead role in the TV movie &quot;Lily in Winter&quot;. She appeared in the Cole Porter biopic &quot;De-Lovely&quot;. In 2001, she starred as herself in &quot;Livin&#x27; for Love: the Natalie Cole Story&quot;, for which she received the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Television Movie, Mini-Series or Dramatic Special.

On the February 5, 2007, episode of &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;, Cole sang &quot;I Say a Little Prayer&quot; at a benefit dinner. She sang the national anthem with the Atlanta University Center Chorus at Super Bowl XXVIII. In 2013, she was a guest on Tina Sinatra&#x27;s Father&#x27;s Day Special on Sirius Radio. The program included Deana Martin, Monica Mancini, and Daisy Torme reminiscing about their famous fathers.

On February 13, 2012, Cole was a guest judge on RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race Season 4 Episode 3. The episode showed DiDa Ritz and The Princess lip synching to Cole&#x27;s song, &quot;This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)&quot;. DiDa Ritz looked to actually be singing the song to Cole directly. Cole herself was so impressed she can be seen cheering and chiming in during the performance.

==Personal life==

Cole was married three times. She married Marvin Yancy, songwriter, producer, and former member of the 1970s R&amp;B group The Independents in July 1976 in Chicago. She had a son, Robert Adam &quot;Robbie&quot; Yancy (October 14, 1977 – August 14, 2017). He was a musician who toured with her.

Marvin was her producer, and an ordained Baptist minister who helped reintroduce her to religion. Under his influence, Cole changed from a lapsed Episcopalian to become a devout Baptist. Cole and Yancy divorced in 1980. Yancy died of a heart attack in 1985, aged 34.

In 1989, Cole married record producer and former drummer for the band Rufus, Andre Fischer. They divorced in 1995. In 2001, Cole married Bishop Kenneth Dupree. They divorced in 2004. In 2017, her son Robbie died of a heart attack, aged 39.

Cole was active in the Afghan World Foundation cause, supporting Sonia Nassery Cole (no relation).

===Drug use and recovery===
In 2000, Cole released an autobiography, &quot;Angel on My Shoulder&quot;, which described her battle with drugs during much of her life, including heroin and crack cocaine. At one stage of her addiction, Cole worked as a prostitute&#x27;s tout in order to fund her drug habit. Cole said she began recreational drug use while attending the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She was arrested in Toronto, Canada, for possession of heroin in 1975.

Cole spiraled out of control in this phase of her life. There was an incident in which she refused to leave a burning building, and another in which her young son Robert nearly drowned in the family swimming pool while she was on a drug binge. She entered rehab in 1983. Her autobiography was released in conjunction with a made-for-TV movie, &quot;Livin&#x27; for Love: The Natalie Cole Story&quot;, which aired December 10, 2000, on NBC and re-aired October 26, 2011, on Centric TV.

===Health and death===
Cole announced in 2008 that she had been diagnosed with hepatitis C, a liver disease spread through contact with infected blood. Cole attributed having the disease to her past intravenous drug use. Cole explained in 2009 that hepatitis C had &quot;stayed in [her] body for 25 years, and it could still happen to addicts who are fooling around with drugs, especially needles.&quot;

Four months after starting treatment for hepatitis C, Cole experienced kidney failure and required dialysis three times a week for nine months. Following her appeal for a kidney on &quot;The Larry King Show&quot;, she was contacted by the organ procurement agency One Legacy, in May 2009. The facilitated donation came from a family requesting that, if there were a match, their donor&#x27;s kidney be designated for Cole.

Cole canceled several events in December 2015 due to her illness. Her last musical performance was a short set of three songs in Manila. She died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on December 31, 2015 (New Year&#x27;s Eve), at the age of 65. Cole&#x27;s publicist said the singer&#x27;s death was the result of congestive heart failure, which her family said was a complication of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, which she had been diagnosed with after her kidney transplant in 2009. Her family said in a statement, &quot;Natalie fought a fierce, courageous battle, dying how she lived... with dignity, strength and honor. Our beloved mother and sister will be greatly missed and remain unforgettable in our hearts forever.&quot;

Cole&#x27;s funeral was held on January 11, 2016, at the West Angeles Church of God in Christ in Los Angeles. David Foster, Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, Lionel Richie, Chaka Khan, Eddie Levert, Mary Wilson, Gladys Knight, Ledisi, Jesse Jackson, Angela Bassett, Denise Nicholas, Marla Gibbs, Jackée Harry and Freda Payne were among the mourners at the funeral. After the funeral, she was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. Her grave is located in the central lawn area of the &#x27;Court of Freedom&#x27; section, Garden of Honor; there is no public access to her grave.

<doc id="423910" wikidata="Q7577466" url="?curid=423910" title="Spinal muscular atrophies">
<text>Spinal muscular atrophies (SMAs) are a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of rare debilitating disorders characterised by the degeneration of lower motor neurons (neuronal cells situated in the anterior horn of the spinal cord) and subsequent atrophy (wasting) of various muscle groups in the body. While some SMAs lead to early infant death, other diseases of this group permit normal adult life with only mild weakness.

== Classification ==

Based on the type of muscles affected, spinal muscular atrophies can be divided into:
* &quot;Proximal spinal muscular atrophies&quot;, i.e., conditions that affect primarily proximal muscles;
* &quot;Distal spinal muscular atrophies&quot; (which significantly overlap with distal hereditary motor neuronopathies) where they affect primarily distal muscles.

When taking into account prevalence, spinal muscular atrophies are traditionally divided into:
* &quot;Autosomal recessive proximal spinal muscular atrophy&quot;, responsible for 90-95% of cases and usually called simply &quot;spinal muscular atrophy&quot; (SMA) – a disorder associated with a genetic mutation on the &quot;SMN1&quot; gene on chromosome 5q (locus 5q13), diagnosed predominantly in young children and in its most severe form being the most common genetic cause of infant death if left untreated;
* &quot;Localised spinal muscular atrophies&quot; – much more rare conditions, in some instances described in but a few patients in the world, which are associated with mutations of genes other than &quot;SMN1&quot; and for this reason sometimes termed simply &quot;non-5q spinal muscular atrophies&quot;; none has currently a causal treatment.

A more detailed classification is based on the gene associated with the condition (where identified) and is presented in table below.

In all forms of SMA (with an exception of X-linked spinal muscular atrophy type 1), only motor neurons, located at the anterior horn of spinal cord, are affected; sensory neurons, which are located at the posterior horn of spinal cord, are not affected. By contrast, hereditary disorders that cause both weakness due to motor denervation along with &quot;sensory&quot; impairment due to sensory denervation are known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies (HMSN).

<text>Charles de Lint (born December 22, 1951) is a Canadian writer.

Primarily a writer of fantasy fiction, he has composed works of urban fantasy, contemporary magical realism, and mythic fiction. Along with authors like Terri Windling, Emma Bull, and John Crowley, de Lint during the 1980s pioneered and popularized the subgenre of urban fantasy. He writes novels, novellas, short stories, poetry, and lyrics. His most famous works include: the Newford series of books (&quot;Dreams Underfoot&quot;, &quot;Widdershins&quot;, &quot;The Blue Girl&quot;, &quot;The Onion Girl&quot;, &quot;Moonlight and Vines&quot;, &quot;Someplace to be Flying&quot;, etc.), as well as &quot;Moonheart&quot;, &quot;The Mystery of Grace&quot;, &quot;The Painted Boy&quot; and &quot;A Circle of Cats&quot; (children&#x27;s book illustrated by Charles Vess). His distinctive style of fantasy uses American folklore and European folklore; de Lint was influenced by many authors of mythology, folklore, and science fiction, including J. R. R. Tolkien, Lord Dunsany, William Morris, Mervyn Peake, James Branch Cabell, and E. R. Eddison. Some of his mythic fiction poetry can be found online on the Endicott Studio website.

As an essayist/critic/folklorist he writes book reviews for &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, has judged several literary awards, and has been a writer-in-residence for two public libraries.

==Personal life==
Charles de Lint was born in 1951 in Bussum, in North Holland in the Netherlands. His family emigrated to Canada when he was four months old. He grew up in Canada, as well as overseas, but has lived in Ottawa since he was age eleven.

In 1974 he met MaryAnn Harris, and they married in 1980. They lived in Ottawa. Harris was first editor of de Lint&#x27;s fiction and also his business manager.

MaryAnn Harris was hospitalized on September 6, 2021 for a rare and debilitating tick-borne virus. On his author Facebook page, de Lint announced that MaryAnn passed away as a result of the disease on June 3, 2024. Her obituary noted that she had been de Lint&#x27;s inspiration, co-musician, first editor, business manager, and artist for many of his published works. The Bruyère Foundation was suggested for memorial donations made in her name as well as to other causes that were important to her, including groups devoted to aiding youth, Indigenous peoples, animal shelters, and the environment.

==Career==
During his late twenties to early thirties, de Lint worked in a record store and played with a Celtic musical band during weekends.

===Writing===
Charles de Lint started writing in 1983 and has been a full-time writer ever since, publishing about forty books between 1984 and 1997, and 71 books (excluding foreign editions and reprints), in total, thus gaining a reputation as a master of fantasy.

Charles de Lint was one of the contributors to the 1984 &quot;Citybook II: Port O&#x27; Call&quot; role-playing game supplement from Flying Buffalo.

He published three horror novels using the pseudonym Samuel M. Key which have subsequently been reprinted by Orb Books as by Charles de Lint. He has also published a children&#x27;s book, &quot;A Circle of Cats&quot;, illustrated by artist Charles Vess.

====Style and settings====
His main genre, that of contemporary fantasy, which combines the real world with the &quot;otherworld&quot;, allows the co-existence of the natural and the supernatural. This has been termed a metaphor for the lack of indigenous folklore in most of Canada living side-by-side with the living oral traditions of the Native Americans. De Lint, however, draws upon not only North American Aboriginal culture, but also the folklore of other cultures. For example, his novel, &quot;Moonheart&quot;, uses elements of both Native American and Welsh folklore.

Many of his early books are set in Ottawa, while others (1990–2009) have been set mainly in his fictional North American city of Newford, inspired by de Lint&#x27;s favourite aspects of various North American cities. A regular set of characters are used in many different books. More recently, de Lint published an adult novel, &quot;The Mystery of Grace&quot; (Tor 2009), set in his fictional Southwestern US town, Santa de Vado Viejo, as was his most recent young adult novel, &quot;The Painted Boy&quot; (Viking 2010).

====Recognition====
De Lint has received many awards, including the 2000 World Fantasy Award for Best Collection for &quot;Moonlight and Vines&quot;, the Ontario Library Association&#x27;s White Pine Award, as well as the Great Lakes Great Books Award for his young adult novel &quot;The Blue Girl&quot; (Viking, 2004). In 1988 he won the Canadian SF/Fantasy Award, the Casper (now known as the Aurora) for his novel &quot;Jack, the Giant-killer&quot; (Ace 1987). His novel &quot;Widdershins&quot; (Tor, 2006) won first place, Amazon.com Editors&#x27; Picks: Top 10 Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Books of 2006. His 1984 urban fantasy novel, &quot;Moonheart&quot;, was a best-selling trade paperback for Tor&#x27;s Orb line. It has been described as a thriller, detective mystery, and otherworld mythic fantasy.

====Other literary work====
In addition to being the author of numerous novels and short stories, de Lint is also a poet, folklorist, and critic. His poetry can be found online in the Endicott Studio &quot;Journal of Mythic Arts&quot;. He has taught creative writing workshops in Canada and the United States, and was writer‑in‑residence for two public libraries in Ottawa. He has also written original songs; his main instruments are flute, fiddle, whistles, vocals and guitar. In 2011, de Lint released his first CD, &quot;Old Blue Truck&quot; De Lint has also been a judge for the Nebula Award, the World Fantasy Award, the Theodore Sturgeon Award and the Bram Stoker Award.

===Music and art===
De Lint plays folk, Irish and Celtic music with his wife MaryAnn; at one time playing at a local pub, and most recently doing concerts at FaerieWorlds and FaerieCon West in Seattle. He plays multiple instruments and sings and writes his own songs. In 2011 de Lint released his first album, &quot;Old Blue Truck&quot;, which was released alongside his wife MaryAnn Harris&#x27;s album, &quot;Crow Girls&quot; in which he also contributes.

<text>Earl John Hindman (; October 20, 1942  – December 29, 2003) was an American actor, best known for his roles as Bob Reid on the television soap opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; from 1975-1984 and 1988-89, and as Wilson W. Wilson on the sitcom &quot;Home Improvement&quot; from 1991-1999.

==Early years==
Hindman was born in Bisbee, Arizona, the son of Eula and Burl Latney Hindman, who worked in the oil pipeline business. He studied acting at the University of Arizona.

== Career ==
Hindman played villains in two 1974 thrillers, &quot;The Taking of Pelham One Two Three&quot; and &quot;The Parallax View&quot;. He also appeared in the films &quot;Who Killed Mary What&#x27;s &#x27;Er Name?&quot; (1971), &quot;Greased Lightning&quot; (1977), &quot;The Brink&#x27;s Job&quot; (1978), &quot;Taps&quot; (1981), &quot;Murder in Coweta County&quot; (1983). Hindman also played the part of J.T. in the Lawrence Kasdan film &quot;Silverado&quot; (1985), and the part of Satch in the Leonard Nimoy film &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot; (1987).

One of Hindman&#x27;s well-known early roles was as Bob Reid on the soap opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;. He played the role from 1975-1984 and later returned for its final episodes in 1988-89. Hindman&#x27;s wife (Molly McGreevy) was also on the soap 1977–81 as Polly Longworth, best friend to media tycoon Rae Woodard.

In one of his most famous roles, Hindman played the role of the kindly unseen neighbor Wilson W. Wilson on the television sitcom &quot;Home Improvement&quot; from 1991-1999; more accurately, Wilson was partially seen, because of a running gag that only the top of his face was visible as he talked to his neighbor from the other side of a tall fence.

His final roles included the movie &quot;Final&quot; (2001), and appearances in &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
On May 21, 1976, Hindman married Molly McGreevy, with whom he later acted in &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;. McGreevey later became an Episcopal priest.

Hindman died of lung cancer on December 29, 2003, at the age of 61, in Stamford, Connecticut.

<text>Kim Sơn (chữ Hán: , Sino-Vietnamese for &quot;Gold Mountain&quot;; ) is a family-owned chain of restaurants in Houston, Texas, that serves both Vietnamese cuisine and Chinese cuisine. As of 2009 Tri La is the owner of the restaurant group. The restaurant group headquarters is in its East Downtown restaurant.

The restaurant Kim Sơn was originally founded in Vinh Long, Vietnam, by the Kim Su Tran La. Following the Fall of Saigon, when North Vietnam conquered South Vietnam, Kim and her family fled Vietnam in 1979 to Malaysia. In 1980, the family joined relatives already in the United States. On August 16, 1980, the family arrived in the United States by boat; pirates had attacked their group in the South Pacific during their voyage. The family re-established the restaurant in Houston&#x27;s Downtown Chinatown in 1982. Kim and her husband Son oversaw all the restaurants with their seven children. Kim received vocational training at Houston Community College after arriving as a refugee.

==History==
The restaurant has an extensive menu of Chinese and Vietnamese dishes and serves weekend dim sum. In 1993, the La family opened a new $2 million, restaurant and banquet facility diagonally across from the original location. At the time it was the largest Chinese restaurant in the state of Texas. A location existed at 7531 Westheimer at Hillcroft, but it has closed.

The success of the restaurant has led to the opening of two additional full-service restaurants; one located in Stafford, Texas, and the new restaurant and ballroom at Bellaire and Wilcrest Boulevards in Houston. Both new locations are in southwest suburbs that have thriving Asian communities. The company has also opened as several smaller outlets in Houston with limited menus called &quot;Little Kim Sơn.&quot;.
The chain has become one of the best known restaurants in the state of Texas and has received accolades from magazines such as &quot;Bon Appetit&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, and &quot;Food &amp; Wine&quot;. The September 1995 issue of &quot;Bon Appetit&quot; featured Kim Sơn in an article about ethnic restaurants in the United States. The October 1998 issue of &quot;Gourmet&quot;&#x27;s reader&#x27;s choice restaurant awards ranked Kim Sơn as having the &quot;Best Value&quot; in the Houston and New Orleans areas. (The New Orleans-area restaurant, established in Gretna on the West Bank of the Mississippi River in 1988 by Tina Dieu, closed in 2018.) In 2003 Kim Sơn was ranked as the &quot;best other ethnic restaurant&quot; in the &quot;Houston Business Journal&quot;. In 2002 the same restaurant took second place in the &quot;Houston Business Journal&quot;&#x27;s rankings of the best Chinese restaurants.

In 2005, the La family opened &quot;Asia&quot; in conjunction with the new L’Auberge du Lac Hotel &amp; Casino in Lake Charles, Louisiana. In 2008, the family opened another &quot;Asia&quot; in conjunction with Boomtown New Orleans in Harvey, Louisiana.

In 1995 Allison Cook of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; described Kim Sơn as the most prominent &quot;success story as the Great Houston Restaurant Parable.&quot;

On September 24, 2023, the restaurant in Stafford closed.

Sometime in 2025, the location in East Downtown is scheduled to close as the facility will need to be cleared for more lanes for Interstate 45.

<text>Roosevelt Skerrit (born 8 June 1972) is a Dominican politician who has been Prime Minister of Dominica since 2004; he has also been the Member of Parliament for the Vieille Case constituency since 2000. Regionally, he has served as the chairman of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and most recently as chairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in 2010. Skerrit is currently the longest-serving prime minister of Dominica.

==Career==
Roosevelt Skerrit, also known as &quot;Roozey&quot; by some of his closest family and friends, became prime minister after the death of Pierre Charles in January 2004. At the time of Pierre Charles’ death, Skerrit was Member of Parliament for the Vieille Case constituency, a position he had held since his election in February 2000. In addition to being the Prime Minister, he has also served as Minister for Finance since 2004, Minister of Education, Sports and Youth Affairs, and Minister for Foreign Affairs and is the political leader of the Dominica Labor Party.

Upon taking office Skerrit became the world&#x27;s youngest head of government, surpassing Joseph Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. With his party&#x27;s May 2005 election victory, Skerrit became the world&#x27;s first democratically elected national leader born in the 1970s. As of December 2010 Skerrit remained the youngest head of government in the Western Hemisphere and the third youngest in the world, surpassed only by Madagascar&#x27;s Andry Rajoelina and Montenegro&#x27;s Igor Lukšić.

In 2015, the Chinese billionaire Ng Lap Seng was arrested by the FBI. This was due to an ongoing UN bribery investigation. Skerrit was photographed with Ng shortly before the arrest. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; stated that Ng told associates that he helped persuade Dominica to switch diplomatic recognition to China from Taiwan. The opposition party scrutinized Skerrit on the matter. Skerrit informed them that the FBI was not interested in him.

A 2019, an Al Jazeera investigation alleged that Skerrit had been receiving money in exchange for diplomatic passports and ambassadorships.

In December 2019, Skerrit won his fourth consecutive general election eighteen seats to three, becoming the first Dominica Prime Minister ever to do so.

On 1 July 2023. Prime Minister Dr Roosevelt Skerrit assumed the chairmanship of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). He also chaired the meeting of the countries under the CARICOM and asked for the innovative ways to strengthen the region.

After the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, Skerrit called for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war.

<doc id="423933" wikidata="Q212749" url="?curid=423933" title="Cracking (chemistry)">
<text>In petrochemistry, petroleum geology and organic chemistry, cracking is the process whereby complex organic molecules such as kerogens or long-chain hydrocarbons are broken down into simpler molecules such as light hydrocarbons, by the breaking of carbon–carbon bonds in the precursors. The rate of cracking and the end products are strongly dependent on the temperature and presence of catalysts. Cracking is the breakdown of large hydrocarbons into smaller, more useful alkanes and alkenes. Simply put, hydrocarbon cracking is the process of breaking long-chain hydrocarbons into short ones. This process requires high temperatures.

More loosely, outside the field of petroleum chemistry, the term &quot;cracking&quot; is used to describe any type of splitting of molecules under the influence of heat, catalysts and solvents, such as in processes of destructive distillation or pyrolysis.

Fluid catalytic cracking produces a high yield of petrol and LPG, while hydrocracking is a major source of jet fuel, diesel fuel, naphtha, and again yields LPG.

== History and patents ==

Among several variants of thermal cracking methods (variously known as the &quot;Shukhov cracking process&quot;, &quot;Burton cracking process&quot;, &quot;Burton–Humphreys cracking process&quot;, and &quot;Dubbs cracking process&quot;) Vladimir Shukhov, a Russian engineer, invented and patented the first in 1891 (Russian Empire, patent no. 12926, November 7, 1891). One installation was used to a limited extent in Russia, but development was not followed up. In the first decade of the 20th century the American engineers William Merriam Burton and Robert E. Humphreys independently developed and patented a similar process as U.S. patent 1,049,667 on June 8, 1908. Among its advantages was that both the condenser and the boiler were continuously kept under pressure.

In its earlier versions it was a batch process, rather than continuous, and many patents were to follow in the US and Europe, though not all were practical. In 1924, a delegation from the American Sinclair Oil Corporation visited Shukhov. Sinclair Oil apparently wished to suggest that the patent of Burton and Humphreys, in use by Standard Oil, was derived from Shukhov&#x27;s patent for oil cracking, as described in the Russian patent. If that could be established, it could strengthen the hand of rival American companies wishing to invalidate the Burton–Humphreys patent. In the event Shukhov satisfied the Americans that in principle Burton&#x27;s method closely resembled his 1891 patents, though his own interest in the matter was primarily to establish that &quot;the Russian oil industry could easily build a cracking apparatus according to any of the described systems without being accused by the Americans of borrowing for free&quot;.

At that time, just a few years after the Russian Revolution and Russian Civil War, the Soviet Union was desperate to develop industry and earn foreign exchange. The Soviet oil industry eventually did obtain much of their technology from foreign companies, largely American ones. At about that time, fluid catalytic cracking was being explored and developed and soon replaced most of the purely thermal cracking processes in the fossil fuel processing industry. The replacement was not complete; many types of cracking, including pure thermal cracking, still are in use, depending on the nature of the feedstock and the products required to satisfy market demands. Thermal cracking remains important, for example, in producing naphtha, gas oil, and coke; more sophisticated forms of thermal cracking have since been developed for various purposes. These include visbreaking, steam cracking, and coking.

==Cracking methodologies==
=== Thermal cracking ===
Modern high-pressure thermal cracking operates at absolute pressures of about 7,000 kPa. An overall process of disproportionation can be observed, where &quot;light&quot;, hydrogen-rich products are formed at the expense of heavier molecules which condense and are depleted of hydrogen. The actual reaction is known as homolytic fission and produces alkenes, which are the basis for the economically important production of polymers.

Thermal cracking is currently used to &quot;upgrade&quot; very heavy fractions or to produce light fractions or distillates, burner fuel and/or petroleum coke. Two extremes of the thermal cracking in terms of the product range are represented by the high-temperature process called &quot;steam cracking&quot; or pyrolysis (ca. 750 °C to 900 °C or higher) which produces valuable ethylene and other feedstocks for the petrochemical industry, and the milder-temperature delayed coking (ca. 500 °C) which can produce, under the right conditions, valuable needle coke, a highly crystalline petroleum coke used in the production of electrodes for the steel and aluminium industries.

William Merriam Burton developed one of the earliest thermal cracking processes in 1912 which operated at and an absolute pressure of and was known as the &quot;Burton process&quot;. Shortly thereafter, in 1921, C.P. Dubbs, an employee of the Universal Oil Products Company, developed a somewhat more advanced thermal cracking process which operated at and was known as the &quot;Dubbs process&quot;. The Dubbs process was used extensively by many refineries until the early 1940s when catalytic cracking came into use.

=== Steam cracking ===

Steam cracking is a petrochemical process in which saturated hydrocarbons are broken down into smaller, often unsaturated, hydrocarbons. It is the principal industrial method for producing the lighter alkenes (or commonly olefins), including ethene (or ethylene) and propene (or propylene). Steam cracker units are facilities in which a feedstock such as naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), ethane, propane or butane is thermally cracked through the use of steam in a bank of pyrolysis furnaces to produce lighter hydrocarbons.

In steam cracking, a gaseous or liquid hydrocarbon feed like naphtha, LPG or ethane is diluted with steam and briefly heated in a furnace without the presence of oxygen. Typically, the reaction temperature is very high, at around 850 °C, but the reaction is only allowed to take place very briefly. In modern cracking furnaces, the residence time is reduced to milliseconds to improve yield, resulting in gas velocities up to the speed of sound. After the cracking temperature has been reached, the gas is quickly quenched to stop the reaction in a transfer line heat exchanger or inside a quenching header using quench oil.

The products produced in the reaction depend on the composition of the feed, the hydrocarbon-to-steam ratio, and on the cracking temperature and furnace residence time. Light hydrocarbon feeds such as ethane, LPGs or light naphtha give product streams rich in the lighter alkenes, including ethylene, propylene, and butadiene. Heavier hydrocarbon (full range and heavy naphthas as well as other refinery products) feeds give some of these, but also give products rich in aromatic hydrocarbons and hydrocarbons suitable for inclusion in gasoline or fuel oil. Typical product streams include pyrolysis gasoline (pygas) and BTX.

A higher cracking temperature (also referred to as severity) favors the production of ethylene and benzene, whereas lower severity produces higher amounts of propylene, C4-hydrocarbons and liquid products. The process also results in the slow deposition of coke, a form of carbon, on the reactor walls. Since coke degrades the efficiency of the reactor, great care is taken to design reaction conditions to minimize its formation. Nonetheless, a steam cracking furnace can usually only run for a few months between de-cokings. &quot;Decokes&quot; require the furnace to be isolated from the process and then a flow of steam or a steam/air mixture is passed through the furnace coils. This decoking is essentially combustion of the carbons, converting the hard solid carbon layer to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.

===Fluid catalytic cracking===
The catalytic cracking process involves the presence of solid acid catalysts, usually silica-alumina and zeolites. The catalysts promote the formation of carbocations, which undergo processes of rearrangement and scission of C-C bonds. Relative to thermal cracking, cat cracking proceeds at milder temperatures, which saves energy. Furthermore, by operating at lower temperatures, the yield of undesirable alkenes is diminished. Alkenes cause instability of hydrocarbon fuels.

Fluid catalytic cracking is a commonly used process, and a modern oil refinery will typically include a &quot;cat cracker&quot;, particularly at refineries in the US, due to the high demand for gasoline. The process was first used around 1942 and employs a powdered catalyst. During WWII, the Allied Forces had plentiful supplies of the materials in contrast to the Axis Forces, which suffered severe shortages of gasoline and artificial rubber. Initial process implementations were based on low activity alumina catalyst and a reactor where the catalyst particles were suspended in a rising flow of feed hydrocarbons in a fluidized bed.

In newer designs, cracking takes place using a very active zeolite-based catalyst in a short-contact time vertical or upward-sloped pipe called the &quot;riser&quot;. Pre-heated feed is sprayed into the base of the riser via feed nozzles where it contacts extremely hot fluidized catalyst at . The hot catalyst vaporizes the feed and catalyzes the cracking reactions that break down the high-molecular weight oil into lighter components including LPG, gasoline, and diesel. The catalyst-hydrocarbon mixture flows upward through the riser for a few seconds, and then the mixture is separated via cyclones. The catalyst-free hydrocarbons are routed to a main fractionator for separation into fuel gas, LPG, gasoline, naphtha, light cycle oils used in diesel and jet fuel, and heavy fuel oil.

During the trip up the riser, the cracking catalyst is &quot;spent&quot; by reactions which deposit coke on the catalyst and greatly reduce activity and selectivity. The &quot;spent&quot; catalyst is disengaged from the cracked hydrocarbon vapors and sent to a stripper where it contacts steam to remove hydrocarbons remaining in the catalyst pores. The &quot;spent&quot; catalyst then flows into a fluidized-bed regenerator where air (or in some cases air plus oxygen) is used to burn off the coke to restore catalyst activity and also provide the necessary heat for the next reaction cycle, cracking being an endothermic reaction. The &quot;regenerated&quot; catalyst then flows to the base of the riser, repeating the cycle.

The gasoline produced in the FCC unit has an elevated octane rating but is less chemically stable compared to other gasoline components due to its olefinic profile. Olefins in gasoline are responsible for the formation of polymeric deposits in storage tanks, fuel ducts and injectors. The FCC LPG is an important source of C3–C4 olefins and isobutane that are essential feeds for the alkylation process and the production of polymers such as polypropylene.

====Hydrocracking====
Hydrocracking is a catalytic cracking process assisted by the presence of added hydrogen gas. Unlike a hydrotreater, hydrocracking uses hydrogen to break C–C bonds (hydrotreatment is conducted prior to hydrocracking to protect the catalysts in a hydrocracking process). In 2010, 265 million tons of petroleum was processed with this technology. The main feedstock is vacuum gas oil, a heavy fraction of petroleum.

The products of this process are saturated hydrocarbons; depending on the reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, catalyst activity) these products range from ethane, LPG to heavier hydrocarbons consisting mostly of isoparaffins. Hydrocracking is normally facilitated by a bifunctional catalyst that is capable of rearranging and breaking hydrocarbon chains as well as adding hydrogen to aromatics and olefins to produce naphthenes and alkanes.

The major products from hydrocracking are jet fuel and diesel, but low sulphur naphtha fractions and LPG are also produced. All these products have a very low content of sulfur and other contaminants with a goal of reducing the gasoil and naphtha range material to 10 PPM sulfur or lower. It is very common in Europe and Asia because those regions have high demand for diesel and kerosene. In the US, fluid catalytic cracking is more common because the demand for gasoline is higher.

The hydrocracking process depends on the nature of the feedstock and the relative rates of the two competing reactions, hydrogenation and cracking. Heavy aromatic feedstock is converted into lighter products under a wide range of very high pressures (1,000–2,000 psi) and fairly high temperatures (), in the presence of hydrogen and special catalysts.

Products from a UOP Hydrocracker
Hydrocracking is (mostly) a licensed technology due to its complexity. Typically the licensor is also the catalyst provider. Also, unit internals can often be patented by the process licensors and are designed to support specific functions of the catalyst load. Currently, the major process licensors for hydrocracking are:

* UOP
* Axens
* Chevron Lummus Global
* Topsoe
* Shell Criterion
* Elessent (formerly DuPont) 
* ExxonMobil (iso-dewaxing for lubricant hydrocracking)

==Fundamentals==
Outside of the industrial sector, cracking of C−C and C−H bonds are rare chemical reactions. In principle, ethane can undergo homolysis:
: CH3CH3 → 2 CH3⋅
Because C−C bond energy is so high (377 kJ/mol), this reaction is not observed under laboratory conditions. More common examples of cracking reactions involve retro-Diels–Alder reactions. Illustrative is the thermal cracking of dicyclopentadiene to produce cyclopentadiene.

<text>Michael A. Persinger (June 26, 1945 – August 14, 2018) was an American-Canadian professor of psychology at Laurentian University, a position he had held from 1971 until his death in 2018. His best-known hypotheses include the temporal lobes of the human brain as the central correlate for mystical experiences, subtle changes in geomagnetic activity as mediators of parapsychological phenomena, the tectonic strain within the Earth&#x27;s crust as the source of luminous phenomena attributed to unidentified aerial objects, and the importance of specific quantifications for energy (10−20 Joules), photon flux density (picoWatt per meter squared), and small shifts in magnetic field intensities (picoTesla to nanoTesla range) for integrating cellular activity as well as human thought with universal phenomena.

Persinger&#x27;s experimental work on paranormal experiences has received widespread media coverage but has also been widely criticised. His major research themes have included electromagnetic field effects upon biological organisms, epilepsy, temporal lobe functions, properties of biophotons, geophysical-human interactions, physical cosmology, and the quantifiable examination of what Persinger terms &quot;low-probability phenomena&quot; such as time travel, parallel universes, and the universe as a simulation. He has published over 500 technical articles in scientific journals (many in predatory journals), more than a dozen chapters in various books, and seven of his own books. His book with Ghislaine Lafreniere, entitled &quot;Space-Time Transients and Unusual Events&quot; (1977), documents the search for patterns in phenomena that are not compatible with current scientific paradigms.

He argued that all phenomena including consciousness, spiritual experiences, and &quot;paranormal events&quot; can be explained by universal physical mechanisms and can be verified using the scientific method. Further, he has claimed that the structure and function of the brain determine the boundaries of human perception of the universe, and that shared quantitative values connect local phenomena with fundamental properties of the cosmos.

==Early life==
Persinger attended Carroll College from 1963 to 1964 and graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1967. He received his M.A. in physiological psychology from the University of Tennessee in 1969 and his Ph.D. from the University of Manitoba in 1971.

==Research and academic work==
Persinger&#x27;s work focuses on the commonalities that exist between the sciences, and aims to integrate fundamental concepts of various branches of science. He organized the Behavioral Neuroscience Program at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario, integrating chemistry, biology, and psychology. Persinger has published hundreds of peer-reviewed academic journal articles.

=== Clinical and experimental neuropsychology ===
Most of Persinger&#x27;s published articles involved with consciousness have focused on the persistence of experiences reported by individuals who display complex partial epilepsy within the normal population of people who are creative, subject to frequent paranormal experiences, or who have sustained a mild impact of mechanical energy to the cerebrum. One of his notable experiments, spanning about three decades, involved a helmet (&quot;the God Helmet&quot;), whereby weak physiologically-patterned magnetic fields were applied across the temporal lobes of hundreds of volunteers. The research received wide media coverage with high-profile visitors to Persinger&#x27;s laboratory including Susan Blackmore and Richard Dawkins reporting positive and negative results respectively.

Experiences often associated with mystical reports such as out-of-body-experiences, intrusive thoughts, and the sensed presence were reported by hundreds of volunteers over decades of studying the phenomenon, which were not associated with the subjects&#x27; suggestibility. Subsequent theory and quantitative electroencephalographic measurements supported the contention that the sensed presence of a &quot;sentient being&quot; could be a normal brain-based prototype for god experiences or related mystical phenomena and was actually the left hemispheric awareness of the right hemispheric equivalent to the left hemispheric sense of self. Similar experiences were reported by people who had applied Todd Murphy&#x27;s technology. However, other researchers either could not replicate or only partially replicated the experimental effects with variations of the helmet. In 2014, Tinoco and colleagues reported an independent replication of an experimental protocol which measured verbal behavior associated with field exposures using the helmet configuration. In an earlier study by Richards and colleagues, semantic memory was similarly affected by applications of weak magnetic fields over the temporal lobes.

Regarding Persinger&#x27;s claims, the psychologist Richard Wiseman has written they have not been replicated and the &quot;scientific jury is unconvinced&quot;. The research has also been criticized by psychologist Craig Aaen-Stockdale, writing in The Psychologist. Other researchers have criticized Persinger for insufficient double-blinding and argued that there was no physiologically plausible mechanism by which his device could affect the brain. Persinger responded that the researchers had an incorrect computer setup and that many of his previous experiments were indeed carried out double-blind. Both claims are disputed.

=== Geophysical and human interaction research ===
One of Persinger&#x27;s lifelong endeavors has been to establish a mechanism underlying geophysical-behavioral correlates using experimental simulations. The Tectonic Strain Theory (TST) developed by Persinger and John S. Derr predicted that luminous phenomena and associated physical effects were produced by manifestations of tectonic strain that often precede by weeks to months seismic events within the region. Persinger argues that the labeling of these manifestations such as unidentified flying objects (UFOs) has changed over the centuries and reflects the characteristics of the culture despite a common mechanism. The support for the theory was primarily correlational. Persinger considered the temporal contiguity of reports of unidentified luminous phenomena preceding local seismicity due to injections of fluids a quasi-experimental support for the hypothesis. Alternative models, developed by Persinger and David Vares, were quantified for interaction between quantum values and specific magnitude earthquakes, global climate variations, interactions with population densities, discrete energies as mediators of disease, and processes by which human cognition could be covertly affected by Schumann Resonances and geomagnetic activity. The hypothesis was recently criticized by a blogger.

=== Parapsychological research ===
Persinger has stated that he studies parapsychological phenomena because &quot;the ultimate subject matter of science is the unknown&quot;. He believes that verifiable spontaneous and experimental types of parapsychological phenomena are physical and associated with non-local interactions between human brain activity and geophysical processes. For example, he claimed that the moderate strength correlation between geomagnetic activity at the time of a precognitive experience and what the geomagnetic activity would be two to three days before the event indicated that energetic antecedents before the event, not the event itself, was being discerned. During the 1980s, Persinger stated that both experimental and spontaneous cases of &quot;telepathy and clairvoyance (&quot;remote viewing&quot;) were more likely when the global geomagnetic activity was lower than the days before or afterwards. Measurement of the brain activity of &quot;psychic&quot; individuals such as Ingo Swann and Sean Harribance revealed unusual electrical brain patterns in the right hemisphere (parahippocampal region), increased photon emissions from the right cerebral hemisphere, and small decreases in the intensity of the geomagnetic field when the details of their experiences were most accurate.

== Conduct controversy at Laurentian University ==
In 2016, Persinger was controversially removed as the instructor of a first-year psychology course. Laurentian&#x27;s provost objected to Persinger&#x27;s having asked students to sign a &quot;statement of understanding&quot; that vulgar language might be used in the class. The statement included examples such as &quot;the F-word, homophobic slurs and offensive slang for genitalia&quot;.
One of my techniques is to expose people to all types of different words . . . silly words, complex words, emotional words, profane words. Because they influence how you make decisions and how you think.
The Laurentian University Faculty Association filed a grievance against the school for violating Persinger&#x27;s academic freedom. Current and former students also protested the administration&#x27;s decision. The grievance was heard on October 30, 2019, in Toronto, Ontario and on November 6, 2019, a decision was rendered by Arbitrator Kevin Burkett that Dr. Persinger was improperly removed from teaching PSYC 1105 EL in December 2015. As a result of Dr. Persinger&#x27;s grievance, &quot;In the future, Laurentian University is required to engage in a consultative process which shall include full consideration of the Collective Agreement principles including academic freedom, health and safety of the University Community, the rights, responsibilities and duties of academics and the right to a full and proper investigation&quot;.

== Death ==
Persinger died on August 14, 2018, at the age of 73.

<text>The High Court of Justiciary () is the supreme criminal court in Scotland. The High Court is both a trial court and a court of appeal. As a trial court, the High Court sits on circuit at Parliament House or in the adjacent former Sheriff Court building in the Old Town in Edinburgh, or in dedicated buildings in Glasgow and Aberdeen. The High Court sometimes sits in various smaller towns in Scotland, where it uses the local sheriff court building. As an appeal court, the High Court sits only in Edinburgh. On one occasion the High Court of Justiciary sat outside Scotland, at Zeist in the Netherlands during the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial, as the Scottish Court in the Netherlands. At Zeist the High Court sat both as a trial court, and an appeal court for the initial appeal by Abdelbaset al-Megrahi.

The president of the High Court is the Lord Justice General, who holds office &quot;ex officio&quot; by virtue of being Lord President of the Court of Session, and his depute is the Lord Justice Clerk. The remaining judges are the &quot;Lords Commissioners of Justiciary&quot;, who hold office &quot;ex officio&quot; by virtue of being appointed as Senators of the College of Justice and judges of the Court of Session. As a court of first instance trials are usually heard with a jury of 15 and a single Lord Commissioner of Justiciary; the jury can convict on a majority verdict. In some cases, such as the trial of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, a trial can be heard by a bench of judges alone; sitting without a jury. As an appeal court the hearings are always without a jury, with two judges sitting to hear an appeal against sentence, and three judges sit to hear an appeal against conviction.

The High Court will hear appeals from the sheriff courts of Scotland where the trial was under solemn proceedings; the High Court will also hear referrals on points of law from the Sheriff Appeal Court, and from summary proceedings in the sheriff courts and justice of the peace courts. Cases can be remitted to the High Court by the sheriff courts after conviction for sentencing, where a sheriff believes that their sentencing powers are inadequate. The High Court can impose a life sentence but the sheriff has a limit of five years sentencing; both can issue an unlimited fine.

As of 4 February 2025, the Lord Justice General was Lord Pentland, the Lord Justice Clerk was Lord Beckett, and there were a total of 36 Lords Commissioners of Justiciary.

==History==

=== Justiciar ===
The origins derive from the Justiciar and College of Justice, as well as from the medieval royal courts and barony courts. The medieval Justiciar (royal judge) took its name from the justices who originally travelled around Scotland hearing cases on circuit or &#x27;ayre&#x27;. From 1524, the Justiciar or a depute was required to have a &quot;permanent base&quot; in Edinburgh.

The King of Scots sometimes sat in judgment of cases in the early King&#x27;s Court, and it appears that appeals could be taken from the King&#x27;s Court to the Parliament of Scotland in civil cases but not in criminal ones. In 1532 the College of Justice was founded, separating civil and criminal jurisdiction between two distinct courts. The King&#x27;s Court was, however, normally the responsibility of the Justiciar. The Justiciar normally appointed several deputes to assist in the administration of justice, and to preside in his absence. A legally qualified clerk advised the Justiciar and his deputes as they were generally noblemen and often not legally qualified. This clerk prepared all the indictments and was keeper of the records. Eventually the influence of the clerk increased until the clerk gained both a vote in the court, and a seat on the bench as the Justice-Clerk.

=== Courts Act 1672 ===

The High Court in its modern form was founded in 1672 by the Courts Act 1672, when five of the &quot;Lords of Session&quot; (judges of the Court of Session) were added as permanent judges of the &quot;Justice Court&quot;. Previously the Lord Justice General had appointed deputes to preside in the court. From 1672 to 1887, the High Court consisted of the Lord Justice General, Lord Justice Clerk, and five Lords of Session.

The Court Act 1672 also gave statutory effect to the position of the Lord Justice Clerk, and the Lord Justice-General was made president of the Court, and the Justice-Clerk vice-president. During the period when the office of Lord Justice-General was held by noblemen the Lord Justice-Clerk was virtual head of the Justiciary Court.

=== Treaty of Union ===
Article XIX of the Treaty of Union that united Scotland and England into Great Britain preserved the High Court of Justiciary, though now the High Court was subject to the Parliament of Great Britain which could enact &quot;...regulations for the better administration of Justice&quot;. Dominic Scullion, writing in the &quot;Aberdeen Student Law Review&quot; in 2010, identified that the Union of England and Scotland saw an increase in references to English law and cases in the reports of the High Court. However, Scullion identified that it was only in the latter half of the 20th century that the judgments of the High Court were directly influenced by English decisions and precedent.

The High Court of Justiciary remained the final authority on all matters of criminal law after the Act of Union, though the Parliament of Great Britain appears to have had appellate jurisdiction through the judicial functions of the House of Lords this appeared to have little effect in practice. In 1713 a case (&quot;Magistrates of Elgin v. Ministers of Elgin&quot;) was heard by the House of Lords which overturned a decision of the High Court. However, in 1781 the House of Lords resolved that there could be no appeal from the High Court, as no right of appeal had existed beyond the Court beyond the Treaty of Union.

=== 19th Century ===

==== Unification of judiciary ====
The Court of Session Act 1830 united the offices of Lord President of the Court of Session and Lord Justice General, with the person appointed as Lord President assuming the office of Lord Justice General &quot;ex officio&quot;.

In 1834 the five Lords of Session who were appointed as Lords Commissioners of Justiciary were paid an additional allowance of over their basic salary of . A Select Committee of the House of Commons was appointed to investigate the remuneration and working conditions of the Lords of Session and Lords Commissioners of Justiciary. The Select Committee recommended that all the Lords of Session should be made Lords Commissioners of Justiciary and that the additional allowance be abolished. At the same time the Committee recommended that the basic salary of a Senator be increased to .

The membership of the court remained unchanged until 1887 when all of the Senators of the College of Justice were made Lords Commissioners of Justiciary, by the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1887. Writing in 1896, Charles Pearson attested that no appeal was competent from the High Court to the House of Lords.

==== Supremacy of High Court ====
The House of Lords made a final determination in the case of &quot;Mackintosh v. Lord Advocate (1876) 2 App. Cas. 41&quot; that it had no jurisdiction over criminal appeals, as it had inherited the power of the Parliament of Scotland to hear civil appeals, but that the pre-union Parliament did not have any jurisdiction to hear criminal appeals.

=== 20th Century ===
====Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995====
In 1913, Edwin Keedy, writing in the &quot;Journal of the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology&quot;, would affirm that the High Court &quot;is the Supreme Court for the trial of criminal causes&quot;.

The supremacy of the High Court was affirmed by Section 124 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, which stated:

====Scottish devolution====
Scottish devolution and the establishment of the Scottish Parliament by the Scotland Act 1998 introduced the right to refer points of law to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Such points of law related to human rights compatibility issues or related to devolution issues. Devolution issues are concerned with the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament and the executive functions of the Scottish Government under the Scotland Act 1998.

=== 21st century ===
====Scottish Court in the Netherlands====
From May 2000 until March 2002 the High Court of Justiciary sat as the Scottish Court in the Netherlands to try Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. The Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial required a treaty between the Government of the United Kingdom and Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands which created extraterritoriality for the Scottish Court, with Camp Zeist in Utrecht (a disused United States Air Force base) made a subject of Scots law.

Legal effect was given to the treaty in the United Kingdom by the High Court of Justiciary Order 1998, an Order in Council. The order empowered the Lord Justice Clerk to appoint three Lords Commissioners of Justiciary to sit as bench trial as both trier of fact and for determining any points of law. The High Court had full authority to determine contempt of court relating to the proceedings.

Following the conviction, which was upheld on appeal of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the Scottish Court in the Netherlands ceased to sit. Subsequent appeals were heard in Scotland.

==== Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ====
The jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in human rights and devolution issues was transferred to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. Such a transfer was not without controversy, as commentators, including the Law Society of Scotland and the Advocate General for Scotland, noted that this notionally placed an English court in a position of superiority to the High Court.

In May 2013, the Supreme Court&#x27;s guidance on its jurisdiction over Scottish appeals stated that:

Section 35 of the Scotland Act 2012 modified the procedure for referrals by removing the ability of the Supreme Court to determine the final judgment of the case; in essence a criminal case cannot be &quot;remitted&quot; to the Supreme Court. The Scotland Act 2012 requires that once the point of law has been decided upon by the Supreme Court, it is for the High Court to resolve the case. An issue can be referred to the Supreme Court either by the Lords Commissioners of Justiciary who are presiding, the Lord Advocate, or the Advocate General for Scotland. Though where two or more Lords Commissioners are presiding they may determine the human rights issue without referral to the Supreme Court.

==Remit and jurisdiction==

===First instance jurisdiction===

The High Court has jurisdiction over all crimes in Scotland unless restricted by statute. The High Court has exclusive jurisdiction over serious crimes such as treason, murder, and rape and, in practice, deals with armed robbery, drug trafficking, and sexual offences involving children (over which it shares jurisdiction with the sheriff court).

As a court of first instance the court sits regularly in various places in Scotland, with permanent seats in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. There are sittings when required in Dumbarton, Lanark, Livingston, Paisley and Stirling.

Trials in the High Court are usually jury trials, with a single Lord Commissioner of Justiciary presiding (although two or more judges may sit in important or difficult cases) with a jury of fifteen individuals; in Scotland this is known as solemn proceedings. Under the Scottish legal system, the jury can convict on a majority verdict of at least eight jurors, and need not return a unanimous verdict. The Scottish legal system also permits a verdict of &#x27;not proven&#x27; as well as verdicts of &#x27;guilty&#x27; or &#x27;not guilty&#x27;. Juries may add a rider to their verdict as additional commentary on their verdict. The &#x27;not proven&#x27; verdict is of the same consequence as &#x27;not guilty&#x27;, though there remains some confusion and disagreement over the meaning of either verdict. If eight jurors cannot agree on an accused&#x27;s guilt or on an alternative verdict, then the accused will be acquitted.

Cases in the High Court are prosecuted in the public interest by the Lord Advocate, who is usually represented in such cases by Advocates Depute. A private prosecution can be brought before the High Court, but this is very rare and difficult as it requires the concurrence of the Lord Advocate and for the High Court to issue a &quot;bill for criminal letters&quot;. When families of the victims of the 2014 Glasgow bin lorry crash applied for such a bill, their request was denied by the High Court in 2016 on the basis that there was insufficient evidence. The Lord Justice Clerk, Lady Dorrian, along with Lord Menzies and Lord Drummond Young further concluded that the case did not present special circumstances to enable granting of the bill.

Bail can be granted by the High Court to any accused person and &quot;bail is to be granted to an accused person except where there is good reason for refusing bail.&quot; The Bail, Judicial Appointments etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, an Act of the Scottish Parliament, had removed the previous restrictions on bail that meant that murder and treason were not ordinarily bailable. However, a person could be bailed when accused of these of crimes on application of the Lord Advocate or by a decision of the High Court itself. The Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007 did reintroduce restrictions on the granting of bail by requiring exceptional circumstances to be shown when a person is accused of violent, sexual, or drugs offences, and they have a prior conviction for a similar offence.

In Scotland, the focus is normally for those who are opposed to bail to convince the courts that bail should not be granted, with the procurator fiscal given guidance to use the nature and gravity of an offence as grounds to oppose bail.

===Sentencing on conviction by sheriff court===
Following a conviction under solemn proceedings in a sheriff court, Section 195 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 allows a sheriff to remit the case to the High Court for sentencing, should the sheriff believes their powers of sentencing to be inadequate for the crime committed. A sheriff in solemn proceedings can impose a maximum sentence of up to 5 years imprisonment or an unlimited fine, and the High Court can impose a life sentence (unless a lesser maximum sentence is prescribed by statute) as well as an unlimited fine. Once a case is remitted, the High Court can treat the case as if it had been tried before a Lord Commissioner of Justiciary.

===Appellate jurisdiction===
Following the Criminal Appeal (Scotland) Act 1926 (16 &amp; 17 Geo. 5. c. 15), when the Scottish High Court of Justiciary hears criminal appeals, it is known as the Court of Criminal Appeal. The Criminal Appeal (Scotland) Act 1927 (17 &amp; 18 Geo. 5. c. 26) was passed the following year specifically to deal with the Case of Oscar Slater.

The court consists of at least three judges when hearing appeals against conviction and two when hearing appeals against sentence, although more judges may sit when the court is dealing with exceptionally difficult cases or those where important matters of law may be considered. This is known as a full bench. Appeals by right are heard from the High Court of Justiciary (sitting at first instance) and sheriff courts sitting in solemn procedure; with appeals, with leave, on questions of law are heard from the Sheriff Appeal Court. Appeals against sentence or conviction in summary proceedings before the sheriff courts or justice of the peace courts are heard before the Sheriff Appeal Court. The High Court also hears appeals in cases referred to it by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission.

Leave to appeal is granted by a Lord Commissioner of Justiciary in chambers under sections 106 and 107 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 when a person is convicted in solemn procedure in either the High Court or sheriff courts, with the High Court sitting as the Appeal Court.

Appeals against convictions or sentence in summary procedure heard in sheriff courts and justice of the peace courts are now heard by the Sheriff Appeal Court. However, referrals on points of law may be heard in the High Court from the Sheriff Appeal Court with the permission of the High Court. Two judges sit to hear an appeal against sentence, and three judges sit to hear an appeal against conviction. The High Court of Justiciary sits as an appeal court in Edinburgh.

The High Court, as a collegiate court, has the ability to convene a bench of greater numbers of Lords Commissioners of Justiciary to overturn decisions and precedent established by previous appeals. Such a decision is made by the High Court on its own initiative. It is possible for the entire High Court to sit in determination of an appeal.

In exceptional circumstances, a person may petition the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission, who have the authority to refer an appeal back to the High Court of Justiciary, if the Commission determine that a miscarriage of justice has or might have occurred.

Under Section 35 of the Scotland Act 2012, the High Court as an Appeal Court will also hear referrals on human rights compatibility issues from the Sheriff Appeal Court, sheriff courts, and from cases being heard at first-instance by a single Lord Commissioner of Justiciary. The High Court can then make a determination on that issue, or it can refer the matter to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.

===Appeals from the High Court===

==== Devolution and human rights issues ====
The High Court of Justiciary has the final authority on matters of criminal law in Scotland, and thus no appeal beyond the High Court is possible on the grounds of sentence or conviction. However, it is possible to refer a point of law to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom relating to human rights compatibility issues or relating to devolution issues. Devolution issues are concerned with the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament and the executive functions of the Scottish Government under the Scotland Act 1998. Such referrals are made to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom under Schedule 6 of the Scotland Act 1998 or Section 288A of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. For a referral to proceed permission must be granted by two or more Lords Commissioners of Justiciary, or by the Supreme Court itself.

The most frequent devolution issues raised related to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which mandates the right to a fair trial, and the role of the Lord Advocate who is both the chief public prosecutor and a member of the Scottish Government. Under the Scotland Act 1998 the Lord Advocate could do nothing that was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, and should his actions be deemed incomparable then they were null and void. This led to the case of &quot;Cadder v HM Advocate&quot; where the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled that the police in Scotland could not question a suspect without granting that person access to a solicitor. This was one case, along with &quot;Fraser v HM Advocate&quot;, that led the Scottish Government to raise concerns with HM Government that it appeared that &quot;virtually any objection, challenge, or point of law can be characterised as a devolution issue&quot;, thus undermining the High Court&#x27;s final jurisdiction in criminal matters. The Scotland Act 2012 modified provisions around devolution issues by no longer rendering null and void those actions of the Lord Advocate that were incompatible with the European Convention, but still allowing a right to appeal against those actions on grounds of incompatibility.

==== Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ====
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom was established by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, and is the highest court in the United Kingdom for civil cases and those matters relating to human rights and devolution. Prior to the establishment of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom devolution issues were decided by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, whose members were the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (who exercised the judicial functions of the House of Lords.) However, the two bodies were legally and constitutionally separate.

===Acts of Adjournal===

The High Court of Justiciary as a Court, or the Lord Justice General, Lord Justice Clerk and Lords Commissioners of Justiciary as a body, have the power to regulate criminal procedure in the criminal courts in Scotland: regulations can be made for the High Court, sheriff courts (summary and solemn procedures), and the justice of the peace courts. Such regulations are promulgated by Acts of Adjournal, which take the form of subordinate legislation as Scottish Statutory Instruments, under powers granted by Section 305 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. Schedule 6 of the Scotland Act 1998 also grants that Acts of Adjournal can be used to regulate the procedure for referring a question of law relating to a devolution issue to either the High Court or the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.

Section 305 of the 1995 Act states:

Thus the Lord Justice General, Lord Justice Clerk, and Lords Commissioners of Justiciary have the power to modify and amend primary legislation, where that primary legislation deals with a matter of criminal procedure. The Criminal Courts Rules Council on 8 February 2016 considered Section 288BA of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 (which prescribes rules for dockets and indictments for sexual offences) and asked the Lord President&#x27;s Private Office to consider if this could be modified by Act of Adjournal. A draft Act of Adjournal was also prepared in 2011 to amend the 1995 Act as the Rules Council was awaiting primary legislation, and the Rules Council agreed to proceed with the Act of Adjournal. The Act of Adjournal amended the 1995 Act by adding Sections 75C and 137ZB to enable the court to discharge, vary and change the diet (sittings) of a case.

==Rights of audience==
Members of the Faculty of Advocates, known as advocates or counsel, and as of 1990 also some solicitors, known as solicitor-advocates, have practically exclusive right of audience rights of audience in the court. Until 1990 only advocates had any right of audience before the High Court, but the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland Act) 1990 allowed solicitors to apply for enhanced rights and become solicitor-advocates.

==Judges and office holders==

=== President and judges ===
The court&#x27;s president is the Lord Justice General; the second most senior judge is the Lord Justice Clerk; and a further 35 Senators of the College of Justice hold office as Lords Commissioners of Justiciary. The total numbers of judges is fixed by Section 1 of the Court of Session Act 1988, subject to amendment by Order in Council (the last order was made in 2022 and increased the number of judges to 36.) Judges are appointed for life, subject to dismissal if they are found unfit for office, and subject to a compulsory retirement age of 75.

The court is a unitary collegiate court, with all judges other than the Lord Justice General and the Lord Justice Clerk holding the same rank and title: Lord Commissioner of Justiciary. There are 36, in addition to a number of temporary judges; these temporary judges can be sheriffs principal, sheriffs, or advocates in private practice. The judges sit also in the Court of Session, where they are known as &quot;Lords of Council and Session&quot;; in the Court of Session the Lord Justice General is called the Lord President of the Court of Session.

====Lord Justice General====

The Lord Justice General is the most senior judge of the High Court of Justiciary. The Lord Justice General will sit as chairperson in the Court of Criminal Appeal.

====Lord Justice Clerk====

The Justice Clerk is the second most senior judge of the High Court, and deputises for the Lord Justice General when the latter is absent, or is unable to fulfil his duties, or when there is a vacancy for Lord Justice General. The Lord Justice Clerk will sit as chairperson in the Court of Criminal Appeal.

====Lords Commissioners of Justiciary====
===Appointment===
To be eligible for appointment as a Lord Commissioner of Justiciary, or temporary judge, a person must have served at least 5 years as sheriff or sheriff principal; or been an advocate for 5 years, or a solicitor with 5 years rights of audience before the Court of Session or High Court of Justiciary; or been a Writer to the Signet for 10 years (having passed the exam in civil law at least 2 years before application.)

Appointments are made by the Monarch on the recommendation of the First Minister of Scotland following a recruitment exercise undertaken by the Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland. The Judicial Appointments Board has statutory authority to make recommendations under Sections 9 to 27 of the Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Act 2008 (as amended by the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014). Appointments to the Inner House are made by the Lord President and Lord Justice Clerk, with the consent of the Scottish Ministers.

Temporary judges can also be appointed by the Scottish Ministers provided that person would also be eligible for appointment as permanent judge of the High Court. Originally the power was granted by Section 35 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990, but the enactment was repealed and replaced by Section 123 of the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014. Such temporary judges are appointed for a period of 5 years.

Section 123 of Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014 allows the Lord Justice General to appoint former senators, and former Justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, to the High Court provided they are under 75 years of age. The tenure of such appointments is determined by the Lord Justice General.

Lord Gill, Lord Justice General from 2012 to 2015, issued guidance in 2013 on the use temporary judges which stipulated that:

Further stating that the preference would be to allocate business to temporary judges who were already, had previously been, a &quot;judicial office holder&quot; (namely, sheriff principal or sheriff); as opposed to using temporary judges who were practising advocates or solicitor-advocates. Lord Gill&#x27;s guidance allows for such judges to be allocated to any first instance business of the High Court, but requires the approval of the Lord Justice General for their deployment in the Appeal Court.

===Removal from office===
The Lord Justice General, Lord Justice Clerk and the Lords Commissioners of Justiciary can only be removed office after a tribunal has been convened to examine their fitness for office. The tribunal is convened at the request of the Lord Justice General (in his capacity as Lord President) or in other circumstances if the First Minister sees fit. However, the First Minister must consult the Lord Justice General (or the Lord Justice Clerk, if the Lord Justice General is under investigation). Should the tribunal recommend their dismissal the Scottish Parliament can resolve that the First Minister make a recommendation to the Monarch.

===Principal Clerk of Session and Justiciary===
The administration of the court is part of the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service, and is led by the Principal Clerk of Session and Justiciary. The Principal Clerk is responsible for the administration of the Supreme Courts of Scotland and their associated staff. the Principal Clerk was Graeme Marwick, who was also Director of the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service.

<doc id="423942" wikidata="Q752559" url="?curid=423942" title="Flag of Ohio">
<text>The Ohio Burgee is the official flag of the U.S. state of Ohio. It is a distinctive triangular swallowtail flag. Its red, white, and blue elements symbolize the state&#x27;s natural features and order of admission into the Union. A prominent disc in the flag&#x27;s triangular canton is suggestive of the state&#x27;s name. The flag was adopted in 1902.

The flag was designed in 1901 by John Eisenmann for the Pan-American Exposition and adopted in 1902. Before that, for nearly a century after statehood, Ohio did not have a legally authorized state flag. One unsuccessful proposal had called for a design based on the state seal.

Ohio has adopted an official salute to the flag and the official folding procedure gives it 17 folds. The Ohio flag has influenced a number of logos and municipal flags within the state. A scarlet-colored gubernatorial flag is based on the state seal.

==Design==
The Ohio state flag&#x27;s design is defined in the Ohio Revised Code, section 5.01:

In addition to resembling the letter O and a buckeye nut, the flag&#x27;s also represents &quot;the original territory of Ohio&quot; in the Northwest Territory.

Ohio&#x27;s flag is the only non-rectangular U.S. state flag. It is a rare example of a non-quadrilateral civil flag. According to vexillologist Whitney Smith, it may be loosely based upon cavalry flags of the Civil War and Spanish–American War. The flag has been officially defined as a &quot;burgee&quot; since 2002, even though burgees are typically used as maritime flags. Its shape, lack of text, and mirror symmetry allow it to be flown or hung in various orientations without affecting legibility. On account of the flag&#x27;s uncommon shape, foreign manufacturers have occasionally set the entire design against a white, rectangular field.

== History ==
For nearly a century after statehood, Ohio did not have a legally authorized state flag. The state militia carried regimental colors based on the Stars and Stripes, with the addition of &quot;a large eagle, with the number of the regiment and the prescribed number of stars above&quot;.

=== Arsenal flag ===
By the early 1850s, Ohio expressed interest in adopting a state flag, as several other states had already done. In late 1860, Quartermaster General David L. Wood and Adjutant General Henry B. Carrington devised a flag consisting of the state seal upon a white field. They had it flown above the Ohio State Arsenal in Columbus, in hopes that it might someday become the state flag. On January 17, 1861, at a banquet organized by the Columbus Typographical Union Local #5, future U.S. President James A. Garfield gave a speech defending the national flag as the only flag Ohio&#x27;s soldiers would march to battle under. The generals, in attendance, were moved to set aside their proposal and hoist the Stars and Stripes in its place. Later that year, Wood and Carrington joined fellow Ohioans in battle under the 34-star Union flag, which would serve as the inspiration for a state banner decades later.

=== Eisenmann&#x27;s guidon ===
In 1901, Cleveland architect John Eisenmann was commissioned to design an exhibition hall for his state at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. He developed a distinctive flag to fly over each corner of the Ohio Building. The wool flags officially represented the Ohio Pan-American Exposition Commission rather than the state. On July 18, Governor George K. Nash visited the exposition, where he was presented with one of the flags, which is now held in the Ohio History Connection collections. Eisenmann secured a U.S. design patent for his design, which he described as &quot;a triangular forked or swallow-tailed flag corresponding to the shape generally known as a &#x27;cavalry-guidon&#x27; or &#x27;broad pennant.&#x27;&quot;

In 1902, State Representative William S. McKinnon, a member of the Ohio Pan-American Exposition Commission, introduced House Bill 213 designating Eisenmann&#x27;s design as the official flag. It became law on May 9, making it the 20th U.S. state flag or banner. (Eisenmann had assigned his patent, which had a term of three and a half years, to the State of Ohio on April 24.)

Because Eisenmann&#x27;s design deviated from the &quot;seal on a bedsheet&quot; design then nearly universal among state flags, the press looked overseas for precedents: the layout was likened to either the flag of Cuba or of the Philippines, while the red and white annulus was derided for its similarity to the sun on the Japanese flag.

Initially, Ohio&#x27;s flag was seldom used, in part due to the prevailing opinion that the Stars and Stripes should hold a monopoly on patriotic displays. Similar sentiment hindered the adoption of municipal flags in Cleveland and Cincinnati, to the extent that both were downplayed as mere &quot;banners&quot; for promotional purposes. In 1903, it was reported that, among state politicians, only Nash displayed the guidon.

In the century following its adoption, the guidon gained significant popularity, being flown not only by the state but frequently also by its residents and businesses.

== Usage ==

=== Salute ===
In 2002, the Ohio General Assembly commemorated the 100th anniversary of the state flag&#x27;s adoption by adopting a salute to the flag, to be recited after the Pledge of Allegiance:

===Folding the flag===
A method of folding the flag of Ohio was created by Alex Weinstock, a Boy Scout from Junction City, for his Eagle Scout service project. It requires two people. The procedure was passed by the 125th Ohio General Assembly as House Bill 552 and signed into law by Governor Bob Taft on February 15, 2005:

Ohio is not the only state that has designated a folding procedure for its flag; however, Ohio&#x27;s procedure takes on special importance due to the flag&#x27;s irregular shape. A flag vendor in Arkansas has described the procedure as &quot;quite a challenge&quot;.

=== Derivations ===
Ohio&#x27;s flag is regularly flown during football games by Ohio State University Marching Band&#x27;s &quot;JI-Row&quot; as the percussion section&#x27;s row mascot. The Columbus Blue Jackets logo and Cincinnati Bengals fan flag are both based on the state flag.

A number of municipalities and counties in Ohio have adopted pennants and swallowtails based on the state burgee. Adams County and the cities of Marysville and Mentor have flags that essentially replace the annulus with a seal and modify the pattern of stars in the triangular union. Additionally, the city of Green uses a burgee for the city flag, altering the colors to green and white stripes, as opposed to the original red and white on the Ohio state flag.

== Flag of the governor ==
The flag of the governor of Ohio consists of the Great Seal of Ohio encircled with 13 white stars on a scarlet field, with a five-point star in each corner. Like the state flag, it has 17 stars in total.

The adjutant general&#x27;s office adopted this design in 1905 to represent the governor on official occasions. One such flag hangs in the Rutherford B. Hayes Center Library, a memorial to the 32nd Ohio governor and 19th U.S. president. The design was officially recognized by the 96th General Assembly effective October 3, 1945:

Since September 30, 1963, the flag has been defined in greater detail:

The Ohio Revised Code also specifies smaller versions of this design to be used as the governor&#x27;s naval flag and automobile flag.

<text>The rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), colloquially rhesus monkey, is a species of Old World monkey. There are between six and nine recognised subspecies split between two groups, the Chinese-derived and the Indian-derived. Generally brown or grey in colour, it is in length with a tail and weighs . It is native to South, Central, and Southeast Asia and has the widest geographic range of all non-human primates, occupying a great diversity of altitudes and habitats. 

The rhesus macaque is diurnal, arboreal, and terrestrial. It is mostly herbivorous, feeding mainly on fruit, but also eating seeds, roots, buds, bark, and cereals. Rhesus macaques living in cities also eat human food and trash. They are gregarious, with troops comprising 20–200 individuals. The social groups are matrilineal. Individuals communicate with a variety of facial expressions, vocalisations, body postures, and gestures. 

As a result of the rhesus macaque&#x27;s relatively easy upkeep, wide availability, and closeness to humans anatomically and physiologically, it has been used extensively in medical and biological research. It has facilitated many scientific breakthroughs including vaccines for rabies, smallpox, polio and antiretroviral medication to treat HIV/AIDS. A rhesus macaque became the first primate astronaut in 1948.

The rhesus is listed as Least Concern in the IUCN Red List. 

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;rhesus&quot; is reminiscent of the mythological king Rhesus of Thrace, a minor character in the Iliad. However, the French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Audebert who named the species, stated: &quot;it has no meaning&quot;. The rhesus macaque is also known colloquially as the &quot;rhesus monkey&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==

According to Zimmermann&#x27;s first description of 1780, the rhesus macaque is distributed in eastern Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, as far east as the Brahmaputra Valley, Barak valley and in peninsular India, Nepal, and northern Pakistan. Today, this is known as the Indian rhesus macaque &quot;Macaca mulatta mulatta&quot;, which includes the morphologically similar &quot;M. rhesus villosus&quot;, described by True in 1894, from Kashmir, and &quot;M. m. mcmahoni&quot;, described by Pocock in 1932 from Kootai, Pakistan. Several Chinese subspecies of rhesus macaques were described between 1867 and 1917. The molecular differences identified among populations, however, are alone not consistent enough to conclusively define any subspecies.

The Chinese subspecies can be divided as follows:
* &quot;M. m. mulatta&quot; is found in western and central China, in the south of Yunnan, and southwest of Guangxi;
* &quot;M. m. lasiota&quot; (Gray, 1868), the west Chinese rhesus macaque, is distributed in the west of Sichuan, northwest of Yunnan, and southeast of Qinghai; it is possibly synonymous with &quot;M. m. sanctijohannis&quot; (R. Swinhoe, 1867), if not with &quot;M. m. mulatta&quot;.
* &quot;M. m. tcheliensis&quot; (Milne-Edwards, 1870), the north Chinese rhesus macaque, lives in the north of Henan, south of Shanxi, and near Beijing. Some consider it as the most endangered subspecies. Others consider it possibly synonymous with &quot;M. m. sanctijohannis&quot;, if not with &quot;M. m. mulatta&quot;.
* &quot;M. m. vestita&quot; (Milne-Edwards, 1892), the Tibetan rhesus macaque, lives in the southeast of Tibet, northwest of Yunnan (Deqing), and perhaps including Yushu; it is possibly synonymous with &quot;M. m. sanctijohannis&quot;, if not with &quot;M. m. mulatta&quot;.
* &quot;M. m. littoralis&quot; (Elliot, 1909), the south Chinese rhesus macaque, lives in Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Guizhou, northwest of Guangdong, north of Guangxi, northeast of Yunnan, east of Sichuan, and south of Shaanxi; it is possibly synonymous with &quot;M. m. sanctijohannis&quot;, if not with &quot;M. m. mulatta&quot;.
* &quot;M. m. brevicaudus&quot;, also referred to as &quot;Pithecus brevicaudus&quot; (Elliot, 1913), lives on the Hainan Island and Wanshan Islands in Guangdong, and the islands near Hong Kong; it may be synonymous with &quot;M. m. mulatta&quot;.
* &quot;M. m. siamica&quot; (Kloss, 1917), the Indochinese rhesus macaque, is distributed in Myanmar, in the north of Thailand and Vietnam, in Laos, and in the Chinese provinces of Anhui, northwest Guangxi, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, central and eastern Sichuan, and western and south-central Yunnan; possibly synonymous with &quot;M. m. sanctijohannis&quot;, if not with &quot;M. m. mulatta&quot;.

== Description ==

The rhesus macaque is brown or grey in color and has a pink face, which is bereft of fur. It has, on average, 50 vertebrae and a wide rib cage. Its tail averages between . Adult males measure about on average and weigh about . Females are smaller, averaging in length and in weight. The ratio of arm length to leg length is 89.6–94.3%.

The rhesus macaque has a dental formula of and bilophodont molar teeth.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Rhesus macaques are native to India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Afghanistan, Vietnam, southern China, and some neighbouring areas. They have the widest geographic ranges of any non-human primate, occupying a great diversity of altitudes throughout Central, South, and Southeast Asia. Inhabiting arid, open areas, rhesus macaques may be found in grasslands, woodlands, and in mountainous regions up to in elevation. They are strong swimmers, and can swim across rivers. Rhesus macaques are noted for their tendency to move from rural to urban areas, coming to rely on handouts or refuse from humans. They adapt well to human presence, and form larger troops in human-dominated landscapes than in forests. Rhesus monkeys live in patches of forest within agricultural areas, which gives them access to agroecosystem habitats and makes them at ease in navigating through them.

The southern and the northern distributional limits for rhesus and bonnet macaques, respectively, currently run parallel to each other in the western part of India, are separated by a large gap in the center, and converge on the eastern coast of the peninsula to form a distribution overlap zone. This overlap region is characterized by the presence of mixed-species troops, with pure troops of both species sometimes occurring even in close proximity to one another. The range extension of rhesus macaque – a natural process in some areas, and a direct consequence of introduction by humans in other regions – poses grave implications for the endemic and declining populations of bonnet macaques in southern India.

Kumar et al (2013) provides a summary of population distribution and habitat in India. It states that there were sightings of rhesus macaques in all surveyed habitats except semi-evergreen forests.

===Fossil record===
Fossilized isolated teeth and mandible fragments from Tianyuan Cave and a juvenile maxilla from Wanglaopu Cave near Zhoukoudian represent the first recognized occurrence of rhesus macaque fossils in the far north of China, and thus the population of rhesus macaques which lived around Beijing decades ago is believed to have originated from Pleistocene ancestors rather than being human-introduced. Fossil mandible fragments from the Taedong River Basin around Pyongyang, North Korea, have also been assigned to this species.

=== Exogenous colonies ===
Rhesus macaques have also been introduced and acclimated to other areas, such as the United States, where they are considered an invasive species. Colonies have been established in Florida, Puerto Rico, and South Carolina

Around the spring of 1938, a colony of rhesus macaques was released in and around Silver Springs in Florida by a tour boat operator known locally as &quot;Colonel Tooey&quot; to enhance his &quot;Jungle Cruise&quot;. Tooey had been hoping to profit from the boom in jungle adventure stories in film and print media, buying the monkeys to be attractions at his river boat tour. Tooey apparently hadn&#x27;t been aware of rhesus macaques being proficient swimmers, meaning his original plan to keep the monkeys isolated to an island inside the river didn&#x27;t work. The macaques nevertheless remained in the region thanks to daily feedings by Tooey and the boat tours. Tooey subsequently released additional monkeys to add to the gene pool and avoid inbreeding. The traditional story that the monkeys were released for scenery enhancement in the Tarzan movies that were filmed at that location is false, as the only Tarzan movie filmed in the area, 1939&#x27;s &quot;Tarzan Finds a Son!&quot;, does not contain rhesus macaques. Whilst this was the first colony established and the longest lasting, other colonies have since been established intentionally or accidentally. A population in Titusville, Florida, was featured at the now defunct Tropical Wonderland theme park, which coincidentally was at one time endorsed by Johnny Weissmuller, who had portrayed Tarzan in the aforementioned films. This association might have contributed to the misconception the monkeys were associated directly with the Tarzan films. This colony either escaped or was intentionally released, roaming the woods of the area for a decade. In the 1980s a trapper captured several monkeys from the Titusville population and released them in the Silver Springs area to join that population. The last printed records of monkeys in the Titusville area occurred in early 1990s, but sightings continue to this day.

Various colonies of rhesus macaque are speculated to be the result of zoos and wildlife parks destroyed in hurricanes, most notably Hurricane Andrew. A 2020 estimate put the number at 550–600 rhesus macaques living in the state; officials have caught more than 1,000 of the monkeys in the past decade. Most of the captured monkeys tested positive for herpes B virus, which leads wildlife officials to consider the animals a public health hazard. Of the three monkey species to have had any lasting presence in Florida, the other two being African vervet monkeys and South American squirrel monkeys, the Rhesus macaques have endured the longest and are the only ones to show continual population growth. The species&#x27; adaptable nature, generalized diet, and larger size as to reduce the chance of cold stress or predator attack are thought to be reasons for their success.

Despite the risks, the macaques have continued to enjoy long-standing support from residents in Florida, strongly disagreeing with their removal. The Silver Springs colony has continued to grow in size and range, being commonly sighted in both the park grounds, the nearby city of Ocala, Florida, and the neighboring Ocala National Forest. Individuals likely originating from this colony have been seen hundreds of kilometers away, in St. Augustine, Florida and St. Petersburg, Florida. One infamous individual, named the &quot;Mystery Monkey of Tampa Bay&quot;, evaded capture for years, inspiring social media posts and a song.

Exogenous colonies have also resulted from research activities. There is a colony of rhesus macaques on Morgan Island, one of the Sea Islands in the South Carolina Lowcountry. They were imported in the 1970s for use in the local labs. Another research colony was established by the Caribbean Primate Research Center of the University of Puerto Rico on the island of Cayo Santiago, off of Puerto Rico. There are no predators on the island, and humans are not permitted to land, except as part of the research program. Another Puerto Rico research colony was released into the Desecheo National Wildlife Refuge in 1966. they are continuing to do ecological harm, damage crops amounting to $300,000/year and cost $1,000,000/year to manage.

== Ecology and behavior ==

The Rhesus macaque is diurnal, and both arboreal and terrestrial. It is quadrupedal and, when on the ground, it walks digitigrade and plantigrade. It is mostly herbivorous, feeding mainly on fruit, but also eating seeds, roots, buds, bark, and cereals. It is estimated to consume around 99 different plant species in 46 families. During the monsoon season, it gets much of its water from ripe and succulent fruit. Rhesus macaques living far from water sources lick dewdrops from leaves and drink rainwater accumulated in tree hollows. They have also been observed eating termites, grasshoppers, ants, and beetles. When food is abundant, they are distributed in patches, and forage throughout the day in their home ranges. They drink water when foraging, and gather around streams and rivers. Rhesus macaques have specialized pouch-like cheeks, allowing them to temporarily hoard their food.
It has specialised cheek pouches where it can temporarily store food and also eats invertebrates, including adult and larval insects, spiders, lice, honeycombs, crabs and bird eggs. With an increase in anthropogenic land changes, the rhesus macaque has evolved alongside intense and rapid environmental disturbance associated with human agriculture and urbanization resulting in proportions of their diet to be altered.

In psychological research, rhesus macaques have demonstrated a variety of complex cognitive abilities, including the ability to make same-different judgments, understand simple rules, and monitor their own mental states. They have even been shown to demonstrate self-agency, an important type of self-awareness. In 2014, onlookers at a train station in Kanpur, India, documented a rhesus monkey, knocked unconscious by overhead power lines, that was revived by another rhesus that systematically administered a series of resuscitative actions.

=== Group structure ===

Like other macaques, rhesus troops comprise a mixture of 20–200 males and females. Females may outnumber the males by a ratio of 4:1. Males and females both have separate hierarchies. Female philopatry, common among social mammals, has been extensively studied in rhesus macaques. Females tend not to leave the social group, and have highly stable matrilineal hierarchies in which a female&#x27;s rank is dependent on the rank of her mother. In addition, a single group may have multiple matrilineal lines existing in a hierarchy, and a female outranks any unrelated females that rank lower than her mother. Rhesus macaques are unusual in that the youngest females tend to outrank their older sisters. This is likely because young females are more fit and fertile. Mothers seem to prevent the older daughters from forming coalitions against her. The youngest daughter is the most dependent on the mother, and would have nothing to gain from helping her siblings in overthrowing their mother. Since each daughter had a high rank in her early years, rebelling against her mother is discouraged. Juvenile male macaques also exist in matrilineal lines, but once they reach four to five years of age, they are driven out of their natal groups by the dominant male. Thus, adult males gain dominance by age and experience.

In the group, macaques position themselves based on rank. The &quot;central male subgroup&quot; contains the two or three oldest and most dominant males which are codominant, along with females, their infants, and juveniles. This subgroup occupies the center of the group and determines the movements, foraging, and other routines. The females of this subgroup are also the most dominant of the entire group. The farther to the periphery a subgroup is, the less dominant it is. Subgroups on the periphery of the central group are run by one dominant male, of a rank lower than the central males, and he maintains order in the group, and communicates messages between the central and peripheral males. A subgroup of subordinate, often subadult, males occupy the very edge of the groups, and have the responsibility of communicating with other macaque groups and making alarm calls. Rhesus social behaviour has been described as despotic, in that high-ranking individuals often show little tolerance, and frequently become aggressive towards non-kin. Top-ranking female rhesus monkeys are known to sexually coerce unreceptive males and also physically injure them, biting off digits and damaging their genitals.

Rhesus macaques have been observed engaging in interspecies grooming with Hanuman langurs and with Sambar deer.

=== Communication ===
Rhesus macaques interact using a variety of facial expressions, vocalizations, body postures, and gestures. Perhaps the most common facial expression the macaque makes is the &quot;silent bared teeth&quot; face. This is made between individuals of different social ranks, with the lower-ranking one giving the expression to its superior. A less-dominant individual also makes a &quot;fear grimace&quot;, accompanied by a scream, to appease or redirect aggression. Another submissive behavior is the &quot;present rump&quot;, where an individual raises its tail and exposes its genitals to the dominant one. A dominant individual threatens another individual by standing quadrupedally and making a silent &quot;open mouth stare&quot; accompanied by the tail sticking straight. During movements, macaques make coos and grunts. These are also made during affiliative interactions, and approaches before grooming. When they find rare food of high quality, macaques emit warbles, harmonic arches, or chirps. When in threatening situations, macaques emit a single loud, high-pitched sound called a shrill bark. Screeches, screams, squeaks, pant-threats, growls, and barks are used during aggressive interactions. Infants &quot;gecker&quot; to attract their mother&#x27;s attention.

=== Reproduction ===

Adult male macaques try to maximize their reproductive success by entering into sex with females both in and outside the breeding period. Females prefer to mate with males that are not familiar to them. Outsider males who are not members of the female&#x27;s own troop are preferred over higher-ranking males. Outside of the consortship period, males and females return the prior behavior of not exhibiting preferential treatment or any special relationship. The breeding period can last up to eleven days, and a female usually mates with numerous males during that time. Male rhesus macaques have been observed to fight for access to sexually receptive females and they suffer more wounds during the mating season. Female macaques first breed when they are four years old and reach menopause at around twenty-five years of age. Male macaques generally play no role in raising the young but do have peaceful relationships with the offspring of their consort pairs.

Manson and Parry found that free-ranging rhesus macaques avoid inbreeding. Adult females were never observed to copulate with males of their own matrilineage during their fertile periods.

Mothers with one or more immature daughters in addition to their infants are in contact with their infants less than those with no older immature daughters, because the mothers may pass the parenting responsibilities to their daughters. High-ranking mothers with older immature daughters also reject their infants significantly more than those without older daughters and tend to begin mating earlier in the mating season than expected based on their dates of parturition the preceding birth season. Infants farther from the center of the groups are more vulnerable to infanticide from outside groups. Some mothers abuse their infants, which is believed to be the result of controlling parenting styles.

===Aging===

The rhesus monkey has been used as a model for studying aging of the ovaries of primate females. Ovarian aging was found to be associated with increased DNA double strand breaks and reduced DNA repair in granulosa cells, that is, somatic cells closely associated with developing oocytes.

=== Self-awareness ===
In several experiments giving mirrors to rhesus monkeys, they looked into the mirrors and groomed themselves, as well as flexed various muscle groups. This behaviour indicates that they recognised and were aware of themselves.

=== Human–rhesus conflict ===
The macaque–human relationships is complex and culturally specific, ranging from relatively peaceful coexistence to extreme levels of conflict. Conflicts tend to result from rapidly changing agricultural practices, increasing urbanisation, and clearing of woodlands and other territory, pushing macaques into human settlements in the search for resources. A 2021 study stated that human-macaque conflict is one of the most critical challenges faced by wildlife managers in the South- and Southeast-Asian regions. 

Conflict between rhesus macaques and humans is at all-time high, with areas once forested habitat being converted to industrial agriculture. In Nepal, the expansion of monocultures, increased forest fragmentation, degradation of natural habitats and changing agricultural practices have led to a significant increase in the frequency of human-macaque conflict. Crop raiding is one of the biggest visible effects of human-rhesus conflict. The estimated financial cost to individual farmer households of macaque corn and rice raiding is approximately US$14.9 or 4.2% of their yearly income. This has resulted in farmers and other members of the population viewing macaques inhabiting agricultural landscapes as serious crop pests. Nepal is a significant study area with almost 44% of Nepal&#x27;s land area containing suitable habitat for rhesus macaques but only having 8% of such suitable area being protected national parks. Rhesus macaques are rated as one of the top ten crop-raiding wildlife species in Nepal, which adds to their negative perception. 

Suggestions to mitigate conflict include &quot;prioritizing forest restoration programs, strategic management plans designed to connect isolated forest fragments with high rhesus macaque population densities, creating government programs that compensate farmers for income lost due to crop-raiding, and educational outreach that informs local villagers of the importance of conservation and protecting biodiversity&quot;. Mitigation strategies offers the most effective solutions to reduce conflict occurring between rhesus macaques and humans in Nepal.

India is another country that is seeing the rise of human-macaque conflict. Macaque-human conflict particularly occurs in the twin hill-states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh with such conflict being a source of contentious debate in political scenarios, resentment and polarization amongst agriculturalists and wildlife conservationists. In India, crop raiding by rhesus macaques has been identified as the main cause of conflict. In urban areas, rhesus macaques damage property and injure people in house raids to access food and provisions; in agricultural areas, they cause financial losses to farmers due to crop depredation. The estimated extent of crop damages in Himachal Pradesh ranges from 10–100% to 40–80% of all crop losses. The financial implications of such damage is estimated at approximately USD$200,000 in agriculture and USD$150,000 in horticulture. Quantification of crop and financial loses is challenging. Farmers&#x27; negative views of macaques may cause them to perceive higher than actual losses. This has led to harsh actions against rhesus macaque communities. Other factors in rhesus perception include economic status, farmer economic stability, cultural attitudes towards the given species and the frequency and intensity of wildlife conflicts. All of the above have resulted in changes in conservation and management with legal rhesus macaque culling issued in 2010.

Human-macaque conflict is also occurring in China, specifically in the area of Longyang District, Baoshan City, Yunnan Province. The peak period of conflict occurs from August–October. Factors associated with accessibility and availability of food and shelter appear to be the key drivers of human-macaque conflict, with an overall increase between the years of 2012 and 2021.

One key factor of conflict that directly affects the human-macaque relationship is visibility. Visibility of rhesus macaques in agroecosystem-dominated areas largely impacts conflict between humans and rhesus macaques. The conspicuous presence of rhesus macaques in and around farms results in farmers believing that macaques cause heavy crop depredations which, in turn, have led to negative perceptions and actions against the species. Whereas visibility in urban areas can result in a positive relationship, areas include around temples, and tourist areas where their dietary needs are largely met by food provisioning.  

Towards the end of March 2018, it was reported that a monkey had entered a house in the village of Talabasta, Odisha, India and kidnapped a baby. The baby was later found dead in a well. Though monkeys are known to attack people, enter homes and damage property, this reported behaviour was unusual.

=== Population management tools ===
Crop-raiding is seen as one of the most important behaviours to change to reduce conflicts. One example is the implementation of guards in agricultural settings to chase off intruding monkeys using dogs, slingshots, and firecrackers. This method is non-lethal and can alter behavioural patterns of crop-raiding monkeys. Another strategy that farmers can employ is to plant alternative, buffer crops which are unattractive to monkeys in high-conflict zones, such as along the edges of macaque habitats. In urban settings, planting food trees within city periphery and country parks aim to discourage macaques from entering nearby residential areas for food.

In areas of tourism, human behaviour change is necessary to prevent conflict. One method is to introduce public education programs as well as restrict visitors to specific viewing platforms, with the goal to minimize physical proximity. An important aspect is enforcing no feed regulations that only allow provisioning by trained staff at scheduled times. Regulating visitor behaviours that provoke aggressive responses from macaques, including noise regulation, greatly benefits conflict reduction. Replacing food-conditioned behaviours established by human visitors and further human education will greatly aid in returning co-existence between rhesus macaques and humans.

Another method of population management is translocation. Translocation of problem macaques in urban rhesus communities in India has been employed as a non-lethal solution to human–macaque conflicts. Translocation can be seen as a short-term fix, as macaques may return or other rhesus groups may take their place. Translocation is also hampered by a lack of suitable alternate locations. 

Another tool of population management is sterilisation and/or contraceptive programmes. Fertility control looks to be a feasible management tool for reducing human–macaque conflict because it avoids the extermination of the animals and avoids costs and problems associated with translocation. Although there is potential for sterilization and general fertility control to be positive, there is limited research and understanding of the long-term effects of sterilization programs and its effectiveness.

== In science ==

The rhesus macaque is well known to science. Due to its relatively easy upkeep in captivity, wide availability, and closeness to humans anatomically and physiologically, it has been used extensively in medical and biological research on human and animal health-related topics. It has given its name to the Rh factor, one of the elements of a person&#x27;s blood group, by the discoverers of the factor, Karl Landsteiner and Alexander Wiener. The rhesus macaque was also used in the well-known experiments on maternal deprivation carried out in the 1950s by controversial comparative psychologist Harry Harlow. Other medical breakthroughs facilitated by the use of the rhesus macaque include:
* development of the rabies, smallpox, and polio vaccines
* creation of drugs to manage HIV/AIDS
* understanding of the female reproductive cycle and development of the embryo and the propagation of embryonic stem cells.

The U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force, and NASA launched rhesus macaques into outer space during the 1950s and 1960s, and the Soviet/Russian space program launched them into space as recently as 1997 on the Bion missions. Albert II became the first primate and first mammal in space during a U.S. V-2 rocket suborbital flight on 14 June 1949, and died on impact when a parachute failed.

Another rhesus monkey, Able, was launched on a suborbital spaceflight in 1959, and was among the first living beings (along with Miss Baker, a squirrel monkey on the same mission) to travel in space and return alive.

On 25 October 1999, the rhesus macaque became the first cloned primate with the birth of Tetra. January 2001 had the birth of ANDi, the first transgenic primate; ANDi carries foreign genes originally from a jellyfish.

Though most studies of the rhesus macaque are from various locations in northern India, some knowledge of the natural behavior of the species comes from studies carried out on a colony established by the Caribbean Primate Research Center of the University of Puerto Rico on the island of Cayo Santiago, off Puerto Rico, where approximately 1800 of the monkeys live. No predators are on the island, and humans are not permitted to land except as part of the research programmes. The colony is provisioned to some extent, but about half of its food comes from natural foraging.

Rhesus macaques, like many macaques, carry the herpes B virus. This virus does not typically harm the monkey, but is very dangerous to humans in the rare event that it jumps species, for example in the 1997 death of Yerkes National Primate Research Center researcher Elizabeth Griffin.

=== Genome sequencing ===
Work on the genome of the rhesus macaque was completed in 2007, making the species the second nonhuman primate whose genome was sequenced. Humans and macaques apparently share about 93% of their DNA sequence and shared a common ancestor roughly 25 million years ago. The rhesus macaque has 21 pairs of chromosomes.

Comparison of rhesus macaques, chimpanzees, and humans revealed the structure of ancestral primate genomes, positive selection pressure and lineage-specific expansions, and contractions of gene families. &quot;The goal is to reconstruct the history of every gene in the human genome,&quot; said Evan Eichler, University of Washington, Seattle. DNA from different branches of the primate tree will allow us &quot;to trace back the evolutionary changes that occurred at various time points, leading from the common ancestors of the primate clade to &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;,&quot; said Bruce Lahn, University of Chicago.

After the human and chimpanzee genomes were sequenced and compared, it was usually impossible to tell whether differences were the result of the human or chimpanzee gene changing from the common ancestor. After the rhesus macaque genome was sequenced, three genes could be compared. If two genes were the same, they were presumed to be the original gene.

The chimpanzee and human genome diverged 6 million years ago. They have 98% identity and many conserved regulatory regions. Comparing the macaque and human genomes, further identified evolutionary pressure and gene function. Like the chimpanzee, changes were on the level of gene rearrangements rather than single mutations. Frequent insertions, deletions, changes in the order and number of genes, and segmental duplications near gaps, centromeres and telomeres occurred. So, macaque, chimpanzee, and human chromosomes are mosaics of each other.

Some normal gene sequences in healthy macaques and chimpanzees cause profound disease in humans. For example, the normal sequence of phenylalanine hydroxylase in macaques and chimpanzees is the mutated sequence responsible for phenylketonuria in humans. So, humans must have been under evolutionary pressure to adopt a different mechanism. Some gene families are conserved or under evolutionary pressure and expansion in all three primate species, while some are under expansion uniquely in human, chimpanzee, or macaque. For example, cholesterol pathways are conserved in all three species (and other primate species). In all three species, immune response genes are under positive selection, and genes of T cell-mediated immunity, signal transduction, cell adhesion, and membrane proteins generally. Genes for keratin, which produce hair shafts, were rapidly evolving in all three species, possibly because of climate change or mate selection. The X chromosome has three times more rearrangements than other chromosomes. The macaque gained 1,358 genes by duplication. Triangulation of human, chimpanzee, and macaque sequences showed expansion of gene families in each species.

The &quot;PKFP&quot; gene, important in sugar (fructose) metabolism, is expanded in macaques, possibly because of their high-fruit diet. So are genes for the olfactory receptor, cytochrome P450 (which degrades toxins), and CCL3L1-CCL4 (associated in humans with HIV susceptibility). Immune genes are expanded in macaques, relative to all four great ape species. The macaque genome has 33 major histocompatibility genes, three times those of human. This has clinical significance because the macaque is used as an experimental model of the human immune system.

In humans, the preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma (PRAME) gene family is expanded. It is actively expressed in cancers, but normally is testis-specific, possibly involved in spermatogenesis. The PRAME family has 26 members on human chromosome 1. In the macaque, it has eight, and has been very simple and stable for millions of years. The PRAME family arose in translocations in the common mouse-primate ancestor 85 million years ago, and is expanded on mouse chromosome 4.

DNA microarrays are used in macaque research. For example, Michael Katze of University of Washington, Seattle, infected macaques with 1918 and modern influenzas. The DNA microarray showed the macaque genomic response to human influenza on a cellular level in each tissue. Both viruses stimulated innate immune system inflammation, but the 1918 flu stimulated stronger and more persistent inflammation, causing extensive tissue damage, and it did not stimulate the interferon-1 pathway. The DNA response showed a transition from innate to adaptive immune response over seven days.

The full sequence and annotation of the macaque genome is available on the Ensembl genome browser.

== Conservation status ==
The rhesus macaque is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List and estimated to exist in large numbers; it is tolerant of a broad range of habitats, including urban environments. It has the largest natural range of any non-human primate. The Thai population is locally threatened. In addition to habitat destruction and agricultural encroachment, pet releases of the different species into existing troops are diluting the gene pool and putting its genetic integrity at risk. Despite the wealth of information on its ecology and behaviour, little attention has been paid to its demography or population status, which can pose a risk for future Rhesus macaque populations. The extension of its distributional limits by approximately in southeast India caused population stress on other species. This range extension has been caused by human intervention tactics whereby village translocation occurs from urban conflict ridden areas.

<doc id="423946" wikidata="Q766136" url="?curid=423946" title="Battle of Harlaw">
<text>The Battle of Harlaw () was a Scottish clan battle fought on 24 July 1411 just north of Inverurie in Aberdeenshire. It was one of a series of battles fought during the Middle Ages between the barons of northeast Scotland and those from the west coast.

The battle was part of a series of battles fought to resolve competing claims to the Earldom of Ross, a large region of northern Scotland. Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany, Regent of Scotland, had taken control of the earldom ostensibly as guardian of his granddaughter Euphemia Leslie, but in truth, though Donald of Islay, Lord of the Isles had the superior claim, Albany wanted Ross for his younger son, John. Donald, Lord of the Isles, had married Euphemia&#x27;s aunt Mariota. Donald therefore invaded Ross with the intention of seizing the earldom by force and preventing Albany from taking all of Scotland.

The nearest contemporary record of the battle is found in the Irish Annals of Connacht, where under the year 1411, it is stated, &quot;Mac Domnaill of Scotland won a great victory over the Galls of Scotland&quot;. The 2011 article by Iain G. MacDonald, &quot;Donald of the Isles and the Earldom of Ross: West-Highland Perspectives on the Battle of Harlaw&quot;, also cites sources recording the victory.

==Background==
During the Early Middle Ages, the territory of what later became Scotland was divided between the Gaelic kingdoms of Dál Riata on the western seaboard and Alba in the south-east, and Pictish kingdoms in the northeast of which Fortriu was the most important. Besides these there were the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Bernicia, later part of Northumbria, and the Brythonic Kingdom of Cumbria. Viking influence increased in the west, with the Norse-Gaels that became Lords of the Isles taking control of much of Dál Riata in 1156. The Gaels of Alba acquired Brythonic elements from the conquest of the Kingdom of Strathclyde in the 11th century and increasingly absorbed Norman-French and Anglo-Saxon culture, influences which also spread to the Pictish areas of the northeast. The lands of Fortriu became part of the Province of Moray, which was conquered by Alba in 1130 and fragmented into territories that were semi-independent of the king in Edinburgh.
There was a long history of conflicts between the Moray gentry and the clans of the West Coast, but some historians present Harlaw as a clash between the Scottish Highlands and Lowlands, or between Celt and Teuton. John Hill Burton (1809–1881) claimed that in Lowland Scotland Harlaw &quot;was felt as a more memorable deliverance even than that of Bannockburn. What it was to be subject to England the country knew and disliked; to be subdued by their savage enemies of the mountains opened to them sources of terror of unknown character and extent&quot;. However Sir Robert Rait (1874–1936) detected no racial antipathy in the two contemporary accounts of the &quot;Scotichronicon&quot; and the Book of Pluscarden, and viewed Harlaw not as a conflict between races, but between two groups of Scots of which one spoke Scots and the other Gaelic. Rait mentions Buchanan&#x27;s view that it was a raid for plunder.

==Claims on the Earldom of Ross==
The Earldom of Ross was a vast territory reaching from Skye to Ross and Inverness-shire, with superiority over the outlying lands of Nairn and Aberdeenshire. In 1370 Uilleam (William), Earl of Ross received a charter from King David II, confirming his right to the title and directing that in the absence of male heirs, the entirety of the earldom, titles and lands would fall to &quot;the elder daughter always&quot; without division. Uilleam died in 1372 without a male heir, and the title passed to his daughter Euphemia. By her first husband Sir Walter Leslie, Euphemia had two children – Alexander Leslie and Mariota (anglicised as Margaret or Mary). After Walter&#x27;s death, Euphemia married Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan (the &quot;Wolf of Badenoch&quot;) in 1382, giving the Stewarts control of the earldom. However, in 1392 the Pope annulled the marriage and Ross was returned to Euphemia as Countess of Ross. The Wolf of Badenoch had long been living with his mistress Mairead inghean Eachainn with whom he had a number of children, including Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar. Euphemia died in 1394 and her son Alexander Leslie inherited the title.

Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany had taken effective control of mainland Scotland towards the end of the reign of his father Robert II; his power increased during the reign (1390–1406) of his ineffective elder brother Robert III. Albany&#x27;s daughter Isabel Stewart married Alexander Leslie before 1398 and their only child was a sickly daughter, also called Euphemia. According to the Calendar of Fearn, Leslie died on 8 May 1402, whilst his daughter was still a minor. Albany claimed wardship of Euphemia, and planned to take over Ross. After the capture by the English of Robert III&#x27;s heir James and Robert&#x27;s death soon afterwards in April 1406, Albany was confirmed as regent; Albany continued to govern Scotland until his death in September 1420.

Meanwhile, Donald (Domhnall), Lord of the Isles claimed the earldom of Ross through his marriage to Euphemia&#x27;s aunt, Mariota, the oldest living female descendant of Uilleam. He also signed an alliance with Henry IV of England on 16 September 1405, which was renewed on 8 May 1408. 

According to Skene, Euphemia became a nun before the battle.

==Invasion and the preceding Battle of Dingwall==
It took Donald time to ready his assault, but in 1411 he assembled his forces at Ardtornish Castle on the Sound of Mull and invaded Ross. He met no opposition until &quot;a severe conflict&quot; at Dingwall, seat of the Earls of Ross, where, at the Battle of Dingwall, he fought a large body of men of the Clan Mackay from &quot;Strathnaver&quot;. Their leader Angus Du Mackay, 7th of Strathnaver was captured and his brother Rory-Gald was killed along with &quot;the greater part of his men&quot;; Donald then captured and garrisoned Dingwall Castle. He imprisoned Mackay in a castle on the west coast and after the battle made peace with him, giving Angus his sister, Elizabeth, in marriage. 

Donald assembled his army at Inverness, and summoned all the fighting men in Boyne and Enzie (northern Banffshire between the Rivers Deveron and Spey) to join his army. He then swept through Moray meeting little or no resistance. He then turned south-east, following roughly the route of the modern A96 road although the main road ran north of the River Urie, not south as it does today. Donald&#x27;s men committed &quot;great excesses&quot; in Strathbogie and the Garioch, which belonged to Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar. Finally the Islesmen and their Highlander allies came to Bennachie, the last hill of the Grampians before the coastal plain between Inverurie and Aberdeen. Donald was now within of Aberdeen burgh. On 23 July 1411, he set up camp just north of Inverurie, on high ground 2 km northwest of the bridge over the River Urie.

The Earl of Mar, who had made a pact with Albany to lead an army for him, had plenty of warning of their advance, and had assembled a force from among the gentry of Buchan, Angus and the Mearns (Kincardineshire). The Irvings, Maules, Moray, Straitons, Lesleys, Stirlings and Lovels were led by their respective clan chiefs. Mar gathered his troops at Inverurie, a strategic town on the Inverness-Aberdeen road, and on the morning of 24 July marched northwest to meet Donald.

==Battle==
According to the &quot;Scotichronicon&quot;, the two armies joined battle on the eve of the feast of St James – 24 July 1411. The same source and many others put Donald&#x27;s army at 10,000 Islanders, Highland clans with marriage bloodlines as well as men of Ross, They were armed with swords, bows and axes, short knives, and round targe shields. 

Tradition has it that they faced a force numbering between 1,000 and 2,000 men; with significant numbers of knights. As an example, one Sir Gilbert de Greenlaw died at Harlaw and his tombstone at Kinkell Church gives an idea of how Mar&#x27;s knights were equipped. Sir Gilbert carried a hand and a half sword and wore an open-faced bascinet helmet with a mail-reinforced arming doublet beneath plate armour. Mar&#x27;s men also carried spears, maces, and battle axes. Tradition has it that the black armour in the entrance hall of Aberdeen Town House belonged to Robert Davidson, Provost of Aberdeen, who died in the battle along with most of the city&#x27;s burgesses.

On spotting the Islesmen and their Highlander allies, Mar organised his force into battle array, with the main army behind a small advance guard of men-at-arms under Sir James Scrymgeour (Constable of Dundee, the hereditary standard-bearer of Scotland) and Sir Alexander Ogilvie of Auchterhouse (Sheriff of Angus). He probably split the army into three, with the knights as a cavalry reserve (some say they led the battle) and the infantry arranged in schiltrons, close-packed arrays of spearmen. There is no mention of significant numbers of archers. The Islanders and their Highlander allies were arranged in the traditional cuneiform or wedge shape, with Hector MacLean commanding the right wing and Callum Beg Macintosh, chief of the Clan Mackintosh and the confederation of Clan Chattan, on the left. Donald, Lord of the Isles commanded the centre of the army himself, backed by the MacLeods of Harris and MacLeods of Lewis, and his younger brother, John Mór Tanister, commanded the reserve, backed by the Mackenzies and Camerons. At first, the clansmen launched themselves at Scrymgeour&#x27;s men, but failed to make much impression on the armoured column and many were slain. However, every wave that was repulsed, was replaced by fresh men. Mar led his knights into the main body of Donald&#x27;s army and became cut off. They brought down the knights&#x27; warhorses and then used their dirks to finish off the riders.

By nightfall, the ballads claim that 600 of Mar&#x27;s men were dead, including Ogilvie and his son, Scrymgeour, Sir Robert Maule, Sir Thomas Morrow (Murray), William Abernethy, Alexander Straiton of Lauriston, James Lovel, Alexander Stirling, and Sir Alexander Irvine of Drum; according to Maclean history the latter duelled with Hector Maclean until both were dead. Many families lost every male in their house; Lesley of Balquhain died with six of his sons. 

Donald lost 900 men, a much smaller proportion of his total force (he still had 9100 men on the field), but including one of his commanders (Hector Maclean). In the history of the Mackintoshes, chiefs of the Chattan Federation, it is recorded that &quot;Mackintosh mourned the loss of so many of his friends and people, especially of Clan Vean&quot; (Clan MacBean). By contrast, a MacDonald Seanchaí stated that just &quot;two or three gentlemen of the name Munroe&quot; were killed in the battle and that they were part of the Lord of the Isles&#x27; host. The same 17th century manuscript states that the &quot;son of Macquarry of Ulva&quot; and &quot;two gentlemen of the name Cameron&quot; were also killed on the side of Donald, Lord of the Isles.

Wounded and too feeble to retreat, Mar and his surviving men camped on the battlefield, expecting combat to resume in the morning. At dawn they found that Donald had withdrawn during the night, going first to Ross and then back to the Isles. Donald clearly had the victory but decided not to press further. The McKean Historical Notes relating to the MacIain MacDonalds of Ardnamurchan, compiled by Fred G. McKean, 1906, at p. 38, refers to the Annals of the Old Abbey of Inis-Macreen and mentions the &quot;great victory&quot; of the Macdonald of Scotland in 1411.

==Aftermath==
Many of those who died were buried at Kinkell Church south of Inverurie. The heirs of the slain Scots were exempt from death duties in the same way as heirs of those who died fighting the English. 

Suspecting that Donald had merely fallen back to rest and reinforce his troops, Albany collected an army and marched on Dingwall, seizing the castle and regaining control of Ross. In mid-1412 he followed up with a three-pronged attack on Donald&#x27;s possessions, forcing Donald to surrender his claim on Ross, become a vassal of the Scottish crown and give up hostages against his future good behaviour. The treaty was signed at Polgilbe/Polgillip (Loch Gilp), an inlet of Loch Fyne in Argyll.

After Harlaw, the Earl of Mar &quot;ruled with acceptance nearly all the north of the country beyond the Mounth&quot; according to the &quot;Scotichronicon&quot;. He entered into an &quot;uneasy alliance&quot; with his uncle Albany, but the ruin of Albany&#x27;s heirs left Mar in control of the north. 

It was proposed on 3 June 1415 that Euphemia should marry Thomas Dunbar, 3rd (6th) Earl of Moray but the papal commission would not have arrived before she surrendered her land and titles (possibly under compulsion) to Albany&#x27;s son the Earl of Buchan on 12 June 1415, after which she appears to have entered a nunnery. Buchan was killed at the Battle of Verneuil in 1424. In 1424, when James I returned to Scotland from his imprisonment in England, he had all of Albany&#x27;s heirs, the Albany Stewarts, executed. Mariota claimed the earldom of Ross and the Lordship of the Isles once more, and James I awarded it to her in 1424. The title remained with the family for much of the 15th century. Donald&#x27;s son Alexander succeeded to the title upon Mariota&#x27;s death in 1429. He attempted an invasion of Ross in 1429 which led to his defeat and capture by Mar at the Battle of Lochaber. 

In turn Mar suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of Donald&#x27;s nephew Donald Balloch, at the Battle of Inverlochy. The resulting power vacuum allowed Alexander to occupy Inverness and perhaps consider himself Earl of Ross by 1437; the title was officially confirmed by the new regent, the Earl of Douglas, after the death of James I that year.

==Commemoration and archaeology==
The battle is remembered as &quot;one of the hardest fought that ever took place on Scottish soil&quot;; the fighting was so fierce that the battle went down in history as &quot;Red (Reid) Harlaw&quot;. The battle is commemorated in a march, &quot;The Battle of Harlaw&quot;, and in ballads such as Child ballad 163. Maidment has a different ballad which apparently shares the same tune, but he is sceptical of its antiquity. Sir Walter Scott mentions Harlaw in his 1816 novel &quot;The Antiquary&quot;, particularly in Elspeth&#x27;s ballad in Chapter 40.

Tradition has it that Mar founded Chapel of Garioch after the battle, to celebrate masses for the souls of the fallen. In 1911, Aberdeen Town Council erected the Harlaw Monument, located to the north of the town of Inverurie, to the memory of Provost Robert Davidson and the burgesses of Aberdeen who died in the battle. Designed by William Kelly and located to the south of Harlaw House, the granite monument is hexagonal and tall. There were once several cairns in the area that were traditionally associated with the battle, but little remains of them now – Drum&#x27;s Cairn, Provost Davidson&#x27;s Cairn, Donald&#x27;s Tomb and the Liggars Stane. Twelve human skeletons were uncovered northeast of Harlaw House in 1837. Although there have been several discoveries of prehistoric artefacts, such as stone axeheads and a flint core, no artefacts directly attributable to the battle have been recorded. The battlefield has been inventoried and protected by Historic Scotland under the Historic Environment (Amendment) Act 2011.

<text>The Battle of Badr ( (Urdu transliteration: &quot;Ghazwah-i-Badr&quot;), also referred to as The Day of the Criterion (, ) in the Qur&#x27;an and by Muslims, was fought on 13 March 624 CE (17 Ramadan, 2 AH), near the present-day city of Badr, Al Madinah Province in Saudi Arabia. Muhammad, commanding an army of his Sahaba, defeated an army of the Quraysh led by Amr ibn Hishām, better known among Muslims as Abu Jahl. The battle marked the beginning of the six-year war between Muhammad and his tribe. Prior to the battle, the Muslims and the Meccans had fought several smaller skirmishes in late 623 and early 624.

Muhammad took keen interest in capturing Meccan caravans after his migration to Medina, seeing it as repayment for his people, the Muhajirun. A few days before the battle, when he learnt of a Makkan caravan returning from the Levant led by Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, Muhammad gathered a small expeditionary force to capture it. Abu Sufyan, learning of the Muslim plan to ambush his caravan, changed course and took a longer route away from Muhammad&#x27;s base at Medina and sent a messenger to Mecca, asking for help. Amr Bin Hisham commanded an army nearly one-thousand strong, approaching Badr and encamping at the sand dune al-&#x27;Udwatul Quswa.

Badr was the first large-scale engagement between the Muslims and Quraysh Meccans. Advancing from the north, the Muslims faced the Meccans. The battle began with duels between the warriors on both sides, following which the Meccans charged upon the Muslims under a cover of arrows. The Muslims countered their charge and broke the Meccan lines, killing several important Quraishi leaders including Abu Jahl and Umayyah ibn Khalaf.

The Muslim victory strengthened Muhammad&#x27;s position; The Medinese eagerly joined his future expeditions and tribes outside Medina openly allied with Muhammad. The battle has been passed down in Islamic history as a decisive victory attributable to divine intervention, and by other sources to the strategic prowess of Muhammad.

==Background==

After the Hijra (migration to Medina) in 622 CE, the population of Medina chose Muhammad to be the leader of the community. Muhammad&#x27;s followers decided to raid the caravans of the Meccans as they passed by Medina. This decision was taken in response to the Meccans persecution of the Muslims and their forceful seizing of Muslim land and property following the Hijra.

In early 624, a caravan of the Quraysh led by Abu Sufyan ibn Harb carrying wealth and goods from the Levant (possibly Gaza) was returning to Mecca. It was carrying merchandise worth 50,000 dinars and guarded by 70 men. The caravan was extraordinarily large, possibly because several smaller caravans may have grouped together for safety. All the leading Meccan financiers had a share in this trading venture, and thus had a strong interest in it returning.

Muhammad learned of the caravan and decided to intercept it for two reasons. First, was the continuation of the policy to recover wealth from the Quraysh, as the Quraysh had confiscated Muslims&#x27; properties in Mecca after the hijrah. Secondly, a successful attack would impress the Meccans and could act as a deterrent against a future attack on Medina.

Abu Sufyan sent word to Mecca that the caravan was in danger, asking for reinforcements to cover the caravan as it passed by Medina. Traditional Muslim sources write that Abu Sufyan&#x27;s spies had informed him of Muslim preparations to attack, a view accepted by Ramadan. But Watt writes given that it took the Meccan army a week to get to Badr, Abu Sufyan must have sent his request before the Muslim preparations began. Watt points out Abu Sufyan was &quot;one of the most astute men in Mecca&quot; and must have anticipated the Muslim attack.

Muhammad had gathered a small expeditionary force of around 300 men to intercept the caravan. Abu Sufyan&#x27;s spies informed him of the Muslims&#x27; plot to ambush his caravan. Fearing the loss of wealth that was imminent, Abu Sufyan sent the messenger Damdam bin &#x27;Amr al-Ghifari to the Quraish. Damdam, upon his arrival at the Ka&#x27;bah, cut off the nose and ears of his camel, turned its saddle upside down, tore off his shirt and cried:
&quot;O Quraish! Your merchandise! It is with Abu Sufyan. The caravan is being intercepted by Muhammad and his companions. I cannot say what would have happened to them. Help! Help!&quot;Abu Sufyan had rerouted his caravan toward the Red Sea and escaped the Muslim threat by Damdam&#x27;s arrival at Mecca.

== Battlefield ==

The valley of Badr is surrounded by two large sand dunes to the east, called &quot;al-&#x27;Udwatud Dunya&quot; (the near side of the valley) and &quot;al-&#x27;Udwatul Quswa&quot; (the far side of the valley). The Qur&#x27;an speaks of these two in Surah 8, verse 42. The west of the valley was covered by the al-Asfal Mountain (&quot;Jabal Al-Asfal&quot;) with an opening between it and another hill in the northwest.

Between al-&#x27;Udwatud Dunya and al-&#x27;Udwatul Quswa was an opening, which was the primary route to Medina. Muhammad and his army did not approach the battlefield from here, they came from the north, as they were originally planning to target the caravan, which was moving from the Levant in the north, to Mecca in the south. Between al-&#x27;Udwatul Quswa and the hill covering the southern part of the battlefield was another opening, which was the primary route from Mecca.

The Quraish had encamped in the south-eastern portion of the valley near the road to Mecca, while Muhammad and his army had encamped in some date-palms in the north. They had taken a well near the center of the western margin of al-&#x27;Udwatul Dunya and destroyed the other wells near the road to Medina to prevent the Makkans from getting any water. Another well situated at the end of the road to Mecca was later filled with the bodies of the dead Makkans.

=== Rainfall ===
On the night of 11 March (15 Ramadan), it had rained over the battlefield and the surrounding region. Muslims believe this was a blessing from Allah for the believers and a curse for the disbelievers, who suffered hardship in trying to climb the muddy slope.

== Battle ==

=== Muslim march to Badr ===
Muhammad was able to gather an army of 313–317 men. Sources vary upon the exact number, but the generally accepted number is 313. This army consisted of 82 Muhajirun, 61 men from the &#x27;Aws and 170 men from the Khazraj. They were not well-equipped for a major conflict nor prepared. They only had two horses, and those belonged to Zubayr ibn al-Awwam and al-Miqdad ibn &#x27;Amr. The entire army had 70 camels, meaning that they had one camel for two to three men to ride alternatively. Muhammad shared a camel with &#x27;Ali ibn Abu Talib and Marthad ibn Abi Marthad al-Ghanawi. The guardianship and administration of Medina was entrusted with Ibn Umm Maktum, but later with Abu Lubaba ibn &#x27;Abd al-Mundhir. Muhammad handed a white standard to Mus‘ab ibn &#x27;Umair al-Qurashi al-&#x27;Abdari. The army was divided into two battalions: one of the 82 Muhajirun and the other of the 231 Ansar. The flag of the Muhajirun was carried by &#x27;Ali ibn Abu Talib, while that of the Ansar was carried by Sa&#x27;d ibn Mu&#x27;adh. az-Zubayr commanded the right flank, while al-Miqdad commanded the left. And the rear of the army was commanded by Qays bin Abi Sa&#x27;sa&#x27;ah.

With Muhammad in the lead, the army marched out along the main road to Mecca, from the north. At Safra&#x27;, he dispatched Basbas al-Juhani and &#x27;Adi al-Juhani to scout for the Quraish. The future Caliph Uthman stayed behind to care of his sick wife Ruqayyah, the daughter of Muhammad, who later died from illness. Salman al-Farsi also could not join the battle, as he was still not a free man.

=== Qurayshi advance toward Badr ===
All of the clans of the Quraish except the Banu &#x27;Adi quickly assembled an excited army of around 1300 men, 100 horses and a large number of camels. Moving swiftly towards Badr, they passed the valleys of &#x27;Usfan, Qadid and al-Juhfah. At al-Juhfah, another messenger from Abu Sufyan informed them of the safety of their merchandise and wealth. Upon receiving this message, the Makkan army expressed delight and showed a desire to return home. Abu Jahl was not interested in returning and insisted on proceeding to Badr, and holding a feast there to show the Muslims and the surrounding tribes that they were superior. Despite Abu Jahl&#x27;s threat and insistence, the Banu Zahrah, numbering around 300, broke away from the army and returned to Mecca, on the advice of Al-Akhnas ibn Shurayq. Muhammad&#x27;s clan, the Banu Hashim, also attempted to break away but were threatened by Abu Jahl to stay. Many of the Qurayshi nobles, including Abu Jahl, al-Walid ibn &#x27;Utbah, &#x27;Utbah ibn Rabi&#x27;ah, and Umayyah ibn Khalaf, joined the Meccan army. Their reasons varied: some were out to protect their financial interests in the caravan; others wanted to avenge Ibn al-Hadrami, a guard killed in one of the caravan ambushes at Nakhlah; finally, a few must have wanted to take part in what was expected to be an easy victory against the Muslims. Amr ibn Hishām is described as shaming Umayyah ibn Khalaf into joining the expedition.

=== Plans of action ===

==== Muslim council near Badr ====
Muhammad held a council of war to review the situation and decide on a plan-of-action. According to some Muslim scholars, the following verses of Al Anfal, Q8:5-6, were revealed in lieu of some Muslims fearing the encounter. Abu Bakr was the first to speak at the meeting and he reassured Muhammad. &#x27;Umar was next. Then, al-Miqdad ibn &#x27;Amr got up and said:&quot;O Messenger of Allah! Proceed where Allah directs you to, for we are with you. We will not say as the Children of Israel said to Musa: &quot;Go you and your Lord and fight and we will stay here;&quot; rather we shall say: &quot;Go you and your Lord and fight and we will fight along with you.&quot; By Allah! If you were to take us to Birk al-Ghimad, we will still fight resolutely with you against its defenders until you gained it.&quot;Muhammad then praised him and supplicated for him, but the three who had spoken were of the Muhajirun, who only constituted around one-third of the Muslim men in Medina. Muhammad wanted the opinion of the Ansar, who were not committed to fighting beyond their territories in the Pledges of &#x27;Aqabah. Muhammad then indirectly asked the Ansar to speak, which Sa&#x27;d ibn Mu&#x27;adh understood and asked for permission to speak. Muhammad immediately gave him permission to speak and Sa&#x27;d said:
&quot;O Prophet of Allah! We believe in you and we bear witness to what you have brought is the Truth. We give you our firm pledge of obedience and sacrifice. We will obey you most willingly in whatever you command us, and by Allah, Who has sent you with the Truth, if you were to ask us to throw ourselves into the sea, we will do that most readily and not a man of us will stay behind. We do not deny the idea of encounter with the enemy. We are experienced in war and we are trustworthy in control. We hope that Allah will show you through our hands those deeds of bravery which will please your eyes. Kindly lead us to the battlefield in the Name of Allah.&quot;Muhammad, impressed with his loyalty and spirit of sacrifice, ordered the march towards Badr to continue.

====Muslim plan of action====
By Sunday, 11 March (15 Ramadan), both armies were about a day&#x27;s march from Badr. Muhammad and Abu Bakr had conducted a scouting operation and managed to locate the camp of the Quraish. They came across an old bedouin nearby from whom they managed to find out the exact strength of their army and their location. In the evening, Muhammad dispatched &#x27;Ali, az-Zubayr and Sa&#x27;d ibn Abi Waqqas to scout for the Makkans. They captured two Meccan water-bearers at the wells of Badr. Expecting them to say they were with the caravan, the Muslims were horrified to hear them say they were with the main Quraishi army. Unsatisfied with their answer, while Muhammad was praying, some of the Muslims beat the two boys into lying and Muhammad strictly condemned this action later. Muhammad then extracted the details of the Makkans from the boys. The next day Muhammad ordered a march to Badr and arrived before the Meccans.

When the Muslim army arrived from the east, Muhammad initially chose to encamp at the first well he encountered. al-Hubab ibn al-Mundhir, however, asked him if this choice was from divine instruction or Muhammad&#x27;s own opinion. When Muhammad responded in the latter, Hubab suggested that the Muslims occupy the well closest to the Quraishi army, and block off or destroy the other ones. Muhammad accepted this decision and the plan was carried out at midnight. Muhammad had also given strict orders to not begin an attack without his sole permission.

Muhammad spent the whole night of 12 March (16 Ramadan) praying near a tree. The Muslim army enjoyed a refreshing night of sleep, again believed by Muslims, to be a blessing from Allah.

====Meccan plan of action====
While little is known about the progress of the Quraishi army from the time it left Mecca until its arrival just outside Badr, several things are worth noting: although many Arab armies brought their women and children along on campaigns both to motivate and care for the men, the Meccan army did not. The Quraish apparently made little or no effort to contact the many allies they had scattered throughout the Hejaz. Both facts suggest the Quraish lacked the time to prepare for a proper campaign in their haste to protect the caravan. Besides, it is believed they expected an easy victory.

Since Muhammad&#x27;s army had either destroyed or taken all the wells in the city, a few Makkans approached the well controlled by Muslims to draw out water. All were shot except Hakim ibn Hizam, who later accepted Islam. At midnight on 13 March (17 Ramadan), the Quraish broke camp and marched into the valley of Badr. &#x27;Umayr ibn Wahb al-Jumahi made a survey of the Muslim position and reported 300 men keen on fighting to the last man. After another scouting mission, he reported that neither were the Muslims going to be reinforced, nor were they planning any ambushes. This further demoralized the Quraish, as Arab battles were traditionally low-casualty affairs, and set off another round of bickering among the Quraishi leadership. However, according to Arab traditions Amr ibn Hishām quashed the remaining dissent by appealing to the Quraishis&#x27; sense of honor and demanding that they fulfill their blood vengeance.

===Duels===
The battle began with al-Aswad bin &#x27;Abdul-Asad al-Makhzumi, one of the men from Abu Jahl&#x27;s clan, the Banu Makhzum, swearing that he would drink from the well of the Muslims or otherwise destroy it or die for it. In response to his cries, Hamza ibn &#x27;Abdul-Muttalib, one of Muhammad&#x27;s uncles, came out and they began fighting in a duel. Hamza struck al-Aswad&#x27;s leg before dealing him another blow that killed him. Seeing this, three men protected by armor and shields, Utbah ibn Rabi&#x27;ah, alongside his brother, Shaybah ibn Rabi&#x27;ah and son, al-Walid ibn &#x27;Utbah, emerged from the Makkan ranks. Three of the Madani Ansar emerged from the Muslim ranks, only to be shouted back by the Meccans, who were nervous about starting any unnecessary feuds and only wanted to fight the Muhajirun, keeping the dispute within the tribe. So Hamza approached and called on Ubaydah ibn al-Harith and &#x27;Ali ibn Abu Talib to join him. The first two duels between &#x27;Ali and al-Walid and Hamza and Shaybah were quick with both managing to kill their opponents swiftly. After the fight between Ali and Walid, Hamza looked at &#x27;Ubaydah to find him seriously wounded. He then fell upon and killed Shaybah. Ali and Hamza then carried Ubaydah back into the Muslim lines. He died later due to a disease. A shower of arrows from both sides followed these duels and this was followed by several other duels, most of which were won by the Muslims. The Makkans now took the offensive and charged upon the Muslim lines.

=== Makkan charge and Muslim counter-attack ===
As the Makkans charged upon the Muslims, Muhammad kept asking Allah, stretching his hands toward the Qibla:&quot;O Allah! Should this group (of Muslims) be defeated today, You will no longer be worshipped.&quot;Muhammad kept reciting his prayer until his cloak fell off his shoulders, at which point Abu Bakr picked it up and put it back on his shoulders and said:&quot;O Prophet of Allah, you have cried out enough to your Lord. He will surely fulfil what He has promised you.&quot;Muhammad gave the order to carry out a counterattack against the enemy now, throwing a handful of pebbles at the Makkans in what was probably a traditional Arabian gesture while yelling &quot;Defaced be those faces!&quot; or &quot;Confusion seize their faces.&quot; The Muslim army yelled in reply, &quot;Yā manṣūr amit!&quot; meaning &quot;O thou whom God hath made victorious, slay!&quot; and rushed the Qurayshi lines. The Makkans, understrength and unenthusiastic about fighting, promptly broke and ran. Muslims attribute their fear of fighting and fleeing from the battlefield to divine intervention, with the Qur&#x27;an stating in Chapter 8, verse 12, that Allah inspired angels to strengthen those who have believed, and cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved. The battle itself only lasted a few hours and was over by early afternoon. The Qur&#x27;an describes the force of the Muslim attack in many verses, which refer to thousands of angels descending from Heaven at Badr to terrify the Quraish. It also describes how Iblis, the Leader of the Jinn, mentioned to have taken the form of Suraqa ibn Malik, fled the battlefield upon seeing the angels. Muslim sources take this account literally, and there are several ahadith where Muhammad discusses the Angel Jibreel and the role he played in the battle.

== Aftermath ==

===Imprisonment of captives and their ransom===
Three days after the battle, Muhammad left Badr for Medina. As far as the treatment of prisoners was concerned, Abu Bakr was of the opinion that they should be ransomed, since they were all of their own kin. &#x27;Umar argued against this, saying that there is no notion of blood relationships as far as Islam is concerned, and that all the prisoners should be executed, and that everyone should execute him who is closest to him by blood. &#x27;Ali should kill his brother &#x27;Aqeel ibn Abu Talib, Hamza ibn &#x27;Abdul-Muttalib should behead his brother &#x27;Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib, and that he himself would kill someone close to him. Muhammad accepted Abu Bakr&#x27;s suggestion to ransom the captives. Some 70 prisoners were taken captive and are noted to have been treated humanely, including a number of Quraysh leaders. Most of the prisoners were released upon payment of ransom and those who were literate were released on the condition that they teach ten persons how to read and write and this teaching was to count as their ransom.

William Muir wrote of this period:

===Casualties===
Despite scholars estimating Meccan casualties at around 70, only the names of the more prominent ones are known. However, the names of the 14 Muslims who were killed during the course of the war or later (due to injuries sustained during the war) are all known.

==== Meccan casualties ====

Well-known Meccans who were killed during the battle included Amr ibn Hishām, Umayyah ibn Khalaf, &#x27;Utbah ibn Rabi&#x27;ah, Shaybah ibn Rabi&#x27;ah, al-Walid ibn &#x27;Utbah, al-Aswad bin and &#x27;Abdul-Asad al-Makhzumi. Nadr ibn al-Harith and &#x27;Uqbah ibn Abū Mu‘ayṭ were also killed, though the circumstances of their deaths are unclear. According to some sources the last two were killed during fighting in the field of battle at Badr and subsequently buried in a pit, while Safiur Rahman al-Mubarakpuri writes that these two were taken as prisoners and subsequently executed by Ali.

=== Implications ===
The Battle of Badr was extremely influential in the rise of two men who determined the course of Arabian history in the next century. The first was Muhammad, who was transformed overnight from a Meccan outcast into the leader of a new community and city-state at Medina. Marshall Hodgson adds that Badr forced the other Arabs to &quot;regard the Muslims as challengers and potential inheritors to the prestige and the political role of the [Quraish].&quot; Shortly thereafter he expelled the Banu Qaynuqa, one of the Jewish tribes in Medina for assaulting a Muslim woman which led to their expulsion for breaking the peace treaty. The tribe is also known for having threatened Muhammad&#x27;s political position. At the same time &#x27;Abd Allah ibn Ubayy, Muhammad&#x27;s chief opponent in Medina, found his own position seriously weakened. He was only able to mount limited challenges to Muhammad.

The other major beneficiary of the Battle of Badr was Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, safely away from the battle leading the caravan. The death of Amr ibn Hisham, as well as many other Quraishi nobles, gave Abu Sufyan the opportunity, almost by default, to become chief of the Quraish. As a result, when Muhammad marched into Mecca six years later, it was Abu Sufyan who helped negotiate its peaceful surrender. Abu Sufyan subsequently became a high-ranking official in the Muslim Empire, and his son Mu&#x27;awiya later went on to found the Umayyad Caliphate.

Hamza had performed especially well during the battle of Badr, killing one of the leaders and a number of high-ranking officials of the Quraysh. In retaliation, the Quraysh put a bounty on his head. An assassin killed him at battle of Uhud and the Quraysh followed by publicly mutilating Hamza.

In later days, the battle of Badr became so significant that Ibn Ishaq included a complete name-by-name roster of the Muslim army in his biography of Muhammad. In many hadiths, veterans who fought at Badr are identified as such as a formality, and they may have even received a stipend in later years. The death of the last of the Badr veterans occurred during the First Fitna.

==Legacy==

In the Quran, the battle is referred to as Yawm al-Furqan (; ). The story of the Battle of Badr has been passed down in Islamic history throughout the centuries, before being combined in the multiple biographies of Muhammad that exist today. It is mentioned in the Quran, and all knowledge of the battle comes from traditional Islamic accounts, recorded and compiled sometime after the battle. There is little evidence beside these and there are no written descriptions of the battle prior to the 9th century, and as such, the historicity and authenticity of the battle are debated by contemporary historians.

&quot;Badr&quot; has become popular among Muslim armies and paramilitary organizations. &quot;Operation Badr&quot; was used to describe Egypt&#x27;s offensive in the 1973 Yom Kippur War as well as Pakistan&#x27;s actions in the 1999 Kargil War. Iranian offensive operations against Iraq in the late 1980s were also named after Badr. During the 2011 Libyan civil war, the rebel leadership stated that they selected the date of the assault on Tripoli to be the 20th of Ramadan, marking the anniversary of the Battle of Badr.

The Battle of Badr was featured in the 1976 film &quot;The Message&quot;, the 2004 animated movie &quot;&quot;, the 2012 TV series &quot;Omar&quot; and the 2015 animated movie &quot;.&quot;

<doc id="423953" wikidata="Q7239259" url="?curid=423953" title="Pre-qualification">
<text>In general, to pre-qualify is about passing or meeting an initial criteria or requirements before getting other opportunities opened up to such a person.

Pre-qualification is a process whereby a loan officer takes information from a borrower and makes a tentative assessment of how much the lending institution is willing to lend them.

==Basic process==
The borrower is typically asked for their social security number or another identifier, together with proof of their employment, income, and assets, which is weighed against the monthly payments being made on their current debts. This provides a general picture of their creditworthiness. Based on this initial information, a maximum loan amount will be determined according to a standard Debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Final approval of the loan will require a credit report from a credit bureau

===Mortgage===
In a mortgage context, pre-qualification denotes a process that has not yet been underwritten by the lending institution. Typically, subprime lenders will allow 50% DTI. Common monthly debts used for calculating DTI are mortgage (or new mortgage payment), auto payment(s), minimum credit card payment(s), student loans, and any other common monthly or revolving debt that is on the applicant&#x27;s credit bureau report. If a refinance is involved, monthly debts that are being consolidated are not taken into consideration, because they are built into the DTI by way of the new loan amount payment. 

Other factors included in determining the buyer&#x27;s pre-qualification status, besides the basic DTI issue, are: monthly gross disposable income, the number of open credit lines the buyer has, and assets. Other factors that are important, because they may affect the rate of interest, which directly affects the DTI by changing the mortgage payment amount are property type, property use, property location, loan-to-value ratio (LTV), what state the loan is in, credit score, the purpose of the loan, whether or not the applicant is a first time home buyer, if the refinance has a &quot;cash-out&quot; amount requested, whether or not the applicant has had a bankruptcy or foreclosure, how many times the applicant has been late on a mortgage payment, the applicant&#x27;s income type and the way the applicant will verify income (W-2, tax returns, bank statements, etc.).

<doc id="423956" wikidata="Q7225224" url="?curid=423956" title="Politics of Communist Czechoslovakia">
<text>Although political control of [[Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia|Communist Czechoslovakia]] was largely monopolized by the authoritarian Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ), the party technically shared political power with other parties of the National Front. The leader (General Secretary or First Secretary) of the KSČ was &quot;de facto&quot; the most powerful person in the country during this period. Czechoslovakia&#x27;s foreign policy was openly influenced by the foreign policy of the Soviet Union.

==National Front==
Other parties and organizations existed formally but functioned in subordinate roles to KSČ, because the KSČ was grouped together with the KSS, four other political parties, and all of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s mass organizations under the political umbrella of the National Front of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.

==Influence of the Soviet Union==
Czechoslovakia continued to demonstrate subservience to the policies of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in domestic and especially in foreign affairs.

Czechoslovakia&#x27;s political alignment with the Soviet Union began during World War II. In 1945, it was the Soviet Red Army that liberated Prague from the Nazis. The continued presence of the Red Army in Czechoslovakia until 1946 facilitated the communists&#x27; efforts to reorganize local government, the militia, and the Czechoslovak army and to place communists in key positions. Following the February 1948 coup d&#x27;état in which the communists seized power, Soviet influence over Czechoslovakia grew markedly. It was abetted through formal alliances, such as the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon) and the Warsaw Pact, and through direct intervention, in the 1968 invasion. In the immediate post-World War II period, many Czechoslovak citizens supported the alliance with the Soviet Union. They did not anticipate, however, the rigidities of the Stalinist rule that followed. The extent of the repression during the early years of the rule by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (Komunistická strana Československa — the KSČ) was unprecedented. In the early 1950s, some 900,000 persons were purged from the ranks of the KSČ; just about 100,000 were jailed for such political crimes as &quot;bourgeois nationalism.&quot; Antonín Novotný became First Secretary of the KSČ in 1953, the year of Stalin&#x27;s death, and continued to rule in Stalin&#x27;s rigidly authoritarian style for fifteen years. In practice (though not in rhetoric), Novotný ignored Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s 1956 denunciation of Stalin and made no attempt to imitate the Soviet Union&#x27;s decentralization of communist party rule. A considerable portion of the party hierarchy did take note of the Soviet decentralization, however. In 1968, they removed Novotný from power and initiated the Prague Spring.

The Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 was a pivotal event in Czechoslovakia&#x27;s political development. The August intervention by forces from the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), Poland, Bulgaria, and Hungary marked the beginning of the end of the Prague Spring and the reformist policies introduced by the Alexander Dubček regime. It also set the stage for the reemergence in Czechoslovakia of a pro-Soviet regime and a politically orthodox environment under the leadership of Gustáv Husák and Miloš Jakeš, which lasted until 1989, even during perestroika in the Soviet Union.

==Ethnic considerations==
This was another essential ingredient in Czechoslovak political culture. The Slovaks, having their own state during World War II, were never as satisfied as the Czechs with the nation created in 1918 because they felt dominated by the numerically superior Czech nationals. The communist takeover in 1948 did not lead to equitable treatment of Czechs and Slovaks.

The Stalinist purges of the early 1950s were particularly harsh on Slovaks; indeed, the definition of &quot;bourgeois nationalism&quot; coincided quite precisely with the aspirations of Slovak nationalism. Among the Slovak leaders arrested and jailed in the early 1950s was Gustáv Husák. Husák later was rehabilitated and eventually named General Secretary (the title changed from First Secretary in 1971) of the KSČ and President of the republic.

Slovak aspirations for greater autonomy played an important role in the political environment during the 1960s. The reform movement associated with the Prague Spring advocated greater independence for Slovakia. The 1968 constitutional amendments redefined Czechoslovakia as a federation of two equal states and nations, the Czech nation and the Slovak nation, and increased the responsibilities of the constituent republics. However, this decentralization of power did not survive the 1968 invasion and subsequent normalization policies. On paper, the federation remained and the Slovak Socialist Republic retained its separate communist party organization (see: Communist Party of Slovakia) and republic-level government organs. In practice, whatever power the 1968 amendments gave to the Slovaks was diminished when the Husák regime reestablished centralized party and government control in the 1970s (although Husák was a Slovak himself). But in sum, the federalization of Czechoslovakia remained an important step in Czechoslovak politics.

<doc id="423958" wikidata="Q7239194" url="?curid=423958" title="Pre-approval">
<text>In lending, a pre-approval is the pre-qualification for a loan or mortgage of a certain value range.

For a general loan a lender, via public or proprietary information, feels that a potential borrower is completely credit-worthy enough for a certain credit product, and approaches the potential customer with a guarantee that should they want that product, they would be guaranteed to get it. This rarely happens in the financial services industry, and when it does happen, it is usually loaded with fine print that is not immediately disclosed. Usually, what happens is pre-qualification, instead.

Although, to a typical consumer, &quot;you&#x27;re pre-approved&quot; means &quot;you already passed the approval process and therefore are guaranteed to be immediately granted the loan if you apply,&quot; the literal meaning is different. The literal meaning is &quot;at a stage before approval.&quot; Thus, the term &quot;pre-approved&quot; is often used by advertisers to induce consumers to apply for the advertiser&#x27;s offer.

The legal meaning however is varying depending on circumstances surrounding the overall context of the offer, and federal and state laws applied regarding individual consumer claims, and/or actions brought by consumer advocation agencies.

For a mortgage, people interested in buying a house can often approach a lender, who will check their credit history and verify their income, and then can provide assurances they would be able to get a loan up to a certain amount. This pre-approval can then help a buyer find a home that is within their loan amount range. Buyers can ask for a letter of pre-approval from the lender, and when shopping for a home can have possibly an advantage over others because they can show the seller that they are more likely to be able to buy the house. Often real estate agents prefer to work with a buyer who has a pre-approval as it demonstrates that they are well-qualified to receive financing and are serious about buying a home. A pre-approval is based on the documentation the borrower supplies at the time of application, and any actual eligibility to receive the pre-approved loan depends on the terms and conditions of the pre-approval and the ability to secure the loan before the pre-approval expires.

In case the buyer will put down a downpayment of less than 20%, he will have to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI) each month besides the mortgage payments. The PMI is automatically canceled once the buyer has 20% equity in its home.

== Disingenuous credit card offers ==
Many credit card companies and other money lending companies, will send out letters to people using the terms &quot;You&#x27;re pre-approved&quot;. This is disingenuous by the companies because they fully know that many consumers will see it and believe it means they have already passed the approval process when in fact they have not.

<doc id="423959" wikidata="Q2363504" url="?curid=423959" title="Startide Rising">
<text>Startide Rising is a 1983 science fiction novel by American writer David Brin, the second book of six set in his Uplift Universe (preceded by &quot;Sundiver&quot; and followed by &quot;The Uplift War&quot;). It earned both Hugo and Nebula Awards for Best Novel in 1984. It was revised by the author in 1993 to correct errors and omissions from the original edition.

An early work by David Brin, it was extremely well reviewed when it was published, has remained popular, and served as the seed for three more novels which revolved around the crew of the Earthship &quot;Streaker&quot; (the &quot;Uplift Storm Trilogy&quot;).

Parts of &quot;Startide Rising&quot; were published as &quot;The Tides of Kithrup&quot; in the May 1981 issue of &quot;Analog&quot;. &quot;The Tides of Kithrup&quot; was an early title of the novel; uncorrected proofs of the novel that still bear that title have become collector&#x27;s items.

== Plot summary ==

In the year 2489 C.E., the Terran spaceship &quot;Streaker&quot; — crewed by 150 uplifted dolphins, seven humans, and one uplifted chimpanzee — discovers a derelict fleet of spaceships the size of small moons in a shallow cluster. They appear to belong to the Progenitors, the legendary &quot;first race&quot; that uplifted the other species. The captain&#x27;s gig is sent to investigate but is destroyed along with one of the derelict craft — killing 10 crew members. &quot;Streaker&quot; manages to recover some artifacts from the destroyed derelict and one well-preserved alien body. The crew of &quot;Streaker&quot; uses psi-cast to inform Earth of their discovery and to send a hologram of the alien.

When &quot;Streaker&quot; receives a reply, it is in code. Decrypted, it says only: “Go into hiding. Await orders. Do not reply.” Attempting to comply, &quot;Streaker&quot; is ambushed at the Morgran transfer point and pursued by opposing fleets belonging to a number of extremist galactic clans and species (most or all of them devout of the quasi-religious &quot;Alliances&quot;) — &#x27;crusaders&#x27; seeking to claim the dead fleet for themselves for various religious reasons.

The novel begins about one month after the discovery in the cluster as &quot;Streaker&quot; arrives on the planet Kithrup, which has vast oceans, offering an ideal environment for the neodolphin crew to attempt to hide and repair their damaged ship. Almost immediately, the crusaders begin to arrive — dashing &quot;Streaker&quot;&#x27;s hopes of hiding for very long, but some time remains for repairs when the armadas begin fighting each other for the right to capture &quot;Streaker&quot;. 

A Thennanin dreadnought is damaged during the fighting and crashes into the ocean near &quot;Streaker&quot;&#x27;s hiding place. The resultant tsunami strands several crew and causes several of the neo-dolphins to panic and revert to an instinctual, pre-uplifted mental state. Some of the stranded crew encounter pre-sentient natives (called Kiqui).

Meanwhile, on &quot;Streaker&quot;, several crew members secretly plan a mutiny and defection while the officers plan to salvage parts from the Thennanin wreck. &quot;Streaker&quot; cannot be moved for fear of detection and because of the ongoing repairs, and so the salvage team uses undersea transportation to get to the wreck. The salvage team discovers the wreck&#x27;s hull is mostly undamaged, and the Terrans form a plan to hide &quot;Streaker&quot; inside the Thennanin dreadnought hull and make their escape. As a bonus, several crew members salvage the Thennanin dreadnought&#x27;s micro-branch of the galactic library for comparison with the &quot;Streaker&quot;&#x27;s own copy, as Earth suspects their libraries have been sabotaged, with certain information redacted &quot;for the greater good&quot; of &#x27;primitive&#x27; humans.

The mutinous crew, led by Takkata-Jim, sabotage equipment, leading to Captain Creideiki becoming brain damaged, although he later recovers somewhat. Before he can be caught, Takkata-Jim flees in a shuttle, but the shuttle has been sabotaged by the loyal crew, and he is sent into the middle of the battle over Kithrup with his radio disabled and his weapons set to fire when any ship approaches. Takkata-Jim unintentionally draws off the two largest remaining fleets.

In the confusion, &quot;Streaker&quot; almost escapes without incident hidden in the Thennanin hull, but is confronted by several ships belonging to the Brothers of the Night (Brethren). &quot;Streaker&quot; is saved when six Thennanin ships, saving one of their &quot;own&quot;, fight off the Brethren warriors. &quot;Streaker&quot; then flees to the transfer point, but before fleeing, sends a mocking transmission to the crusading armadas.

The dolphins in the novel speak three languages: Primal, Trinary and Anglic. Primal and Trinary are represented as haiku-esque poems (two of the human characters quote Yosa Buson), while Anglic is a hypothetical English-derivative (not to be confused with the actual Anglic family of languages containing modern English, its ancestors, and its close relatives like Scots), rendered for the reader as standard English.

The book shifts point of view frequently from character to character, ranging from humans, to dolphins, to a number of the alien races that are trying to destroy, capture, or help the &quot;Streaker&quot;. This allows the reader to get some idea of how the crew of the &quot;Streaker&quot; fits within the larger context of Galactic affairs. All of the alien races described in this book, and numerous others, are further described and illustrated in the book &quot;Contacting Aliens: An Illustrated Guide to David Brin&#x27;s Uplift Universe&quot;.

== Film version ==

In 1998 a screenplay, written by Trevor Sands and based on the book, was in development at Mace Neufeld Productions. However, according to Trevor Sands, the option expired and the screenplay has been tabled.

<text>The mass media in [[Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia|Communist Czechoslovakia]] was controlled by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ). Private ownership of any publication or agency of the mass media was generally forbidden, although churches and other organizations published small periodicals and newspapers. Even with this informational monopoly in the hands of organizations under KSČ control, all publications were reviewed by the government&#x27;s Office for Press and Information. Censorship was lifted for three months during the 1968 Prague Spring but afterward was reimposed under the terms of the 1966 Press Law. The law states that the Czechoslovak press is to provide complete information, but it must also advance the interests of socialist society and promote the people&#x27;s socialist awareness of the policy of the communist party as the leading force in society and state.

Government concern about control of the mass media was such that it was illegal to own a duplicating machine or to reproduce more than eleven copies of any printed material. Nevertheless, a fairly wide distribution of underground publications (popularly known as samizdat throughout Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union) that were established during the Nazi occupation continued throughout communist rule into the 1980s.

== Newspapers ==
*The chief newspaper of the KSČ was the Prague daily, &quot;Rudé Právo&quot;, which, with a circulation of 900,000 in the 1980s, was the most widely read and most influential newspaper in the country. Its editor in 1987 was Zdeněk Hoření, a member of the Secretariat of the KSČ Central Committee.
*Its sister publication, Bratislava&#x27;s &quot;Pravda&quot;, was the organ of the KSS.
*Other dailies with large circulations were e. g. Lidová Demokracie, published by the Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Party (see National Front); &quot;Mladá Fronta&quot; in Bohemia/ &quot;Smena&quot; in Slovakia published by the Socialist Union of Youth (see National Front); &quot;Práce&quot; in Bohemia / &quot;Práca&quot; in Slovakia published by the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement; &quot;Svobodné Slovo&quot;, published by the Czechoslovak Socialist Party, and &quot;Ľud&quot;, published by the Slovak Revival Party.

The Czechoslovak Press Agency (in Czech: &quot;Československá tisková kancelář&quot;, in Slovak: &quot;Československá tlačová kancelária&quot; ČTK / ČTK) received a state subsidy and was controlled by the federal government through its Presidium.

== TV and radio ==
The government also controlled several domestic television and radio networks. Radio Prague broadcast domestically and internationally.

Czechoslovak Television started broadcasting in 1953 from Prague, in 1955 from Ostrava and in 1956 from Bratislava. Daily broadcasting started in 1959, broadcasting in colour in 1970 from Bratislava. A second TV channel was added in 1970. Since then, the first TV channel was conceived as a federal one (i.e. mostly in Czech, but also in Slovak), the second TV channel was different for the Czech Socialist Republic (in Czech) and for the Slovak Socialist Republic (in Slovak). A third TV channel was added only in the mid-late 1980s. It broadcast the First Programme of Soviet Union Central Television.

TV was not jammed by the authorities. The radio station Voice of America and the BBC World Service also had some audiences in Czechoslovakia, and their broadcasts were subject to only occasional jamming. Radio Free Europe broadcasts, however, were extensively jammed.

<doc id="423963" wikidata="Q47527" url="?curid=423963" title="It's Christmas in Canada">
<text>&quot;It&#x27;s Christmas in Canada&quot; (sometimes called &quot;Christmas in Canada&quot;) is the fifteenth and final episode of the seventh season of the American animated series &quot;South Park&quot; and the 111th episode of the series. The episode originally aired on December 17, 2003 and was nominated for an Emmy Award. The episode parodies the film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

In the episode, the Broflovski family is dealt a devastating blow when Ike&#x27;s Canadian birth parents show up unexpectedly, and want their baby back. When the townspeople decide to forgo Christmas gifts and take up a collection to get Ike home to South Park, the boys are distraught. Before all the money for their Christmas presents gets spent, they hightail it to Canada to bring Ike home themselves.

This was the final episode to feature Eliza Schneider&#x27;s voice due to pay concerns.

== Plot ==
The Broflovski family is celebrating Hanukkah together when a Canadian couple, who introduce themselves as Harry and Elise Gintz, come to their house. Just as Harry begins explaining why they have sought out the Broflovskis, Kyle and Ike walk into view to see who is at the door and Elise immediately rushes in to hug Ike, who hides behind Kyle. While talking in the dining area, with Kyle and Ike outside listening in, Harry and Elise reveal they are Ike&#x27;s biological parents, addressing him by his birth name &quot;Peter&quot;. They gave Ike up during the Cola wars in Canada. Harry justifies their right to change their mind about putting Ike up for adoption as, due to a new law made by the Prime Minister of Canada, all Canadian-born children living in America must be returned to their biological parents. The Gintzes depart, with the Broflovskis vowing to fight them in court. Unfortunately, the Canadian law cannot be overturned by South Park&#x27;s court, so Ike is given to the Gintzes. After Ike sadly leaves with his biological parents, Kyle notices his parents steadily getting worse as time without Ike goes on and attempts to get his friends to help him, but they have other things on their minds: Cartman believes that presents are more important, and Stan is obsessed with the Christmas adventures that he may have this year.

South Park&#x27;s citizens decide to act kindly towards the Broflovskis and agree to give them their Christmas gift money to help fund their legal battle over the Canadian Prime Minister, leaving their children without any presents: which Cartman blames on Kyle. Kyle deduces that if the boys can retrieve Ike themselves in the few days before Christmas, the donations would be unnecessary, thus the boys bargain with City Wok owner Tuong Lu Kim to fly to Canada. During the flight, the plane suffers from mechanical troubles and runs out of gas. Tuong parachutes from the plane, leaving the four boys inside. It crashes in Canada, but the boys get out relatively unscathed. Recovering, they meet a group of Canadians, including Scott: an uptight, rude Canadian who derides Americans and furthermore belittles his cohorts&#x27; kind attitude towards them. Traveling to Ottawa on the &quot;only road&quot; in Canada, the boys meet others plagued by the new Prime Minister&#x27;s laws: such as a Mountie named Rick, who is forced to ride a sheep instead of a horse; an unnamed French Canadian mime, who can no longer drink wine; and a Newfoundlander named Steve, who can no longer practice sodomy. In Newfoundland, Steve points out that they were heading in the wrong direction, though utilizes his boat to get the group to the prime minister in time.

In the Centre Block of the Parliament Buildings, the boys ask for a guard to let them in, but he insists the Prime Minister sees nobody and slams the door. Steve and the mime turn around to go home, reasoning &quot;We gave it our best, but our best wasn&#x27;t good enough, eh?&quot;, but Kyle pleads with the guard, who says the Prime Minister is in China. Disappointed, the four boys sit on the steps and cry until the guard, now feeling sorry for them, admits he was lying and allows them entrance. The boys finally meet with the Prime Minister, a gigantic floating head who is a brutal dictator and refuses to repeal his laws. Scott then arrives with the Gintzes, and, along with Kyle, appeal to the Prime Minister to support their separate views. The Prime Minister rejects Kyle&#x27;s speech, and to prove his point, vaporizes Kenny. Stan reveals that the gigantic floating head is mechanically controlled by Saddam Hussein in a spider-hole. Upon discovery of the Prime Minister&#x27;s true identity, the Canadians arrest Hussein (a reference to Hussein&#x27;s actual arrest four days before the episode aired) and declare all of the new laws null and void. The Gintzes realize how much Kyle must care for Ike to come all the way to Canada and they give Ike the choice to go back to America, which he accepts as he hugs Kyle. Cartman&#x27;s watch goes off, and he is upset about missing Christmas, but Kyle insists that he got his brother back and that&#x27;s all that matters; Cartman, however, gets angry and tries to fight Kyle. Kyle at first is reluctant but then hits Cartman only once (barely), causing Cartman to whine pathetically and cry for his mother, until Rick the Mountie invites the boys to celebrate Christmas Canadian-style, being part of a parade celebrating Hussein&#x27;s capture and the boys&#x27; efforts to remove him from power. Oblivious to what just happened, Stan and Cartman (whose nose is bleeding as a result of the mere hit) are unhappy; Stan sighs and says that maybe they will have a better Christmas adventure next year.

<doc id="423964" wikidata="Q3509109" url="?curid=423964" title="Ninth-of-May Constitution">
<text>The Ninth-of-May (1948) Constitution (; ) was the second constitution of Czechoslovakia, in force from 1948 to 1960. It came into force on 9 May, shortly after the communist seizure of power in the country on 25 February 1948. It replaced the 1920 Constitution.

Work on the new document had been underway since the summer of 1946. As a result, it was not a fully Communist constitution. It was superficially similar to its predecessor; indeed, several provisions were directly carried over from the earlier document. However, it contained a number of elements borrowed from the &quot;Stalin Constitution&quot; of the Soviet Union. The Soviet imprint on the final document was strong enough that President Edvard Beneš refused to sign it and later resigned. It was flagrantly violated by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ), the government and many individuals throughout the period of its being in force, especially regarding the provisions on private ownership and human rights.

Since the country&#x27;s liberation, there had been many disputes concerning nationalization, the relation of Czechs and Slovaks and other crucial issues. After the Communist take-over in February 1948, the Communist concept was largely applied. The constitution did not organize government administration under the Leninist principle of democratic centralism (a provision only incorporated in the following &quot;socialist&quot; 1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia); indeed, it made no references to Communism or the KSČ. However, it did declare that Czechoslovakia had embarked on a &quot;national and democratic revolution&quot; that it intended to defend against &quot;domestic and foreign reaction.&quot; It billed the 1948 coup d&#x27;etat as a defense of &quot;the People&#x27;s Democratic Order.&quot;

The constitution proclaimed Czechoslovakia a &quot;people&#x27;s democratic state&quot; in which the people were &quot;the sole source of all power.&quot; It declared that the economy of Czechoslovakia was based on nationalized industries, nationalized trade and a nationalized financial sector. The government sector was declared the basis of the economy, but it protected the private sector and cooperatives as well. It also granted a small degree of autonomy to Slovakia, which was given its own legislative body and governmental structure, although these were made subordinate to the central authorities in Prague. The parliament continued to be called the National Assembly, though the Senate was abolished.

Unlike most Communist constitutions, the Ninth-of-May Constitution did not replace the presidency with a collective body. It also afforded protections against arbitrary arrest; no one could be taken into custody without a warrant. On the other hand, the provisions enshrining civil rights were effectively neutered by a provision that forbade their use in order to make &quot;statements and acts that constitute a threat to the independence, entirety, and unity of the State, the Constitution, the Republican form of government, or the People&#x27;s Democratic Order&quot; and allowed their restriction &quot;when events occur that threaten in increased measure the independence, entirety, and unity of the State, the Constitution, the Republican form of government, and the People&#x27;s Democratic Order, or public law and order.&quot; The constitutional guarantee of press freedom was rendered meaningless by provisions making movies and broadcasting state monopolies and giving the government sole power to decide who could publish periodicals. Judges were required to abide by both laws and government ordinances, thus taking away judges&#x27; right to strike down executive actions that did not accord with statutes.

<text>Mazkeret Batya () (lit. &quot;Batya Memorial&quot;) is a local council in central Israel located southeast of Rehovot and from Tel Aviv. Mazkeret Batya spans an area of 7,440 dunams (7 km2). In it had a population of . The mayor of Mazkeret Batya is Gaby Gaon.

==History==
Mazkeret Batya, initially Ekron, was established on November 7, 1883 by 11 ultra-Orthodox Jewish farmers from Russia, one of them Yaakov Laskovsky. It was the first agricultural settlement of the Hovevei Zion movement. 

The land was purchased by Baron Rothschild to promote Jewish agriculture in Palestine. Rabbi Shmuel Mohilever was instrumental in mobilizing funding and organizing the settlers. Mohilever&#x27;s remains were later reinterred in the Mazkeret Batya cemetery. In 1887 the name was changed to Mazkeret Batya, in memory of Betty Solomon de Rothschild, mother of Baron Edmond James de Rothschild. The history of the founding is described in the book &quot;Rebels in the Holy Land&quot;, by the historian Sam Finkle where he writes about the community&#x27;s struggle to uphold the laws of the sabbatical year despite fierce opposition.

The economy of the village was originally based on dry farming, which continued even after the Mekorot Company constructed a pipeline to bring water from Rehovot. In 1947, Mazkeret Batya was home to 475 people.

According to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Mazkeret Batya (then Ekron) had a population 368 Jews. 
During the Mandate era, a Jewish police station was established in Mazkeret Batya to safeguard the local roads. In the War of Independence, convoys to besieged Jerusalem left from Mazkeret Batya. A field hospital operated there to care for Haganah fighters wounded at Latrun.

According to one source, at the end of the British Mandate for Palestine, the British tried to hand the nearby Aqir airfield and camp to the Palestinian Arabs, apparently without success.

Due to its proximity to Tel Aviv, Mazkeret Batya has experienced a growth spurt, becoming a mixed community of religious and secular Jews. Historic landmarks include Beit Ha&#x27;Itut (Signal House), the Great Synagogue, Beit Meshek HaBaron (&quot;The Baron&#x27;s Farmhouse&quot;, now housing a cultural center), the saqiya-type water-rising system with its wooden wheels, well and pool, and an old farmyard.

<doc id="423967" wikidata="Q2902013" url="?curid=423967" title="Okadama Airport">
<text>, commonly known as , is a dual-use airport located in , Higashi-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido, north of the city center of Sapporo. Its scheduled airline service is limited to turboprop flights to other cities in Hokkaidō; larger aircraft use New Chitose Airport, south of the city. The airport is also used by Camp Okadama of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force and by corporate and general aviation operators: an adjacent facility houses the air traffic control center for Hokkaido and the Tohoku region. The airport houses the headquarters of Hokkaido Air System.

==History==
Okadama was constructed between 1942 and 1944 as an airfield for the Imperial Japanese Army. Following Japan&#x27;s surrender to the United States in 1945, ending World War II, the United States Army Air Forces took over the airfield, using it as a training base until the end of the US occupation in 1952. Following the occupation, the field reverted to the Japan Self-Defense Forces.

Scheduled civilian passenger operations began in June 1956 when North Japan Airlines (later Japan Domestic Airlines, Toa Domestic Airlines and Japan Air System) began service to Memanbetsu. All Nippon Airways began service to Okadama in 1966. These airlines operated propeller service at the airport through the mid-1970s, chiefly using NAMC YS-11 turboprops. Although the airport&#x27;s main runway was extended from 1,000 to 1,500 m in 1967, most scheduled traffic migrated to New Chitose Airport which was better equipped to handle larger jet aircraft. In 1974, Toa ceased operations at Okadama and ANA established a new subsidiary, Air Nippon, to handle YS-11 flights at the airport. ANA later replaced its YS-11s with quieter Bombardier Dash 8 turboprops.

In 1995, the city of Sapporo proposed extending the runway to 2,000 m in order to allow jet service at Okadama. This plan met protests from neighboring residents, and was abandoned in 1996. In 1998, local residents agreed to an extension of the runway to 1,500 m in exchange for a cap of 44 daily takeoffs and landings.

ANA, which accounted for 80% of passenger traffic at Okadama, ceased Okadama operations in 2010, leaving JAL affiliate Hokkaido Air System as the airport&#x27;s only scheduled carrier. The airport terminal (operated by a company 26% owned by the Sapporo government) operated at a slight profit until fiscal year 2009, but the departure of ANA group traffic drove its finances into a net loss. HAC continues to serve the airport using Saab 340 turboprops which have since been replaced by the ATR 42.

In November 2013, Fuji Dream Airlines operated a regional jet charter to Okadama from Komaki Airport in Nagoya, the first passenger jet service in the airport&#x27;s history.

In July 2023, Sapporo City officially announced that it would extend the runway to 1,800 meters, with the understanding of local residents.

<doc id="423968" wikidata="Q3502307" url="?curid=423968" title="1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia">
<text>The Constitution of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (&quot;Ústava Československé socialistické / Československej socialistickej republiky&quot; in Czech / Slovak), promulgated on 11 July 1960 as the constitutional law 100/1960 Sb., was the third constitution of Czechoslovakia, and the second adopted under Communist rule. It replaced the 1948 Ninth-of-May Constitution and was widely changed by the Constitutional Law of Federation in 1968. It was extensively revised after the Velvet Revolution to prune out its state socialist character. The revision was intended to allow the document to be used until it could be replaced with a completely new constitution. However, this never took place, and it remained in force until the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1992.

==Overview==
The Ninth-of-May-Constitution was superficially similar in many respects to the 1920 Constitution and contained a mixture of liberal democratic and state socialist elements. In contrast, the 1960 Constitution was a fully state socialist document. It borrowed heavily from the 1936 Soviet Constitution (known as &quot;the Stalin Constitution&quot;). This was reflected in the change of the country&#x27;s official name from the Czechoslovak Republic (which was described as a people&#x27;s democratic state&quot; after the 1948 Communist takeover) to Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. Due to President and party boss Antonín Novotný&#x27;s devotion to Nikita Khrushchev and oneupmanship among other Eastern Bloc countries, Czechoslovakia was declared the first country after &quot;our great ally, the fraternal Union of Soviet Socialist Republics&quot; to have achieved socialism (three years before the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and five before the Socialist Republic of Romania). Thus the constitution&#x27;s preamble said that &quot;socialism has won in our country,&quot; proclaiming that the last obstacle to socialism had been removed by &quot;the determined action of the working people in February 1948.&quot; It went on to say that as a result of &quot;finishing the socialist construction, we are changing over to building an advanced socialist society and gathering strength for the transition to communism.&quot;

The 1960 Constitution severely limited the autonomy granted to Slovakia. This provision was Novotný&#x27;s idea. The executive branch of the Slovak government was abolished and its duties assigned to the Presidium of the Slovak National Council, thus combining executive and legislative functions into a single body. The legislative National Assembly was given authority to overrule decisions of the Slovak National Council, and central government agencies took over the administration of the major organs of Slovak local government.

The constitution was first amended by constitutional laws 110/1967 (status of Prague local councils to be set by special law), 28/1968 (similar for Bratislava), the Constitutional Law of Federation 143/1968 and accompanying 144/1968 on ethnic minorities, and further by constitutional laws 57/1969 (local councils put into the authority of national republics), 155/1969 (court reform), 43/1971 (elected bodies term of office prolonged to 5 years from 4), 50/1975 (this actually affected only the Constitutional Law of Federation, into which the Presidency had been moved: President unable to carry out his duties over a year can be replaced, i. e. ill Ludvík Svoboda with Gustáv Husák), 62/1978 (a minor change about schooling, see below), 135/1989 (leading role of the KSČ abolished etc.) and several times during 1990–1992 (e. g. 102/1990 change of the national symbols - the constitutional laws changing the country&#x27;s name twice weren&#x27;t formally amendments to the constitution; 23/1991 incorporation of the human rights charter that replaced the Chapter 2 below, etc.).

==Structure==
The Constitution consisted of a preamble and 112 articles divided into 9 chapters. Chapter 1, entitled &quot;The Social Order,&quot; declares Czechoslovakia to be a &quot;socialist state, founded on the firm bond of workers, peasants and intelligentsia, in whose lead is the working class.&quot; It declared Czechoslovakia to be a member of &quot;the world socialist system&quot; dedicated to &quot;friendly relations to all nations and securing lasting peace in the whole world&quot;. The paragraph whereby it was &quot;a unitary State of two fraternal nations possessing equal rights – the Czechs and the Slovaks&quot; was changed into &quot;federal state&quot; and moved into the Law of Federation in 1968.

While Article 1 of the Ninth-of-May Constitution vested all power in &quot;the people,&quot; Article 2 of the 1960 Constitution vested power in &quot;the working people.&quot; State power was exercised &quot;by the working people through representative bodies which are elected by, surveilled by, and accountable to them.&quot; Article 4 codified the actual state of affairs that had prevailed in the country since 1948 by declaring, &quot;The leading force in the society and the state is the vanguard of the working class, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ).&quot; The party had not even been mentioned in the Ninth-of-May Constitution.

Principles of the &quot;socialist economic system, in which the means of production are socialised and the entire national economy directed by plan&quot; and the rules of democratic centralism, are also laid out. &quot;Socialist ownership&quot; takes two forms: state ownership especially of natural resources, the means of industrial production, public transportation and communications, banks and insurance companies, mass media and health, educational, and scientific facilities; and cooperative ownership, which is the property of people&#x27;s cooperatives (Art. 8). Small private enterprises &quot;based on [owner&#x27;s] personal labour and excluding exploitation of others&#x27; workforce&quot; are permitted within limits (9) formally; this in practice concerned agriculture. Personal ownership of consumer goods, &quot;family homes, and savings earned through labour&quot; is guaranteed, as is inheritance of such property (10).

Chapter 2 describes the rights and duties of citizens. Equal rights regardless of nationality, race, or sex are guaranteed (20). Education is free and compulsory to the age of fifteen (24; this was changed to &quot;set by law&quot; as impractical in the education reform of the 1970s); citizens of Hungarian, Ukrainian, and Polish ethnicity are ensured &quot;all opportunities and means for education in their mother tongue&quot; (25; this was abolished and replaced by somewhat more detailed constitutional law on minorities 144/1968, which also took in account Germans and listed Rusyns as synonym to Ukrainians). &quot;All citizens have the right of work and compensation for work done according to its amount, quality and social import&quot; (21), &quot;all workers&quot; have the right of medical care and material security in old age and in case of disability (23). &quot;In accordance with the interests of the working people, all citizens are guaranteed&quot; freedom of speech and press (28). Also guaranteed is the &quot;right to profess any religious faith or to be without religious conviction, and to practice religious acts unless this contravenes the law&quot;; conscientious objection to &quot;civic duty set by law&quot; based on religious conviction is specifically prohibited (32) while citizens are bound to serve in the armed forces (37).
Chapters 3 to 6 deal with the National Assembly, President, government and Slovak National Council respectively and were abolished and replaced by the Constitutional Law of Federation in 1968. Chapter 7 concerns National Committees (i. e. local and regional government), 8 judiciary system and 9 general and concluding provisions.

<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives,  represents one of the simplest possible types, that with two axles and four coupled wheels, all of which are driven. The wheels on the earliest four-coupled locomotives were connected by a single gear wheel, but from 1825 the wheels were usually connected with coupling rods to form a single driven set.

The notation 0-4-0T indicates a tank locomotive of this wheel arrangement on which its water and fuel is carried on board the engine itself, rather than in an attached tender.

In Britain, the Whyte notation of wheel arrangement was also often used for the classification of electric and diesel-electric locomotives with side-rod-coupled driving wheels.

Under the UIC classification used in Europe and, in more recent years, in simplified form in the United States, a 0-4-0 is classified as B (German and Italian) if the axles are connected by side rods or gearing and 020 (French), independent of axle motoring. The UIC&#x27;s Bo classification for electric and diesel-electric locomotives indicates that the axles are independently motored, which would be under the Whyte notation.
==Overview==
0-4-0 locomotives were built as tank locomotives as well as tender locomotives. The former were more common in Europe and the latter in the United States, except in the tightest of situations such as that of a shop switcher locomotive, where overall length was a concern. The earliest 0-4-0 locomotives were tender engines and appeared as early as c. 1802. The 0-4-0 tank engines were introduced in the early 1850s. The type was found to be so useful in many locations that they continued to be built for more than a century and existed until the end of the steam era.
Richard Trevithick&#x27;s &quot;Coalbrookedale&quot; (1802), &quot;Pen-y-Darren&quot; (1804) and &quot;Newcastle&quot; (1805) locomotives were of the 0-4-0 type, although in their cases the wheels were connected by a single gear wheel. The first 0-4-0 to use coupling rods was Locomotion No. 1, built by Robert Stephenson and Company for the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825. Stephenson also built the Lancashire Witch in 1828, and Timothy Hackworth built Sans Pareil which ran at the Rainhill Trials in 1829. The latter two locomotives later worked on the Bolton and Leigh Railway.

A four-wheeled configuration, where all the wheels are driving wheels, uses all the locomotive&#x27;s mass for traction but is inherently unstable at speed. The type was therefore mainly used for switcher locomotives (also known as shunter locomotives in the United Kingdom). Because of the lack of stability, tender engines of this type were only built for a few decades in the United Kingdom. They were built for a longer period in the United States.

The possible tractive effort of an 0-4-0 within normal axle load limits was not enough to move large loads. By 1900, they had therefore largely been superseded for most purposes by locomotives with more complex wheel arrangements. They nevertheless continued to be used in situations where tighter radius curves existed or the shorter length was an advantage. Thus, they were commonly employed in dockyard work, industrial tramways, or as shop switchers.

The wheel arrangement was also used on specialised types such as fireless locomotives, crane tank locomotives, tram engines and geared steam locomotives. It was also widely used on narrow gauge railways.

==Usage==

===Australia===
In New South Wales, Dorrigo Steam Railway and Museum has preserved twelve 0-4-0 steam locomotives and eight 0-4-0 diesel locomotives, a total of twenty examples, all on the one site.

===Austria===

In Tyrol, Achensee Railway operates three 0-4-0 geared steam cog locomotives on their 1 meter narrow gauge tourist railway and has one on display. The locomotives were originally built by Wiener Lokomotivfabrik, but one has been rebuilt from scavenged parts.

===Angola===

The Catumbela Sugar Estate in Angola operated a narrow gauge line on the estate. One of their locomotives, Rührthaler Maschinen-Fabrik 963 of 1929, was later rebuilt with a diesel engine.

===Finland===

Finland had the E1 and Vk4 classes with an 0-4-0 wheel arrangement.

The E1 was a class of only two locomotives, numbered 76 and 77.

The Vk4 was also a class of only two locomotives, built by Borsig Lokomotiv Werke (AEG) of Germany in 1910. The Vk4s were used at a fortress, and were eventually also used in dismantling the fortress, after which one locomotive went into industrial use and was scrapped in 1951. The other was sold to the Finnish Railways and nicknamed &quot;Leena&quot;. It became No. 68 and is now the oldest working broad gauge locomotive in Finland, being preserved at the Finnish Railway Museum.

===Indonesia===
The &quot;Samarang-Cheribon Stoomtram Maatschappij&quot; or SCS imported 27 cape gauge 0-4-0T SCS Class 100 locomotives between 1908 and 1911, originally to operate services from Kalibrodi-Samarang to Tanggung and Yogyakarta. They were built by Sächsische Maschinenfabrik in Chemnitz, Germany. They were a modern locomotive design for the time, equipped with a superheater.

The largest allocation of SCS 100s were in Tegal, Central Java for services to Purwokerto. Some were later converted to tram engines and worked in Tegal and Purwokerto.

After Japanese occupation and Indonesian Independence, these locomotives were renumbered to B52 class. All 27 locomotives were in existence at the end of 1960, but by 1970 only 15 units remained. Two locomotives have been preserved, B5212 at the Transportation Museum of Taman Mini Indonesia Indah and B5210 at the Ambarawa Railway Museum.

===New Zealand===
The NZR A class of 1873 consisted of three engine types of similar specification but differing detail. They were British and New Zealand-built and several were preserved.

===Philippines===

The only examples of this type in the Philippines were the five &quot;Manila&quot; class light-duty tank locomotives built by Hunslet Engine Company for the Manila Railway. They were ordered in 1885 for the Tranvía system until they were used on the &quot;Ferrocarril de Manila a Dagupan&quot; in the 1890s. After being retired from the Manila Railroad in 1927, &quot;Manila&quot; was sold to the newly-formed Central Azucarrera de Tarlac, where it was made into a tank-tender locomotive until the 1980s. The locomotive was scrapped by 1991.

===South Africa===

====Brunel gauge====

In 1847, the government of the Cape Colony established harbour boards at its three major ports, Table Bay, Port Elizabeth and East London. While railway lines were laid at all these harbours, trains were for the most part initially hauled by oxen or mules. The first steam locomotives to see service at these harbours were Brunel gauge engines which were placed in service on breakwater construction at Table Bay Harbour in 1862 and East London Harbour in 1874.
* At Table Bay Harbour a third Brunel gauge 0-4-0T locomotive was acquired from Fletcher, Jennings &amp; Co. in 1874 to haul tip-wagons from the Victoria Basin excavation site to the breakwater which was being constructed simultaneously.
* The East London Harbour&#x27;s construction locomotives were 0-4-0 vertical boiler engines, similar in appearance to the American Grasshopper type. Four of them were acquired from Alexander Chaplin &amp; Co. between 1873 and 1880, although the first one was only placed in service in 1874.
* A fourth locomotive was added at Table Bay Harbour in 1879, a 0-4-0 well-tank engine, also built by Fletcher, Jennings.
* Three 0-4-0 saddle-tank locomotives entered breakwater construction service in Table Bay Harbour, two in 1881 and one more in 1893, built by Black, Hawthorn &amp; Co.

====Standard gauge====

In September 1859 Messrs. E. &amp; J. Pickering, contractors to the Cape Town Railway and Dock Company for the construction of the Cape Town-Wellington railway line, imported a small broad gauge 0-4-0 side-tank steam locomotive from England for use during the construction of the railway. This was the first locomotive in South Africa. In 1874 the locomotive was rebuilt to a 0-4-2T configuration before it was shipped to Port Alfred, where it served as construction locomotive on the banks of the Kowie river and was nicknamed &quot;Blackie&quot;. It has been declared a heritage object and was plinthed in the main concourse of Cape Town station.
The first railway locomotive to run in revenue earning service in South Africa was a small broad gauge 0-4-0WT well tank engine named &quot;Natal&quot;, manufactured by Carrett, Marshall and Company of Leeds. It made its inaugural run from Market Square to Point station in Durban during the official opening of the first operating railway in South Africa on Tuesday, 26 June 1860.

In 1865, the Natal Railway Company obtained a saddle-tank locomotive with a wheel arrangement from Kitson and Company. This was the Natal Railway&#x27;s second locomotive and was named &quot;Durban&quot;.

In 1878, while construction work by the Kowie Harbour Improvement Company was underway at Port Alfred, the Cape Government Railways acquired one broad gauge (Saddle Tank) locomotive named &quot;Aid&quot; from Fox, Walker and Company of Bristol for use as construction locomotive on the east bank of the Kowie river.

====Cape gauge====
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a number of 0-4-0 tank- and saddle-tank locomotives were imported into South Africa, many of them for use in harbours. Many of these locomotives came into South African Railways (SAR) stock in 1912, but were never classified.
* In 1873 and 1874, three Cape gauge saddle-tank locomotives, built by Manning Wardle, were placed in service by the Cape Government Railways, two on the Midland System in 1873 and the third on the Western System in 1874. They were the first Cape gauge locomotives to enter service in South Africa.
* In 1874, a third saddle-tank locomotive, also built by Manning Wardle, was delivered to the Midland System of the CGR in Port Elizabeth. The locomotive was of a smaller design than the earlier locomotives of 1873.
* Between 1875 and 1882, six saddle-tank locomotives with domeless boilers and three with domes were placed in service on all three systems of the CGR. They were all designated First Class when a classification system was adopted.
* In 1881, two Cape gauge saddle tank locomotives with a 0-4-0 wheel arrangement were placed in service by Teague and Company, who operated Teague&#x27;s Tramway at the Kimberley diamond mine. In 1885 one was sold to the mine and the other to the CGR for use during the construction of a temporary rail bridge across the Orange River at Norvalspont. In the process the CGR locomotive, nicknamed &quot;Coffee Pot&quot;, became the first locomotive to run across the border between the Cape Colony and the Orange Free State.
* Thirteen saddle-tank locomotives were acquired by the Table Bay Harbour Board from Black, Hawthorn and Company, Chapman and Furneaux and Hawthorn Leslie and Company between 1881 and 1904. Eleven survived to come into SAR stock in 1912, but were not included in the renumbering schedules or classified.
* In 1889 the &quot;Nederlandsche-Zuid-Afrikaansche Spoorwegmaatschappij&quot; (NZASM) obtained its first six locomotives for use on the new line which was being constructed from Johannesburg to Boksburg, one 13 Tonner and five very similar 14 Tonners.
* In 1889 and 1890 the NZASM obtained three 10 Tonner tramway locomotives for use on the new line from Johannesburg to Boksburg which became known as the Randtram line.
* In 1891 five saddle-tank locomotives were imported, built by Neilson and Company for the Natal Government Railways (NGR). One was later sold to the Pretoria-Pietersburg Railway (PPR), where it was named &quot;Natal&quot;, while two more went to the Durban Harbour. The remaining two were later included in the NGR&#x27;s Class K. In 1912, four of these locomotives survived, including the ex-PPR locomotive, to be taken onto the SAR roster as obsolete unclassified locomotives.
* Between 1894 and 1902 eight saddle-tank locomotives were acquired by the Port Elizabeth Harbour Board for shunting service at the Port Elizabeth Harbour, four built by Black, Hawthorn in 1894 and 1895, two by Chapman and Furneaux in 1900 and two by Hudswell, Clarke in 1902.
* In 1902 the Harbours Department of the Natal Government placed a single saddle-tank locomotive in service as harbour shunter in Durban Harbour. It was built by Hudswell, Clarke and named Congella.
* In 1903, a single 0-4-0ST locomotive, built by New Lowca Engineering, was delivered to the Port Elizabeth Harbour Board.
* After the Harbour Boards were disbanded, some locomotives entered SAR harbour service as previously owned. Two locomotives named &quot;Stormberg&quot; and &quot;Thebus&quot; were originally built by Hudswell Clarke for the South African Public Works Department in 1903. They were acquired by the SAR in 1916, but were named instead of being classified and numbered.
* The CGR acquired a single self-contained Railmotor with a 0-4-0T+4 wheel arrangement for low-volume passenger service. The railmotor was a 0-4-0 side-tank locomotive with a passenger coach as an integral part of the locomotive itself, with a four-wheeled bogie under the coach end.
* In 1907, the Central South African Railways also acquired a single self-contained Railmotor with a 0-4-0T+4 wheel arrangement.
* In 1929, the South African Railways acquired a single self-contained Clayton railmotor with a 0-4-0+4 wheel arrangement for low-volume passenger service. The vehicle was a vertical boilered steam locomotive with a passenger coach which was an integral part of the locomotive itself.
* In 1941, long after the Harbour Boards had ceased to exist, a contractor&#x27;s locomotive which had been imported for use on the Foreshore land reclamation project in Cape Town was bought by the SAR for use as dock shunter in Table Bay Harbour. It had been built in 1909 by Orenstein &amp; Koppel and on the SAR it was numbered SAR-H&amp;NW no. 69.

====Narrow gauges====

Between 1886 and 1888, three well-tank condensing locomotives were placed in service by the Cape Copper Mining Company on its Namaqualand Railway between Port Nolloth and O&#x27;okiep in the Cape Colony. They were the first condensing steam locomotives to enter service in South Africa. They were later rebuilt as conventional well-tank locomotives.

In 1899, Rand Mines acquired two narrow gauge tank steam locomotives from Avonside Engine Company and in 1900 a similar locomotive was delivered to Reynolds Brothers Sugar Estates in Natal. In 1915, when an urgent need arose for additional narrow gauge locomotives in German South West Africa during the First World War, these three locomotives were purchased second-hand by the South African Railways.
In 1900 the British War Office placed two Sirdar class 0-4-0T tank steam locomotives in service on a narrow gauge line near Germiston in the &quot;Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek&quot;, where the Royal Engineers had established a siege park during the Second Boer War. The locomotives were built by Kerr, Stuart and Company. At the end of the war, the two Sirdar locomotives were sold to a farmer, who used them on a firewood line between Pienaarsrivier and Pankop, until the line and locomotives were taken over by the Central South African Railways (CSAR). In 1912, when these locomotives were assimilated into the SAR, they were renumbered with an &quot;NG&quot; prefix to their numbers. When a system of grouping narrow gauge locomotives into classes was eventually introduced by the SAR somewhere between 1928 and 1930, they were designated .

In 1902, the CGR placed a single narrow gauge tank steam locomotive in service on the Avontuur branch, built by Manning Wardle, classified Type C and named &quot;Midget&quot;. In 1912, this locomotive was assimilated into the South African Railways and renumbered. It was sold to the West Rand Consolidated Mines near Krugersdorp in 1921.

A single small five-ton locomotive, built by Krauss &amp; Company, was purchased by the CGR c. 1903 and placed in service as construction engine on the narrow gauge Avontuur branch out of Port Elizabeth.

===United Kingdom===
====Tank locomotives====
The tank engine versions of the wheel arrangement began to appear in the United Kingdom in the early 1850s, with the first significant class being six saddle tanks designed by Robert Sinclair for the Caledonian Railway.
By 1860 the type was very popular and it continued to be built in significant numbers for both mainline and industrial railways, almost to the end of steam traction. Hudswell Clarke were supplying industrial saddle tanks until at least 1947, and both Barclay and Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns until 1949.

An interesting variation on this theme were the traction engine-based railway locomotives built by Aveling and Porter.

The last British Railways 0-4-0ST dock shunters were built by Horwich Works as late as 1955 and survived until 1966.

====Tender locomotives====

During the 1840s, the wheel arrangement was widely used by Edward Bury on the bar-framed locomotives built for the London and Birmingham Railway. However, with the exception of a few isolated examples used by the smaller companies such as the Cambrian Railways, the Furness Railway and the Taff Vale Railway, and four examples built by Edward Fletcher (engineer) of the North Eastern Railway between 1854 and 1868, the 0-4-0 tender locomotive had been largely superseded on Britain&#x27;s mainline railways by 1850.

===United States===

====Tank locomotives====

An early example of the 0-4-0 vertical boiler type was the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Atlantic&quot; No. 2, built in 1832 by Phineas Davis and Israel Gartner. In the United States, the 0-4-0 tank locomotive was principally used for industrial railway purposes.

A locomotive based on these also appears in &quot;Mario Kart 8&quot;&#x27;s N64 Rainbow Road and Merry Mountain tracks.
====Tender locomotives====

In the United States, the &quot;Best Friend of Charleston&quot; was the first locomotive to be built entirely within the United States. It was built in 1830 for the South Carolina Canal and Rail Road Company by the West Point Foundry of New York.

The &quot;John Bull&quot; was built by Robert Stephenson and Company for the Camden and Amboy Railroad in New Jersey in 1831, but was later rebuilt as a 2-4-0.

The Pennsylvania Railroad kept producing classes long after all other major railroads had abandoned development of the type, building their final &quot;A5s&quot; class into the 1920s. The &quot;A5s&quot; was a monster among , larger than many designs, with modern features found on few others of its type, such as superheating, power reverse, and piston valves. The Pennsy continued to build the type because it had a large amount of confined and tight industrial track, more than most other railroads had.

==0-4-0 diesel locomotives==

The wheel arrangement was also used on a number of small 0-4-0DM diesel-mechanical shunters produced by John Fowler &amp; Co. and other builders in the 1930s and earlier. Similarly, it was perpetuated on a number of diesel-mechanical and diesel-hydraulic classes between 1953 and 1960 (see the List of British Rail modern traction locomotive classes). Many of these were later sold for industrial use.

There are 0-4-0DE diesel-electric locomotives too, although small in number. The smallest diesel switchers, such as the EMD Model 40, were of this arrangement.

0-4-0 diesel-mechanical shunters are also Polish PKP class SM02 and PKP class SM03 and narrow gauge WLs40/50.

<doc id="423978" wikidata="Q745219" url="?curid=423978" title="Salve a ti, Nicaragua">
<text>&quot;&quot; (&quot;Hail to thee, Nicaragua&quot;) is the national anthem of Nicaragua. It was approved October 20, 1939, and officially adopted August 25, 1971. The lyrics were written by Salomón Ibarra Mayorga, and it was composed by Ernesto o Anselmo Castinove, with arrangement by Luis A. Delgadillo. Vocally, its key signature is an E major.

==History==
The music dates back to the 18th century, when it was used as a liturgical anthem by a Spanish monk, Fr. Ernesto o Anselmo Castinove, when the country was a province of Spain. During the initial years of independence, it was used to salute the justices of the Supreme Court of the State of Nicaragua, then a member of the Central American Federation.

The anthem was eventually replaced by three other anthems during periods of political upheaval or revolution, but it was restored on April 23, 1918 at the fall of the last liberal revolution. A contest was opened to the public, for new lyrics for the national anthem. The lyrics could only mention peace and work, as the country had just ended a civil war. As a result, the Nicaraguan state anthem is one of the only state anthems in Latin America that speaks of peace instead of war.

The new conservative, pro-Spanish government quickly awarded the first prize to Salomon Ibarra Mayorga, a Nicaraguan teacher and poet. It replaced the more warlike &quot;Hermosa Soberana&quot; (&quot;Beautiful and Sovereign&quot;), an anti-Spanish military march that was seen as an embarrassment in a country with deep Spanish roots. &quot;Hermosa Soberana&quot; was, however, adopted by the Liberal Party () as its partisan anthem from 1927 to this day.

<doc id="423981" wikidata="Q3509725" url="?curid=423981" title="Constitutional Act on the Czechoslovak Federation">
<text>The Constitutional Act on the Czechoslovak Federation (, ) was a constitutional law in Czechoslovakia adopted on 27 October 1968 and in force from 1 January 1969 to 1 January 1993. It converted the previously unitary Czechoslovak state into a federation.

==Federation==
For nearly all of its existence as an independent nation, Czechoslovakia had been a unitary state, the lone exception being the &quot;Czecho-Slovakia era&quot; immediately before World War II. The concentration of governmental authority in Prague was a source of discontent within Slovakia throughout the 1960s. As part of the Prague Spring reforms, Communist Party leader Alexander Dubček, himself a Slovak, sought to grant more autonomy to the Slovaks. Indeed, the resulting reform was virtually the only product of the Prague Spring to survive the Soviet invasion.

The promulgation of the Constitutional Law of the Federation amended fifty-eight articles of the 1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia concerning government structure. The Czechoslovak state was declared to be a federation of &quot;two equal fraternal nations,&quot; the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic, each with a national administration paralleling and, at least in theory, equal in status to the federal government. Dual citizenship was established (Article 5 (3): &quot;Every Czechoslovak citizen is at the same time a citizen of the Czech Socialist Republic or the Slovak Socialist Republic&quot;). Many of the former functions of the central government were instead placed under the jurisdiction of the two national governments. The federal government retained exclusive jurisdiction over foreign affairs, national defense, federal reserves, and national resources. It held joint jurisdiction in several other matters, but the extent of the federalization reform was sweeping.

===Federal legislature===

The most significant and lasting change under the 1968 constitutional law was the replacement of the unicameral National Assembly with a bicameral legislature known as the Federal Assembly. The two bodies, given equal authority, were the Chamber of the People, which was identical to the old National Assembly, and the Chamber of the Nations, which contained an equal number of Czechs and Slovaks. Together with a provision (Article 42) that certain decisions required the majority consent of each half (Czech and Slovak) of the Chamber of the Nations and a provision (Article 41) that constitutional amendments, organic laws, the election of the president and declarations of war required a three-fifths supermajority not only in the Chamber of the People but also of each half (Czech and Slovak) of the Chamber of the Nations, this institutional reform was designed to end Slovak fear of Czech domination of the legislative branch of the government.

==Subsequent developments==

It soon became apparent, however, that many aspects of the 1968 federalization were politically and administratively impractical. Political power remained firmly centralized in the Communist Party (proposals to federalize the party were dropped after the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia), and the administration of two economic systems, two police systems, and the like proved unworkable. As a result, July 1971 amendments to the 1968 Constitutional Law of Federation unified the administration of these and other government functions, ended the practice of dual citizenship, and, most importantly, authorized the federal government to interfere with and invalidate measures of the national governments (similarly to president&#x27;s rule in India and federal intervention in Argentina). Although most of the structures of the 1968 reform remained intact, observers of the Czechoslovak system of government in the 1970s agreed that federalism remained little more than a facade after the enactment of the 1971 constitutional amendments. In May 1975, the 1968 Constitutional Law of the Federation was further amended to allow Gustáv Husák to take over the presidency from the ailing Ludvík Svoboda.

==Velvet divorce==

The constitutional law was superseded by the new Constitution of the Czech Republic and the Constitution of the Slovak Republic that came into force on January 1, 1993, after the effectively negotiated dissolution of Czechoslovakia. The Constitutional Act on the Czechoslovak Federation hadn&#x27;t foreseen any dissolution and didn&#x27;t discuss any rights of the nations for self-determination. The Slovak National Council&#x27;s Declaration of Independence of the Slovak Nation approved in July 1992 was therefore unconstitutional – at least the planned outcomes were indisputably unconstitutional. That declaration and its conflict with the constitutional system of Czechoslovakia persuaded most Czech and Slovak politicians that negotiations about the dissolution had become unavoidable.

<text>Óscar Raymundo Benavides Larrea (March 15, 1876 – July 2, 1945) was a Peruvian field marshal, diplomat, and politician who served as the 38th (1914–1915, by coup d&#x27;état) and 42nd (1933–1939) President of Peru, with his latter term being a period of authoritarian fascism.

== Early life ==
He was born in Lima on March 15, 1876, son of Miguel Benavides y Gallegos, Sergeant Major of the National Guard, and Erfilia Larrea, Peruvian socialite. After attending the College of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Lima, Benavides entered the Military School of Lima and in 1894 the Dos de Mayo Artillery Brigade. In 1901, he was promoted to captain. In 1906, at age 30, he graduated with top grades as Sergeant Major at the Military Academy in Lima, directed by the French Military Mission. Benavides went to France to complete his military training, after which the French Republic distinguished him with the Cross of the Legion of Honor.

== Caquetá River campaign ==
Upon returning to Peru in December 1910, Benavides was designated commanding officer of Infantry Battalion N° 9, garrisoned in Chiclayo, on the Northern Pacific Coast of Peru. In February 1911, the Peruvian Government ordered Benavides to lead Battalion Nº 9 to the Northeastern border with Colombia in the Peruvian Amazon. Colombia had established a fortified post at La Pedrera on the southern bank of the Caquetá River, which, according to the Porras-Tanco Argáez Treaty of 1909, was within Peruvian territory.

Battalion N° 9 had to travel more than 2,000 kilometers, passing over the roadless Andean range at Cajamarca and Chachapoyas to the Amazonian jungle. At Balsapuerto, at the headwaters of the Huallaga River, the expedition prepared rafts and obtained canoes, traveling downstream to Yurimaguas on the Huallaga, and thence by boat to Iquitos on the Amazon River. The naval expedition, consisting of one gunboat and four boats, set out from Iquitos on June 29, 1911, four months after departing Chiclayo. On July 10 it faced La Pedrera with blazing flags. After an exchange of notes in which the Colombian Commander refused to vacate the position, Commander Benavides initiated the attack. The triumph of the Peruvian forces was complete. But on July 24, to his dismay, Commander Benavides was informed that the Peruvian and Colombian Governments had signed a treaty whereby the Peruvian forces were to abandon the Caquetá and to withdraw to the Putumayo River.

On July 28, 1911, the Peruvian forces still at La Pedrera celebrated Independence Day. But they lacked equipment to protect themselves from the climate, diseases, and infections endemic to the region. On July 29, the troops underwent a terrible epidemic of yellow fever and beriberi. Lacking medicines, the troops were cruelly decimated.

On August 4, Commander Benavides returned to Iquitos. He was promoted to the rank of Infantry Colonel; but Benavides wrote in his diary: &quot;I have suffered so much that the victory obtained and the ovations and promotion conferred on me have not gratified me in the way many assume, as they would have without so much misfortune&quot;.

The Government sent Benavides to Europe for treatment of beriberi. When he returned to Peru on April 8, 1912, he was received as a national hero, and in his honor a parade took place in Lima, along the Jirón de la Unión to the Plaza de Armas. On this occasion, he met his distant cousin Francisca Benavides Diez Canseco, whom he married a few months later. Benavides was appointed to the position of General Commander of the Third Region in Arequipa. In November 1913, Benavides was designated Head of the Army General Staff in Lima.

On July 16, 1913, he was shot in the arm in a bandit attack on his troops. He was shot again on the same day by an ally&#x27;s stray bullet. Neither of the wounds were fatal (or even near fatal), but they did diminish his fighting abilities.

== First presidential term ==

In 1913, the President of Peru was Guillermo Billinghurst, who had been elected in 1912 with the backing of workers&#x27; movements. Faced with the opposition of a significant sector of Congress, Billinghurst planned to dissolve Congress. Some Congressmen conspired to depose the President, and obtained the backing of Lieutenant Colonel José Urdanivia Ginés, head of a section of the Army General Staff. Billinghurst attempted to arm the population to fight the Armed Forces. The conspirators approached Colonel Benavides, who agreed to back them, both to defend the Constitutional order and to avoid a division of the Armed Forces (Basadre, p. 3733–3734). On February 4, 1914, the Army, under the command of Benavides, obtained from President Billinghurst a statement of willingness to negotiate. Billinghurst was deposed and exiled to Chile, where he died the following year.

As Chief of Staff, Benavides was appointed by the conspirers to preside over a Government Council. On May 15, the National Congress designated him as Provisional President. On December 17, Benavides ascended to General of Brigade (Tauro, p. 285). During the 18 months of his government, Benavides restored political order and stability. Regarding his cabinets, Basadre (p. 3772) writes: &quot;General Benavides’ choice of collaborators was cautious and balanced&quot;. Benavides called general presidential elections which were won by José Pardo y Barreda, who governed from August 18, 1915.

President Pardo sent Benavides to Paris (1916) as an observer of World War I; he was a witness at the Battle of Verdun. Subsequently (1917), Pardo sent him to Italy as Extraordinary Emissary and Plenipotentiary Minister. On July 4, 1919, Augusto B. Leguía became President of Peru as the result of a coup d´état against Pardo. In December 1920, Benavides resigned from the post in Rome and returned to Lima.

Leguía feared that Benavides would organize a revolt, and had him arrested on May 3, 1921. Benavides and twenty-five other citizens were boarded as prisoners on the &quot;Paita&quot; steamship destined to Sydney, Australia. A revolt, commanded by Benavides, captured the ship&#x27;s captain and officers, and changed the route to Costa Rica. From Costa Rica. Benavides moved to Panama and thence to Guayaquil (Ecuador) where he renewed contacts with elements opposing Leguia. In November 1927, he moved to France.

== Second presidential term ==
On August 22, 1930, Lieutenant Colonel Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro initiated a coup in Arequipa, and Leguía resigned from the Presidency. Sánchez Cerro was invested with the rank of Provisional President. On October 3, Benavides was appointed to the post of Extraordinary Emissary and Plenipotentiary Minister in Spain and, in February 1932, in England. The Government recalled Benavides and appointed him General-in-Chief of the Council of National Defense (March 27, 1932), in charge of the Peruvian forces in view of a renewed armed conflict with Colombia. On March 31, he was promoted to the rank of Division General.

Sánchez Cerro was assassinated on April 30, 1933. To restrain ensuing turmoil, the Constituent Assembly proclaimed Benavides Constitutional President of the Republic for the completion of the period initiated by Sánchez Cerro. Benavides signed the new Peruvian Constitution, which replaced that of 1920 (which had been in effect since the administration of Augusto B. Leguía). The 1933 Constitution lasted until 1979.

Benavides oversaw an authoritarian fascist regime and built a strong relationship with wealthy Peruvian business owners. The primary concerns of the new Government were: to resolve the conflict with Colombia (peace was negotiated in May 1934); and to assuage internal political agitation (Tauro, vol 1, p. 266; Orrego, p. 894) for which purpose, Benavides outlawed the Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana (APRA), arguing that it was an international party, prohibited by the Peruvian Constitution, and repressed the Communist Party for the same reason. Benavides called presidential elections in 1936; but the results were annulled as they favored the investment of Luis Antonio Eguiguren who, according to the Government, had the vote of the APRA.

Benavides obtained the extension of his mandate for three more years in 1936 after enacting authoritarian measures to maintain power. During this extension, he governed under the motto “Order, Peace, and Work.” He strengthened the Armed Forces and purchased modern armaments. The Navy Dock and Ship Dry Dock of Callao were built; the Pan-American Highway was completed from Ecuador to Chile along the Peruvian coast, as was the Central Highway crossing the Andes east from Lima to the Amazonian Forest, as far as Tingo María. Road and bridge tolls were abolished, thus implementing freedom of the highways.

The Government built living quarters and dining halls for workers and their families, and instituted Workers’ Social Security, and a new Civil Code. Tourism was encouraged and Tourist Hotels were planned for Peru’s principal cities. The National Census was planned and organized, but was only effected in 1940, by the following Government. During Benavides&#x27; term in office, the second phase of remodeling the Government Palace of Peru was initiated, as well as the &quot;Palacio de Justicia&quot; (&quot;Palace of Justice&quot;).

On December 8, 1939, Benavides handed over the presidential mandate to Manuel Prado y Ugarteche, the winner of the General Elections of that year. On December 19, Prado honored Benavides with the title of Grand Marshal of Peru.

== Foundation of the National Democratic Front ==
Benavides served as Peruvian Ambassador in Madrid (1940), and in Buenos Aires (1941–1944). He returned to Peru on July 17, 1944, and was among the founders of the Frente Democrático Nacional (FDN) (National Democratic Front). Benavides died in Lima on July 2, 1945, after the confirmation of the triumph of the FDN Presidential Candidate, José Luis Bustamante y Rivero.

<text>Hokkaido Air System (HAC) is a Japanese regional airline that operates scheduled services in Hokkaidō and Aomori Prefecture, Japan from a main base of operations at Okadama Airport in Higashi-ku, Sapporo. As of June 30, 2023, the airline is owned by Japan Airlines (57,3%), Hokkaido Prefecture (19,5%), Sapporo City (13,5%) and 16 other shareholders (9,7%).

== History ==

The airline was established in 1997, and started operations in 1998. Founded as a joint venture with the Hokkaido government and regional municipalities and businesses, it was an affiliate of Japan Air System until that airline consolidated into Japan Airlines. Its headquarters were at one time located in the Terminal Building of New Chitose Airport in Chitose, Hokkaidō, Japan.

HAC&#x27;s initial routes in 1998 were Chitose-Hakodate, Hakodate-Asahikawa, Hakodate-Kushiro and Asahikawa-Kushiro, followed by Chitose-Kushiro and Hakodate-Memanbetsu in 1999 and Hakodate-Sendai in 2001. It began Okadama service in 2003 with service to Hakodate and Kushiro, for a total of nine routes. HAC also served Monbetsu from Chitose and Okadama in 2005–06. Air Hokkaido ceased operations on 31 March 2006 and its sole route, Hakodate-Okushiri, was taken over the next day by Hokkaido Air System.

HAC left the Japan Airlines group at the end of fiscal year 2010 (March 2011) as part of the corporate restructuring of JAL. JAL retained a 14% stake in the airline, making it the second-largest shareholder after the Hokkaido prefectural government. Japan Airlines ceased ticket handling and reservation services for HAC flights effective September 1, 2011. The Hokkaido prefectural government and various local governments continued to subsidize HAC services to various smaller cities in the prefecture.

HAC recorded losses of 296 million yen and had negative equity of 116 million yen in the fiscal year ending March 2013, and took several measures to improve its performance, including resuming codesharing with JAL and starting service from Sapporo to Misawa in July 2013. It was revealed in August 2013 that Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers in the Hokkaido government had been pushing JAL to once again take over HAC. As of December, JAL and the Hokkaido government were reportedly in negotiations to make HAC a subsidiary of JAL, as part of which JAL and Hokkaido government would each pay off half of HAC&#x27;s excess debt, with the Hokkaido government possibly doing so by cancelling part of its 360 million yen loan claim against the airline. The transaction was announced in October 2014. In October 2016, HAC consolidated its flight numbers and reservations system with the JAL group.

<doc id="423986" wikidata="Q672593" url="?curid=423986" title="Wheel arrangement">
<text>In rail transport, a wheel arrangement or wheel configuration is a system of classifying the way in which wheels are distributed under a locomotive. Several notations exist to describe the wheel assemblies of a locomotive by type, position, and connections, with the adopted notations varying by country. Within a given country, different notations may also be employed for different kinds of locomotives, such as steam, electric, and diesel powered.

Especially in steam days, wheel arrangement was an important attribute of a locomotive because there were many different types of layout adopted, each wheel being optimised for a different use (often with only some being actually &quot;driven&quot;). Modern diesel and electric locomotives are much more uniform, usually with all axles driven.

==Major notation schemes==
The main notations are the Whyte notation (based on counting the wheels), the AAR wheel arrangement notation (based on counting either the axles or the bogies), and the UIC classification of locomotive axle arrangements (based on counting either the axles or the bogies).

The Whyte notation is generally used for steam locomotives throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland. For diesels and electrics, North America uses the AAR wheel arrangement scheme while British practice uses a slightly simplified form of the European UIC classification scheme (except for small diesel shunters, where Whyte notation is used).

In mainland Europe, the UIC classification scheme is generally used for all locomotive types including steam, with some exceptions. In France, the UIC classification is used for diesels and electrics while a scheme similar to the Whyte notation, but counting axles instead of wheels, is used for steam locomotives. Notably, Switzerland had its own separate notation system until 1989, with the Swiss locomotive and railcar classification now only retained for its narrow-gauge railways.

*AAR wheel arrangement - Used largely throughout the US and Canada for diesel and electric locomotives.
*UIC classification - Used in mainland Europe for all locomotive types. Used in the UK for electric and large diesel locomotives.
*Whyte notation - Used in North America, the UK and Ireland for steam locomotives, and for shunter locomotives (US: switcher locomotives) in the UK.

== Comparison of wheel arrangements and wheel picture ==

== Geared steam locomotives ==

Geared steam locomotives such as Shays, Heislers, and Climaxes do not have a standard wheel arrangement classification system. Instead of being classified by wheel arrangement, they are instead classified by their design and their number of trucks.

<doc id="423994" wikidata="Q438330" url="?curid=423994" title="Jo Walton">
<text>Jo Walton (born 1964) is a Welsh-Canadian fantasy and science fiction writer and poet. She is best known for the fantasy novel &quot;Among Others&quot;, which won the Hugo and Nebula Awards in 2012, and &quot;Tooth and Claw&quot;, a Victorian-era novel with dragons which won the World Fantasy Award in 2004. Other works by Walton include the &quot;Small Change&quot; series, in which she blends alternate history with the cozy mystery genre, comprising &quot;Farthing&quot;, &quot;Ha&#x27;penny&quot; and &quot;Half a Crown&quot;. Her fantasy novel &quot;Lifelode&quot; won the 2010 Mythopoeic Award, and her alternate history &quot;My Real Children&quot; received the 2015 Tiptree Award.

Walton is also known for her non-fiction, including book reviews and SF commentary in the magazine &quot;Tor.com&quot;. A collection of her articles were published in &quot;What Makes This Book So Great&quot; (2014), which won the Locus Award for Best Non-Fiction.

== Background ==
Walton was born in 1964 in Aberdare, a town in the Cynon Valley of Wales. She went to Park School in Aberdare, then Aberdare Girls&#x27; Grammar School. She lived for a year in Cardiff, went to Howell&#x27;s School, Llandaff and finished her education at Oswestry School in Shropshire and at the Lancaster University. She lived in London for two years and lived in Lancaster until 1997. She then moved to Swansea, where she lived until she moved to Canada in 2002.

Walton speaks Welsh: &quot;It&#x27;s the second language of my family of origin, my grandmother was a well known Welsh scholar and translator, I studied it in school from five to sixteen, I have a ten-year-old&#x27;s fluency on grammar and vocab but no problem whatsoever with pronunciation.&quot;

== Writing career ==
Walton has been writing since she was 13, but her first novel was not published until 2000. Before that, she had been published in a number of role-playing game publications, such as &quot;Pyramid&quot;, mostly in collaboration with her husband at the time, Ken Walton, co-founder of the Cakebread &amp; Walton games company. Walton was also active in online science fiction fandom, especially in the Usenet groups rec.arts.sf.written and rec.arts.sf.fandom. Her poem &quot;The Lurkers Support Me in E-Mail&quot; is widely quoted on it and in other online arguments, often without her name attached.

Walton&#x27;s first three novels, &quot;The King&#x27;s Peace&quot; (2000), &quot;The King&#x27;s Name&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Prize in the Game&quot; (2002), were all fantasy and set in the same world, which is based on Arthurian Britain and the Táin Bó Cúailnge&#x27;s Ireland. She won the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in 2002. Her next novel, &quot;Tooth and Claw&quot; (2003), was intended as a novel Anthony Trollope could have written, but about dragons rather than humans.

&quot;Farthing&quot; was her first science fiction novel, placing the genre of the cozy mystery firmly inside an alternative history in which the United Kingdom made peace with Adolf Hitler before the involvement of the United States in World War II. It was nominated for a Nebula Award, a Quill Award, the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for best science fiction novel, and the Sidewise Award for Alternate History. A sequel, &quot;Ha&#x27;penny&quot;, was published in October 2007, with the final book in the trilogy, &quot;Half a Crown,&quot; published in September 2008. &quot;Ha&#x27;penny&quot; won the 2008 Prometheus Award (jointly with Harry Turtledove&#x27;s novel &quot;The Gladiator&quot;) and has been nominated for the Lambda Literary Award.

In April 2007, Howard V. Hendrix stated that professional writers should never release their writings online for free, as this made them equivalent to scabs. Walton responded to this by declaring 23 April as International Pixel-Stained Technopeasant Day, a day in which writers who disagreed with Hendrix could release their stories online en masse. In 2008 Walton celebrated this day by posting several chapters of an unfinished sequel to &quot;Tooth and Claw&quot;, &quot;Those Who Favor Fire.&quot;

In 2008, Walton began writing an online column for Tor.com, mostly retrospective reviews of older books. A collection of these blog posts were published in &quot;What Makes This Book So Great&quot; (2014). She also wrote a series of articles revisiting the Hugo award nominees for each year from 1953 to 2000, which were later collected as &quot;An Informal History of the Hugos&quot; (2018).

Her book, &quot;Among Others&quot; (2012), won several awards, including both the Hugo Award for Best Novel and Nebula Award for Best Novel. Her recent works include the alternate history &quot;My Real Children&quot; (2014), which won the Tiptree Award; the &quot;Thessaly&quot; trilogy (2015–16), a science fiction/fantasy series involving the Greek Gods and a re-imagining of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;; and the historical fantasy &quot;Lent&quot; (2019), set in Renaissance Italy. Her 2020 novel &quot;Or What You Will&quot; is a metafictional novel about immortality and creativity, featuring an ageing fantasy novelist writing a book set in Renaissance Florence.

In February 2018, Walton was the Literary/Fan Guest of Honor and Keynote Speaker at the 36th annual Life, the Universe, &amp; Everything professional science fiction and fantasy arts symposium.

In November 2022, Walton released her original audio drama &quot;Heart&#x27;s Home&quot;, based on a Welsh folk tale, with Odyssey Theatre as part of &quot;The Other Path&quot; podcast.

==Awards==

==Personal life==
Walton moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, after her first novel was published. She is married to Emmet A. O&#x27;Brien. She has one child.
