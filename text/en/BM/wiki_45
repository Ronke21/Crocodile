<text>Charles Wilkes (April 3, 1798 – February 8, 1877) was an American naval officer, ship&#x27;s captain, and explorer. He led the United States Exploring Expedition (1838–1842).

During the American Civil War between 1861 and 1865, he commanded &quot;&quot; during the Trent Affair in which he stopped a Royal Mail ship and removed two Confederate diplomats, which almost led to war between the United States and the United Kingdom.

==Early life and career==

Wilkes was born in New York City, on April 3, 1798, the great nephew of the former Lord Mayor of London John Wilkes. His mother was Mary Seton, who died in 1802 when Charles was just three years old. As a result, Charles was raised and home tutored by his aunt, Elizabeth Ann Seton, who was fluent in French from her own upbringing in New Rochelle, New York on a French Huguenots settlement. Charles became himself fluent, which served him throughout his career, including in dealing with officials during an extended stay in Europe in 1830 and 1831. His fluency was also demonstrated during his exploration of Puget Sound in 1841 with French-speaking guide Simon Plamondon.

Seton later converted to Roman Catholicism, becoming the first American-born woman canonized a saint by the Catholic Church. When Elizabeth was left widowed with five children, Charles was sent to a boarding school, and later attended Columbia College, which is the present-day Columbia University.

==Career==
Wilkes entered the United States Navy as a midshipman in 1818, and became a lieutenant in 1826.

In 1833, for his survey of Narragansett Bay, he was placed in charge of the Navy&#x27;s Department of Charts and Instruments, out of which developed the Naval Observatory and Hydrographic Office. Wilkes&#x27; interdisciplinary expedition (1838–1842) set a physical oceanography benchmark for the office&#x27;s first superintendent Matthew Fontaine Maury.

He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1843.

==Columbian Institute==
During the 1820s, Wilkes was a member of the prestigious Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, which counted among its members presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams and many prominent men of the day, including well-known representatives of the military, government service, medical, and other professions.

==South Seas expedition==


In 1838, although not yet a seasoned naval line officer, Wilkes was experienced in nautical survey work, and was working with civilian scientists. Upon this background, he was given command of the government exploring expedition &quot;... for the purpose of exploring and surveying the Southern Ocean... as well to determine the existence of all doubtful islands and shoals, as to discover, and accurately fix, the position of those which [lay] in or near the track of our vessels in that quarter, and [might] have escaped the observation of scientific navigators.&quot; The US Exploring Squadron was authorized by act of the Congress on May 18, 1836.

The Exploring Expedition, commonly known as the Wilkes Expedition, included naturalists, botanists, a mineralogist, taxidermists, artists, and a philologist, and it was carried by &#x27; (780 tons) and &#x27; (650 tons), the brig &#x27; (230 tons), the store-ship &#x27;, and two schooners, &#x27; (110 tons) and &#x27; (96 tons).

Departing from Hampton Roads on August 18, 1838, the expedition stopped at the Madeira Islands and Rio de Janeiro; visited Tierra del Fuego, Chile, Peru, the Tuamotu Archipelago, Samoa, and New South Wales; from Sydney sailed into the Antarctic Ocean in December 1839 and reported the discovery &quot;of an Antarctic continent west of the Balleny Islands&quot; of which it sighted the coast on January 25, 1840. After charting 1500 miles of Antarctic coastline, the expedition visited Fiji and the Hawaiian Islands. In Fiji, the expedition kidnapped the chief Ro Veidovi, charging him with the murder of a crew of American whalers. And, in July 1840, two sailors, one of whom was Wilkes&#x27; nephew, Midshipman Wilkes Henry, were killed while bartering for food on Fiji&#x27;s Malolo Island. Wilkes&#x27; retribution was swift and severe. According to an old man from Malolo Island, nearly 80 Fijians were killed in the incident.

From December 1840 to March 1841, he employed hundreds of native Hawaiian porters and many of his men to haul a pendulum to the summit of Mauna Loa to measure gravity. Instead of using the existing trail, he blazed his own way, taking much longer than he anticipated. The conditions on the mountain reminded him of Antarctica. Many of his crew suffered snow blindness, altitude sickness and foot injuries from wearing out their shoes.

He explored the west coast of North America, including the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Puget Sound, the Columbia River, San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento River, in 1841. He held the first American Independence Day celebration west of the Mississippi River in Dupont, Washington, on July 5, 1841. The United States Exploring Expedition passed through the Ellice Islands and visited Funafuti, Nukufetau and Vaitupu in 1841. The expedition returned by way of the Philippines, the Sulu Archipelago, Borneo, Singapore, Polynesia and the Cape of Good Hope, reaching New York on June 10, 1842.

After having completely encircled the globe as the last all-sail naval mission to do so, Wilkes had logged some 87,000 miles and lost two ships and 28 men. Wilkes was court-martialed upon his return for the loss of one of his ships on the Columbia River bar, for the regular mistreatment of his subordinate officers, and for excessive punishment of his sailors. A major witness against him was ship doctor Charles Guillou. He was acquitted on all charges except illegally punishing men in his squadron. For a short time, he was attached to the Coast Survey, but from 1844 to 1861, he was chiefly engaged in preparing the report of the expedition.

His &quot;Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition&quot; (5 volumes and an atlas) was published in 1844. He edited the scientific reports of the expedition (19 volumes and 11 atlases, 1844–1874) and was the author of Vol. XI (Meteorology) and Vol. XXIII (Hydrography). Alfred Thomas Agate, engraver and illustrator, was the designated portrait and botanical artist of the expedition. His work was used to illustrate the &quot;Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition&quot;. The &quot;Narrative&quot; contains much interesting material concerning the manners, customs, political and economic conditions in many places then little known. Wilkes&#x27; 1841 Map of the Oregon Territory pre-dated John Charles Fremont&#x27;s first Oregon Trail pathfinder expedition guided by Kit Carson during 1842.

Other valuable contributions were the three reports of James Dwight Dana on &quot;Zoophytes&quot; (1846), &quot;Geology&quot; (1849) and &quot;Crustacea&quot; (1852–1854). Moreover, the specimens and artifacts brought back by expedition scientists ultimately formed the foundation for the Smithsonian Institution collection. In addition to many shorter articles and reports, Wilkes published the major scientific works &quot;Western America, including California and Oregon&quot; in 1849 and &quot;Voyage round the world: embracing the principal events of the narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition in one volume: illustrated with one hundred and seventy-eight engravings on wood&quot; in 1849, and &quot;Theory of the Winds&quot; in 1856.

==Civil War==

Wilkes was promoted to the rank of commander in 1843 and that of captain in 1855. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, he was assigned to the command of &#x27; to search for the Confederate commerce destroyer &#x27;.

===&quot;Trent&quot; Affair===

As part of these duties, he visited the British colony of Bermuda in 1861. Acting on orders, Wilkes remained in port for nearly a week aboard his flagship&quot;, , violating the British rule that allowed American naval vessels (of either side) to remain in port for only a single day. While Wilkes remained in port, his gunboats &#x27; and &#x27; blockaded Saint George&#x27;s harbor, a key Confederate blockade runner base. The gunboats opened fire at the &quot;RMS&quot; &quot;Merlin&quot;.

When Wilkes learned that James Murray Mason and John Slidell, two Confederate commissioners (to Britain and France, respectively), were bound for England on a British packet boat, &quot;&quot;, he ordered the steam frigate &quot;San Jacinto&quot; to stop them. On November 8, 1861, &quot;San Jacinto&quot; met &quot;Trent&quot; and fired two shots across its bow, forcing the ship to stop. A party from &quot;San Jacinto&quot; led by its captain then boarded &quot;Trent&quot; and arrested Mason and Slidell, a further violation of British neutrality. The diplomats were taken to Fort Warren in Boston Harbor.

The actions of &quot;The Notorious Wilkes,&quot; as Bermuda media branded him, were contrary to maritime law and convinced many that full-scale war between the United States and England was inevitable.

He was officially thanked by Congress &quot;for his brave, adroit and patriotic conduct&quot;. However, his action was later disavowed by President Lincoln due to diplomatic protests by the British government (Mason and Slidell were released). His next service was in the James River flotilla and he was placed on the retired list on December 21, 1861. Subsequently, after reaching the rank of commodore on July 16, 1862, he was assigned to duty against blockade runners in the West Indies.

===West Indies Squadron===
As commander of the West Indies Squadron, Wilkes repeatedly complained of having an insufficient force, and he twice seconded to his own fleet ships ordered to other duties, even in spite of direct orders to release them. Though he had a degree of success in the capture of blockade runners, in which he profited personally, he drew criticism for failing in his primary task, the capture of the commerce raiders &quot;CSS Alabama&quot; and &quot;CSS Florida&quot;. He also repeatedly exacerbated diplomatic relations with the British, Spanish, Dutch, French, Danes and Mexicans through his arrogant and illegal activities in the West Indies and Bermuda. In violation of international law regarding belligerent nations, he established coal depots on a number of neutral islands and frequently illegally hovered outside of neutral ports. The British accused him of establishing virtual blockades of the ports of Nassau and St. George&#x27;s, where his arrogant behavior even led to suspicions that he had been sent to intentionally insult the British, while the French similarly accused him of effectively blockading Martinique.

Wilkes justified his actions by calling the ports little short of operational bases for blockade runners. His capture of ships such as the &quot;Peterhoff&quot;, &quot;Dolphin&quot;, &quot;Springbok&quot;, and &quot;Victor&quot; resulted in diplomatic remonstrations explicitly directed against Wilkes. He was recalled from his West Indies command in June 1863, a consequence of multiple factors. His failure to capture the Confederate commerce raiders certainly played a role, and his retention of the &quot;USS Vanderbilt&quot; in direct contravention of explicit orders to release it to independently hunt the &quot;Alabama&quot; served as a justification, but he probably owed his removal primarily to the seeming never-ending stream of complaints from neutral nations over his actions.

===Court martial===
Though supported by him in many of his actions in the West Indies, Wilkes frequently found himself in open conflict with Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles. Welles had recommended that Wilkes had been too old to receive the rank of commodore under the act then governing promotions.

When Welles severely criticized Wilkes in his December 1863 annual report over his retention of the &quot;Vanderbilt&quot;, Wilkes wrote a scathing response that found its way into the newspapers. A court of inquiry accused Wilkes of responsibility for its publication, and he was brought before a March 1864 court martial, facing charges of disobedience of orders, insubordination, disrespect of a superior officer, disobedience of naval regulations, and conduct unbecoming an officer. He was found guilty of all charges and sentenced to public reprimand and suspension for three years. However, Lincoln reduced the suspension to one year, and the balance of charges were dropped. On July 25, 1866, he was promoted to the rank of rear admiral on the retired list.

==Later life==

One historian speculated that Wilkes&#x27; obsessive behavior and harsh code of shipboard discipline shaped Herman Melville&#x27;s characterization of Captain Ahab in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;. Such speculation is not mentioned in the United States Navy historical archives.

In addition to his contribution to United States naval history and scientific study in his official &quot;Narrative of the Exploration Squadron&quot; (6 volumes), Wilkes wrote his autobiography.

Wilkes died in Washington, D.C., with the rank of Rear Admiral. In August 1909, the United States moved his remains to Arlington National Cemetery. His gravestone says that &quot;He discovered the Ant-arctic continent.&quot; &quot;sic&quot;

<text>The Church of God, House of Prayer is a Holiness Pentecostal body of Christians.

==History==
The Church of God, House of Prayer, founded in 1939 by Harrison W. Poteat and incorporated in 1966, is doctrinally similar to the &quot;Church of God (Cleveland)&quot;. They are Trinitarian and Arminian in theology, holding a premillennial view of eschatology. Other beliefs include the baptism of the Holy Ghost, evidenced by glossolalia; water baptism by immersion; the Lord&#x27;s supper and feet washing for believers only; and that the atonement provides not only for spiritual rebirth, but also for healing and deliverance from evil spirits.

==Organization==
In 1979, the Church of God, House of Prayer had 24 churches in the eastern United States, and 2 churches in eastern Canada. The estimated membership was 1200. Local congregations are &quot;integral parts&quot; of the General Assembly of the Church of God, House of Prayer, and are subject to the General Assembly and its officials. Headquarters are in Markleysburg, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="417615" wikidata="Q4892947" url="?curid=417615" title="Bernard Braine">
<text>Bernard Richard Braine, Baron Braine of Wheatley, PC (24 June 1914 – 5 January 2000) was a Conservative Party politician in the United Kingdom. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for 42 years, from 1950 to 1992, representing constituencies in Essex.

==Early life==
He was educated at Hendon County Grammar School, and served with the North Staffordshire Regiment in the Second World War, rising to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel.

==Political career==
In 1948, Braine opposed GATT, arguing that it limited imperial preference.

Having stood unsuccessfully for Leyton East in 1945, Braine was elected as MP for Billericay at the 1950 general election. When constituency boundaries were revised for the 1955 election he was returned for the new South East Essex constituency, and when that constituency was abolished for the 1983 general election, he was elected for the new Castle Point constituency, becoming Father of the House of Commons in 1987 after James Callaghan&#x27;s elevation to the House of Lords.

During his long parliamentary career, Braine served as a junior Minister variously for Pensions, Commonwealth Relations and Health.

He was chairman of the National Council on Alcoholism, and author of the report &quot;Alcohol and Work&quot; (1977), widely known as the Braine Report. He was a member of the Parliamentary Groups on Human Rights and against abortion. For many years he served as an unofficial ambassador of HM&#x27;s government to the Polish Government-in-Exile in London. He was knighted in the 1972 New Year Honours, and appointed as a Privy Counsellor in 1985.

Braine championed many causes involving oppressed people. Among them was the Campaign for the Defence of the Unjustly Prosecuted, of which he was President and later Chairman during 1980–1987. In this capacity and in collaboration with the exiled journalist Josef Josten, he campaigned vigorously for the release from prison of the dissident playwright Vaclav Havel, who later became President of the Czech Republic. He was decorated by Havel at a ceremony in Prague Castle on 28 October 1995.

==Later life==
Braine stepped down from Parliament at the 1992 general election, and on 10 August that year he was made a life peer as Baron Braine of Wheatley, &quot;of Rayleigh in the County of Essex&quot;. He died in January 2000 at the age of 85.

<text>Little Missenden is a village and civil parish on the River Misbourne in Buckinghamshire, England. It is in the Chiltern Hills, about southeast of Great Missenden and west of Amersham. The village lies on the River Misbourne in the Misbourne valley.

The parish includes the villages of Holmer Green, Hyde Heath and Little Kingshill, and the hamlets of Beamond End, Brays Green, Mop End and Spurlands End. The 2011 Census recorded the population of the ward of Little Missenden, which includes Hyde Heath and Little Kingshill, as 2,234, albeit those other two villages in the ward are each larger than Little Missenden itself. The population of the entire parish was estimated as 6,490 in 2017, reflecting the inclusion of the much larger Holmer Green within the parish.

The main London – Aylesbury road used to run through the centre of Little Missenden and past the two pubs – The Red Lion and The Crown. Early in the 19th century a new by-pass road was built to the north and this now forms part of the modern A413 road.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Missenden&quot; is first attested in the Domesday Book as &quot;Missedene&quot;, with other early attestations including the spellings &quot;Messedena&quot; and &quot;Musindone&quot;. The &quot;-den&quot; element probably comes from Old English &quot;denu&quot;, meaning &quot;valley&quot;, but the etymology of the first element is uncertain. It is thought to occur in the name of the River Misbourne, which rises in Great Missenden, and also in the Hertfordshire place-name Miswell. Frank Stenton and Allen Mawer guessed that it came from a hypothetical Anglo-Saxon personal name &quot;Myrsa&quot;, which they also supposed to be found in the name of Mursley. 

Eilert Ekwall suggested that the name &quot;Missenden&quot; came from a lost Old English word related to English &quot;moss&quot;, and to Danish &quot;mysse&quot; and Swedish &quot;missne&quot; (which denote plants of the genus &quot;Calla&quot;, such as water arum). Recent researchers have tentatively preferred Ekwall&#x27;s guess, in which case the name &quot;Missenden&quot; would once have meant something like &quot;valley where water-plants/marsh-plants grow&quot;.

==Manors==
The Domesday Book of 1086 records &quot;Missedene&quot; without distinguishing the two villages, but three manors of Little Missenden are identifiable as having existed by the reign of King Edward the Confessor (1042–66). William the Conqueror granted one hide of land around what is now Town Farm to his half-brother Robert, Count of Mortain. After Domesday it evolved as the manor of Holmer, whence the hamlet of Holmer Green arose.

The manor of Mantle was half a hide and was held by the Mantle family.. Another half-hide in Little Missenden had been held by Wulfwig, Bishop of Dorchester, but by 1086 was held by Hugh de Bolebec.

By the early 14th century a fourth manor, Beamond, had emerged, probably from part of the Mortains&#x27; manor. It was held by the Augustinian Bicester priory until 1536, when it surrendered its estates to the Crown in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Its name survives in Beamond End.
The current Little Missenden Manor house originated in the 16th century as a late medieval timber-framed hall house. In the 17th century it was extended in red brick, and retains gables and a staircase from that period. The house was refaced in the 18th century. The Manor House has been Grade II listed since 1958 as a &quot;timber framed 2 storey C16 with modern cement infill&quot;.

Missenden House, a red and grey brick building, has been Grade II listed since 1958 as Missenden House, Trout Hollow and East Wing. The listing indicates that it was completed in 1729, with an east wing added in the 19th century.
Little Missenden Abbey is a Tudor Revival mansion, Grade II listed since 1987, as a &quot;country house on the site of a medieval Augustinian Abbey ... founded in 1133&quot;. The listing indicates that the abbey was modified into a mansion ca.1600, when it was owned by the Fleetwood family. Additional modifications were made when subsequent owners acquired the property in 1787 (James Oldham) and in 1815 (John Ayton). In the 21st century, the mansion was being used as a conference and training facility, and as a wedding venue, after an extensive renovation completed in 1988, necessitated by a fire that occurred in 1985.

A history of the community, published in 1908, offers this description of it in that era:The village consists of a few small houses of the 18th century, of brick and rough-cast, and some cottages. Of late a number of week-end cottages have been erected in the parish. The manor house has some remains of 17th-century work, but was modernized in the early part of the 19th century and later. The house called &#x27;Little Missenden Abbey,&#x27; the residence of Mr. E. Callard, possibly incorporates the remains of an old house.

==Parish church==

The Church of England parish church of St John the Baptist is a flint building with limestone dressings. It has been Grade I listed since 1958. The listing includes this information:C10 or C11 Anglo-Saxon core, C12 arcades, early English chancel, early C14 north chapel, C15 timber framed porch and west tower. Exterior of south aisle brick, C18. Flint with limestone dressings, some roughcast. Old tile roofs, aisles lead roofed. Modern vestry to north in C18 style, roughcast, hipped tiled roof ...

Other sources provide more specifics. The nave is 10th-century Saxon, built about AD 975. Its plain chancel arch is also Saxon and its imposts are re-used Roman bricks. The aisles, with their Norman arcades, were added in the 12th century: the south first, and the north slightly later. The Aylesbury-style font is also 12th century.

The chancel is now Early English, having been rebuilt in the 13th century. The north chapel was added early in the 14th century. The west tower and timber-framed south porch are 15th-century.

The exterior of the south aisle was rebuilt in brick in the 18th century. On the north side of the church is a modern vestry designed in 18th-century style by Quinlan Terry. The church is a Grade I listed building.
Inside the nave are several Mediæval wall paintings. Most are 13th-century, including a large Saint Christopher in the customary position opposite the south door. Also 13th-century are the paintings of the Martyrdom of St Catherine, Passion of Christ, Crucifixion of Christ, and Archangel Gabriel. There are also 14th-century paintings of the Nativity of Christ and Christ in Majesty, and a 15th-century painting of the Seven deadly sins.

The wall paintings were whitewashed in the 16th century in the English Reformation. In 1931 they were rediscovered and Prof. EW Tristram was called in to uncover and restore them. One painting eluded Tristram: A Doom painting in the customary position over the chancel arch at the east end of the nave. In 2017 traces of a 14th-century Doom were finally discovered, over the chancel arch, hidden behind old plaster.

The west tower has a ring of six bells. John Rufford of Toddington, Bedfordshire cast the third bell in about 1380. The successor of John Danyell of London cast the fourth bell in about 1470. Joseph Carter of Reading, Berkshire cast the fifth bell in 1603. Ellis II and Henry III Knight of Reading cast the tenor bell in 1663. John Warner &amp; Sons of Cripplegate, London cast the second bell in 1881. That made a ring of five until 1948, when Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the present treble bell.

==Culture==
The village has been used in many films and television programmes over the years, particularly as one of the more frequent ITV &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; filming locations. &quot;Missenden Murders&quot; was considered as a possible title for the series. The Red Lion pub has appeared in three episodes. A house in the village was used for long shots of the home of Barnes Wallis in &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; (his real house was in Effingham, Surrey). Little Missenden became the village of Blandley in the 1963 film &quot;Nurse on Wheels&quot; by Gerald Thomas and Peter Rodgers.

Little Missenden hosts comedy and arts festivals. The children of Little Missenden primary school performed the premiere of John Tavener&#x27;s &quot;Celtic Requiem&quot; in 1970 and continue to perform annually at the Little Missenden Festival of Music and Arts. Tavener wrote &quot;Little Missenden Calm&quot; for the festival in 1984.

<doc id="417622" wikidata="Q157798" url="?curid=417622" title="Watchmaker">
<text>A watchmaker is an artisan who makes and repairs watches. Since a majority of watches are now factory-made, most modern watchmakers only repair watches. However, originally they were master craftsmen who built watches, including all their parts, by hand. Modern watchmakers, when required to repair older watches, for which replacement parts may not be available, must have fabrication skills, and can typically manufacture replacements for many of the parts found in a watch. The term clockmaker refers to an equivalent occupation specializing in clocks.

Most practising professional watchmakers service current or recent production watches. They seldom fabricate replacement parts. Instead they obtain and fit factory spare parts applicable to the watch brand being serviced. The majority of modern watchmakers, particularly in Switzerland and other countries in Europe, work directly for the watchmaking industry and may have completed a formal watchmaking degree at a technical school. They also receive in-house &quot;brand&quot; training at the factory or service center where they are employed. However, some factory service centers have an approach that allows them to use &#x27;non-watchmakers&#x27; (called &quot;opérateurs&quot;) who perform only one aspect of the repair process. These highly skilled workers do not have a watchmaking degree or certificate, but are specifically trained &#x27;in-house&#x27; as technicians to service a small number of components of the watch in a true &#x27;assembly-line&#x27; fashion, (e.g., one type of worker will dismantle the watch movement from the case, another will polish the case and bracelet, another will install the dial and hands, etc.). If genuine watchmakers are employed in such environments, they are usually employed to service the watch movement.

Due to factory/genuine spare parts restrictions, an increasing minority of watchmakers in the US are &#x27;independent,&#x27; meaning that they choose not to work directly for industry or at a factory service center. One major Swiss watch brandRolexnow pre-qualifies independent watchmakers before they provide them with spare parts. This qualification may include, but is not limited to, holding a modern training certificate from one of several reputable schools; having a workshop environment that meets Rolex&#x27;s standards for cleanliness; using modern equipment; and being a member of the American Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute. The Omega brand has the same approach. However, the vast majority of modern Swiss brands do not sell parts to independent watchmakers, irrespective of the watchmaker&#x27;s expertise, training or credentials. This industry policy is thought to enable Swiss manufacturers to maintain tighter quality control of the after-sales service for its watch brands, produce high margins on after sales services (two to four times what an independent watchmaker would ask), and to reduce the availability of second-hand watchmaking parts on the used and fake market.

==Training==
Historically, in England, watchmakers would have to undergo a seven-year apprenticeship and then join a guild, such as the &quot;Worshipful Company of Clockmakers&quot; in London, before selling their first watch. In modern times, watchmakers undergo training courses such as the ones offered by the BHI, or one of the many other schools around the world following the WOSTEP style curriculum. Some US watchmaking schools of horology will teach not only the Wostep style, including the ETA range of movements, but also focus on the older watches that a modern watchmaker will encounter on a daily basis. In Denmark the apprenticeship lasts four years, with six terms at the Danish School of Watchmaking in Ringsted. The education covers both clocks and watches, as a watchmaker in Denmark is also a clockmaker. In France, there are three diplomas: the lowest is the &quot;Certificat d&#x27;aptitude professionnelle&quot; (CAP) in horology (in two years), then the &quot;Brevet des Métiers d&#x27;Art&quot; horology for another two-year course. And optionally, the &quot;Diplôme des métiers d&#x27;art&quot; / DMA Horlogerie (two years).

== Watchmaker as metaphor ==

William Paley and others used the watchmaker in his famous analogy to imply the existence of God (the teleological argument) .

Richard Dawkins later applied this analogy in his book &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot;, arguing that evolution is blind in that it cannot look forward.
==In popular culture==
Alan Moore in his graphic novel &quot;Watchmen&quot;, uses the metaphor of the watchmaker as a central part of the backstory of his heroic character Dr. Manhattan.

In the NBC television series &quot;Heroes&quot;, the villain Sylar is a watchmaker by trade. His ability to know how watches work corresponds to his ability to gain new superpowers by examining the brains of people he has murdered.

In the scifi novel &quot;The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye&quot; by Larry Niven, the Watchmakers are a small technologically intelligent sub-species of the Moties that will repair/improve things left for them (accompanied by food as payment).

In the 2015 major motion picture film &quot;Survivor&quot; directed by James McTeigue, one of the world&#x27;s most wanted killers is played by Pierce Brosnan, who demonstrates just how devastating the precision skill sets of a watchmaker can be as he plays the role of &#x27;Nash,&#x27; a professional killer who excels at bomb making and long-range shooting.

In the film &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;, Juror 11 is a watchmaker. Like most of the jurors, his job reflects how he views the case, approaching the facts very methodically and keeping everything in order. It also reflects his status as a European immigrant, a fact commented on by Juror 12.

<text>Ross () is an area of Scotland. It was first recorded in the tenth century as a province. It was claimed by the Scottish crown in 1098, and from the 12th century Ross was an earldom. From 1661 there was a county of Ross, also known as Ross-shire, covering most but not all of the province, in particular excluding Cromartyshire. Cromartyshire was subsequently merged with the county of Ross in 1889 to form the county of Ross and Cromarty. The area is now part of the Highland council area.

The western and eastern parts of Ross are known as Wester Ross and Easter Ross. Wester Ross is sparsely populated, containing part of the Northwest Highlands mountains and having extensive sea lochs along its coast onto the Minch. Easter Ross has a coast onto the Moray Firth. Ross&#x27;s main towns are Dingwall (which was the county town of Ross-shire), Cromarty, Fortrose, Invergordon and Tain, all of which lie on its eastern coast. Cromarty and Fortrose are on the Black Isle peninsula.

Ross gave its name to the medieval Diocese of Ross, which was based at Fortrose Cathedral. The name Ross is still used by the Church of Scotland for the Presbytery of Ross.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Ross&quot; may derive from a Gaelic word meaning &quot;headland&quot;, perhaps a reference to the Black Isle. Another possible origin is the West Norse word for Orkney – &quot;Hrossey&quot; – meaning &quot;horse island&quot;.

== History ==
Excavations of a rock shelter and shell midden at Sand, Applecross on the coast of Wester Ross have shown that the coast was occupied by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers.

Ptolemy&#x27;s 2nd century &quot;Geography&quot; lists a tribe called the Decantae occupying the area that would later become Easter Ross. It may be doubted whether the Romans ever effected even a temporary settlement in the area of the modern county. In Roman times, and for long afterwards, the land was occupied by Picts, who, in the 6th and 7th centuries, were converted to Christianity by followers of Saint Columba. Throughout the next three centuries the natives were continually harassed by Norwegian Viking raiders, of whose presence tokens have survived in several place-names (Dingwall, Tain, and others). At this time the country formed part of the Province of Moray (Latin: &quot;Moravia&quot;), which then extended as far as the Dornoch Firth and the River Oykel.
The principal relics of antiquity - mainly stone circles, cairns and forts - appear in the eastern district. A vitrified fort crowns the hill of Knockfarrel in the parish of Fodderty, and there is a circular dun near the village of Lochcarron. Some fine examples of sculptured stones occur, especially those that, according to tradition, mark the burial-place of the three sons of a Danish king who were shipwrecked off the coast of Nigg. The largest and handsomest of these three crosses - the Clach a&#x27; Charridh, or Stone of Lamentation - stands at Shandwick. It is about 10 feet (3 m) high and contains representations of the martyrdom of St Andrew and figures of an elephant and dog. It fell during a storm in 1847 and was broken into three pieces, two of which were joined back together and re-erected; it is now preserved in a glass pavilion. On the top of the cross in Nigg churchyard are two figures with outstretched arms in the act of supplication; the dove descends between them, and below are two dogs. The cross was knocked down by the fall of the belfry in 1725, but has been riveted together. The third stone formerly stood at Hilton of Cadboll, but was removed for security to the grounds of Invergordon Castle.

Among old castles are those of Loch Slin Castle, in the parish of Fearn, said to date from the 13th century; Ballone Castle, in the parish of Tarbat, once a stronghold of the Earls of Ross; the remains of Dingwall Castle, their original seat; and Eilean Donan in Loch Alsh, which was blown up by British warships during the abortive Jacobite rising in 1719.
Ross is first recorded as a territorial unit in a hagiography of the Scottish-born saint Cathróe of Metz, written in Metz shortly after the saint&#x27;s death between 971 and 976. Ross appears to have been separated from Moray during the 10th century, with the boundary between them generally following the River Beauly. The Scottish crown claimed the overlordship of Ross and neighbouring Caithness (which then included Sutherland) from Norway in 1098, but the process of establishing effective Scottish authority over the area took many years. Whereas Moray to the south was divided into shires (areas administered by a sheriff) during the 12th century, Ross and Caithness at that time were placed under the nominal jurisdiction of the Sheriff of Inverness (one of the three sheriffdoms created covering the province of Moray) rather than being given their own sheriffs.

By the mid-13th century there were sheriffs at Cromarty and Dingwall, both within the province of Ross, but each appears to have had only a small area of jurisdiction around those towns, rather than the larger territories usually given to sheriffs. The Sheriff of Inverness was therefore still responsible for most of Ross and Caithness. The position of Sheriff of Dingwall did not endure.
The Diocese of Ross was in existence by the mid-12th century, and by the 13th century it was based at Fortrose Cathedral.

The title of Mormaer or Earl of Ross was created several times from the mid-12th century. William, the 4th Earl of Ross, was present with his clan at the Battle of Bannockburn (1314), and almost a century later (1412) the castle of Dingwall, the chief seat on the mainland of Donald, Lord of the Isles, was captured by Donald just before the battle of Harlaw in Aberdeenshire, which Donald fought because the ambitious Stewarts, governing in the absence of James I, rejected his wife Mariota&#x27;s rightful claim to the earldom. After the battle, the people of Ross embraced Donald and Mariota as rightful rulers of the earldom notwithstanding the Duke of Albany (a Stewart) purporting to give it to his son. Donald died in 1423 and in 1424 the earldom reverted to the crown, but James I soon afterwards restored it to Mariota, wife of Donald Macdonald, and the heiress of the earldom. She was the mother of Alexander Macdonald, Lord of the Isles, who thus became the 11th Earl.

In consequence, however, of the treason of John Macdonald, 4th and last Lord of the Isles and 12th Earl of Ross, the earldom was again vested in the crown (1476). Five years later James III bestowed it on his second son, James Stewart, whom he also created Duke of Ross in 1488.

By the 16th century the whole area of the county was occupied by different clans. The Rosses held what is now Easter Ross; the Munros the small tract around Ben Wyvis, including Dingwall; the Macleods Lewis, and, in the mainland, the district between Loch Maree and Loch Torridon; the Macdonalds of Glengarry, Coigach, and the district between Strome Ferry and Kyle of Lochalsh, and the Mackenzies the remainder.
The shire of Inverness was further enlarged in the 15th century to take in the Outer Hebrides and some of the Inner Hebrides (notably Skye) when the Lordship of the Isles was fully absorbed into the kingdom of Scotland. An act of parliament in 1504 acknowledged that the shire of Inverness was too big for the effective administration of justice, and so declared Ross and Caithness to be separate shires. In the event, that act was not put into effect as far as Ross was concerned. A subsequent act in 1661 finally separated Ross from Inverness-shire. The new shire of Ross also included the northern Outer Hebrides, notably the Isle of Lewis, which was owned by Kenneth Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Seaforth, a major landowner in Ross. The shire of Ross excluded the small area of Cromartyshire, which just covered the area around the town itself at that time.

Apart from occasional conflicts between rival clans, the only battles in the county were at Invercarron, at the head of Dornoch Firth, when Montrose was crushed by Colonel Archibald Strachan on 27 April 1650; and at Glenshiel, where the Jacobites, under the Earl of Seaforth, aided by Spaniards, were defeated by a force under the command of General Joseph Wightman on 10 June 1719.

In the late 17th century, Cromartyshire was significantly enlarged to take over numerous separate tracts of land across Ross-shire. Despite many being some distance from Cromarty itself, they were owned by George Mackenzie, Viscount of Tarbat, who owned the barony of Cromarty and wanted all his lands to be in the same shire. From 1747 onwards Ross-shire and Cromartyshire shared a sheriff, but the two counties remained separate, having their own Lord-lieutenants and Commissioners of Supply, until they were united into the single county of Ross and Cromarty in 1889. With all of Cromartyshire having been part of the medieval province of Ross, the new county of Ross and Cromarty covered broadly the same area as the old province of Ross, but with the addition of the Isle of Lewis.

==Geography==

Ross lies south of Sutherland and the Dornoch Firth, west of the North Sea and the Moray Firth, north of the Beauly Firth and Inverness-shire and east of The Minch. There are also a number of small islands off the area&#x27;s west coast, among which are:

* Gillean (lighthouse) in the parish of Lochalsh
* Crowlin Islands in Applecross
* Eilean Horrisdale, and Isle of Ewe in Gairloch parish
* Isle Martin and Tanera More, of the Summer Isles group in the parish of Lochbroom

The area of the mainland is .

On the North Sea (eastern) side of the county the major firths are the Beauly Firth and the (Inner) Moray Firth, which separate the Black Isle from Inverness-shire; the Cromarty Firth, which bounds the districts of Easter Ross and the Black Isle; the Moray Firth, separating Easter Ross from Nairnshire; and the Dornoch Firth, dividing north-east Ross from Sutherland.

On the Atlantic (western) coastline—which has a length of nearly —the principal sea lochs and bays, from south to north, are Loch Duich, Loch Alsh, Loch Carron, Loch Kishorn, Loch Torridon, Loch Shieldaig, Upper Loch Torridon, Gair Loch, Loch Ewe, Gruinard Bay, Loch Broom and Enard Bay.

The chief capes include Tarbat Ness on the east coast, and Coigach, Greenstone Point, Rubha Reidh, Redpoint and Hamha Point on the west.

Almost all the southern boundary with Inverness-shire consists of a rampart of peaks, many of them Munros:
* An Riabhachan (),
* Sgurr na Lapaich (),
* Carn Eige (Càrn Eighe) (),
* Mam Sodhail (Mam Soul) (),
* Beinn Fhada (Ben Attow) (),
* Sgurr Fhuaran (),
* The Saddle ().

To the north of Glen Torridon are the masses of Liathach (), Beinn Eighe (), Beinn Alligin () and Beinn Dearg (). On the northeastern shore of Loch Maree rises Slioch (), while the Fannich group contains six Munros, the highest being Sgurr Mor (). The immense isolated bulk of Ben Wyvis (), forms the most noteworthy feature in the north-east, and An Teallach () in the north-west appears equally conspicuous, though less solitary. Only a small fraction of the west and south of the area is under in height. Easter Ross and the peninsula of the Black Isle are comparatively level.

The longest stream of the mainland portion of Ross and Cromarty is the River Orrin, which rises from the slopes of An Sidhean () and pursues a north-easterly course to its confluence with the River Conon after a run of about , a small part of which forms the boundary with Inverness-shire. At Aultgowrie the stream rushes through a narrow gorge where the drop is considerable enough to make the Falls of Orrin. The River Blackwater flows from mountains in Strathvaich southeast for until it joins the Conon, forming soon after it leaves Loch Garve the small but picturesque Falls of Rogie. Within a short distance of its exit from Loch Luichart the Conon pours over a series of cascades and rapids and then pursues a winding course of , mainly eastward to the head of the Cromarty Firth. Situated above Glen Elchaig in the southwest of the region are the Falls of Glomach. The stream giving rise to them drains a series of small lochs on the northern flanks of Beinn Fhada (Ben Attow) and, in an almost unbroken sheet over a metre in width, effects a sheer drop of 110 m, and soon afterwards ends its course in Glen Elchaig. The falls are usually visited from Invershiel 11 km to the south-west. 12 miles south-east of Ullapool, on the estate of Braemore, are the Falls of Measach, formed by the Droma, a headstream of the River Broom. The cascades, three in number, are close to Corrieshalloch Gorge. The River Oykel, throughout its course, forms the boundary with Sutherland.

There are many freshwater lochs, the largest being Loch Maree. In the far north-west, above the sea, lies Loch Sionascaig, a loch of such irregularity of outline that it has a shore-line of . It contains several wooded islands, and drains into Enard Bay by the River Polly. Lochan Fada (the long loch), above the sea, is in length, and covers an area of , and is deep, with a mean depth of . Once drained by the Muice (Allt na Muice), it has been tapped a little farther west by the Abhainn na Fhasaigh, which has lowered the level of the loch. Other lochs are Fionn Loch (the white or clear lake), long by wide, famous for its herons, Loch Luichart towards the centre of the area (8 miles long and between wide), fringed with birches and having the shape of a crescent, the mountain-girt Loch Fannich ( wide); and the wild narrow Lochs Monar ( long) and Mullardoch ( long), on the Inverness-shire boundary.

Of the straths or valleys, the more important run from the centre eastwards, such as Strathconon, Strathbran, Strathgarve, Strathpeffer and Strathcarron. Excepting Glen Orrin, in the east central district, the longer glens lie in the south and towards the west. In the extreme south Glen Shiel runs between five mountains (the Five Sisters of Kintail) to its mouth on Loch Duich. The A87 passes down the glen. Further north lie Glen Elchaig, Glen Carron, and Glen Torridon. The railway from Dingwall runs through Glen Carron to Kyle of Lochalsh.

==Geology==

The central portion of this county is occupied by the younger highland schists or Dalradian series. These consist of quartzites, mica-schists, garnetiferous mica-schists and gneisses, all with a gentle inclination towards the southeast. On the eastern side of the county the Dalradian schists are covered unconformably by the Old Red Sandstone. The boundary runs southward from Edderton on Dornoch Firth, by Strathpeffer, to the neighborhood of Beauly. These rocks comprise red flags and sandstones, grey bituminous flags and shales. An anticlinal fold with a southwest–northeast axis brings up the basal beds of the series about the mouth of Cromarty Firth and exposes once more the schists in The Sutors (The Sutors of Cromarty) guarding the entrance to the firth. The western boundary of the younger schist is formed by the great pre-Cambrian dislocation line that traverses the county in a fairly direct course from Elphin on the north by Ullapool to Glencarron. Most of the area west of the line of disturbance is covered by Torridonian Sandstone, mainly dark reddish sandstones, grits and shales, resting unconformably on the ancient Lewisian gneiss with horizontal or slightly inclined bedding. The unconformity is well exposed on the shores of Gairloch, Loch Maree and Loch Torridon. These rocks, which attain a considerable thickness and are divisible into three sub-groups, build up the mountain districts of Applecross, Coigach and elsewhere.

Within the Torridonian tract the older Lewisian gneiss occupies large areas north of Coigach, on the east of Enard Bay, between Gruinard Bay and Loch Maree. Between the last named and Gairloch, on both sides of middle Loch Torridon and at many other spots smaller patches appear. The Lewisian gneiss is everywhere penetrated by basic dikes, generally with a northwest–southeast direction; some of these are of great breadth. The Torridonian rocks are succeeded unconformably by a series of Cambrian strata confined to a variable but narrow belt west of the line of main thrusting. This belt of Cambrian rocks has suffered an enormous amount of subordinate thrusting. It is composed of the following subdivisions in ascending order: falsebedded quartzite, Pipe Rock quartzite, fucoid beds and Olenellus band, serpulite grit, Durness dolomite and marble, Durness dolomite and limestone: but these are not always visible at any one spot. So great has been the disturbance in the region of thrusting that in some places, as in the neighborhood of Loch Kishorn and elsewhere, the rocks have been completely overturned and the ancient gneiss has been piled upon the Torridonian.

On the shore of Moray Firth at Rathie a small patch of Kimeridge shale occurs, and beneath the cliffs of Shandwick there is a little Lower Oolite with a thin seam of coal. Glacial striae are found upon the mountains up to heights of , and much boulder clay is found in the valleys and spread over large areas in the eastern districts. Raised beaches occur at up to or so above the present sea-level; they are well seen in Loch Carron.

==Climate and agriculture==

The west coast has high rainfall: an annual average of at Loch Broom and at Strome Ferry (autumn and winter being the wettest seasons), but on the east coast the annual average is only . The average daily maximum temperature for the year is . Average daily maxima for January and July are and respectively.

The most fertile tracts lie on the eastern coast, especially in Easter Ross and the Black Isle, where the soil varies from a light sandy gravel to a rich deep loam. As of 1911, among grain crops oats were most generally cultivated, but barley and wheat were also raised. Turnips and potatoes were the chief green crops. The higher land contains much good pasturage, with many sheep, blackfaced being the principal breed. Most of the horses, principally half-breds between the old garrons (hardy, serviceable, small animals) and Clydesdales, were maintained for the purposes of agriculture. The herds of cattle, mainly native Highland or crosses, were large, many of them supplying the London market. Pigs were reared, though in smaller numbers than formerly, most generally by the crofters.

As of 1911 about were devoted to deer forests, a greater area than in any other county in Scotland, among the largest being Achnashellach with , Fannich with , Kinlochluichart with , Braemore with , Inchbae with and Dundonnell with . At one time the area under wood must have been remarkable, if we accept the common derivation of the word &quot;Ross&quot; as from the Old Irish &quot;ros&quot;, a wood, and there was until recent times a considerable extent of native woodland, principally pine, oak, ash and alder.

The fauna was noteworthy. Red and roe deer abounded, and foxes and alpine hares were common, while badgers and wild cats were occasionally trapped. Winged game was plentiful, and amongst birds of prey the golden eagle and osprey occurred. Waterfowl of all kinds frequented the sea lochs. Many rivers and lochs were rich in salmon and trout, and the pearl mussel was found in the bed of the Conon.

<text>Loosley Row is a hamlet in the civil parish of Lacey Green, Buckinghamshire, England. It is located in the Chiltern Hills to the east of the main town of Princes Risborough. In the 2011 Census, the population was recorded in the Lacey Green Parish, which included Speen, parts of Walter&#x27;s Ash, and Lacey Green, with a combined population of 2,559.

The hamlet sits on a west-facing chalk escarpment, that stretches to north-eastwards to Coombe Hill.

==History==
The hamlet name derives from the Old English &quot;hlose-leah&quot;, and means &#x27;pigstye-clearing&#x27;. It is often said that the hamlet was named after the Loosley family but it is, in fact, the other way round - the family was named after the place.

The Domesday book talks of the large number of pigs at (Princes) Risborough. Pigs were often found in clearings at the edges of the woods, the animals allowed to wander through sectioned areas of the woods. The row of piggeries in the lea of the woods became the start of a settlement called Loosley Row. Loosley Row stretched from Brimmer&#x27;s Farm, east of Princes Risborough, round the side of the hill to the hamlet we know today. It included Wardrobes farm and Wardrobes House. The old township of Loosley Row, stretched over to Bledlow Ridge, across what is now the A4010 road.

The underlying geology consists of chalk which typifies the area around Princes Risborough. Loosley Row sits as the south end of a chalk escarpment that runs south-westwards from Coombe Hill to Loosley Row and affords good views of the Vale of Aylesbury to the west.

The hamlet used to have a chapel, a school, a village store, a bakery and a post office, but these have all now been closed (the school was shut down in 1916). The hamlet also has a dried up parish well, which is situated on what is claimed to be the smallest patch of common land in the Chilterns. A forge, which lends its name to Foundry Lane through the hamlet, still operates in Loosley Row. It has created some of the bus shelters seen on the road through Lacey Green from Princes Risborough.

==Notable people==
The television astronomer, Heather Couper, lived in the hamlet.

The &#x27; Buckinghamshire Examiner &#x27; newspaper reported (on the 14th. January,1994), that meteoroogist and tv. weather and Bert Foord
was a resident.

Astronomer, science writer and Virgin Galactic astronaut Nigel Henbest has lived in Loosley Row for over 30 years.

<text>Simon George Thomas (born 28 December 1963) is a Welsh former politician who was a member of Plaid Cymru. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Ceredigion from 2000 to 2005, and an Assembly Member in the National Assembly for Wales representing the Mid and West Wales list between 2011 and 2018.

Thomas resigned as an Assembly Member and his party membership on 25 July 2018, following arrest by police on suspicion of possession of indecent images. On 3 October 2018, he pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images of children. On 31 October 2018 he was given a 26-week jail sentence, suspended for two years.

==Early life==
He went to Aberdare Boys&#x27; Grammar School (became Aberdare Boys&#x27; Comprehensive School in 1978). At the University of College Wales, Aberystwyth, he gained a BA in Welsh and Education in 1985. He gained a Postgraduate diploma (DipLib) from the College of Librarianship Wales (CLW) in Llanbadarn Fawr, Aberystwyth in 1988 (College became part of the university in 1989).

He was assistant curator for the National Library of Wales from 1986 to 1992. From 1992 to 1994, he was a political advisor for the Plaid-run Taff-Ely borough council. From 1994 to 2000, he was Rural Development Manager for the JIGSO rural development agency.

Thomas is the father of two children. At the time of his trial, he lived in Penparcau, a village south of Aberystwyth. Locals have raised concern that he lives on the same street as a primary school.

==Political career==
Thomas was elected as a Councillor in Ceredigion County Council for Aberystwyth East in 1999 and resigned after being elected a Member of Parliament. He was fifth on Plaid Cymru&#x27;s regional list for Mid and West Wales in the inaugural National Assembly for Wales election in 1999; only list leader Cynog Dafis was elected.

Thomas was first elected as MP for Ceredigion in the 2000 by-election after Dafis stepped down to focus on his role as an Assembly member. On entering the House of Commons, he took the oath of allegiance in the Welsh language, and was heckled by some English MPs. He retained the seat for Plaid Cymru at the 2001 election with a reduced majority, and lost it in the 2005 general election to Mark Williams of the Liberal Democrats. During the 2005 general election he wrote a blog on the Channel 4 News website which shows a near daily account of his campaign trail and his thoughts following his defeat. Thomas said he had not expected his defeat. According to a BBC news report he said &quot;I was getting a very positive response on the doorstep&quot;. In the aftermath of his defeat, he called for Plaid Cymru to reform its leadership arrangements and have a single leader &quot;round which the party coalesces and around which the people of Wales can identify&quot;.

Ahead of the 2007 election he sought a place on Plaid Cymru&#x27;s South Wales Central list. After being placed 4th by his party and facing no realistic chance of being elected he withdrew and did not stand. Following the 2007 Welsh Assembly election, he was appointed a special adviser to the Plaid Cymru ministers in the Welsh Assembly Government coalition between his party and Labour.

In September 2010, Simon Thomas was placed at the top of Plaid Cymru&#x27;s regional list for Mid and West Wales in the 2011 Welsh Assembly election with the incumbent Nerys Evans instead running for the constituency seat of Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire. He was elected to the National Assembly for Wales.

When a party leadership election was triggered by the resignation of Ieuan Wyn Jones, Thomas announced his candidacy on 1 December 2011. The following 6 February, he withdrew in favour of Elin Jones, running to become her deputy leader. The election was won by Leanne Wood.

Ahead of the 2016 Assembly Election, unsuccessfully sought the Plaid Cymru nomination for Llanelli, but lost out to Helen Mary Jones, he went on to stand in the constituency of Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, coming third as Angela Burns retained it for the Conservatives, he was however returned on the Mid and West Wales List.

Following the 2016 election he was elected unopposed as chair of the Assembly&#x27;s Finance Committee, a position he held until July 2018.

==United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal==

As part of the investigation into United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal, Thomas was found to have over claimed £349.20 in mortgage interest between 2004 and 2005 under the additional costs allowance (ACA). He was recommended to repay this sum, by 1 April 2009 no money was repaid.

==Arrest and resignation==

On 25 July 2018 he resigned as an AM and from Plaid Cymru following his arrest by police on suspicion of possession of indecent images. His seat was taken by Helen Mary Jones, who was next in line on Plaid&#x27;s regional list.

On 18 September he was charged by Dyfed-Powys Police with three counts of making indecent images of children. In the context of digital media, saving an indecent image to a computer&#x27;s hard drive is considered to be &quot;making&quot; the image, as it causes a copy to exist which did not exist before.

He pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images at Aberystwyth Magistrates&#x27; Court on 3 October 2018, having made over 600 such images and videos. On 31 October 2018 he was given a 26-week jail sentence, suspended for two years by Mold Magistrates Courts and ordered to remain on the sex offenders register for seven years.

==Electoral performance==
Thomas contested several elections under the Plaid Cymru banner:

National Assembly Regional Seats
National Assembly Constituency Seats
Westminster Parliament elections

<text>Loudwater is a village in the parish of Chepping Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located in the valley to the east of High Wycombe, on the A40 London Road.

== History ==
The village name refers to the River Wye nearby, that also flows through High Wycombe. In manorial records in 1241 the village was referred to as &quot;La Ludewatere&quot;.

The brick built St Peter&#x27;s Church dates from 1788 with a gothic style chancel added in 1903 and further improvements in recent years, including new windows. On the London Road there is a Victorian mansion called Burleighfield House that was once the studio of the stained glass designer Patrick Reyntiens.

There was once a blotting paper mill in the valley and Loudwater had its own railway station on the Wycombe Railway that opened in 1854 and closed in 1970.

Today there is little to distinguish the village from the urban sprawl of High Wycombe, though it is signed along the London Road. A 1744 milestone can still be seen and there is also still a traditional village pub &#x27;The Derehams Inn&#x27; in Derehams Lane.

The Derehams Inn closed in 2021. However, there is an active Community Group trying to save it from residential development.

== Features==
Loudwater is home to several retail and industrial concerns - a large Tesco supermarket, an industrial estate, a small retail park, a Brewers Fayre motel and also the office of the local newspaper, the Bucks Free Press. The M40 motorway crosses over the valley close to the village, and facilitates the eastbound only Junction 3, signposted as &#x27;Wycombe East&#x27;.

Loudwater was once served by the High Wycombe to Bourne End railway line, the station being situated at the bottom of Treadaway Hill. The line and station closed in 1970, the old railway path can still be walked through Fennel Wood.

Loudwater is known as the Headquarters of Dreams Beds, Costa Coffee and Fonehouse.

Loudwater has a primary school called Loudwater Combined School, located on Kingsmead Road.

==Modern Loughton district==
The original village has now been incorporated into the modern &#x27;grid square&#x27; of Loughton. However much of the character of the old village remains; to the north-east of Bradwell Road the area bounded by School Lane and Church Lane contains the Church and remnants of the original parish of Great Loughton. To the south-west of Bradwell Road, around The Green there is a cluster of several sixteenth century buildings (Manor Farm, Manor Farm Cottages and Cell Farm) which constitute the remains of the original parish of Little Loughton.

Today Loughton is a mainly residential area but is also home to a large Equestrian Centre, in the grounds of which the medieval field pattern and fish pond can still be seen.

The district is bounded by the A5 to the east, H5 Portway to the north, V4 Watling Street to the west and H6 Childs Way to the south.

==Pronunciation==
The Received Pronunciation of Loughton is (the &quot;ou&quot; rhymes with &quot;ouch&quot;, the &quot;gh&quot; is silent), in contrast to the similarly-spelt neighbouring areas of Broughton and Woughton .

<doc id="417641" wikidata="Q1900117" url="?curid=417641" title="Mark Hopkins Jr.">
<text>Mark Hopkins Jr. (September 3, 1814 – March 29, 1878) was an American railroad executive. He was one of four principal investors that funded Theodore D. Judah&#x27;s idea of building a railway over the Sierra Nevada from Sacramento, California, to Promontory, Utah. They formed the Central Pacific Railroad along with Leland Stanford, Charles Crocker, and Collis Huntington in 1861.

==Early years and family life==
Hopkins was born in Henderson, Jefferson County, New York to Mark Hopkins and Anastasia Lukens Kellogg, who were first cousins. Because his father died when he was a boy, he was never known as &quot;Junior&quot;. The family moved to St. Clair, Michigan in 1824. His father, Mark Hopkins (1779–1828), served as Postmaster, first in Henderson, NY, then in St. Clair, Michigan (known then as Palmer, Michigan), where he was also Judge of Probate.

The elder Hopkins died in 1828, and his son left school to work as a clerk. In 1837, he studied law with his brother Henry but moved on through several business ventures. He was a partner in a firm called &quot;Hopkins and Hughes&quot;, then a bookkeeper and later manager for &quot;James Rowland and Company&quot;.

On September 22, 1854, in New York City, Hopkins married his first cousin, Mary Frances Sherwood. Though his background was Congregationalist, the wedding was at a Presbyterian Church. Mary and Mark Hopkins had no children of their own. Mary adopted Timothy Nolan, the adult son of her housekeeper, who took the Hopkins name and was given an administrative position at the Union Pacific Railroad. Despite Hopkins&#x27; thriftiness, his wife managed eventually to persuade him to build an ornate mansion at the top of Nob Hill in San Francisco, California, close to the mansions of other Central Pacific founders. The construction commenced in 1875. The architects were the prominent San Francisco firm of Wright &amp; Sanders and the project manager was architectural engineer William Wallace Barbour Sheldon, who worked for Hopkins under the Southern Pacific Improvement Company.

==California==

When the California Gold Rush began, Hopkins created the &quot;New England Mining and Trading Company&quot;, a group of 26 men each of whom invested $500 to purchase goods and ship them to California for sale. On January 22, 1849 Hopkins left New York City on the ship &quot;Pacific&quot;. After rounding Cape Horn, the ship arrived in San Francisco on August 5, 1849.

Hopkins opened a store in Placerville, California, but it did not succeed and he relocated to Sacramento where he opened a wholesale grocery in 1850 with his friend Edward H. Miller. Miller would later be secretary of the Central Pacific Railroad.

In 1855, Hopkins and Collis P. Huntington formed &quot;Huntington Hopkins and Company&quot; to operate a hardware and iron business in Sacramento.

In 1861, as part of The Big Four, he founded the Central Pacific Railroad. Sometimes called &quot;Uncle Mark&quot;, he was the eldest of the four partners and was well known for his thriftiness (it was said that he knew how to &quot;squeeze 106 cents out of every dollar&quot;, a reputation that gained him the post of company treasurer. Noted American historian Hubert Howe Bancroft quotes Collis Huntington as saying, &quot;I never thought anything finished until Hopkins looked at it&quot;. Bancroft described Hopkins as the &quot;balance-wheel of the Associates and one of the truest and best men that ever lived.&quot;

==Later years and death==
A Whig and later associated with the Free Soil Party, Hopkins was an abolitionist and an organizer of the Republican Party in California.

By then, Hopkins was having health problems and in 1878 died aboard a company train near Yuma, Arizona. At the time of his death, the house was not complete and was eventually finished and occupied by Mary. The structure later burned to the ground in a fire caused by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. In 1926, the Mark Hopkins Hotel (currently InterContinental Mark Hopkins San Francisco) was built on the site.

Hopkins is buried in Sacramento Historic City Cemetery (aka Old City Cemetery) in Sacramento, California.

==Estate controversy==

Hopkins died without leaving a will, though his fortune estimated at $20–$40 million was inherited by his wife. Faced with the task of completing their new estate alone, Mary retained Herter Brothers, a prominent furniture and interior decorating firm in New York to finish furnishing and decorating the estate. Edward Francis Searles was dispatched by Herter Brothers to manage the completion of Mary&#x27;s project. 

Despite being 22 years younger her junior and Mary developed a close relationship. The unseemly courtship raised eyebrows and questions about the motives of the decorator in the wealthy social circles of San Francisco, but they married in 1887 to begin a six-month grand tour of Europe. Shortly after their return, Mary executed a new will that explicitly excluded her adopted son Timothy Nolan Hopkins, explaining; &quot;The omission to provide in this will for my adopted son, Timothy Hopkins, is intentional, and not occasioned by accident or mistake&quot;, and left her fortunes to her new husband, Edward.

Mr. and Mrs. Searles moved to Edward&#x27;s hometown of Methuen, Massachusetts, where Edward embarked on building a series of grand homes designed by English architect Henry Vaughan. Vaughan was best known for his Gothic Revival ecclesiastical architecture including; the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., three chapels at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York, and Christ Church, New Haven, Connecticut.

Mary died in 1891, less than four years after her marriage and the estate went into probate to reconcile a series of legal challenges by Timothy Hopkins (Mary&#x27;s adopted son) that lasted for several years, to reclaim his lost inheritance. The controversy made good fodder for the press, California papers published stories suggesting that Edward had exploited Mary&#x27;s interest in spiritualism and falsified records to wrest the estate from her adopted son and defraud business partners. Under oath, Edward testified that he had married Mary &quot;…partly out of affection and partly for her money.&quot; Timothy lost his appeals; however, Edward later settled on Timothy a &quot;token&quot; amount of several million dollars. Timothy got the contents of the mansion in San Francisco, and the art institute got the building. (It was rumored at the time that Edward Searles had a friend/lover living with him after Mary&#x27;s death and that Timothy Hopkins used this information to blackmail Edward after losing the court case.)

General Thomas Hubbard had been named the executor of Mary Frances Searles&#x27; will, and had been embroiled in the controversy as a witness with detailed knowledge of the Hopkins and Searles estates. When the probate case closed in Edward&#x27;s favor, Hubbard declined any personal compensation but suggested an endowment to his alma mater Bowdoin College might make an enduring symbol of Edward&#x27;s love for Mary. Edward agreed to build them the modern science building, still in service as Searles Hall.

For the remainder of his life, Edward, increasingly reclusive, continued building castles and estates designed by Henry Vaughan, including Searles Castle in Windham, New Hampshire, (a ¼ replica of Stanton Harcourt Manor in Oxon, England) and Pine Lodge in his hometown of Methuen, Massachusetts. 

Eventually, Edward Searles&#x27; business manager, Arthur T Walker, inherited the Hopkins estate. He died several years later living modestly, as though he had never inherited a thing.

<text>USS &quot;Barb&quot; (SS-220), a , was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the Barbus, a genus of ray-finned fish. She compiled one of the most outstanding records of any U.S. submarine in World War II. During her twelve war patrols, &quot;Barb&quot; is officially credited with sinking 17 enemy vessels totaling 96,628 tons, including the Japanese aircraft carrier . In recognition of one outstanding patrol, &quot;Barb&quot; received the Presidential Unit Citation. On her twelfth and final patrol of the war, she landed a party of carefully selected crew members who blew up a train, the only ground combat operation in the Japanese (four main) home islands.

== United States Navy service history ==

=== World War II ===
The keel of USS &quot;Barb&quot; was laid down on 7 June 1941 by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 2 April 1942 (sponsored by Mrs. Charles A. Dunn, wife of Rear Admiral Dunn), and commissioned on 8 July 1942.

&quot;Barb&quot;″s war operations spanned the period from 20 October 1942 – 2 August 1945, during which time she completed 12 war patrols.

==== European Theater – First through fifth patrols ====
During her first patrol she carried out reconnaissance duties prior to, and during, the invasion of North Africa. Operating out of Rosneath naval base, Scotland until July 1943, she conducted her next four patrols against the Axis blockade runners in European waters. &quot;Barb&quot;″s fifth patrol terminated 1 July and she proceeded to the Submarine Base, New London, Connecticut, arriving on 24 July.

==== Pacific Theater – Sixth through twelfth patrols ====
Following a brief overhaul period at New London, &quot;Barb&quot; departed for Pearl Harbor where she arrived in September. It was in the Pacific waters that &quot;Barb&quot; found lucrative hunting and went on to compile one of the more outstanding submarine records of World War II. During the seven war patrols she conducted in the Pacific between March 1944 and August 1945, &quot;Barb&quot; is officially credited with sinking 17 enemy vessels totaling 96,628 tons, including , sunk on 17 September 1944. On 15–16 September &quot;Barb&quot; rescued 14 Australian and British POW survivors of .
The last five war patrols (8-12) conducted by &quot;Barb&quot; were under Commander Eugene B. Fluckey. Her 11th patrol lasted from 19 December 1944 – 15 February 1945, in the Formosa Straits and East China Sea off the east coast of China, from Shanghai to Kam Kit. During this patrol, &quot;Barb&quot; sank four Japanese merchant ships and numerous enemy small craft. On 22–23 January &quot;Barb&quot; penetrated Namkwan Harbor now called Yanpu Wan (沿浦湾) on the China coast, opposite the Matsu Islands, and wrought havoc upon a convoy of some 30 enemy ships at anchor. Maneuvering in dangerously shallow waters, &quot;Barb&quot; launched her torpedoes into the enemy group and then retired at high speed on the surface in a full hour&#x27;s run through uncharted, heavily mined, and rock-obstructed waters. In recognition of this outstanding patrol, Commander Fluckey was awarded the Medal of Honor and &quot;Barb&quot; received the Presidential Unit Citation.

Upon completion of her 11th patrol, &quot;Barb&quot; was sent to the U.S. for a yard overhaul and alterations, which included the installation of rocket launchers at the Captain&#x27;s request. Returning to the Pacific, she commenced her 12th and final patrol of World War II on 8 June. This patrol was conducted along the coasts of the Sea of Okhotsk. For the first time in U.S. submarine warfare, &quot;Barb&quot; successfully employed rockets, against the towns of Shari, Hokkaido; Shikuka; Kashiho; and Shiritoru on Karafuto. On 2 July; she also bombarded the garrison on Tyuleny (Kaihyo) Island with her regular armament, destroying the constructions and causing a fire. She next landed a party of carefully selected crew members who blew up a railroad train.

During the night of 22–23 July 1945 these men went ashore at Karafuto, Japan, and planted an explosive charge that subsequently wrecked a train. They were: Chief Gunners Mate Paul G. Saunders, USN; Electricians Mate 3rd Class Billy R. Hatfield, USNR; Signalman 2nd Class Francis Neal Sever, USNR; Ships Cook 1st Class Lawrence W. Newland, USN; Torpedoman&#x27;s mate 3rd Class Edward W. Klingesmith, USNR; Motor Machinists Mate 2nd Class James E. Richard, USN; Motor Machinists Mate 1st Class John Markuson, USN; and Lieutenant William M. Walker, USNR. This raid is represented by the train symbol in the middle bottom of the battle flag.

=== Post-war history ===
Returning to the United States after the cessation of hostilities, &quot;Barb&quot; was placed in commissioned reserve on 9 March 1946 and decommissioned reserve on 12 February 1947 at New London, Connecticut. On 3 December 1951, she was recommissioned and assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, operating out of Key West, Florida. She was again decommissioned on 5 February 1954 and underwent the Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program (GUPPY) conversion. Recommissioned on 3 August 1954, she served with the Atlantic Fleet until 13 December 1954, when she was decommissioned a final time and loaned to Italy under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program.

== &quot;Enrico Tazzoli&quot; (S 511) ==
The submarine was renamed &quot;Enrico Tazzoli&quot; (S 511) by the Italian Navy, after Enrico Tazzoli, an Italian priest.

The submarine was eventually sold for scrap in 1972 for approximately $100,000 (currently $). Admiral Fluckey noted that, had the crew known of this, they would have bought the sub and brought her back to the U.S. to serve as a museum ship.

== Awards ==
* Presidential Unit Citation
* Navy Unit Commendation
* European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with one battle star
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with seven battle stars
* World War II Victory Medal
* National Defense Service Medal

== Legacy ==
&quot;Barb&quot;″s battle flag is on display at the Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton, Connecticut.

Another submarine was named for USS &quot;Barb&quot; and served in the U.S. Navy from 1963 to 1989.

On 13 October 2020, Secretary of the Navy Kenneth Braithwaite announced that a future &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarine (SSN-804) will be named for USS &quot;Barb&quot;.

<text>Ophioglossaceae, the adder&#x27;s-tongue family, is a small family of ferns. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), it is the only family in the order Ophioglossales, which together with the Psilotales is placed in the subclass Ophioglossidae. The Ophioglossidae are one of the groups traditionally known as eusporangiate ferns. Members of the family differ from other ferns in a number of ways. Many have only a single fleshy leaf at a time. Their gametophytes are subterranean and rely on fungi for energy.

==Description==

Members of Ophioglossaceae are usually terrestrial (excepting a few epiphytic species of &quot;Ophioglossum&quot;) and occur in both temperate and tropical areas. They differ from the other ferns in several respects: 
* Many species only send up one frond or leaf-blade per year, producing only a single leaf at a time. The leaves are usually fleshy, and in temperate areas will often turn brownish or reddish during colder months.
* Instead of the leptosporangia typical of most ferns they produce eusporangia, which are larger, contain more spores, and have thicker walls.
* Their sporophylls (spore-bearing leaves) are divided into two distinct parts, the sporophore, which produces sporangia and has a greatly reduced and modified blade, and the rest of the leaf, the trophophore. 
* Their gametophytes are subterranean and rely on fungi for their energy (in other words, they are myco-heterotrophic), unlike the terrestrial, photosynthetic gametophytes found in most ferns.

In addition to having mycoheterotrophic gametophytes, there are a few members of &quot;Botrychium&quot; that are unique among ferns in having the sporophytes also mycoheterotrophic, producing only small, ephemeral sporophylls that do not photosynthesize.

&quot;Botrychium&quot; and &quot;Helminthostachys&quot; are also the only known ferns with secondary growth, even if it is very limited.

The plants have short-lived spores formed in sporangia lacking an annulus, and borne on a stalk that splits from the leaf blade; and fleshy roots. A few species send up fertile spikes only, without any conventional leaf-blade. The spores will not germinate if exposed to sunlight, and the gametophyte can live some two decades without forming a sporophyte.

The genus &quot;Ophioglossum&quot; has the highest chromosome counts of any known plant. The record holder is &quot;Ophioglossum reticulatum&quot;, with about 630 pairs of chromosomes (1260 chromosomes per cell). Other measurements have indicated a chromosome number up to 1440 (n = 720). For comparison, humans have 46 chromosomes, consisting of n = 23 pairs.

&quot;Ophioglossum malviae&quot; from the Western Ghats in India has been characterized as the world&#x27;s smallest terrestrial pteridophyte with plants typically 1–1.2 cm in size.

==Taxonomy==
===History of classification===
The ferns in this group were originally treated as a family and later as the separate order Ophioglossales. In some classifications, they were placed in a separate division, Ophioglossophyta, but molecular phylogenetic studies have shown the Ophioglossales to be closely related to the Psilotales, and both are placed in the class Ophioglossidae.

In the molecular phylogenetic classification of Smith et al. in 2006, Ophioglossales, in its present circumscription, was placed in the class Psilotopsida, along with the order Psilotales. The linear sequence of Christenhusz et al. (2011), intended for compatibility with the classification of Chase and Reveal (2009), which placed all land plants in Equisetopsida, made it a member of subclass Ophioglossidae, equivalent to Smith&#x27;s Psilotopsida. This approach has subsequently been followed in the classifications of Christenhusz and Chase (2014) and PPG I (2016).

Older treatments recognized segregate families within the Ophioglossales, such as Botrychiaceae for the moonworts and grape ferns and Helminthostachyaceae for &quot;Helminthostachys&quot;, but modern treatments combine all members of the order into the single family Ophioglossaceae.

===Subfamilies and genera===


The number of genera into which the family is divided has varied. The Smith system of 2006 used four genera, treating &quot;Botrychium&quot; and &quot;Ophioglossum&quot; broadly. &quot;Cheiroglossa&quot; has been segregated from &quot;Ophioglossum&quot;, or included within it. The PPG I system of 2016 divides the family into four subfamilies:
* Mankyuoideae 
** &quot;Mankyua&quot; 
*Ophioglossoideae (equivalent to &quot;Ophioglossum&quot; s.l. in other systems)
** &quot;Cheiroglossa&quot; 
** &quot;Goswamia&quot; 
** &quot;Haukia&quot; 
** &quot;Ophioderma&quot; 
** &quot;Ophioglossum&quot; 
** &quot;Whittieria&quot; 
* Helminthostachyoideae 
** &quot;Helminthostachys&quot; 
* Botrychioideae (equivalent to &quot;Botrychium&quot; s.l. in other systems)
** &quot;Botrychium&quot; 
** &quot;Botrypus&quot; 
** &quot;Japanobotrychum&quot; 
** &quot;Sahashia&quot; 
** &quot;Sceptridium&quot;

<text>Operation Sutton was the code name for the British landings on the shores of San Carlos Water, at Ajax Bay and Port San Carlos, near San Carlos on East Falkland.

== Landings ==
During the night, 3 Commando Brigade along with attached units of the Parachute Regiment were landed from the liner and the LPD . There was very limited enemy resistance on the ground.

The Argentine Army force on site was a section from the 25th Infantry Regiment named Combat Team Güemes (Spanish: &quot;Equipo de Combate Güemes&quot;), or EC &quot;Güemes&quot;, located at Fanning Head. After the British fleet was spotted at 02:50, EC &quot;Güemes&quot; opened fire with 81mm mortars and two 105mm recoilless rifles. The British warships replied with naval gunfire, and a 25-man SBS team also returned fire. During the firefight, two British helicopters, a Sea King and a Gazelle, passed overhead, and the Argentine troops fired at them with machine guns. The Gazelle&#x27;s pilot, Sergeant Andrew Evans - RM, was hit and fatally injured, but he managed to crash-land the aircraft into the sea. Evans and the other crewman, Sergeant Edward Candlish, were thrown out of the aircraft. Argentine troops shot at them for about 15 minutes as they struggled in the water, ignoring orders from their commanding officer to ceasefire. When the firing ceased, Candlish managed to drag Evans to shore, where he died. Minutes later, a second British Gazelle helicopter, following the same route as the first, was hit by small arms fire from the Argentine platoon and shot down, killing the crew, Lt. Ken Francis and L/Cpl. Pat Giffin.

The Argentinians eventually retreated from Fanning Head, abandoning their communications equipment. At least eight members of another Argentinian platoon who fled the scene were left behind and captured by the British.

Argentine commandos of the 601 Commando Company shot down a GR.3 Harrier on a reconnaissance mission on Port Howard with a Blowpipe missile. The pilot, Flight Lieutenant Glover, bailed out, breaking his arm and collar bone in the process. He was taken prisoner by Argentine soldiers shortly afterward, and flown to a military hospital in Comodoro Rivadavia, Argentina. Six Argentine pilots were killed during the operation.

The invasion, part of the overall Operation Corporate, sparked a strong reply from the Argentine Air Force and Argentine Naval Aviation and led to the Battle of San Carlos.

<doc id="417651" wikidata="Q2895725" url="?curid=417651" title="Pullman, Chicago">
<text>Pullman, one of Chicago&#x27;s 77 defined community areas, is a neighborhood located on the city&#x27;s South Side. Twelve miles from the Chicago Loop, Pullman is situated adjacent to Lake Calumet.

The area known as Pullman encompasses a much wider area than its two historic areas (the older historic area is often referred to as &quot;Pullman&quot; and is a Chicago Landmark district and a national historical park. The northern annex historic area is usually referred to as &quot;North Pullman&quot;). The development built by the Pullman Company is bounded by 103rd Street on the North, 115th Street on the South, the railroad tracks on the East and Cottage Grove on the West.

Since the late 20th century, the Pullman neighborhood has been gentrifying. Many residents are involved in the restoration of their own homes, and projects throughout the district as a whole. Walking tours of Pullman are available.

Pullman has many historic and architecturally significant buildings; among these are the Hotel Florence; the Arcade Building, which was destroyed in the 1920s; the Clock Tower and Factory, the complex surrounding Market Square, and Greenstone Church. In the adjacent Kensington neighborhood of the nearby Roseland district is the home of one of the many beautiful churches in Chicago built in Polish Cathedral style, the former church of St. Salomea. It is now used by Salem Baptist Church of Chicago.

In a contest sponsored by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, Pullman was one of seven sites nominated for the Illinois Seven Wonders.

==History==

===Beginnings===
Historic Pullman was built in the 1880s by George Pullman as workers&#x27; housing for employees of his eponymous railroad car company, the Pullman Palace Car Company. He established behavioral standards that workers had to meet to live in the area and charged them rent. Pullman&#x27;s architect, Solon Spencer Beman, was said to be extremely proud that he had met all the workers&#x27; needs within the neighborhood he designed. The distinctive rowhouses were comfortable by standards of the day, and contained such amenities as indoor plumbing, gas, and sewers.

===Pullman Strike===

During the depression that followed the Panic of 1893, demand for Pullman cars slackened. The Pullman company laid off hundreds of workers and switched many more to pay-per-piece work. This work, while paying more per hour, reduced total worker income. Despite these cutbacks, the Company did not reduce rents for workers who lived in the town of Pullman.

Workers initiated the Pullman Strike in 1894, and it lasted for 2 months, eventually leading to intervention by the US government and military. The Strike Commission, set up in 1894, ruled that the aesthetic features admired by visitors had little monetary value for employees.

===Incorporation into Chicago===
After George Pullman died in 1897, the Illinois Supreme Court required the company to sell the town because operating it was outside the company&#x27;s charter. In 1899, the town and other major portions of the South Side were annexed by the city of Chicago. Within ten years, the city sold the houses to their occupants. After the strike, Pullman gradually was absorbed as a regular Chicago neighborhood, defined by distinguishing Victorian architecture. But the fortunes of the neighborhood continued to rise and fall with the Pullman Company for many years.

===Deindustrialization===
With industrial and railroad restructuring beginning in the 1950s, many jobs were lost in the city. The neighborhood gradually declined along with work opportunities and income. People began to move to newer housing in the suburbs. In 1960 the original Town of Pullman, approximately between 103rd and 115th Streets, was threatened with total demolition for an industrial park. Forming the Pullman Civic Organization, the residents lobbied the city and saved their community. It reached its peak of population in 1970.

===Revival===
By 1972 the Pullman Historic District had obtained National, State, and City landmark status to protect the original 900 rowhouses and public buildings built by George Pullman. (It was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1969 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1970 it was designated as a State landmark by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency; and in 1972, South Pullman was declared a City of Chicago Landmark). To protect the character of the historic districts, the city has established guidelines for new building and renovation, administered by the City of Chicago. These are explained in the &quot;Beman Committee&#x27;s Homeowner&#x27;s Guide&quot; (the committee is named after Pullman&#x27;s original architect, Solon Spencer Beman).

The district was designated the Pullman National Monument under President Obama in February 2015 and re-designated a national historical park in December 2022.

==Demographics==

The Pullman community area is a predominantly African American, older community area, though this is not consistent among each of its neighborhoods.

<text>Post-coital tristesse (; PCT), also known as post-coital dysphoria (PCD), is the feeling of sadness, anxiety, agitation or aggression, after orgasm in sexual intercourse or masturbation. Its name comes from Neo-Latin &quot;postcoitalis&quot; and French &quot;tristesse&quot;, literally &quot;sadness&quot;. Many people with PCT may exhibit strong feelings of anxiety lasting from five minutes to two hours after coitus.

The phenomenon is attributed to the Greek medical writer Galen, who is supposed to have written that &quot;Every animal is sad after coitus except the human female and the rooster.&quot; However, this quotation is not found in Galen&#x27;s surviving writings, so it may be a later fabrication. Sigmund Freud and Havelock Ellis were familiar with the proverb, which they both attributed to an anonymous author, and it was not until decades later that the maxim became connected with Galen among sexologists.

The philosopher Baruch Spinoza, in his &quot;Tractatus de Intellectus Emendatione&quot;, wrote: &quot;For as far as sensual pleasure is concerned, the mind is so caught up in it, as if at peace in a [true] good, that it is quite prevented from thinking of anything else. But after the enjoyment of sensual pleasure is passed, the greatest sadness follows. If this does not completely engross, still it thoroughly confuses and dulls the mind.&quot; Arthur Schopenhauer, writing later on the phenomenon, observed that &quot;directly after copulation the devil&#x27;s laughter is heard.&quot;

One study reported that among a sample of 1208 male participants, 40% of them had experienced PCT at least once in their lifetime and 20% reported experiencing PCT in the four weeks preceding the study. This study also reports that 3–4% of the sample experienced PCT symptoms on a regular basis. According to the same study, PCT among males is associated with current psychological distress, sexual abuse during childhood, and with several sexual dysfunctions.

With respect to symptoms in women, one study involved an epidemiological survey of post-coital psychological symptoms in a United Kingdom population sample of female twins: it found that 3.7% of these women reported suffering from recent PCT and 7.7% of them reported suffering PCT for a long time. Another study reported that almost half of female university students reported PCT symptoms at least once in their lifetime. The study also reported that there appeared to be no correlation between PCT and intimacy in close relationships.

<text>Ludgershall is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority area of Buckinghamshire, England. It is near the boundary with Oxfordshire, about south-east of Bicester and west of Waddesdon.

==Toponym==
The toponym is said to be derived from the Old English for &quot;nook with a trapping spear&quot; but this is disputed. It occurs in more than one place in England (see Ludgershall (disambiguation)). The Domesday Book of 1086 records the village as &quot;Litlegarsele&quot;. The place spelt at &quot;Lotegarshale&quot;, seen in 1381, may refer to the Buckinghamshire village, or the one in Wiltshire.

==History==
Henry II granted land in the parish to the priory of Santingfeld in Picardy, France. It is possible that a hospital was founded on this land, although it is uncertain. In the reign of Henry VI, when all alien church possessions were seized by the Crown, this land was given to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

The theologian John Wyclif was vicar of Ludgershall 1368–74.

==St Mary the Virgin Church==
The parish church of St Mary the Virgin on Church Lane is a Grade I listed church, dating from the 14th century with 19th century additions. The Bible scholar John Wycliffe is reported to have been an early vicar.

==Ludgershall Bike Night==
The village plays host to an annual charity motorbike night, typically on the first Monday in July. The free to attend meet sees riders of vintage, classic and contemporary motorcycles gather on the village green. The event is attended by multiple motorcycle clubs and enthusiasts alike.

<text>USS &quot;Growler&quot; (SS-215), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the third ship of the United States Navy named for the growler.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Growler&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 2 November 1941, sponsored by Mrs. Lucile E. Ghormley, wife of Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, Special Naval Observer to the United Kingdom. &quot;Growler&quot; was commissioned on 20 March 1942 with Lieutenant Commander Howard W. Gilmore in command.

== First patrol (June – July 1942) ==
&quot;Growler&quot;’s first war patrol began 29 June 1942 as she cleared Pearl Harbor for her assigned patrol area around Dutch Harbor, Alaska; stopping off at Midway Island on 24 June she entered her area on 30 June. Five days later she saw her first action; sighting three destroyers, &quot;Growler&quot; closed them submerged, launched her torpedoes and then surfaced. Her torpedoes struck the first two targets amidships putting them out of action, and hit the third in the bow but not before that target had launched two torpedoes at &quot;Growler&quot;. As the Japanese torpedoes &quot;swished down each side&quot;, &quot;Growler&quot; dived deep, but no depth charges followed. The Japanese destroyer was sunk, and the other two, and , were severely damaged. &quot;Growler&quot; completed her patrol without finding any more targets, and on 17 July berthed at Pearl Harbor.

== Second patrol (August – September 1942) ==
On 5 August 1942 &quot;Growler&quot; began her second and most successful war patrol, entering her area near Taiwan on 21 August. Two days later she conducted a submerged night attack on a freighter, surfacing to give chase when both torpedoes ran under the target and failed to explode; the freighter&#x27;s quick exit into shallow waters prevented &quot;Growler&quot;&#x27;s gun attack. Patrolling amidst a large fishing fleet on 25 August, &quot;Growler&quot; sighted and fired at a large passenger freighter but all three torpedoes missed; after a three-hour depth charge attack, in which some 53 &quot;ash cans&quot; were dropped, &quot;Growler&quot; surfaced and almost immediately spotted a convoy. After two hours of maneuvering, she failed to catch up with the main body of the convoy but did fire at and sink an ex-gunboat, &quot;Senyo Maru&quot;. No more ships appeared in this immediate area for three days, so &quot;Growler&quot; shifted to the east side of the island. First to fall victim was &quot;Eifuku Maru&quot;, a 5,866 ton cargo ship, which &quot;Growler&quot; sank within 40 minutes of first sighting her 31 August. On 4 September &quot;Growler&quot; sank &quot;Kashino&quot;, a 10,360 ton supply ship; three days later she sent two torpedoes into the 2,204 ton cargo ship &quot;Taika Maru&quot;, which broke in half and sank in two minutes. On 15 September &quot;Growler&quot; cleared her patrol area, and arrived back at Pearl 30 September.

== Third patrol (October – December 1942) ==
During refitting, new surface radar was installed, as well as a new 20 mm gun; thus equipped, &quot;Growler&quot; sailed from Hawaii for her new patrol area in the Solomon Islands across the key Truk-Rabaul shipping lanes. Her patrol area in these days of bitter fighting over Guadalcanal was almost continually covered by enemy planes and only eight enemy ships were sighted with no chance for attack. &quot;Growler&quot; cleared the area 3 December and arrived in Brisbane, Australia, on 10 December.

== Fourth patrol (January – February 1943) ==
1 January 1943 saw &quot;Growler&quot; sail from Brisbane. Entering her patrol area, again athwart the Truk-Rabaul shipping lanes, on 11 January, she waited only five days before sighting an enemy convoy. Maneuvering inside the escorts, &quot;Growler&quot; launched two torpedoes and saw them hit; then, as her war diary reports, she was in the unfortunate predicament of being about from the destroyer and had to dive without being able to continue the attack. She was credited with sinking &quot;Chifuku Maru&quot;, a 5,857 ton passenger/cargo ship.

The patrol continued as normal with two further attacks, but no sinkings until shortly after 01:00 7 February when &quot;Growler&quot; stealthily approached the armed food supply vessel &quot;Hayasaki&quot; for a night surface attack. The small fast ship suddenly turned to ram. Unable to avoid the collision, Gilmore ordered left full rudder and all ahead flank, and rammed the enemy amidships at , bending Growler&#x27;s bow 18 feet to the port side.
As machine gun fire raked them at point-blank range, Commander Gilmore ordered the bridge cleared. As the commanding officer, Gilmore was the last to leave the bridge, but was grievously wounded before he could get below. Realizing that he was jeopardizing his boat&#x27;s escape, he ordered &quot;Take her down!&quot;. The executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Arnold F. Schade, shut the hatch and dived the boat. By saving his command at the cost of his own life, Gilmore became the first of seven World War II submariners to earn the Medal of Honor. Ensign William Wadsworth Williams and Fireman Third Class Wilbert Fletcher Kelley also lost their lives in this incident. &quot;Hayasaki&quot; was damaged but not sunk.

Severely damaged but still under control, &quot;Growler&quot; returned to Brisbane under command of Schade; she docked 17 February for extensive repairs. Following the refit, the submarine was nicknamed the &quot;Kangaroo Express&quot;, as the refabricated bow had two nickel kangaroos as decorations.

== Fifth, sixth, and seventh patrols ==
&quot;Growler&quot;’s fifth, sixth, and seventh patrols, out of Brisbane to the Bismarck-Solomons area, were relatively uneventful; heavy enemy air cover and a lack of targets resulted in her coming home empty-handed from all but the fifth, on which she sank the passenger/cargo ship &quot;Miyadono Maru&quot;. During that patrol, an Allied aircraft she identified as a United States Army Air Forces B-26 Marauder bomber attacked her on 27 June 1943, reporting her as a Japanese submarine. The plane&#x27;s bombs landed several miles from &quot;Growler&quot;, and she submerged.

&quot;Growler&quot;&#x27;s seventh patrol was marred by trouble with the storage battery and generators, and on 27 October 1943, only 11 days out of Brisbane, she was ordered to Pearl Harbor (arriving 7 November) and from there to the Navy Yard at Hunter&#x27;s Point, California, for an extensive overhaul and refitting.

== Eighth patrol (February – April 1944) ==
Returning to the Pacific, on 21 February 1944, &quot;Growler&quot; departed Pearl Harbor, and after refueling at Midway Island, headed for her patrol area. However, a week out of Midway Island a typhoon&#x27;s high seas and wind delayed her arrival to the patrol area. Once on station, &quot;Growler&quot; was again plagued by violent weather which made even periscope observation almost impossible. &quot;Growler&quot; returned to Majuro on 16 April.

== Ninth patrol (May – July 1944) ==
The submarine departed Majuro 14 May to take up patrol in the Mariana Islands-Eastern Philippine Islands-Luzon area, where the first stages of the attack on the Mariana Islands and the Battle of the Philippine Sea were getting underway. Rendezvousing with and to form a wolfpack, she continued the patrol closing several targets but achieving firing position only once, when she sank the cargo vessel &quot;Katori Maru&quot;.
== Tenth patrol (August – September 1944) ==

Her tenth patrol, out of Pearl Harbor on 11 August, found her in a new wolf pack, nicknamed &quot;Ben&#x27;s Busters&quot; after &quot;Growler&quot;’s skipper, Commander T.B. (&quot;Ben&quot;) Oakley; in company with and , she headed for the Formosa Straits area. Aided greatly by reconnaissance and guidance from friendly aircraft, the wolf pack closed a convoy for night surface action 31 August; their torpedoes plunged the Japanese into chaos, with their own ships shooting at each other in the dark, but no sinkings were reported. Two weeks later, 12 September, the wolf pack sighted a second convoy and closed for torpedo action. A destroyer spotted &quot;Growler&quot; and attacked her, but the sub calmly fired a spread of torpedoes at the oncoming destroyer. Heavily damaged by the torpedoes, the flaming destroyer bore down on &quot;Growler&quot; and only adroit maneuvering took the submarine out of the enemy&#x27;s way; paint on the bridge was seared by the heat of the passing destroyer. Meantime &quot;Growler&quot;’s other torpedoes and those of &quot;Sealion&quot; and &quot;Pampanito&quot; were hitting the convoy, and when Ben&#x27;s Busters returned to Fremantle submarine base, Western Australia on 26 September, they were credited with a total of six enemy ships. &quot;Growler&quot; had sunk the destroyer &quot;Shikinami&quot; and the frigate &quot;Hirado&quot;; her companions also racked up two kills each. Two of the sunken vessels, &quot;Rakuyo Maru&quot; and &quot;Kachidoki Maru&quot;, were transporting Allied prisoners of the Japanese; the three submarines rescued over 150 Allied prisoners. This difficult operation had been carried out despite rough seas caused by an approaching typhoon.

== Eleventh patrol (October – November 1944) ==
&quot;Growler&quot;’s 11th and final war patrol began from Fremantle on 20 October 1944 in a wolf pack with and . On 8 November the wolf pack, again headed by &quot;Growler&quot;, closed a convoy for attack, with &quot;Growler&quot; on the opposite side of the enemy from &quot;Hake&quot; and &quot;Hardhead&quot;. The order to commence attacking was the last communication ever received from &quot;Growler&quot;. After the attack was underway, &quot;Hake&quot; and &quot;Hardhead&quot; heard what sounded like a torpedo explosion and then a series of depth charges on &quot;Growler&quot;’s side of the convoy, and then nothing. All efforts to contact &quot;Growler&quot; for the next three days proved futile. The submarine, veteran of seven successful war patrols, was listed as lost in action against the enemy, cause unknown. Possibly she was sunk by one of her own torpedoes, but it is probable that she was sunk by the convoy&#x27;s escorts, destroyer &quot;Shigure&quot; and coastal defense ships &quot;Chiburi&quot; and &quot;CD-19&quot;.

== Honors and awards ==
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with eight battle stars for World War II service

==In popular culture==
&quot;Growler&quot; is one of several submarines (along with the era&#x27;s USS &quot;Tang&quot;, &quot;Bowfin&quot;, &quot;Seawolf&quot;, and &quot;Spadefish&quot;) whose war patrols can be re-enacted in the 1985 MicroProse computer game &quot;Silent Service&quot; and the game&#x27;s various ports, including Konami&#x27;s 1989 release for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

A fictionalized and resequenced version of the ramming attack by &quot;Growler&quot; on her fourth patrol features prominently in the John Wayne movie &quot;Operation Pacific&quot;.

<text>Hywel Williams (born 14 May 1953) is a Welsh Plaid Cymru politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Arfon, previously Caernarfon, from 2001 to 2024.

==Early life==
Hywel Williams was born in Pwllheli in 1953, and went to school at Pwllheli Grammar School and then Ysgol Glan y Môr.

He studied Psychology at the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire (now Cardiff University) before qualifying as a social worker at University College of North Wales (now Bangor University) in 1977/78. He was a mental health social worker in the Dwyfor area before joining the Centre for Social Work Practice at the University of Wales, Bangor in 1985.

Williams was a project worker at the centre, specialising in developing practice through the medium of Welsh, developing a host of short courses available in Welsh for the first time, as well as producing and editing numerous books and training packages with his colleagues, including the first ever social work vocabulary in Welsh. He was appointed Head of the Centre in 1993.

In 1995, Williams left to work as a freelance lecturer, consultant and writer in the fields of social policy, social work, and social care, working primarily in Welsh. For the next six years, he worked for a variety of universities and colleges in Wales and abroad, as well as working for public bodies, charities, private companies and local and central government, including spending time as an adviser to the House of Commons Welsh Affairs Committee.

<text>Operation Keyhole was a British special operation to recapture Thule Island in the South Sandwich Islands during the Falklands War. The operation took place from 19 to 20 June 1982.

==Background==
A base, called Corbeta Uruguay, had been built by Argentina in part to reinforce its territorial claims on British-held territory in the South Atlantic. Ostensibly a meteorological research station, it was also used by Argentine military personnel. The British government became aware of the base in December 1976. Between then and the outbreak of the 1982 war, a diplomatic solution to the problem had not been reached.

==Operation==
After the Argentine surrender on the Falkland Islands on 14 June 1982, a task force composed of frigate , patrol ship , tanker RFA &quot;Olmeda&quot; and tug &quot;Salvageman&quot; sailed to the South Sandwich Islands with instructions to end the Argentine presence there.

Reconnaissance parties from &quot;Endurance&quot; and 42 Commando Royal Marines were landed on Thule Island covertly to observe Argentine activities. They encountered harsh conditions on the island with an air temperature of minus 20 degrees Celsius and a gale gusting to , the chill factor caused an effective drop to minus 52 degrees. &quot;Yarmouth&quot; demonstrated her intention by firing her gun and several helicopters flew around the base. Under the threat of the Royal Marines party and the ships cruising in front of the base, the Argentinians raised a white flag. Royal Marines who were forced to lower the Union Flag on South Georgia on 3 April, now hoisted the Union Flag on Thule Island. The final surrender of the war was signed in the wardroom of &quot;Endurance&quot; with all commanders present.

Ten prisoners (one civilian and nine military personnel) were evacuated to the tanker &quot;Olmeda&quot;, accompanied by &quot;Yarmouth&quot; and they departed for South Georgia. The Argentine base &quot;Corbeta Uruguay&quot; was closed and the buildings sealed to make them weatherproof. The other ships &quot;Endurance&quot; and MS &quot;Salvageman&quot; followed and were back at Cumberland East Bay, South Georgia, by 24 June 1982. No deaths or injuries were suffered on either side.

==Aftermath==

In March 1983, a UK spokesman said that on 19 December 1982, the research vessel, HMS &quot;Hecate&quot;, had discovered someone had been back to the base, had lowered the British flag, and raised the Argentinian flag in its place. The spokesman said: &quot;We haven&#x27;t a clue what went on and God only knows who it was—scrap metal merchants, someone in their cups (drunk) or the Argentine military&quot;. To prevent any attempt by Argentina to return to Thule Island, the base was later demolished, in February 1983, by crew from HMS &quot;Ariadne&quot; and the supply ship RFA &quot;Tidespring&quot;. The flagpole, two weather beacons, and a fully provisioned hut were left intact.

<doc id="417665" wikidata="Q413624" url="?curid=417665" title="Cubane">
<text>Cubane is a synthetic hydrocarbon compound with the formula . It consists of eight carbon atoms arranged at the corners of a cube, with one hydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom. A solid crystalline substance, cubane is one of the Platonic hydrocarbons and a member of the prismanes. It was first synthesized in 1964 by Philip Eaton and Thomas Cole. Before this work, Eaton believed that cubane would be impossible to synthesize due to the &quot;required 90 degree bond angles&quot;. The cubic shape requires the carbon atoms to adopt an unusually sharp 90° bonding angle, which would be highly strained as compared to the 109.45° angle of a tetrahedral carbon. Once formed, cubane is quite kinetically stable, due to a lack of readily available decomposition paths. It is the simplest hydrocarbon with octahedral symmetry.

Having high potential energy and kinetic stability makes cubane and its derivative compounds useful for controlled energy storage. For example, octanitrocubane and heptanitrocubane have been studied as high-performance explosives. These compounds also typically have a very high density for hydrocarbon molecules. The resulting high energy density means a large amount of energy can be stored in a comparably smaller amount of space, an important consideration for applications in fuel storage and energy transport. Furthermore, their geometry and stability make them suitable isosteres for benzene rings.

==Synthesis==
The classic 1964 synthesis starts with the conversion of 2-cyclopentenone to 2-bromocyclopentadienone:

Allylic bromination with &quot;N&quot;-bromosuccinimide in carbon tetrachloride followed by addition of molecular bromine to the alkene gives a 2,3,4-tribromocyclopentanone. Treating this compound with diethylamine in diethyl ether causes elimination of two equivalents of hydrogen bromide to give the diene product.

The construction of the eight-carbon cubane framework begins when 2-bromocyclopentadienone undergoes a spontaneous Diels-Alder dimerization. One ketal of the &quot;endo&quot; isomer is subsequently selectively deprotected with aqueous hydrochloric acid to 3.

In the next step, the &quot;endo&quot; isomer 3 (with both alkene groups in close proximity) forms the cage-like isomer 4 in a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition. The bromoketone group is converted to ring-contracted carboxylic acid 5 in a Favorskii rearrangement with potassium hydroxide. Next, the thermal decarboxylation takes place through the acid chloride (with thionyl chloride) and the &quot;tert&quot;-butyl perester 6 (with &quot;tert&quot;-butyl hydroperoxide and pyridine) to 7; afterward, the acetal is once more removed in 8. A second Favorskii rearrangement gives 9, and finally another decarboxylation gives, via 10, cubane (11).

A more approachable laboratory synthesis of disubstituted cubane involves bromination of the ethylene ketal of cyclopentanone to give a tribromocyclopentanone derivative. Subsequent steps involve dehydrobromination, Diels-Alder dimerization, etc.
The resulting cubane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid is used to synthesize other substituted cubanes. Cubane itself can be obtained nearly quantitatively by photochemical decarboxylation of the thiohydroxamate ester (the Barton decarboxylation).

==Derivatives==

The synthesis of the octaphenyl derivative from tetraphenylcyclobutadiene nickel bromide by Freedman in 1962 pre-dates that of the parent compound. It is a sparingly soluble colourless compound that melts at 425–427 °C. A hypercubane, with a hypercube-like structure, was predicted to exist in a 2014 publication. Two isomers of cubene have been synthesized, and a third analyzed computationally. The alkene in &quot;ortho&quot;- is exceptionally reactive due to its pyramidalized geometry. At the time of its synthesis, this was the most pyramidalized alkene to have been made. The &quot;meta&quot;- isomer is even less stable, and the &quot;para&quot;- isomer probably only exists as a diradical rather than an actual diagonal bond.

In 2022, both heptafluorocubane and octafluorocubane were synthesized. Octafluorocubane is of theoretical interest because of its unusual electronic structure, which is indicated by its susceptibility to undergo reduction to a detectable anion , with a free electron trapped inside the cube, in effect making it the world&#x27;s smallest box.

==Cubylcubanes and oligocubanes==
 (1,2-dehydrocubane) and 1,4-cubanediyl(1,4-dehydrocubane) are enormously strained compounds which both undergo nucleophilic addition very rapidly, and this has enabled chemists to synthesize cubylcubane. X-ray diffraction structure solution has shown that the central cubylcubane bond is exceedingly short (1.458 Å), much shorter than the typical C-C single bond (1.578 Å). This is attributed to the fact that the exocyclic orbitals of cubane are s-rich and close to the nucleus. Chemists at the University of Chicago extended and modified the sequence in a way that permits the preparation of a host of [n]cubylcubane oligomers. The [n]cubylcubanes are rigid molecular rods with the particular promise at the time of making liquid crystals with exceptional UV transparency. As the number of linked cubane units increases, the solubility of [n]cubylcubane plunges; as a result, only limited chain length (up to 40 units) have been synthesized in solutions. The skeleton of [n]cubylcubanes is still composed of enormously strained carbon cubes, which therefore limit its stability. In contrast, researchers at Penn State University showed that poly-cubane synthesized by solid-state reaction is 100% sp3 carbon bonded with a tetrahedral angle (109.5°) and exhibits exceptional optical properties (high refractive index).

==Reactions==
Cuneane may be produced from cubane by a metal-ion-catalyzed σ-bond rearrangement.

With a rhodium catalyst, it first forms &quot;syn&quot;-tricyclooctadiene, which can thermally decompose to cyclooctatetraene at 50–60 °C.

<doc id="417666" wikidata="Q158361" url="?curid=417666" title="Rubus spectabilis">
<text>Rubus spectabilis, the salmonberry, is a species of bramble in the rose family Rosaceae, native to the west coast of North America from west-central Alaska to California, inland as far as Idaho. Like many other species in the genus &quot;Rubus&quot;, the salmonberry plant bears edible fruit, typically yellow-orange or red in color, resembling raspberries in appearance.

==Description==
&quot;Rubus spectabilis&quot; is a deciduous, rhizomatous shrub growing to tall and 9 m (30 ft) wide, with a moderate growth rate of 0.3–0.6 m (12–24 inches) per year. 30–40% of the plant&#x27;s biomass is underground. It has perennial (not biennial) woody stems that are covered with fine prickles, especially on new growth. The plant has golden or yellowish brown erect or arching stems (also known as &quot;canes&quot;) that often form thickets, like many other brambles in the genus &quot;Rubus&quot;.

The leaves are alternate, trifoliate (with three leaflets), long and typically ovate in shape, with the terminal leaflet being larger than the two side leaflets, which are sometimes shallowly lobed. The margins of the leaflets are doubly serrate. The leaves are also stipulate and are smooth to slightly hairy on the top surface, compared to the underside, which are typically more pale and hairy. In late fall and winter months, salmonberry leaves will fall, and the plant remains dormant or maintains minimal shoot elongation during the winter.

The flowers are in diameter, with a calyx of five hairy sepals and five pinkish-purple petals that surround a cluster of stamens; they are produced between April and July, either singly or in clusters of 2 or 3. The flowers are perfect (bisexual), containing 75–100 stamens and many individual pistils with superior ovaries. While fruit production is largely dependent on the environment, there is an estimated growth of 30 fruits per and 17–65 seeds per fruit. Salmonberry sprout mainly from the buds found on rhizomes, stumps, and root crowns of the plant. The flowers cannot self-pollinate and are instead pollinated by insects, hummingbirds, and beetles.

Salmonberries ripen approximately 30–36 days after pollination, from early May to late July in most of the Pacific Northwest and July to August in cooler Northern climates. They are long and resemble large shiny yellow to orange-red raspberries. The fruit pulls away from its receptacle, differentiating it from blackberries. Botanically speaking, the salmonberry is not a true berry, but instead an aggregate fruit made of many smaller drupelets. The fruits of the salmonberry plant exhibit polymorphism, as berries are often either red in color or a yellow-orange color. Studies have found that although both red and yellow-orange morphs have similar physical qualities, the red berries are more commonly consumed by birds, although this is likely not a strong enough selective pressure to determine color morph distribution alone; factors such as soil type (which affects germination), along with other unstudied factors are more likely responsible for the color polymorphism.

===Similar species===
A similar species from Japan, the red-flowered raspberry (ベニバナイチゴ) was once considered a subspecies as &quot;R. spectabilis&quot; subsp. &quot;vernus&quot;. It is now reclassified as &quot;R. vernus&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
Salmonberries are typically found in coastal areas with nitrogen-rich soils, in moist to wet forests and streambanks, increasing in abundance in areas of high rainfall and decreasing in abundance at higher elevations and continentality. Ecologically speaking, salmonberry tends to spread quickly and needs plenty of room to grow, and is often dominant and fast-growing in early-seral communities. Its size and population growth decline in abundance as the canopy begins to form, and may also be influenced by other factors such as basal area, plant disturbance, and population density. In open areas they often form large thickets, and are found to associate with stands of red alder (&quot;Alnus rubra&quot;), lady fern (&quot;Athyrium filixfemina&quot;), western skunk cabbage (&quot;Lysichiton americanus&quot;), devil&#x27;s club (&quot;Oplopanax horridus&quot;), thimbleberry (&quot;Rubus parviflorus&quot;), and threeleaf foamflower (&quot;Tiarella trifoliata&quot;).

==Ecology==
In the wild, the fruit are typically eaten by birds, bears, and small mammals, among others, while the leaves, twigs, and stems are grazed on by herbivores such as deer, moose, mountain goats, elk, and rabbits. Populations of dense thicket growth can provide escape habitats for small animals, as well as nesting sites for birds.

In the spring, salmonberry flowering coincides with the migration of certain species of hummingbirds, which is crucial for its pollination. Birds and mammals also help with dispersion of seeds through their feces, while rodents and other burrowing animals may further help with dispersion. Some notable mammals crucial for the dispersion of seeds are the grizzly and American black bears, which can deposit 50,000 to 100,000 seeds in one pile of feces.

Salmonberry have several traits that make it highly resistant to fire. Rhizomes and root crowns below the soil surface usually survive, even if top stems are burned. Depending on burial depth, seeds also often remain unharmed. Additionally, the plant tend to quickly sprout after fires, allowing for rapid growth and regeneration.

Salmonberries are susceptible to many diseases, including mildew, fruit rot, rust, root rot, and viral and bacterial diseases. Their fruits, foliage, canes, roots, and crowns may also be damaged by pests such as beetles, aphids, mites, moths, among others.

==Uses==
Salmonberries are edible. The fruit has been referred to as &quot;diverse, from bright, fruity and citrusy to deep and earthy with spicy notes&quot; and depending on ripeness and site, they are good eaten raw whether red or golden and when processed into jam, candy, jelly and wine. Native American people ate the young shoots or used it as a medicinal plant. The shoots were harvested during April to early June before they turned woody or tough, and were peeled, then steamed, boiled, or pit-cooked, and eaten (or less commonly, eaten raw). Traditionally, the berries and sprouts were also eaten with salmon or mixed with oolichan grease or salmon roe. They were not dried because of their high moisture content. It is still used as a food source and medicinal plant in regions of Alaska today.

Other uses by Native Americans include:

* Boiling the leaves with fish as a flavoring (by the &quot;Nuu-chah-nulth&quot; people)
* Using the leaves to line baskets, wipe fish, and cover cooking pits (by the Kaigani Haida people)
* Using the branches as a pipe stem (by the Makah people)
* Chewing and spitting the leaves (or bark in the winter) onto a burn as a treatment due to their astringent qualities (by the Quileute people)
* Boiling the bark in seawater to create a brew to clean infected wounds (especially burns) as well as reduce labor pains (by the Quinault people)

It is also widely grown as an ornamental plant for its flowers, with a double-flowered clone identified in Washington and British Columbia. &quot;R. spectabilis&quot; has escaped cultivation and become naturalized in parts of northwestern Europe, including Great Britain, Ireland and the Faroe Islands.

== Culture ==
The salmonberry is important to multiple indigenous people of America in its native range. The Makah people call the plant &quot;ka&#x27;k&#x27;we&#x27;abupt&quot; and the berry &quot;ka&#x27;k&#x27;we&quot;; the Cowlitz people call the plant &quot;e&#x27;twanac&quot; and the berry &quot;e&#x27;twan&quot;; speakers of Lower Chinook call it &quot;yunts&quot;. The Squamish people call the plant &quot;yetwánáy&quot; and the berries &quot;yetwán&quot;, the shoots are called &quot;stsá7tskaý&quot; (pronounced &quot;saskay&quot;). In the Saanich dialect, it is called &quot;elile&quot;. The birdsong of the Swainson&#x27;s thrush, sometimes known as the salmonberry bird, is a phenological indicator known to multiple indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest Coast to be associated with the ripening of salmonberries. The birdsong itself is even said to make the berries ripen, as is the case of the Saanich people who give the birdsong the onomatopoeic translation of &quot;xwexwelexwelexwelexwesh!&quot; meaning &quot;ripen, ripen, ripen, ripen!&quot; This belief is also widespread and is known to the Tlingit, Haida, Haisla, Oweekeno, Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw, Nuu-Chah-Nulth, Ditidaht, Sḵwx̱wú7mesh, and the Straits Salish people. The presence of &quot;Elasmostethus cruciatus&quot;, called the salmonberry bug, is also seen as an indicator to Northwest Coast indigenous peoples that salmonberry shoots are ready to harvest.

<text>The lap desk is a desk set in the lap. In the European tradition, it can be considered a modern form of the portable desk.

==Antique lap desk==
As an antique the lap desk is a smaller variant of the writing slope. It is also called a writing box or a writing cabinet. In certain instances it is known as a portable desk, a term which is usually applied to larger forms. Most antique lap desks are meant to be used on a table or some other stable surface. They are often strongly built of fine hardwoods like mahogany or walnut.

Antique lap desks had hinged writing surfaces, often covered in leather, felt, or other material, that flip up to reveal storage space for papers. Individual compartments were designed to hold inkwells, pens, sealing wax, and other contemporary writing materials. Some desks also had concealed storage compartments.

==Modern lap desk==
As a modern form the lap desk is meant primarily for use in bed and other similar circumstances, it is also known as a bed desk. There are a wide variety of forms available, but as a rule it is much smaller and simpler than the antique lap desk, having at the most a small drawer or holding area for a ballpoint pen and a pencil. It is also made of much cheaper materials, save for a few craft productions.

Certain lap desks have a removable monopod, which makes them collapsible cousins to the lectern desk. Others have two short collapsible legs, so that they can be used both in bed and on a lap, when the legs are folded. Finally, some come with a built-in battery powered lamp, continuing the tradition of those antique lap desks and writing slopes which had swinging or hinged brass candle holders built in. Some new lap desks now have a built-in cup holder.

Most modern lap desks are considered specialty items and very few furniture dealers keep them in stock. They are present, however, in a large number of catalogs and on some commercial Web sites.

There are also lap desks made for laptop computers. These desks were designed not only to raise the laptops from their surrounding environments (such as beds), but they were also designed to provide extra clearances to provide adequate air circulation to the laptops. Some of them are also equipped with extra fans to increase air circulation.

<text>¡Viva El Amor! (Spanish for &quot;Long Live Love&quot;) is the seventh studio album by the rock band the Pretenders, released in 1999. The band&#x27;s lineup for the album is the same as that credited on 1994&#x27;s &quot;Last of the Independents&quot;: Chrissie Hynde (vocals, guitar), Martin Chambers (drums), Andy Hobson (bass) and Adam Seymour (guitar). This time, however, the credited line-up actually plays on most of the album, although Hobson is replaced on bass by session musicians on a few cuts.

The album, featuring a cover photograph of Hynde taken by friend Linda McCartney, saw moderate success in the United States and the United Kingdom. Its two lead singles were &quot;Popstar&quot; and &quot;Human&quot;, the latter a Divinyls cover. The Class Mix of &quot;Human&quot; was used as the theme music to the short-lived American TV series &quot;Cupid&quot; as well as featuring in the soundtrack to the Brenda Blethyn film &quot;Saving Grace&quot;. The album charted in the UK, US and Sweden.

<text>Luffield Abbey is a former civil parish, now in the parish of Lillingstone Dayrell with Luffield Abbey, in the very north of Buckinghamshire, England. It is on the border with Northamptonshire, close to Biddlesden and Silverstone.

== Priory of Luffield ==

The place takes its name from the Benedictine priory of Luffield, founded by Robert, 2nd Earl of Leicester some time before 1133. The priory was suppressed in 1494, by which time the priory was in ruins and there were only two monks. The lands were then granted to Westminster Abbey.

There was no trace of the ancient abbey in a land survey conducted in 1732. The remains of the abbey were found on the edge of the south east runway of the airfield which is now part of Silverstone Circuit, about 200 metres north east of Stowe Corner. Markings of the foundations can be seen in discolorations in the grass on some aerial images taken in the early 1990s. Human remains were found near the abbey in the 1970s. They were found to be monks who had been sufferers of the plague and buried face down.

Two corners of the circuit are named after the location: turn 1 is known as Abbey and turn 7 as Luffield.

== Subsequent history ==
In 1551, after the Dissolution, the manor was granted to Francis Throckmorton. In 1718 it passed to his descendant Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham of Stowe, and passed with the Stowe estates until the mid 19th century.

Luffield Abbey was an extra-parochial area, until 1844 partly in Northamptonshire and partly in Buckinghamshire. In 1844 the part in the former county was transferred to the Northamptonshire parish of Silverstone so that Luffield Abbey was entirely within Buckinghamshire thereafter. In 1858 it became a separate civil parish.

The parish consisted of a single farm. By 1931 the population of the parish had dropped to 2. In 1971 the parish had a population of 0. On 1 April 2001 the parish was abolished and merged with Lillingstone Dayrell to form &quot;Lillingstone Dayrell with Luffield Abbey&quot;. The name was also given to the northernmost ward of the former Aylesbury Vale District Council.

<doc id="417670" wikidata="Q1358112" url="?curid=417670" title="Hugh Shelton">
<text>Henry Hugh Shelton (born 2 January 1942) is a former United States Army officer who served as the 14th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1997 to 2001.

==Early life, family and education==
Shelton was born in Tarboro, North Carolina and graduated from North Edgecombe High School in 1959. Shelton attended North Carolina State University, and was a member of Pershing Rifles. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in textile engineering in 1963 while earning his Army commission through Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps training. Shelton&#x27;s further education includes a Master of Science degree in political science from Auburn University at Montgomery in 1973 as well as studies at the Air Command and Staff College from August 1972 to June 1973 and the National War College from June 1982 to June 1983. Shelton married Carolyn L. Johnson in 1963; the pair have three sons together.

==Military service==
Shelton served two tours of duty in the Vietnam War with the 5th Special Forces Group, and with the 173rd Airborne Brigade, followed by a series of command and staff assignments. Following the Gulf War, Shelton commanded the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg in his home state of North Carolina. In 1993, he was given command of XVIII Airborne Corps. Shelton led the Joint Task Force responsible for Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti in 1994. In 1996, Shelton, a Special Forces soldier, was promoted to the rank of general and the position of Commander in Chief of United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM). He was the first Graduate of the U.S. Army Special Forces Program to command SOCOM.

Upon the retirement of John M. Shalikashvili, Shelton was appointed as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff by President Bill Clinton and Secretary of Defense William Cohen on 1 October 1997.

Shelton led the planning of the Kosovo War in 1999 during his time in office. Later he coined the phrase &quot;Dover test&quot;, testing the support for a war based on the reaction of the people after seeing American casualties returning at the Dover Air Force Base. During the events of 11 September 2001, Shelton was flying on-board Boeing C-135 Speckled Trout, traveling to a NATO meeting in Europe, but turned back and returned to Washington. Upon entering the United States Airspace, the C-135 flew past the World Trade Center so Shelton was able to assess the situation following the attack. Already scheduled to retire in October, Shelton spent his last weeks in office coordinating military plans to destroy al-Qaeda and Taliban forces in Afghanistan and helping to develop an interagency strategy to defeat, disrupt, and degrade terrorist activities around the world. These would form the basis of Operation Enduring Freedom and the global War on Terror. Upon Shelton&#x27;s end of term, President George W. Bush nominated then-Vice Chairman Air Force General Richard Myers, who was sworn in on 1 October 2001.

==Post-military career==
In 2002 Shelton founded the General Hugh Shelton Leadership Center at North Carolina State University. The center was created to &quot;inspire, educate, and develop values-based leaders, both locally and globally, committed to personal integrity, professional ethics, and selfless service.&quot;

In his retirement, Shelton joined the Board of Directors of Red Hat in April 2003, and was elected that board&#x27;s chairman in 2010. He also holds directorships at Anheuser Busch, Anteon International and Protective Products of America. At his alma mater of North Carolina State University, the General Hugh Shelton Leadership Center was founded in 2002, which grants scholarships to people who are committed to personal integrity, professional ethics, and selfless service.

Shelton also served as an advisor to Senator John Edwards&#x27; presidential campaign from 2003 to 2004. Shelton created a minor controversy for 2004 Democratic presidential candidate, retired U.S. Army General Wesley Clark, a subordinate of Shelton&#x27;s during the 1999 Kosovo military actions, when he stated: &quot;I will tell you the reason [Clark] came out of Europe early had to do with integrity and character issues, things that are very near and dear to my heart. I&#x27;ll just say Wes won&#x27;t get my vote,&quot; casting doubt upon Clark&#x27;s candidacy.

On 1 March 2008, Shelton announced his endorsement of Senator Hillary Clinton for the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary, stating, &quot;I&#x27;ve been with Senator Clinton when she has been with our military men and women. I know from those experiences that she understands the demands and sacrifice of military life. I am confident she will always put the readiness and well being of our troops first. She is ready to be Commander-in-Chief.&quot; Shelton was the second Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to endorse Clinton, the first being General John Shalikashvili.

On 12 October 2010, Shelton published his autobiography, &quot;Without Hesitation: The Odyssey of an American Warrior&quot;, along with coauthors Ron Levinson and Malcolm McConnell. An excerpt tells the story of a high-ranking Clinton Cabinet member proposing that Shelton intentionally allow an American pilot to be killed by the Iraqis to have an excuse to retaliate and go to war. The book also tells of Bill Clinton&#x27;s tearful confession to Shelton; a time during the Clinton administration when a close Clinton aide lost possession of the biscuit (top secret presidential nuclear launch authorization codes); details of a contentious Camp David meeting among George W. Bush and his National Security Council immediately after 9/11, where internal battle lines were drawn. His book also says there were multiple attempts to kill Osama bin Laden that were shot down by Madeleine Albright.

On 27 August 2010, a statue of Shelton was unveiled and dedicated at the Airborne Special Operations Museum in Fayetteville, NC. The statue was commissioned and donated by H. Ross Perot.

On 24 October 2010, Shelton appeared on &quot;This Week with Christiane Amanpour&quot;, on 6 December 2010, on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; with Jon Stewart, and on 30 December 2010, on &quot;The Charlie Rose Show&quot; on PBS and Bloomberg TV, to promote the publication of his memoir.

On 20 October 2012, Shelton was honored at the 6th Annual Brian &amp; Kendra&#x27;s Bluegrass Party in Speed, North Carolina. He was presented with a Distinguished Achievements plaque and a roadside display at the entrance of Speed, honoring his hometown and acknowledging his achievements.

Shelton and his wife, Carolyn, established the Hugh and Carolyn Shelton Military Neurotrauma Foundation in 2005 to fund research into traumatic brain injury among military personnel.

===Other Recognition===
In 1998, Shelton received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council members General Colin L. Powell and General John M. Shalikashvili.

In 2002, Shelton received the Congressional Gold Medal. The citation says, &quot;Throughout his 38 years of service to his country, his ascent through the ranks of the Army, two tours in Vietnam and duty in Operation Desert Storm, Gen. Shelton has carried with him the North Carolina values of service, sacrifice, love of family, faith in God and devotion to country.&quot;

In 2011, The Command and General Staff College Foundation presented retired General Hugh Shelton with the Foundation&#x27;s 2011 Distinguished Leadership Award.

<text>Operations Black Buck 1 to Black Buck 7 were seven extremely long-range airstrikes conducted during the 1982 Falklands War by Royal Air Force (RAF) Vulcan bombers of the RAF Waddington Wing, comprising aircraft from 44, 50 and 101 Squadrons, against Argentine positions in the Falkland Islands. Five of the missions completed attacks. The objective of the missions was to attack Port Stanley Airport and its associated defences. The raids, at almost and 16 hours for the round trip, were the longest-ranged bombing raids in history at that time.

The Operation Black Buck raids were staged from RAF Ascension Island, close to the Equator. The Vulcan was designed for medium-range missions in Europe and lacked the range to fly to the Falklands without refuelling several times. The RAF&#x27;s tanker planes were mostly converted Handley Page Victor bombers with similar range, so they too had to be refuelled in the air. A total of eleven tankers were required for two Vulcans (one primary and one reserve), a daunting logistical effort as all aircraft had to use the same runway.

The Vulcans carried either twenty-one bombs internally or two or four Shrike anti-radar missiles externally. Of the five Black Buck raids flown to completion, three were against Stanley Airfield&#x27;s runway and operational facilities, while the other two were anti-radar missions using Shrike missiles against a Westinghouse AN/TPS-43 long-range 3D radar in the Port Stanley area. Shrikes hit two of the less valuable and rapidly replaced secondary fire control radars, causing some casualties among the Argentine crews. One Vulcan was almost lost when a breakdown of its refueling system forced it to land in Brazil.

The raids did minimal damage to the runway and damage to radars was quickly repaired. A single crater was produced on the runway, rendering it impossible for the airfield to be used by fast jets. Argentinian ground crew repaired the runway within twenty-four hours, to a level of quality suitable for C-130 Hercules transports. The British were aware that the runway remained in use. It has been suggested that the Black Buck raids were undertaken by the RAF because the British armed forces had been cut in the late 1970s and the RAF may have desired a greater role in the conflict to prevent further cuts.

==Background==
During the early 1980s, British defence planning was focused on the Cold War confrontation with the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, at six-monthly intervals the Defence chiefs reviewed other possible areas of conflict around the globe, including the Falkland Islands. The consensus was that they were indefensible. The nearest airfield usable for operations was on Ascension Island, a British territory in the South Atlantic not far from the equator with a single runway at Wideawake airfield that lay from the UK and from the Falklands. Without aircraft able to cover the long distance, the Royal Air Force (RAF) could not envisage carrying out operations in the South Atlantic. Activities in the South Atlantic would be carried out by the Royal Navy and the British Army, with the RAF&#x27;s role restricted to the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft and logistic support of the base at Ascension by Vickers VC10 and Lockheed C-130 Hercules transport aircraft.

Argentine codes had been broken, and in March 1982 intelligence warnings about possible Argentine activity in the South Atlantic accumulated. The RAF began examining whether it was possible to carry out long-range operations with Avro Vulcan bombers using aerial refuelling. In 1961, a Vulcan had flown non-stop from the UK to RAAF Base Richmond near Sydney in Australia, a much greater distance, but that was with pre-positioned aerial tankers along the route, which would not be possible flying from Ascension. All consideration at this point was about how it could be done; no targets were identified in the Falklands or Argentina.

After Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands on 2 April 1982, the British Government resolved to recapture them.

===Victor tankers===
Long-range operations were entirely dependent upon the RAF&#x27;s fleet of Handley Page Victor K2 tankers. Originally 34 Victors had been built as bombers; 24 had subsequently been converted to tankers. One had been lost in an accident at RAF Marham on 28 September 1976, leaving the RAF with a force of just 23. These were the only tankers in British service in April 1982; nine VC10s were in the process of being converted to tankers, but conversion of the first was not completed until 22 June. Of these, twelve were assigned to No. 55 Squadron and eleven to No. 57 Squadron.
The tanker crews were well-trained for their wartime role, as their peacetime role involved refuelling fighters scrambled in response to incursions into British airspace, usually by bombers from the Soviet Union at a rate of five per week. However, long-range flights over the unfamiliar South Atlantic Ocean necessitated upgrades to the Victors&#x27; navigational equipment, notably the installation of the Delco Carousel inertial navigation system and the Omega navigation system. The tankers were themselves capable of being refuelled in flight, which meant that it was possible to set up relays of aircraft.

The first five Victors deployed to Ascension on 18 April. They were followed by four more the following day. Another six more deployed by the end of the month, bringing the Victor tanker force to fourteen, since one had returned to Marham on 26 April. Each was refuelled by another Victor before leaving UK airspace. While the Victors deployed to Ascension, their normal refuelling mission in the air was undertaken by United States Air Force Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers. The station commander at Marham, Group Captain J. S. B. Price, became the senior RAF officer at Ascension. Wing Commander D. W. Maurice-Jones assumed command of the Victor detachment at Ascension until 22 April, when he was relieved by Wing Commander A. W. Bowman, the commander of No. 57 Squadron.

Initial long-range operations by the RAF involved the use of Victor aircraft for reconnaissance of the region surrounding South Georgia Island in support of Operation Paraquet, the recapture of South Georgia. At 0400Z on 20 April, a Victor piloted by Squadron Leader J. G. Elliott, took off from Ascension, accompanied by four supporting tankers to supply fuel for the outbound journey. Another flight of four tankers supplied fuel for the return journey. Two more reconnaissance missions to the South Georgia area were carried out on 22–23 April and on 24–25 April. These missions demonstrated the capability of the Victor tanker fleet, flying out of Ascension, to support operations in the South Atlantic.

===Vulcan bombers===

The Vulcan was the last of the British V bombers in operational use for bombing, but by March 1982 there were only three squadrons remaining, Nos. 44, 50 and 101 Squadrons RAF. All three were scheduled to be disbanded by 1 July 1982. They were based at RAF Waddington in the UK and assigned to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for nuclear operations; neither aerial refuelling nor conventional bombing had been practised for several years. A request from Rear Admiral Sandy Woodward, the commander of the British aircraft carrier group heading south, on 11 April for recommendations for targets to attack in the Falkland Islands led to reconsideration of the possibility of attacks using Vulcans. Options for attacks on airfields and ports on the Argentine mainland were discarded as politically provocative and unlikely to produce worthwhile results. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Beetham argued that the Vulcan threat would cause the Argentinians to retain fighters in the north of Argentina.

Thinking coalesced on a raid on Port Stanley Airport. Whether it would be worth the effort was debated. Beetham initially proposed an attack in which a single Vulcan would drop seven bombs. This light bomb load would keep the refuelling requirements down to a minimum. However, tests conducted at the Garvie Island bombing range indicated that seven bombs would not be enough, but a full load of twenty-one would have a 90 per cent probability of putting one crater in the runway, with a 75 per cent chance of two craters. An attack was also expected to do damage to the dispersal areas and aircraft parked nearby. To minimise the danger from anti-aircraft guns and surface-to-air missiles, the raids would be carried out at night, preferably in bad weather. Damage to the surrounding area, possibly including parked aircraft, would make the raid worthwhile. While the Chiefs of Staff Committee were convinced that the operation was feasible and stood a good chance of success, the civilians at the Ministry of Defence were not so certain, and there were political implications to using the base at Ascension for offensive purposes, as Wideawake was technically a USAF base. The United States Department of State was consulted, and affirmed that it had no objection. Authority to proceed with the operation, codenamed Black Buck, was given by the War Cabinet on 27 April.
The most controversial part of the plan was the involvement of Sea Harriers from Woodward&#x27;s task force. One of the reasons for the use of the Vulcans was to conserve Sea Harrier resources for the air defence of the naval forces, but the plan required them to conduct a daylight photo reconnaissance sortie over the airfield for the purpose of damage assessment. If they had to be risked, then there were political advantages in using them to carry out the attack on the airport instead. Rear Admiral Derek Reffell proposed that Harriers be used to suppress the airfield radars prior to the Vulcan attack in addition to conducting the post-attack photo reconnaissance. On 29 April, Woodward was informed that the Black Buck raid would occur at 0700Z, and that he was to arrange for the photo reconnaissance to take place as soon as possible afterwards. Woodward signalled that if the photo reconnaissance was essential to Black Buck, then his recommendation was that Black Buck should be cancelled. The following day he was informed that Black Buck had been approved, and that the photo reconnaissance was required not just for damage assessment, but to refute Argentine allegations of indiscriminate bombing.

Vulcans were selected based upon their engines; only those with the more powerful Bristol Olympus 301 engines were considered suitable. Six aircraft were selected: two each from Nos. 44, 50 and 101 Squadrons. In the event, one was not used. Five crews were chosen, one each from Nos. 44 and 101 Squadrons, two from No. 50 Squadron, and one from the recently disbanded No. 9 Squadron. An air-to-air instructor from the operational conversion unit responsible for training personnel to operate Victor tankers was added to each Vulcan crew during operational missions; this officer was responsible for supervising the refuelling contacts.

One of the most challenging tasks was reinstating the aerial refuelling system, which had been blocked off. This involved replacing the non-return valves. Twenty replacements were located on a shelf at RAF Stafford. The five aircraft were fitted with the Carousel inertial navigation system. AN/ALQ-101 electronic countermeasure pods from Blackburn Buccaneer aircraft at RAF Honington were fitted to the wings of the Vulcans on improvised pylons, using the attachment points originally intended for the Skybolt missile. The undersides of the aircraft were painted Dark Sea Grey.
While the Vulcans were capable of carrying conventional munitions, this had not been done for a long time. To carry twenty-one bombs, the Vulcan required three sets of bomb carriers, each of which held seven bombs. Their release was controlled by a panel at the navigator&#x27;s station, known as a &quot;90-way&quot;, that monitored the electrical connections to each bomb, and was said to provide 90 different sequences for releasing the 1,000-pound bombs. None of the Vulcans at Waddington were fitted with the bomb racks or the 90-way. A search of the supply dumps at Waddington and RAF Scampton located the 90-way panels, which were fitted and tested, but finding enough septuple bomb carriers proved harder, and at least nine were required. Someone remembered that some had been sold to a scrapyard in Newark-on-Trent, and they were retrieved from there. Locating sufficient bombs also proved difficult, and only 167 could be located. Some had cast bomb cases rather than machined ones, which was problematic as they tended to shatter, and this mission required bombs that would penetrate into the ground. Training of crews in conventional bombing and in-flight refuelling was carried out from 14 to 17 April, when Military Air Traffic Controllers from the Military Area Service (M.A.S.) suite at London Terminal Control Centre in West Drayton, Middlesex, took the Vulcan bombers and Victor tankers 250 miles off Land&#x27;s End in the Atlantic Ocean, where the vast majority of their aerial refuelling training was completed, always at night.

The first two Vulcans, commanded by Squadron Leader John Reeve, and Flight Lieutenant Martin Withers, left Waddington at 0900Z on 29 April and arrived at Wideawake at 1800Z after a non-stop nine-hour flight during which they were twice refuelled by Victor tankers. Two other Vulcans subsequently deployed to Wideawake: one commanded by Squadron Leader Alastair Montgomery arrived on 14 May, and another, commanded by Squadron Leader Neil McDougall, on 27 May. It carried out trials with the Martel anti-radar missile before being equipped with the Shrike missile.

===Summary===
===Black Buck One===

The first surprise attack on the islands, on 30 April – 1 May, was the first significant offensive action made by British forces against the Argentine forces in the Falklands. It was aimed at the main runway at Port Stanley Airport. Carrying twenty-one 1,000-pound bombs, the bomber was to fly across the line of the runway at about 35 degrees. The bomb release system was timed to drop bombs sequentially from , so that at least one bomb would hit the runway. The Vulcan&#x27;s fuel tanks could contain weighing in fourteen pressurised bag tanks, five in each wing and four in the fuselage. Based upon estimates of the Vulcan&#x27;s fuel need, eleven Victor tankers, including two reserve aircraft, were assigned to refuel the single Vulcan before and after its attack on the Falklands. Two Vulcans were assigned to the mission: one, commanded by Reeve, was the lead with another, captained by Withers, as the reserve, which would return to Ascension once Reeve had successfully completed its first aerial refuelling. The plan called for 15 Victor sorties and 18 aerial refuellings. At the time it was the longest bombing mission ever attempted. (B-2 Spirit bombers would surpass that record during the 2001 Operation Enduring Freedom.)

The eleven Victors and two Vulcans began taking off from Wideawake at 2350Z at one-minute intervals, with Reeve&#x27;s Vulcan the eleventh to lift off and Withers&#x27;s the last. With a full load of bombs and fuel, a sixth crew member and a fresh coat of paint, the Vulcans were well over their rated maximum takeoff weight of . On the warm Ascension Island, the Bristol Olympus 301 engines had to be run at 103 per cent of their rated power in order to get the Vulcans airborne. Shortly after takeoff, Reeve suffered a failure. A rubber seal on the captain&#x27;s &quot;direct vision&quot; side window had perished. Unable to close or seal the window and pressurise the crew cabin, he was forced to return to Ascension. The Vulcan lacked the ability to dump fuel, and it was far too heavy even for an emergency landing, so the crew were forced to remain airborne in a cold and noisy cabin until sufficient fuel had been consumed. Withers took over as the primary Vulcan. Twenty minutes later, one of the Victor tankers returned to Ascension with a faulty refuelling hose system, and its place was taken by the reserve.
In the 34 minutes between the first and second refuellings, Withers&#x27;s Vulcan burned through of fuel, at the rate of per hour. All this time its weight never dropped below the theoretical maximum. At the end of the second refuelling, two more tankers peeled off and returned, reducing the force to just three: Withers&#x27;s Vulcan, a Victor flown by Squadron Leader Bob Tuxford, and a Victor flown by Flight Lieutenant Steve Biglands. As a result of the fuel demand and problems in flight with refuelling, two of the Victors had to fly further south than planned, reducing their own reserves. At the final refuelling bracket, the sortie flew into a violent thunderstorm, during which Biglands&#x27;s refuelling probe failed.

Tuxford was supposed to return after this refuelling with of fuel while Biglands flew on with the Vulcan, but Tuxford now took Biglands&#x27;s place. A quick calculation showed that he did not have enough fuel to make it back to Ascension. It fell to Tuxford to conduct the final refuelling. Withers received less than he expected. This meant that he would be making the return fuelling rendezvous with in his tanks instead of .

Now alone, Withers flew on to the Falklands. He made his approach at low level, dropping to before climbing to for the bomb run from the target. To verify their position and minimise the risk of civilian casualties, the H2S radar was successfully locked on to the peak of Mount Usborne, west of Stanley, before the automated bombing control system was engaged. Withers made the final approach at , with an airspeed of . The Vulcan&#x27;s electronic countermeasures defeated the radar systems controlling the defending Skyguard anti-aircraft cannons. The twenty-one bombs were dropped. Once all were away, Withers put the Vulcan into a 60-degree bank to the left, subjecting the crew to , twice the force of gravity. Sea Harriers of 801 Naval Air Squadron (NAS) were held at readiness on board the aircraft carrier to protect the Vulcan, but were not required as no Argentine aircraft were in the area at the time of the attack. The Sea Harriers went into action shortly after the Vulcan raid. Two of the aircraft flew over Port Stanley airport to photograph the damage caused by the Vulcan.

Withers climbed away from the airfield and headed nearly due north to a planned rendezvous with a Victor some way off the Brazilian coast near Rio de Janeiro. As they passed the British Task Force, the crew signalled the code word &quot;superfuse&quot; indicating a successful attack at 0746Z. Their journey continued within range of the South American coast to the rendezvous with a Victor flown by Squadron Leader Barry Neal. After contacting control with an update, the tanker was sent further south. To help bring the two planes together, one of Ascension&#x27;s two Nimrod maritime reconnaissance aircraft flew from Wideawake to the area. Without an in-flight refuelling system, it was unable to remain for long. Tuxford, who had continued to maintain radio silence lest he compromise the mission, picked up the &quot;superfuse&quot; signal and radioed Ascension for help. A Victor flown by his squadron commander, Wing Commander Colin Seymour, flew out to meet him, and refuelled Tuxford&#x27;s Victor, enabling him to return to Ascension 14 hours and 5 minutes after he had left. Meanwhile, with the help of the Nimrod, Withers made the rendezvous with Neal, and all three aircraft returned to Ascension safely. Withers touched down at 1452Z.
Northwood Headquarters received the &quot;superfuse&quot; message by 0830Z and the Ministry of Defence shortly thereafter. Beetham was informed by his deputy, Air Vice Marshal Kenneth Hayr, an hour later. The news of the bombing raid was reported on the BBC World Service before either the Vulcan or the last tanker arrived back at Ascension. The bombardment is believed to have killed three Argentinian personnel at the airport and injured several more. One bomb exploded on the runway and caused a large crater which proved difficult to repair, and the other bombs caused minor damage to aircraft and equipment. The shortened runway remained in action.

Later that morning, twelve 800 Naval Air Squadron Sea Harriers were dispatched from the aircraft carrier to attack targets on East Falkland. Nine of the aircraft struck Port Stanley Airport and dropped 27 bombs on the airfield and its defences. The bombs set a stockpile of fuel on fire and may have slightly damaged the runway. One of the Sea Harriers was struck by a 20 mm anti-aircraft round, which damaged its fin and tailplane; the aircraft managed to return to &quot;Hermes&quot; and was quickly repaired. The Argentine air defence headquarters incorrectly assessed British losses as three aircraft destroyed.

The other three 800 NAS Sea Harriers attacked the airfield at Goose Green with cluster bombs shortly after the raid on Port Stanley, resulting in the destruction of a Pucará and severe damage to another two. The pilot of the destroyed aircraft and five maintenance personnel were killed. Neither of the two damaged aircraft flew again. The three British aircraft did not encounter any opposition and safely returned to &quot;Hermes&quot;. After the aircraft were refuelled, 800 NAS began launching Sea Harriers on combat air patrol sorties. 801 NAS maintained a four-aircraft combat air patrol to the east of Port Stanley throughout the operation.

On 8 October 1982, Withers was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his part in the action, and his crew—Flying Officer P. I. Taylor (co-pilot), Flight Lieutenant R. D. Wright (radar plotter), Flight Lieutenant G. C. Graham (navigator), Flight Lieutenant H. Prior (air electronics officer) and Flight Lieutenant R. J. Russell (air-to-air refuelling instructor)—were Mentioned in Dispatches. Tuxford was awarded the Air Force Cross, while his crew—Squadron Leader E. F. Wallis, Flight Lieutenant M. E. Beer, Flight Lieutenant J. N. Keable and Flight Lieutenant G. D. Rees—received the Queen&#x27;s Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air.

===Black Buck Two===
During the night of 3–4 May, a Vulcan flown by Squadron Leader John Reeve and his crew of No. 50 Squadron, flew a near-identical mission to the first. This time, a Vulcan piloted by Squadron Leader Alastair Montgomery, acted as flying reserve aircraft, but was not required. As with Black Buck One, the approach to Port Stanley over the final was made at low altitude, with a final &quot;pop-up&quot; to a higher altitude, , for the bomb run in order to avoid the now fully alert Argentine anti-aircraft defences, particularly the Argentine Roland surface-to-air missiles. As a result, all the bombs missed the runway. This was not known for several days, as the weather conditions precluded photo-reconnaissance missions. According to Argentine sources, which also confirm impacts near the western end of the airstrip, two Argentine soldiers were wounded. The cratering at the western end of the runway prevented Argentine engineers from extending it sufficiently to make it capable of accommodating high-performance combat aircraft. The runway remained in use by Hercules and light transport aircraft, allowing the Argentinians to fly in critical supplies and evacuate wounded personnel.

===Black Buck Three===
Following Black Buck Two there was a break in Vulcan operations as the tankers were needed to support submarine-hunting missions conducted by Nimrods; each Nimrod sortie to protect the naval task force required 18 supporting tanker sorties. The two Vulcans returned to Waddington on 7 May, but one redeployed to Wideawake on 15 May to be the primary aircraft for Black Buck Three. Another, that had arrived from Waddington on 14 May, was the reserve aircraft for the mission. Scheduled for 16 May, Black Buck Three was cancelled before takeoff due to strong headwinds. The two Vulcans returned to Waddington on 20 and 23 May.

===Black Buck Four===

The Black Buck Four mission was due to be the first using American-supplied Shrike anti-radar missiles, which were mounted on the Vulcans using improvised underwing pylons. These weapons had not previously been used by Vulcans, but arrangements for fitting them to the aircraft and the trials program were completed in just ten days. Vulcans equipped with Shrike allowed the Vulcan to carry an additional of fuel in bomb bay tanks, which extended their range and reduced the number of refuelling contacts needed on the flight to the Falklands to four.

The primary aircraft was a Vulcan flown by Squadron Leader Neil McDougall and his crew from No. 50 Squadron that arrived at Wideawake on 27 May, with Montgomery flying the reserve aircraft. The mission was scheduled for 28 May, but was also cancelled, but only some five hours after they had taken off. One of the supporting Victor refuelling aircraft suffered a failure of the hose-and-drogue refuelling unit, and the flight had to be recalled.

===Black Buck Five===
Black Buck Five was flown by McDougall with Montgomery reprising his role flying the reserve aircraft. This was the first completed anti-radar mission equipped with Shrike missiles. The main target was a Westinghouse AN/TPS-43 long-range 3D radar that the Argentine Air Force deployed during April to guard the airspace surrounding the Falkland Islands. The warning that this radar gave enabled the Argentine defenders to conceal mobile Exocet missile launchers. It also gave Argentine Hercules transports the warning they needed to continue using the runway at Stanley. An attack on the radar with Shrike missiles could only succeed if the targeted radar continued transmitting until struck, so a Sea Harrier raid was staged to coincide with the attack to force the defenders to turn on the radar. At 0845Z two Shrikes were launched at it. The first missile impacted from the target, causing minor blast damage, but not disabling the radar. The second missile missed by a greater margin.

===Black Buck Six===

Black Buck Six was flown on 3 June by McDougall, whose Vulcan was now armed with four Shrike missiles instead of just two. Montgomery again flew the reserve aircraft. McDougall loitered over the target for 40 minutes in a vain effort to engage the AN/TPS-43, which was not switched on. Finally, the crew fired two of the four Shrikes, which destroyed a Skyguard fire-control radar of the Argentine Army&#x27;s 601 Anti-Aircraft Battalion, killing four radar operators.

On its return flight McDougall was forced to divert to Rio de Janeiro after his in-flight refuelling probe broke. One of the missiles he was carrying was ditched into the ocean to reduce drag, but the other remained stuck on the pylon and could not be released. Sensitive documents containing classified information were jettisoned into the sea via the crew hatch, and a &quot;Mayday&quot; signal was sent. Two Northrop F-5E Tiger II fighters from 2° Esquadrão do 1° Grupo de Aviação de Caça of the Brazilian Air Force were scrambled from Santa Cruz Airfield and intercepted the Vulcan. The aircraft was cleared to land at Galeão Airport by Brazilian authorities with less than of fuel remaining, not enough to complete a circuit of the airport.

This was a potentially embarrassing international incident, as it revealed that the United States had supplied the British with Shrike missiles. British diplomats negotiated for the release of the Vulcan and its crew, who were interned at Galeão Air Force Base. A deal was struck on 4 June under which they would be released in exchange for spare parts for Westland Lynx helicopters. Brazil came under pressure from Argentina, and the United States agreed to intervene to preserve the secrets of the Shrike missile. The crew and aircraft were permitted to fly to Ascension on 10 June. A new refuelling probe was fitted there, and the aircraft flew back to Waddington on 13 June. The remaining Shrike missile remained in Brazil.

===Black Buck Seven===
The final Black Buck mission was flown on 12 June by Withers, and with the same crew as for Black Buck One except that Flight Lieutenant Peter Standing acted as Air-to-Air Refuelling Instructor instead of Russell. Montgomery once again flew the reserve aircraft. This time the mission targeted Argentine troop positions and facilities around the airport instead of the runway. The bombs were fused in error to explode on impact; the end of the war was in sight and the intention had been for them to air burst to destroy aircraft and stores without damaging the runway, which would soon be needed for RAF Phantom FGR.2 operations after the Falkland Islands were recaptured. In the event, all 21 bombs missed the intended targets. The Argentine ground forces surrendered two days later.

==Effect==

The military effectiveness of Black Buck remains controversial, with some independent sources describing it as &quot;minimal&quot;. The runway continued to be used by Argentine C-130 Hercules transport aircraft until the end of the war, although after 1 May only of supplies and 340 troops were delivered, and early flights were suspended after 4 May, as Black Buck missions occurred in the early morning hours. Woodward has stated that he &quot;fully expected&quot; Hercules flights to continue after Black Buck One, but that he &quot;did not care too much about that&quot; at the time since, unlike fast jets, they were not a direct threat to the naval forces. The British were aware that Hercules flights continued to use the airfield and attempted to interdict these flights, leading to the downing of a Hercules on 1 June. In view of the airport&#x27;s lack of impact on the ultimate outcome of the campaign, the British targeting of Stanley airport was questionable.

Planning for the raid called for a bomb run in a 35° cut across the runway, with the aim of placing at least one bomb on the runway and possibly two. The main purpose in doing so was to prevent the use of the runway by fast jets; in this respect the raid was successful as the repair to the runway was botched and subsequently there were several near accidents. The fact that the British forces could penetrate Argentine air defences and attack the airfield had the desired effect in relation to preventing fast jet usage of the Port Stanley airstrip as the Argentine military command could not risk stationing its fast jets and the infrastructure necessary to operate them on the islands if they could be destroyed on the ground, irrespective of the operational status of the runway. Admiral Woodward considered it vital to keep fast jets from using Port Stanley, to reduce the threat of air attack on the British aircraft carriers. Starting on 1 May, the Royal Navy attacked Port Stanley with aerial bombing by Sea Harriers and naval bombardment, in order to hamper Argentinian repair efforts. The Argentinians left the runway covered with piles of earth during the day, leading to claims this caused British intelligence to surmise that repairs were still in progress and misleading the British as to the condition of the airfield and the success of their raids.

Commander Nigel (Sharkey) Ward, the commander of 801 NAS, who flew a Sea Harrier to protect Black Buck One from fighter attack, was highly critical of Operation Black Buck. He calculated that for the quantity of fuel expended by Black Buck One to drop 21 bombs, which he estimated at at a cost of £3.3 million, the Sea Harriers of the carrier force could have carried out 785 sorties that would have delivered 2,357 bombs. Ward dismissed as RAF propaganda the claim that the raids led to fear of attacks on the mainland:

There is no evidence that Mirage IIIs were withdrawn from southern Argentina to protect Buenos Aires. On 29 April, Argentine radars at Puerto San Julián detected a suspected British air strike and aircraft from there were moved to Comodoro Rivadavia, but they still remained in southern Argentina.

The British intended to convince the Argentinian forces that an amphibious assault on Port Stanley was imminent, and Admiral Woodward saw Black Buck One as an important contribution to this effort, alongside naval attacks and deception efforts. The author of &quot;Vulcan 607&quot;, Rowland White, claimed that Vice Admiral Juan Lombardo was led to believe that Black Buck One was the prelude to a full-scale landing by the British. As a consequence, he ordered Rear Admiral , the commander of the Argentine Sea Fleet, to immediately attack the British fleet. This attack took the form of a pincer movement, with the light cruiser to the south and aircraft carrier to the north. On 2 May, &quot;General Belgrano&quot; was sunk by the submarine . Thereafter the Argentine Navy withdrew to territorial waters and played no further part in the conflict.

A United States Marine Corps study concluded that:

<text>USS &quot;Tirante&quot; (SS-420), a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the tirante, a silvery, elongated &quot;cutlass fish&quot; found in waters off Cuba. Her keel was laid down on 28 April 1944 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard of Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 9 August 1944 sponsored by Mrs. Ruth Maynard Sieglaff, wife of Commander William B. Sieglaff (prospective commander of PCU Tench), and commissioned on 6 November 1944 with Lieutenant Commander George L. Street III in command.

==First war patrol==
Following shakedown training in Long Island Sound, and the waters off Panama and Oahu, &quot;Tirante&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for Japan on 3 March 1945. The submarine patrolled the approaches to Nagasaki. There she sank the 703-ton tanker &quot;Fuji Maru&quot; on 25 March and followed with the sinking of the 1218-ton freighter &quot;Nase Maru&quot; three days later. After the latter attack, Japanese escorts kept &quot;Tirante&quot; down for seven hours, before she slipped away unscathed.

On 31 March, &quot;Tirante&quot; shelled and sank a 70-ton lugger with five-inch (127 mm) and 40-millimeter gunfire and, on 1 April, missed an LST-type vessel with a spread of three torpedoes. The submarine soon shifted to waters off the south coast of Korea, near the Strait of Tsushima. At twilight on 6 April, she battle-surfaced and captured a small Japanese fishing vessel and took its three crewmen prisoner before sinking it.

The following day, &quot;Tirante&quot; torpedoed a 2800-ton cargo freighter loaded with a deck cargo of oil drums. The submarine surfaced and directed a nearby Korean fishing craft to pick up two survivors. Although observers on the submarine reported witnessing the Maru&#x27;s sinking, post-war examination of Japanese records failed to confirm it.
US naval intelligence had broken the Japanese codes and was able to anticipate their movements. One intercepted message told of an important convoy steaming toward the &quot;Tirante&quot;&#x27;s area. In response to this information, the submarine laid an ambush on 9 April. Picking out two targets, she launched three torpedoes at each. One spread missed, but the other struck the 5,058-ton troopship &quot;Nikkō Maru&quot;, carrying homeward-bound Japanese soldiers and sailors from Shanghai. As &quot;Nikko Maru&quot; sank, enemy escorts went on the offensive. To ward off the counterattack, &quot;Tirante&quot; fired a &quot;cutie&quot; (homing torpedo) at one of the escorts. &quot;Tirante&quot; heard an explosion, &quot;breaking-up noises&quot;, and even screams. Again, post-war accounting failed to confirm the sinking.

&quot;Tirante&quot; resumed her patrol of the Yellow Sea between Quelpart Island (Cheju Do) and the mouth of the Yangtze River. She soon received an intelligence report informing her that an important Japanese transport was at Cheju, the main port on Quelpart Island. Under cover of darkness, &quot;Tirante&quot; approach her on the surface. In spite of possible enemy radar or patrolling planes or ships, she closed the coast and penetrated the mine- and shoal-obstructed waters within the ten-fathom curve line. &quot;Tirante&quot; then entered the harbor where she found three targets: two escort vessels and the 4000-ton &quot;Juzan Maru&quot;.

The submarine launched three torpedoes at the Maru. The explosion illuminated &quot;Tirante&quot; and alerted the &quot;Mikura&quot;-class escort vessel &quot;Nomi&quot; and Type C escort ship &quot;CD-31&quot; which immediately got underway toward the submersible. As she headed back out to sea at flank speed, &quot;Tirante&quot; launched a spread of torpedoes that hit and destroyed both pursuers. En route to Midway Island, she captured two Japanese airmen (bringing her prisoner total to five) and concluded her first war patrol on 26 April.

&quot;Tirante&quot;&#x27;s performance earned Commander Street the Medal of Honor. Lieutenant Edward L. Beach, the executive officer—and later commander of during the submarine&#x27;s submerged circumnavigation of the globe—received the Navy Cross. The ship, was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.

==Second and third war patrols==
&quot;Tirante&quot; departed from Midway Island on 20 May as command ship of the nine-boat &quot;wolfpack&quot; dubbed &quot;Street&#x27;s Sweepers&quot;. They patrolled the Yellow Sea and East China Sea on the lookout for enemy targets—by then dwindling in number. &quot;Tirante&quot; located a four-ship convoy on 11 June, in the familiar waters off Nagasaki. She evaded the three escorts long enough to get a shot at an 800-ton cargo freighter and pressed home a successful attack. Post-war Japanese records, though, did not confirm the hit.

The next day, &quot;Tirante&quot; pulled off a repeat performance of her hit-and-run raid at Cheju. She crept into Ha Shima harbor, some seven miles (11 km) from Nagasaki and picked out the 2200-ton &quot;Hakuju Maru&quot; moored alongside a colliery. From a range of , the submarine fired at the cargoman which exploded. The second &quot;fish&quot; failed to detonate, but the third completed the destruction. As shells from shore guns fell, &quot;Tirante&quot; bent on speed and cleared the area.

Resuming her patrols, &quot;Tirante&quot; and her sisters played havoc with shipping between Korea and Japan, destroying junks carrying supplies from Korea to the Japanese home islands. Boarding parties from the submarine would take off the captains for questioning, put the crew in life boats, and set fire to the craft. &quot;Tirante&quot; captured a dozen in this manner and destroyed two heavily armed picket boats with surface gunfire before returning to Guam on 19 July.

&quot;Tirante&quot; departed Guam on 12 August on what would have been her third war patrol. The end of the war, however, ended the operation and the submarine put into Midway Island on 23 August. Eventually sailing for the east coast of the United States, &quot;Tirante&quot; moored at the Washington Navy Yard in October, at which time Commander Street received his Medal of Honor in a White House ceremony. Shifting to Staten Island, New York, on 31 October, the submarine remained there until moving to New London, Connecticut, on 8 January 1946. After conducting training operations out of New London, Connecticut, &quot;Tirante&quot; was decommissioned and placed in reserve on 6 July 1946 at her home port.

==Post World War II and fate==

Subsequently converted to greater underwater propulsive power (GUPPY IIA) configuration, &quot;Tirante&quot; was recommissioned on 26 November 1952, at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. After conducting her shakedown to Bermuda and operating in the Atlantic as far north as Iceland, the submarine returned to the east coast of the United States to prepare for her first deployment with the Sixth Fleet.

In the ensuing two decades, &quot;Tirante&quot; conducted six more Mediterranean Sea deployments, interspersed with a regular schedule of exercises and maneuvers with Fleet units in the North Atlantic, off the east coast and in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. The ship participated in joint exercises with NATO forces; sometimes served as a target for antisubmarine warfare exercises; and, on occasion, assisted the Fleet Sonar School at Key West, Florida, in the development of ASW tactics and weapons.

Decommissioned at Key West, Florida, on 1 October 1973, and struck from the Naval Vessel Register the same day, &quot;Tirante&quot; was sold on 11 April 1974 to Union Minerals and Alloys Corporation of New York, for scrapping.

&quot;Tirante&quot; received two battle stars and a Presidential Unit Citation for her World War II service.

The &quot;Tirante&quot; is the subject of an episode of the syndicated television anthology series, &quot;The Silent Service&quot;, which aired during the 1957-1958 season.

<text>Jasper is a specialized municipality and townsite in western Alberta within the Canadian Rockies. The townsite is in the Athabasca River valley and is the commercial centre of Jasper National Park.

== History ==

Established in 1813, Jasper House was first a fur trade outpost of the North West Company, and later Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, on the York Factory Express trade route to what was then called &quot;New Caledonia&quot; (now British Columbia) and Fort Vancouver on the lower Columbia River. Jasper House was 35 km north of today&#x27;s town of Jasper.

Jasper Forest Park was established in 1907. The railway divisional point at the location of the future townsite was established by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway in 1911 and originally named Fitzhugh after a Grand Trunk vice president (along the Grand Trunk&#x27;s &quot;alphabet&quot; line). The Canadian Northern Railway began service to its &quot;Jasper Park&quot; station in 1912, about 700 m from GTP&#x27;s Fitzhugh station. The townsite was surveyed in 1913 by H. Matheson. It was renamed Jasper after the former fur trade post. An internment camp was set up at Dominion Park in Jasper from February 1916 to August 1916.

Jasper Forest Park was renamed Jasper National Park in 1930. By 1931, Jasper was accessible by road from Edmonton. In 1940, the scenic Icefields Parkway opened, connecting Jasper to Lake Louise and Banff in Banff National Park.

The first step towards incorporation of Jasper occurred on August 31, 1995, when the &quot;Jasper Improvement District&quot; was formed from a portion of Improvement District No. 12 (Jasper National Park). The improvement district was subsequently incorporated as a specialized municipality under the name of the &quot;Municipality of Jasper&quot; on July 20, 2001. The incorporation order established the Jasper townsite as the Town of Jasper and the surrounding balance of the specialized municipality as a rural service area that was deemed equivalent to a municipal district.

The Jasper wildfire began on July 22, 2024 and destroyed significant parts of the town.

== Geography ==

The Municipality of Jasper is in the western portion of the province of Alberta within Jasper National Park. It borders the province of British Columbia to the west and Improvement District No. 12 to the north, east, and south. The Athabasca River, which originates from the Columbia Icefield, meanders northward through the municipality. The Miette River, Maligne River, and Snaring River all discharge into the Athabasca River within the Municipality of Jasper&#x27;s limits.

The Jasper townsite, which is approximately west of Edmonton, north of Banff, and east of the Yellowhead Pass, is at the intersection of Highway 16 (Yellowhead Highway) and Highway 93 (Icefields Parkway). It is near the confluence of the Athabasca River and Miette River. It lies between the Victoria Cross Ranges (northwest), Pyramid Mountain (north), Maligne Range (southeast) and Trident Ridge (southwest). Lakes near the Jasper townsite include Pyramid Lake, Patricia Lake, Lake Annette, Lake Edith, Lac Beauvert, Maligne Lake, and Medicine Lake.

<text>Philip E. Eaton (June 2, 1936 – July 21, 2023) was an American chemist. He served as Professor Emeritus of Chemistry at the University of Chicago. Eaton and his fellow researchers were the first to synthesize the &quot;impossible&quot; cubane molecule in 1964.

Working with Mao-Xi Zhang he is reported as having been the first to make octanitrocubane (their paper was published in the year 2003). Because of its eight nitro groups and highly strained C-C bonds, octanitrocubane is a very powerful high explosive.

==Early life and education==
Philip E. Eaton was born on June 2, 1936 in Brooklyn, New York. When Eaton was seven his family relocated to Budd Lake, New Jersey. Here he began attending Roxbury Grammar School and later Roxbury High School. It was during these high school years that he began to find his passion for science. It was the support of his parents and teachers that he decided to study chemistry.

Eaton attended Princeton University seeking a major in chemistry. Eaton received his B.A. in 1957 before attending Harvard University and earning his M.A. in 1960 and Ph.D. in 1961. During his time in school he became familiar with cage chemistry, specifically Kepone.

==Teaching experience==
Upon graduating from Harvard Eaton accepted an assistant professorship position at the University of California, Berkeley. During this time he taught introductory organic chemistry. In 1962, he transferred to the University of Chicago where he remained as Professor Emeritus until his death in 2023.

==Research==
After arriving at University of Chicago Eaton began his research which he is now most well known for, cubane synthesis. In 1964 Eaton and Thomas W. Cole Jr. synthesized the &quot;impossible&quot; cubane molecule. It was given this name because of its unusual cubic geometry. Many scientists believed that the 90 degree bond-angles would be too strained to allow this molecule to form. He later studied larger prismanes.

==Death==
Philip Eaton died on July 21, 2023, at the age of 87.

<text>Peter John Duncan (born 10 July 1965) is a Scottish Conservative Party politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale from 2001 to 2005.

==Early life==
Born in Ayrshire, Duncan attended Ardrossan Academy in Ardrossan, North Ayrshire and was educated at the University of Birmingham where he obtained a BCom in 1985. He later worked as a business and communications consultant for Mackays Stores Ltd from 1985 to 1988 in addition to running the family textile business John Duncan &amp; Son from 1988 to 2000. In September 1997, he appeared as a member of the audience during a Scottish Television debate about the devolution referendum, and spoke opposing the establishment of a Scottish Parliament. Duncan later stood for election to the very parliament he initially opposed.

==Parliamentary career==
He was elected to the House of Commons at the 2001 general election, taking the Galloway and Upper Nithsdale seat from the Scottish National Party. This made him the sole Conservative MP for the whole of Scotland and the first Conservative MP from Scotland since 1997. In November 2003 he was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland by new party leader, Michael Howard and he was later named as Chairman of the Scottish Conservative Party.

His constituency was abolished for the 2005 general election and replaced by Dumfries and Galloway. However he failed to win the seat, losing to Labour&#x27;s Russell Brown.

In the 2007 local elections, the first to take place under the Single Transferable Vote system, he was one of several new Conservative councillors elected to Dumfries and Galloway council.

He stood as the Conservative candidate for the Dumfries and Galloway seat at the 2010 general election. He was defeated by the incumbent Russell Brown again, with a -3.7% swing against. The following year he stood as the Conservative candidate for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at the Scottish Parliament election, where he came in fourth place.

==Personal life==
He married Lorna Anne and they have a son and daughter and, as of 2007, now lives in Dalbeattie in Dumfries and Galloway.

<doc id="417678" wikidata="Q574785" url="?curid=417678" title="G-suit">
<text>A g-suit, or anti-&quot;g&quot; suit, is a flight suit worn by aviators and astronauts who are subject to high levels of acceleration force (g). It is designed to prevent a black-out and g-LOC (g-induced loss of consciousness) caused by the blood pooling in the lower part of the body when under acceleration, thus depriving the brain of blood. Black-out and g-LOC have caused a number of fatal aircraft accidents.

== Operation ==
If blood is allowed to pool in the lower areas of the body, the brain will be deprived of blood. This lack of blood flow to the brain first causes a greyout (a dimming of the vision also called brownout), followed by tunnel vision and ultimately complete loss of vision &#x27;blackout&#x27; followed by g-induced Loss Of Consciousness or &#x27;g-LOC&#x27;. The danger of g-LOC to aircraft pilots is magnified because on relaxation of g-force there is a period of disorientation before full sensation is re-gained.
A g-suit does not so much increase the g-threshold, but makes it possible to sustain high g longer without excessive physical fatigue. The resting g-tolerance of a typical person is anywhere from 3–5 g depending on the person. A g-suit will typically add 1 g of tolerance to that limit. Pilots still need to practice the &#x27;g-straining maneuver&#x27; that consists of tensing the abdominal muscles in order to tighten blood vessels so as to reduce blood pooling in the lower body. High g is not comfortable, even with a g-suit. In older fighter aircraft, 6 g was considered a high level, but with modern fighters 9 g or more can be sustained structurally making the pilot the critical factor in maintaining high maneuverability in close aerial combat.

== Design ==
A g-suit is a special garment and generally takes the form of tightly fitting trousers, which fit either under or over (depending on the design) the flight suit worn by the aviator or astronaut. The trousers are fitted with inflatable bladders which, when pressurized through a g-sensitive valve in the aircraft or spacecraft, press firmly on the abdomen and legs, thus restricting the draining of blood away from the brain during periods of high acceleration. In addition, in some modern very high-g aircraft, the Anti-g suit effect is augmented by a small amount of pressure applied to the lungs (positive pressure breathing), which also enhances resistance to high G. The effects of anti-g suits and positive pressure breathing are straightforward to replicate in a simulator, although only continuous g can be produced artificially in devices such as centrifuges.

Various designs of g-suit have been developed. They first used water-filled bladders around the lower body and legs. Later designs used air under pressure to inflate the bladders. These g-suits were lighter than the liquid-filled versions and are still in extensive use. However, the Swiss company Life Support Systems AG and the German Autoflug collaborated to design the new Libelle suit for use with the Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft, which reverts to liquid as the medium and improves on performance. The Libelle suit is under consideration for adoption by the United States Air Force.

== History ==
As early as 1917, there were documented cases of pilots&#x27; loss of consciousness due to g (G-LOC) that were referred to as &quot;fainting in the air&quot;.

The recognition that the tight turns required of RAF High Speed Flight pilots taking part in 1920s Schneider Trophy races causing blackouts meant a restriction to 4G to limit them to &quot;grey out&quot; with only partial loss of vision.

In 1931 a professor of physiology, Frank Cotton, from the University of Sydney described a new way of determining the center of gravity of the human body. This made it possible to describe the displacement of mass within the body under acceleration. Cotton had recognised the need for an anti-gravity suit during the 1940 Battle of Britain. It was estimated that 30% of pilot deaths were due to accidents, including black-out. Supermarine Spitfires, in particular, were capable of rapid turns that generated high g-forces, causing black-out when diving to fire or avoid enemy fire.

With the development of higher speed monoplane fighters in the late 1930s, acceleration forces during combat became more severe. As early as 1940 some aircraft had foot-rests above the rudder pedals so that the pilot&#x27;s feet and legs could be raised during combat in an attempt to minimize the negative effects of high speed turns. Large rudder deflections were often not necessary during such manoeuvres, but being able to cut inside the opponent&#x27;s turning radius was.

===Franks G-Suit ===
Wilbur R. Franks had suggested water-filled system in 1938 and in the absence of government funding he built a prototype - sized on himself - with private funding but his work was limited by availability of a suitable aircraft. In 1940 the UK provided a Supermarine Spitfire to aid his research. The first g-suits were developed by a team led by Franks at the University of Toronto&#x27;s Banting and Best Medical Institute in 1941. The suits were manufactured by the Dunlop company and first used operationally in 1942 by pilots of 807 Squadron Fleet Air Arm (FAA) flying Supermarine Seafires during the Operation Torch invasion of North Africa. These devices used water-filled bladders around the legs; two Marks (versions) were developed:
* Franks Mark I suits were used by RAF Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire pilots;
* Franks Mark II suits were used by the United States Army Air Forces and Royal Canadian Air Force pilots.
Adoption of the suit by the RAF was limited, as there was concern about pilots exceeding the stress limits of their aircraft and the possibility of revealing its existence to the enemy.

=== Cotton Aerodynamic Anti-G Flying Suit ===
Professor Frank Cotton of Sydney University, Australia, designed the first successful gas-operated anti-G suit. Research commenced late in 1940, and a suit was designed with rubber sacs covered externally by inextensible material. The sacs automatically inflated when G forces increased during flying. The suit was developed at the Sydney Medical School. Cotton constructed the first human centrifuge in the Anderson Stuart Building at Sydney University under tight wartime security. The volunteers, young airmen, were strapped by their legs to the centrifuge and subjected to high g-force and monitored until black-out occurred. All lost consciousness. On February 19, 1942, the day of the major Japanese bombing of Darwin, Cotton&#x27;s suit was approved by the Allied war chiefs. The Americans soon issued orders for manufacture of a suit based on Cotton&#x27;s design. The Cotton suit was later flight-tested in a Hurricane, Kittyhawks, and Spitfires and provided about 2G protection. It was examined by RAF Physiological Laboratory and the Royal Air Force ran competitive trials of the Cotton Anti-G suit with the Frank G-Suit that was already adopted in 1944. The Franks suit was self-contained, production contracts prepared and there was insufficient capacity to develop both simultaneously so the RAF was not able to take it on but recommended the RAAF did. The Royal Air Force concluded that: &quot;There is no doubt the Cotton Suit gives the best protection.&quot; The Cotton suit&#x27;s use of gas-inflatable bladders is still used in the modern anti-G suit.

=== &#x27;Berger&#x27; Gradient Pressure Suit ===
In the United States, physiologists Drs. Earl H. Wood, Edward Baldes, Charles Code and Edward H. Lambert, working in a top-secret research lab at the Mayo Clinic, helped to define the specific physiologic effects causing blackout and unconsciousness during high G forces. Based upon their new understanding of the physiologic effects of high G-forces, they developed a more practical G-suit derived from the work of Cotton and Franks. This suit used inflation like the Cotton suit. While Professor Cotton&#x27;s design was intriguing, he was more focused on the center of gravity than on blood flow. This latter point was the key to making a practical anti-g suit that could be worn in combat.
This suit was worn by US pilots towards the end of World War II.

The researchers were part of a team assembled at the Mayo Clinic investigating the effects of high-performance flight on military pilots, by studying the physiological effects of flight and how to mitigate them. They used a large centrifuge to whirl riders and observe their blood pressures at the head and heart levels with special instruments. To prevent drops in blood pressure, the team designed an air bladder suit that inflated the pilot&#x27;s calves, thighs, and abdomen. A primary contribution, allowing for the shift from pulsatile water-filled bladders to non-pulsatile air-filled bladders, made by the Mayo investigators was to show that maintenance of arterial pressure rather than venous return was required to maintain perfusion of the eyes and brain. Prototypes of the GPS suits were known as the &quot;arterial Occlusion Suit&quot; (AOS) or the Clark-Wood suit, named after Wood and Dave Clark (head of the Dave Clark company who fabricated the early suits for the team at Mayo)

Their efforts finally culminated with the release of the first US military design in late 1943: the GPS (Gradient Pressure Suit) type fighter pilot&#x27;s G-1 anti-g-suit. The team subsequently worked on developing further, more advanced models in 1944 and beyond.

Although uncomfortable and distracting to use, later research showed that military fighter pilots who wore g-suits survived and defeated their opponents in greater numbers than those who didn&#x27;t.

Modern g-Suits meet the United States Air Force Standard CSU-13B/P and United States Navy Standard CSU 15 A/P.

==Uses==
=== Prone pilot position aircraft ===
During World War II the German Henschel Hs 132 (never flew) and the US Northrop XP-79 (crashed on first powered flight) jets both had prone positions to minimize blood pooling in the legs. After 1945 the British experimented with prone flying positions in a highly modified Gloster Meteor F8 jet fighter and the Reid and Sigrist R.S.3 &quot;Bobsleigh&quot; a piston engined trainer. However, other difficulties associated with prone piloting and the development of practical g-suits for normal seating positions terminated these experiments.

A similar concept, the supine cockpit exists.

=== Military aviation and space ===

Air-based g-suits were very common in NATO aircraft of all nations from the 1950s onwards and are still in common use today.

Later jets such as the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet, Eurofighter Typhoon and the Dassault Rafale can sustain high g loads for longer periods, and are therefore more physically demanding. By using a modern g-suit in combination with anti-g strain techniques, a trained pilot is now expected to endure accelerations of up to nine g without blacking out.

Astronauts wear g-suits similar to aviators but face different challenges due to the effects of microgravity. Aviator g-suits apply uniform pressure to the lower legs to minimize the effects of high acceleration but research from the Canadian Space Agency implies there might be a benefit in having a suit for astronauts that uses a &quot;milking action&quot; to increase blood flow to the upper body.

=== Red Bull Air Race ===

Pilots in Red Bull Air Race World Championship have worn a g-suit called g-Race Suit since the 2009 season. The g-race suit is a liquid (water) filled, autonomous and aircraft independent working full-body g-protection system. It is tailor-made for each pilot and can be fine adjusted via lacings.

The g-race suit contains four so-called &quot;fluid muscles&quot; which are sealed, liquid-filled tubes. Each fluid muscle extends from the shoulder to the ankle. Two fluid muscles – each filled with approximately 1 litre of fluid for a total of around per g-race suit – are routed vertically on the front side of the g-race suit and two are routed vertically on the rear side of the g-race suit. The suit weighs on average in total, and its fabric is made out of a special mix of Twaron and Nomex. The counter pressure effect occurs instantaneously without any time delay versus an up to two second delay before reaching full system protection in standard pneumatic, inflatable g-suits. The race pilot utilizes the g-race suit interactively by muscle straining and breathing techniques to achieve an improved cardiac output and thus improved G-protection.

<text>The Church of God for All Nations is a Holiness Pentecostal body of Christians.

Samuel Doffee (February 2, 1931 – April 23, 2010), formed &quot;The Church of God for All Nations&quot; in 1981. Doffee had been previously associated with the Church of God of Prophecy and The Church of God (Jerusalem Acres), and served in various ministerial capacities in the latter body. Bishop Grady R. Kent founded The Church of God of All Nations (now &quot;Jerusalem Acres&quot;) in 1957. After settling on the name &quot;The Church of God of All Nations&quot;, Bishop Kent was persuaded by other in the Church Pattern to change the name to The Church of God at Jerusalem Acres.

After the death of Kent in 1964, the church governance gradually moved away from &quot;theocratic&quot; rule through the &quot;Chief Bishop&quot;, toward a more democratic rule through the General Assembly. Bishop Doffee continued to preach what he believed was the prophetic message of Bishop Kent, as well as &quot;theocratic&quot; church government, and was disfellowshipped by the &quot;Church of God (Jerusalem Acres)&quot;. In 1980, Doffee believed he was instructed by prophecy to reorganize the Church of God, and chartered the new church in 1981. 

The doctrines of &quot;The Church of God for All Nations&quot; are similar to its parent body, with greater emphasis on theocracy and prophecy. Individuals must experience salvation, justification, sanctification, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is marked by the evidence of speaking in tongues. Divine healing, miracles, and deliverance from evil spirits are considered present-day ministries. Officers in the church are apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor, and teacher. This group believes very explicitly that the &quot;Great Apostasy&quot; began in AD 325 with the Council of Nicaea and continued until June 13, 1903, when Bishop Ambrose Jessup Tomlinson restored the Church, and that in the interim there was no actual theocratic governmental formed (as Jesus formed it) Church of God upon the earth, but that born-again people were abundant and continued to be &quot;saved&quot; or &quot;born again&quot; according to the Bible.

&quot;The Midnight Cry Messenger&quot; is the official church publication. Headquarters of the church are in Cleveland, Tennessee. Samuel Doffee served as Chief Bishop until his death on April 23, 2010. This body has one church in the United States and about five churches in Kenya, Africa. The Bishop of Africa is Justus Masika Khisa, and the African offices are being built in Bungoma, Kenya.
The Church of God For All Nations became defunct at the death of Bishop Sam Doffee and then restored by Chief Apostle Phil Spears in a merger with The Church of God of which Homer Tomlinson was General Overseer.

<text>Melissa Ellen Gilbert (born May 8, 1964) is an American actress. Gilbert began her career as a child actress in the late 1960s, appearing in numerous commercials and guest-starring roles on television. From 1974 to 1983, she starred as Laura Ingalls Wilder, the second-oldest daughter of Charles Ingalls (played by Michael Landon) on the NBC series &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;. During the run of &quot;Little House&quot;, Gilbert appeared in several television films, including &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; (1980), and &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; (1979). As an adult, she continued her career mainly in television films. From 2009 to 2010, Gilbert appeared as Caroline &quot;Ma&quot; Ingalls in the touring production of &quot;Little House on the Prairie, the Musical&quot;. In 2012, she was a contestant on season fourteen of the reality dance competition show &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; on ABC.

Gilbert served as president of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) from 2001 to 2005. She briefly ran for the U.S. Congress in 2016, but withdrew her candidacy before the election. She is the author of several memoirs, a children&#x27;s book, and a cookbook.

==Early life and family==
Gilbert was born in Los Angeles, California, on May 8, 1964, to a newly engaged couple, Kathy Wood and David Darlington, and placed for adoption immediately after birth. She was adopted the next day by actor and comedian Paul Gilbert and his wife, dancer and actress Barbara Crane, the daughter of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; creator Harry Crane. The Gilberts later adopted a son, Jonathan, who co-starred on &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;.

Gilbert&#x27;s parents divorced when she was 6 years old. Her mother then married attorney Harold Abeles, and together they had biological daughter Sara Rebecca Abeles (the actress known professionally as Sara Gilbert) on January 29, 1975. 

On February 13, 1976, Paul Gilbert died. Although 11-year-old Melissa was told that he had suffered a stroke, she found out years later that he had been a VA patient who dealt with chronic pain, and that he had taken his own life. The marriage of Barbara and Harold Abeles later ended in divorce. According to her biography, Gilbert was raised in her adoptive mother&#x27;s Jewish religion, but did not have any formal religious education or conversion ceremony.

==Career==

===&quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;===

Gilbert&#x27;s earliest television appearances were in dozens of commercials, including one for Alpo dog food with Lorne Greene (Michael Landon&#x27;s television father on &quot;Bonanza&quot;). She also attended school with Landon&#x27;s daughter, Leslie Landon. It was Leslie who informed her that she had won the role of Laura Ingalls Wilder, the second oldest daughter, on &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, beating out over 500 child actresses for the part. The pilot was shot in 1973 and was a ratings success. Almost a year later, Gilbert began filming the series. Gilbert became extremely close to the Landon family after her adoptive father died. However, a rift developed between Michael Landon and Gilbert after the revelation of Landon&#x27;s affair with &quot;Little House&quot; young makeup artist, Cindy Clerico.

Gilbert had limited contact with Landon after &quot;Little House&quot; ended during the 1983–84 season. Seven years later, she was contacted by Landon&#x27;s family and upon news of his condition, paid him a heartfelt visit following his May 9, 1991, appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; where he discussed his pancreatic cancer. She visited Landon at his Malibu home where he was, by then, bedridden, and they spent the afternoon together. Landon died one week later. When Gilbert gave birth to her son with second husband Bruce Boxleitner on October 6, 1995, they named him Michael, in honor of Landon. During the show&#x27;s run, Gilbert appeared in several television films, including &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; and &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot;.

===Career after &quot;Little House&quot;===
Gilbert has continued to work regularly, mainly in television. She starred as Jean Donovan in the biopic &quot;Choices of the Heart&quot; (1983), and as Anna Sheridan in three episodes of &quot;Babylon 5&quot; with then-husband Boxleitner in 1996. She also provided the voice of Batgirl on the 1990s &quot;&quot;, though she would be replaced by voice actress Tara Strong for the series&#x27; follow-up &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;.

For her contribution to the television industry, Gilbert received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6429 Hollywood Blvd in 1985. Her then-fiancé, Rob Lowe, was present with her when her star was unveiled during the ceremony.

In 1998, she was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In 2006, Gilbert appeared as Shari Noble, a patient looking to reconstruct her nipples after committing zoophilia with her dog in a season four episode of &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;.

In 2008 and through 2009, Gilbert played Caroline &quot;Ma&quot; Ingalls in the musical adaptation of &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;. This world premiere production at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis was directed by Francesca Zambello and also starred Kara Lindsay as Laura. The show ran through October 19 and was on a US National tour for 2009–10. The tour ended in June 2010 at Starlight Theatre in Kansas City, Missouri.

In March and April 2018, Gilbert starred in an Off-Off-Broadway, limited-run production of Geraldine Aron&#x27;s 2001 one-woman play 2001 &quot;My Brilliant Divorce&quot;.

===&quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;===

In March 2012, Gilbert joined the cast of celebrity contestants on season 14 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. She was paired with Maksim Chmerkovskiy. During week four&#x27;s show, while dancing the Paso Doble, she fell and hit her head on Maksim&#x27;s leg and suffered a mild concussion and was taken to a hospital. She went home to recuperate, but returned to continue in the competition. In week eight of competition, she was eliminated, finishing in fifth place.

===Screen Actors Guild presidency (2001–2005)===
Gilbert was elected president of the Screen Actors Guild in 2001 after a contentious candidacy, in which she ultimately beat her opponent, &quot;Rhoda&quot; actress Valerie Harper. In 2003, she was re-elected, defeating Kent McCord with 50% of the vote to his 42%. In July 2005, she announced that she would not seek a third term.

===2016 congressional campaign===
On August 10, 2015, Gilbert announced her campaign for Michigan&#x27;s 8th congressional district in the 2016 elections to the United States House of Representatives. Gilbert, who was the presumptive Democratic nominee in the district, dropped out of the race in May 2016, citing health issues.

In 2022, Gilbert launched a lifestyle app aimed at women called Modern Prairie.

==Personal life==

===Relationships===
Gilbert was married to actor Bo Brinkman from 1988-1994, and to actor Bruce Boxleitner from 1995-2011.

In January 2013, Gilbert&#x27;s representative confirmed her engagement to actor Timothy Busfield. They married on April 24, 2013, lived in Howell, Michigan, from 2013 to 2018, and moved to New York City late in 2018. Also in 2018, the couple purchased a cottage in the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York; they said they were renovating it and intended to make it their permanent home. 

===Tax issues===
Following her announcement as a candidate for U.S. Representative from Michigan, a spokesperson for her opponent&#x27;s campaign referred to Gilbert as a &quot;tax cheat&quot;. Gilbert owed $360,000 in back federal taxes and $112,000 in California state taxes. Gilbert responded by stating that this is not true, that the tax debt was an outgrowth of a stalled acting career, the economy, and divorce. She also stated that she had negotiated a repayment plan with the IRS.

===Health issues===
In her late thirties, Gilbert battled addiction to prescription medication and alcohol. 

While playing the role of Caroline &quot;Ma&quot; Ingalls in the touring musical &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, a visit to the doctor revealed that Gilbert had been working with a broken back for months. On July 22, 2010, Gilbert underwent surgery to replace a disc as well as fuse a vertebra in her lower spine. The surgery was described as a complete success.

In January 2015, Gilbert decided to have her breast implants removed for health reasons.

Gilbert has misophonia.

<doc id="417693" wikidata="Q3648309" url="?curid=417693" title="Come Undone (Duran Duran song)">
<text>&quot;Come Undone&quot; is a song by English rock band Duran Duran, released in March 1993 by Parlophone as the second single from their seventh studio album, &quot;Duran Duran&quot; (1993). With their commercial and critical success reestablished by the previous single &quot;Ordinary World&quot;, &quot;Come Undone&quot; continued to showcase more of the band&#x27;s entry into the adult contemporary radio format.

The single became the group&#x27;s second consecutive US top-10 hit from the &quot;Wedding Album&quot;, peaking at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and becoming their last top-40 hit on that chart. It was also popular in the United Kingdom and other international markets, reaching number two in Canada, number eight in Italy, number nine in Ireland, and number 13 in the UK. As of October 2021, &quot;Come Undone&quot; is the eighth-most streamed Duran Duran song in the UK. The accompanying music video was directed by Julien Temple.

==Background==
&quot;Come Undone&quot; stands out as the sole track on the album to which John Taylor didn&#x27;t contribute. Despite being the second single released from &quot;Duran Duran&quot;, the song was actually the final one recorded after the album was already completed in early 1992. At that stage, Taylor had completed his parts for all the other songs and had left for Los Angeles to spend time with his wife. In an interview with BBC, Taylor remarked, &quot;Maybe I wished I&#x27;d played on &#x27;Come Undone&#x27;. I&#x27;d gone back to Los Angeles. We&#x27;d put that album to bed. I&#x27;m not coming back for one more song. Maybe it would have been a different song if I&#x27;d been there, maybe it wouldn&#x27;t have been such a great song. But I&#x27;m not one for regrets.&quot; Subsequently, co-producer John Jones stepped in to handle the bass for the song. Due to the timing of events, &quot;Come Undone&quot; almost didn&#x27;t make it onto the album. Warren Cuccurullo revealed to author Steve Malins that he and Nick Rhodes had originally planned on using the song for a project outside of Duran Duran with Gavin Rossdale, but had changed plans when singer Simon Le Bon took a liking to the music and began to come up with lyrics on the spot.

==Recording history==
&quot;Come Undone&quot; was initially built off of a single guitar hook, which the group&#x27;s guitarist at the time, Warren Cuccurullo, developed in Privacy Studios while trying to do a re-interpretation of the song &quot;First Impression&quot; from their 1990 album &quot;Liberty&quot;. John Jones and Cuccurullo expanded on this idea, incorporating a drum loop and bass from Jones&#x27; track &quot;Face to Face&quot;. Although the drum loop was often mistaken for a sample of Ashley&#x27;s Roachclip, it was an original creation according to the American music journalist Annie Zaleski. Their unfinished demo caught the attention of Nick Rhodes and Simon Le Bon, which they played to them through a phone call. This led to Rhodes joining them in the studio to finalize the music that afternoon. Le Bon swiftly penned lyrics for the song and added vocals the following day. The next day they brought in the English singer Tessa Niles for backing vocals and added additional overdubs. Niles told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that Rhodes and Cuccurullo were &quot;asking me to jump through various vocal hoops and try different things on the chorus and try it in different ways. My initial idea for the female vocal was quite soft and breathy and sexy. I think at one point, Nick said, &#x27;Listen, unleash the diva. Just go for it. Bring her out and let&#x27;s see what you got.&#x27;&quot; The song was then mixed the next day, completing the creative process.

==Music video==
The music video for &quot;Come Undone&quot; was directed by British film, documentary and music video director Julien Temple and shot the music video inside of an aquarium. It features multiple, unrelated clips of people in different areas. These include a little girl seeing her parents together, an older couple who have survived a flood, a little girl hiding under the bed while placing her head on top of her white teddy bear, an alcoholic, and a man who is revealed to be a cross-dresser. Also seen in the video is the backing singer Tessa Niles, struggling underwater to break free of the chains that bind her, where she sings her backup line in the song. A portion of the music video can be seen in the &quot;No Laughing&quot; episode of the MTV show &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, which was aired in July 1993.

==B-sides, bonus tracks and remixes==
The single was released in the United Kingdom on 29 March 1993, with an acoustic version of &quot;Ordinary World&quot; as the B-side. This was the single&#x27;s official B-side in the UK, along with two official remixes of &quot;Come Undone&quot;. In the US however, three new, original compositions written during the album&#x27;s production were featured as B-sides – &quot;Time for Temptation&quot;, &quot;Stop Dead&quot; and &quot;Falling Angel&quot;. For collectors, the US releases also contained an alternate mix of &quot;To the Shore&quot; and the first appearance on CD of &quot;The Chauffeur (Blue Silver)&quot;.

<text>Annabelle Janet Ewing (born 20 August 1960) is a Scottish politician and lawyer who has served as Deputy Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament, alongside Liam McArthur, since May 2021. A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), she has been the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Cowdenbeath constituency since 2016, having previously been an MSP for the Mid Scotland and Fife region from 2011 to 2016.

Ewing previously served in the British House of Commons as a Member of Parliament for Perth, from 2001 to 2005. She was Scotland&#x27;s Minister for Youth and Women&#x27;s Employment from 2014 to 2016, and Minister for Community Safety and Legal Affairs from 2016 to 2018. Her brother, Fergus Ewing, is also an MSP in the Scottish Parliament, and their mother, Winnie Ewing, previously served as an MSP, MP and MEP.

==Background==
Ewing was born on 20 August 1960 to Winnifred Margaret Ewing (née Woodburn) and Stewart Martin Ewing. Her mother was a prominent former Scottish politician. She attended Craigholme School for Girls in Glasgow and the University of Glasgow, where she graduated with a law degree.

Before becoming an MP, Ewing was a European Community competition lawyer in Brussels and ran a small legal practice.

She lives in Perthshire. Her mother was former SNP President, Winnie Ewing, who in the past was a member of three different parliaments — Westminster, the Scottish Parliament and the European Parliament. Her brother is MSP Fergus Ewing, and her sister-in-law was the late Margaret Ewing, who had been an MSP and an MP. Her late father, Stewart Ewing was elected as an SNP district councillor for the Summerston Ward in Glasgow 1977, when he gained it from Dick Dynes, then-leader of the Labour Group on Glasgow District Council, a result described at the time by &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; as &quot;an absolute sensation&quot;.

Ewing is a member of Shelter and Amnesty International. She has been involved in a number of Parliamentary campaigns, including fighting for the rights of people with Hepatitis C, and working to gain a public enquiry into the events at Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut, where James Collinson, a constituent, died on 23 March 2002.

==Political career==
Ewing was first selected as a SNP candidate for the UK Parliament to contest a by-election for Hamilton South in 1999, the constituency where her mother had won a famous by-election victory in 1967. Labour had a comfortable majority at the 1997 election and despite a swing of 16% to the SNP in 1999, Labour&#x27;s Bill Tynan won the seat.

In 2001, Ewing stood for the UK Parliament again, this time in Perth, where Roseanna Cunningham had been the MP. Ewing was elected, defeating the Conservative candidate by just 48 votes, giving her the narrowest majority in Scotland. In the 2005 election, following a boundary revision, she contested the new constituency of Ochil and South Perthshire, losing to the Labour party candidate, Gordon Banks.

She sought to become SNP candidate for Moray in the 27 April 2006 Scottish Parliament by-election to succeed her late sister-in-law, Margaret Ewing. She was defeated by North East Scotland MSP Richard Lochhead who went on to win the seat in the by-election.

She was later selected to contest the Falkirk East seat in the 2007 election on behalf of the SNP as a replacement for the previously selected candidate, the late Douglas Henderson. On 3 May 2007 she achieved a 9% swing from Labour to the SNP in Falkirk East, however this was not enough to displace the incumbent Cathy Peattie.

She contested Ochil and South Perthshire for a second time at the 2010 election, failing again to take it from Gordon Banks, this time on an increased (4%) swing away from the SNP to Labour. At the 2011 election Ewing was elected to the Scottish Parliament as an additional member for the Mid Scotland and Fife region.

She is famed due to an incident that occurred on 16 December 2004, whereby the Deputy Speaker removed her from the House as she refused to apologise for calling the then Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon a &quot;back-stabbing coward&quot; during exchanges over Geoff Hoon&#x27;s plans to merge Scottish Regiments, including the Black Watch.

She was promoted to the Scottish Government on 21 November 2014 in Nicola Sturgeon&#x27;s first Cabinet reshuffle. She became Minister for Youth and Women&#x27;s Employment, transferring to the Community Safety and Legal Affairs portfolio in 2016. She left the government in June 2018.

After being re-elected in the 2021 election, Ewing was elected as one of the two Deputy Presiding Officers of the Scottish Parliament. On 20 April 2023, after a particularly robust intervention from Fergus Ewing on the subject of gas extraction, she had to remind him officially about treating fellow members with respect. First Minister Humza Yousaf then quipped that he suspected it was not the first time she had had to tell her brother off.

Boxleitner has appeared in many other TV shows, including an appearance in 1973 as Rick Welsh, a University of Minnesota Track Star, in the season four episode, &quot;I Gave at the Office&quot; in &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show.&quot; Other appearances include &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; including the last episode of its twenty-year run, &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; and &quot;She Spies&quot;, and in 1982, he played Chase Marshall in the TV film &quot;Bare Essence&quot;, with Genie Francis. He was a member of the cast of &quot;Heroes&quot; for seasons three and four, playing New York Governor Robert Malden in three episodes. He also appears on the television series &quot;Chuck&quot; as the father of Devon Woodcomb. He was in such made-for-television films as &quot;The Secret&quot;, &quot;Hope Ranch&quot;, &quot;Falling in Love with the Girl Next Door&quot;, &quot;Pandemic&quot;, &quot;Sharpshooter&quot; and &quot;Aces &#x27;N&#x27; Eights&quot;.

Boxleitner was a guest-star on &quot;NCIS&quot; in the fall of 2010. He played Vice Admiral C. Clifford Chase, a high-ranking Navy official. Boxleitner also lends his voice to the animated version of his iconic character Tron in the animated series &quot;&quot;. The series premiered on Disney XD on June 7, 2012. He also reprises the character Alan Bradley/Tron from the films &quot;Tron&quot; and &quot;Tron: Legacy&quot;. From 2013 to 2015, he played Bob Beldon, the owner of the local bed and breakfast, in the Hallmark Channel series &quot;Cedar Cove&quot;.

Boxleitner later recurred on &quot;Supergirl&quot; portraying Baker, the vice-president of the United States who is later sworn in as the new president after Lynda Carter&#x27;s character Olivia Marsdin is outed as a Durlan by Mercy Graves and Otis Graves. He gained the role after Brent Spiner stepped down due to a scheduling conflict related to a family matter.

From 2019, Boxleitner had a recurring role on the Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries series of films &quot;The Matchmaker Mysteries&quot;.

===Film===

He has also appeared in several films, including &quot;Tron&quot; (in which he played the title role) and &quot;The Baltimore Bullet&quot; (1980) with James Coburn. He reprised his role in the &quot;Tron&quot; sequel &quot;&quot; and in the video game &quot;&quot; which was released alongside the film &quot;Tron: Legacy&quot;, as he did for the sequel video game named &quot;Tron 2.0&quot;, and Disney/Square Enix crossover video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;. Boxleitner also voiced Col. John Konrad in video game &quot;Spec Ops: The Line&quot;. He also starred as Confederate General James Longstreet in the 2003 film &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;. He provides the voice of Colin Barrow in the animated science fiction horror film &quot;Dead Space: Downfall&quot;, based on the video game &quot;Dead Space&quot;. Other films he has performed in include &quot;Kuffs&quot;, &quot;The Babe&quot;, &quot;Brilliant&quot;, &quot;Snakehead Terror&quot;, &quot;Legion of the Dead&quot;, &quot;King of the Lost World&quot;, &quot;Shadows in Paradise&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

In July 2015, Boxleitner said that he is done with the &quot;Tron&quot; franchise, as &quot;it&#x27;s been too up and down for me. I would rather not just keep going. I don&#x27;t want to repeat my career anymore.&quot;

===Modeling===
From 1986 to 1989, Boxleitner appeared in advertisements for Estee Lauder&#x27;s &quot;Lauder For Men&quot;.

===Novels===
Boxleitner is the author of two science fiction novels with a Western setting, &quot;Frontier Earth&quot; (1999) and &quot;Searcher&quot; (2001).

===Audio books===
Boxleitner played a major role in the audio dramatization of &quot;The Great Secret&quot;, part of the &quot;Golden Age of Fiction&quot; series by L. Ron Hubbard. He also played Captain Gavin Blaire in the unabridged version of &quot;World War Z&quot;.

==Personal life==
Boxleitner&#x27;s first marriage was to American actress Kathryn Holcomb, who co-starred with him on &quot;How The West Was Won&quot; as his on-screen sister Laura. They had two sons together.

Boxleitner&#x27;s second marriage was to American actress Melissa Gilbert. They have a son born in 1995. Gilbert also guest-starred as Boxleitner&#x27;s on-screen wife, Anna Sheridan, during Season 3 of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. On March 1, 2011, Gilbert announced that she and Bruce had separated after 16 years of marriage. On August 25 of the same year, it was reported that Gilbert had filed for divorce.

In 2003, Boxleitner was appointed to the Board of Governors of the National Space Society, a nonprofit, educational space advocacy organization founded by Dr. Wernher von Braun.
He was friends with actress Beverly Garland for nearly 30 years. He met her on an episode of &quot;How The West Was Won&quot;, and later co-starred alongside her on &quot;Scarecrow &amp; Mrs. King&quot;, though he had very few scenes with her. Then, in 1986, Boxleitner presented Garland the Golden Boot Award. After the cancellation of &quot;Scarecrow&quot;, Boxleitner remained close to Garland, contacting her consistently, until her death, on December 5, 2008. He said in an interview, &quot;I used to keep up with Beverly Garland until she passed. There was actually a hotel named after her. She was such a trip. She was a great lady.&quot;

Bruce is currently married to publicist Verena King.

<text>Annfield Plain is a village in County Durham, in England. It is situated on a plateau between the towns of Stanley, to the north-east, and Consett, to the west. According to the 2001 census, Annfield Plain had a population of 3,569. By the time of the 2011 Census Annfield Plain had become a ward of Stanley parish. The ward had a population of 7,774. Along with much of the surrounding area, Annfield Plain&#x27;s history was coal mining.

Much of the surrounding landscape is rough moorland, dominated by the nearby Pontop Pike television mast. Not far from semi-rural Derwentside, however, is the Tyneside–Wearside conurbation, with Newcastle away, and Sunderland a similar distance. The cathedral city of Durham is away and offers quite a contrast to the former pit villages in the area of Annfield Plain.
==Name==
&quot;Anfield&quot;, as the name was originally appears to derive from &quot;the fields of An&quot;, referring to a man who lived before the Norman Conquest. The &quot;Plain&quot; part of the name was originally &quot;Plane&quot; and appears to refer originally not to the plateau on which the village stands but to the inclined plane on the Stanhope and Tyne Railway of 1834 (now the basis of the eastern end of the C2C cycle route passing through Annfield Plain, from neighbouring Greencroft through to Stanley). The engine used by the plane was known as the Anfield Engine because of its proximity to Anfield House, built in the 18th century on nearby Loud Hill. The spelling changed to &quot;Annfield Plain&quot; around 1856, when houses were built for miners on the nearby plateau.

==History==
The earliest hard evidence of habitation in the area comes from the 16th century, when the main economic activity was sheep farming. The village&#x27;s association with mining begins in the late 17th century when many shallow mines were dug. The Stanhope and Tyne Railway, laid in 1834, assisted the transportation of coal. Several limekilns were built at this time and were fuelled by local coal, with limestone being brought in by rail.

Demand for coal increased with the advent of the Industrial Revolution, and a number of deep pits were sunk over the course of the 19th century. The village grew substantially and light industry increased, including the construction of a brewery, mill, and candle factory; as well as various services for the population, including a school, church, at least two nonconformist chapels, and a variety of shops.

In the 19th century Annfield Plain was the scene of a murder, when a man named William Thompson killed his wife. He was hanged at Durham prison on 5 January 1874.³

Annfield Plain Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1907. The club closed in 1931.

&quot;Greencroft Comprehensive School&quot; (later &quot;Greencroft School&quot;) was the main secondary school in Annfield Plain between 1965 and 2013, split between sites at New Kyo and Greencroft (see Greencroft for more information). It was merged with &quot;Stanley School of Techlonolgy&quot; in 2011 to form North Durham Academy then closed in 2013 when pupils were moved to the new campus in Stanley.

==Present day==


&quot;Annfield Plain&quot; is centered on what used to be the junction of the former A693 between Consett and Stanley (now bypassing Annfield Plain to the south west) and the B6168, heading north towards Catchgate and Flint Hill. The A6076 additionally heads south west towards Maiden Law and Lanchester.

While there is some light industry (mostly at nearby &quot;Greencroft Industrial Park&quot;), most of Annfield Plain is made up of housing, village shops, a working man&#x27;s club and two remaining pubs (Coach and Horses, and the Queen&#x27;s Head – the Smugglers Arms closed in the 1990s and the Plainsman ceased trading and was demolished in 2009).

The local Tesco (formally Co-operative) Co-op supermarket was commonly known as the &quot;Disco&quot;, an allusion to its former name: the &quot;Annfield Plain Co-op and Discount Electricals&quot;. The supermarket was converted to a Tesco store in October 2007. The original Annfield Plain co-operative store was dismantled and rebuilt at the nearby Beamish Open Air Museum in the late 1980s. The site of the village&#x27;s main pit, the &quot;Busty&quot;, is now a privately owned coach garage.

Annfield Plain Public Library is situated on and just over the boundary with Catchgate to the north west.

The C2C cycle route passes directly through Annfield Plain to the south of Tesco on its way from Whitehaven in Cumbria on the west coast, to Sunderland on the east coast, following the route of the former Stanhope and Tyne Railway. The C2C enters Annfield Plain from the east from Oxhill and Stanley. It leaves via a footbridge over the A693 to the south into Greencroft Industrial Estate after passing &quot;Annfield Plain Park&quot; before turning west towards Greencroft proper.

Annfield Plain F.C., based at Derwent Park Stadium, is situated on the south west side of Annfield Plain, backing onto Greencroft Nature Reserve and Alexander Pond. Annfield Plain Cricket Club is located on the west side of the village within Greencroft.

Annfield Plain Park, on the south side of the village, contains tennis courts on its northern corner, a bowling green, a children&#x27;s play area, a basic basketball court, a war memorial and a green area with football pitches.

==Geography==

<doc id="417700" wikidata="Q3073326" url="?curid=417700" title="Fire and brimstone">
<text>Fire and brimstone ( &quot;gofrīt wāʾēš&quot;; ) is an idiomatic expression referring to God&#x27;s wrath found in both the Old and New Testaments. In the Bible, it often appears in reference to the fate of the unfaithful. Brimstone, an archaic term for sulfur, evokes the acrid odor of sulfur dioxide, which is stated to be given off by lightning strikes. The association of sulfur with divine retribution is common in the Bible.

The English translation &quot;fire and brimstone&quot; is found in the 1611 Christian King James Version of the Old Testament and also in the 1917 translation of the Jewish Publication Society. The 1857 Leeser translation of the Tanakh inconsistently uses both &quot;sulfur&quot; and &quot;brimstone&quot; to translate גָּפְרִ֣ית וָאֵ֑שׁ. The translation used by the 1985 New JPS is &quot;sulfurous fire&quot; while the 1978 Christian New International Version translation uses &quot;burning sulfur.&quot;

Used as an adjective, fire-and-brimstone often refers to a style of Christian preaching that uses vivid descriptions of judgment and eternal damnation to encourage repentance especially popular during historical periods of Great Awakening.

==Etymology==
According to &quot;Strong&#x27;s Concordance&quot;, the term translated as &quot;brimstone&quot;, the Hebrew &quot;gofrīt&quot;, is the adjectival form of &quot;gōfer&quot; (גֹפֶר), which is used earlier in the Hebrew Bible to denote the wood which was used to build Noah&#x27;s Ark. In this view, the term would not denote sulfur, but instead, some sort of derivative of the wood or its tree, which was presumably flammable. Strong concludes that &quot;gofrīt&quot; must therefore refer to the plant&#x27;s resin, as resin&#x27;s flammable nature was both known and widely exploited during ancient times.

The Septuagint translates the Hebrew term as &quot;theîon&quot; (θεῖον), a word which shares the root of the verb &quot;thumiáō&quot; (θυμιάω), which means &quot;to burn, to smoke&quot;. This unambiguously refers to sulfur, as Pliny the Elder writes that the substance was widely used as a fumigant, medicine, and bleaching agent. Compounding this, the Targum Jonathan translates the Hebrew &quot;gofrīt&quot; as &quot;kīvrētāʾ&quot; (Aramaic: כִּבְרֵיתָא), a term used several times in the Talmud for a substance which was used to bleach clothing.

==References in the Old Testament ==
The Old Testament uses the phrase &quot;fire and brimstone&quot; in the context of divine punishment and purification. In Genesis 19, God destroys Sodom and Gomorrah with a rain of fire and brimstone (), and in Deuteronomy 29, the Israelites are warned that the same punishment would fall upon them should they abandon their covenant with God. Elsewhere, divine judgments involving fire and sulfur are prophesied against Assyria (Isaiah 30), Edom (Isaiah 34), Gog (Ezekiel 38), and all the wicked (Psalm 11).

The breath of God, in Isaiah 30:33, is compared to brimstone: &quot;The breath of Yahweh, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.&quot;

==In Christianity==

Fire and brimstone frequently appear as agents of divine wrath throughout the Christian Book of Revelation culminating in chapters 19–21, wherein Satan and the ungodly are cast into a lake of fire burning with brimstone (, &quot;limnēn tou pyros tēs kaiomenēs en thei&quot;). The fire appears in such passages is &quot;eternal,&quot; unlike the bodies or souls of people.

==Islamic reference==
The story of prophet Lot finds mention in several Qur&#x27;anic passages, especially Chapter 26 (Ash-Shu&#x27;ara):160-175 which reads: &quot;The people of Lut rejected the apostles. Behold, their brother Lut said to them: &quot;Will ye not fear (God)? &quot;I am to you an apostle worthy of all trust. &quot;So fear God and obey me. &quot;No reward do I ask of you for it: my reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds. &quot;Of all the creatures in the world, will ye approach males, &quot;And leave those whom God has created for you to be your mates? Nay, ye are a people transgressing (all limits)!&quot; They said: &quot;If thou desist not, O Lut! thou wilt assuredly be cast out!&quot; He said: &quot;I do detest your doings.&quot; &quot;O my Lord! deliver me and my family from such things as they do!&quot; So We delivered him and his family,- all Except an old woman who lingered behind. But the rest We destroyed utterly. We rained down on them a shower (of brimstone): and evil was the shower on those who were admonished (but heeded not)! Verily in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe. And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might Most Merciful.&quot;

==History==
According to Josephus, &quot;Now this country is then so sadly burnt up, that nobody cares to come at it;... It was of old a most happy land, both for the fruits it bore and the riches of its cities, although it be now all burnt up. It is related how for the impiety of its inhabitants, it was burnt by lightning; in consequence of which there are still the remainders of that divine fire; and the traces (or shadows) of the five cities are still to be seen...&quot; (The Jewish War, book IV, end of ch. 8, in reference to Sodom.)

Puritan preacher Thomas Vincent (an eyewitness of the Great Fire of London) authored a book called &quot;Fire and Brimstone in Hell&quot;, first published in 1670. In it he quotes from Psalm 11:6 &quot;Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and a horrible tempest, this shall be the portion of their cup.&quot;

Preachers such as Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield were referred to as &quot;fire-and-brimstone preachers&quot; during the First Great Awakening of the 1730s and 1740s. Edwards&#x27; &quot;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God&quot; remains among the best-known sermons from this period. Reports of one occasion when Edwards preached it said that many of the audience burst out weeping, and others cried out in anguish or even fainted.

<text>Tres Valles () is a town and municipality in the Mexican state of Veracruz, created as a free municipality by decree on November 25, 1988. It is located in the lower reaches of the Papaloapan, and borders the state of Oaxaca and the towns of Tierra Blanca and Cosamaloapan.

The main source of income is agriculture, particularly sugar cane cultivation, but rice, corn, beans, pineapples, sorghum, and mangoes are also grown here.

== Etymology ==

The historical origin of the name Three Valleys is uncertain, but the generally accepted version is that it was named after three valleys in the region: Valle Nacional, the Valley of Tesechoacán (currently José Azueta) and Playa Vicente. The earliest known version of the &quot;Three Valleys&quot; dates from 1962.

=== History ===
===Prehispanic era===
This area of the lower Papaloapan was populated primarily by the Olmec, who disappeared for unknown reasons. Later, the area was inhabited by the Totonac, from approximately 500–100 BCE. By the time the Spanish arrived, the area had been conquered by the Mexicas, as with much of the Mesoamerican peoples.

The current municipality of Tres Valles was divided between the jurisdictions of Cosamaloapan and Puctlancingo, but the only people on record within the current limits were the Puctlancingo, located at the confluence of the Amapa and Tonto rivers. It is likely that there were other small settlements at the time of conquest. A 1584 map showed a hill with ruins called Quateupan south of the Coapilla creek, near the river Tonto.

===Colonial period===

After the fall of Tenochtitlan, Cortés sent Gonzalo de Sandoval to the conquest of the Tuxtepec garrison. Achieving his mission, he subjected the people of the Papaloapan basin to the encomienda system. Cosamaloapan joined the jurisdiction of the district of Guaspaltepec to form one corregimiento (township).

In 1600, Tuxtepec and Puctlancingo were added to the congregation of the province Guaspaltepec. That same year, Guaspaltepec was abandoned, its inhabitants were living in Mixtlan, the head priest moved to Chacaltianguis and the fate of the township was in the air. After the disappearance of Guaspaltepec the district came under the power of Cosamaloapan.

In 1786 the Spanish crown ordered the creation of the Municipality of Veracruz. The area remained a Canton until 1917. Consequently, the municipality became important for political and administrative organization.

=== Foundation ===

November 21, 1907, is considered the founding date of the city of Tres Valles. However, the exact date is unknown. The earliest record with that date in 1982, when a commemorative monument to Miguel Hidalgo was placed in the city&#x27;s central park. It seems that during the process of building the monument, the date was established. There&#x27;s also a document dated November 24, 1939, stating that the founding was &quot;32 years ago&quot;, that is, around 1907.

According to historians the settlement has existed since at least 1900, when a camp was created for builders of the Pacific Veracruz railway. The only relevant fact pointing to this period is the 1907 arrival of the Martinez family, owners of the land where the town was settled. Perhaps this and other facts have survived in the collective memory and over the passage of time, this has become the year considered the foundation of the community.

=== Mexican Revolution ===
=== Post-Revolutionary era ===

In 1921, Three Valleys had a population of 791 persons (399 men and 392 women).

In 1924, the first school was established (which now houses the School &quot;March 18&quot;) which was directed by Prof. &quot;Nacha&quot;, originally from Tierra Blanca, Veracruz. It was built by Ignacio Martinez, who also donated the land.

Also in 1924, Martinez built the first Catholic chapel, in honor of Our Lady of Guadalupe. This location is now the Municipal Agency, as the chapel was stripped during the Cristero War.

The banana boom ended with the plague the Sigatoka fungus. Soon after came the expropriation of the three banana companies, decreed by President Lázaro Cárdenas, which were merged into the &quot;Transcontinental&quot; company.

<text>Sir Timothy Alan Davan Sainsbury (born 11 June 1932) is a Conservative politician and businessman in the United Kingdom.

==Early life==
Sainsbury is the youngest son of Alan Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury, and his wife Doreen. His elder brothers are the late Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover, a former chairman of Sainsbury&#x27;s, and the late Simon Sainsbury. Lord Sainsbury of Turville, a former Labour Minister for Science, is a cousin.

His great-grandparents, John James Sainsbury and Mary Ann Staples, established a grocer&#x27;s at 173 Drury Lane in 1869, which became the British supermarket chain Sainsbury&#x27;s.

==Education==
Sainsbury was educated at Sandroyd School, Eton College, and Worcester College, Oxford.

==Business career==

Tim Sainsbury joined Sainsbury&#x27;s in 1956. In 1959 he became deputy to Fred Salisbury (the first non-Sainsbury director of the company). He was appointed Director of Estates, Architects and Engineers in 1962. In this role he was in charge of converting all the remaining counter service shops to self-service, and modernising the earlier self-service shops.

When the Company listed on the London Stock Exchange on 12 July 1973, as J Sainsbury plc, his family at the time kept control with an 85% stake. Whilst his cousin, David Sainsbury, inherited his father Robert Sainsbury&#x27;s entire 18% shareholding, Tim Sainsbury had to split his father Alan Sainsbury&#x27;s 18% stake with his brothers JD Sainsbury and Simon Sainsbury, and so they held 6% each. It is believed that Sir Robert Sainsbury gave David Sainsbury his entire shareholding (rather than split it between David and his three daughters) so that David would have more votes at the table, considering John Davan Sainsbury, who became chairman in 1969 on Sir Robert Sainsbury&#x27;s retirement, had a forceful, autocratic style of leadership, whereas David was always more cautious.

Tim Sainsbury stepped down from the board in 1983 to further pursue his career in politics. In 1992 his brother JD Sainsbury retired and was succeeded as chairman and chief executive by his cousin, David Sainsbury. Tesco overtook Sainsbury&#x27;s to become the UK&#x27;s largest supermarket chain in 1995. As a result, it is believed that JD Sainsbury asked Tim to re-join Sainsbury&#x27;s as a non-executive director in 1995 to support David.

David stepped down in 1998 to pursue a career in politics, and in 1999, Tim stepped down as non-executive director, meaning no member of the Sainsbury family now works for the Company. At the time he vowed &quot;to remain a major and committed shareholder.&quot;

On 13 January 2006, the company was notified that Sir Timothy Sainsbury no longer has a notifiable interest in the company&#x27;s issued share capital, such interest now being below 3%. His wife, who had held the other half of his 6% stake, dropped her interest in Sainsbury&#x27;s below 3% the previous week.

As of August 2009, Tim Sainsbury together with his wife were still thought to own just under 3% of the retailer. The Sainsbury family as a whole control approximately 15% of Sainsbury&#x27;s.

In the Sunday Times Rich List 2008 his family fortune was estimated at £1.3 billion.

==Political career==
Sainsbury was Conservative Member of Parliament for Hove from 1973 to 1997, and served as a junior minister, holding a number of Ministerial posts in the previous Conservative administration including those of Minister of State for Trade (1990–92) and Minister for Industry (1992–94). He was president of the Hove Conservative Association from 1998 until 2002 and was President of the Conservative Friends of Israel from 1997 until 2005. He is a Patron of the Tory Reform Group. In 2019 he announced his intention to vote Liberal Democrat at the general election.

==Charitable works==

Sainsbury and his two brothers funded an extension to the National Gallery at a cost of around £50 million, which opened in 1991 as the Sainsbury Wing.

He was Chairman of the Somerset House Trust from 1997 until 2002, and was president of a £25m campaign for Worcester College, Oxford.

He was appointed as a trustee of the Victoria and Albert Museum on 17 December 2003 and was re-appointed on 17 December 2007. Tim Sainsbury is Chairman of the V&amp;A&#x27;s International Council, which aims to secure major donations for the FuturePlan.

==Family==
He has two daughters, Camilla (born 1962) and Jessica (born 1970), and two sons, James (born 1962) and Alexander (born 1968). Camilla was married until late 2015 to Shaun Woodward (an MP who defected from the Conservative Party to Labour). Jessica is married to Peter Frankopan.

==Honours==
* In 1992 he was appointed a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, giving him the honorific title &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;.
* In the 1995 New Year Honours list he was awarded a knighthood. This entitles him to be referred to as &quot;Sir Timothy Sainsbury&quot;.

<text>In evolutionary genetics, mutational meltdown is a sub class of extinction vortex in which the environment and genetic predisposition mutually reinforce each other. Mutational meltdown (not to be confused with the concept of an error catastrophe) is the accumulation of harmful mutations in a small population, which leads to loss of fitness and decline of the population size, which may lead to further accumulation of deleterious mutations due to fixation by genetic drift. 

A population experiencing mutational meltdown is trapped in a downward spiral and will go extinct if the phenomenon lasts for some time. Usually, the deleterious mutations would simply be selected away, but during a mutational meltdown, the number of individuals not reproducing (e.g. by suffering an early death) is too large relative to the overall population size so that mortality exceeds the birth rate.

== Explanation ==
The mechanism behind mutational meltdown is that a spontaneous deleterious mutation is introduced and after some time is eventually fixed into the population. This, in turn, leads to an accumulation in small populations where the growth rate as well as the population size both decrease. This, in consequence, allows the mutation to accumulate new deleterious alleles into the population until it is eventually extinct. In more detail, the accumulation of mutations in small populations can be divided into three phases. In the second phase a population starts in mutation/selection equilibrium, mutations are fixed at a constant rate through time, and the population size is constant because the fecundity exceeds mortality. However, after a sufficient number of mutations have been fixed in the population, the birth rate is slightly less than the death rate, and the population size begins to decrease. This is due to the fixation of deleterious mutations, which increases the death rate. The death rate eventually becomes too large in the population, theoretically infinite, that the time that it takes the deleterious mutant alleles to be fixated can be equated to the mean fixation time of a neutral mutation. This is only due to the small population that mutation is affecting, where the time for fixation is comparatively short. The smaller population size allows for more rapid fixation of deleterious mutations, and a more rapid decline of population size, which becomes irreversible after a certain number of generations

== Effects compared on asexual and sexual populations ==
In asexual species, the effects of mutation accumulation are more significant compared to sexual species. In an asexual population, all the individual species are equally affected by the selective pressures from the environment, which includes, deleterious and/or beneficial mutations. This is due to the lack of recombination of alleles and diversity in the genome that allows the accumulation of mutations to effectively take over the asexual population. The accumulation of mutation can occur during a short period of time, and this is because the offspring of the species that were introduced to the deleterious mutation does not have a recombination of alleles passed on by the parents. Instead, the exact copy and number of genes that were originally in the parent species is passed on to the offspring with no genetic changes. This puts asexual reproductive species under the high selective pressure of mutational meltdown. 

In sexual reproducing species, the time it takes for the mutational meltdown to occur takes longer, if at all. In sexually reproducing populations, the segregation and recombination of alleles allow genetic diversity to flourish within the population. Genetic diversity increases exponentially as the population gets larger over time. This, however; does not eliminate the chance of deleterious mutations to occur. An accumulation of deleterious alleles can do irreversible damage to the population before the species has time to reproduce. In simulated models of sexually reproductive species being introduced to an accumulation of deleterious alleles, it was shown that the population will not go extinct, or it takes an exponential amount of time to do so. This is due to if the sexually reproducing population was put under a strong selection for deleterious mutation, that it causes most of the population to be eliminated. The individuals in the population that do survive will have a lower fitness level, as well as overcome the accumulation of different deleterious mutations, even though their genome might have resistance to the previous deleterious mutations. 

The extinction based on mutational accumulation on sexual species, unlike asexual species, is under the assumption that the population is small or is highly restricted in genetic recombination. However; even under certain conditions in a large population, a mutational meltdown can still occur in sexually reproducing species. Factors that include low birth and recombination rate, as well as having a strong mutation-selection, can cause a large sexually reproducing population to go extinct. In contrast, the same conditions that can cause extinction in a sexually reproducing population can aid in the avoidance of mutation meltdown. In a tested environment, where variables can be theoretically manipulated, the strong mutation-selection in a large sexually reproducing population can be prevented from mutational meltdown if the birth rate were to increase. 

The effect on both asexual and sexually reproducing populations is still confounding to external variables. In cases where a large sexually reproducing population underwent a bottleneck, the population can become more susceptible to mutations accumulating in the population at a fast occurring rate. Mutational meltdown relies on external variables aside from small population size to eliminate the allelic frequency of a population. In such cases, mutational meltdown relies on genetic drift, in terms of a small population, to have time for the mutation to be fixated in the population.

==Mutational meltdown in an altruistic population==
The filamentous multicellular bacterium &quot;Streptomyces coelicolor&quot; forms colonies in which a subpopulation of cells arise that hyperproduce beneficial, but metabolically costly antibiotics. This results in a division of labor that increases overall colony fitness. Because the antibiotic producing cells contain large genomic deletions that cause a massive reduction to individual fitness, their altruistic behavior is similar to that of altruistic castes in social insects or somatic cells in multicellular organisms. Over successive generations these putatively altruistic cells continue to decline in fitness losing more fragments from their chromosomes while undergoing a roughly 10-fold increase in mutation rate, possibly due to mutations in genes for DNA replication and DNA repair. These changes lead to an inevitable and irreversible type of mutational meltdown.

<text>The Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) is a small insect-eating bird of the tyrant flycatcher family.

== Description ==
Adults have olive upperparts, darker on the wings and tail, with whitish underparts; they have a white eye ring, white wing bars and a wide bill. The breast is washed with olive. The upper part of the bill is dark; the lower part is yellowish. This bird&#x27;s song is an explosive &quot;peet-sa&quot;. The call is a soft &quot;peet&quot;. They also have a call similar to that of the northern flicker. A unique two-note song described as &quot;ka-zeep&quot; helps to identify this species.

Measurements:

* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

== Taxonomy ==
The 15 species of this genus were once all thought to be a single species, which was discovered in Acadia in present-day Nova Scotia. Differences in range, voice, and habitat eventually identified them as separate species. The present-day &quot;Acadian flycatcher&quot; is not found in Acadia.

== Distribution ==
Its breeding habitat is deciduous forests, often near water, across the eastern United States and southwestern Ontario. These birds migrate through eastern Mexico and the Caribbean to southern Central America and the very northwest of South America in Colombia, western Venezuela, and Ecuador.

The numbers of these birds have declined somewhat in the southern parts of their range. Brown-headed cowbirds lay eggs in the nests of these birds in some areas. However, only 16% of cowbird young in Acadian flycatcher nests fledge successfully.

They wait on a perch in the middle of a tree and fly out to catch insects in flight (hawking), also sometimes picking insects from foliage while hovering (gleaning). They may eat some berries and seeds.

They make a loose cup nest in a horizontal fork in a tree or shrub.

The Acadian flycatcher is an excellent flier; it is extremely maneuverable, can hover, and can even fly backward. Curiously, there is no scientific information on hopping or walking by this bird.

As of October 2015 there have been 2 records of Acadian flycatcher in Europe, the first being a bird found dead in Iceland in 1967, and the second a bird found on the beach at Dungeness in Kent, England in September 2015, the latter&#x27;s identity being established by DNA from its droppings.

<doc id="417710" wikidata="Q7257827" url="?curid=417710" title="Public holidays in Puerto Rico">
<text>Puerto Rico celebrates all official U.S. holidays, and other official holidays established by the Commonwealth government. 
Additionally, many municipalities celebrate their own Patron Saint Festivals (&quot;fiestas patronales&quot; in Spanish), as well as festivals honoring cultural icons like &quot;bomba y plena&quot;, &quot;danza&quot;, salsa, &quot;hamacas&quot; (hammocks), and popular crops such as plantains and coffee.

Until June 30, 2014, there were 19 public holidays in Puerto Rico. As a result of a new Commonwealth law, after July 1, 2014, the Commonwealth government consolidated three of its former holidays (Luis Muñoz Rivera, José Celso Barbosa, and Luis Muñoz Marín) into just one called &quot;Día de los Próceres Puertorriqueños&quot; (The Day of Illustrious Puerto Ricans), and reducing the number of holidays observed publicly to 17. As part of the new law, the third Monday of February became &quot;Día de los Próceres Puertorriqueños&quot; when, in addition to commemorating the birth of those three illustrious Puerto Ricans will also include commemorating the birthdays of four other illustrious Puerto Ricans – Ramón Emeterio Betances, Román Baldorioty de Castro, Ernesto Ramos Antonini and Luis A. Ferré. The law mandated that the Eugenio María de Hostos holiday and the José de Diego holiday would continue to be observed on their respective days as usual.

==Official public holidays==
Official public holidays are those recognized by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government. All public offices must close. Many businesses also elect to close. These public holidays include both federal and commonwealth-established holidays, since Puerto Rico recognizes all U.S. federal holidays.

<doc id="417717" wikidata="Q338167" url="?curid=417717" title="Tenderloin, Manhattan">
<text>The Tenderloin was an entertainment and red-light district in the heart of the New York City borough of Manhattan during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The area originally ran from 24th Street to 42nd Street and from Fifth Avenue to Seventh Avenue. By the turn of the 20th century, it had expanded northward to 57th or 62nd Street and west to Eighth Avenue, encompassing parts of what is now NoMad, Chelsea, Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, the Garment District and the Theater District.

== Etymology ==
New York Police Department Captain Alexander S. &quot;Clubber&quot; Williams gave the area its nickname in 1876, when he was transferred to a police precinct in the heart of this district. Referring to the increased number of bribes he would receive for police protection of both legitimate and illegitimate businesses there – especially the many brothels – Williams said, &quot;I&#x27;ve been having chuck steak ever since I&#x27;ve been on the force, and now I&#x27;m going to have a bit of tenderloin.&quot;

The name became a generic term for a red-light district in an American city; San Francisco is among the other cities with a well-known &quot;Tenderloin District&quot;.

==History==
Early in the 19th century, the major vice district had been located in what is now SoHo, called at the time &quot;Hells&#x27; Hundred Acres&quot;, but as the city grew steadily northward, the theater district along Broadway and the Bowery moved uptown as well, as did the legitimate and illegitimate businesses that were usually connected with show business. For some time, the city&#x27;s &quot;Rialto&quot; theater district centered on Union Square and 14th Street, but the Fifth Avenue Hotel broke new ground when it opened at 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue in 1859, beginning the expansion of the Union Square Rialto to 23rd Street and Madison Square. By the 1870s, the Fifth Avenue Hotel had many competitors in the area, and where the hotels were, the prostitutes followed.

By the 1880s, the Tenderloin encompassed the largest number of nightclubs, saloons, bordellos, gambling casinos, dance halls, and &quot;clip joints&quot; in New York City, to the extent that one estimate made in 1885 was that half of the buildings in the district were connected with vice. Reformers referred to the area as &quot;Satan&#x27;s Circus&quot;, and one anti-vice crusading minister, the Rev. Thomas De Witt Talmage, denounced the entire city of New York as &quot;the modern Gomorrah&quot; for allowing it to exist.

The clientele of these establishments was not necessarily working-class: one set of seven sisters ran side-by-side brothels in a residential neighborhood on West 25th Street, inviting their upper class customers with engraved invitations. On some nights only gentlemen in formal evening dress were allowed to attend, and the girls of these houses were as socially adept as they were sexually; on Christmas Eve profits were given to charity.

Other well-known venues in the Tenderloin included Koster and Bial&#x27;s Music Hall at Sixth Avenue and 23rd Street, a concert saloon where inebriated customers could watch the can-can being performed; the Haymarket, a dance hall on Sixth below 30th Street, where rich clients could dance with prostitutes, but not too closely, although they could take them into curtained-off galleries to have discreet sex, and sex exhibitions were on display in the balconies; West 29th Street, which featured an almost uninterrupted row of brothels; and the many gambling dens run by John Daly or the Madison Square Club of Richard A. Canfield on West 26th Street.


The &quot;Main Street&quot; of the district was Broadway between 23rd and 42nd Streets, which was known as &quot;The Line&quot;. In the mid-1890s, after the advent of electric lighting, the stretch of Broadway from 23rd Street to 34th Street came to be called &quot;The Great White Way&quot; because of the numerous illuminated advertising signs there. This moniker was transferred to Times Square when the theater district moved uptown.

Eventually, the processes which created the Tenderloin also served to dismantle it. Once again, theaters and hotels began moving uptown, and the brothels and dance halls and so on followed after them. As early as 1906, McAdoo noted that the northern boundary of the district had moved to 62nd Street, and the &quot;New Tenderloin&quot;, as he called it, was now bounded by 42nd Street on the south. The movement, he said, &quot;is rapidly depleting the ranks of the sporting vicious element in the Old Tenderloin&quot;.

== Crime ==
Crime was also a major aspect of the Tenderloin, which was considered to be the worst crime-ridden area of what was thought to be the most crime-ridden city of the United States. To a certain extent, police corruption kept crime under control as it regularized the financial relationship between the police and the criminals, but the area was too large, and the pickings too easy, for street crime to be managed completely. In 1906, William McAdoo, who was the city&#x27;s Police Commissioner in 1904 and 1905, wrote that the &quot;Tenderloin [police] precinct, as every one knows, is the most important precinct in New York, if not in the United States, or probably in the world, from the amount of police business done there and from the character of the neighborhood.&quot;

Occasionally there would be organized attempts to clean up the Tenderloin, and reformist mayors, such as William Russell Grace and Abram S. Hewitt, would authorize raids on saloons and brothels, even those under the protection of &quot;Clubber&quot; Williams, but the effects were generally temporary: prostitutes would decamp to outlying areas, and return when the latest crusade was over. The net effect of these &quot;shake-ups&quot; or &quot;shake-downs&quot; was simply to drive up the cost of protection afterwards, making Williams even richer – he retired a millionaire – and putting more money into the pockets of Tammany Hall, which was deeply entwined in the graft and corruption connected with the district.

Frustration at this state of affairs led to Anthony Comstock&#x27;s anti-vice crusade, which operated with Federal authority from the Post Office and with the support of the New York Chamber of Commerce and leading citizens such as J. P. Morgan. Comstock&#x27;s crusade knew no boundaries – he was as likely to target &quot;smut&quot; in the public libraries as he was sex-for-hire in the Tenderloin – but along with Rev. Talmage, he was able to get state legislation passed banning pool halls, even though they continued to operate openly.

=== Anti-Black mob and police riot ===

Aside from its commercial activities, the Tenderloin was also the home neighborhood for a large part of Manhattan&#x27;s African American population, especially in the downtown and western portion of the district: Seventh Avenue within the Tenderloin, in fact, became known as the &quot;African Broadway&quot;. This was a neighborhood of Blacks with middle class aspirations.
In August 1900, an undercover police officer attempted to arrest a Black woman for soliciting. The woman&#x27;s boyfriend intervened and the officer struck him with a club. He then stabbed the officer with a penknife, and ran away. The officer died. At the officer&#x27;s funeral, police and white gangs attacked African Americans, and burned their property while other police officers looked on. In defense, Black citizens armed themselves and formed the Citizens’ Protective League. Their appeals for justice to Mayor Robert A. Van Wyck went unanswered, and the state and the Police Boards did nothing.

==In popular culture==
* The Tenderloin of the early 20th century is described from a police perspective in &quot;Behind the Green Lights&quot;, the memoirs of Police Captain Cornelius Willemse.
* Owen Davis set a series of stories for the &quot;Police Gazette&quot; in the dance halls and restaurants of the district, and often referred to that section of Broadway running through the district as &quot;The Line&quot;. The stories were later collected as &quot;Sketches of Gotham&quot; (1906) under the pseudonym &quot;Ike Swift&quot;. They chronicled the high jinks and low life of the Tenderloin as it was between the 1890s and World War I in a lively and memorable manner. Swift described the district so:
It may be that you -whoever you are or wherever you are- don’t know what it means to go “down the line”. But in New York -in order that we may start right- “The Line” means that part of Broadway where at night the lights burn brightest, and where the mob -swell and otherwise- move back and forth like the ebb and flow of the tide - hunting, hunting, ever on the hunt.

From Twenty-third street to Forty-second, and back again, and you have gone down The Line. Sometimes it costs you nothing for this innocent little amusement; this feast of the eyes; and then again it is liable to cost you a great deal.

It all depends on who you are, and what you are and how easy you are.

And there you are.

*The now-lost film &quot;Tenderloin&quot; was a crime film taking place in the Tenderloin district.
* The brothels of the Tenderloin, repeatedly raided by Anthony Comstock&#x27;s vice squad, were the setting for the 1960 musical &quot;Tenderloin&quot; by Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock, based on a novel by Samuel Hopkins Adams
* The Tenderloin, at the turn of the 20th century, is the setting for one of author Victoria Thompson&#x27;s Gaslight Mysteries, &quot;Murder on Sisters&#x27; Row&quot;.
* The Cinemax television series &quot;The Knick&quot; featured the 1900 race riot in the season one episode &quot;Get the Rope&quot;.
* The Ubisoft game &quot;The Division&quot; features an area on the map labeled Tenderloin.
* The TNT and Netflix series &quot;The Alienist&quot; centres on crimes committed in or linked to The Tenderloin. The series is based loosely on characters created by Caleb Carr in the novel of the same title.

<text>Caroline Frances Jackson (born 5 November 1946 in Penzance, Cornwall) is a politician in the United Kingdom. She was a Member of the European Parliament for the Conservative Party from 1984 to 2009.

== Early career ==
Before she became an MEP, Jackson was a Research Fellow at St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford, where she obtained a doctorate in 19th century political history. She also studied at Nuffield College, Oxford. She worked at the Conservative Research Department from 1973 to 1974 and fought the constituency of Birmingham Erdington in the February 1974 General Election. She then became a member of the research team supporting the first British Conservative MEPs from 1974 to 1984.

== Member of the European Parliament ==
She was elected to represent the Wiltshire constituency from 1984 to 1994, then the new Wiltshire North and Bath constituency from 1994 to 1999 and from 1999 to 2009 served as an MEP for the South West England constituency.

In the European Parliament, she was a leading member of the Environment Committee and between 1999 and 2004 was chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Consumer Protection and Public Health. During her chairmanship she tried to focus attention as much on Member States&#x27; performance in transposing and applying new EU laws as on the adoption of more such laws. This was during a period of very intense legislation in the area of water and air pollution, waste disposal and controls on chemicals. Jackson controlled the committee firmly but with humour – qualities very necessary when German opponents of new laws on alternative medicines attempted to control proceedings in 1995. It was noted that on 11 September 2001 Jackson&#x27;s committee was the only one that did not adjourn when the news of the attacks on New York came through: Jackson argued that abrupt abandonment of the Committee&#x27;s work would have been another small victory for the terrorists. Jackson has been described by Liberal Democrat MEP Chris Davies thus: &quot;She&#x27;s been here forever: a bit &#x27;jolly hockey sticks&#x27; but firm, fair and funny.&quot;

Jackson specialised, as parliamentary rapporteur, on waste legislation. She took the Landfill Directive through the Parliament in 1997–8. In 2008 she was rapporteur on the Waste Framework Directive. Initially criticised as being too close to the waste industry lobby, Jackson managed to unite most of her opponents in support of an ambitious final text which the Council of Ministers only agreed with reluctance. This placed an obligation on Member States to achieve recycling rates of 50% by 2020, created for the Commission the possibility of putting in place waste reduction targets and cleared up the question of the status of incineration of waste as a form of &quot;recovery&quot; rather than &quot;disposal&quot;.

Jackson believed that David Cameron was wrong to direct the Conservative MEPs to leave the European People&#x27;s Party in 2009 because this meant a huge loss of political influence. She pointed out that the Conservatives had in fact enjoyed a high level of political independence within the EPP. She argued that the Conservatives&#x27; new position from 2009 in the &quot;Conservatives and European Reformists group&quot; with the Czech ODS party, the Polish Law and Justice party and a motley crew of European rightists, would mean that they would lose influence and visibility in the European Parliament at precisely the moment when the Parliament&#x27;s powers were increasing. She made her views known in press articles in 2009 and Cameron feared that she might follow her husband, Robert V. Jackson, MP for Wantage (1983-2005) in abandoning the Conservative party for the Labour Party. But she remained a Conservative and the party paid tribute to her work when she left the Parliament, William Hague pointing out that Jackson was &quot;always ahead of the curve&quot;.

She retired at the 2009 European Parliament Elections.

== Subsequent career ==
She now works as an environmental consultant. She is a member of the Foresight Advisory Council of GDF Suez Environment and a board member of the Institute for European Environmental Policy.

<doc id="417728" wikidata="Q2425943" url="?curid=417728" title="Tom Davis (Virginia politician)">
<text>Thomas Milburn Davis III (born January 5, 1949) is an American lobbyist and former Republican member of the United States House of Representatives who represented Virginia&#x27;s 11th congressional district in Northern Virginia. Davis was considering a run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by five-term incumbent and fellow Republican John Warner in the 2008 election, but decided against it. He announced on January 30, 2008, that he would not seek reelection to an eighth term. Davis resigned from Congress on November 24, 2008.

From 2008 to 2018, he was a director of federal government affairs at Deloitte. He is currently the rector (head of the Board of Visitors) of George Mason University and a trustee of its Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study. In January 2019, he began work as a partner in the law firm Holland and Knight.

==Early life and education==
Davis was born in Minot, North Dakota, and moved to Fairfax County in Virginia at an early age. He was a U.S. Senate Page and graduated as president of the senior class at the United States Capitol Page School in 1967. He is a graduate of Amherst College and the University of Virginia School of Law. He attended Officer Candidate School of the U.S. Army, served on active duty, and spent eight years with the Virginia National Guard and the U.S. Army Reserve.

==Early career==
He is the former vice president and general counsel at government contractor PRC, Inc., former chairman of the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission, and former president of the Washington Metropolitan Council of Governments.

==Political career==
Davis was a member of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors from 1980 to 1994, serving as chairman of the Board of Supervisors from 1991 until his election to the House. During his service as board chairman, Fairfax County was ranked first financially by &quot;City and State&quot; magazine in their list of Top 50 Counties.

===Congressional career===

Davis won election to the House in 1994, the year of the Republican Contract with America. Davis defeated one-term incumbent Leslie Byrne. The Contract with America called for citizen-legislators who would retire after 12 years, instead of career politicians. Davis signed the Contract and voted in favor of the Citizens Legislature Act; however, the bill did not achieve support from the 2/3 majority needed for the amendment to pass. Although the 11th was considered a swing district, Davis was reelected five more times without substantive opposition in part due to his popularity in Fairfax County. Democrats did not field a candidate against him in 1998 and 2002.

In the 2006 Democratic wave, when Democrats took the House for the first time since 1994, Davis faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from Democrat Andrew Hurst, but was reelected with 55 percent of the vote, which was his lowest total since his initial bid against Byrne. Nonetheless, he began fundraising for a Senate bid in 2007. In his 2004 term, on what the &quot;Washington Post&quot; deemed to be his then-most recent &quot;key votes&quot;, Davis voted 10 times out of the last 13 times (77 percent) for the Republican Party position. On a series of 1,700 votes reported by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Davis voted over 89 percent of the time in favor of the Republican position. Nevertheless, Davis was sometimes described as a moderate; he supported some abortion rights and voting rights for the District of Columbia, and opposed a state car tax phase-out in 2006.

Davis was chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) from 1998 to 2002. According to &quot;The Federal Paper&quot;, he then sought the chairmanship of the House Government Oversight and Reform Committee. Davis had less seniority than the other contenders for this chairmanship, but some Republicans wanted to reward him for his work as NRCC chairman, including his supervision of a $160 million fundraising effort. Davis&#x27;s deputy on the NRCC, Tom Reynolds of New York, became the next NRCC chairman.

===House Committee on Government Reform===
In 2003, Davis became Chairman of the House Government Reform Committee. He served as Chairman until 2007, when Democrats became the majority party in the House of Representatives. Henry Waxman of California replaced Davis at the gavel. Davis had renamed the committee, removing &quot;Oversight&quot; from the title; one of Waxman&#x27;s first acts as Chair was to reinstitute the name as the &quot;House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform&quot;. The committee was the chief investigative and oversight committee of the House, and was granted broad jurisdiction. This committee was very active during the Clinton administration. It issued 1,052 subpoenas to probe alleged misconduct by the administration and the Democratic Party between 1997 and 2002. By contrast, by the end of the 2005 session, Davis and the majority had only permitted three subpoenas to be issued to the George W. Bush administration, including one to the United States Department of Defense over documents related to Hurricane Katrina.

====ICG government====
Davis&#x27;s second wife, Jeannemarie Devolites-Davis, was one of the first hires (as a part-time consultant) for ICG Government, a firm that assists businesses in understanding procuring government contracts. Their financial relationship, along with financial ties that benefit family members of 64 of the 435 voting members of Congress, was highlighted in the June 2007 ethics report, &quot;Family Affair&quot; by the CREW.

At the time of her hire at ICG, Davis was her mentor and campaign manager. After being hired, Devolites married Davis. On July 28, 2006, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that the Defense Information Systems Agency had reviewed its satellite contract with Artel, Inc., and the agency had preliminarily determined that the contract was ineffective and expensive. Artel then hired ICG for consulting services. ICG drafted a letter Davis signed to the agency threatening an investigation by his committee if the contract was not awarded. After the &quot;Post&quot; articles appeared, Davis sought an opinion from the House Ethics Committee. They advised him to be careful to avoid the appearance of any conflict in this matter. &quot;The Post&quot; published an extensive article on the issue, the company had to register as a lobbyist, and ICG removed a picture from the front page of its website of Davis speaking to ICG clients.

His wife continued to work for ICG, which paid her $78,000 in 2005 for working 10 to 20 hours a week, primarily at home on her cell phone. She was making $18,000 a year as a Virginia legislator. Her bio was the only one on the ICG site to name her spouse. The same &quot;Post&quot; writers continued the investigation of oversight of contractual influence by the committee and its chair in November and December 2006.

====Major League Baseball team in Washington====
Davis was accused of threatening Major League Baseball with an investigation when a consortium that included George Soros offered to buy the Washington Nationals.
&quot;I think Major League Baseball understands the stakes&quot;, Davis told &quot;Roll Call&quot; magazine. &quot;I don&#x27;t think they want to get involved in the political fights.&quot; Davis, who convened some congressional hearings about steroid use, added, &quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the Nats that get hurt. I think it&#x27;s Major League Baseball that gets hurt. They enjoy all sorts of exemptions from antitrust laws.&quot;

====Transportation development positions====
Davis also appeared at a local zoning meeting to oppose a &quot;smart growth&quot; plan near the Vienna Metro station. Approval of the project, to build what was called a &quot;mini-city&quot; within walking distance of the Metro, was considered routine. Some of the longest commutes to work in the nation begin in Virginia—second only to New York City—and in Prince William County in particular. The project was a key resolution to congestion in the congressional district. Davis&#x27;s pledge to approve the legislation led several county supervisors to accuse him of meddling in a local land-use issue.

One politician who spoke to Davis said the congressman told him that he opposed Pulte Homes&#x27; MetroWest project because &quot;all it does is produce Democrats&quot;.

In July 2006, Davis wrote a letter to Virginia&#x27;s then-Governor Tim Kaine discouraging the state from constructing an underground Metrorail through Tysons Corner. According to a July 17, 2006, story in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Davis said switching to a tunnel in Tysons would require reviews that could delay the rail line by as much as two years. On February 26, 2007, &quot;The Post&quot; reported that Davis had switched positions.

====Jennifer and David Safavian====
One of 12 counsels for oversight and investigations on the House Government Reform Committee was Jennifer Safavian, wife of David Safavian, the first person convicted in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal. She is now the Staff Director for the House Ways and Means Committee. A former legislative director for Davis submitted a request that he receive no jail time, but the judge ruled David Safavian&#x27;s conduct merited incarceration. The judge&#x27;s decision was reversed on June 17, 2008, by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

David Safavian had replaced Angela Styles, who was forced from the General Services Administration after Davis wrote letters to her bosses at the Office of Management and Budget. He had written to Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. and Joshua Bolten, Styles&#x27;s superiors at the Office of Management and Budget.

Prior to his GSA job, Safavian had no government contracts experience. He did have connections to Davis, as a lobbyist with Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform (ATR), he worked closely with the NRCC when Davis was chair, and presented Davis with an ATR award.&quot; ATR has been found to have operated as tax-exempt despite not qualifying for tax-exempt status.

===Schiavo subpoena===
Among notable controversies involving the committee under Davis was the Terri Schiavo case. The committee subpoena, signed by Davis, ordered the appearance of Schiavo, her husband, Michael, and her doctors. The subpoenas specified that the witnesses bring to the hearing &quot;all medical and other equipment that provides nutrition and hydration...in its current and continuing state of operations.&quot; Davis issued a joint statement with House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-TX) and Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (R-IL) that stated: &quot;This inquiry should give hope to Terri, her parents and friends, and the millions of people throughout the world who are praying for her safety. This fight is not over.&quot; Many legal scholars criticized this action as an inappropriate congressional intervention in an ongoing court case that defied the rule of law and amounted to a bill of attainder—not against the party the politicians are attempting to aid, but against the party on the other side of the courtroom.

===K Street Project and NRCC fundraising===
As chairman of the NRCC, Davis&#x27;s chief responsibility was fundraising for members of Congress, and his work overlapped with the financial efforts of the Republican Party&#x27;s K Street Project and the fundraising scandals involving Abramoff and DeLay. Davis himself signed an NRCC check for $500,000 in 1999, the largest amount donated by the NRCC, while he was chair of the committee. The NRCC was fined by the Federal Election Commission for transferring the funds because it was transferred between political action committees for the same candidates in violation of contribution limits. The PAC involved, the U.S. Family Network, is connected with Abramoff, Bob Ney, and Willie Tan, a businessman in the Northern Mariana Islands, all currently associated with a political scandal.

===Legislative activity===
Davis was chair of the Select Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina. Democrats, who had proposed an independent investigation, objected and did not officially take part in the committee. The committee proceeded, eventually producing a stinging report critical of government&#x27;s response to the disaster.

Davis introduced the bill that became the Elizabeth Morgan Act, passed in 1996. In 2003, a federal appeals court ruled that the act was an unconstitutional bill of attainder.

Davis has been instrumental in getting federal funding for the replacement of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge.

Davis sponsored legislation creating a financial control board for Washington, D.C. He was in charge, until 2000, of the Government Reform Committee&#x27;s Subcommittee on the District of Columbia, generally favoring allowing the District government more autonomy.

Apparently in a surprise to the House Judiciary Committee, the Reform Committee passed HR 2043 (the DC Fair and Equal House Voting Rights Act), a bill Davis introduced to provide the District of Columbia with voting representation in Congress. This bill differs from other bills that would grant the district the right to elect representatives. HR 2043 requires the addition of two representatives, one in Washington, D.C., and one in Utah, by raising the number of Representatives from 435 to 437. Originally, the number of House seats would return to 435 after the 2010 Census, with Washington, D.C. retaining a full vote in the House., but later versions of the bill make the expansion to 437 seats permanent. The bill did not make it to the House floor, however.

The bill was reintroduced, cosponsored by Davis, as the &quot;District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007&quot;, as H.R. 1433 in the 110th Congress. The bill permanently increases the size of the House by two members. One seat will go to the District of Columbia and the other seat will go to the next state in line to get a congressional seat. Based on the 2000 decennial census and apportionment calculations, Utah will get the second seat until the reapportionment taking place after the 2010 Decennial Census. On March 13, 2007 it passed the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform with a vote of 24–5.

===2004 and 2006 election campaigns===

Davis&#x27;s congressional district was redistricted after the 2000 census, which increased the percentage of Republicans in the district. In 2004, he defeated his relatively unknown Democratic challenger, Ken Longmyer, by a 59 percent to 39 percent margin. In the race, Davis outspent Longmyer, $1,835,000 to $72,000.

In the November 2006 election, Davis defeated Democrat Andrew Hurst by 11 percentage points. It was the closest and costliest race Davis faced in 12 years. In financing his campaign, Davis outspent Hurst almost 9-to-1, $2,607,125 to $310,561.

Independent Green Party co-founder, businessman Joseph Oddo was on the ballot in 2004. Ferdinado Greco, a physicist, George Mason University grad, owner and operator of a hybrid taxi business, was the Independent Green candidate in 2006.

==Initial steps toward a 2008 Senate campaign==
On September 15, 2007, Davis told WTOP&#x27;s &quot;Politics Program&quot; that he was running for the Senate seat being vacated by John Warner. He said that he has been assembling money and staff for the contest, but was delaying a formal announcement until November. It had been presumed that he would face former Governor Jim Gilmore for the nomination. However, the state Republican Party opted to choose its nominee at a nominating convention rather than in a primary.

Davis argued that a primary would expose the candidates to the kind of environment they would face in November. It was also thought that a primary would have favored Davis due to his popularity in voter-rich Northern Virginia. In contrast, the delegates at the nominating convention would have been made up mostly of party activists; the state&#x27;s Republican activist base is much more conservative than the primary and general electorates. Gilmore had argued strongly for a convention, claiming that a primary would leave the winner short of cash; he is also much more conservative than Davis, and would therefore have likely been the favorite at the convention. Funding was no small consideration, as the race for the Democratic nomination essentially ended when former Governor Mark Warner announced his candidacy. Warner was one of the state&#x27;s most popular politicians, and had the ability to self-finance his campaign due to his considerable personal fortune.

The party opted for a convention, and Davis therefore announced in October 2007 that he would not run for the Senate. Gilmore was nominated, and lost the general election to Warner in a landslide. Davis also did not run for reelection to his House seat, and was replaced by Democrat Gerry Connolly.

Davis told the National Press Club in 2007 that he was considering later mounting a challenge to Virginia&#x27;s other Senator, Jim Webb, in 2012. Ultimately, he did not enter that race.

==Post-congressional career==
On November 17, 2008, Davis joined Deloitte Consulting in their Washington, D.C. office. He resigned from Congress on November 24, 2008.

Davis served as president and CEO of the Republican Main Street Partnership, a moderate Republican organization.

He has also started teaching a class at George Mason University, called &quot;Southern Politics&quot; in the 2008 Fall Semester. In the Spring and Fall of 2010, Davis taught Political Parties and Campaigns. The course is described as &quot;Characteristics and functions of political parties, influence of parties and other political forces on electoral decisions, and emphasis on parties&#x27; inability or ability to hold government accountable to citizens&quot; in the catalog. Former Virginia U.S. Representative Jim Moran also teaches the class with him.

On December 21, 2010, it was announced that Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell appointed Davis to be a member of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Board of Directors, filling one of the five seats on the Board allotted to Virginia.

In August 2014 Davis was named rector of George Mason University. He had been on the university&#x27;s Board of Visitors since 2013.

Davis is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One, a group of former members of congress, governors and cabinet officials dedicated to campaign finance reform.

In 2019, he left his position at Deloitte and became a lobbyist for the Holland &amp; Knight law firm.

==Political positions==
Davis&#x27;s district is in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. He was active in efforts to change federal procurement and contracting practices that make it faster to award contracts but also easier to award no-bid, &quot;cost-plus&quot; and &quot;share in savings&quot; contracts. These contracts especially involved the GSA and the Department of Homeland Security. Critics of the reforms pointed to the increasing campaign contributions from beneficiaries of the contracts and a reduction in audit and auditors, oversight, and performance by contractors after the changes.

Tom Davis was one of only eleven Republicans to vote against the Contract with America Tax Relief Act
that cut taxes by $189 billion over five years, including lowering the capital gains tax rate and easing the &quot;marriage penalty,&quot; and supported a tax hike referendum to raise sales taxes in northern Virginia by 4.5 to 5%.

He also went against his party by supporting District of Columbia voting rights, and introduced &quot;The District of Columbia Fair and Equal House Voting Rights Act of 2006&quot; before the house. However, this bill never made it out of committee.

Davis supported Virginia&#x27;s Right-to-work law, which was opposed by organized labor.

In 2006, Davis said he opposed amnesty for illegal immigrants and supported H.R. 4437, an immigration reform bill sponsored by Rep. James Sensenbrenner.

Davis voted to support stem cell research. He was a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership, a group of Republicans who describe themselves as &quot;mainstream&quot;.

In 2007, expressing disapproval with the Democratic Party resolution disapproving of the Iraq troop surge, Davis nevertheless broke with his party line to vote for the resolution.

Project Vote Smart reported that Davis has high approval ratings from business groups, but significantly lower ratings from groups that support abortion rights, environmental protection, and civil liberties.

In 2012, Davis was elected president of the Federal City Council, a group of business, civic, education, and other leaders interested in economic development in Washington, D.C.

==Personal life==
Davis is a member of the Christian Science Church.

In 1973, Davis married Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Rantz, a medical doctor. They have three children together. He divorced her in late 2003 and announced his intention to marry Jeannemarie Devolites in February 2004. They married in June of that year. Davis&#x27;s first public involvement with Devolites was in 1997 when he managed her campaign for the Virginia House of Delegates, her fourth campaign and first successful one, and was her biggest campaign contributor. In 2003 she was elected to the Virginia State Senate, serving one term before her defeat for re-election in 2007. Davis&#x27;s political action committees gave her more than $172,000 by mid-2006. He has four stepdaughters from this marriage.

<doc id="417730" wikidata="Q941612" url="?curid=417730" title="American Airlines Flight 965">
<text>American Airlines Flight 965 was a regularly scheduled flight from Miami International Airport in Miami, Florida, to Alfonso Bonilla Aragón International Airport in Cali, Colombia. On December 20, 1995, the Boeing 757-200 flying this route (registration ) crashed into a mountain in Buga, Colombia, around 9:40 pm killing 151 of the 155 passengers and all eight crew members.

The crash was the first U.S.-owned 757 accident and is currently the deadliest aviation accident to occur in Colombia. It was also the deadliest accident involving a Boeing 757 at that time, but was surpassed by Birgenair Flight 301 which crashed seven weeks later with 189 fatalities. Flight 965 was the deadliest air disaster involving a U.S. carrier since the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988.

The Colombian Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics investigated the accident and determined it was caused by navigational errors by the flight crew.

== Aircraft ==
The aircraft involved in the accident was a Boeing 757–223 registered N651AA. It was the 390th Boeing 757 built. The aircraft was powered by two Rolls-Royce RB211 engines.

==Crew==

The cockpit crew consisted of Captain Nicholas Tafuri (57), and First Officer Donald &quot;Don&quot; Williams (39). Both pilots were considered to be highly skilled airmen. Captain Tafuri had more than 13,000 hours of flying experience (including 2,260 hours on the Boeing 757/767), and First Officer Williams had almost 6,000 hours, with 2,286 of them on the Boeing 757/767.

Captain Tafuri had flown with the United States Air Force from 1963 to 1969 and served in the Vietnam War, and joined American Airlines in 1969. First Officer Williams had flown with the U.S. Air Force from 1979 to 1986, and joined American Airlines in 1986.

==Flight history==
===Departure===
At that time, Flight 965 mainly carried people returning to Colombia for the Christmas holiday, vacationers, and businesspeople. A winter storm in the Northeast United States caused the airline to delay the departure of the airliner for 30 minutes to allow for connecting passengers to board the flight, and seasonal congestion caused further delay. Flight 965 took off at 6:35 pm EST (23:35 UTC), nearly two hours late.

===Going off-course===
Cali&#x27;s air traffic controllers had no functional radar to monitor the 757, as it had been blown up in 1992 by the terror group FARC. Cali&#x27;s approach uses several radio beacons to guide pilots around the mountains and canyons that surround the city. The airplane&#x27;s flight management system (FMS) navigation computer already had these beacons programmed in, and should have, in theory, told the pilots exactly where to turn, climb, and descend, all the way from Miami to the terminal in Cali.

Since the wind was calm, Cali&#x27;s controllers asked the pilots whether they wanted to fly a non-precision straight-in approach to runway 19 rather than coming around for a precision ILS-approach to runway 01. The pilots agreed to the straight-in approach, hoping to make up some time. The pilots then mistakenly cleared all the programmed approach waypoints from the flight plan in the aircraft FMS. When the controller asked the pilots to report passing over the Tulua VOR (identified as &quot;ULQ&quot;) north of Cali, it was no longer programmed into the FMS flight plan, so they had to find the VOR identifier &quot;ULQ&quot; in their approach chart. In the meantime, they extended the aircraft&#x27;s speed brakes to slow it down and expedite its descent.

By the time the pilots had selected the Tulua VOR identifier &quot;ULQ&quot; into the FMS flight plan, they had already passed over it. The pilots then tried to select the next approach waypoint Rozo in the FMS. However, the Rozo non-directional beacon (NDB) was identified as &quot;R&quot; in their approach chart but not in the FMS. Instead the FMS database used a different naming convention and identified the Rozo NDB as &quot;ROZO&quot;. Colombia had also duplicated the identifier &quot;R&quot; for the Romeo NDB near Bogotá from Cali, which is not in line with the ICAO standard effective from 1978 to only duplicate identifiers if more than apart. By selecting &quot;R&quot; from the waypoint list, the captain caused the autopilot to start flying a course to Bogotá, resulting in the airplane turning east in a wide semicircle. The pilots then attempted to correct this by turning back to the south. By the time the error was detected, the aircraft was in a valley running roughly north–south parallel to the one they should have been in. The pilots had put the aircraft on a collision course with a mountain. The air traffic controller, Nelson Rivera Ramírez, believed that some of the requests of the pilots did not make sense, but did not know enough non-aviation English to convey this.

==Accident==

Twelve seconds before the plane hit the mountain, named (the Deluge), the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) activated, announcing an imminent terrain collision and sounding an alarm. Within a second of this warning, the first officer disengaged the autopilot, and the captain attempted to climb clear of the mountain. Within two seconds of the warning, take-off power was selected, and in the next second, pitch was increased to 20.6° upwards, causing activation of the stick shaker. The stick shaker mechanically vibrates the control yoke (the &quot;stick&quot;) to warn the flight crew of an imminent aerodynamic stall.

When take-off power was selected, neither pilot had remembered to disengage the previously deployed speed brakes, which were fully extended and significantly reduced the rate of climb. At 9:41:28 p.m. EST, the aircraft struck trees at about above mean sea level on the east side of the mountain. The last record on the flight data recorder indicated that the plane was flying at and with a pitch attitude of almost 28°. The crash was south of Tulua VOR and north of the approach end of runway 19 at Alfonso Bonilla Aragon International Airport. Initially, the aircraft cleared the summit, but struck the trees with the tail and crashed shortly after the summit.

Five passengers, all seated within two rows of each other, survived the initial impact, but one died two days later of his injuries. In addition to the four human survivors, a dog, which had been in a carrier in the cargo hold at the time of the crash, survived the accident.

== Investigation ==
The crash was investigated by the Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics () of the Republic of Colombia, with assistance from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), as well as other parties, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, Allied Pilots Association, American Airlines, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, and Rolls-Royce Engines.

The investigations revealed that neither the Boeing fixed-base simulator nor the flight management system simulator could be backdriven with the data obtained directly from the accident airplane&#x27;s flight data recorder (FDR). Because the 757 flight simulators could not be backdriven during the tests, whether the airplane would have missed the mountain/tree tops if the speedbrakes had been retracted during the climb attempt could not be determined with precision, but the final report stated that if the flightcrew had retracted the speedbrakes one second after initiating the escape maneuver, the airplane could have been climbing through a position that was above the initial impact point. Because the airplane would have continued to climb and had the potential to increase its rate of climb, it might well have cleared the trees at the top of the mountain.

The &quot;Civil Aeronautics&quot; prepared a final report of its investigation in September 1996, which was released through the U.S. NTSB.

In its report, the &quot;Civil Aeronautics&quot; determined these probable causes of the accident:
# The flight crew&#x27;s failure to adequately plan and execute the approach to runway 19 at SKCL and their inadequate use of automation
# Failure of the flight crew to discontinue the approach into Cali, despite numerous cues alerting them of the inadvisability of continuing the approach
# The lack of situational awareness of the flight crew regarding vertical navigation, proximity to terrain, and the relative location of critical radio aids
# Failure of the flight crew to revert to basic radio navigation at the time when the flight management system-assisted navigation became confusing and demanded an excessive workload in a critical phase of the flight

In addition, the &quot;Civil Aeronautics&quot; determined that these factors contributed to the accident:
# The flight crew&#x27;s ongoing efforts to expedite their approach and landing to avoid potential delays
# The flight crew&#x27;s execution of the ground proximity warning system escape maneuver while the speedbrakes remained deployed
# FMS logic that dropped all intermediate fixes from the display(s) in the event of execution of a direct routing
# FMS-generated navigational information that used a different naming convention from that published in navigational charts

The &quot;Civil Aeronautics&quot;&#x27;s report also included a variety of safety-related recommendations to the involved parties (number of individual recommendations in parentheses):

*U.S. FAA (17)
*International Civil Aviation Organization (3)
*American Airlines (2)

Investigators later labeled the accident a nonsurvivable event, citing the impact forces and subsequent destruction of the aircraft.

==Aftermath==
Scavengers took engine thrust reversers, cockpit avionics, and other components from the crashed 757, using Colombian military and private helicopters to go to and from the crash site. Many of the stolen components reappeared as unapproved aircraft parts on the black market in Greater Miami parts brokers. In response, the airline published a 14-page list stating all of the parts missing from the crashed aircraft. The list included the serial numbers of all of the parts.

In 1997, U.S. District Judge Stanley Marcus ruled that the pilots had committed &quot;willful misconduct&quot;; the ruling applied to American Airlines, which represented the dead pilots. The judge&#x27;s ruling was subsequently reversed in June 1999 by the U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta, which also overturned the jury verdict and declared that the judge in the case was wrong in issuing a finding of fault with the pilots, a role which should have been reserved for the jury only.

American Airlines settled numerous lawsuits brought against it by the families of the victims of the accident. American Airlines filed a &quot;third-party complaint&quot; lawsuit for contribution against Jeppesen and Honeywell, which made the navigation computer database and failed to include the coordinates of Rozo under the identifier &quot;R&quot;; the case went to trial in United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami. At the trial, American Airlines admitted that it bore some legal responsibility for the accident. Honeywell and Jeppesen each contended that they had no legal responsibility for the accident. In June 2000, the jury found that Jeppesen was 30% at fault for the crash, Honeywell was 10% at fault, and American Airlines was 60% at fault.

An enhanced ground proximity warning system (EGPWS) that could have prevented the accident was introduced in 1996.

All U.S. registered turbine-powered aircraft capable of carrying more than six passengers built since 2002 are required to have an advanced terrain awareness warning system.

, American Airlines continues to operate the Miami–Cali route, as American Airlines Flight 919 and American Airlines Flight 921, both operated by aircraft.

==Notable deaths==
* Paris Kanellakis, a computer scientist at Brown University, died with his wife and two children.
* Benny Ramírez, an insurance agent, a former professional wrestler and a former National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) Texas Heavyweight Champion and NWA International Tag Team Championship, whose wrestling career spanned from 1959 to 1983. He, his wife and youngest child were passengers on the flight. He and his wife perished in the crash. Their child was one of the four survivors.

The U.S. government encountered difficulty while trying to distinguish Americans from non-Americans, as many passengers held dual citizenships.

==In popular culture==
* The events of Flight 965 were featured in &quot;Lost&quot;, a season-two (2005) episode of the Canadian TV series &quot;Mayday&quot; (called &quot;Air Emergency&quot; and &quot;Air Disasters&quot; in the U.S. and &quot;Air Crash Investigation&quot; in the UK and elsewhere around the world). The episode was broadcast with the title &quot;Crash on the Mountain&quot; in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Asia.
* The accident was also featured on &quot;Why Planes Crash&quot; on MSNBC, in a 2015 episode titled &quot;Sudden Impact&quot;.
* The 2018 episode &quot;Disastrous Descents&quot; of the TV series &quot;Aircrash Confidential&quot;, produced by WMR Productions and IMG Entertainment, featured the accident.
* A documentary film released in 2021, &quot;American 965&quot;, directed and produced by a former British Airways captain with Fact Not Fiction Films, suggests a different possible cause for the accident.
*&quot;Outlook&quot;, a BBC World Service radio program, had an episode titled &quot;The Father and Daughter Finding Closure After a Plane Crash&quot;, which consisted of interviews with two of the survivors of the crash.
*The accident is featured prominently in the 2011 novel &quot;The Sound of Things Falling&quot; by Colombian author Juan Gabriel Vasquez.

<doc id="417737" wikidata="Q334097" url="?curid=417737" title="Emma Nicholson, Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne">
<text>Emma Harriet Nicholson, Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne (born 16 October 1941) is a British politician, who has been a life peer since 1997. She was elected as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Torridge and West Devon in 1987, before switching to the Liberal Democrats in 1995. She was also the Liberal Democrat Member of the European Parliament for South East England from 1999 to 2009. In 2016, she announced she was rejoining the Conservative Party &quot;with tremendous pleasure&quot;. In 2017, Baroness Nicholson was appointed as Prime Minister&#x27;s Trade Envoy for Kazakhstan.

==Early life==
Born in Oxford and a descendant of the family that founded London gin distillers J&amp;W Nicholson &amp; Co, Lady Nicholson is the third of four daughters of Sir Godfrey Nicholson, Bt and his wife, Lady Katharine (the fifth daughter of the 27th Earl of Crawford). Her uncle was Lord Chancellor in the 1960s, and his daughter, her cousin Eliza Manningham-Buller, became Director General of MI5.

She was diagnosed as deaf at the age of 16. She was educated at St Mary&#x27;s School, Wantage and the Royal Academy of Music.

==Career==
Before her political career, she was a computer programmer and systems analyst from 1962 to 1974, and a director of the Save the Children Foundation from 1974 to 1985.

She unsuccessfully contested the constituency of Blyth in the 1979 general election. She was elected a Conservative Member of Parliament for Torridge and West Devon in 1987, having acted as a vice-chairman of the Conservative Party between 1983 and 1987. She defected to the Liberal Democrats in December 1995, telling Robin Oakley, the BBC&#x27;s Political Editor: &quot;The Conservative Party has changed so much, while my principles have not changed at all. I would argue that it is not so much a case of my leaving the party, but the party leaving me.&quot;

Nicholson fought for the release of Katiza Cebekhulu, the &quot;missing witness&quot; in the case of the death of Stompie Seipei. The South African national had been part of the so-called Mandela United Football Club, the bodyguards of Winnie Mandela. Cebekhulu later claimed that Nicholson had demanded £50,000 from him to obtain copyright over a book she had Fred Bridgland written about him; Nicholson denied this, saying her motives were &quot;exclusively humanitarian and honourable&quot;.

As an MP Nicholson voted for Section 28 which banned schools and local authorities from promoting homosexuality and denounced lesbian families as &quot;neither normal nor natural&quot;. She also voted against an equal age of consent for heterosexuals and homosexuals and her opposition to gay rights led a group called the Lesbian Avengers to organise a &quot;tea party-cum-protest&quot; on her lawn.

She was succeeded by John Burnett, later Baron Burnett, in 1997, when Tony Blair won his landslide. That year, Nicholson was made a life peer as Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, of Winterbourne, in the Royal County of Berkshire.

==European Parliament==
Lady Nicholson became a member of the European Parliament in 1999, joining the Committee on Foreign Affairs and serving as the committee&#x27;s vice-president from 2004 to 2007. She was President of the Delegation for Relations with Iraq and President of the Committee on Women&#x27;s Rights of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly. Lady Nicholson was also a member of the subcommittee on Human Rights, the Delegation for relations with Iran and the Delegation for relations with the Mashreq countries (i.e. the eastern Arab world). She was Rapporteur for Kashmir, and in 2007 her controversial report on Kashmir was passed by a majority of 522 to 9.

During the Iraq War, Nicholson gave evidence to the United Nations that she claimed showed Iraq had &quot;hidden material used to make weapons of mass destruction&quot;. She described the draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes as a &quot;genocide&quot;.

She has monitored elections in many countries. In 2006, Lady Nicholson was Chief Observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission to Yemen. She was a member of European Union Election Observation Missions to Palestine (2005), Azerbaijan (2005), Lebanon (2005), Afghanistan (2005), Armenia (2007) and Pakistan (2008). In January and December 2005 she was a member of the United Nations Election Observation Missions to Iraq.

She also generated controversy through her strong opposition to international adoptions, which she believed had become a market and subject to corruption. While the European Parliament&#x27;s Special Rapporteur for Romania&#x27;s EU accession she and some others in the international community criticised international adoptions. Due partially to her pressure, the Romanian government in 2005 implemented legislation that &quot;de facto&quot; banned the practice, in line with practices in some of the EU member states. The measure generated controversy, mainly in the US, Israel, France, Spain and Italy, particularly from prospective parents. International and Romanian media also called attention to poor conditions in Romanian orphanages and hospitals where abandoned children remained for prolonged periods, while acknowledging some progress made in reforming child protection. In December 2005 and July 2006, the EP passed measures requesting Romania deal with outstanding pipeline cases, despite Romania having dismissed these formally through legislation after consultation with an Independent Panel of EU Experts on Family Law. Critics claimed that this panel was stacked with opponents of international adoptions. The U.S. Congress also passed repeated measures and held hearings opposing the ban.

Lady Nicholson stood down from the European Parliament at the 2009 elections.

==House of Lords==
In 2009, Lady Nicholson returned to London and resumed her political work at the House of Lords. In February 2010, she founded the All-party parliamentary group (APPG) for Business Development in Iraq and the Regions and has served as its chair. She is also a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Human Trafficking, chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Foreign Affairs and speaks regularly on health care and education in the Middle East and Eastern Europe and business development in Iraq and its wider neighbourhood. In 2013 she argued that the Iraq War was &quot;resoundingly&quot; worth it, and claiming Liberal Democrat party members who took an opposing stance were &quot;guilty of hypocrisy&quot;. She was appointed as Prime Minister&#x27;s Trade Envoy for Iraq on 30 January 2014.

She resigned the Liberal Democrat whip in July 2016, to sit as a non-affiliated member. However, on 10 September 2016, she announced she was re-joining the Conservative Party &quot;with tremendous pleasure&quot; and would sit on the Conservative benches in the House of Lords. Listing her reasons for rejoining the Tories, she highlighted Theresa May&#x27;s education speech on 9 September, quoting May&#x27;s position on grammar schools as evidence that the prime minister &quot;leads a party with a real commitment to delivering for the next generation and building a country that works for everyone&quot;. However, the Liberal Democrats claimed that she had said her reason for leaving the party was her position on Europe.

Baroness Nicholson visited Kazakhstan as Prime Minister&#x27;s Trade Envoy on 28 April 2019. The six-day visit was focused on expanding trade relations with the Central Asian country.

She voted against gay marriage on the grounds it would degrade &quot;the status of women and of girls&quot;.

She is a supporter of the LGB Alliance and the group has thanked for her &quot;unwavering support&quot;.

==Other work==
Lady Nicholson is the Executive Chairman of the AMAR Foundation, which works to rebuild and improve the lives of disadvantaged communities in war-torn areas.

She is Executive Chairman of the Iraq Britain Business Council an organisation that facilitates business, trade investment, human resources, training and transfer of technology and know-how into the Republic of Iraq.

Lady Nicholson is Executive Chairman of the Associatia Children&#x27;s High Level Group. She co-founded its English counterpart, the Children&#x27;s High Level Group (now the charity Lumos, &quot;working to end the harm of institutionalisation &amp; help children worldwide be reunited with family&quot;) with novelist and philanthropist J. K. Rowling. Lady Nicholson is the co-chairman with the Prime Minister of Romania of the High Level Group for Romania&#x27;s Children and the co-chairman with the Prime Minister of Moldova of the High Level Group for Moldovan Children.

Lady Nicholson is also a member of the American Bar Association&#x27;s Middle East North Africa Council, the Arab Gulf Programme for United Nations Development Organisations Prize Committee and Freedom House International Solidarity Committee. She is a board member of the Foundation for Dialogue Among Civilisations, the American Islamic Congress, and a member of the Board of Advisors for the New York University Center for Dialogues, Islamic World. She is vice-president of The Little Foundation, and is Honorary Advisor to the Prime Minister and Government of Iraq on Public Health and related issues.

Nicholson was a Trustee of the Booker Prize until 2009, after which she was made an honorary vice-president. In June 2020, Nicholson referred to model Munroe Bergdorf on Twitter as &quot;a weird creature&quot; and shared posts Bergdorf considered transphobic, resulting in an official complaint to the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner. This led to criticism of Booker from writers including Damian Barr, Marlon James and Sarah Perry. Booker subsequently announced that they would be dissolving all honorary titles and roles associated with the event.

==Personal life==
On 9 May 1987, Nicholson married Sir Michael Harris Caine, with whom she had a foster son Amar Kanim, who was rescued from Iraq after surviving a napalm attack in March 1991. She set up the Amar Foundation to support projects in Iraq. She is President of the Council of the Caine Prize for African Writing, which was named after her late husband.

Nicholson was widowed in 1999 and alleged negligence by hospital staff treating her husband at King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital. Nicholson claims that nurses at the King Edward VII refused to call consultants and doctors despite her husband&#x27;s distress when a breathing tube could not be cleared. In September 1999 &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Baroness Nicholson was due to pursue legal action against the hospital alleging negligence. In light of her husband&#x27;s death, Baroness Nicholson said:

==Awards and honours==
In 2017, Lady Nicholson received an honorary doctorate in International Leadership and Humanitarian Service from Brigham Young University in the United States for her charity and humanitarian work across the Middle East.

<text>Pauline Diana Baynes (9 September 1922 – 1 August 2008) was an English illustrator, author, and commercial artist. She contributed drawings and paintings to more than 200 books, mostly in the children&#x27;s genre. She was the first illustrator of some of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s minor works, including &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot;, &quot;Smith of Wootton Major&quot;, and &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;. She became well-known for her cover illustrations for &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and for her poster map with inset illustrations, &quot;A Map of Middle-earth&quot;. She illustrated all seven volumes of C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, from the first book, &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;. Gaining a reputation as the &quot;Narnia artist&quot;, she illustratred spinoffs like Brian Sibley&#x27;s &quot;The Land of Narnia&quot;. In addition to work for other authors, including illustrating Roger Lancelyn Green&#x27;s &quot;The Tales of Troy&quot; and Iona and Peter Opie&#x27;s books of nursery rhymes, Baynes created some 600 illustrations for Grant Uden&#x27;s &quot;A Dictionary of Chivalry&quot;, for which she won the Kate Greenaway Medal. Late in her life she began to write and illustrate her own books, with animal or Biblical themes.

== Early life ==

Baynes was born on 9 September 1922 at 67 Brunswick Place, Hove, East Sussex, England. Her father was Frederick William Wilberforce Baynes (1887–1967) and her mother was Jessie Harriet Maude Baynes, née Cunningham (). Her only sibling was her elder sister, Angela Mary Baynes. While she was still a baby, her family emigrated to India, where her father had been appointed a Commissioner (district official) in the British imperial Indian Civil Service, serving as a senior magistrate. The Bayneses divided their time between the city of Agra and a refuge from the midsummer heat in the hill town of Mussoorie; Baynes was happy in her expatriate infancy.

When she was five, her mother, who was in poor health, took both her daughters back to England. Baynes recalled crying herself to sleep on her journey home. The three returnees lived a nomadic life in Surrey, lodging with various friends and renting a series of rooms in boarding houses. Baynes&#x27;s father stayed behind in India, licensed by his wife to feel &quot;free to do as he pleased&quot;, but regularly rejoined his family for holidays in Switzerland.

== Education ==

Baynes began her education at a convent school, where the nuns who taught her mocked her fantastical imagination, her homemade clothes and her ability to speak Hindi. Her unhappiness over their bullying was slightly mitigated when she learned that Rudyard Kipling, whom she admired, had experienced something similar. When she was nine, she was sent to Beaufort School, an independent girls&#x27; boarding establishment, in Camberley. Her favourite subject there was art, &quot;because it was easy&quot;. By the time that she left, she had formed the ambition of becoming an illustrator. She liked Beaufort well enough to go back to it as a teacher for two years in her mid-twenties.
At fifteen, she followed her sister to the Farnham School of Art (now subsumed into the University for the Creative Arts). She spent two terms studying design, which was to become the foundation of her mature technique.

At nineteen, again like her sister, she won a place at the Slade School of Fine Art, just as it left its usual premises on the Gower Street campus of University College London to begin a period of wartime cohabitation with the Ruskin School of Drawing in Oxford University. Studying the work of the illustrators Gustave Doré, Edmund Dulac, Arthur Rackham, Ernest Shepard, R. S. Sherriffs, Rex Whistler, Jacques-Marie-Gaston Onfroy de Bréville (&quot;Job&quot;) and the anonymous illuminators of mediaeval manuscripts, she became certain that she had a vocation to follow in their footsteps. She was not a diligent student, spending time on &quot;coffee and parties&quot;, and she left the Slade without a qualification. She did, however, achieve the distinction, one shared with her sister, of exhibiting at the Royal Academy of Arts, in 1939.

== War work and early career ==

In 1940, a year into World War II, both Baynes sisters joined the Women&#x27;s Voluntary Service. The WVS sent them to the Camouflage Development Training Centre that the Royal Engineers had set up in Farnham Castle, where the sisters were put to work making models to be used as teaching aids. One of their colleagues at the centre was Powell Perry, whose family owned a company that published picture books for children. It was Perry who gave Baynes her first professional commissions. Among the Perry Colour Books to which she contributed were &quot;Question Mark&quot;, &quot;Wild Flower Rhymes&quot; and a novelization of the libretto of Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;.

From 1942 until the end of the war, the Baynes sisters worked in the Admiralty Hydrographic Department in Bath, making maps and marine charts for the Royal Navy. This experience stood Baynes in good stead in later life, when she created maps of C. S. Lewis&#x27;s Narnia and J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth. A letter that she wrote to a friend at this time included a sketch that he passed on to Frank Whittaker, an employee of Country Life. Her friend&#x27;s kindness resulted in commissions from the magazine to illustrate three books of fairy stories by Victoria Stevenson.

== Illustrating J. R. R. Tolkien ==

=== &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; ===

In 1948, after briefly teaching at Beaufort, Baynes sought to develop her career by writing a book of her own – &quot;Victoria and the Golden Bird&quot;, a fantasy about a girl&#x27;s magical visits to far-off countries – and by trying to secure work from a major London publisher. She sent Allen &amp; Unwin a suite of comic reinterpretations of marginalia from the mediaeval Luttrell Psalter. J. R. R. Tolkien, author of Allen &amp; Unwin&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, had recently offered the firm a mock-medieval comic novella called &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot;. They had commissioned illustrations for the story from Milein Cosman, which Tolkien had disliked. On 5 August 1948, he complained to Ronald Eames, the publisher&#x27;s art director, that they were &quot;wholly out of keeping with the style or manner of the text&quot;. Five days later, Eames wrote to Baynes requesting specimen drawings for &quot;an adult fairy story (complete with dragon and giant!)&quot; that would require &quot;some historical and topographical (Oxford and Wales) realism&quot;. Baynes reassured Eames that she knew Oxford from having sketched there, and knew Wales from having picked Welsh potatoes. Visiting Allen &amp; Unwin&#x27;s offices to see what Baynes had produced for him, Tolkien was won over to her cause by the images. &quot;They are more than illustrations&quot;, he wrote to Allen &amp; Unwin on 16 March 1949, &quot;they are a collateral theme. I showed them to my friends whose polite comment was that they reduced my text to a commentary on the drawings.&quot;

Tolkien was so pleased that on 20 December 1949, he wrote to her expressing the wish that she would one day illustrate two other books that he was working on – the tales that eventually became &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. Tolkien&#x27;s publishers thought differently, preferring to have his books illustrated by Alan Lee, Francis Mosley, Ted Nasmith and Margrethe II of Denmark. Ultimately, Tolkien decided that Baynes was not the right artist to illustrate his major works, judging that they needed pictures &quot;more noble or awe-inspiring&quot; than she could produce.

=== &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot; ===

In 1961 Tolkien turned to Baynes again when he was compiling an anthology of some of his shorter pieces of verse. &quot;You seem able to produce wonderful pictures with a touch of &#x27;fantasy&#x27;&quot;, he wrote on 6 December, &quot;but primarily bright and clear visions of things that one might actually see&quot;. &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;, featuring some of Baynes&#x27;s most delicate and meticulous imagery, was published in 1962. Baynes told Tolkien that her favourite among the book&#x27;s poems was &quot;The Hoard&quot;; only much later did she learn that her illustration for that particular poem had disappointed him – she had drawn a dragon facing away from the mouth of its cave and a knight without either a shield or a helmet, which he had thought looked implausible. He would also have preferred Tom Bombadil to have been shown on the front of the book rather than on the back, a wish which HarperCollins eventually granted when the book was reprinted in a pocket edition in 2014.

=== Cover art for &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; ===

In 1961 Puffin used a painting by Baynes for the cover of a paperback edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Three years later, Allen &amp; Unwin published &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in a three-volume deluxe hardback edition for which they asked Baynes to design a slipcase. Never having read the story, Baynes was faced with the prospect of having to read a thousand pages of narrative before picking up a brush. Her sister, who knew the book well, rescued her from her predicament by painting a panorama of Tolkien&#x27;s characters and locales that Baynes was able to borrow from. The triptych that Baynes created became one of the most widely reproduced of all her paintings, being recycled for the iconic cover art of a one-volume paperback edition of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in 1968 and a three-volume Unwin Paperbacks version in 1981. Baynes also created an image of Aragorn&#x27;s standard that was used to promote &quot;The Return of the King&quot; in a newspaper advertisement in October 1955.

=== &quot;Smith of Wootton Major&quot; ===

In 1967 Baynes illustrated the last piece of Tolkien&#x27;s fiction to be published in his lifetime, his allegorical short story &quot;Smith of Wootton Major&quot;. Ballantine&#x27;s American edition of the book was issued with an alternative Baynes cover. Yet another cover appeared when the book was reissued in the United Kingdom in 1975 in a second edition that was uniform with &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;. Her illustrations were also used in an edition published in 2005 that was edited by Verlyn Flieger and included additional material written by scholars of Tolkien&#x27;s work.

=== Maps of Middle-earth ===

In 1969, while waiting for Tolkien to finish &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, Allen &amp; Unwin commissioned Baynes to paint a map of his Middle-earth. Tolkien supplied her with copies of the several, variously scaled graph paper charts that he had made in the course of writing &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and annotated her copy of the map that his son Christopher had produced for &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; in 1954. Her working &quot;Fellowship&quot; map, scribbled over with new place names and some barely legible notes on latitudes, ships, trees, horses, elephants and camels, was bought by Oxford&#x27;s Bodleian Library in 2016 for roughly £60,000. 

With the help of cartographers from the Bordon military camp in Hampshire, Baynes created &quot;A Map of Middle-earth&quot; that Allen &amp; Unwin published as a poster in 1970. It was decorated with a header and footer showing some of Tolkien&#x27;s characters, and with vignettes of some of the places described in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Tolkien wrote that her ideas of the Teeth of Mordor, the Argonath, Barad-dûr and, especially, Minas Morgul were very similar to his own, although he was less happy with her images of his heroes and their enemies. A companion map for &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, entitled &quot;There and Back Again: a Map of Bilbo&#x27;s Journey Through Eriador and Rhovanion&quot;, was published by Allen &amp; Unwin in 1971. Both maps became famous.

=== &quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Last Song&quot; ===

In 1974, a year after Tolkien&#x27;s death, Allen &amp; Unwin published his poem &quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Last Song&quot; as Baynes&#x27;s third and final Tolkien poster. Her painting showed a scene that Tolkien described in the closing pages of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;: Sam, Merry and Pippin stand at the Grey Havens, watching an elvish ship carrying Frodo, Bilbo, Elrond, Galadriel and Gandalf away from Middle-earth to the land of Aman. In 1990, the poem was reissued as a book with three parallel sequences of Baynes&#x27;s paintings: one illustrating Bilbo&#x27;s journey from Rivendell to the Undying Lands, one showing Bilbo in various states of repose, and one depicting the events narrated in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Some of the illustrations were omitted when the book was reissued by other publishers twelve years later.

=== Other works ===

In 1978 Baynes painted a cover for a paperback edition of Tolkien&#x27;s translations of &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, &quot;Pearl&quot; and &quot;Sir Orfeo&quot;.
In 1980 Allen &amp; Unwin published &quot;Poems and Stories&quot;, a de luxe, boxed, single-volume anthology of several of Tolkien&#x27;s shorter works. The book featured new illustrations by Baynes for the short story &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot;, the verse drama &quot;The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm&#x27;s Son&quot;, &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot; and &quot;Smith of Wootton Major&quot;. It also included all of Baynes&#x27;s original illustrations for the latter three titles, some revised with grey and orange tinting. Baynes used the opportunity provided by revisiting &quot;Tom Bombadil&quot; to rework her illustration for &quot;The Hoard&quot; to make its dragon and knight look the way Tolkien had wanted them to.

In 1999, half a century after her collaboration with Tolkien had begun, Baynes returned to &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; once again to add a map of the story&#x27;s Little Kingdom. The book was published with the revised cover that Baynes had painted for its second edition in 1976. It was reissued with a modified version of this cover when it was published in a pocket-sized edition in 2014. Baynes&#x27;s final Tolkien art was published in 2003, when an audiobook of &quot;Smith of Wootton Major&quot; and &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot; was issued with a CD insert showing an image of Niggle painting his Great Tree that had been commissioned from Baynes in the 1970s but had remained unpublished.

== Illustrating C. S. Lewis ==

=== &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; ===

When C. S. Lewis was sixteen, he conceived the idea of a faun walking through a snowy forest carrying an umbrella and some parcels. In 1949, after ten years of false starts, he finally completed a story about the country where the faun lived – the land of Narnia, where it was always winter but never Christmas. A close friend of Tolkien&#x27;s, Lewis chose Baynes to illustrate his tale after enjoying her artwork for &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot;, encouraged also by a bookshop assistant. Baynes signed a contract with Lewis&#x27;s publisher, Geoffrey Bles, in 1949, and delivered drawings, a coloured frontispiece and a cover design for the book the following year. &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; was published in 1950. At Lewis&#x27;s request, Baynes went on to illustrate all six of the book&#x27;s sequels – &quot;Prince Caspian: the Return to Narnia&quot; (1951), &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; (1952), &quot;The Silver Chair&quot; (1953), &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; (1954), &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; (1955) and &quot;The Last Battle&quot; (1956). Too unworldly to negotiate the royalties deal that would have made her a multi-millionaire, Baynes sold her work to Lewis&#x27;s publishers for a flat fee of just £100 per book. Lewis commented that her work had done much to make the Narnia books popular and she became increasingly linked to the series and known as the &quot;Narnia artist&quot;, a title she retained for much of her career.

Baynes revisited &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; several times. When the books were issued as Puffin paperbacks between 1959 and 1965, Baynes created new covers for them, and slipcase artwork. In the 1970s, she created a third set of covers for hardback editions by The Bodley Head and Collins. In 1991, HarperCollins published a special edition of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; with seventeen new paintings, and in 1998 they commemorated the centenary of Lewis&#x27;s birth by reissuing the complete &quot;Chronicles&quot; with all Baynes&#x27;s line illustrations tinted by her in watercolour. In 2000, HarperCollins published a 50th anniversary edition of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; including all Baynes&#x27;s illustrations and her 1968 colour poster map of Narnia.

=== C. S. Lewis on Baynes ===

Lewis met Baynes only three times – at his publisher&#x27;s office, at a lunch party at Magdalen College in 1949 and at the Charing Cross Hotel in London in 1951. He found her &quot;good and beautiful and sensitive&quot;. In his letters to Baynes, he praised her effusively. Her drawings were &quot;really excellent&quot; with a &quot;wealth of vigorous detail&quot;. She did &quot;each book a little bit better than the last&quot;. When she congratulated him on winning the Carnegie literary award for &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, he replied &quot;is it not really &#x27;our&#x27; Medal? I&#x27;m sure the illustrations were taken into consideration as well as the text.&quot; Sometimes, though, he was frank about her technical limitations. &quot;If only you cd. take 6 months off and devote them to anatomy, there&#x27;s no limit to your possibilities&quot;, he wrote. 

According to Lewis, she had &quot;Magna virtutes nec minora vitia&quot; – great virtues, but vices no less great. He felt that the faces of her children were often &quot;empty, expressionless and too alike&quot;, and that she couldn&#x27;t draw lions. Indeed, &quot;In quadrupeds &quot;claudicat&quot;&quot; (she limps); he wrote that she would profit from a visit to a zoo. He noted that a knight was wearing his shield on his right arm instead of his left. &quot;What&quot;, he asked I. O. Evans, &quot;is one to do with illustrators – especially if, like, mine, they are timid, shrinking young women who, when criticized, look as if you&#x27;d pulled their hair or given them a black eye? My resolution was exhausted by the time I&#x27;d convinced her that rowers face aft not (as she thinks) forward.&quot;

Lewis told his friend Dorothy L. Sayers that &quot;The main trouble about Pauline B. is ... her total ignorance of animal anatomy. In the v. last book she has at last learned how to draw a horse. I have always had serious reservations about her ... But she had merits (her botanical forms are lovely), she needed the work (old mother to support, I think), and worst of all she is such a timid creature, so &#x27;easily put down&#x27; that criticism cd. only be hinted ... At any &quot;real&quot; reprimand she&#x27;d have thrown up the job, not in a huff but in sheer, downright, unresenting, pusillanimous dejection. She is quite a good artist on a certain formal-fantastic level (did Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Farmer Giles&quot; far better than my books) but has no interest in matter – how boats are rowed, or bows shot with, or feet planted, or fists clenched. Arabesque [decoration] is really her vocation.&quot; Sayers in turn was scathing about Baynes&#x27;s work.

=== Baynes on C. S. Lewis ===

Lewis made little impression on Baynes in their meetings. They corresponded little; she found him &quot;kindly and tolerant&quot;, charming and polite. In 1962, she sent him an aptly Narnian Christmas present; he replied that he appreciated her &quot;enduring White Witch even more than the transitory joys of the Turkish Delight.&quot; Much later, she learnt from a 1988 biography of Lewis that he had complained about her behind her back. &quot;One doesn&#x27;t need to have liked him to admire him&quot;, she told her confidante Charlotte Cory. &quot;He never became a friend.&quot; Baynes&#x27;s feelings about Lewis&#x27;s books were conflicted too. She thought his stories &quot;marvellous&quot;, but, even though she was a Christian, she was uncomfortable with their Christian subtext. She claimed not to have identified the lion Aslan with Christ until after she had finished work on &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, despite having drawn him standing upright like a man in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;. She regretted that her Narnian art had overshadowed the rest of her work and she was ruefully aware that a book collector would pay more for a first edition of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; than she had been paid for illustrating it.

== Other artwork ==

Baynes contributed to Narnia spinoffs. Brian Sibley&#x27;s &quot;The Land of Narnia&quot;, including many new paintings and drawings, appeared in 1989. In 1994, James Riordan&#x27;s &quot;A Book of Narnians&quot; provided a portrait gallery of Narnia&#x27;s &quot;dramatis personae&quot;. Among others of Baynes&#x27;s Lewisiana were Douglas Gresham&#x27;s &quot;The Official Narnia Cookbook&quot;, &quot;The Magical Land of Narnia Puzzle Book&quot;, Sibley and Alison Sage&#x27;s &quot;A Treasury of Narnians&quot;, &quot;The Narnia Trivia Book&quot;, &quot;The Wisdom of Narnia&quot; and &quot;Narnia Chronology&quot;.

The illustrations of which Baynes was most proud were the almost six hundred that she created for Grant Uden&#x27;s &quot;A Dictionary of Chivalry&quot;, on which she laboured for nearly two years. They won her the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals&#x27; Kate Greenaway Medal for the best book illustrations of 1968. In 1972, Baynes achieved a runner-up&#x27;s commendation in the Greenaway competition with her illustrations for Helen Piers&#x27;s &quot;Snail and Caterpillar&quot;. Among the other books in her bibliography are works by Richard Adams, Hans Christian Andersen, Enid Blyton, Rumer Godden, Roger Lancelyn Green, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, Rudyard Kipling, George MacDonald, Mary Norton, her friends Iona and Peter Opie, Beatrix Potter, Arthur Ransome, Alison Uttley and Amabel Williams-Ellis. Several of her commissions were the result of the bond that she formed with Puffin Books&#x27; Kaye Webb. Baynes contributed artwork to many magazines, including &quot;Holly Leaves&quot;, &quot;Lilliput&quot;, &quot;Puffin Post&quot;, &quot;The Sphere&quot;, &quot;The Tatler&quot; and &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;; she had been introduced to &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; by another of its artists, her friend and mentor Ernest Shepard. Stationery companies commissioned her to design Christmas cards – some of which are still reproduced decades after she painted them – and Huntley and Palmers employed her to advertise their biscuits. The Church of the Good Shepherd in her home village of Dockenfield has a pair of Baynes&#x27;s stained glass windows. For the Plymouth Congregational Church in Minneapolis, Baynes designed the world&#x27;s largest pieces of crewel embroidery.

== As author ==

In Baynes&#x27;s later years commissions could be hard to come by - there were days when fan mail and a rejection letter would arrive in the same post. Baynes used her fallow periods to put together some books of her own. Several came from her delight in animals – &quot;The Elephant&#x27;s Ball&quot; (based on a nineteenth-century narrative poem), &quot;How Dog Began&quot; (a Kiplingesque fable dedicated to eleven of her own pets) and &quot;Questionable Creatures&quot; (a pseudo-mediaeval, cryptozoological fantasia that only found an American publisher when Baynes agreed to paint out a mermaid&#x27;s breasts). But most of Baynes&#x27;s books were the fruit of her abiding interest in religion. &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot; celebrated the famous Christmas carol; &quot;The Song of the Three Holy Children&quot; illustrated an apocryphal passage from the Book of Daniel; &quot;Noah and the Ark&quot; and &quot;In the Beginning&quot; were drawn from the Book of Genesis; &quot;Thanks Be to God&quot; was an international anthology of prayers; &quot;How excellent is thy name!&quot; illustrated Psalm 8; and &quot;I Believe&quot; illustrated the Nicene Creed.

== Personal life ==

When Baynes&#x27;s father retired he left India and returned to England, settling with Baynes&#x27;s mother in a house close to Baynes&#x27;s own near Farnham in southwest Surrey. Long estranged, they maintained a pretence of marriage, but lived lives that were essentially separate. A mistress with whom Baynes&#x27;s father had established a relationship in India followed him to Surrey and set up home nearby. Baynes looked after both her parents loyally, even when the burden of caring for them became so great that she could do her illustrating only in the small hours of the night.

In 1961, after many &quot;interesting and highly enjoyable&quot; but evanescent love affairs, Baynes answered a knock on her door from an itinerant dog&#x27;s meat salesman. He was Friedrich Otto Gasch, usually known as Fritz. Born on 21 September 1919 in Auerswalde, Saxony, Germany, Gasch had served in Erwin Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps during the Second World War, had been taken prisoner and had then been sent via the United States to an English PoW camp. Once the war had ended he had decided to adopt England as his home. A whirlwind courtship culminated in Baynes&#x27;s and Gasch&#x27;s marrying on 18 March 1961. &quot;Meeting Fritz&quot;, Baynes said, &quot;was the best thing that ever happened to me; he was a splendid man and a wonderful husband who was completely tolerant of his wife&#x27;s obsession to draw!&quot; The Gasches lived in Rock Barn Cottage, Heath Hill, Dockenfield, in the North Downs. Their only child, a son, was stillborn. After retiring from work as a contract gardener, Gasch died on 28 October 1988 at the age of sixty-nine.

Two years after her husband died Baynes was contacted by Karin Gasch (born 1942), a daughter of Gasch&#x27;s by an earlier marriage. Baynes took on the role of a Gasch family member. &quot;It was&quot;, she said, &quot;like something magical coming back at me through a wardrobe.&quot;
Baynes became a friend of the Tolkien scholars Wayne G. Hammond, David Henshaw, Christina Scull and Brian Sibley. Baynes was also close to Tolkien, whose Christianity she approved of as &quot;more rooted and unobtrusive&quot; than Lewis&#x27;s. After Tolkien and his wife had retired to Bournemouth, Baynes and Gasch used to visit them and join them for holidays.

== Death and legacy ==

Baynes died in Dockenfield on 1 August 2008, leaving behind unpublished illustrations for &quot;The Quran&quot;, &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; and Sibley&#x27;s &quot;Osric the Extraordinary Owl&quot;: this last was printed thirteen years later. She bequeathed her archive of several hundred drawings and paintings, her library of more than two thousand books, and her intellectual property rights to the Oxford Programme of Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts, with a request that her collection should be housed in the college&#x27;s Chapin Library of Rare Books. There is a second, small Baynes archive at the University of Oregon. Sibley, writing in &quot;The Independent&quot;, summed up the style of his friend thus: 

Baynes&#x27;s standing in the pantheon of children&#x27;s book illustrators is high, her drawings and paintings changing hands for thousands of pounds sterling. Most of the art that she created for Tolkien&#x27;s and Lewis&#x27;s books has remained continuously in print ever since it was first published. As of 1998, the Narnia stories alone had sold more than one hundred million copies. Baynes&#x27;s paintings of Narnia have gained still wider currency through their use in featurettes in-home media releases of Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; movies. Looking back after half a century, Baynes&#x27;s verdict on her momentous trip through the back of a wardrobe was down to earth. &quot;I just thought of it as work.&quot; In their &quot;In Memoriam&quot; for Baynes in the &quot;Mythlore&quot; Inklings journal, Hammond and Scull stated that

<text>A flight engineer (FE), also sometimes called an air engineer, is the member of an aircraft&#x27;s flight crew who monitors and operates its complex aircraft systems. In the early era of aviation, the position was sometimes referred to as the &quot;air mechanic&quot;. Flight engineers can still be found on some larger fixed-wing airplanes and helicopters. A similar crew position exists on some spacecraft. In most modern aircraft, their complex systems are both monitored and adjusted by electronic microprocessors and computers, resulting in the elimination of the flight engineer&#x27;s position.

In earlier days, most larger aircraft were designed and built with a flight engineer&#x27;s position. For U.S. civilian aircraft that require a flight engineer as part of the crew, the flight engineer must possess an FAA Flight Engineer Certificate with reciprocating, turboprop, or turbojet ratings appropriate to the aircraft. Whereas the four-engine Douglas DC-4 did not require a flight engineer, the FAA type certificates of subsequent four-engine reciprocating engine airplanes (Boeing 307 and 377, DC-6, DC-7, Constellation) and early two-, three- and four-engine jets (Boeing 707, 727, early 747s, DC-8, DC-10, L-1011, early A300s) required them. Smaller twinjets (DC-9, 737, BAC 1-11, Caravelle, Dassault Mercure) were never complex enough to require a flight engineer, while later large two, three, and four-engine jets (Airbus A310, A300-600, Boeing 767, MD-11, 747-400, and later) were designed with sufficient automation as to eliminate the need for the position.

== History ==
In order to dedicate a person to monitor an aircraft&#x27;s engines and its other critical flight systems, the position of &quot;flight engineer&quot; (FE) was created. The FE did not actually fly the airplane; instead, the FE&#x27;s position had a specialized control panel allowing for the monitoring and control of various aircraft systems. The FE is therefore an integrated member of the flight deck crew who works in close coordination with the two pilots during all phases of flight.

Traditionally, the FE station has been usually placed on the main flight deck just aft of the pilot and copilot, and close to the navigator. Earlier referred to as a &quot;flight mechanic&quot; on the four-engine commercial seaplanes like the Sikorsky S-42, Martin M-130 and the Boeing 314 Clipper, the FE&#x27;s role was referred to as an &quot;engineer&quot; (much like a ship&#x27;s engineer) on the first very large flying boat, the Dornier Do X. On the Do X the FE operated a large and complex engineering station similar to later large transport aircraft to monitor the twelve engines.

The first US military aircraft to include a FE was the Consolidated PBY which was introduced into naval service in 1936. The FE panel was located in the pylon between the fuselage and the wing. The FE did not have ignition, throttle and propeller controls, thus a person in the cockpit was also required to start the engines.

During the war the Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax bombers employed FEs, as these large aircraft employed only a single pilot. The first Allied military operation during the Second World War involving FEs occurred in February 1941 with a Short Stirling; it was the first four-engined bomber-raid of the war by the RAF.

== Duties ==
The flight engineer (&quot;air engineer&quot; in the Royal Air Force) is primarily concerned with the operation and monitoring of all aircraft systems, and is required to diagnose, and where possible rectify or eliminate, any faults that may arise. On most multi-engine airplanes, the FE sets and adjusts engine power during takeoff, climb, cruise, go-arounds, or at any time the pilot flying requests a specific power setting to be set during the approach phase. The FE sets and monitors major systems, including fuel, pressurization and air conditioning, hydraulic, electrics (engine driven generators, auxiliary power units), gas turbine compressor/air turbine motor (APU, GTC, ATM), ice and rain protection (engine and nacelle anti-ice, window heat, probe heater), oxygen, fire and overheat protection of all systems, liquid cooling system, draw through cooling system, forced air cooling system, and powered flying controls.

FEs are also responsible for preflight and postflight aircraft inspections, and ensuring that the weight and balance of the aircraft is correctly calculated to ensure the centre of gravity is within limits. On airplanes where the FE&#x27;s station is located on the same flight deck just aft of the two pilots (all western three- and four-man deck airplanes), they also monitor an aircraft&#x27;s flight path, speed, and altitude. A significant portion of their time is spent cross checking pilot selections. The FE is the systems expert of the airplane with an extensive mechanical and technical knowledge of aircraft systems and aircraft performance. On some military airplanes (Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, Boeing E-3 Sentry, McDonnell Douglas KC-10) the FE sits behind the co-pilot in the cockpit, facing outboard to operate a panel of switches, gauges and indicators or forward to operate throttles, lighting controls, flight controls. On the Tupolev Tu-134 the FE sits in the nose of the aircraft. On other western military airplanes, such as on the Lockheed P-3 Orion and Lockheed C-130H Hercules, FEs sit between, slightly aft of (and, in the case of the C-130A-H models, slightly higher than) the pilots. On the P-3 Orion, E-6B Mercury and E-3 Sentry the FE is responsible for starting and shutting down engines at the start and end of each flight, and also during in-flight shutdowns which are carried out to save fuel on long range operations. In some militaries, the aircraft&#x27;s FE is also authorised to make and certify repairs to the aircraft when it is away from its base. This can eliminate the need for technical repair crews to accompany the aircraft on short deployments.

On civilian airplanes the FE is positioned so that they can monitor the forward instruments, pilot selections and adjust the thrust levers located on the centre pedestal; the FE&#x27;s chair can travel forward and aft and it can swivel laterally 90 degrees, which enables them to face forward and set the engine power, then move aft and rotate sideways to monitor and set the systems panel. The FE is the aircraft systems expert onboard and responsible for troubleshooting and suggesting solutions to in-flight emergencies and abnormal technical conditions, as well as computing takeoff and landing data. The FE&#x27;s seat on modern aircraft has a complete range of motion (side to side, forward to aft, swivel, up and down) to accommodate the many positions required to monitor and operate the aircraft systems.

The basic philosophy of a three-person flight deck in many flight operations, should an abnormality or emergency arise, is for the captain to hand over the actual flying of the aircraft to the first officer (co-pilot). The captain and FE together review and carry out the necessary actions required to contain and rectify the problem. This spreads the workload and ensures a system of cross-checking which maximizes safety. The captain is the manager and decision maker (pilot not flying, PNF), the first officer, or co-pilot, is the actual flier of the aircraft (pilot flying, PF), and the FE reads the check-lists and executes actions required under the auspices of the captain. There can be occasions when the roles of the pilots during an emergency are reversed, i.e. the copilot becomes the PNF and the captain becomes the PF; one such example was on the A300 B-Series aircraft when there was a complete loss of generator-supplied electrical power, whereupon the standby instruments that were powered were on the captain&#x27;s side only, requiring the captain to be PF and the PNF and FE to resolve the issue.

During World War II many U.S. bomber aircraft incorporated a flight engineer&#x27;s position. However, this position also doubled as a gunner, usually operating the upper turret, as was the case of the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. On some commercial airliners with a flight engineer, the FE is the third in command, after the captain and first officer.

== Regulation ==
Unlike commercial pilots, the Federal Aviation Administration never set a mandatory retirement age for flight engineers. As a result, some pilots would voluntarily downgrade themselves when turning 60. This policy was the subject of two U.S. Supreme Court cases in 1985, when it ruled against Western Airlines that forced retirement of flight engineers based on the regulations for pilots was a violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. Earlier in the year it had rejected a policy that prevented pilots from &quot;bumping&quot; flight engineers from their positions upon the former reaching retirement age.

== Elimination ==
Starting in the 1980s, the development of powerful and small integrated circuits and other advances in computers and digital technology eliminated the need for flight engineers on airliners and many modern military aircraft.

On two-pilot flight deck airplanes, sensors and computers monitor and adjust systems automatically. There is no onboard technical expert and third pair of eyes. If a malfunction, abnormality or emergency occurs, it is displayed on an electronic display panel. One pilot does the flying while the other pilot starts reading and executing the quick reference handbook (QRH) to resolve the problem. Modern technological advancements in today&#x27;s aircraft have reduced the dependence upon human control over systems.

The most recent aircraft built with FE stations include military variants of the Boeing 707, such as the E-3 Sentry and E-6 Mercury, both built through 1991, the Tupolev Tu-154, the final example of which was delivered in 2013, and the Scaled Composites Stratolaunch whose sole example first flew in 2019. The last major US passenger airline to fly aircraft equipped with a flight engineer&#x27;s station was Northwest Airlines, who retired their final 747-200s from charter service in 2009. The final major cargo operator to employ flight engineers was FedEx Express when they retired the last of their 727s in 2013. FedEx continued to operate the DC-10 until the end of 2022, all of which were originally delivered with a flight engineer&#x27;s station, however all examples that were still in the fleet had been converted to MD-10 standard, which provided for a two-crew cockpit.

<text>Sexmission () is a 1984 Polish politically satirical cult comedy science fiction action film. It was directed by Juliusz Machulski based on a screenplay he co-wrote with Jolanta Hartwig and Pavel Hajný. Sexmission has earned the title of a cult film over time, although due to the film&#x27;s association of women&#x27;s emancipation with the communist dictatorship of the era of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, it was the subject of feminist criticism.

==Plot==

In 1991, Maksymilian &quot;Max&quot; Paradys and Albert Starski volunteer themselves for the first human hibernation experiment, created by professor Wiktor Kuppelweiser. Instead of being awakened 3 years later in 1994 as planned, they wake in the year 2044, in a post-nuclear world. They think they are in a clinic being taken care of by women; Max becomes attracted to Lamia Reno. After asking for professor Kuppelweiser, they are informed that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t exist&quot;, and that there was a war long ago and that males have long been extinct. The men are under constant surveillance; Lamia informs them their society reproduces without males through parthenogenesis. During a briefing, Max kisses Lamia, for which she knocks him down and threatens both men with euthanasia. However, the kiss causes Lamia&#x27;s drug-inhibited passions to resurface. She finds the oldest living woman Julia Novack, who tells Lamia that the old world with two sexes should be restored.

After several days, Max and Albert are permitted to go out to meet with Her Excellency, the supreme ruler of women. Waiting for her in the bio-sanctuary, they spot a tree with two tiny apples and eat them, having had enough of synthetic food. At the meeting they ask what womankind did to mankind. The women reply the extinction of men is not their fault, but Kuppelweiser&#x27;s, who, during the war, invented an agent which was supposed to temporarily paralyze male genes, but instead destroyed male genes permanently. Max proposes he and Albert serve as reproducers to restore the male population. However, the women do not wish the old order to return; Her Excellency gestures to the &quot;sacred apple tree&quot; and says it was planted by Arch Mother, and from which, when once in paradise, a male took an apple and seduced a woman with it, by which act paradise was lost. Noticing the missing apples, Her Excellency becomes enraged and demands the men be confined again.

Max and Albert escape by damaging the electric power grid, but are ultimately caught. The women provide them to submit themselves for &quot;naturalization&quot; - undergoing a sex reassignment surgery. When they refuse, the ceiling above the room reveals an assembly of women to determine their fate. In a trial, the women blame males for oppression, evil and vices, and praise their new society. They engage in historical revisionism by claiming that scientists such as Copernicus, Einstein and Pincus were women. When Max and Albert are taken away, the assembly votes on whether the men should undergo forced &#x27;naturalization&#x27; or be &#x27;liquidated&#x27;. Naturalization is passed by one vote. The men escape again, and encounter other women who have never seen a man. They are cornered by the security team and escape down a waste chute. They discover the nest of &quot;decadency&quot; - one of the anarchist, &quot;hippie&quot; women&#x27;s groups, who do not wish to be part of the oppressive regime, playing loud music, and some engaging in lesbian relations. They mistake Max and Albert for government spies and, in the meantime, the pursuing regime forces attack, and subsequent chaos provides the men with an opportunity to escape. During their escape, the men stumble upon Lamia, who provides them with a way to see the outside - a periscope - and reveals that they live deep underground in expanded old mines. The periscope shows a dark, rocky landscape above ground, and sensors indicate high levels of &quot;Kuppelweiser radiation&quot;, a side effect of the M bomb. However, it transpires that Lamia&#x27;s &quot;help&quot; was a ruse to capture the men and force them into surgery. Lamia is congratulated by Tekla and Emma Dax, but they also inform her that their section will now be in charge of the males, which devastates Lamia.

In the hands of Tekla, the fate of the males is to be different. Their organs will be extracted for transplantation, and their remains will be tested as a food source due to a protein shortage. The chief surgeon, Dr Yanda, an old lady, is revealed to be Max&#x27;s daughter, who now delights in taking revenge for his abandonment of his wife and child in favor of hibernation for profit. Lamia sabotages the surgery and helps the men escape as revenge for Tekla and Dax taking the men and her research. In the periscope room Lamia tells the guards she will blast the whole block if they do not give her the code activating a capsule reaching the surface, while Max and Albert find and change into protective suits. The guards claim that only Her Excellency knows the password required; enraged, Max shouts &quot;kurwa mać!&quot; (a popular Polish profanity as versatile as the f-word in English, lit. &quot;[your] mother&#x27;s a whore&quot;), and the capsule is activated. Exploring the barren surface, Max bumps against an invisible barrier and is unable to go further. He cuts the fabric of the barrier, revealing a dazzling light. They all go through the hole and find themselves on a beach, the periscope area surrounded by a small tent-like structure with the barren landscape panorama painted on the inside of the canvas. They reach a forest, but the suits are running out of oxygen. Max points skyward to a flying stork and declares &quot;if it can live, it means we can live too&quot;. After removing the suits, they come across a villa with food. While eating in the garden, they are found by Emma; armed with a harpoon, she demands their surrender, but she faints from lack of oxygen. Albert performs CPR on her. When she regains consciousness, Emma begins to fight with Albert; on the TV they see an official government broadcast of events, stating that Lamia and Emma are dead and including an interview with &quot;naturalized&quot; Max and Albert, who claim to be feeling well. Emma is shocked, unable to understand such lies and all the strange environment &quot;with too much air&quot;. Max goes with Lamia to a bedroom and tries to explain to her what mating is, while Albert tries his luck with Emma.

In the living room, Her Excellency emerges from the elevator hidden within a closet to feed her caged birds. When she opens the wardrobe, she is attacked by Max who was hiding inside. Her Excellency&#x27;s breasts and hair are stripped, revealing that &#x27;she&#x27; is a male in disguise. &#x27;Her&#x27; Excellency tells the men that after the war, when the League of Women took power, the few boys remaining were naturalized into girls, but he was hidden by his mother. Growing up in a female disguise, he joined the League and was eventually elected &#x27;Her Excellency&#x27;. He was too afraid of women to form a relationship with any and, by revealing himself, to try to restore the old order. The government has been exaggerating the radiation level to keep the inhabitants easier to control; likewise, the inhabitants are medicated to remove sexual desire. The three make a deal: Max and Albert will not compromise &#x27;Her&#x27; Excellency&#x27;s true identity, but they will stay in his home with Lamia and Emma. Later, Max and Albert, disguised as laboratory workers, add male gametes to flasks in the incubation centre. Months later, a nurse, routinely wrapping newborns in blankets, is horrified to see a penis.

==Political and social satire==
The film contains numerous subtle allusions to the realities of the communist-bloc society, particularly to that of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland just before the fall of communism, perhaps in the anticipation of the major events to come; the fall of communism and the rise of political liberty. When Max and Albert escape, they jump through the wall, which then starts to shake (often associated with later Lech Wałęsa&#x27;s jumping over the wall of the Gdańsk shipyard, and also with the subsequent fall of the Berlin Wall).

The secret meeting of the Women&#x27;s League apparatchiks and their lies to the women parallels the communist government of Poland.

The barren, hostile landscape of the supposed outside world (as seen via the periscope) is an allusion to the Communist era propaganda about the &quot;Capitalist West&quot; with its crime, decadence and poverty, and the scene where the heroes cut through the canvas to discover an entirely different world in many aspects &quot;better&quot; than the one they came from reflects the culture shock of many visitors from Communist Poland when experiencing the Western European countries for the first time.

This dimension of the movie appears to typically escape the viewer more removed from the context. Some sections of this kind were left out from the version shown in Polish theaters by the government censors, but many passed through.

The movie can also be viewed as a satire directed at intergender conflict (wrong-headed feminism or wrong-headed masculism), prudery, or totalitarianism.

The movie&#x27;s title is a word play on the Polish words &quot;Seks&quot; (Sex/gender) and &quot;Eksmisja&quot; (eviction).

==Reception==
In a contemporary review, &quot;Variety&quot; stated that the film was &quot;not up to the standards of those quality Polish pics of the late 1970s [...] nonetheless the best pic to emerge from the Warsaw studios over the past season.&quot;

The film has been very popular in Poland. It was proclaimed to be the best Polish film of the last 30 years in a 2005 joint poll by readers of three popular film magazines. However, this assessment by the audience was considered to be a surprise as it disagreed with the historical rankings of Polish movies by the professional film critics. They did not like the openly anti-feminist notions and its connection to totalitarianism. It received the &quot;Złota Kaczka&quot; award for the best Polish movie of 1984. The movie was also fairly popular in Hungary when shown a couple of years later.

Two cites from this film, &quot;Uważaj, tu mogą być promile!&quot; (&quot;Be careful, promiles could be in here!&quot;) and &quot;Dlaczego tu nie ma klamek?&quot; (&quot;Why are there not any handles in here?&quot;) were used in Polish dubbing of &quot;Shrek 2&quot; and were part of Donkey&#x27;s role, who was dubbed by Jerzy Stuhr (Max Paradys in &quot;Sexmission&quot;).

<text>Resistor–transistor logic (RTL), sometimes also known as transistor–resistor logic (TRL), is a class of digital circuits built using resistors as the input network and bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) as switching devices. RTL is the earliest class of transistorized digital logic circuit; it was succeeded by diode–transistor logic (DTL) and transistor–transistor logic (TTL). 

RTL circuits were first constructed with discrete components, but in 1961 it became the first digital logic family to be produced as a monolithic integrated circuit. RTL integrated circuits were used in the Apollo Guidance Computer, whose design began in 1961 and which first flew in 1966.

== Implementation ==

=== RTL inverter ===

A bipolar transistor switch is the simplest RTL gate (inverter or NOT gate) implementing logical negation. It consists of a common-emitter stage with a base resistor connected between the base and the input voltage source. The role of the base resistor is to expand the very small transistor input voltage range (about 0.7 V) to the logical &quot;1&quot; level (about 3.5 V) by converting the input voltage into current. Its resistance is settled by a compromise: it is chosen low enough to saturate the transistor and high enough to obtain high input resistance. The role of the collector resistor is to convert the collector current into voltage; its resistance is chosen high enough to saturate the transistor and low enough to obtain low output resistance (high fan-out).

=== One-transistor RTL NOR gate ===
With two or more base resistors (R3 and R4) instead of one, the inverter becomes a two-input RTL NOR gate (see the figure on the right). The logical operation OR is performed by applying consecutively the two arithmetic operations addition and comparison (the input resistor network acts as a parallel &quot;voltage summer&quot; with equally weighted inputs and the following common-emitter transistor stage as a &quot;voltage comparator&quot; with a threshold about 0.7 V). The equivalent resistance of all the resistors connected to logical &quot;1&quot; and the equivalent resistance of all the resistors connected to logical &quot;0&quot; form the two legs of a composed voltage divider driving the transistor. The base resistances and the number of the inputs are chosen (limited) so that only one logical &quot;1&quot; is sufficient to create base-emitter voltage exceeding the threshold and, as a result, saturating the transistor. If all the input voltages are low (logical &quot;0&quot;), the transistor is cut-off. The pull-down resistor R1 biases the transistor to the appropriate on-off threshold. The output is inverted since the collector-emitter voltage of transistor Q1 is taken as output, and is high when the inputs are low. Thus, the analog resistive network and the analog transistor stage perform the logic function NOR.

=== Multi-transistor RTL NOR gate ===


The limitations of the one-transistor RTL NOR gate are overcome by the multi-transistor RTL implementation. It consists of a set of parallel-connected transistor switches driven by the logic inputs (see the figure on the right). In this configuration, the inputs are completely separated and the number of inputs is limited only by the small leakage current of the cut-off transistors at output logical &quot;1&quot;. The same idea was used later for building DCTL, ECL, some TTL (7450, 7460), NMOS and CMOS gates.

=== Transistor bias ===

To ensure stability and predictable output of the bipolar transistors their base-inputs (Vb or base-terminal voltage) is biased.

== Advantages ==

The primary advantage of RTL technology was that it used a minimum number of transistors. In circuits using discrete components, before integrated circuits, transistors were the most expensive component to produce. Early IC logic production (such as Fairchild&#x27;s in 1961) used the same approach briefly, but quickly transitioned to higher-performance circuits such as diode–transistor logic and then transistor–transistor logic (starting in 1963 at Sylvania Electric Products), since diodes and transistors were no more expensive than resistors in the IC.

== Limitations ==

The disadvantage of RTL is its high power dissipation when the transistor is switched on, by current flowing in the collector and base resistors. This requires that more current be supplied to and heat be removed from RTL circuits. In contrast, TTL circuits with &quot;totem-pole&quot; output stage minimize both of these requirements.

Another limitation of RTL is its limited fan-in: 3 inputs being the limit for many circuit designs, before it completely loses usable noise immunity. It has a low noise margin. Lancaster says that integrated circuit RTL NOR gates (which have one transistor per input) may be constructed with &quot;any reasonable number&quot; of logic inputs, and gives an example of an 8-input NOR gate.

A standard integrated circuit RTL NOR gate can drive up to 3 other similar gates.
Alternatively, it has enough output to drive up to 2 standard integrated circuit RTL &quot;buffers&quot;, each of which can drive up to 25 other standard RTL NOR gates.

== Speeding up RTL ==

Various companies have applied the following speed-up methods to discrete RTL.

Transistor switching speed has increased steadily from the first transistorized computers through the present. The &quot;GE Transistor Manual&quot; (7th ed., p. 181, or 3rd ed., p. 97 or intermediate editions) recommends gaining speed by using higher-frequency transistors, or capacitors, or a diode from base to collector (parallel negative feedback) to prevent saturation.

Placing a capacitor in parallel with each input resistor decreases the time needed for a driving stage to forward-bias a driven stage&#x27;s base-emitter junction. Engineers and technicians use &quot;RCTL&quot; (resistor-capacitor-transistor logic) to designate gates equipped with &quot;speed-up capacitors&quot;. The Lincoln Laboratory TX-0 computer&#x27;s circuits included some RCTL. However, methods involving capacitors were unsuitable for integrated circuits.

Using a high collector supply voltage and diode clamping decreased collector-base and wiring capacitance charging time. This arrangement required diode clamping the collector to the design logic level. This method was also applied to discrete DTL (diode–transistor logic).

Another method that was familiar in discrete-device logic circuits used a diode and a resistor, a germanium and a silicon diode, or three diodes in a negative feedback arrangement. These diode networks known as various Baker clamps reduced the voltage applied to the base as the collector approached saturation. Because the transistor went less deeply into saturation, the transistor accumulated fewer stored charge carriers. Therefore, less time was required to clear stored charge during transistor turn off. A low-voltage diode arranged to prevent saturation of the transistor was applied to integrated logic families by using Schottky diodes, as in Schottky TTL.

<text>Diode–transistor logic (DTL) is a class of digital circuits that is the direct ancestor of transistor–transistor logic. It is called so because the logic gating functions AND and OR are performed by diode logic, while logical inversion (NOT) and amplification (providing signal restoration) is performed by a transistor (in contrast with resistor–transistor logic (RTL) and transistor–transistor logic (TTL).

== Implementations ==

The DTL circuit shown in the first picture consists of three stages: an input diode logic stage (D1, D2 and R1), an intermediate level shifting stage (R3 and R4), and an output common-emitter amplifier stage (Q1 and R2). If both inputs A and B are high (logic 1; near V+), then the diodes D1 and D2 are reverse biased. Resistors R1 and R3 will then supply enough current to turn on Q1 (drive Q1 into saturation) and also supply the current needed by R4. There will be a small positive voltage on the base of Q1 (VBE, about 0.3 V for germanium and 0.6 V for silicon). The turned on transistor&#x27;s collector current will then pull the output Q low (logic 0; VCE(sat), usually less than 1 volt). If either or both inputs are low, then at least one of the input diodes conducts and pulls the voltage at the anodes to a value less than about 2 volts. R3 and R4 then act as a voltage divider that makes Q1&#x27;s base voltage negative and consequently turns off Q1. Q1&#x27;s collector current will be essentially zero, so R2 will pull the output voltage Q high (logic 1; near V+).

=== Early diode logic with transistor inverter ===

Up until 1952, IBM manufactured transistors by modifying off-the-shelf germanium diodes, after which they had their own alloy-junction transistor manufacturing plant at Poughkeepsie. In the mid 1950s, diode logic was used in the IBM 608 which was the first all-transistorized computer in the world. A single card would hold four two-way circuits or three three-way or one eight-way. All input and output signals were compatible. The circuits were capable of reliably switching pulses as narrow as one microsecond.

The designers of the 1962 D-17B guidance computer used diode-resistor logic as much as possible, to minimize the number of transistors used.

===Discrete===
The IBM 1401 (announced in 1959) used DTL circuits similar to the circuit shown in the first picture. IBM called the logic &quot;complemented transistor diode logic&quot; (CTDL). CTDL avoided the level shifting stage (R3 and R4) by alternating NPN and PNP based gates operating on different power supply voltages. NPN based circuits used +6V and -6V and the transistor switched at close to -6V, PNP based circuits used 0V and -12V and the transistor switched at close to 0V. Thus for example a NPN gate driven by a PNP gate would see the threshold voltage of -6V in the middle of the range of 0V to -12V. Similarly for the PNP gate switching at 0V driven by a range of 6V to -6V. The 1401 used germanium transistors and diodes in its basic gates. The 1401 also added an inductor in series with R2. The physical packaging used the IBM Standard Modular System.

===Integrated===
In an integrated circuit version of the DTL gate, R3 is replaced by two level-shifting diodes connected in series. Also the bottom of R4 is connected to ground to provide bias current for the diodes and a discharge path for the transistor base. The resulting integrated circuit runs off a single power supply voltage.

In 1962, Signetics introduced the SE100-series family, the first high-volume DTL chips. In 1964, Fairchild released the 930-series DTμL micrologic family that had a better noise immunity, smaller die, and lower cost. It was the most commercially successful DTL family and copied by other IC manufacturers.

== Speed improvement ==
The DTL propagation delay is relatively large. When the transistor goes into saturation from all inputs being high, charge is stored in the base region. When it comes out of saturation (one input goes low) this charge has to be removed and will dominate the propagation time.

One way to speed up DTL is to add a small &quot;speed-up&quot; capacitor across R3. The capacitor helps to turn off the transistor by removing the stored base charge; the capacitor also helps to turn on the transistor by increasing the initial base drive.

Another way to speed up DTL is to avoid saturating the switching transistor. That can be done with a Baker clamp. The Baker clamp is named for Richard H. Baker, who described it in his 1956 technical report &quot;Maximum Efficiency Switching Circuits&quot;.

In 1964, James R. Biard filed a patent for the Schottky transistor. In his patent the Schottky diode prevented the transistor from saturating by minimizing the forward bias on the collector–base transistor junction, thus reducing the minority carrier injection to a negligible amount. The diode could also be integrated on the same die, had a compact layout, no minority-carrier charge storage, and was faster than a conventional junction diode. His patent also showed how the Schottky transistor could be used in DTL circuits and improve the switching speed of other saturated logic designs, such as Schottky-TTL, at a low cost.

== Interfacing considerations ==
A major advantage over the earlier resistor–transistor logic is increased fan-in. Additionally, to increase fan-out, an additional transistor and diode may be used.

<text>&quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Last Song&quot; (at the Grey Havens) is a poem by J. R. R. Tolkien, written as a pendant to his fantasy &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. It was first published in a Dutch translation in 1973, subsequently appearing in English on posters in 1974 and as a picture-book in 1990. It was illustrated by Pauline Baynes, and set to music by Donald Swann and Stephen Oliver. The poem&#x27;s copyright was owned by Tolkien&#x27;s secretary, to whom he gave it in gratitude for her work for him.

==Gift to Joy Hill==

In 1968, aged seventy-six, Tolkien decided to retire from his house at 76 Sandfield Road, Headington, Oxford to a bungalow at 19 Lakeside Road, Poole, near Bournemouth. On 17 June, while preparing for his relocation, he fell downstairs and badly injured his leg. He needed surgery, a plaster cast, crutches and several weeks of recuperation in the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre and Bournemouth&#x27;s Miramar Hotel before he was well enough to resume living independently. When he finally moved into his new home on 16 August, he found that unpacking his forty-eight crates of books and papers was too much for him. He sought the help of Margaret Joy Hill, a secretary whom his publisher, Allen &amp; Unwin, had assigned to deal with his fan mail, and whom he and his wife had come to regard almost as a second daughter. During &quot;circa&quot; 14–18 October, while Hill was helping Tolkien to set up his new office and library, she made a discovery. &quot;As I picked up a pile of books in my arms and put them on the shelf&quot;, she recalled in 1990, &quot;something dropped out from between two of them. It was an exercise book: just the cover with a single sheet between, and on the page, a poem. [Tolkien] asked what it was; I gave it to him, and he read it aloud. It was &quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Last Song&quot;.

The fan mail that Hill brought from Allen &amp; Unwin to Tolkien included many packages. Hill and Tolkien used to enjoy guessing what kind of presents his devotees had sent to him. &quot;One day&quot;, she remembered, &quot;as he cut the string on a packet, he said &#x27;If I find this is a gold bracelet studded with diamonds, it is to be yours.&#x27; Of course it wasn&#x27;t, but the bracelet became a joke between us.&quot; On a later visit on &quot;circa&quot; 3 September 1970, Hill recollected, &quot;[Tolkien] said: &#x27;We&#x27;ve opened all the parcels and there was no gold bracelet for you. I&#x27;ve decided that &quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Last Song&quot; is going to be your bracelet.&#x27;&quot; Tolkien formalized his gift on 28 October 1971, sending Hill an annotated typescript of the poem and a covering letter: &quot;Dear Joy, I have appended the following note to the copy of &quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Last Song&quot; (at the Grey Havens) which I retain. A copy of this poem was presented to Miss M. Joy Hill on 3 September 1970, and also the ownership of the copyright of this poem, with the intention that she should have the right to publish it, or to dispose of the copyright, as she might wish to do, at any time after my death. This was a free gift as a token of gratitude for her work on my behalf. J. R. R. Tolkien.&quot;

Tolkien died on 2 September 1973, and Hill arranged for the poem to be published shortly afterwards. When she herself died in 1991, the poem&#x27;s copyright was bequeathed to the Order of the Holy Paraclete, an Anglican educational foundation.

==The text==
The poem comprises three stanzas, each containing four rhyming couplets. It is a dramatic lyric that the hobbit Bilbo Baggins is supposed to have composed as he contemplated his approaching deatha &quot;nunc dimittis&quot; that could have been, but was not, incorporated into the final chapter of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The context of Bilbo&#x27;s making of the poem is that he, the hobbits Frodo and Sam and the elves Elrond and Galadriel have travelled to Mithlond, the Grey Havens, where they have been met by the elvish shipwright Círdan and the wizard Gandalf. Bilbo, Frodo, Elrond, Galadriel and Gandalf are preparing to board the elven ship that will carry them magically away from the mortal world of Middle-earth to the Undying Lands beyond the sunset. Bilbo&#x27;s verses acknowledge the ending of his day and the dimming of his eyes, bid farewell to the friends whom he will leave behind and look forward to the Lonely Star&#x27;s guiding him to &quot;west of West&quot;, &quot;where night is quiet and sleep is rest&quot;.

Little is known about the poem&#x27;s development. According to Christina Scull and Wayne G. Hammond, it began as early as the 1920s or 1930s in a composition in Old Norse titled &quot;Vestr um haf&quot;&quot;West over sea&quot;. As Scull and Hammond point out, the poem cannot have reached its final form until after Tolkien had conceived how &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; would conclude. A progress report on the writing of the book that Tolkien sent to his son Christopher on 29 November 1944 shows that the coda of his story had taken shape in his mind long before it was published in 1955: &quot;The final scene will be the passage of Bilbo and Elrond and Galadriel through the woods of the Shire on their way to the Grey Havens. Frodo will join them and pass over the Sea.&quot;

== Precursors and parallels ==

Bilbo&#x27;s voyage to the Undying Lands is reminiscent of several other journeys in English literature. Scull and Hammond observe that &quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Last Song&quot; is somewhat like Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Crossing the Bar&quot; (1889), a sixteen-line religious lyric (sharing some of Tolkien&#x27;s poem&#x27;s vocabulary) in which a sea voyage is a metaphor for a faithful death. Other precursors of Tolkien&#x27;s poem are the legend of the carrying of the wounded King Arthur to the magical isle of Avalon and the quest of Reepicheep to sail to the holy country of the divine lion Aslan in Tolkien&#x27;s friend C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;.

Bilbo&#x27;s Otherworld journey has further parallels in writings of Tolkien&#x27;s own. The figure of the mortal who sails from the quotidian world to a paradise beyond the sea is a motif that recurs in Tolkien&#x27;s poems and stories throughout his creative life. Examples are Roverandom, Eriol in &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;, Tuor in &quot;Quenta Silmarillion&quot;, Ar-Pharazôn in &quot;Akallabêth&quot;, Ælfwine in &quot;The Lost Road&quot;, St Brendan in &quot;Imram&quot;, Sam and Gimli in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and the narrator of &quot;The Sea-Bell&quot; in &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;.

==Publication history==
&quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Last Song&quot; first appeared at the end of 1973, translated into Dutch by Max Schuchart for a limited edition of two thousand numbered posters that the publisher Het Spectrum distributed as corporate New Year&#x27;s gifts. In April 1974, Houghton Mifflin published the poem in the US as a poster decorated with a photograph of a river taken by Robert Strindberg. In September 1974, Allen &amp; Unwin published the poem in the UK as a poster illustrated by Pauline Baynes. Her painting depicts the hobbits Sam, Merry and Pippin looking down on the Grey Havens and watching Bilbo&#x27;s ship sailing down the firth of Lune.

In 1990, the poem was issued as a 32-page full colour hardcover picture-book illustrated with almost fifty of Baynes&#x27;s paintingsthe largest body of work that she created for any Tolkien projectby Unwin Hyman in the UK and by Houghton Mifflin in the US. A second hardcover edition was published in 2002 by Hutchinson in the UK and by Alfred A. Knopf in the US. A large-format paperback edition was published in both the UK and the US by Red Fox Picture Books in 2012. The second and third editions of the poem omitted some of the illustrations published in the first. Translations of the poem have appeared in Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Swedish.

==Pauline Baynes&#x27;s illustrations==

The endpapers of Unwin Hyman&#x27;s and Houghton Mifflin&#x27;s 1990 edition of &quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Last Song&quot; show Bilbo, Elrond, Galadriel and Gildor riding with a company of elves through an autumnal landscape, watched by a variety of woodland creatures. The text of the poem is then presented in twelve full-colour two-page spreads, each dedicated to a single couplet. The couplets are printed on the verso pages, each with a unique illuminated first letter and with a unique painting of a reposing Bilbo beneath. The recto pages present roundels narrating Bilbo&#x27;s journey from retirement in Rivendell to his arrival at &quot;fields and mountains ever blest&quot;: Bilbo is seen at his desk, looking out across the ravine of the Bruinen, talking to Elrond, mounting his horse, riding through the Shire, crossing Woody End, arriving at the Far Downs, meeting Círdan and Gandalf, hugging Sam, greeting Merry and Pippin, setting sail and nearing the Undying Lands. Each roundel is framed by a unique pair of overarching trees, beneath, on and above which are a multitude of birds and beasts: a beaver, a fox, an otter, badgers, bats, frogs, hedgehogs, mice, rabbits, squirrels, stoats, toads, a blackbird, a crow, a dove, a gull, a magpie, a wader, a woodpecker, some owls and many others. At the foot of every page, both verso and recto, is a vignette that depicts a scene from the adventures of Bilbo that Tolkien had told in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Baynes&#x27;s twenty-six &quot;Hobbit&quot; paintings illustrate many scenes not represented in Tolkien&#x27;s own &quot;Hobbit&quot; art, including, for example, the dwarves&#x27; feast in Bag End and their meetings with Elrond and Thranduil, Bilbo&#x27;s finding of the One Ring and his conversation with Gollum, Bilbo&#x27;s and Gandalf&#x27;s meeting with Beorn, Bilbo&#x27;s fight with the spiders of Mirkwood and the Battle of Five Armies. Anonymous notes at the back of the book key Baynes&#x27;s paintings to the passages in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; which they illustrate.

Hutchinson&#x27;s and Knopf&#x27;s 2002 edition of the poem is broadly similar to Unwin Hyman&#x27;s and Houghton Mifflin&#x27;s earlier version, allocating each of Tolkien&#x27;s couplets its own two-page spread and including most of Baynes&#x27;s 1990 artwork. However, it omits all but one of Baynes&#x27;s pictures of Bilbo at rest, and it switches her arcing trees from recto pages to verso to frame Tolkien&#x27;s couplets rather than her roundels. Red Fox&#x27;s large paperback edition of 2012 restores the material and design that Hutchinson and Knopf reject, but omits the endpaper painting that decorates its predecessors.

==Adaptations==

The first composer to set &quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Last Song&quot; to music was Tolkien&#x27;s fan and friend Donald Swann, who had earlier set six of Tolkien&#x27;s other poems for their 1967 song-book &quot;The Road Goes Ever On&quot;. Swann wrote about &quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Last Song&quot; in his autobiography. &quot;The lyric was handed to me at Tolkien&#x27;s funeral by his dedicated secretary, Joy Hill, who is a close friend and neighbour of mine in Battersea. I was stirred up that day and went off and wrote a tune for it, to be sung as a duet, although I often perform it solo... The tune is based on a song from the Isle of Man ... [and] also resembles a Cephallonian Greek melody.&quot; Swann&#x27;s setting of the poemhis favourite among his Tolkien compositionswas added to &quot;The Road Goes Ever On&quot; for its second (1978) and third (2002) editions. The latter included a CD on which Swann performed his song with William Elvin and Clive McCrombie. The song was also recorded on Swann&#x27;s album &quot;Alphabetaphon&quot; (1990) and John Amis&#x27;s album &quot;Amiscellany&quot; (2002)

In 1981, Brian Sibley and Michael Bakewell used &quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Last Song&quot; to conclude the dramatization of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; that they wrote for BBC Radio 4. The poem was set to music by Stephen Oliver, who had provided all the music for the series. The first stanza was chanted by John Le Mesurier as Bilbo, the second was omitted and the third was sung by the boy soprano Matthew Vine. An album of Oliver&#x27;s music from the series included a version of the song in which Vine sang all three stanzas. Oliver&#x27;s version was recorded by the Dutch Tolkien Society band The Hobbitons for their 1996 CD &quot;J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Songs from Middle-earth&quot;.

Peter Jackson did not follow Sibley&#x27;s and Bakewell&#x27;s example when adapting &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; for the cinema. His 2003 movie &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; concludes not with &quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Last Song&quot; but with &quot;Into the West&quot;, a song similar in mood to Oliver&#x27;s written by Fran Walsh, Annie Lennox and Howard Shore, and performed by Lennox over the movie&#x27;s closing credits. A Howard Shore composition for choir and orchestra called &quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Song&quot; accompanies part of the Fan Club Credits on home media releases of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;″s Extended Edition, but this has nothing to do with &quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Last Song&quot;; its text is a translation into Tolkien&#x27;s invented Sindarin of his poem &quot;I Sit Beside the Fire and Think&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Tom Shippey brackets &quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Last Song&quot; with Tolkien&#x27;s late, elegiac short story &quot;Smith of Wootton Major&quot; and with his valedictory address to the University of Oxford. &quot;[Bilbo&#x27;s] words could, ... entirely appropriately for myth, be removed from their &#x27;Grey Havens&#x27; context and be heard as the words of a dying man: but one dying contented with his life and what he had achieved, and confident of the existence of a world and a fate beyond Middle-earth.&quot;

Brian Rosebury judges the text of the poem to be banal and its couplets technically inept. He suggests that Tolkien would have been wiser to allow Bilbo&#x27;s final poetic utterance to be the version of his song &quot;The Road Goes Ever On&quot; that he recites by the fireside in his room in Rivendell near the end of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;.

<doc id="417757" wikidata="Q1065599" url="?curid=417757" title="Meat Is Murder">
<text>Meat Is Murder is the second studio album by English rock band the Smiths, released on 11 February 1985 by Rough Trade Records. It became the band&#x27;s only studio album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart, and stayed on the chart for 13 weeks. The album was an international success: it spent 11 weeks in the European Top 100 Albums chart, peaking at number 29. It also reached number 110 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States.

==Writing and recording==
After the band&#x27;s 1984 debut studio album, lead vocalist Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr produced the album themselves, assisted only by engineer Stephen Street. They had first met Stephen Street on the session for &quot;Heaven Knows I&#x27;m Miserable Now&quot; and requested his contact number. Officially, the record&#x27;s production is credited to &quot;The Smiths&quot;.

To build the album&#x27;s soundscape, Morrissey provided Marr and Street with his personal copies of BBC sound effects records from which to source samples. Morrissey would continue this practice on future Smiths singles and albums.

&quot;Meat Is Murder&quot; was more strident and political than its predecessor, including the pro-vegetarian title track (Morrissey forbade the rest of the band from being photographed eating meat), and the anti-corporal punishment &quot;The Headmaster Ritual&quot;. Musically, the band had grown more adventurous, with Marr and Rourke channelling rockabilly and funk influences in &quot;Rusholme Ruffians&quot; and &quot;Barbarism Begins at Home&quot;, respectively. &quot;Rusholme Ruffians&quot; interpolates the Victoria Wood song &quot;Fourteen Again&quot;. Author John King has suggested that the title track was inspired by the 1983 song &quot;Meat Means Murder&quot; by the anarcho-punk band Conflict, which deals with the same topic and also opens at a slow pace.

Morrissey also brought a political stance to many of his interviews. Among his targets were the Thatcher administration, the monarchy, and his musical contemporaries. When asked about Band Aid, which was being strongly promoted in the UK media at the time, he quipped, &quot;One can have great concern for the people of Ethiopia, but it&#x27;s another thing to inflict daily torture on the people of England&quot;. Similarly, he began to promote vegetarianism in live shows and interviews, on one occasion convincing a Scottish TV show to air footage of slaughterhouses during the dinner hour.

==Cover art==

The album&#x27;s sleeve uses a 1967 photograph of an American Marine, Cpl. Michael Wynn, in Vietnam, though with the wording on his helmet changed from &quot;Make War Not Love&quot; to &quot;Meat Is Murder&quot;. The original image was used for Emile de Antonio&#x27;s 1968 Oscar-nominated documentary &quot;In the Year of the Pig&quot;. Wynn stated in 2019 that he was never asked permission for the use of the photo, and that he &quot;wasn’t real happy&quot; that the wording on the helmet was changed.

==Legacy==
In 2003, &quot;Meat Is Murder&quot; was ranked number 295 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and 296 in a 2012 revised list. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; (2005).

==Use in other media==
In 2016, animal rights advocacy group PETA released a video game titled &quot;This Beautiful Creature Must Die&quot;, based on the song &quot;Meat Is Murder&quot;. The game, which featured a chiptune rendition of the song, tasked players with clicking on their screens before different kinds of animals get chopped up in a death spiral.

==Track listing==


Note
* &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot; was added to the original American LP as the first song on side 2. The song is listed on the vinyl label, but it is not listed on the track listing on the inner or outer sleeve. All US releases prior to 2011 include the song. In the UK, the original LP and CD did not include it, though it was included on the 1993 CD re-release. The 2011 remaster, both CD and LP, restored the original UK track listing in both the UK and US.

<doc id="417758" wikidata="Q3198060" url="?curid=417758" title="Knowlton Nash">
<text>Cyril Knowlton Nash (November 18, 1927 – May 24, 2014) was a Canadian journalist, author and news anchor. He was senior anchor of CBC Television&#x27;s flagship news program, &quot;The National&quot; from 1978 until his retirement in 1988. He began his career in journalism by selling newspapers on the streets of Toronto during World War II. Before age 20, he was a professional journalist for British United Press (BUP). After some time as a freelance foreign correspondent, he became the CBC&#x27;s Washington correspondent during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, also covering stories in South and Central America and Vietnam. He moved back to Toronto in 1968 to join management as head of CBC&#x27;s news and information programming, then stepped back in front of the camera in 1978 as anchor of CBC&#x27;s late evening news program, &quot;The National&quot;. He stepped down from that position in 1988 to make way for Peter Mansbridge. Nash wrote several books about Canadian journalism and television, including his own memoirs as a foreign correspondent.

== Early life ==
Nash was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on November 18, 1927, and named &quot;Cyril&quot; after his father, a racetrack betting manager. The young boy disliked being called &quot;Cyril Junior&quot; and, at age five, asked his parents to instead call him by his middle name, Knowlton. From an early age, Nash was fascinated with the world of journalism: by age 8, he was writing his own news sheet and selling advertising space to local merchants in exchange for candy. By age nine he was writing letters to the editors of Toronto newspapers, and by age 10 he was operating a newsstand. In 1940, at age 12, Nash was a newspaper boy on the streets of Toronto selling the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and &quot;Toronto Telegram&quot; for three cents a copy. Seeing Joel McCrea play a trench-coated reporter in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s wartime thriller &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot; further fuelled his personal ambition to become a journalist.

==Career==

===Print journalism===
In his early teens, Nash reported on weekly high school sports for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. In 1944, he dropped out of high school to become editor of &quot;Canadian High News&quot;, a small weekly tabloid distributed to most high schools in southern Ontario. His fellow staff members included Keith Davey and Robert McMichael.

The following year, he spent some time editing a couple of crime magazines, then reported for a Toronto neighbourhood newspaper for a few months. Nash and some former staff members from &quot;Canadian High News&quot; then bought up two neighbourhood newspapers, but with little advertising revenue, both papers quickly ran out of money and went out of business. Nash briefly tried his hand at writing for pulp magazines &quot;True Confessions&quot; and &quot;True Crime&quot;.

===Wire service reporter===
Nash briefly attended the University of Toronto but in 1947, at age 19, he was hired as night editor in the Toronto office of BUP, a wire news service affiliated with United Press. This position mainly involved &quot;scalping&quot; news stories from the Toronto newspapers—rewriting stories covered by the newspapers, then filing them by teletype. After a few months, Nash also started to write original feature articles, and was also sent to cover the Ontario provincial legislature as well as professional sports events in Toronto. The following year, Nash was assigned to BUP&#x27;s Halifax office as bureau manager, responsible for news coverage in The Maritimes and Newfoundland. In 1949, he was promoted to manager of BUP&#x27;s Vancouver office, where he covered the protests by the &quot;Sons of Freedom&quot; sect of Doukhobors, and interviewed various celebrities, including Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallee.

In 1951, at age 23, Nash returned to BUP&#x27;s Toronto office, this time as bureau manager. Among other stories, he covered the death of William &quot;Red&quot; Hill Jr., who died trying to emulate his daredevil father by going over Niagara Falls in a floating contraption; and the 1951 Canadian royal tour of Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip.

===IFAP editor and researcher===
In 1951, Nash was hired by the Washington, D.C.–based International Federation of Agricultural Producers (IFAP) to gather information and edit their monthly newsletter. His office was right across the street from the White House—he would often see President Harry S Truman walking by with his Secret Service detail on noon-hour walks. Research for his work brought him in touch with many officials, and he quickly developed a network of contacts within Washington power circles.

His work with IFAP made Nash a world traveller, with a dozen trips to Europe by steamship, plus visits to Mexico and Central America as well as Africa. It also brought him in contact with many notables, including Pope Pius XII, Dag Hammarskjöld, Lord Boyd Orr, Dwight D. Eisenhower and future Dutch prime minister Barend Biesheuvel.

It was on a trip to Kenya during the Mau Mau Uprising in 1954 that Nash also became a freelance foreign correspondent, sending several radio reports on the unrest to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) while he attended an IFAP conference in Nairobi. He continued to file freelance stories for the CBC and the &quot;Financial Post&quot; while travelling abroad, and became a stringer for the &quot;Windsor Star&quot;. He also occasionally wrote for the &quot;Family Herald&quot;, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Chatelaine&quot; and the &quot;Star Weekly&quot;.

===Freelance journalist===
Having developed a strong network of contacts in the Washington area, Nash left IFAP to become a freelance journalist in 1958. Politics had always been a passion, and in order to write and file stories for many media outlets, he now had the opportunity to meet many American politicians, including Joseph McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Adlai Stevenson, Lyndon B. Johnson, and the up-and-coming John F. Kennedy and his brothers Robert and Ted Kennedy. His first major political event was the 1960 Democratic National Convention, where he was an eyewitness to many of the backroom and convention floor deals that resulted in the nomination of John F. Kennedy.

Nash&#x27;s first television news assignment was covering the funeral of John Foster Dulles for the CBC on May 27, 1959. Nash initially was not that interested in doing television reports, which only earned him the same fee as radio reports but took much longer to prepare; but he soon realized that the future of news reportage lay in television, and from that point on he did all he could to learn about the new medium.

In addition to covering political news in Washington, Nash also travelled around the United States and internationally. His many assignments included
* the race riots in Oxford, Mississippi that resulted when federal soldiers were deployed to allow James Meredith to become the first Black student to be admitted to the University of Mississippi.
* the launch of the Project Mercury rocket &quot;Friendship 7&quot; from Cape Canaveral, making John Glenn the first American to orbit the Earth.
* the Cuban Missile Crisis. (Nash waited in the White House for news during the perceived height of the crisis on the evening of Saturday, October 27, 1962, despite the apparent risk of a Russian atomic attack on the American capital.)
* a three-week trip to Cuba to see the effect of Fidel Castro&#x27;s takeover and the subsequent American trade embargo. While there, he found Che Guevara helping to harvest sugar cane and interviewed him about the Cuban revolution.
* the civil rights March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963, where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. 
* the aftermath in Washington of the assassination of John F. Kennedy
* the trial of Jack Ruby in February 1964
* the 1964 Republican National Convention that chose Barry Goldwater, and the 1964 Democratic National Convention that chose Lyndon B. Johnson.
* the Selma to Montgomery marches in May 1965
* the many riots during the summer of 1967, including Newark and Detroit.
* Robert Kennedy&#x27;s final lengthy interview just before he was assassinated in 1968.
* the violent 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. At one point, Nash was caught up in the street rioting and received a minor head injury.

Nash also travelled back to Canada to cover Canadian political events for CBC, including television coverage of election night for the federal elections of 1962, 1963 and 1965; the 1965 Saskatchewan doctors&#x27; strike; and the Gerda Munsinger sex scandal of 1966.

Freelance correspondents were not well paid by CBC, and in 1965, Nash helped to form the CBC Foreign Correspondents Association in order to negotiate a better wage for members, and became its first vice-president.

Nash also made extended trips abroad, including a half-dozen visits to Central and South America, and two trips to Southeast Asia to provide a Canadian perspective to the Vietnam War.
He also interviewed many prominent newsmakers of the time, including Pierre Salinger, George Lincoln Rockwell, Allen Dulles, Dick Gregory, Ronald Reagan, Colombian president Guillermo León Valencia, Venezuelan president Romulo Betancourt and Dean Rusk.

===CBC management===
Nash stepped down from reporting in 1969 to join CBC&#x27;s management in Toronto as Director of News and Current Affairs. Foreseeing the need to adopt new technologies to traditional journalism, he quickly upgraded the CBC&#x27;s late evening news program, &quot;The National&quot;, from black &amp; white to colour, and established an &quot;electronic information highway&quot; by dedicated phone line so that the Toronto office could quickly receive stories from distant parts of Canada. (At the time, CBC air-freighted film and videotape of news stories from other parts of the country to &quot;The National&quot; Toronto offices.) Nash also hired a new generation of producers and managers, including Peter Herrndorf as head of TV Current Affairs.

On October 15, 1970, during the October Crisis, Secretary of State Gérard Pelletier convinced CBC President George Davidson that the situation in Quebec threatened to grow into a widespread insurrection that would threaten the Canadian state, and that CBC reporting should not &quot;inflame&quot; the situation. Davidson asked Nash to ensure that CBC News would not indulge in &quot;speculative discussions&quot; about the crisis — in effect, self-censoring any political commentary. Nash immediately sent out a Telex to CBC staff to that effect. Two hours later, after some introspection, Nash realized that he was agreeing to government interference in the CBC&#x27;s reportage, and modified his Telex to instead call for &quot;responsible journalistic professionalism&quot;. Nash was candidly self-critical about his role in allowing the two hours of self-censorship, and later wrote, &quot;I certainly was not skeptical enough about what Pelletier had said to Davidson and let my nationalism override my journalistic values. There are times when that is necessary, but this wasn&#x27;t one of them and I was wrong.&quot;

Nash believed in the power of television to educate Canadians about their own history, and was instrumental in getting several series of &quot;docudramas&quot; on air despite protests from the entertainment and drama department that he was treading on their turf. These included the critically acclaimed &quot;The National Dream&quot; in 1974, about the politics behind the building of the transcontinental railway; &quot;The Tenth Decade&quot;, about the political rivalry between John Diefenbaker and Lester B. Pearson from 1957 to 1967; &quot;The Days Before Yesterday&quot;, about the ascendancy of the federal Liberal party in 1905 under Wilfrid Laurier to its almost complete collapse in 1957; individual series on both John Diefenbaker and Lester B. Pearson; &quot;Images of Canada&quot;, a look at the social history of Canada; &quot;The Age of Uncertainty&quot; with Canadian-born economist John Kenneth Galbraith; and a co-production with ITV about the Second World War.
Although most of these series garnered critical acclaim and good ratings, not everything was a success. In 1976, Nash and Peter Hernndorf launched a late-night current affairs talk show, &quot;Ninety Minutes Live&quot; with host Peter Gzowski, who, although good as a radio interviewer, was awkward on television. In an effort to prop up falling ratings, the initial &quot;current affairs&quot; focus of the show drifted towards entertainment, but audiences did not respond and the program was pulled after two seasons.

===Chief correspondent===
Following the departure of Peter Kent as anchor of &quot;The National&quot; in 1978, Nash was approached by the executive producer of the program, Trina McQueen, about becoming the anchor. Nash agreed to audition for the role, and was subsequently chosen. As a nod to his journalistic background as opposed to being simply a news reader, Nash was given the title &quot;Chief Correspondent&quot; rather than &quot;News Anchor&quot;. On his first night on air, November 20, 1978, his lead story was the Jonestown Massacre.

During his tenure as anchor, Nash covered the 1979 Canadian federal election, the sudden fall of the Joe Clark minority government and the re-election to power of Pierre Trudeau, the 1980 Quebec referendum on sovereignty, the 1980 Republican National Convention in Detroit that nominated Ronald Reagan and the subsequent election of Reagan to the U.S. presidency, the 1981 wedding of Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, to Lady Diana Spencer, the 1983 Conservative leadership review that saw Joe Clark replaced by Brian Mulroney, the February 1984 resignation of Pierre Trudeau after his &quot;walk in the snow&quot;, and the 1984 Canadian federal election that saw John Turner fall to Brian Mulroney.

Nash was also in front of the camera on January 11, 1982, when &quot;The National&quot; was controversially moved from its customary timeslot of 11 p.m. to 10 p.m., lengthened from 15 to 20 minutes, and joined to a new 40-minute current affairs program, &quot;The Journal&quot;, with hosts Barbara Frum and Mary Lou Finlay.

===Author===
In 1984, Nash wrote the first volume of his memoirs as a foreign correspondent, &quot;History on the Run&quot;. John Mitchell called it &quot;fascinating reading for anyone interested in a first-hand account of the political and social events of the 1950s and 1960s&quot;, and wrote of Nash&#x27;s style, &quot;His prose is crisp and precise. Yet the descriptive passages, in particular the John F. Kennedy funeral procession, evoke old memories and emotions in vivid detail.&quot; Nash subsequently wrote eight more books about his career, journalism, politics and Canadian broadcasting including &quot;Microphone Wars: A History of Triumph and Betrayal at the CBC&quot;, which traced the history of public broadcasting in Canada from its beginnings in the 1930s to the mid-1990s, chronicling the inside struggles at the CBC as programmers fought against the frequent short-sightedness of corporate executives while both sides coped with the hostility of federal politicians who refused to provide adequate, long-term funding. Harry J. Boyle, a veteran CBC insider and one-time chair of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), summed the book up this way: &quot;While it exposes corporate stupidities, political meddling and boozing executives, it vigorously endorses public broadcasting.&quot;

Nash&#x27;s books continued to garner favourable reviews, with critics often mentioning his in-depth research and personal knowledge of events and notable people. Geoffrey Stevens wrote of &quot;Kennedy And Diefenbaker: Fear And Loathing Across The Undefended Border&quot;: &quot;It is well researched, with a clear, tight focus. It takes the reader inside the councils of state to show how personal relations—especially hatred—at the highest levels can influence dealings between nations.&quot;

===Retirement===
In 1988, Nash offered to retire from his duties at &quot;The National&quot; in order to keep Peter Mansbridge from moving to the morning news at American network CBS. When Mansbridge accepted Nash&#x27;s offer and stayed at CBC, Nash stepped down as chief correspondent, although he continued to anchor &quot;The National&quot; on Saturday evenings and filled in as weekday anchor when Mansbridge was on assignment or on vacation. Nash fully retired from CBC News after anchoring &quot;The National&quot; on November 28, 1992.

After retirement from news-reading and reporting, Nash continued to host various programs on CBC Newsworld for several years. From 1990 to 2004, he was also host of the CBC&#x27;s educational series &quot;News in Review&quot;.

==Personal life==
Nash was married four times, although his final marriage, to CBC personality Lorraine Thomson, lasted for 32 years. Nash blamed the dissolution of previous marriages on his peripatetic life as a journalist and his over-dedication to his work.

Nash was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 2002 but remained sanguine about the diagnosis, saying that many other people faced much greater challenges. &quot;I can argue that I can get a couple of extra strokes in my golf game&quot;, he told the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; in 2006. He died on May 24, 2014, in Toronto, surrounded by his family. Shortly afterwards on &quot;The National&quot;, Peter Mansbridge broke the news of Nash&#x27;s death by telephone.

<text>Sir Basil Urwin Spence, (13 August 1907 – 19 November 1976) was a Scottish architect, most notably associated with Coventry Cathedral in England and the Beehive in New Zealand, but also responsible for numerous other buildings in the Modernist/Brutalist style.

==Training==

Spence was born in Bombay, Bombay Presidency, British India, the son of Urwin Archibald Spence, an assayer with the Royal Mint. He was educated at the John Connon School, operated by the Bombay Scottish Education Society, and was then sent back to Scotland to attend George Watson&#x27;s College in Edinburgh from 1919 to 1925. He enrolled at Edinburgh College of Art (ECA) in 1925, studying architecture, where he secured a maintenance scholarship on the strength of the &quot;unusual brilliance&quot; of his work. He won several prizes at the college, and meanwhile carried out paid work drawing architectural perspectives for practising architects including Leslie Grahame-Thomson, Reginald Fairlie and Frank Mears.

In 1929–1930, he spent a year as an assistant, along with William Kininmonth, in the London office of Sir Edwin Lutyens, whose work was to have a profound influence on Spence&#x27;s style, where he worked on designs for the Viceroy&#x27;s House in New Delhi, India. While in London he attended evening classes at the Bartlett School of Architecture under A. E. Richardson. Returning to ECA in 1930 for his final year of studies, he was appointed a junior lecturer, despite the fact that he was still a student. He continued to teach at ECA until 1939.

==Early career==

After graduating in 1931, Kininmonth and Spence set up in practice together, based in a room within the office of Rowand Anderson &amp; Paul (at that time having Arthur Forman Balfour Paul as sole partner), in Rutland Square, Edinburgh. The practice was founded on two residential commissions which Kininmonth had obtained that year. Spence also received commissions to illustrate other architects&#x27; work, including the Southside Garage, on Causewayside, Edinburgh, in an Art Deco style (although credited to Spence his name appears nowhere on the official warrant drawings and only appears as a signature on the artist&#x27;s perspective).

In 1934 Spence married, and the Kininmonth &amp; Spence practice merged with Rowand Anderson &amp; Paul. Balfour Paul died in 1938, leaving Kininmonth and Spence in charge of the renamed Rowand Anderson &amp; Paul &amp; Partners. Spence&#x27;s work was now concentrated on exhibition design, including three pavilions for the 1938 Empire Exhibition in Glasgow, and country houses.

The first two of these, Broughton Place at Broughton near Biggar, and Quothquan in Lanarkshire, were executed in traditional Scottish styles at the client&#x27;s request. The third was entirely modern. Gribloch was designed for John Colville, grandson of the founder of Colville&#x27;s Iron Works, and his American wife. It was designed in a modernist Regency style, with assistance from Perry Duncan, an American architect hired by the Colvilles when Spence was too busy with exhibition work to progress the project.

==Army service==

In 1939, Spence was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Camouflage Training and Development Centre of the British Army. He was initially based at Farnham in Surrey. His work included, prior to D-Day, the design of a counterfeit oil terminus at Dover as part of the Operation Fortitude deception plan for the Normandy landings. Spence subsequently took part in the D-Day landings in 1944. He was demobilised in September 1945, having reached the rank of major and been mentioned in despatches twice.

==Postwar career==

Spence returned to Rowand Anderson &amp; Paul &amp; Partners briefly, before setting up his own practice, Basil Spence &amp; Partners, with Bruce Robertson. He was awarded an OBE in 1948 for his work in exhibition design, work which he continued with the Sea and Ships Pavilion for the 1951 Festival of Britain. That year he opened a London office, moving there permanently from 1953. A second office was opened in 1956 at Canonbury, which became the creative hub of the practice. Spence was External Professor of Architecture at the University of Leeds from 1955 to 1957 and from 1958 to 1960 he was the President of the Royal Institute of British Architects.

Basil Spence &amp; Partners were responsible for the redevelopment and extension of the University of Glasgow&#x27;s Kelvin Building, which houses its School of Physics and Astronomy. The project was carried out in three phases. The first, 1947–1952, added a new lecture theatre and housed a synchrotron. Teaching laboratories and another lecture theatre were added in the second phase, which was finished in 1959. A third phase was completed in 1966 and included a museum to showcase Lord Kelvin&#x27;s old experimental apparatus. Some of this is still on display in the Kelvin Building today, with other items having been moved to form part of an exhibit at the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery. 

=== Coventry Cathedral ===

On 14 November 1940, Coventry&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral was extensively damaged by German bombing, a year into World War II.

In 1944, Sir Giles Gilbert Scott submitted a design proposal to rebuild the cathedral but this was rejected by the Royal Fine Arts Commission. In 1950, a competition was launched to find the most suitable design from a Commonwealth of Nations architect. Over 200 entries were received, and Spence&#x27;s radical design was chosen. Work began in 1956 and the structure was completed in 1962. Spence was knighted in 1960 for his work at Coventry, while the cathedral was still being built.

On 23 February 2012 the Royal Mail released a stamp featuring Coventry Cathedral as part of its &quot;Britons of Distinction&quot; series.

===Later work===

In 1959, Spence secured two important commissions, for the British Embassy in Rome (completed 1971), and for the Hyde Park Cavalry Barracks in London (completed 1970). He designed the high-rise Hutchesontown C social housing in Glasgow. These replaced notorious slum tenements in the Gorbals area of the city. A dense concentration of social deprivation in the area, coupled to poor execution meant these developments developed many problems, and they were demolished by explosives in 1993, with the accidental loss of one life.

Spence was responsible for contextual modernist buildings on The Canongate in Edinburgh, near the new Scottish Parliament and in view of Holyrood Palace, named Brown&#x27;s Close and listed in 2008. Other work in the 1960s included the concept design for the executive wing of the New Zealand Parliament Buildings in Wellington, nicknamed &quot;The Beehive&quot;, and Abbotsinch Airport (now Glasgow Airport).

In 1960, Spence designed Mortonhall Crematorium in Edinburgh&#x27;s Braid Hills area (based on the same angled fin concept as found at Coventry Cathedral). He provided architectural treatments for the elevations of Trawsfynydd nuclear power station, inaugurated in Snowdonia, north Wales, in 1968.

Also in 1964, with support from the Nuffield Foundation, the University of Southampton built a theatre on its campus. Spence worked closely with Sir Richard Southern as consultant for the interior design and layout of the theatre.

The Spence practice was rearranged in 1964, with the Canonbury office being renamed Sir Basil Spence OM RA, and the second London office Spence Bonnington &amp; Collins. The Edinburgh office was also renamed for its partners, Spence Glover &amp; Ferguson. From 1961 to 1968, Spence was Professor of Architecture at the Royal Academy.

Through the 1970s, Spence continued to work on public and private commissions, universities and offices including Aston University Library and Management Centre. His last work was for an unexecuted cultural centre for Bahrain, which he worked on during illness in 1976. Some of his final commissions were built after his death; for example, his design for the new Glasgow Royal Infirmary was completed in 1981.

Spence died in November 1976 at his home at Yaxley, Suffolk and was buried at nearby Thornham Parva.

His practice, Spence, Ferguson and Glover, continued until 1992 when it was disbanded.

==Assessment==

In 2004, following the bequest of Spence&#x27;s drawings and office papers, the Sir Basil Spence Archive project was begun by the RCAHMS (now part of HES). A centennial exhibition Basil Spence Back to the Future was organised in Edinburgh, Coventry and London in 2007-8. In 2006, he was the subject of a BBC Scotland documentary, &quot;Rebuilding Basil Spence&quot;, which revised his place in 20th-century British architecture and asked why he had been for so long overlooked. In 2012, the book &quot;Basil Spence Buildings and Projects&quot; was published by the RIBA as the culmination of the RCAHMS archive project and the work of the AHRC research project led by Louise Campbell of Warwick University.

In 1993 Spence&#x27;s Hutchesontown C complex was listed by the international conservation organisation DoCoMoMo as one of Scotland&#x27;s sixty key monuments of the post-war years, in the same year as it was demolished.

In August 2010, English Heritage recommended that the Spence-designed Sydenham School be given Grade II listed status: the building was due to be demolished to make way for a new building. However the government&#x27;s decision was that the school was not of sufficient merit to warrant listing.

<text>Pyroclastic rocks are clastic rocks composed of rock fragments produced and ejected by explosive volcanic eruptions. The individual rock fragments are known as pyroclasts. Pyroclastic rocks are a type of volcaniclastic deposit, which are deposits made predominantly of volcanic particles. &#x27;Phreatic&#x27; pyroclastic deposits are a variety of pyroclastic rock that forms from volcanic steam explosions and they are entirely made of accidental clasts. &#x27;Phreatomagmatic&#x27; pyroclastic deposits are formed from explosive interaction of magma with groundwater. The word &quot;pyroclastic&quot; is derived from the Greek , meaning fire; and , meaning broken.

Unconsolidated accumulations of pyroclasts are described as tephra. Tephra may become lithified to a pyroclastic rock by cementation or chemical reactions as the result of the passage of hot gases (fumarolic alteration) or groundwater (e.g. hydrothermal alteration and diagenesis) and burial, or, if it is emplaced at temperatures so hot that the soft glassy pyroclasts stick together at point contacts, and deform: this is known as welding.

One of the most spectacular types of pyroclastic deposit is an ignimbrite, which is the deposit of a ground-hugging pumiceous pyroclastic density current (a rapidly flowing hot suspension of pyroclasts in gas). Ignimbrites may be loose deposits or solid rock, and they can bury entire landscapes. An individual ignimbrite can exceed 1000 km3 in volume, can cover 20,000 km2 of land, and may exceed 1 km in thickness, for example where it is ponded within a volcanic caldera.

==Classification==
Pyroclasts include juvenile pyroclasts derived from chilled magma, mixed with accidental pyroclasts, which are fragments of country rock. Pyroclasts of different sizes are classified (from smallest to largest) as volcanic ash, lapilli, or volcanic blocks (or, if they exhibit evidence of having been hot and molten during emplacement, volcanic bombs). All are considered to be pyroclastic because they were formed (fragmented) by volcanic explosivity, for example during explosive decompression, shear, thermal decrepitation, or by attrition and abrasion in a volcanic conduit, volcanic jet, or pyroclastic density current.

Pyroclasts are transported in two main ways: in atmospheric eruption plumes, from which pyroclasts settle to form topography-draping pyroclastic fall layers, and by pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) (including pyroclastic flows and pyroclastic surges), from which pyroclasts are deposited as pyroclastic density current deposits, which tend to thicken and coarsen in valleys, and thin and fine over topographic highs.

During Plinian eruptions, pumice and ash are formed when foaming silicic magma is fragmented in the volcanic conduit, because of rapid shear driven by decompression and the growth of microscopic bubbles. The pyroclasts are then entrained with hot gases to form a supersonic jet that exits the volcano, admixes and heats cold atmospheric air to form a vigorously buoyant eruption column that rises several kilometers into the stratosphere and cause aviation hazards. Particles fall from atmospheric eruption plumes and accumulate as layers on the ground, which are described as fallout deposits.

Pyroclastic density currents arise when the mixture of hot pyroclasts and gases is denser than the atmosphere and so, instead of rising buoyantly, it spreads out across the landscape. They are one of the greatest hazards at a volcano, and may be either &#x27;fully dilute&#x27; (dilute, turbulent ash clouds, right down to their lower levels) or &#x27;granular fluid based&#x27; (the lower levels of which comprise a concentrated dispersion of interacting pyroclasts and partly trapped gas). The former type are sometimes called &quot;pyroclastic surges&quot; (even though they may be sustained rather than &quot;surging&quot;) and lower parts of the latter are sometimes termed &quot;pyroclastic flows&quot; (these, also, can be sustained and quasi steady or surging). As they travel, pyroclastic density currents deposit particles on the ground, and they entrain cold atmospheric air, which is then heated and thermally expands. Where the density current becomes sufficiently dilute to loft, it rises into the atmosphere as a &#x27;phoenix plume&#x27; (or &#x27;co-PDC plume&#x27;). These phoenix plumes typically deposit thin ashfall layers that may contain little pellets of aggregated fine ash.

Hawaiian eruptions such as those at Kīlauea produce an upward-directed jet of hot droplets and clots of magma suspended in gas; this is called a lava fountain or &#x27;fire-fountain&#x27;. If sufficiently hot and liquid when they land, the hot droplets and clots of magma may agglutinate to form &#x27;spatter&#x27; (&#x27;agglutinate&#x27;), or fully coalesce to form a clastogenic lava flow.

<text>Vlașca County is a former first-order administrative division of the Kingdom of Romania, in southern Muntenia, located between Bucharest and the Danube, which is now mostly the county of Giurgiu. The county seat was Giurgiu.

The county was located in the southern part of Greater Romania, in the southern part of the historical region of Muntenia. The county was bordered on the west by Teleorman County, on the northwest by Argeș County, on the north by Dâmbovița County, on the east by Ilfov County, and to the south by the Kingdom of Bulgaria. Its surface coincides in large part with that of the present Giurgiu County, but there are small parts of it that are included in today&#x27;s Teleorman County.

==Administrative organization==
Administratively, until the 1930s, Vlașca County was divided into five districts (&quot;plăși&quot;):
#Plasa Călugăreni, headquartered at Călugăreni
#Plasa Câlniștea, headquartered at Drăgănești-Vlașca
#Plasa Dunărea, headquartered at Giurgiu
#Plasa Glavacioc, headquartered at Glavacioc
#Plasa Neajlov, headquartered initially at Neajlovu, and later at Corbii Mari.

In 1938, the county was divided into seven districts:
#Plasa Călugăreni, headquartered at Călugăreni
#Plasa Câlniștea, headquartered at Drăgănești-Vlașca
#Plasa Dunărea, headquartered at Giurgiu
#Plasa Ghimpați, headquartered at Ghimpați
#Plasa Glavacioc, headquartered at Glavacioc
#Plasa Neajlov, headquartered initially at Neajlovu, and later at Corbii Mari.
#Plasa Siliștea, headquartered at Siliștea Gumești

==After 1938==
In 1938, the county was disestablished and incorporated into the newly formed Ținutul Argeș, but it was re-established in 1940 after the fall of Carol II&#x27;s regime - only to be abolished 10 years later by the Communist regime.

=== Population ===
According to the 1930 census data, the county population was 296,412 inhabitants, ethnically divided as follows: 97.1% Romanians, 2.2% Romanies, 0.2% Hungarians, as well as other minorities. From the religious point of view, the population was 99.4% Eastern Orthodox, 0.2% Roman Catholic, 0.1% Adventist, as well as other minorities.

==== Urban population ====
In 1930, the county&#x27;s urban population was 31,016 inhabitants, comprising 92.7% Romanians, 2.4% Romanies, 1.0% Hungarians, 0.7% Jews, as well as other minorities. From the religious point of view, the urban population was composed of 96.4% Eastern Orthodox, 1.3% Roman Catholic, 0.8% Jewish, as well as other minorities.

<text>There were two governments of the 2nd Dáil, which were ministries of Dáil Éireann, the assembly of Dáil Éireann that was the legislature of the Irish Republic, a unilaterally declared state which lasted from 1919 to 1922. The Second Dáil was elected at the 1921 Irish elections on 24 May 1921. The 3rd ministry (26 August 1921 – 9 January 1922) was led by Éamon de Valera as president and lasted 136 days. De Valera resigned as president after the Dáil voted to accept the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The 4th ministry (10 January – 9 September 1922) was led by Arthur Griffith as president. Griffith died in office on 12 August 1922, but a new Dáil ministry was not formed until 9 September 1922. Griffith served 214 days as president, with a further 28 days between his death and the appointment of W. T. Cosgrave as his successor by the Dáil.

The provisional government of Ireland, established under the terms of the Treaty, overlapped with the later period of ministries of Dáil Éireann. The 1st provisional government was led by Michael Collins as Chairman of the Provisional Government from 16 January 1922 until his death on 22 August 1922. On 25 August 1922, W. T. Cosgrave was appointed as his successor, with the other members of the new provisional government appointed on 30 September. The 1st provisional government lasted 218 days from the appointment of Collins until his death, with three days elapsing until the appointment of Cosgrave as his successor.

==3rd ministry==

The members of the 2nd Dáil first met on 16 August 1921. The outgoing ministry of Dáil Éireann did not resign immediately. On 26 August 1921, Éamon de Valera resigned as president. De Valera was then proposed by Seán Mac Eoin and seconded by Richard Mulcahy to the position of President of the Irish Republic and approved unanimously. This was a change of title, suggesting that de Valera was now considered as the head of state of the Irish Republic, rather than only its head of government.

De Valera then proposed the members of the 3rd ministry of the Irish Republic (26 August 1921 – 9 January 1922), which were approved by the Dáil.

==4th ministry==

On 7 January 1922, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was approved by Dáil Éireann in a vote of 64 to 57. Among those voting against were President de Valera. On Monday 9 January, he resigned as president. He was then proposed by Kathleen Clarke and seconded by Liam Mellowes for the position of president. This motion was defeated with 58 votes in favour to 60 against.

On 10 January, Arthur Griffith was proposed as President of Dáil Éireann by Michael Collins and seconded by Eoin O&#x27;Duffy. While the vote was to take place, de Valera and his supporters rose and left the Dáil chamber. Griffith was then approved unanimously by those members remaining in the Dáil. The members of the 4th ministry were then proposed by Griffith and approved by the Dáil.

Under the terms of the Treaty another cabinet, the provisional government, was also established on 16 January, with Michael Collins as Chairman of the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State. The 4th ministry therefore held office in parallel with the 1st provisional government. In August, Griffith died of natural causes and Collins was killed in action. The remaining members of the ministry remained in office until the Third Dáil elected a new ministry on 9 September under W. T. Cosgrave. Cosgrave had also been named as Chairman of the Provisional Government on the death of Collins in August, and from 9 September the personnel of the two cabinets were identical. Both cabinets were replaced by the Executive Council of the Irish Free State on 6 December 1922.

==1st provisional government==
The 1st provisional government was the provisional government that held office from 16 January – 30 August 1922. The provisional government was established under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty as an interim administration that would govern Ireland (not including Northern Ireland) until the establishment of the Irish Free State in December. Its members were nominated at a meeting of &quot;the members elected to sit in the House of Commons of Southern Ireland&quot; (pro-Treaty Sinn Féin and four unionist members), on 14 January, and they took up office two days later. The British government formally transferred power to the cabinet on 1 April. Headed by Michael Collins as Chairman, its membership consisted solely of members of the pro-Treaty wing of Sinn Féin.

At the time the provisional government was established there was a pre-existing executive administration in the form of the 4th ministry of the Irish Republic, but that cabinet was not recognised by the British government. The 4th ministry had come to office on 10 January, just six days before the provisional government, and continued in office after the latter&#x27;s establishment. There were thus two parallel administrations, with an overlapping membership.

After the Civil War began on 29 June four members of the cabinet were seconded for military service and substitutes were appointed to temporarily take their places as acting ministers. Two new members, Michael Hayes and Ernest Blythe, began serving as acting ministers on 17 July and were added to the cabinet as permanent members on 27 July. Collins was killed in action on 22 August and so the cabinet met and elected Cosgrave as chairman on 25 August. Five days later the entire cabinet was reconstituted as the 2nd provisional government. The Third Dáil met on 9 September and appointed the 5th ministry, with its membership identical to that of the newly constituted provisional government. This cabinet, with its dual identities, continued as the sole government, and was superseded on 6 December 1922 by the formation of the 1st Executive Council of the Irish Free State.

<text>The government of the 1st Dáil was the executive of the unilaterally declared Irish Republic. At the 1918 Westminster election, candidates for Sinn Féin stood on an abstentionist platform, declaring that they would not remain in the Parliament of the United Kingdom but instead form a unicameral, revolutionary parliament for Ireland called Dáil Éireann.

The first meeting of the First Dáil was held on 21 January 1919 in the Round Room of the Mansion House in Dublin and made a Declaration of Independence. It also approved the Dáil Constitution. Under Article 2 of this Constitution, there would be a ministry of Dáil Éireann led by a President, with five Secretaries leading government departments. There were two ministries of Dáil Éireann during the First Dáil. The 1st ministry (22 January to 1 April 1919) was led by Cathal Brugha and lasted for 69 days; it was formed when a large number of those elected for Sinn Féin were in prison. The 2nd ministry (1 April 1919 to 26 August 1921) was led by Éamon de Valera, leader of Sinn Féin, and lasted for 878 days.

==1st ministry==

The 1st ministry was a temporary cabinet headed by Cathal Brugha, because Éamon de Valera, the leader of Sinn Féin, was in prison at the time.


==2nd ministry==
On 1 April 1919, the 1st ministry resigned. On a motion proposed by Cathal Brugha and seconded by Pádraic Ó Máille, Éamon de Valera was declared elected as President of Dáil Éireann (). The Constitution was amended to allow for up to nine members of the ministry, as well as the President. The following day, he formed the 2nd ministry. Countess Markievicz became the first Irish female Cabinet minister. She served until 26 August 1921, and the next woman appointed to cabinet was Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, who was appointed as Minister for the Gaeltacht in 1979.

De Valera travelled to the United States in June 1919, and by letter requested that Arthur Griffith be appointed as Deputy President in his absence and that Ernest Blythe take a place at cabinet. De Valera resumed his position in the Dáil on 25 January 1921.

===Resignation of ministry===
In May 1921, the Dáil passed a resolution declaring that elections to the House of Commons of Northern Ireland and the House of Commons of Southern Ireland would be used as the election for the Second Dáil.

The members of the 2nd Dáil first met on 16 August 1921. The outgoing ministry did not resign immediately. On 26 August 1921, Éamon de Valera resigned as president. De Valera was then re-elected, taking the new title of President of the Republic, and formed the 3rd ministry of Dáil Éireann.

<text>Nicholas Walter Lyell, Baron Lyell of Markyate, PC, QC (6 December 1938 – 30 August 2010) was a British Conservative Party politician, known for much of his active political career as Sir Nicholas Lyell.

==Early life==
Born in London, he was the son of Sir Maurice Lyell, a High Court judge, and Veronica Luard, a sculptor and designer whose father, Lowes Dalbiac Luard, had been a contemporary of Augustus John and Walter Sickert. His mother died when he was 11, leaving Lyell and his sister Prue to continue their mother&#x27;s work to preserve the work of their grandfather.

Educated at Wellesley House School in the coastal town of Broadstairs in Kent and at Stowe School, he was his father&#x27;s best man when he married the also widowed Kitty, Lady Farrar, younger daughter of Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford. Lyell read modern history at Christ Church, Oxford, where he joined the Bullingdon club, and after National Service with the Royal Artillery trained as a lawyer.

==Legal career==
Lyell trained with the firm associated with his stepmother&#x27;s family, Walter Runciman and Co, and was called to the bar at Inner Temple in 1965. He served his pupillage with Gordon Slynn, and after being part of the team that debated a case over the world&#x27;s first onion-peeling machine, specialised in commercial and public law.

==Political career==
After unsuccessfully contesting Lambeth Central in October 1974, Lyell was elected Member of Parliament for Hemel Hempstead winning the seat from Labour in 1979, then Mid Bedfordshire from 1983, and moved to North East Bedfordshire at the 1997 election, having been defeated for the nomination by former Bristol MP Jonathan Sayeed in the Mid Bedfordshire constituency.

Lyell was one of very few lawyers to have combined a successful career in Parliament and a major private practice. He was also the longest continuously serving law officer for more than 100 years. After 20 years at the Bar he was appointed Solicitor-General from 1987 to 1992 under Margaret Thatcher, during which time he appeared in the Factortame case, and Attorney General for England and Wales and Northern Ireland under John Major from 1992 to 1997. He was knighted in 1987. He stood down as an MP at the 2001 election.

Commenting on Lyell&#x27;s retirement as an MP, Conservative Party chairman Michael Ancram said:
===Matrix Churchill affair===

Lyell was at the centre of the Matrix Churchill affair, the controversy to sell arms to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq. In 1996, the Scott Report directly criticised Lyell as Attorney General for trying to obtain a &quot;gagging order&quot; to prevent the disclosure of secret documents concerning machine tool and material supply to Baghdad. Prime Minister John Major chose to stand by Lyell.

==Peerage==
On 13 May 2005, it was announced that he would be created a life peer, and on 27 June 2005 he was created Baron Lyell of Markyate, of Markyate in the County of Hertfordshire.

==Other interests==
Lyell was a former chairman of the board of Governors of Stowe School, standing down from the role at the end of the 2006–7 academic year. Always interested in the countryside and culture, he was from 2005 Chairman of the Federation of British Artists at the Mall Galleries in London.

Lyell was an underwriting &#x27;Name&#x27; at the Lloyd&#x27;s of London insurance market. He joined in 1974 but suffered enormous losses in the bad years 1989 – 1992 as a result of the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster in 1988 and the tsunami of claims from asbestos-related Mesothelioma personal injury. His losses have variously been estimated to be between £622,591 and £2,000,000; he underwrote on numerous syndicates.

==Personal life==
Married to Susanna, the couple had two sons and two daughters. Lyell died in the Hospice of St Francis in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire after a 12-year battle with cancer on 30 August 2010.

<text>The AMX-13 is a French light tank produced from 1952 to 1987. It served with the French Army, as the Char 13t-75 Modèle 51, and was exported to more than 26 other nations. Named after its initial weight of 13 tonnes, and featuring a tough and reliable chassis, it was fitted with an oscillating turret built by GIAT Industries (now Nexter) with revolver-type magazines, which were also used on the Austrian SK-105 Kürassier. Including prototypes and export versions, over a hundred variants exist, including self-propelled guns, anti-aircraft systems, APCs, and ATGM versions.

==Development==
The tank was designed at the Atelier de Construction d&#x27;Issy-les-Moulineaux (AMX) in 1946 to meet a requirement for an air-portable vehicle to support paratroopers. The prototype ran from 1948. The compact chassis had torsion bar suspension with five road wheels and two return rollers; the engine runs the length of the tank on the right side, with the driver on the left. It features an uncommon two-part FL-10 oscillating turret, where the gun is fixed to the turret and the entire upper turret changes elevation. The turret is set to the rear of the vehicle and holds the commander and gunner.
The original 75 mm SA 50 gun was loaded by an automatic loading system fed by two six-round magazines located in on either side of the automatic loader in the turret&#x27;s bustle. The 12 rounds available in the drum magazines meant that the crew could engage targets quickly; however, once those rounds were expended, the vehicle commander and gunner could either manually refill them from within the turret or retreat to cover and reload shells from outside the vehicle through hatches above.
Production began at ARE (Atelier de Construction Roanne) in 1952, with the first tanks delivered the following year. In 1964, production was transferred to Creusot-Loire at Chalon-sur-Saône, as ARE switched to the production of the AMX-30 MBT, and the numbers produced declined significantly.

After 1966, AMX-13s in French service were up-gunned with a 90 mm CN-90-F3 L/52 medium pressure gun firing more effective high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) munitions; this variant was designated AMX-13/90. The F3 was similar to the DEFA D921/F1 low-pressure gun developed for the Panhard AML-90, and even utilized the same ammunition, though it possessed a significantly higher muzzle velocity. By the late 1960s, an export model of the AMX-13 was also available with an even larger 105 mm CN-105 L/57 gun in a FL-12 turret.

Although there were many variants on the turret, the basic chassis was almost unchanged until 1985, when changes including a new diesel engine, fully automatic transmission and new hydropneumatic suspension were introduced. Production halted with the AMX-13 Model 1987. After-sales support and upgrades are still offered through GIAT Industries (now Nexter).

The AMX-13 tank was phased out of service with the French Army in the 1980s. Current French armoured vehicles with a similar role are the ERC 90 Sagaie and the AMX 10 RC.

== Service history ==
=== France ===
During the Suez Crisis of 1956, the French Army used two sections of the 2nd Foreign Cavalry Regiment&#x27;s AMX-13 tanks in Port Fouad. The AMX-13s also saw limited action in the Algerian War, largely due to the rough terrain in most of Algeria and much of the fighting with the anti-colonial guerillas being in the difficult terrain of the countryside. France also fielded a number of AMX-13s fitted with US Chaffee light tank turrets in the fighting in Algeria.

=== Argentina ===
The Argentinian Army fielded locally-built versions of both the AMX-13-105 and the AMX-VCI armoured personnel carrier.

Argentine AMX-13s were not deployed during the Falklands War. Senior commanders considered that off-road conditions in the Falkland Islands were too boggy for all of the armoured vehicles available at the time. The newly developed Tanque Argentino Mediano (TAM) was not yet available. For on-road operations in the islands, Argentina&#x27;s Panhard AML-90 wheeled fighting vehicles were considered more suitable than the AMX-13. The higher speed and other aspects of the Panhard&#x27;s performance also represented acceptable trade-offs for its smaller (90 mm) main gun, relative to the AMX-13 (105 mm).

=== Dominican Republic ===
AMX-13s saw service among both the loyalists and the rebels during the Dominican Civil War of 1965. Two AMX-13s used by the rebel forces were destroyed by M50 Ontos of the United States Marine Corps during the subsequent American intervention in the Dominican Republic.

=== Israel ===

The AMX-13 was Israel&#x27;s first modern tank and was purchased at a time when France was the only country willing to openly sell arms to Israel. By 1956, Israel had ordered 180 AMX-13 light tanks as part of an agreement to reinforce Israel&#x27;s military and to maintain the balance in Israel&#x27;s favour after the Egyptian–Czechoslovak arms deal. Besides buying whole AMX-13s, Israel also purchased a quantity of SA 50 75mm tank guns for upgunning some of the American M4 Sherman tanks. Due to the shortage of tanks, the IDF used them as main battle tanks and employed them to form a tank battalion in the 7th Armored Brigade. IDF reconnaissance units did not use AMX-13s.

By 1967, Israel had less than 100 AMX-13s and formed three AMX-13 battalions, all of which fought actively on all fronts during the Six-Day War. The first battalion moved south in the West Bank area through Taluzi and Tubas and occupied Nablus (against Jordan). The second, attacking Egypt, captured the strongpoints protecting the Gaza Strip and the coastal road in the north of the Sinai Peninsula. The third, finally, assaulted the Golan Heights in southwestern Syria.

The IDF realised that the AMX-13 tank was too lightly armoured and had a weak main gun. Losses were heavy at places like Rafah Junction and Jiradi Pass during the Six-Day War with many destroyed by heavier Arab-fielded Soviet armour, such as T-55 MBTs and IS-3 (tank) heavy tanks. Subsequently, Israel gradually phased out all of its AMX-13s following the Six-Day War, with most ending up being sold to the then newly established Singapore Army between 1968 and 1969.

===India===

During the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War, India deployed AMX-13 Tanks to oppose the initial armour onslaught of Operation Grand Slam in the Chhamb-Jaurian area and also in the Battle of Asal Uttar.

During the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War in Chhamb-Jaurian in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, the 20 Lancers, equipped with AMX-13 tanks was under command of the 10th Infantry Division. Pakistan&#x27;s surprise attack on 1 September, Operation Grand Slam, fell on 191 Infantry Brigade which was supported by &quot;C&quot; Squadron of the regiment, under Maj Bhaskar Roy. The Pakistani armoured attack comprised two regiments, one of M48 Patton medium tanks and one of M36B2 tank destroyers. The attack began at 0805 hours and was strongly resisted. During the initial phases of the attack, Roy destroyed six Pattons, and three recoilless guns and captured a jeep. A second attack was launched by Pakistani armour at 1100 hours and contested by the AMX-13s of 20 Lancers, which despite being outgunned and outnumbered, destroyed a total 13 tanks that day and prevented the encirclement of 191 Infantry Brigade. The regiment later fought in the defence of Jaurian under 41 Infantry Brigade. For the defence of Chhamb-Jaurian, the regiment was awarded a theatre honour and Maj Bhaskar Roy was awarded Maha Vir Chakra for his leadership in this action.

In the Battle of Assal Uttar, on 8–10 September 1965 in Asal Uttar (Khem Karan, Punjab, India), a regiment of AMX-13s — 8th Light Cavalry — along with a regiment each of Centurions and M4 Shermans fought off and defeated a Pakistani armoured offensive comprising five regiments of M48 Patton tanks and one regiment of M24 Chaffee tanks.

=== Indonesia ===
The Indonesian Army received 175 AMX-13/75, 32 AMX-VCI (including 4 command variants and six ARV variants), and 10 AMX-13 PDP from France in 1960, which were delivered in 1960–1962. Indonesia then bought around 100 to 180 ex-Royal Netherlands Army AMX-VCI in 1976, which were modernized and delivered in 1977–1978. The last batch of AMX-13 family were bought in 1980–1981, when the Army acquired 130 second-hand but modernized AMX-13/105 from the Netherlands.

The AMX-13s first saw combat against the 30 September Movement in 1965, when they were deployed to secure Suharto&#x27;s control of Jakarta against an alleged coup by other generals&#x27;.

AMX-13/75 tanks and the VCI variants participated in the 1975 Indonesian invasion of East Timor (known in Indonesia as &quot;Operasi Seroja&quot;).

Indonesian AMX-13s also participated in the 2003–2004 Indonesian offensive in Aceh.

The AMX-13 gained momentary notoriety in Indonesian social media in September 2020, after an AMX-13 driver lost control when making a turn and ran over a street food vendor cart and four motorcycles. The accident happened on 10 September 2020 at around 11:00 WIB, at an intersection in Cipatat District, West Bandung Regency, during a 4th Cavalry Battalion company-level combat readiness exercise. No one was injured and the owners of the cart and vehicles were given compensation totalling 15.4 million rupiah.

=== Lebanon ===
The Lebanese Army was an important user of the AMX-13 in the Middle East, purchasing 42 AMX-13/75s and 22 AMX-13/105s from France in 1972. During the Lebanese Civil War, the Lebanese AMX-13s saw extensive service in the hands of the regular Lebanese Army and various armed groups in and outside Beirut between 1975 and 1990, following the collapse of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) structure in January 1976, and later again in February 1984 in the wake of the Mountain War. During this period, most of the regular Army&#x27;s AMX-13s fell into the hands of the competing Christian-rightist Lebanese Front and Muslim-leftist Lebanese National Movement (LNM) militias or were taken way by dissident rebellious Lebanese Army factions. France later delivered an additional 13 AMX-13/90s to the regular Lebanese Army between 1978–1981 and again in 1984. Captured AMX-13s were employed by the Lebanese Arab Army (LAA), Army of Free Lebanon (AFL), Kataeb Regulatory Forces (KRF), Tigers Militia, Lebanese Forces (LF), South Lebanon Army (SLA), Amal Movement, and the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA). Nearly all AMX-13s eventually were returned by the demobilized militias to the Lebanese Army between 1990 and 1993. Currently, none of the Lebanese AMX-13 light tanks is believed to remain operational.

In July 2018, six of these withdrawn AMX-13 and various other former Lebanese Army military vehicles were dumped in the sea off the coast of Sidon in southern Lebanon and used as part of an artificial reef.

=== Morocco ===
Morocco used some AMX-13s in the Sand War of 1963. Later on, they were engaged in the Western Sahara conflict. They were supplemented by the similar Austrian SK-105 Kürassier light tank during that war.

==In popular culture==
The AMX-13 has made some major TV and film appearances, most notably in the 1984 French war film &quot;Les Morfalous&quot;, where a Tunisian Army AMX-13/75 is mocked up as a German Panzer IV medium tank serving with the Afrika Korps.

Some variants of the AMX-13 are present in the video game War Thunder:
* The AMX-13/75 (AMX-13e)
* The AMX-Chaffee
* The classic AMX 13
* Israelian AMX 13
* The AMX-13/90 C90
