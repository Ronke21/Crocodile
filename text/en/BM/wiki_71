<text>United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (commonly referred to as US-VISIT) is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) management system. The system involves the collection and analysis of biometric data (such as fingerprints), which are checked against a database to track individuals deemed by the United States to be terrorists, criminals, and illegal immigrants. US-VISIT is accessed by 30,000 users from federal, state, and local government agencies. Upon Presidential approval of the 2013 Continuing resolution the US-VISIT program officially became the Office of Biometric Identity Management (OBIM), save for portions of the agency which performed overstay analysis being transferred into U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and biometric Entry and Exit operations which became a part of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

==Purpose and overview==

The U.S. government states that the purpose of US-VISIT is to advance the security of both the United States and worldwide travel, through the use and sharing of biometric information for identity management. U.S. Department of State consular officers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers collect biometric information (digital fingerprints and a photograph) from all non-U.S. citizens between the ages of 14 and 79, with some exceptions, when they apply for visas or arrive at major U.S. ports of entry.

CBP officials have the ability to instantly check the person seeking entry against several &quot;lookout&quot; databases using the Interagency Border Inspection System. In 2009, DHS announced that it had completed an upgrade from two-fingerprint to ten-fingerprint scanners at major U.S. ports of entry. The upgrade, which began in 2007, is intended to make the entry process faster and more accurate.

Initially, only visitors who required a visa inserted in their passport were included in the US-VISIT program. However, since September 30, 2004, visitors eligible for the Visa Waiver Program have also been required to use the US-VISIT program. Beginning January 18, 2009, most non-U.S. citizens (including lawful permanent residents) are subject to US-VISIT requirements.

The United States and Canada have special agreements for visa-free travel, and currently most Canadians are not subject to US-VISIT. U.S. citizens are not required to be digitally fingerscanned or photographed when they enter United States territory. The Department of State began issuing biometric passports to its citizens in 2006.

The program has been funded by Congressional appropriations of $330 million in fiscal year 2004, $340 million in 2005, $340 million in 2006, and $362 million in 2007. For fiscal year 2010, Congress appropriated $373.7 million and directed that $50 million be used to implement a biometric air exit capability.

==Statistics==
In fiscal year 2007:
*A total of 46,298,869 entries recorded at air and sea ports. 
*Of these, 236,857 were identified as possible overstays.
*The manual vetting system led to 273 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests.
*The databases resulted in 25,552 hits for consular officers overseas adjudicating visa applications. 
*There were 11,685 biometric watch-list hits at the ports of entry, which included individuals with criminal histories.
*United States Citizenship and Immigration Services used the system to screen those who apply for immigration benefits, creating 31,324 hits.

==Controversy==
Critics contend that the system is too inaccurate to be an effective solution. Barry Steinhardt, director of the American Civil Liberties Union&#x27;s Program on Technology and Liberty, states that the watch list is &quot;bloated and full of inaccuracy&quot;, calling the policy a &quot;total failure&quot;. He stated, &quot;Whether or not the loss of liberty is worth the security gained is not a question — because no security is gained.&quot;

The consulting company Accenture is the lead contractor for US-VISIT. The selection of Accenture in 2004 was controversial due to the location of the company&#x27;s headquarters. In 2000, Accenture was created and incorporated in Bermuda, as a separation of global business consulting services from the financial consulting services of Andersen Consulting. Because Accenture was created in 2000, and because Andersen was not previously incorporated, Accenture was never previously considered to be incorporated in the United States.

<text>Barons Court is a London Underground station in West Kensington in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, Greater London. This station serves the District line and the Piccadilly line. Barons Court is between West Kensington and Hammersmith on the District line, and between Earl&#x27;s Court and Hammersmith on the Piccadilly line and is in Travelcard Zone 2. East of the station, the Piccadilly line descends into tunnel towards Earl&#x27;s Court and the District line continues in a cutting to West Kensington. The station is the last open air stop for eastbound trains on the Piccadilly line until Arnos Grove and has cross-platform interchange with the District line.

==Location==
The station is located on Gliddon Road, a short distance from Talgarth Road (A4). East of the station, the Piccadilly line descends into tunnel towards Earl&#x27;s Court and the District line continues on the surface to West Kensington. West of the station, both Piccadilly line and District line continue to Hammersmith station. The station is located in a deep, brick sided cutting.

==History==

The tracks through Barons Court were first laid on 9 September 1874 when the District Railway (DR, now the District line) opened an extension from Earl&#x27;s Court to Hammersmith. When the line was constructed the area now known as &quot;Barons Court&quot; was open fields and market gardens to the west of the hamlet of North End and there was no call for a station between North End, Fulham and Hammersmith stations.

However, by the beginning of the 20th century, the area had been developed for housing and, on 9 October 1905, the District Railway (DR) opened a station to serve these new developments and in preparation for the opening of the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR, now the Piccadilly line), then under construction. The GNP&amp;BR began operations on 15 December 1906, running between Hammersmith and Finsbury Park.

In the 1990s, the Grade II listed station was carefully restored to its original appearance.

===Notable fatality===
The former Formula One driver B. Bira, who was a member of the Thai Royal family, was found dead at the station on 23 December 1985.

==The station today==
The station building was constructed to a design by Harry Ford in a style similar to that used at Earl&#x27;s Court and Hammersmith and is now a Grade II listed building as it retains many of its original features, including terracotta facing and Art Nouveau lettering. The wooden benches on the platform with the station name along the back on enamelled metal panels are a unique feature on the entire London Underground. The station has two island platforms to provide an interchange between the two lines - the inner pair of tracks is used by the Piccadilly line and the outer tracks by the District line. The station building has been Grade II listed since 14 February 1985.

==Name==
The name Barons Court is possibly inspired by the Baronscourt estate in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, where Sir William Palliser, who built part of the area, may have had connections. Unlike Earl&#x27;s Court station, Barons Court is written without an apostrophe.

==Services==
===District line===
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:
*12tph eastbound to Upminster (6tph to Barking on Sundays)
*6tph westbound to Ealing Broadway
*6tph westbound to Richmond

There is also a morning service every day from Acton Town (Ealing Broadway on Saturdays) to Edgware Road and a late evening service from Edgware Road to Ealing Broadway on Sundays only.

<doc id="421178" wikidata="Q4424031" url="?curid=421178" title="Penny Black VR official">
<text>The VR official was one of three postage stamps introduced by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in May 1840 for the pre-payment of postage. While the Penny Black and the Two Pence Blue were for use by the general public, as were the Mulready envelopes and letter sheets, the VR official was for use on official mail. In appearance the VR Official was the same as the issued Penny Black except that the Maltese crosses in the top corners were removed and replaced by the letters V and R, hence its common name.

The plate layout for this issue was the same in almost all respects as that used for the penny black and the two pence blue produced at the same time. The only difference in the marginal inscription was the plate identification which was shown as a letter, (see picture), rather than a number as used on the general issue of postage stamps.

The idea of this stamp was that it would be used on official correspondence from government departments. However, the public dislike and mockery of the Mulready envelope and letter sheets led to vast numbers of the Mulreadies being issued to the various departments, with the tax office being the heaviest user.

Since existing stocks could be used, the idea of the official stamp was abandoned. Nearly all of the supplies which had been printed were destroyed on 25 January 1843. Twenty-one sheets survived, a few of the stamps passed (invalidly) through the posts, and Rowland Hill used some to experiment with cancellation techniques.

==Forgeries==
The stamp was forged by Bernhardt Assmus in August 1890 who was unmasked by the dealer Morris Giwelb, to whom he had sold a forged copy of the stamp.

<text>Rakhigarhi or Rakhi Garhi is a village and an archaeological site in the Hisar District of the northern Indian state of Haryana, situated about 150 km northwest of Delhi. It is located in the Ghaggar River plain, some 27 km from the seasonal Ghaggar river, and belonged to the Indus Valley civilisation, being part of the pre-Harappan (7000-3300 BCE), early Harappan (3300-2600 BCE), and the mature phase (2600-1900 BCE) of the Indus Valley Civilisation. 

It was the largest settlement of the ancient civilisation, and, prior to 2014, most scholars believe it to have been between 80 hectares and 100+ hectares in area.
The discovery of two more mounds (in addition to the seven that were already known) in 2014 made Rakhigarhi the largest-known site of the Harappan civilisation. Other related excavation sites in the area are Mitathal and the smaller site Lohari Ragho, which are still awaiting excavation.

Initial excavations at the site happened in the 1960s, followed by further excavations in the late 1990s, however more sustained excavations have taken place in the past decade. though much of the area is yet to be excavated and published.

DNA-tests by Shinde et al. (2019) on a single skeleton show that the DNA did not include any traces of steppe ancestry, in line with the Aryan migration theory, which says that Indo-Aryans migrated to India from the steppes after the Harappan civilisation had started to disintegrate.

==Site characteristics==

===Location===
It is located in the Ghaggar plain, some 27 km from the seasonal Ghaggar river. Today, Rakhigarhi is a small village in Haryana State, India. According to Jane McIntosh, Rakhigarhi is located in the valley of the prehistoric Drishadvati River that originated in Siwalik Hills. Chautang is a tributary of Sarsuti river which in turn is a tributary of Ghaggar river.

===Site size and number of mounds ===
Most scholars, including Gregory Possehl, Jonathan Mark Kenoyer, Raymond Allchin and Rita P. Wright believe Rakhigari to have been between 80 hectares and 100+ hectares in size. According to Nath et al. (2015), &quot;[a]rchaeological remains at Rakhigari extend over a radius of [] encompassing a set of seven mounds of which 1 to 5 are integrated while a few are removed from each other.&quot;

The mounds are numbered following the naming convention of &quot;RGR-x&quot; e.g. RGR-1 to RGR-11. Until 2014, seven mounds were known. The 2014 excavation discovered two more mounds, RGR-8 and RGR-9, situated east and west of the main site, and largely destroyed for cultivation. According to Vasant Shinde each mound has a size of 25 hectares, taking the total site size to , and thus making Rakhigarhi largest Indus Valley Civilisation site by overtaking Mohenjodaro (300 hectares) by 50 hectares.

===Dating===
According to Garge Tejas the earliest settlements in Rakhigarhi predate the Indus Valley Civilization. According to Possehl not all mounds in Rakhigarhi belong to the same Indus Valley settlement, stating that &quot;RGR-6, a Sothi-Siswal site known as Arda, was probably a separate settlement.&quot; Mounds RGR1 to RGR-6 are residential sites belonging to &quot;pre-formation age early Harappan&quot; era, while mound RGR-7 is a burial site where human skeletons were found. 

ASI has carbon dated mound labelled RGR-1, RGR-2, RGR-6 and RGR-7. The RGR-6 has two layers of &quot;Preharappan Phase&quot; dating to 5,640 years before present (BP) and 5,440 (BP). The RGR-1 has &quot;Early Harappan Phase&quot; dating to 5,200 and 4,570 years BP. The RGR-2 also has &quot;Early Harappan Phase&quot; dated to 5,200 and 4,570 years as well as two additional samples belonging to &quot;Mature Harappan Phase&quot; dating to 4,040 and 3,900 years BP. RGR-7, which is a cemetery or a burial site from &quot;Mature Harappan Phase&quot;, dates back to 4600 BP.

In 2014 six radiocarbon datings from excavations at Rakhigarhi between 1997 and 2000 were published by archaeologist Amarendra Nath, corresponding to the Pre-formative, Early Harappan, and Mature Harappan phases. Mound RGR-6 revealed a Pre-formative stage designated as Sothi Phase with the following two datings: formula_1 and formula_2 years before present, converted to formula_3 B.C.E. and formula_4 B.C.E.

===Nearby sites and cultures ===
Rakhigarhi, being the largest town and regional trade centre of IVC era, is surrounded by numerous IVC sites nearby in Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab along the Gagghar-Hakra river course. The important ones among those are the Bhirrana (4 phases of IVC with earliest dated to 8th-7th millennium BCE) 86 km northwest, Kunal (belonging to &quot;Kunal cultural&quot; which is the cultural ancestor of Rehman Dheri site) 75 km northwest, Siswal (belonging to &quot;Sothi-Siswal culture&quot; dated to 3800 BC, contemporaneous to &quot;Early-Harappan Phase&quot;) 75 km west, and Kalibangan (another large regional IVC city with several phases starting from Early harappan phase) 235 km west, and few more.

There are many other important archaeological sites in this area, in the old river valley to the east of the Ghaggar Plain. Among them are Kalibangan, Kunal, Balu, Bhirrana, and Banawali.

==Excavations==
By 2020, only 5% of the site had been excavated by the ASI and Deccan College.

=== Chronology of excavations ===
While the earliest excavation of IVC sites started from Harappa in 1921-1922 and Mohenjo-daro in 1931, the excavations at Rakhigarhi were first carried out in 1969, followed by more excavations in 1997–98, 1998–99 and 1999–2000, between 2011–16 and 2021 onward. There are 11 mounds in Rakhigarhi which are named RGR-1 to RGR-11, of which RGR-5 is thickly populated by establishment of Rakhishahpur village and is not available for excavations. RGR-1 to RGR-3, RGR6 to RGR9 and some part of RGR-4 are available for excavations. 
In 1963, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) began excavations at this site, and, though little has been published about the excavations.

In 1969, Kurukshetra University&#x27;s team studied and documented the site led by its Dean of Indic studies Dr. Suraj Bhan.

In 1997–98, 1998–99 and 1999–2000, ASI team began to excavate the site again, which was led by its director Dr. Amrender Nath who published his findings in scholarly journals. After 2000, excavations were stopped for years because of a CBI investigation on the misuse of funds. Much of the findings are donated to the National Museum, New Delhi.

From 2011 to 2016, Deccan College carried out several substantial excavations led by its then Vice-Chancellor and archaeologist Dr. Vasant Shinde, several members of the team published their findings in various academic journals.

From 2021 onward, more excavation by ASI commenced. Central University of Haryana and Dr Vasant Shinde also expressed interest in commencing excavation.

===Discoveries===
Findings confirm both early and mature Harappan phases and include 4,600-year-old human skeletons, fortification and bricks.

====Planned city ====

The ASI&#x27;s detailed excavation of the site revealed the size of the lost city and recovered numerous artefacts, some over 5,000 years old. Rakhigarhi was occupied at Early Harappan times. Evidence of paved roads, drainage system, large rainwater collection, storage system, terracotta bricks, statue production, and skilled working of bronze and precious metals have been uncovered. Jewellery, including bangles made from terracotta, conch shells, gold, and semi-precious stones, have also been found.

Digging so far reveals a well planned city with 1.92 m wide roads, a bit wider than in Kalibangan. The pottery is similar to Kalibangan and Banawali. Pits surrounded by walls have been found, which are thought to be for sacrificial or some religious ceremonies. There are brick lined drains to handle sewage from the houses. Terracotta statues, weights, bronze artefacts, comb, copper fish hooks, needles and terracotta seals have also been found. A bronze vessel has been found which is decorated with gold and silver. A gold foundry with about 3000 unpolished semi-precious stones has been found. Many tools used for polishing these stones and a furnace were found there. A burial site has been found with 11 skeletons, with their heads in the north direction. Near the heads of these skeletons, utensils for everyday use were kept. The three female skeletons have shell bangles on their left wrists. Near one female skeleton, a gold armlet has been found. In addition semi precious stones have been found lying near the head, suggesting that they were part of some sort of necklace.

====Granary====
A granary belonging to mature Harappan phase (2600 BCE to 2000 BCE) has been found here. Granary is made up of mud-bricks with a floor of ramped earth plastered with mud. It has 7 rectangular or square chambers. Significant traces of lime &amp; decomposed grass are found on the lower portion of the granary wall indicating that it can also be the storehouse of grains with lime used as insecticide &amp; grass used to prevent entry of moisture. Looking at the size, it appears to be a public granary or a private granary of elites.

====Tools ====
Hunting tools like copper hafts and fish hooks have been found here. Presence of various toys like mini wheels, miniature lids, sling balls, animal figurines indicates a prevalence of toy culture. Signs of flourishing trade can be seen by the excavation of stamps, jewellery and &#x27;chert&#x27; weights. Weights found here are similar to weights found at many other IVC sites confirming presence of standardised weight systems.

====Culture, clothing and worship====
Fire altars and apsidal structures were revealed in Rakhigarhi.

Cotton cloth traces preserved on silver or bronze objects were known from Rakhigarhi, Chanhudaro and Harappa. An impressive number of stamps seals were also found at this site.

==== Cemetery and burial sites ====
A cemetery of Mature Harappan period is discovered at Rakhigarhi, with eight graves found. Often brick covered grave pits had wooden coffin in one case. Different type of grave pits were undercut to form an earthen overhang and body was placed below this; and then top of grave was filled with bricks to form a roof structure over the grave.

So far 53 burial sites with 46 skeletons have been discovered. Anthropological examination done on 37 skeletons revealed 17 to be of adults, 8 to be of subadults while the age of 12 skeletons could not be verified. Sex detection of 17 skeletons was successful out of which 7 were male and 10 female skeletons. Most of the burials were typical burials with skeletons in a supine position. Atypical burials had skeletons in a prone position. Some graves are just pits while some are brick lined and contain pottery. Some of them also had votive pots with animal remains symbolising offerings to the dead. Bone remains of secondary burials were not charred hence ruling out the possibility of cremation practices. While these burials retained many of the Harappan features, group burials and prone position burials are distinct. Paleo-parasitical studies and DNA analysis to determine the lineage is being undertaken.

Parasite eggs which were once existed in the stomach of those buried were found in the burial sites along with human skeletons. Analysis of Human aDNA obtained from human bones as well as analysis of parasite and animal DNA will be done to assert origins of these people.

==== Skeleton finds ====
In April 2015, four 4,600-year-old complete human skeletons were excavated from mound RGR-7. These skeletons belonged to two male adults, one female adult (classified as &#x27;I6113&#x27;) and one child. Pottery with grains of food as well as shell bangles were found around these skeletons. 


Two of the skeletons, a man between 35 and 40 years old and women in early 20s, who died around the same time. They were found buried together side by side with men&#x27;s head facing the women. Their ceremonial burial indicates that they were not in illicit relationship and the lovebirds were likely married to each other. Pots found in their grave likely carried food and water as offering to the dead. The agate found near he collar bone of the male was likely part of a necklace. The male was tall and female was . Their skeleton had no abnormalities, injuries or sign of disease. They were both likely &quot;quite healthy&quot; at the time of their death.

Shinde et al. (2019) have carried out DNA-tests on a single skeleton. Results announced in September 2018, and a paper published in &quot;Cell Magazine&quot; in 2019, show that the DNA did not include any traces of steppe ancestry, which is in line with the Aryan migration theory, which says that Indo-Aryans migrated to India from the steppes after the Harappan civilisation had started to disintegrate. 

A total of 61 skeletons were found till 2016. As the skeletons were excavated scientifically without any contamination, archaeologists think that with the help of latest technology on these skeletons and DNA obtained, it is possible to determine how Harappans looked like 4500 years ago. The average height is estimated to have been for men and for women.

In 2024, the &#x27;Mound 7&#x27; of the excavation site, which encompasses an area of 3.5 sqkms, yielded 56 skeletons.

== Site conservation and development==

=== Endangered heritage site ===
In May 2012, the Global Heritage Fund declared Rakhigarhi one of the ten most endangered heritage sites in Asia facing the threat of irreparable loss and destruction due to development pressures, insufficient management and looting. A 2012 study by the Sunday Times found that the site is not being looked after; the iron boundary wall is broken, and villagers sell the artefacts they dig out of the site and parts of site are now being encroached by private houses. Due to the lack of site protection the site is being destroyed by soil erosion, encroachments, illegal sand lifting, theft of archaeological artefacts for illegal sale. It is a punishable crime to sell or buy artefacts found in the ancient sites. 80% of mound 6 – a residential site of Harappan Era and 7 which is a burial site where 4 human skeletons were recovered in 2015 have been destroyed due to cultivation and soil mining.

===Site encroachments===
Parts of mounds R4 and R5 have been encroached by the villagers who have built 152 houses. The ASI has only 83.5 acres of the 350-hectare site that entails 11 archaeological mounds, due to encroachments and pending court cases for the removal of the encroachments.

=== Site rehabilitation and preservation ===
In February 2020, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the site of Rakhigarhi would be developed as an iconic site. ASI has commenced the plan to remove encroachments from the site, including 152 houses on the R4 and R5 mounds. Villages, whose houses in the site will be removed, will be relocated and rehabilitated in the housing flats on another location.

=== Site museum and lake ===

Rakhigarhi, which is an Indus Valley civilisation site, also has a museum developed by the state government. There is also Haryana Rural Antique Museum 60 km away, which is maintained by CCS HAU in its Gandhi Bhawan, exhibits evolution of agriculture and vanishing antiques. Jahaj Kothi Museum, named after George Thomas, is located inside Firoz Shah Palace Complex and maintained by Archaeological Survey of India.

To develop Rakhigarhi as the global heritage, two johad (water bodies) across the road to museum are developed as lakes. The lake has been deepened by digging and traditional ghats with burji on the banks of lake have been constructed. A park is developed the spare land of the lake. A walking track around the lake, with shady trees and fruit trees, has been constructed for the tourists. The traditional ghats represent the past scenario when paleo-Drishadvati river use to flow through Rakhigarhi which had ghats for transporting goods for trade, via Lothal port and Dholavira, as far as Mesopotamia (ancient cities of Elam and Sumer).

<doc id="421184" wikidata="Q4745376" url="?curid=421184" title="Operation Claret">
<text>Claret was the code name given to operations conducted from about July 1964 until July 1966 from East Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah) across the border in Indonesian Kalimantan during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation. They were instigated by the Director of Borneo Operations (DOBOPS) Major General Walter Walker with the agreement of the British and Malaysian governments. Their purpose was to seize the initiative and put the Indonesians on the defensive instead of allowing Indonesian forces to be safely based in Kalimantan and attack when and where they chose. However, it was important not to cause the Indonesians to lose face and possibly escalate the conflict, or to enable Indonesia to present evidence of &#x27;imperialist aggression&#x27;, so Claret operations were highly classified and never publicised, although it seems that some British journalists were aware of what transpired. British casualties on Claret operations were publicly reported as being in East Malaysia.

These operations involved both special forces and infantry. Special forces were mostly reconnaissance patrols crossing the border from the Malaysian state of Sarawak or Sabah into Indonesian Kalimantan in order to find and monitor Indonesian forces who might attack Sarawak or Sabah. Conventional forces were tasked to act on this information and that from other sources to ambush or otherwise attack the Indonesians under a policy of &#x27;aggressive defence&#x27;. Such operations were to be &#x27;deniable&#x27; as they may have represented a violation of state sovereignty, however they were justified at the time as an instance of hot pursuit. Operation Claret was largely successful in gaining the initiative for the British Commonwealth forces, inflicting significant casualties on the Indonesians and keeping them on the defensive, before being suspended late in the war.

== Background ==

The border between East Malaysia and Kalimantan was not well defined and 22 Special Air Service reconnaissance patrols seem to have liberally interpreted its inexactitude from late 1963 or early 1964. From early 1964 Indonesian cross-border raids increased and the mixed attacks by ill-trained &#x27;volunteers&#x27; &#x27;advised&#x27; by Indonesian troops were replaced by an increasing numbers of raids comprising only Indonesian armed forces. This caused increasing concern to DOBOPS.

However, in July 1964 the new Labour government in London approved cross-border offensive operations to a depth of by both special forces and infantry under the code-name Claret. DOBOPS added additional conditions, seven &#x27;Golden Rules&#x27;:
* authorisation by DOBOPS for every operation,
* only trained and tested troops to be used,
* penetration depth to be limited, attacks only to thwart enemy offensive action, never retribution of casualties, civilian casualties never to be risked,
* no air support, except in extreme emergency,
* operations to be planned and rehearsed for at least two weeks,
* every operation to be planned and executed with maximum security, cover plans made, code names for each operation, soldiers sworn to secrecy no details to be discussed over radio or telephone, no id disks to be worn and no identifiable material to be left in Kalimantan,
* no soldiers to be captured alive or dead.

Claret operations were only publicly disclosed by Britain in 1974, whilst the Australian government did not officially acknowledge its involvement until 1996.

The number of Claret operations and their objectives is unclear. Weekly operational reports by brigade, higher headquarters and some units are available in UK National Archives. They do not identify any actions as specifically Claret. They outline &#x27;contacts&#x27; in a way that implies they took place in East Malaysia but provide a grid reference, from which those south of the border can be identified with the aid of a 1:50,000 scale map. However, the border is some long.

== Nature of Operations ==

The operations varied in size from 4 man special forces reconnaissance patrols to infantry fighting patrols in company strength, sometimes coordinated in a battalion operation. They included at least one &#x27;permanent&#x27; Claret task, an artillery position (gun and observation post) astride the border ridge with authority to fire at any identifiable Indonesian forces inside Indonesia. Infantry tasks included fighting patrols inside Indonesia looking for opportunity &#x27;contacts&#x27;, attacks on Indonesian positions and ambushing tracks and rivers.

Initially, apart from special forces, only Gurkha infantry were used in company strength, and a battalion could only have one operation at a time. As experience and the situation developed these changed, and the Golden Rules on preparation and rehearsal, and the definition of thwarting offensive action relaxed. So too was the need for &#x27;sworn secrecy&#x27;, if it ever existed, and an early ban on internal discussion of operations. In 1965 penetration limits were increased to in the wake of the Indonesian assault at the Battle of Plaman Mapu, and then . Small amphibious raids on the flanks by Special Boat Service were also authorised.

Infantry operations were usually, if not always, within artillery range. Their depth was also affected by the threat of interception while withdrawing, greater when the Indonesian troop density was higher as it was in the areas south of Kuching. Another constraint was the limited range of man-pack VHF radios A41 &amp; 42, (copies of AN/PRC 9 &amp; 10) and mountainous terrain in some areas. However, A510, an Australian made small HF radio using continuous wave (i.e. Morse code) was used in some areas and new A13 HF radios appeared in early 1966.

Intelligence for these operations came from several sources. These included SAS patrols, Border Scouts (many of whom had relatives in Kalimantan), information from locals gathered by Border Scouts, Military Intelligence Officers and Field Intelligence NCOs, and probably police Special Branch and others. SIGINT collection is unknown.

Infantry operations typically lasted 5 to 10 days. The fighting patrols had to be self-contained and carry all their ammunition and rations. Normal practice was to withdraw after a contact, but staying in the area often led to further ambushing opportunities. Ambushes were the most common tactic, often lasting several days. However, Indonesians did not usually move at night so ambushes could withdraw to a harbour position. Because aircraft were not allowed to fly across the border casualties had to be evacuated by foot until they were back across the border, except in the most extreme cases with personal authorisation by DOBOPS.

Fire support for Claret operations was mostly provided by artillery and, if the target was close to the border and in range, infantry mortars. These were sometimes moved to temporary positions in the border area. The mortars changed from 3-inch to 81 mm with double the range around the end of 1965. Aircraft were not allowed to cross the border. A UK or Australian frigate was the &#x27;guard ship&#x27; at Tawau at the eastern end of the border and an artillery amphibious observation party was available to control its fire, however it does not seem to have fired in support of Claret operations.

Artillery support was unconventional because there were significantly more infantry battalions than batteries so the normal direct support relationship was not possible everywhere. Secondly, almost all guns were deployed singly in company or platoon bases. These sections did their own technical fire control and responded directly to fire orders from observers. This meant that most Claret operations were supported by only a single gun, which in turn meant that each gun had far more than its standard scale of ammunition.

== Participants in Operations ==

The vast majority of Claret tasks were undertaken by British infantry units, including all Gurkha battalions. Special forces operations were undertaken by the British Special Air Service, Special Boat Sections, Guards Independent Parachute Company, Gurkha Independent Parachute Company, patrol companies of the Parachute Regiment (C Company 2nd and D Company 3rd Battalions), the Australian Special Air Service Regiment and the 1 Ranger Squadron, New Zealand Special Air Service. The reconnaissance and intelligence gathering activities of the Border Scouts, mostly trained by 22 SAS, are unclear (apart from their accompanying many infantry patrols). The extent to which Malaysian Army units undertook Claret operations is also unclear.

At peak artillery strength in 1965–1966 there were six batteries (two from the Royal Malaysian Artillery) of 105 mm Pack Howitzer, half a battery of 5.5-inch guns and a section of 4.2-inch mortars operated by men detached from the light air defence battery defending Kuching airport. Artillery observation parties accompanied most, if not all, infantry patrols and occasionally special forces ones.

The number of Claret operations by individual infantry units is also unclear. It is probably related to tour length, although from early 1966 frequency decreased as the political situation in Indonesia changed. Units stationed in Malaysia generally did tours of about 4 or 6 months in Borneo, and most British and Gurkha units did repeated tours. UK based units spent 12 months in Malaysia, including jungle training and about 10 months in Borneo in two different areas. It was British policy that units did not do repeat tours in the same area.

Generally units on their first tour were not allowed to undertake more audacious operations so those conducted in their first and only tour by 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment between May and July 1965 on the Sungei Koemba river, at Kindau and again at Babang may not have been representative of those by more experienced Gurkha and British battalions, even if there were successful.
An example of a more complex operation is one by 2 Royal Green Jackets in late 1965, with battalion tactical HQ on the border ridge. It involved one company swimming a river to get behind an enemy base, a second company ambushed the river, when the Indonesian mortars in the base opened fire on the ambush area they were engaged by the battalion&#x27;s mortars that had been brought forward. This caused some Indonesians to flee their base into the ambush by the first company.

An example of a straightforward Claret operation occurred at the end of 1965. Intelligence reports stated that an Indonesian patrol in about section strength used a particular track every week or 10 days. The Reconnaissance Platoon of the Gordon Highlanders (a battalion with some 10 months in Borneo) left a company base at Long Pa Sia in the 4th Division of Sarawak, established an ambush, which was sprung after several days leaving some 5 Indonesians killed. The platoon withdrew without interference.

However, Claret operations did not always go to plan. In late 1965 intelligence reported the existence of a previously unknown base in the estuarine area west of Tawau at the eastern end of the Border. The Reconnaissance Platoon of the Scots Guards, well into their second tour, conducted an operation to ascertain whether the base was in use and exploit any opportunities that arose. They found the base empty, and leaving 4 men there, started reconnoitering the surrounding area. The base&#x27;s owners, a company of Indonesian marines (KKO), returned and there was immediate contact. The rest of the platoon returned, reunited and conducted a fighting withdrawal. Over 350 rounds were fired by the single gun in the company base at Serudong Laut, which entailed the entire company there unpacking and moving ammunition to the gun.

The last Claret operation was in July 1966 as a riposte to the raid towards Brunei by Lt Sumbi of 600 Raider Company and &#x27;volunteers&#x27; in May. This operation was an artillery ambush from Ba Kelalan in the 5th Division of Sarawak by 1/7 Gurkhas and 38 Light Battery on a track leading to the Long Bawang airfield.

<doc id="421185" wikidata="Q1265955" url="?curid=421185" title="American dusky flycatcher">
<text>The American dusky flycatcher (Empidonax oberholseri), or simply dusky flycatcher, is a small insectivorous passerine of the tyrant flycatcher family.

The dusky flycatcher is one of many species in the genus &quot;Empidonax&quot;. These species are very similar in appearance and behavior, and they are notoriously difficult to differentiate. The best characteristics for distinguishing these species are voice, breeding habitat, and range.

==Description==
Adults have olive-gray upperparts, darker on the wings and tail, with whitish underparts; they have a noticeable medium-width white eye ring, white wing bars and a medium length tail. The breast is washed with olive-gray. The bill is mainly dark. It is a bit smaller than the American grey flycatcher and a bit larger than the Hammond&#x27;s flycatcher.

===Vocalizations===
The male sings a three-part song. A common call is a dry &quot;whit&quot;, similar to that of other &quot;Empidonax&quot; flycatchers. A less common call, that is possibly only given by the male, is a sad &quot;dew-hic&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The scientific name commemorates the American ornithologist Harry Church Oberholser.

==Distribution==
These birds migrate to southern Arizona and Mexico. As non-breeding residents in the south of their migration range, they are passage migrants over the deserts of the south-western United States, the Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan Deserts, where they make their stops along the flyway.

==Habitat==
Their breeding habitat is mountain slopes and foothills with brush and scattered trees (especially ponderosa pine) across western North America. They make a cup nest low in a vertical fork in a shrub.

==Behavior==
They often wait on an open perch and fly out to catch insects in flight (hawking), and will also pluck insects from foliage while hovering (gleaning).

<text>Spearhead was a British far-right magazine edited by John Tyndall until his death in July 2005. Founded in 1964 by Tyndall, it was used to voice his grievances against the state of the United Kingdom. The magazine has not continued under new editorship, although a new article appeared on the magazine&#x27;s website in October 2010.

== History ==
From 1967 to 1980, &quot;Spearhead&quot; served as the official mouthpiece of the National Front, mirroring its editor&#x27;s involvement in this organisation. Opponents of its editor&#x27;s political views regard it as an outlet for racist and neo-Nazi material, although Tyndall himself denied these accusations.

While Tyndall was leader of the British National Party, he used the magazine as a platform for promoting the policies of the BNP. When he lost the leadership election to Nick Griffin he started to use it to attack the current BNP leadership. In the light of this, along with the very much more &#x27;hardline&#x27; opinions carried by the publication, which were not considered to be in line with current BNP thinking, the BNP consequently decided to prohibit the sale of &quot;Spearhead&quot; at BNP meetings. Tyndall was also expelled for related reasons, although he was later readmitted following an out-of-court settlement with the party. He was subsequently expelled again before his death.

A former editor of the magazine (of which &quot;Spearhead&quot; had several, in addition to Tyndall himself), until Tyndall&#x27;s split-off in 1980, was Richard Verrall, a noted Holocaust denier, and then National Front ideologue.

The magazine had a limited circulation and was not easily obtainable in most British newsagents, and most public libraries refused to accept copies because of what was generally felt to be the racist tone of the publication. It was largely distributed by mail order subscription, and it had and still has a considerable Internet presence, with many of its articles being published on the magazine&#x27;s website. This is still online, with a new article appearing on the site in October 2010. The site also contains a catalogue of books considered to be relevant to the magazine&#x27;s themes and ideas; although many of these books contain far-right content, often taking the form of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, there are some more surprising entries, such as George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; and Greg Palast&#x27;s &quot;The Best Democracy Money Can Buy&quot;. There are also many books promoting Social Credit, two books by David Icke and three by Richard Body.

In July 2010, &quot;Spearhead&quot; made a return as a bi-monthly magazine of the National Front although Valerie Tyndall, Tyndall&#x27;s wife, made a complaint on the &quot;Spearhead&quot; archive website that the return of &quot;Spearhead&quot; has been made in the interests of a former foe of Tyndall, Erik Ericksson, and that it was not in the interest of Tyndall to have &quot;Spearhead&quot; in continuation after his death. Valerie also claimed that &quot;Erik Ericksson&quot; was the nom de plume of Eddy Morrison.

<text>Operation Claymore was a British/Norwegian commando raid on the Lofoten Islands of northern Norway during the Second World War. The Lofoten Islands were an important centre for the production of fish oil and glycerine, used in the German war economy. The landings were carried out on 4 March 1941, by 500 men of No. 3 Commando, No. 4 Commando, and a Royal Engineers section, and 52 men from Norwegian Independent Company 1. Supported by the 6th Destroyer Flotilla and two troop transports of the Royal Navy, the force landed almost unopposed. The original plan was to avoid contact with German forces and inflict the maximum of damage to German-controlled industry. They achieved their objective of destroying fish oil factories and some of oil and glycerine. The force returned with some 228 German prisoners, 314 Norwegian recruits, and a number of Quisling regime collaborators.

Through naval gunfire and demolition parties, 18,000 tons of shipping were sunk. Perhaps the most significant outcome of the raid was the capture of a set of rotor wheels for an Enigma machine and its code books from the German armed trawler &quot;Krebs&quot;. German naval codes could thereafter be deciphered at Bletchley Park, providing the intelligence needed to allow Allied convoys to avoid U-boat concentrations. In the aftermath, the evaluation of the operation differed, with the British, especially Winston Churchill and the Special Operations Executive, deeming it a success. In the eyes of the British, the main value of such actions was to tie up large German forces in occupation duties in Norway. Martin Linge and the other Norwegians involved were more doubtful of the value of such raids on the Norwegian coast, but were not told of the value of the seized cryptographic information. Ongoing analysis of period documents suggests that commando raids of this type were a &#x27;cover&#x27; for so-called &quot;pinch raids&quot; designed to capture German cryptographic equipment without the enemy realizing that was the true purpose of the raids.

== Background ==
After the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had been expelled from Europe at the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill called for a force to be assembled and equipped to inflict casualties on the Germans and bolster British morale. Churchill told the joint chiefs of staff to propose measures for an offensive against German-occupied Europe and stated that &quot;... they must be prepared with specially trained troops of the hunter class who can develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast&quot;. Lieutenant-Colonel Dudley Clarke had already submitted such a proposal to General Sir John Dill, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. Dill, aware of Churchill&#x27;s intentions, approved Clarke&#x27;s proposal. Three weeks later, the first commando raid—Operation Collar—took place. The raiders failed to gather any intelligence or damage any German equipment; their only success was in killing two German sentries.

The commandos came under the operational control of the Combined Operations Headquarters. The man initially selected as the commander was Admiral Roger Keyes, a veteran of the Gallipoli Campaign and the Zeebrugge Raid in the First World War. In 1940, the call went out for volunteers from among the serving Army soldiers within certain formations still in Britain and men of the disbanding divisional Independent Companies, originally raised from Territorial Army divisions, which had seen service in Norway. In November 1940, the new army units were organised into a special service brigade under Brigadier J.C. Haydon, with four special service battalions. By the autumn of 1940, more than 2,000 men had volunteered for commando training and the special service brigade now consisted of 12 units which were called commandos.

After an inauspicious start, the first large-scale commando raid was to be on the Lofoten Islands just off the Norwegian coast, inside the Arctic Circle, about from Britain. Once at the islands, the raiders would be landed at four small ports to destroy fish oil-producing factories. All the oil produced was being shipped to Germany, which extracted the glycerine, a vital ingredient in the manufacture of high explosives. The commandos would be transported to the islands aboard two new infantry landing ships, escorted by four and one L-class destroyer of the 6th Destroyer Flotilla.

==Mission==

The commander of the raid was Rear Admiral Louis Keppel Hamilton. The objectives of Operation Claymore were threefold. The Royal Navy were asked to safely escort the transports carrying the landing force to the islands and back. While there, they were to destroy or capture any German shipping or Norwegian shipping working for the Germans and provide naval gunfire support for the landing forces. The naval forces taking part were the escorts from the 6th Destroyer Flotilla: , , , and under the command of Captain C. Caslon. Two newly converted landing ships, and , were to transport the landing force.

The landing force was provided by the special service brigade (Brigadier J. C. Haydon). The commandos taking part were 250 all ranks from No. 3 Commando (Major John Durnford-Slater), and 250 all ranks of No. 4 Commando (Lieutenant Colonel D. S. Lister). They were supported by a section of Royal Engineers of No. 55 Field Company, (Second Lieutenant H. M. Turner) and four officers and 48 other ranks of the Norwegian Independent Company 1, (Captain Martin Linge). The landing force were to destroy the oil-producing facilities in the ports of Stamsund, Henningsvær, Svolvær and Brettesnes, engage the German garrison and attempt to take prisoners of war found in the area. They were also to detain any supporters of the Norwegian Quisling party and persuade the local population to leave the island and join the Free Norwegian Forces.

The force began its assembly at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands on 21 February 1941 and remained there for almost a week, before leaving for Norway just after midnight on 1 March 1941. The landing force was distributed amongst the ships, headquarters special service brigade were transported on &quot;Somali&quot;. No. 4 Commando which had been assigned landings at Svolvær and Brettesnes were on board &quot;Queen Emma&quot;. No. 3 Commando, which had been assigned landings at Stamsund and Henningsvær, were on board &quot;Princess Beatrix&quot;. The Royal Engineers and Norwegian forces were divided between both the landing ships.

The time they had spent at Scapa Flow was used getting acquainted with the transport ships and the Landing Craft Assault they would be using to reach the shore. The problems the navy perceived providing gunfire support were also discussed, as the destroyers would not be able to approach closer than to shore owing to the shallows. Because of this, the commandos were trained to rely on their own weapons to provide covering fire and support each other from their landing craft. Plans were also made for them to look after themselves in case the destroyers were called away to deal with a naval threat, which included every man being ordered to take enough rations to last for 48 hours ashore.

==Landings==

The naval task force known by the codename &quot;Rebel&quot; left Scapa Flow and headed towards the Faroes. They berthed in the Skálafjørður at 19:00 hours 1 March 1941 to take on fuel. Refuelling took five hours and the naval task force headed north towards the Arctic to avoid detection by German air and sea patrols. They then turned east and headed towards Norway. They arrived at the Lofoten Islands just before 04:00 hours on 4 March 1941. Upon entering the Vestfjorden found the harbour&#x27;s navigational lights illuminated, which they took as a sign they had achieved surprise.

The original plan was for simultaneous landings at 06:30 hours, but upon arrival this was postponed by 15 minutes to avoid landing in darkness. All commandos were ashore by 06:50 hours. The attack was largely unopposed apart from four rounds fired by the German armed trawler &quot;Krebs&quot; at HMS &quot;Somali&quot; before she was sunk. Damage and civilian casualties occurred as sank the Norwegian passenger ship &quot;D/S Mira&quot;, which entered the scene of the action. The landing forces sank the merchant ships &quot;Hamburg&quot;, &quot;Pasajes&quot;, &quot;Felix&quot;, &quot;Eilenau&quot;, &quot;Rissen&quot;, &quot;Andø&quot;, &quot;Grotto&quot;, and , which amounted to 18,000 tons.

The force that landed at Stamsund destroyed the Lofotens Cod Boiling Plant. Two factories were destroyed at Henningsvær and 13 at Svolvær. In total, about of fish oil and paraffin were set on fire. The soldiers captured 228 prisoners - including seven from the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, three from the &quot;Heer&quot;, 15 from the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, two from the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot;, 147 from the Merchant Navy and 14 civilians.
Perhaps the most significant result of the raid was the capture of a set of rotor wheels for an Enigma cypher machine, and its code books. These were rescued from the sinking &quot;Krebs&quot;, although her commander, Lieutenant Hans Kupfinger, threw his machine (one of three known to be on the island) overboard minutes before he was killed. Captured documents showed the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; Home Waters key for February and also helped solve the April traffic which was sent between 1 March and 10 May.

Their capture enabled Bletchley Park to read all German naval codes for some time and provided the intelligence needed to allow Allied convoys to avoid U-boat concentrations. By 13:00 hours, both the infantry landing ships &quot;Princess Beatrix&quot; and &quot;Queen Emma&quot; had embarked all their troops and were ready to sail. With them came 300 volunteers for the Free Norwegian Forces in Britain.

== Aftermath ==
After the raid, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill issued a memo &quot;to all concerned... my congratulations on the very satisfactory operation&quot;. Claymore was the first of 12 commando raids directed against Norway during the Second World War. The Germans eventually increased the number of troops in Norway and by 1944, the German garrison was 370,000 men strong (a standard British infantry division in 1944 had 18,347 men). No. 3 and No. 4 Commandos became part of the 1st Special Service Brigade and took part in the Normandy landings in June 1944.

<text>According to the 2021 Romanian census, 2,137 Poles live in Romania, mainly in the villages of Suceava County (). There are three exclusively Polish villages, as follows: &quot;Nowy Sołoniec&quot; (Solonețu Nou), &quot;Plesza&quot; (Pleșa), and &quot;Pojana Mikuli&quot; (Poiana Micului), as well a significant Polish presence in &quot;Kaczyca&quot; (Cacica) and &quot;Paltynosa&quot; (Păltinoasa). There is also a relatively sizable number of ethnic Poles living in the county seat, Suceava ().

Poles in Romania form an officially recognised national minority, having one seat in the Chamber of Deputies (currently held by the Union of Poles of Romania) and access to Polish elementary schools and cultural centres (known as &quot;Polish Houses&quot; or &quot;Dom Polski&quot; in Polish).

== History ==

The first Poles settled in Moldavia in the times of Casimir III (specifically during the Late Middle Ages). Most of the Poles immigrating after 1774 were looking for work. So it was that Polish miners from Bochnia and Wieliczka were brought to salt mines in Cacica.

Another wave of Polish immigration arrived in Bukovina in the early 19th century, when the region was a crownland of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, as was a significant portion of present-day southern Poland (see: Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria).

Around 1803, Polish highlanders from Čadca () settled in &quot;Treblecz&quot; (Tereblecea, now in Chernivtsi Raion, Chernivtsi Oblast, Ukraine) by Siret, in &quot;Stara Huta Krasna&quot; and in &quot;Kaliczanka&quot; and again in 1814 to 1819, this time settling in &quot;Hliboka&quot; (Adâncata) and &quot;Tereszna&quot;. Nowy Sołoniec was settled in 1834, Plesza in 1835, and Pojana Mikuli in 1842.

At that time, it must be mentioned that Bukovina was a very attractive region of the Austrian Empire to live in thanks to Austria&#x27;s policy not to conscript recruits into its army from there (service in the Austrian army at that time was for a 14-year term).

Furthermore, Bukovina was free from serfdom, primarily attracting immigrants of German (who later formed the basis of the Bukovina German community of the region), Jewish, and also Czecho-Slovak origin but also Polish ethnicity and even Russian and Italian.

There were probably other waves of migration from Poland after the November and Kraków Uprisings, but most Poles were from peasant families relocated there by the Empire&#x27;s authorities after they participated in the Jakub Szela insurrection.

During World War I, Lucjan Skupiewski, Polish physician born in Warsaw, was the organizer and manager of all hospitals for the wounded in the Bucharest area. After the war, he stayed in Romania, and was the deputy deputy mayor of Bucharest and senator for the Polish minority.
Following the restoration of independent Poland, since 1919, many Poles left Bukovina for Poland. Four Polish newspapers were issued in Romania in the interbellum (&quot;Gazeta Polska&quot;, &quot;Głos Ludu&quot;, &quot;Głos Prawdy&quot;, &quot;Kurier Polski w Rumunii&quot;). The largest urban concentrations of Poles in Romania were Cernăuți (with 8,986 people), Bucharest (1,650), Chișinău (1,436), Sadagura (1,333), Storojineț (1,017) and Bălți (981), according to the 1930 Romanian census. The Polonia Cernăuți Polish football club was active in Cernăuți, and was one of the top teams in the region of Bukovina, winning several regional championships and reaching the quarterfinals of the national Romanian championships three times.

During World War II, a portion of northern and eastern Romania was annexed by the Soviet Union, including the Cernăuți, Storojineț and Bălți counties, which were home to sizeable Polish populations of 15,243, 7,985 and 3,165 people, respectively, according to the 1930 Romanian census. After the war, many Poles from the sizeable Polish communities in Bukovina and Lupeni were repatriated to Poland.

<doc id="421235" wikidata="Q1151761" url="?curid=421235" title="The Adventure of Silver Blaze">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of Silver Blaze&quot;, one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is the first from the 12 in the cycle collected as &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in December 1892.

Doyle considered &quot;Silver Blaze&quot; among his favourite Sherlock Holmes stories. One of the most popular Sherlock Holmes short stories, &quot;Silver Blaze&quot; focuses on the disappearance of the eponymous race horse (a famous winner, owned by a Colonel Ross) on the eve of an important race and on the apparent murder of its trainer. The tale is distinguished by its atmospheric Dartmoor setting and late-Victorian sporting milieu. The plotting hinges on the &quot;curious incident of the dog in the night-time&quot;:

==Plot==

Sherlock Holmes and his partner Dr. Watson travel by train to Dartmoor to investigate a crime of disappearance of the great race horse Silver Blaze and the murder of the horse&#x27;s trainer, John Straker. Holmes and Watson arrive at King&#x27;s Pyland, from where Silver Blaze is missing. Bookmaker Fitzroy Simpson had come to Dartmoor (and specifically to King&#x27;s Pyland) to gather information about Silver Blaze and his stablemate Bayard. He had approached both Straker&#x27;s maid and a stable boy the night of the horse&#x27;s disappearance and has been arrested for the murder. To Holmes, there seem to be a number of facts that do not fit the case against Simpson, damning as it looks. It seems odd that he would lead the horse out on to the moor simply to injure or kill him, which could be done in his stall. He could not have stolen the animal, what good would such a famous thoroughbred be to him? Why has an exhaustive search of the neighbourhood not turned up Silver Blaze? What has Simpson done with him?

Sherlock Holmes soon tracks down Silver Blaze; his tracks (along with a man&#x27;s) are clearly visible in the soil, albeit intermittently. Holmes also deduces why the police could not find the horse, despite having looked right at him. Holmes ensures Silver Blaze&#x27;s safety, and turns his mind to other aspects of the case.

John Straker, Silver Blaze&#x27;s late trainer, has been killed by a blow to the skull, assumed to have been administered by Simpson with his &quot;Penang lawyer&quot;, a club-like walking stick. Simpson&#x27;s cravat is also found in Straker&#x27;s hand, and the latter&#x27;s coat is found draped over a furze bush. A knife is found at the crime scene—a peculiarly delicate-looking one, with a small blade. Dr. Watson, from his medical experience, identifies it as a cataract knife used for the most delicate surgery—useful as it is for that purpose, it would be unsuitable as a weapon. Straker also seems to have gashed himself in the hip with it.
One of the stable lads, Ned Hunter, was on guard duty the night of the crime but he proves to have been drugged with powdered opium placed in his supper. No one else who ate the curried mutton made at the Strakers&#x27; house that evening suffered any ill effects but Hunter was in a profound stupor well into the next day. Straker&#x27;s pockets contained a tallow candle and a milliner&#x27;s bill for (among other things) a 22-guinea dress, made out to one William Derbyshire. There is the curious incident with the dog, and a problem with the sheep kept at the stable: a shepherd tells Holmes that three of his animals have become suddenly lame.

Holmes&#x27;s powers unravel the mystery and lay bare what villainies there are to be exposed. He visits the milliners&#x27; shop in London and determines, using Straker&#x27;s photograph, that Straker posed as Derbyshire. This establishes his motive: he had a mistress with expensive tastes and tried to rig the race to earn himself a large sum of money. The curried mutton was a clue; only such a spicy dish could have masked the taste of powdered opium and it was impossible for Simpson to arrange a highly seasoned meal that evening for his purposes. Therefore, someone in the household must have conceived the idea, namely Straker.

The &quot;curious incident of the dog in the night-time&quot; is easily explained: the dog made no noise because no stranger was there. Holmes explains, &quot;I had grasped the significance of the silence of the dog, for one true inference invariably suggests others... Obviously the midnight visitor was someone whom the dog knew well&quot;. It was Straker who removed Silver Blaze from his stall and led him out on to the moor. Straker&#x27;s purpose in doing this was to use the cataract knife to inflict a slight injury upon one of the horse&#x27;s legs, rendering him temporarily lame in a way that would be undetectable on examination and thus likely put down to strain. He had thought to use Simpson&#x27;s cravat (which the latter dropped when he was expelled from King&#x27;s Pyland) as a sling to hold the horse&#x27;s leg to cut it. Straker was killed when the horse, sensing that something was wrong, panicked and kicked the trainer in the head. The lame sheep had been used by Straker for practice.
Colonel Ross&#x27;s main concern, of course, is getting his horse back. Holmes chooses not to tell Ross where his horse has been (although he has known all along) until after the Wessex Cup, which is won by Silver Blaze. At first the Colonel does not recognise his horse, since the animal&#x27;s distinguishing white markings have been covered with dye. The horse had been looked after by one of the Colonel&#x27;s neighbours, Silas Brown, who had found him wandering the moor and hidden him in his barn. Holmes then explains the details of the case step-by-step to the satisfaction of the Colonel, Watson and Inspector Gregory.

Gregory is one of the more competent police detectives Holmes works with in the course of his career. He conducts a thorough investigation of the crime before Holmes&#x27;s arrival and gathers all the evidence Holmes needs to solve the case. Holmes notes that Gregory is &quot;an extremely good officer&quot; and observes that the only quality he lacks is imagination—the ability to imagine what might have happened and act on this intuition.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventure of Silver Blaze&quot; was published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in December 1892, and in the United States in the US edition of the &quot;Strand&quot; in January 1893. It was also published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; (US) on 25 February 1893. The story was published with nine illustrations by Sidney Paget in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;, and with two illustrations by W. H. Hyde in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in December 1893 in the UK and February 1894 in the US.

==Adaptations==

===Film and television===
One of the short films in the Sherlock Holmes Éclair film series (1912) was based on the story. Georges Tréville played Sherlock Holmes in the film series.

A short film adaptation was released in 1923 starring Eille Norwood in the role of Holmes and Hubert Willis cast as Dr Watson. This was part of the 1921–1923 Sherlock Holmes Stoll film series, specifically the set of films released in 1923 under the series title &quot;The Last Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

In 1937, the British film &quot;Silver Blaze&quot; was released starring Arthur Wontner as Holmes and Ian Fleming as Watson. The film was released in the U.S. four years later as &quot;Murder at the Baskervilles&quot;.

The story was adapted as the 1977 television film &quot;Silver Blaze&quot; starring Christopher Plummer as Holmes and Thorley Walters as Watson.

The story was adapted in 1988 for Granada television&#x27;s &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Jeremy Brett as Holmes and Edward Hardwicke as Watson.

An episode of the animated television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century&quot; was based on the story. The episode, titled &quot;Silver Blaze&quot;, first aired in 1999.

In &quot;Elementary&quot;, season 2, episode 7 &quot;The Marchioness&quot;, used elements from &quot;Silver Blaze&quot; in the plot.

===Radio and audio dramas===

&quot;Silver Blaze&quot; was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. The episode aired on 8 December 1930. Other episodes adapted from the story aired in May 1935 (with Louis Hector as Holmes and Lovell as Watson) and in April 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson). Meiser also adapted the story for &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; for a 1939 episode with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. It was also dramatised as a 1943 episode of the series.

A radio dramatisation of the story aired on British radio in 1938, titled &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of Silver Blaze&quot;. A different adaptation of the story aired on the BBC Home Service in 1945 with Laidman Browne as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. A radio adaptation starring John Gielgud as Holmes and Ralph Richardson as Watson aired on NBC radio in March 1955.

A 1962 dramatisation of &quot;Silver Blaze&quot; aired on the BBC Light Programme, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. Another adaptation aired on British radio in 1978, starring Barry Foster as Holmes and David Buck as Watson.

&quot;Silver Blaze&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1992 by Bert Coules as an episode of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Jack May as Colonel Ross, Susan Sheridan as Mrs Straker, Brett Usher as Silas Brown, Terence Edmond as Inspector Gregory, and Petra Markham as Edith.

A 2014 episode of the radio series &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; was adapted from the story, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

In 2024, the podcast Sherlock&amp;Co adapted the story in a four-episodes adventure called &quot;Silver Blaze&quot;, starring Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

===Other===
In 1966, jigsaw manufacturer Springbok released a circular puzzle called &quot;Silver Blaze - From the Memories of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The goal was to solve the mystery using an enclosed story booklet combined with scenes depicted in the puzzle. A sealed solution was also included.

==Cultural impact==

The title of Mark Haddon&#x27;s award-winning novel &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot; is taken from a remark made by Sherlock Holmes in &quot;Silver Blaze&quot;. The protagonist of this novel, Christopher John Francis Boone, mentions Sherlock Holmes several times.

In the study of phase transitions in physics, the &quot;Silver Blaze property&quot; is where an order parameter describing the transition is precisely zero at temperatures or chemical potentials below the phase transition, becoming nonzero only at the transition. The name was chosen because of the analogy between the order parameter and the curious incident of the dog doing nothing in the night time, which provides Holmes with an essential clue.

<text>The Socialist Workers Party in Greece (Greek: Σοσιαλιστικό Εργατικό Κόμμα, ΣΕΚ; translit. &quot;Sosialistikó Ergatikó Kómma&quot;, SEK) is an affiliate of the International Socialist Tendency (IST). It is the second largest organisation in IST after the British Socialist Workers Party.

== History ==
SEK originated among a group of exiled Greek students in London, led by Maria Styllou and Panos Garganas, and a group of Greek students during the occupations of universities against the Greek dictatorship. In the beginning they organised themselves as the Socialist Revolution Organisation (OSE). While in London they developed relations with the International Socialists led by Tony Cliff and were won to the politics of the IST.

In the early 1980s, the OSE developed closer links with the IST, grew fairly rapidly and in 1997 changed their name to the Socialist Workers Party. In 2001 a minority left to form the Internationalist Workers Left (DEA) organisation. SEK publishes a weekly newspaper, &quot;Workers Solidarity&quot; (Εργατική Αλληλεγγύη), and a bi-monthly magazine, &quot;Socialism from Below&quot; (Σοσιαλισμός από τα Κάτω).

The SEK is active in a number of organisations, including the Greek &quot;Stop the War Coalition&quot;, &quot;United Against Racism and the threat of Fascism&quot;.

In the 2006 Greek local elections for Athens-Piraeus Super Prefecture, the SEK supported candidates under the banner &quot;Συμμαχία για την Υπερνομαρχία&quot; (Symmachia gia tin Ypernomarchia = Union for the Super Prefecture) which took 1.32%.

In October 2023, SEK released a statement declaring their support for Palestine in the 2023 Israel–Hamas war.

<text>During World War II, Operation Cold Comfort was a failed SAS raid that began with a parachute drop north of Verona on 17 February 1945. It was later renamed Zombie. 

The 12 man ski team under Capt. Littlejohn, and their equipment were widely scattered in the drop, and thereafter found themselves among hostile locals of essentially German origin. Their mission was to block by landslide the main rail lines through the Brenner Pass, thus having a dramatic effect on German reinforcements moving south.

The men spent most of their time in hiding and attempts to supply and reinforce by air were unsuccessful. Capt. Littlejohn and Corporal Crowley were captured and executed under Hitler’s Commando Order. Eventually on 31 March the situation had worsened to the point exfiltration was ordered.

<doc id="421244" wikidata="Q6509041" url="?curid=421244" title="League of Empire Loyalists">
<text>The League of Empire Loyalists (LEL) was a British pressure group (also called a &quot;ginger group&quot; in Britain and the Commonwealth of Nations), established in 1954. Its ostensible purpose was to stop the British Empire&#x27;s dissolution. The League was a small group of current or former members of the Conservative Party led by Arthur K. Chesterton, a former leading figure in the British Union of Fascists, who had served under Sir Oswald Mosley. The League found support from some Conservative Party members, although most of the Conservative leadership disliked it.

==Formation==
Chesterton established the group in 1954 on the far right of the Conservative Party, effectively as a reaction to the more liberal forms of Toryism in evidence at the time, as typified by the policies of R. A. Butler. Chesterton feared the growth of the Soviet Union and of the United States. He concluded that Bolshevism and American-style capitalism were actually in an alliance as part of a Jewish-led conspiracy against the British Empire, a mindset that informed the LEL from the beginning.

The wide-reaching critiques that this conspiracy theory utilised meant that the LEL won membership from various sectors of right-wing opinion, including former BUF activists like Chesterton himself and Barry Domvile, traditionalist patriots like General Richard Hilton and young radicals like John Tyndall, John Bean, Colin Jordan and Martin Webster. Indeed, in its early years, the LEL succeeded in attracting some leading members of the establishment to its ranks, including Field-Marshal Edmund Ironside, 1st Baron Ironside, Lieutenant-General Sir Balfour Oliphant Hutchison and the former British People&#x27;s Party election candidate Air Commodore G. S. Oddie.

Although the LEL actively supported an independent candidate who was a member at the 1957 Lewisham North by-election, it was not a political party. According to Nigel Fielding, the LEL &quot;was composed of right-wing Conservatives, particularly retired military men, and a few pre-war Fascists&quot;.

==Stunts==
The LEL was well known for various stunts at Conservative Party meetings and conferences (acting as a constant irritant to the party). These stunts included hiding underneath the speaker platform overnight to emerge during the conference in order to put across their points. At the 1958 party Conference in Blackpool, George Irvine Finlay (who became Director of Organisation for the Scottish Conservatives) was involved in forcibly removing members of the League of Empire Loyalists. The widespread media coverage resulted in his being sued for assault; not only was he acquitted, but costs were awarded against the prosecution. That same year the League secured further publicity when members launched an &quot;invasion&quot; of the Lambeth Conference of the Anglican Communion.

In another incident, LEL member Austen Brooks gained access to a lunch for U Thant by impersonating Cypriot Archbishop Makarios III, both men being heavily bearded, before revealing his charade and shouting LEL slogans. Sir Anthony Eden was also a target and when he shook hands with Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin as they arrived at Victoria Station in 1956, LEL members were on hand to yell at Eden that he had just shaken hands with murderers. In November 1961, Leonard Young, a Royal Air Force Wing Commander and author of the 1956 book &quot;Deadlier Than the H-Bomb&quot;, gained further notoriety for the LEL when he threw a bag of sheep guts at the President of Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta. The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament was also a target when speakers at its inaugural rally in Central Hall, Westminster, on 17 February 1958 were heckled, in particular Michael Foot. After these antics, the Tory leadership made it clear to their members that the LEL was to be discouraged, leading to a severe downturn in membership.

==Policies==
As its name suggests, the initial aim of the LEL was to support the British Empire and to campaign for its continuing existence. It was to be its calls for the restoration of the empire and reassertion of the notion of Britons as the world&#x27;s natural leaders that ultimately saw the group become estranged from the Conservatives, as the League was increasingly divorced from the one nation conservatism that came to dominate the party. This was particularly true following the independence of Sudan and the Suez Crisis in 1956 when the Conservatives formally broke from any notion of being the party of empire.

As time progressed, the group became primarily concerned with opposing non-white immigration into Britain and were instrumental in the founding (with other right-wing and neo-Nazi groups) of the National Front in February 1967. Chesterton&#x27;s personal anti-Semitism and devotion to conspiracy theories about the Jews and international capitalism also became more prominent in LEL ideology towards the end of the group&#x27;s life. The League was also strongly anti-communist and had close links with emigre groups such as the Ukrainian National Committee.

==Decline and splits==
By 1961, the LEL found itself in financial trouble, and Chesterton was funding the group himself. The group had also lost many of its members, falling from a 1958 high of 3000 to only 300 members. Some had left with Hilton to join his Patriotic Party whilst another group of leavers had been the supporters of Colin Jordan. Jordan had left in 1957 after his call to bar Jews, and non-whites from the LEL had been rejected, whilst John Bean had left under acrimonious circumstances the following year. Both men advocated the formation of mass parties, an idea that Chesterton rejected, and over time they won support to their respective groups, the White Defence League and the National Labour Party by advocating these and other more radical ideas.

By the mid-1960s, the LEL was a shadow of its former self as, according to leading member Rodney Legg, it had come to be seen as archaic and anachronistic whilst it was struggling even more with a lack of funds. By 1964, Chesterton was already being heard to say in private that the future of the LEL might be better served by joining up with the younger, more radical members who had departed earlier in the decade. In an attempt to reinvigorate the flagging group Chesterton was persuaded to put up three &quot;Independent Loyalist&quot; candidates in the 1964 General Election, but between them, they managed to secure only 1064 votes According to Michael Billig, the League only contested these seats as a publicity stunt rather than due to having any pretensions to becoming a political party.
The League&#x27;s journal &quot;Candour&quot; went on to support the National Front while A. K. Chesterton was its leader. Following that, it became independent and is still published to this day.

==Creation of the National Front==
Despite the poor performances of the three candidates, donations had poured in from all over the country to help them fight the campaign. This made a deep impression on Chesterton, who had largely been obliged to fund the LEL out of his own pocket. Chesterton had been preoccupied with a legal case over the estate of his financial benefactor, the Chile-based millionaire Robert K. Jeffrey, who had seemingly left two contradictory wills, but Chesterton&#x27;s fervour for politics had been rekindled by his discovery of the relative ease of funding a political party and by the emergence of Edward Martell, a right-wing libertarian who had garnered a reputation as an excellent fund-raiser and whose methods, if not politics, had impressed Chesterton greatly. By the spring of 1966, Chesterton had begun sounding out the likes of Bean, Tyndall and even Jordan about the possibility of building a united front on the far right.

Chesterton&#x27;s mood was dampened somewhat by the 1966 general election in which the Labour Party won a convincing victory and anti-immigration candidates lost support, as well as by Rhodesia&#x27;s exit from the Commonwealth following its Unilateral Declaration of Independence. However, it also convinced him that space had opened to the right of the Conservative Party and that the chances were better for a united far-right group. The LEL, however, was under threat from the growth of the Racial Preservation Society and of the Monday Club, making the need for a new party that much more urgent. Around this time, he flirted with Dr David Brown of the Racial Preservation Society and his plans to establish a National Democratic Party, but he backed away when Brown insisted that the LEL would effectively be turned over to RPS control in this arrangement.

Discussions with the British National Party (BNP) began in earnest in September 1966, and by the time of the LEL conference the following month, plans were already at such an advanced stage that the major topic was whether the new party would be called the British Front or the National Independence Party. The conference also saw the establishment of a working party to thrash out details of the new group, consisting of Austen Brooks, Rosine de Bounevialle, Avril Walters and Nettie Bonner from the LEL and Philip Maxwell, Bernard Simmons and Gerald Kemp from the BNP. On 7 February 1967 the LEL was wound up and replaced by the newly merged group, by now known as the National Front.

<text>JCPenney (colloquially Penney&#x27;s and abbreviated JCP) is an American department store chain with 656 stores across 49 U.S. states and Puerto Rico. It is managed as part of the Catalyst Brands portfolio alongside other apparel retailers such as Brooks Brothers and Eddie Bauer.

Its departments include men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s apparel, cosmetics, jewelry, and home furnishings along with leased departments managed by Shearshare, US Vision and Lifetouch. The chain focuses on lifestyle products for middle class households.

==Overview==
JCPenney was founded in 1902 as a group of dry goods stores that James Cash Penney managed as part of the Golden Rule chain and incorporated under his own name in 1913. The stores were initially located in downtown areas but shifted to shopping malls during the 1960s.

The chain struggled in the early 21st century amid the rise of internet retail and the decline of mall traffic and stay-home measures during the COVID-19 pandemic forced it into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2020. It emerged from bankruptcy under the joint ownership of mall operators Simon Property Group and Brookfield Properties, later joined by Authentic Brands Group as a minority owner.

In January 2025 JCPenney was combined with SPARC Group — Simon and Authentic&#x27;s portfolio of legacy retail brands — to form Catalyst Brands.

== 20th century ==
=== Background and early history: 1902–1960 ===


James Cash Penney was born in Hamilton, Missouri. After graduating from high school, Penney worked for a local retailer. He relocated to Colorado at the advice of a doctor, hoping that a better climate would improve his health. In 1898, Penney went to work for Thomas Callahan and Guy Johnson, who owned dry goods stores called Golden Rule stores in Colorado and Wyoming. In 1899, Callahan sent Penney to Evanston, Wyoming, to work with Johnson in another Golden Rule store. Callahan and Johnson asked Penney to join them in opening a new Golden Rule store. Using money from savings and a loan, Penney joined the partnership and moved with his wife and infant son to Kemmerer, Wyoming, to start his own store. Penney opened the store on April 14, 1902. He participated in the creation of two more stores and purchased full interest in all three locations when Callahan and Johnson dissolved their partnership in 1907. In 1909, Penney moved his company headquarters to Salt Lake City, Utah, to be closer to banks and railroads. By 1912, Penney had 34 stores in the Rocky Mountain States.

In 1913, the company was incorporated under the new name, J. C. Penney Company, with William Henry McManus as a co-founder. In 1914, the headquarters was moved to New York City to simplify buying, financing, and transportation of goods. By 1917, the company operated 175 stores in 22 states in the United States. J. C. Penney acquired The Crescent Corset Company in 1920, the company&#x27;s first wholly owned subsidiary. In 1922, the company&#x27;s oldest active private brand, Big Mac work clothes, was launched. The company opened its 500th store in 1924 in Hamilton, Missouri, James Cash Penney&#x27;s hometown. By the opening of the 1,000th store in 1928, gross business had reached $190 million (equivalent to $ in 2025).

In 1940, Sam Walton began working at a J. C. Penney in Des Moines, Iowa. Walton subsequently founded retailer Walmart in 1962. By 1941, J. C. Penney operated 1,600 stores in all 48 states. In 1956, J. C. Penney started national advertising with a series of advertisements in &quot;Life&quot; magazine. J. C. Penney credit cards were first issued in 1959.

The company dedicated its first full-line shopping-center department store in 1961. This store was located at Black Horse Pike Center in Audubon, New Jersey. The second full-line shopping center store was dedicated, at King of Prussia Plaza in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania in late 1962. Those stores expanded the lines of merchandise and services that an average J. C. Penney carried to include appliances, sporting goods, tools, garden\lawn merchandise, restaurants, beauty salons, portrait studios, auto parts, and auto centers.

In 1962, J. C. Penney entered discount merchandising with the acquisition of General Merchandise Company which gave them The Treasury stores. These discount operations proved unsuccessful and were shuttered in 1981. In 1963, J. C. Penney issued its first catalog. The company operated in-store catalog desks in eight states. The catalogs were distributed by the Milwaukee Catalog distribution center.

In 1969, the company acquired Thrift Drug, a chain of drugstores headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It also acquired &quot;Supermarkets Interstate&quot;, an Omaha-based food retailer which operated leased departments in J. C. Penney stores, The Treasury stores, and Thrift Drug stores.

=== Expansion beyond the contiguous US ===
In the 1960s, JCPenney expanded to include Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Stores were opened in Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska in 1962, followed by Honolulu, Hawaii in 1966, and Puerto Rico in 1968. The Penney Building in Anchorage partially collapsed and was damaged beyond repair in the 1964 Alaska earthquake. The company rebuilt the store as a shorter building on a larger footprint and followed up by building Anchorage&#x27;s first public parking garage, which opened in 1968. The Honolulu store was located at Ala Moana Center, and closed in 2003, along with all remaining locations in the state, making Hawaii the only U.S. state to not currently have a JCPenney store. The Penney store at Plaza Las Américas mall in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which opened in 1968, featured three levels and . It was the largest JCPenney until a store was dedicated at Greater Chicago&#x27;s Woodfield Mall in 1971. The Woodfield Mall store served as the largest in the chain until a replacement store opened at Plaza Las Américas in 1998, which is in size.

=== Death of J.C. Penney and peak: 1970s ===
On February 12, 1971, James Cash Penney died at the age of 95; the company&#x27;s stores were closed the morning of his funeral on February 16. That year, the company adopted the &quot;JCPenney&quot; style in advertising. and its revenues reached $5 billion (equivalent to $ in 2025) for the first time and catalog business made a profit for the first time.

JCPenney reached its peak number of stores in 1973, with 2,053 stores, 300 of which were full-line establishments. However, the company was hard hit by the 1974 recession with its stock price declining by two-thirds.

In 1977, J. C. Penney sold its four stores in Italy to Italian department store chain La Rinascente; Penneys had opened in Italy in 1970 but left due to difficulties encountered when trying to expand in Italy and had only ever opened stores in the Lombardy region. In the same year they also closed down their unprofitable Supermarkets Interstate supermarket brand which operated in Treasury discount stores; however, the stores that were not in Treasury locations remained open.

In 1978, the J. C. Penney Historic District in Kemmerer, Wyoming, was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark. In 1979, JCPenney stores started accepting Visa cards. MasterCard was accepted the following year.

=== 1980s ===
In 1980, the company closed the unprofitable Treasury discount stores to focus resources on its core retail stores.

In 1983, JCPenney discontinued its appliance, hardware, outdoor equipment, and auto center departments, and sold its automotive centers to Firestone. Also in 1983, it began selling goods online through the Viewtron videotex service. That same year, fashion designer Roy Halston, signed a six-year, $1 billion deal with JCPenney to sell a line of affordable clothing, accessories, cosmetics, and perfumes ranging in price from $24 to $200. The move was considered controversial then as no other high-end designer up to that point in time had licensed their designs to a mid-price retailer. The line, named Halston III, would not last long, as it would be poorly received and discontinued after about a year. However, the business move paved the way for other such high-end designers to sell their products at stores of varying price ranges in the future.

In 1984, JCPenney acquired the First National Bank of Harrington, Delaware, and renamed it J. C. Penney National Bank. With the acquisition of the bank, the company became able to issue its own Mastercard and Visa Inc. cards. The company also began accepting American Express cards. Also that year, Thrift Drug began co-locating stores with Weis Markets, and acquired many former Pantry Pride properties. In April 1987, the company announced that it was moving its headquarters to Plano, Texas. After several years of development, the JCPenney Television Shopping Channel appeared on cable systems beginning in 1989. By the mid-1980s, all JCPenney stores had discontinued sales of firearms. Before this point, JCPenney carried rifles and shotguns branded as JCPenney but produced by numerous established firearms manufacturers. In the 1980s JCPenney&#x27;s also stopped selling outdoor equipment and hardware such as lawn mowers and tools.

=== Acquisitions and international expansion: 1990s ===
Construction on the new company headquarters in Plano, Texas, broke ground in 1990 and was completed in 1992. When Sears closed its catalog business in 1993, JCPenney became the largest catalog retailer in the United States. In 1995 the chain expanded to Chile with a store in the capital, Santiago. In 1995, the drug store business was expanded with the acquisition of Kerr Drug and again in 1996 with the purchase of Fay&#x27;s Drug. Then in November 1996 they acquired the Eckerd chain. Fay&#x27;s, Kerr, and Eckerd merged into J. C. Penney&#x27;s drug store subsidiary Thrift Drug. Fay&#x27;s, most Kerr, and Thrift drug stores were re-branded Eckerd in 1997. (Kerr Drug stores in The Carolinas remained branded as such because they were part of a group of stores that were divested because of trade competition issues raised during the merger.)

On December 9, 1998, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported JCPenney would acquire controlling interest of Lojas Renner for a little over $33 million, which increased the company&#x27;s maneuvering ability with their already existing units in Chile, Mexico and Puerto Rico. In 1998, JCPenney launched its online store.

Between 1995 and 1998, JCPenney entered Indonesia under partnership with Lippo Group (under their Multipolar investment arm) with the branding &quot;JCPenney&quot; &quot;Collections&quot;, also used by multiple international JCPenney branches across Asia during the decade. This type of JCPenney store only featured fashion for men, women and kids. During its tenure, JCPenney opened two flagship stores: in 1995 on the upper ground level of Lippo Supermal (now Supermal Karawaci), and in 1996 on the upper ground and first level of Mal Taman Anggrek. Aside from the two, JCPenney also opened smaller stores under the JCPenney Collections name in a few malls such as Plaza Blok M. All stores of JCPenney Collections in Indonesia started planning to close down due to 1997 Asian financial crisis – with the JCPenney Collections store in Taman Anggrek closed in December 1997, and the May 1998 riots – with the Lippo Supermal store looted by mass and exiting the mall that same month (having to close down for a period of time due to damage caused by arson in other sections of the mall). Currently, the previous stores are occupied by H&amp;M at Supermal Karawaci and Matahari Department Store at Mal Taman Anggrek respectively.

JCPenney left Chile in 1999, after five years in the country it closed down its home store and sold its main store in Santiago to Almacenes Paris. The stores were closed due to low profitability and high expenses.

== 21st century ==
===2000s ===
In early 2001, JCPenney closed 44 under-performing stores. In 2001, JCPenney sold its direct-marketing insurance unit to Dutch insurer Aegon for $1.3 billion (equivalent to $ in 2025) in cash to help refocus the company on retail. In 2003, the company opened three stores in strip centers in Texas, Minnesota, and Indiana. The new single-level, store format focuses on convenience, with wider aisles and centralized checkouts. In 2004, the company added 14 more stores and exited the drug store division after 35 years, with the sale of its Eckerd division. The company also sold its six Mexico stores to Grupo Carso, which rebranded five of the stores as Dorian&#x27;s and the other one as Sears Mexico. In 2005, JCPenney&#x27;s e-commerce storefront exceeded the $1 billion revenue mark for the first time. At the same time in June, the company would sell off its shares of Lojas Renner, the Brazilian-based retailer, generating $260 million from the sale as it discontinued its operations with Renner and its Latin American footholds as well.

In 2007, JCPenney launched the Ambrielle lingerie label, which became its largest private brand launched in the company&#x27;s history. JCPenney also re-introduced cosmetics with the opening of Sephora &quot;stores-within-a-store&quot; inside some JCPenney locations. Beginning in 2007, JCPenney&#x27;s store slogan changed from &quot;It&#x27;s All Inside&quot; to &quot;Every Day Matters.&quot; The new slogan and associated ad campaign was launched in television commercials during the 79th Academy Awards in late February 2007. After JCPenney sold off Eckerd in 2004, the locations that continued to operate as Eckerd (some locations in the Southern U.S. were sold to CVS Corporation) still had JCPenney Catalog Centers inside the stores (which was a carryover from locations that were once Thrift Drug) and continued to accept JCPenney credit cards. After Rite Aid finalized its acquisition of Eckerd in 2007, the Catalog Centers inside the soon-to-be-converted stores permanently closed. Although as a result of the acquisition, Rite Aid now accepts JCPenney credit cards, even at Rite Aid locations that existed before the acquisition of Eckerd. In November 2007, the company launched a new public website, JCPenneyBrands.com, which covers the company&#x27;s private and exclusive brands and its branding strategy, as well as a preview of an upcoming product line.

In February 2008, the company launched the American Living brand, as developed by Ralph Lauren, across several product lines. The launch, which was accompanied by an ad campaign during the 80th Academy Awards, was the company&#x27;s largest private brand launch. That summer, JCPenney also added a new brand to its home collection, Linden Street. The Linden Street brand features furniture, domestics, and home decor. Linden Street is sold exclusively in JCPenney stores and through its website. Other brands for juniors and young men were launched that summer. They included a relaunch of Le Tigre, along with Decree, and Fabulosity, a junior line of clothing by Kimora Lee Simmons.

In July 2009, new additions were made to the JCPenney young men&#x27;s department, including an expansion of its private brand Decree (previously exclusively a juniors clothing line) and the introduction of more skate/surf-oriented clothing, including Rusty, RS by Ryan Sheckler and 3rd Rail. In August, Albert Gonzalez&#x27;s defense lawyer announced JCPenney was a victim of a computer hacker, although the company stated that no customers&#x27; credit card information had been stolen. That year, JCPenney reached an agreement with Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee to feature full-service cafes within leased departments inside JCPenney stores across the country. Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee is still expanding café locations within JCPenney locations across the country.

===2010–2014===

In 2010, Vornado Realty Trust acquired a 9.9% stake in JCPenney but sold it in 2013 for $13.00 per share. On January 24, 2011, JCPenney shut down its catalog business and 19 outlet stores. Seven additional stores and two call centers also closed.

On February 12, 2011, &quot;The New York Times&quot; revealed that JCPenney was using &quot;spamdexing&quot; techniques to manipulate Google search rankings. Google reduced the company&#x27;s visibility, and JCPenney fired its search engine consultant.

In June 2011, Ron Johnson, former head of Apple&#x27;s retail division, became JCPenney&#x27;s CEO. That same year, the company sold its 15 remaining catalog outlets to SB Capital Group, converting them into JC&#x27;s 5 Star Outlets.

In December 2011, JCPenney purchased a 16.6% stake in Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, intending to create &quot;mini-Martha Stewart shops&quot; in its stores by 2013.

In early 2012, JCPenney implemented a new pricing strategy, replacing sales with &quot;Every Day&quot; prices, but saw a 22% sales decline by mid-year. The company also experienced staff cuts, laying off 1,600 employees in January and 600 more in April 2012. Johnson was dismissed in April 2013 and replaced by former CEO Mike Ullman.

In late 2013, JCPenney faced challenges in the stock market, issuing 84 million shares amid declining margins and a return to promotional pricing strategies.

===2015–2019===
In January 2015, it was announced that JCPenney would close 39 under-performing stores nationwide and lay off 2,250 employees. That same year, the company announced that it was liquidating its The Foundry Big &amp; Tall Supply Co. chain of standalone clothing stores. In January 2016, JCPenney announced plans to relaunch its business of selling major appliances to target a wave of millennials who are buying first-time homes. In February, JCPenney opened a support center in Bangalore, India.

In January 2017, JCPenney sold its headquarters campus and surrounding land in Plano, Texas, to Dreien Opportunity Partners as a leaseback sale to maintain operations at the location. The land has since been broken up and sold and developed. Space inside the headquarters building has been subleased. Part of this land was sold to where the current Toyota North America headquarters is now located. In February, JCPenney announced that it would shutter two distribution centers and up to 140 under-performing stores as it wrestled with disappointing sales. The company also planned to offer buyouts to roughly 6,000 employees. On March 17, JCPenney released a list of 138 locations that would close by the end of June. By closing stores and distribution facilities, JCPenney would redirect resources to help expand its store-in-store Sephora boutiques, and add Nike and Adidas boutiques, similar to what Macy&#x27;s has done with Finish Line, Lids and LensCrafters.

In an effort to capitalize on self-deprecating humor and improve its reputation, JCPenney collaborated with Nicole Richie and other designers to open a &quot;Jacques Penne&quot; pop-up shop in Manhattan during the 2017 holiday season.

In 2018, the JCPenney at Plaza Palma Real in Humacao, Puerto Rico closed permanently, after Hurricane Maria devastated the store in September 2017. In May, JCPenney reported an adjusted loss of $69 million in the first quarter, even worse than Wall Street predicted, and lowered its projections for the year. Sales fell 4%, also missing estimates. Earlier in 2018, the company announced it would cut 360 jobs at its stores and corporate headquarters. The company lowered its earnings forecast for the year to 13 cents per share at best, and said it could lose as much as 7 cents. JCPenney finished the quarter with just $181 million in cash, down from $363 million a year ago. Much of the big decrease was because of a $190 billion debt replace. On May 22, JCPenney announced the resignation of their CEO, Marvin Ellison. On October 2, JCPenney announced former Jo-Ann Stores CEO Jill Soltau as their CEO, effective October 15. With the announcement, JCPenney&#x27;s shares rose 9%. The company ranked 235 on the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue. She has also brought new talent and has cleaned out inventory. On December 26, the stock price of JCPenney (NYSE: JCP) fell below $1 per share. This was the first time ever that shares had fallen below $1 in the 110-year history of the company, which started trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1929. The stock fell 68% over the course of 2018, including a 30% drop in December 2018 alone.

On February 6, 2019, JCPenney said it would stop selling major appliances on February 28, and that furniture would be limited to online and stores in Puerto Rico. On February 28, JCPenney announced its intent to close 27 stores in 2019, including 18 full-line department stores and nine home-and-furniture stores. The closure announcement was paired with news that the retailer had suffered a 4% decline in same-store sales during the 2018 holiday quarter. On March 26, JCPenney announced the hiring of Bill Wofford as chief financial officer. Wofford came to the company from The Vitamin Shoppe, where he had served as CFO since June 2018. On May 21, JCPenney announced that Shawn Gensch would be the chief customer officer, to take effect on June 3. Gensch comes from Sprouts Farmers Market where he was their CCO. Also on May 21, JCPenney announced a net sales decline of 5.6% and a net loss of $154 million for its fiscal first quarter of 2019, which ended on May 5.

===COVID and bankruptcy: 2020===
On January 19, 2020, JCPenney announced plans to close six stores.

====COVID-19 pandemic====
On March 15, 2020, when businesses were ordered to temporarily close in many states, the chain closed all of its stores and furloughed its employees. JCPenney became the fourth major national retailer to file for bankruptcy in May 2020. Days earlier, it was reported in a regulatory filing that JCPenney would give bonuses totaling nearly $10 million to the company&#x27;s senior managers, which included $4.5 million to CEO Jill Soltau. After 91 years, it was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange on May 18, 2020, and started trading over-the-counter the following business day.

On March 18, JCPenney announced all retail stores would temporarily close in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic until April 2. On March 31, JCPenney announced an extension of the planned April 2 reopening, with a new date not possible to be determined at the time. On May 1, JCPenney announced a limited number of stores would reopen.

====Bankruptcy and new ownership====
On May 15, 2020, JCPenney filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and announced that there would be an additional 242 store closings, blaming the COVID-19 pandemic for its action. By June 17, JCPenney reopened approximately 827 stores; most of the 154 scheduled for permanent closure in 2020 were among those reopened, with final closing sales in progress. On June 22, JCPenney identified an additional 13 stores that would be permanently closed. On July 7, 2020, JCPenney announced that they would close two stores in New York City; one at the Manhattan Mall, which was closed immediately and the Kings Plaza store in Brooklyn, which closed on Sunday, September 27, 2020. On December 17, 2020, JCPenney announced that they would close 15 additional stores in March 2021. As of June 2021, there have been a total of 175 store closures. On December 30, 2020, it was announced that Jill Soltau would step down as CEO of JCPenney, effective December 31, 2020. It is unclear whether she was fired or resigned. On January 1, 2021, Soltau was replaced by Simon Property&#x27;s chief investment officer, Stanley Shashoua.

On June 4, 2020, JCPenney released a list of 148 stores slated to close starting in late June 2020, with eleven additional store closures announced on June 22 and two additional stores on July 7, with the previously announced store closing locations remaining on hold pending further review, for a planned closing a total of 242 stores. Since the initial filing, rumors of potential buyers included Amazon, Sycamore Partners, and a group consisting of Authentic Brands (Forever 21, Aeropostale, Barneys), and mall owners Simon Property Group and Brookfield Properties. On July 8, JCPenney submitted their bankruptcy exit plan to existing lenders, and requested more time for negotiations. On July 31, 2020, it was announced that 21 stores, including the &quot;Mother Store&quot; in Kemmerer, Wyoming, would be auctioned off as part of the proceedings.On September 9, 2020, Brookfield Property Partners and Simon Property Group agreed to purchase JCPenney for about $800 million, including $300 million in cash and assuming $500 million of debt, which was later approved by the court on November 10, 2020. It had been established that once the company emerges from bankruptcy it is poised to save nearly 60,000 jobs, according to various independent studies. The company was paying $2.45 million in monthly rent at the time it sold its headquarters offices in Plano, Texas in 2017; the location was permanently vacated in November 2020.

=== Under Simon and Brookfield: 2020–present ===
In October 2021, the company opened 10 new shop-in-shop locations across the US, featuring a wide variety of brands, including indie and BIPOC brands, among them flagship partner Thirteen Lune. Marc Rosen became CEO in 2021.

In April 2022, JCPenney&#x27;s owners—Simon and Brookfield—offered $8.6 billion to purchase Kohl&#x27;s. Sephora had already announced plans to contract exclusively with Kohl&#x27;s by 2023, and had piloted Sephora Inside Kohls at select store locations. With this deal, Sephora would remain affiliated with, and under control of, the Simon and Brookfield retail portfolio, therefore superseding and annulling previous agreements for Sephora to leave JCPenney in favor of Kohl&#x27;s.

The company returned to its Plano, Texas, headquarters in July 2023. The reopened headquarters contains over 2,000 workers and occupies three floors.

<text>Shark Bay () is a World Heritage Site in the Gascoyne region of Western Australia. The area is located approximately north of Perth, on the westernmost point of the Australian continent.

UNESCO&#x27;s listing of Shark Bay as a World Heritage Site reads:

The bay features Australia&#x27;s most abundant marine ecosystems. It is a popular fishing spot.

==History==
The record of Australian Aboriginal occupation of Shark Bay extends to years BP. At that time most of the area was dry land, and rising sea levels flooded Shark Bay between BP and BP. A considerable number of Aboriginal midden sites have been found, especially on Peron Peninsula and Dirk Hartog Island which provide evidence of some of the foods gathered from the waters and nearby land areas.

An expedition led by Dirk Hartog happened upon the area in 1616, becoming the second group of Europeans known to have visited Australia, after the crew of &quot;Duyfken&quot; under Willem Janszoon had visited Cape York in 1606. The area was given the name Shark Bay by the English explorer William Dampier, on 7 August 1699. Shark Bay was also visited by Louis Aleno de St Aloüarn in 1772, Nicolas Baudin from 1801 to 1803 and Louis de Freycinet in 1818. Europeans, mostly pastoralists, settled in Shark Bay during the 1860s to 1870s. Pearling developed rapidly from 1870.

Commercial whaling was conducted in the bay in the first half of the 20th century by Norwegian-owned factory ships and their catcher vessels. In the late 1930s, up to 1,000 humpback whales were taken per season.

The heritage-listed area had a population of fewer than people as at the 2011 census and a coastline of over . The half-dozen small communities making up this population occupy less than 1% of the total area.

== Climate ==
The Shark Bay Heritage Area has a hot desert climate under the Köppen Climate Classification, with hot, dry summers, and very mild, relatively wet winters.
== Shark Bay World Heritage Site ==
The World Heritage status of the region was created and negotiated in 1991, the first such site in Western Australia. The site was gazetted on the Australian National Heritage List on 21 May 2007 under the .

=== Protected areas ===
Declared as a World Heritage Site in 1991, the site covers an area of , of which about 70 per cent are marine waters. It includes many protected areas and conservation reserves, including Shark Bay Marine Park, Francois Peron National Park, Hamelin Pool Marine Nature Reserve, Zuytdorp Nature Reserve and numerous protected islands. Denham and Useless Loop both fall within the boundary of the site, yet are specifically excluded from it.

=== Landforms ===
The bay itself covers an area of , with an average depth of . It is divided by shallow banks and has many peninsulas and islands. The coastline is over long. There are about of limestone cliffs overlooking the bay. One spectacular segment of cliffs is known as the Zuytdorp Cliffs. The bay is located in the transition zone between three major climatic regions and between two major botanical provinces.

Peron Peninsula divides the bay and is the home of its largest settlements as well as a National Park at the northern end.

Dirk Hartog Island is of historical significance due to landings upon it by early explorers. In 1616, Dirk Hartog landed at Inscription Point on the north end of the island and marked his discovery with a pewter plate, inscribed with the date and nailed to a post. This plate was then replaced by Willem de Vlamingh and returned to the Netherlands. It is now kept in the Rijksmuseum. The Shark Bay Discovery Centre in Denham has a replica of this plate.

Bernier and Dorre islands in the north-west corner of the heritage area are among the last-remaining habitats of two varieties of Australian mammals, hare-wallabies, threatened with extinction. They are used, with numerous other smaller islands throughout the marine park, to release threatened species that are being bred at Project Eden in François Peron National Park. These islands are free of feral non-native animals which might predate upon the threatened species, and so provide a safe haven in which to restore species that are threatened on the mainland.

In 1999 the Australian Wildlife Conservancy acquired the pastoral lease over Faure Island, off Monkey Mia. Sea turtles nest there seasonally and are the subject of studies conducted in conjunction with the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.

=== Fauna ===
Shark Bay is an area of major zoological importance. It is home to about 10,000 dugongs (&#x27;sea cows&#x27;), around 12.5% of the world&#x27;s population, and there are many Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, particularly at Monkey Mia. The dolphins here have been particularly friendly since the 1960s. The area supports 26 threatened Australian mammal species, over 230 species of bird, and nearly 150 species of reptile. It is an important breeding and nursery ground for fish, crustaceans, and coelenterates. There are over 323 fish species, many of them sharks and rays.

Some bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay exhibit one of the few known cases of tool use in marine mammals (along with sea otters): they protect their nose with a sponge while foraging for food in the sandy sea bottom. Humpback and southern right whales use the waters of the bay as migratory staging post while other species such as Bryde&#x27;s whale come into the bay less frequently but to feed or rest. The threatened green and loggerhead sea turtles nest on the bay&#x27;s sandy beaches. The largest fish in the world, the whale shark, gathers in the bay during the April and May full moons.

=== Flora ===
Shark Bay has the largest known area of seagrass, with seagrass meadows covering over of the bay. It includes the Wooramel Seagrass Bank, the largest seagrass bank in the world and contains a &quot;Posidonia australis&quot; meadow formed by a single plant, the largest in the world.

Shark Bay also contains the largest number of seagrass species ever recorded in one place; twelve species have been found, with up to nine occurring together in some places. The seagrasses are a vital part of the complex environment of the bay. Over thousands of years, sediment and shell fragments have accumulated in the seagrasses to form vast expanses of seagrass beds. This has raised the sea floor, making the bay shallower. Seagrasses are the basis of the food chain in Shark Bay, providing home and shelter to various marine species and attracting the dugong population.

In Shark Bay&#x27;s hot, dry climate, evaporation greatly exceeds the annual precipitation rate. Thus, the seawater in the shallow bays becomes very salt-concentrated, or &#x27;hypersaline&#x27;. Seagrasses also restrict the tidal flow of waters through the bay area, preventing the ocean tides from diluting the sea water. The water of the bay is 1.5 to 2 times more salty than the surrounding ocean waters.
=== Stromatolites ===
Based on growth rate it is believed that about 1,000 years ago cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) began building up stromatolites in Hamelin Pool at the Hamelin Station Reserve in the southern part of the bay. These microbialites, a type of sedimentary structure, are modern examples of some of the earliest signs of life on Earth, with fossilized stromatolites being found dating from 3.5billion years ago at North Pole near Marble Bar, in Western Australia, and are considered the type of fossil with the longest continuous presence in the geological record. Shark Bay&#x27;s modern examples were first identified in 1956 at Hamelin Pool, before that only being known in the fossil record. They may, however, be significantly different from fossilised examples, as growth rates may be up to 250 times slower than the estimated growth rates of some Precambrian stromatolites. There is debate, however, over whether this indicates a true difference in growth rate, or if Precambrian growth estimates are instead too high. Hamelin Pool contains the most diverse and abundant examples of living stromatolite forms in the world. Other occurrences are found at Lake Clifton near Mandurah and Lake Thetis near Cervantes. It is hypothesized that some stromatolites contain a new form of chlorophyll, chlorophyll f.

=== Shark Bay World Heritage Discovery Centre ===
Facilities around the World Heritage area, provided by the Shire of Shark Bay and the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, include the Shark Bay World Heritage Discovery Centre in Denham which provides interactive displays and comprehensive information about the features of the region.

<doc id="421251" wikidata="Q1575946" url="?curid=421251" title="Wealden District">
<text>Wealden is a local government district in East Sussex, England. Its council is based in Hailsham, the district&#x27;s second largest town. The district also includes the towns of Crowborough, Polegate and Uckfield, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. The district&#x27;s name comes from the Weald, the landscape and ancient woodland which occupies much of the centre and north of the area.

Much of the district&#x27;s landscape is recognised for its beauty; the south of the district includes part of the South Downs National Park, and the north of the district includes part of the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The district has two sections of coastline, lying east and west of the neighbouring authority of Eastbourne, with the western section of coastline including the cliffs known as the Seven Sisters.

The neighbouring districts are Eastbourne, Lewes, Mid Sussex, Tandridge, Sevenoaks, Tunbridge Wells and Rother.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. It covered the area of two former districts, which were both abolished at the same time:
*Hailsham Rural District
*Uckfield Rural District
The new district was named Wealden after the landscape and woodland.

==Governance==
Wealden District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by East Sussex County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

In the parts of the district within the South Downs National Park, town planning is the responsibility of the South Downs National Park Authority. The district council appoints one of its councillors to serve on the 27-person National Park Authority.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being led by a coalition of the Liberal Democrats and Greens.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1999 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and subsequent changes of allegiance up to June 2024, the composition of the council was:
The Liberal Democrats and Greens sit together as the &quot;Alliance for Wealden&quot; group, which forms the council&#x27;s administration. Of the independent councillors, five sit as the &quot;Independent Group&quot;, four form the &quot;Independent Democrats&quot; and two do not belong to a group. Since November 2024, the 2 Labour councillors joined the &quot;Alliance for Wealden&quot; group, with one joining the cabinet. The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Council Offices on Vicarage Lane in Hailsham. The building was purpose-built for the council and opened in 1982.

When created in 1974 the council inherited two main offices from its predecessors:
*Cortlandt, 18 George Street, Hailsham, an eighteenth century house which had been bought by Hailsham Rural District Council in 1932.
*Starfield, Beacon Road, Crowborough, formerly the home and observatory of astronomer Isaac Roberts, which had been bought by Uckfield Rural District Council in 1928.
The council&#x27;s staff were initially divided between the two buildings. The council moved its Hailsham office from Cortlandt to the new Council Offices on Vicarage Lane in 1982. The Crowborough office moved to a new building on Pine Grove in 1988, with Starfield subsequently being redeveloped for housing.

The council subsequently consolidated its offices at the Hailsham building and sold the Crowborough building to Crowborough Town Council in 2016.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 45 councillors representing 41 wards, with each ward electing one or two councillors. Elections are held every four years.

==Geography==
Wealden District covers two main upland areas: the section of the High Weald within East Sussex; and the eastern end of the South Downs, between which lies the Vale of Sussex, the lowlands of which are named the Pevensey Levels. The River Ouse, some of the tributaries of which originate in the district, is the border with the Lewes District; and the River Cuckmere is wholly in Wealden. The district&#x27;s coastline to the English Channel to the south is interrupted by Eastbourne. The River Rother rises on the Weald and flows easterly to the east of Rye Bay.

The Wealden basin contains significant reserves of shale oil, totalling 4.4 billion barrels of oil in Wealden and surrounding areas according to a 2014 study, which then Business and Energy Minister Michael Fallon said &quot;will bring jobs and business opportunities&quot; and significantly help with UK energy self-sufficiency. Fracking in the area is required to achieve these objectives, which has been opposed by environmental groups.

At the 2011 census the district had the highest proportion of home ownership of the 37 local authorities in Surrey, Sussex and Kent.

===Towns and parishes===
This district is entirely divided into civil parishes. The parish councils for Crowborough, Hailsham, Polegate and Uckfield take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council.
==Transport==
The major trunk road is the A22, London to Eastbourne; it is crossed by the A26 Maidstone–Lewes road at Uckfield; and the A267 Tunbridge Wells to Eastbourne road. There are also three west–east roads: the A259 coastal route; next inland is the A27 Pevensey–Brighton trunk road; and further to the north the A272 cross-country route to Winchester.

The East Coastway Line, serving Eastbourne and Hastings, uses the Vale of Sussex and has two station serving different sides of Pevensey in the district, which forms a generally suburban conurbation with Westham and a largely rural holiday and visitor coastline, Pevensey Bay. The other railway line is the Uckfield Branch Line from London Bridge.

Wealden is crossed by a number of National Cycle Network routes:

Route 2 (South Coast Cycle Route) 

Route 21 (London to Eastbourne) which makes use of the Forest Way and Cuckoo Trail paths along disused railway lines

Long-distance footpaths include the:

South Downs Way

Monarch&#x27;s Way

Sussex Border Path

Wealdway.

==Media==
Wealden is served by BBC South East and ITV Meridian broadcasting from the Heathfield TV transmitter which is situated near Heathfield. 

Radio stations for the area are:
*BBC Radio Sussex
*Heart South 
*Ashdown Radio (serving Uckfield and Crowborough)
*Seahaven FM (covering Polegate)
*More Radio Eastbourne (covering Hailsham)

==Landmarks==
Major landmarks include the Seven Sisters and Cuckmere Haven along the coast; and the Long Man of Wilmington together with all of the paths over the South Downs National Park. Roman fortified hills can be found in the north of the area and Uckfield has a large architectural conservation area.

Sheffield Park Garden is an informal landscape garden now owned by the National Trust but laid out by Capability Brown. Near to this is the terminus of the Bluebell Railway, a heritage, steam railway line.

A late medieval castle construction, moated Herstmonceux Castle, was begun in 1440. It is open to visitors and there are organised tours on a few summer days.

The north of the district includes Ashdown Forest, which provided the inspiration for the Hundred Acre Wood in the Winnie the Pooh stories by A. A. Milne, who lived in Hartfield.

<doc id="421253" wikidata="Q639395" url="?curid=421253" title="Union of Citizens of Georgia">
<text>Union of Citizens of Georgia (UCG; ), also known as the Citizens&#x27; Union of Georgia or Georgian Citizens&#x27; Union, was the ruling party of Georgia from 1993 to 2003. It was established by the president Eduard Shevardnadze, who had previously served as the Communist leader of the Georgian SSR from 1972 to 1985, and David Chantladze, former General Trade Representative of the Soviet Union to Czechoslovakia. 

Shevardnadze led the party to victory in the 1995 and 1999 parliamentary elections, however the party disbanded soon after his removal from power in the aftermath of the Rose Revolution, which occurred following the 2003 parliamentary election which was widely seen as being rigged. 

During UCG’s rule, the country suffered from severe corruption and political instability. The government is generally described as being &quot;semi-authoritarian&quot; tolerating pluralism and political competition as long as it did not substantially challenge the party’s grip on power. UCG is described as having distinct conservative and liberal factions, the latter of which advocated for reforms. In foreign policy UCG supported Georgia&#x27;s membership in the European Union and NATO.

==History==
===Political context===

Eduard Shevardnadze’s entry into independent Georgia’s politics starts with the removal of the president Zviad Gamsakhurdia through a military coup and the subsequent 1992 general election, which Shevardnadze won overwhelmingly as an independent candidate. The elections, which have been described as fairly democratic, saw the emergence of a fragmented multi-party parliament, however, it has also been criticized for bringing in a parliament that lacked real opposition. Despite this, the post-election situation in the country has been described as &quot;verging on anarchy&quot; with Georgia being labeled a failed state.

===Government===

In November 1993, in the last days of the Georgian Civil War, Shevardnadze founded Union of Citizens of Georgia (UCG), which gained a majority in the parliament in a coalition with a group of independent MPs. Soon a team of &quot;young reformers&quot; headed by Zurab Zhvania started to gain influence within the party. In 1995, Zhvania was elected the speaker of the parliament with his wing additionally starting to dominate the apparatus of the party. Zhvania was viewed by some observers as the natural heir to Shevardnadze.

Soon Zhvania’s team was joined by an up-and-coming Western-educated young lawyer Mikheil Saakashvili. He was elected to the parliament in 1995 with him being soon appointed chairman of a key Parliamentary committee responsible for setting out reforms. Nino Burjanadze was another figure who joined the reformist group, being another young lawyer who was educated at an elite Russian university.

The team of &quot;young reformers&quot; implemented many significant reforms modeled after Western legislation, including a new civil code, civil proceedings code, criminal proceedings code, tax code, and general administrative code. The group also pushed for merit-based reforms in the judiciary with Soviet-era judges being widely replaced by ones appointed through a meritocratic system. Another important step in the country’s democratization was the tolerance of independent and critical media and the establishment of a non-governmental sector (NGOs). The reforms have been described as bringing &quot;Georgia closer to European standards&quot;, nevertheless, the country’s democratic nature was still subject to frequent criticism. In 1999, Georgia was the first country from the South Caucasus to be admitted to the Council of Europe. This move was seen as a victory not only for Shevardnadze but also for the group of &quot;reformers&quot;.

During UCG&#x27;s rule Adjara was ruled by Aslan Abashidze’s Democratic Union for Revival party with him being accused of creating a &quot;personal dictatorship&quot;. While the relations in the mid-90s were good between Abashidze and the central Georgian authorities, by the late 90s they worsened with Abashidze leading the largest opposition bloc in the 1999 parliamentary election. 

Another crisis took shape in 1999 with the government effectively losing control of Pankisi region as a result of a spillover of the war in Chechnya. The Chechen refugees fleeing the war took shelter in the region with some being anti-Russian insurgents. Russian authorities subsequently accused the Georgian state of harboring terrorists. The area quickly descended into a state of lawlessness, with drug and arms trafficking as well as kidnappings for ransom being a frequent occurrence. This in 2002 led the United States to launch Georgia Train and Equip program with the goal of training the Georgian Military by US Special Forces soldiers.

===Rose Revolution===
A rift was also growing between &quot;the reformers&quot; and the establishment factions in UCG. The division was intensified following the 2000 presidential election. In 2000, several MPs defected from the party establishing New Rights Party. The then justice minister Saakashvili also left UCG and established the opposition National Movement party. Zhvania and Burjanadze subsequently split in 2002 and created the United Democrats party.

By the late 90s, the government’s popularity drastically decreased being attributed to its inability to exert territorial control over the country, weak economic growth, and lack of development of public infrastructure. The 2002 local elections marked a turning point for UCG where it achieved a crushing defeat getting less than 2% in Tbilisi City Assembly. National Movement led by Saakashvili got a quarter of the votes in the election with him becoming the chairman of the assembly.

Despite the elections held under UCG&#x27;s rule being generally viewed as fraudulent, the scale of the fraud was described as not being enough to change the outcome of an election. This changed in 2003 parliamentary election which was widely viewed as rigged. Parallel voting tabulations had shown an overwhelming opposition victory despite the official results claiming otherwise. The pro-government parties were united in the &quot;For a New Georgia&quot; bloc, which cooperated with Democratic Union for Revival.

National Movement and Burjanadze-Democrats organized mass rallies in protest of the official results demanding the government either recognize the opposition&#x27;s victory or resign. Some other significant opposition forces such as Labour Party and New Rights Party chose to abstain from the protests. The opposition and the government faced off on the first session the new parliament forcing MPs and Shevardnadze, who was delivering a speech, to leave the room. The following day, Shevardnadze made the decision to resign as president making Burjanadze, the speaker of the parliament, the new interim president. Days later, the Georgian Supreme Court declared the results invalid. On 23 November 2003, UCG was dissolved. This event was later known as the Rose Revolution.

===Post-revolution===
Saakashvili emerged as the clear leader from the protests, with him winning an overwhelming victory in the snap 2004 presidential election, where he ran virtually uncontested. National Movement and United Democrats later merged with them forming United National Movement. The party went on to win 66.24% in the 2004 parliamentary election.

==Ideology==
Union of Citizens of Georgia was a big tent or a catch-all party. The party has been described as being created by Eduard Shevardnadze to sideline the military leaders who brought him to power through the 1991–1992 Georgian coup d&#x27;état. Its name expressed a desire to unify all citizens around President Shevardnadze irrespective of any differences, and it united various factions representing different generations and political beliefs. The analysts described the UCG as never being based on any ideology, rather serving as an eclectic structure united through loyality to President Shevardnadze. Despite the party positioning itself as social democratic and joining the Socialist International, the analysts noted the difference between the platform of the party and its actions as its economic policy was following the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund and the monetarist direction. The government has been described as having distinct conservative and liberal factions, latter of which advocated for reforms. In foreign policy UCG supported European integration and Atlanticism.

The party&#x27;s rule has been labeled as competitive authoritarianism and semi-authoritarian. The government has been described to have created a hybrid regime with weak state institutions and consistent voter fraud. State capture has also been attributed to the party. Despite the undemocratic nature of the government it has been attributed to bringing a &quot;spirit of pluralism into [the] Georgian society&quot;. With Shevardnadze being unable to concentrate political control, the power under his rule has been described as being diffused among various &quot;informal
centres of power&quot; such as the leadership of the parliament and the group of &quot;reformers&quot;, the Ministry of the Internal Affairs, Abashidze and the Government of Adjara, the &quot;Taxpayer Union&quot; of the &quot;selected businessmen&quot;, the local governors and etc. All these centers competed for power with each other while being under the patronage of Shevardnadze who mediated their disputes and presided over the situation.

Analysts have noted that &quot;certain space for civic and political freedoms [existed] but few conditions for genuine political competition and participation&quot; were in place. The UCG government has been described as being dominated by a &quot;clientelistic networks or clans&quot; that served the ruling elite. Georgia&#x27;s perception during their rule was also as one of the most corrupt countries in the world.

===Foreign policy===
The foreign policy of the UCG and Eduard Shevardnadze has been subject to debate among the analysts. Shevardnadze was accused of pro-Russian policies such as joining the Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States in 1993, signing the Georgian-Russian friendship treaty in 1994, legitimizing the Russian military bases in Georgia in 1995 and supporting Russia during the First Chechen War. However, the Shevardnadze administration and other analysts rejected these characterizations, considering the government&#x27;s approach towards Russia to be based on &quot;pragmatic realism&quot;.

Shevardnadze&#x27;s rhetoric towards Russia differentiated between &quot;two Russias&quot;: &quot;good&quot; (democratic, pro-Western) and &quot;bad&quot; (reactionary, red-brown, communist, imperial). He argued that his government sought to befriend the &quot;good Russia&quot;, which was represented by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. According to some analysts, with this approach the Shevardnadze government tried to &quot;win benevolence of the acting Russian government&quot; and &quot;send a message of loyality to the West&quot;. Therefore, Shevardnadze presented the policy of appeasement of Russia not as an alternative to Western models of state-building and economic reforms, which his government claimed to follow, but as being in line with the Western policies towards Boris Yeltsin, arguing that the close ties with Russia were relatively acceptable for Georgia as long as Russia followed democratic and pro-Western path. However, some analysts differentiate between this &quot;pragmatic&quot; and &quot;sincere&quot; pro-Russian approaches, arguing that the &quot;sincere&quot; pro-Russian sentiments were also present in Shevardnadze&#x27;s rhetoric, with Shevardnadze justifying joining the CIS in 1993 to receive Russian support during the Georgian Civil War by alluding to Heraclius II of Georgia signing a treaty on protectorate with Russia in 1783. Joining CIS was presented by the pro-CIS politicians as a destined embrace of Russia to avert the otherwise inevitable destruction of the country and restore the security and stability, as well as overcome economic crisis. However, this approach still was based not on Slavophile, Eurasianist or Russian exceptionalist sentiments but on a longing for Soviet-era stability, and also it was not anti-Western as the government simultaneously sought closer ties with the West, and chose to follow the IMF and the World Bank guidance instead of entering the . The &quot;sincere pro-Russian sentiment&quot; failed to develop into the coherent doctrine and Shevardnadze was attacked by pro-Russian and anti-Western neo-communist opposition parties, such that led by former Security Chief Igor Giorgadze. Some analysts have described Shevardnadze&#x27;s policy as being based on &quot;pragmaticism&quot; reflecting a Georgia&#x27;s position as a small state in relation to the larger neighbor and acknowledgement that Russia would play a role in Georgia&#x27;s future.

The documents on basic principles of foreign policy, the military doctrine and national security concept passed by the parliament and the ministry of defence in 1997 emphasized Georgia&#x27;s allegiance to the Western model of liberal democracy and conformity of Georgian laws to international norms. At the same time, the documents on basic principles and the national security concept acknowledged the special role of the Georgian Orthodox Church and the need to &quot;stimulate Orthodox traditions&quot;. While acknowledging the freedom of worship and the separation of church and state, they also noted that &quot;this does not includes separation of church from society&quot;, which has been described as &quot;contradicting the typical Western model&quot;. However, the documents have been characterized as &quot;reflecting Western legal values and advocating integration into the Western economic and security system&quot;. The Military Doctrine was the most cautious, declaring the priority of &quot;establishing peaceful relations with neighboring countries&quot;, primarily referring to Russia and Turkey. The document on basic principles was the harshest towards Russia, accusing it of seeing CIS as the first step towards reconstitution of the USSR, condemning it for interfering in the separatist conflicts to undermine Georgian statehood and historically trying to turn Georgia into &quot;satellite or, in the worst scenario, a colonial country&quot;. Nevertheless, the document urged for the compromise and improving economic relations with Russia. Therefore, the documents have been described as reflecting &quot;ambivalence towards Russia&quot;. 

Under the Shevardnadze government, Georgia joined various Western economic and security organizations such as the OSCE, World Bank, IMF, PfP, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, the Council of Europe and the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, and signed military agreements with the USA. This culminated during the NATO Prague Summit in 2002 with Eduard Shevardnadze officially declaring the intent to become full member of NATO, which he called &quot;historic mission&quot;. 

The Shevardnadze&#x27;s tenure also saw deepening of the relations with Turkey and Azerbaijan, specifically over the construction of Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline, the development of TRACECA, partnership in BSEC and GUAM, trade and army trainings. The building of pipeline was also perceived as being opposed by Russia because it provided alternative to the Russian route for transferring the oil from the Caspian oil-fields, and therefore resulted in its lose of revenue and domination over the region.

The Georgia–Russia relations reached the boiling point during the Second Chechen War, with Russia accusing Georgia of harboring &quot;Chechen terrorists&quot; who escapted Chechnya to Georgia&#x27;s Pankisi Gorge. Georgia, on the other hand, accused Russia of violating its air space in Abkhazia. In December 2000, Russian President Vladimir Putin introduced visa regime for Georgian citizens ostensibly to prevent Chechen &quot;terrorists&quot; and &quot;criminal groups&quot; from re-entering Russia. The Georgian officials condemned this as an attempt to pressure the country to abandon the pro-Western policy. In his speech in 2000, President Shevardnadze condemned Russia for treating Georgia as a &quot;younger brother that can be listened to or ignored&quot; rather than a partner, and accused it of using the Pankisi Gorge crisis for &quot;unfriendly aims&quot;.

<text>The daxophone, invented by Hans Reichel, is an electric wooden experimental musical instrument of the friction idiophones category.

== Etymology ==
The &quot;dax&quot; in &quot;daxophone&quot; is derived from the German word &quot;Dachs&quot;, meaning &quot;badger&quot; and referencing the many animal sounds that the daxophone is capable of generating, changed to &quot;dax&quot; so that the instrument name echoes Adolphe Sax&#x27;s saxophone.

== History ==
The first usage of the daxophone in a musical work was the release of Hans Reichel&#x27;s album &quot;The Dawn of Dachsman&quot; in 1987.

== Construction ==
The daxophone consists of a wooden piece called a tongue, approximately 330 mm in length, 30 mm in width, and 5 mm in height, and fixed to a wooden block (often attached to a tripod, but also clamped to a table top), which holds one or more contact microphones. This wooden block has a cavity which is carved with a chisel for the insertion of two contact microphones, and a snakewood soundboard laid on top with the contact microphones glued to it. A wide range of voice-like timbres can be produced, depending on the shape of the tongue and the type of wood. The tongue shape is made with a coping saw, a scroll saw, or bandsaw. Denser woods such as ebony and oak produce a mellower sound than light woods. These sounds are notable for their comical, often human sounds.

Another vital part is the &quot;dax&quot;, sanded into a curved shape approximately 150 mm long and 50 mm tall, with a custom width tailored to the player&#x27;s hands, and curved on both sides to allow for frictionless pitch changing. One side of the dax is fretted according to a random logarithmic succession, while the other is left unfretted and covered with a sheet of cardboard for a mellower sound and to preserve the surface. Two large fingerholes are drilled through the sides.

Reichel has documented the construction of the instrument in a way that a skilled woodworker could build their own. Plans are downloadable from his website, with a collection of proven shapes for the tongue delivered in the file format of a font, thus playing on Reichel&#x27;s other profession as a typeface designer. 

== Usage ==

Normally, the daxophone is played by bowing the free end with a bow, most commonly a double bass bow, but it can also be struck or plucked, which propagates sound in the same way a ruler halfway off a table does. Vibrations then continue to the wooden-block base, which in turn is amplified by the contact microphone(s) therein. The timbre is adjusted by where it is bowed, and where along its length it is stopped with the &quot;dax&quot;. One side of the dax is fretted according to a randomly chosen logarithmic succession. The frequency interval between each fret in the succession will change due to the difference in pitch range between tongues, which is why the unfretted side is more frequently used for playing tonally in known compositions.

==In popular culture==
The 2022 horror film &quot;Smile&quot; features the daxophone as the lead instrument in its music score.

The 2024 supernatural mystery film &quot;The Watchers&quot;, directed by Ishana Night Shymalan and scored by Abel Korzeniowski, features daxophone on nearly every track of the score. It is the first time sections of daxophones have been used as an orchestral texture. The daxophones made for this film score were built by luthier John C.L. Jansen, and feature a new type of extended contrabass tongue, developed and built by the request of the composer.

<text>STS-32 was the 33rd mission of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program, and the ninth launch of . Launched on January 9, 1990, it marked the first use of Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A since 1986; it also marked the first use of Mobile Launcher Platform-3 (MLP-3) in the Space Shuttle program. STS-32 was, at the time, the longest shuttle mission yet conducted, with a duration of nearly 11 days. Before STS-32, the only mission of the same duration had been STS-9 in 1983. On January 20, 1990, STS-32 executed the third night landing of the shuttle program. STS-32 was also the first Shuttle mission of the 1990s.

The mission was technically designated STS-32R, as the original STS-32 designator had been used internally for STS-61-C, the 24th Space Shuttle mission. Official documentation and flight paperwork for that mission had contained the designator STS-32 throughout. Flights with the STS-26 through STS-33 designators used the R in their documentation to avoid conflicts in tracking data from one mission to another.

== Crew ==
=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Launch preparations ==
STS-32 marked the inaugural launch from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A following an extensive refurbishment. The pad, which had been inactive since the STS-61-C mission in 1986, underwent significant modifications to enhance safety and operational efficiency. These improvements encompassed upgrades to the crew emergency egress system and shuttle payload bay, increasing anti-freeze protection for water systems, as well as the integration of debris traps for propellant loading and enhanced weather protection measures. A new umbilical system was also installed to provide power, instrumentation, and control for the solid rocket booster field joint heaters.

Concurrently, Mobile Launcher Platform-3 (MLP-3), a legacy structure from the Apollo program, was substantially retrofitted for shuttle operations. This process involved removing the umbilical tower, reconfiguring exhaust vents, and modernizing electrical and mechanical ground support systems.

== Mission summary ==

STS-32 launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, on January 9, 1990, at 7:35:00 a.m. EST. The launch was initially scheduled for December 18, 1989, but was later postponed to allow the modifications to Pad A to be completed and verified. The second scheduled launch, on January 8, 1990, was aborted due to weather conditions. &quot;Columbia&quot; had a mission launch weight of . 
The primary objectives of the mission were to deploy the Syncom IV-F5 military communications satellite (also known as Leasat 5), and to retrieve NASA&#x27;s Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), whose retrieval had been delayed for 4 years by scheduling changes and the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster of 1986. Syncom IV-F5 (Leasat-5) was deployed on the second flight day, and a third-stage Minuteman solid apogee kick motor propelled it into a geosynchronous orbit. Dunbar retrieved the LDEF on the fourth day of the flight using the shuttle&#x27;s Remote Manipulator System (Canadarm). The timeliness of the retrieval was of critical importance, because a high rate of solar flux had increased the density of the LDEF&#x27;s orbital environment and accelerated its rate of orbital decay. Specialists who carefully monitored the stability of the craft&#x27;s orbit had anticipated that if the LDEF was not retrieved in time, it would pass too low for the shuttle to safely reach, and could be destroyed during re-entry in February 1990. Thus, the mission&#x27;s exact liftoff time was determined about 12 hours before launch, using the latest tracking data on LDEF. It was flown on a orbit inclined 28.45° to the equator.

The crew performed a 4-hour photographic survey of the free-flying structure, which held 57 science, technology and applications experiments. The 12-sided cylinder, about the size of a small satellite bus, was then berthed in the orbiter&#x27;s payload bay for return to Earth.

NASA had planned to acquire data on the crew members&#x27; exposure to long periods of zero gravity, and its effects on the crew&#x27;s performance while landing the orbiter after an extended mission. STS-32 set a new shuttle duration record of nearly eleven days. An orbiter kit was developed to allow the shuttle to operate for up to 16 days in Earth orbit, and would later make its debut on &quot;Columbia&quot;″s STS-50 mission in 1992.

The retrieval of LDEF was filmed with an IMAX camera, and appeared in the IMAX film &quot;Destiny in Space&quot; in 1994. Earth observation footage from the camera also appeared in the 1990 film &quot;Blue Planet&quot;.

&quot;Columbia&quot; landed safely on January 20, 1990, at 1:35:37 a.m. PST on Runway 22 of Edwards Air Force Base, California. The orbiter had a landing weight of . The roll-out distance was , and the roll-out time was 62seconds. The orbiter returned to KSC on January 26, 1990.

=== Mid-deck payloads ===
In addition to the Syncom IV-F5 (Leasat-5) satellite, STS-32 carried a number of mid-deck scientific payloads, some of which had already been flown on previous shuttle missions. The experiments included: 
== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

== Mission insignia ==
The three stars on the left and two stars on the right of STS-32&#x27;s insignia symbolized the flight&#x27;s numerical designation in the Space Transportation System&#x27;s mission sequence. The inverted orbiter on the mission patch reflects the overhead phasing required for rendezvous with LDEF. LDEF had dropped to such a low altitude that the orbiter could not do the usual lower-orbit catch-up because of the thicker atmosphere, and had to reach the LDEF from above.

<doc id="421278" wikidata="Q1076166" url="?curid=421278" title="Drúedain">
<text>The Drúedain are a fictional race of Men, living in the Drúadan Forest, in the Middle-earth legendarium created by J. R. R. Tolkien. They were counted among the Edain who made their way into Beleriand in the First Age, and were friendly to the Elves. In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, they assist the Riders of Rohan to avoid ambush on the way to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.

The Drúedain are based on the mythological woodwoses, the wild men of the woods of Britain and Europe; the Riders of Rohan indeed call them woses.

== Names and etymology ==

Within Tolkien&#x27;s fiction, the Drúedain call themselves &quot;Drughu&quot;. When the Drúedain settled in Beleriand, the Sindarin Elves adapted this to &quot;Drû&quot; (plurals &quot;Drúin&quot;, &quot;Drúath&quot;) and later added the suffix &quot;-adan&quot; &quot;man&quot;, resulting in the usual Sindarin form &quot;Drúadan&quot; (plural &quot;Drúedain&quot;). Tolkien also used the form &quot;Drûg&quot;, with a regular English plural &quot;Drûgs&quot;. &quot;Drughu&quot; became &quot;Rú&quot; in Quenya, with the later suffixed form &quot;Rúatan&quot; (plural &quot;Rúatani&quot;). The Orcs called the Drúedain &quot;Oghor-hai&quot;. John S. Ryan, writing in &quot;Mallorn&quot;, notes that Tolkien also uses the forms &quot;Drúadan Forest&quot; (the home of the Woses) and &quot;Drúwaith-laur&quot; (the Dru-folk&#x27;s ancient wilderness).

The word used for the Drúedain by the Rohirrim during the Third Age is represented by Tolkien as &quot;Púkel-men&quot;. This includes the Old English word &quot;&quot; &quot;goblin, troll&quot;, which survives in Shakespeare&#x27;s Puck in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and in two forms in Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Puck of Pook&#x27;s Hill&quot;. Ryan adds that the word survives in English placenames such as Puckshot in Surrey, Pock Field in Cumberland, Puxton, Puckeridge, Pokesdown, Pockford, Pucknall, and perhaps Pucklechurch. Ryan suggests that the Púkel-men may derive from a combination of &quot;Proto-Celts, Druid-figures, or ... roadside fertility deities&quot;. Ryan notes Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s statement that the name Púkel-men is &quot;also used as a general equivalent to Drúedain&quot;.

In Westron, the Common Tongue of western Middle-earth, the Drúedain were called the &quot;Wild Men&quot;, or the &quot;[Wood-]Woses&quot;: 

The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey, a philologist like Tolkien, notes that the office at Leeds University which both men used (at different times), is near Woodhouse Moor, which, as &quot;would not have escaped Tolkien&quot;, is a modern misspelling of Wood-Wose, Old English &quot;wudu-wāsa&quot;. Clark Hall renders this word as &quot;faun, satyr&quot;.

== Description==

The Drúedain somewhat resemble Dwarves in stature and endurance; they are stumpy, clumsy-limbed with short, thick legs, and fat, &quot;gnarled&quot; arms, broad chests, fat bellies, and heavy buttocks. According to the Elves and other Men, they had &quot;unlovely faces&quot;: wide, flat, and expressionless with deep-set black eyes that glowed red when angered. They had &quot;horny&quot; brows, flat noses, wide mouths, and sparse, lank hair. They had no hair lower than the eyebrows, except for a few men who had a tail of black hair on the chin. They were short-lived and had a deep hatred of Orcs. They had certain magical powers and sat still in meditation for long periods.

== History ==

The Drûgs were the first to migrate from Hildórien, the land where the race of Men awoke in the east of Middle-earth. Initially they headed south, into Harad, but then they turned north-west, becoming the first Men to cross the great river Anduin. Many of them settled in the White Mountains, where they were the first people. 

Some of the Drúedain continued north-west, settling in Beleriand. There a band lived among the Second House of Men, the Haladin, in the First Age in the forest of Brethil, whence the Elves came to know and love them. 
Aghan the Drûg is a protagonist in &quot;The Faithful Stone&quot;, a short story set in Beleriand in the First Age.

Although a number of the Drúedain came with the Edain to Númenor, they had left or died out before the Akallabêth, as had the Púkel-men of Dunharrow. At the end of the Third Age the Drûgs still lived in the Drúadan Forest of the White Mountains, and on the long cape of Andrast west of Gondor. The region north of Andrast was still known as Drúwaith Iaur, or &quot;Old Drûg land&quot;.

The term &quot;Púkel-men&quot; used by the Rohirrim was also applied to the statues constructed by the Drúedain to guard important places and homes; some evidently had the power to come to life. Because of their ugly appearance and frightening statues the Drúedain were feared and loathed by other Men of the region; they were considered little better than Orcs, and there was much enmity between those peoples.

Nevertheless, the Drúedain of Ghân-buri-Ghân&#x27;s clan came to the aid of the Rohirrim during the War of the Ring. A large company of Orcs had been sent to the Drúadan Forest to waylay the host of Rohan as it made its way to the aid of Gondor. It was the &quot;woodcrafty beyond compare&quot; Drúedain who held off the Orcs with poisoned arrows whilst they guided the Rohirrim through the forest by secret paths. Without their help the Rohirrim would not have arrived at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, and Sauron would likely have triumphed. This action earned the Drúedain the respect of other Men, and King Elessar granted them the Drúadan Forest &quot;forever&quot; in thanks.

==Significance==


Ghân-buri-Ghân is perceived as a &quot;leftover,&quot; a prehistoric type of human surviving in the modern world. Like the rest of his people, Ghân has a flat face, dark eyes, and wears only a grass skirt. He is seen as a good man with a kind of primitive nobility, a classic example of the noble savage. He is by no means stupid, and he &quot;refuses to be patronized.&quot; Susan Pesznecker describes the &quot;Wodwoses&quot;, including Tolkien&#x27;s, as a variant of the medieval Green man, which she calls &quot;a Pagan symbol of fertility and rebirth&quot;. 

The medievalist and Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger comments that the Wild Man &quot;is infantile&quot;. Ghân-Buri-Ghân talks &quot;like a Hollywood Tarzan&quot; using short broken phrases like &quot;Wild Men live here before Stone-houses&quot; and &quot;kill orc-folk&quot;. She compares him with the &quot;Wild Hobbit&quot; Gollum, who is psychotic, haunted by voices, and who uses &quot;baby-talk&quot;, like &quot;cruel little hobbitses&quot;: in her view, the Wild Man is &quot;evolutionarily regressive&quot;, whereas Gollum is &quot;psychologically regressive&quot;.

== Adaptations ==

Ghân-buri-Ghân is featured in the promotional expansion card set of &quot;The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game&quot; and in the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; board game. The image for the latter was designed by the Tolkien illustrator and concept designer John Howe.

<text>The Story of the Stone () is a novel by Barry Hughart, first published in 1988. It is part of a series set in a version of ancient China that began with &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot; and continues with &quot;Eight Skilled Gentlemen&quot;. The story begins on the twelfth day of the seventh moon in the Year of the Snake 3,339 (AD 650).

==Plot summary==
The abbot of a humble monastery in the Valley of Sorrows calls upon Master Li and Number Ten Ox to investigate the killing of a monk and the theft of a seemingly inconsequential manuscript from its library. Suspicion soon lands on the infamous Laughing Prince Liu Sheng—who has been dead for about 750 years. To solve this mystery and others, the incongruous duo will have to travel across China, outwit a half-barbarian king, and saunter into (and out of) Hell itself.

== Plot ==
A wild funeral and a storm presage an attempt on Li Kao&#x27;s life by a man disguised as a gambler. Number Ten Ox dumps the body in a canal. A footnote remarks that volumes two through five of the &quot;Memoirs of Number Ten Ox&quot; were seized and burnt by the Imperial Censors. Later in the Wineshop of One-eyed Wong, a low dive where classes mix, they encounter Lady Hou, a poet whose poems have been &quot;attributed&quot; to Yang Wan-Li. She attempts to murder a bureaucrat, but is knocked out by Wong. The trembling abbot of a humble monastery in the Valley of Sorrows approaches and asks them to investigate the killing of a monk and the theft of a strange manuscript from its library. He also says that The Laughing Prince, who has been dead for about 750 years, has arisen from his grave.

Later, they walk through the part of Peking known as Heaven&#x27;s Bridge, a crime filled area. Master Li spots a robbery in progress and makes a detour to Fire Horse Park, specifically to the Eye of Tranquility, a small lake surrounded by old sinners hoping for salvation, following the tradition of Chiang Taikung, a Taoist who fished without worms. Li Kao wrings a confession about the mushrooms from a toadish fellow named Hsiang. He identifies the manuscript fragment as a Ssu-ma Ch&#x27;ien, but an obvious forgery. It has also been traced recently.

Three days later they arrive at the Valley of Sorrows. Li Kao tells the story of Prince Liu Sheng, younger brother of Emperor Wu-ti. He was appointed as lord of Dragon Head Valley. He had the peasants plant gourds, and used the seeds to burn in horn lamps to light a salt mine. He used the brine and an area of shale that seeped an odorless, easily ignited gas to dry the salt. When the salt ran out, he had work started on mining a vein of iron ore. He set up an Iron Works that used a combination of acids to produce a less brittle form of iron. The suffering of the peasants sent him into gales of laughter. At that time he became known as The Laughing Prince.

The acids had a queer effect on the water of the valley. It turned bright yellow and glowed violet at night and fish, birds and trees in the valley died. Protests were silenced when he showed that he had made quite a lot of money from it all. Then he lost all interest in making money and turned his interest to medicine. He vivisected a large number of subjects (including those who protested) and gathered like-minded people around him. He dubbed them his Monks of Mirth, and they helped him gather subjects. After a while, he fell ill and died, raving that he would return from the grave to finish the destruction of the valley.

The autopsy of Brother Squint-Eyes reveals a normal corpse that died of fright. It also reveals that he had feasted during a recent trip to Ch&#x27;ang-an. They visit the devastated Princes&#x27; Path, a flowered path whose upkeep is paid for by the Laughing Prince&#x27;s fortune. The abbot tells them that the prince&#x27;s descendant Liu Pao wishes to meet them. The peasants also wish them to be certain that the Laughing Prince is still in his tomb.

The estate is large but rundown, with a large garden and many birds. Oddly enough, the Family Tablets are not there as they enter, but instead a plaque containing an essay by Chen Chiju, titled &quot;The Home Garden&quot;, one of the Four Pillars of Civilization. The prince proves to be a tall, skinny man with wild hair.

They discuss the case so far and Liu Pao shows them his ancestor&#x27;s tomb. The family tablets are within the grotto where the Laughing Prince conducted his experiments. It also contains a large slate board where curious experiments mention a Stone.

A poem is carved over the tablets:

They enter the tomb. The tomb is a small, barren room with two stone coffins, containing also his principal wife Tou Wan. The expected mummies are in the coffins.

In the village, the Feast of the Hungry Ghosts is beginning, it being the 15th day of the seventh moon.
Despite the festivities, Master Li is worried. He speculates that the laughing of the Laughing Prince was due to mercury poisoning, likely due to experiments with the Elixir of Life. Suddenly a mysterious sound is heard by Number Ten Ox that Li Kao cannot hear. Master Li climbs onto Number Ten Ox&#x27;s back and tells him to follow the sound. He does, running blindly into a thick mist, finally emerging on the Prince&#x27;s estate, having somehow crossed a deep gorge without knowing.

An alarm rings out in the monastery. The library has been ransacked and the room of Brother Squint-Eyes has been trashed. The corpse of another monk is discovered in the library, Brother Wu Shang, also frightened to death. Another section of the path is found destroyed. Number Ten Ox sketches characters from Great Seal script in the air and recounts an insight from a strange dream he had recently.

The peasants begin to sing a work song from the Book of Odes, indicating that they require the Prince to destroy his ancestor&#x27;s remains in the Pre-Confucian manner (punishable in the Eighth Hell).

With the deed done and the mummy smashed to pieces, the Prince shows them his paintings. The Prince studied with Three Incomparables, master of the p&#x27;o-mo (魄莫) style. Most of his paintings step outside those recommended in Mustard Seed Garden, an accumulated one and a half million years of exile.

Master Li becomes suspicious about the fragment and discovers that it is actually real and that the &#x27;mistakes&#x27; are actually clues, such as the number of a dragon&#x27;s scales (146, actually 153), the number of points in acupuncture (253, actually about 360) and so on. The decoded message reveals the location of the Stone. Master Li also reveals the mummy in Liu Sheng&#x27;s tomb had the wrong color wrappings, imperial yellow instead of mourning white, meaning that the mummy was not that of Liu Sheng.

On the way to the cold room, they see a painting of Liu Sheng. His clothing contains all twelve buttons of rank and one other, commonly used to represent the Second Lord of Heaven, placing him in line with the Jade Emperor.

Number Ten Ox deduces where the entrance to the tunnel is and after some hard work, break into Liu Sheng&#x27;s real tomb. The first chamber contains the skeletons of the workers. An iron wall is the next obstacle, but Number Ten Ox manages to make a hole in it. The next chamber is of marble and is stacked with gold and jewels. Other rooms contain the skeletons of the rest of Liu Sheng&#x27;s court, but the Monks of Mirth are nowhere to be found. Beyond the throne room is Liu Sheng&#x27;s real coffins, and the sacristy. The same mysterious inscription is there, but the Stone is not. The Laughing Prince&#x27;s coffin is empty. Master Li deduces that there is another entrance to the tomb, since the air within was breathable.

Since revealing the treasure would cause enormous problems, they decide to hide it again. Li Kao and Number Ten Ox leave for Ch&#x27;ang-an. The capital is an overwhelming experience for Ox. While at the Brush Forest Academy (dropping off samples of the dead plants for analysis), Master Li tells the tale of Hong Wong, the young genius who was too smart for his own good. The Neo-Confucians are in power and innovation is anathema. Next he visits The Gate of the Beautiful Vista, headquarters of the Secret Service and seeks an audience with the Captain of Prostitutes. They play a game of social shuttlecock, a quoting game. He wins and asks her to direct him to a soundmaster. She gives him the name of Moon Boy, who is presently at the court of Shih Hu, the King of Chao. She loans him Grief of Dawn, the one person who can control Moon Boy. In return she asks that he find a new patron deity for prostitutes. Golden Lotus was the best, and her successors have been poor substitutes. She asks that he recommend the late Empress Wu, which he takes umbrage at. Ox becomes entranced with Grief of Dawn. The group are given postal service horses and leave.

During the long journey, they learn that Grief of Dawn has no memory of her life before she was about 18. She was found covered in blood by an old woman who later raised her. Master Li gets in by pretending to be the Greatest Living Master of the Wen-Wu lute. The king sees through the imposture, but is pleased with the performance. He collects rare people, of which Moon Boy is the jewel.

The group settle in and the king serenades Grief of Dawn, as he wants her to join his all-female group of bodyguards, the Golden Girls. Ox and Grief of Dawn go off to be alone.

The next morning, Ox and Grief of Dawn are interrupted in their love play by Moon Boy. Ox decides that Moon Boy is named after the Rabbit in the Moon, a notorious pervert. Moon Boy leaves, but they are again interrupted by Master Li.

They sneak away under cover of one of Moon Boy&#x27;s performances. 100 toads glutted with Chinese lantern-flies clear out the stables and they make their escape through the kings secret exit. They dodge pursuit by boating to Loshan down the Min, past the Three Gorges and over Five Misery Rapids, past the Leshan Giant Buddha.

They then travel back to Ch&#x27;ang-an, past the village where Moon Boy was raised, resulting in some unusual scenes.
Grief of Dawn&#x27;s odd manners and knowledge, part peasant, part courtier are remarked on by Master Li. The samples show no traces of anything beyond natural decay. They make a visit to Serpentine Park, where Master Li cleverly obtains rubbings of the Confucian Stones. He later alters them to appear to be forgeries (changing the old form of the character to its newer form) and trades them at the Pavilion of the Blessings of Heaven, a library, for the tracings sold by Brother Squint-Eyes.

Later, reclining under a tree, Master Li asks Ox to tell the story of Li Ling-chi, about an emperor who wanted tangerines in winter and was so expert in manipulating c-hi that he was able to pull the tangerine trees from where they were growing in the south and cause them to grow in the north. Master Li then reads a story from a scroll containing the frame story of &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;, concerning a legend of Nü Kua, a sentient Stone and an evil flower named Purple Pearl. The flawed stone gains an evil soul from the handling of the goddess. It wanders around heaven causing mischief, until the Jade Emperor brought it in contact with Purple Pearl. The stone brought water to nourish the flower, which exorcised the evil, causing the flower to fall in love with the stone. It vowed to do the same for the stone. Later the stone returned to earth. Lao Tzu briefly possessed it, but hurled it away, crying &quot;Evil!&quot;, as did Chuang Tzu.

The deciphered text agrees, citing a tablet from the &quot;Cave of Yu&quot; and gives a description of the appearance of the stone and that Ssu-ma Ch&#x27;ien had attempted to destroy the stone with an axe, splitting it in three pieces. It asks scholars to destroy the stone, as soldiers could not.

Master Li wonders about the sound and the destruction of Princes&#x27; Path. Moon Boy explains that the sound was likely related to the phenomenon of the soul-sound of stone (Lithophone).

Ox learns of the story of Wolf Boy and Fire Girl from the local boy&#x27;s society. The plot deals with an attempt to kill the Laughing Prince, and includes a fragment of text similar to that found in the sacristy.

A clue in the tale leads them to a hidden cave and the bodies of two gardeners who vanished 33 years ago. They explore the caves passages fruitlessly and emerge just as King Shih Hu and his Golden Girls catch up to them. Grief of Dawn is wounded in the struggle and the King and his Golden Girls depart sorrowfully.

Grief of Dawn mutters in her fever, saying strange things that leave Master Li confused. To heal her, he requires the seeds of a Bombay thorn apple. They stop at the abandoned Unicorn Hall, to look at a portrait of Tou Wan, specifically her hairpin, which had a point fashioned from stone.

They arrive at the Temple of Illusion. Master Li intends that they take a voyage inside his mind, to rediscover the location of the thorn apple, which he has forgotten in the 60 years since. The three sit in a room in the temple and have a meal of wine and devil&#x27;s ear mushrooms. A plaque has the story of the Butterfly Dream. The mushrooms begin to take effect and they are directed to the garden.

Master Li converses with a skull in a patch of reeds, which write in the air, communicating the thoughts of Liu Ling. The two talk of old times and Master Li tells it he wishes Moon Boy to look in a certain mirror. The skull is apprehensive since only three others (Emperor T&#x27;ang, Chou the Rouge and Crazy Ch&#x27;i) have returned from the trip.

The trio enter Hell and successfully bypass the first gate to the levels of Feng-tu by impersonating an official inspector with his retinue, made possible by the Neo-Confucians having taken over the running of the place. Number Ten Ox&#x27;s look in the mirror reveals this to be his first human incarnation. Moon Boy, however, is the most recent on an attempt to reform a seriously evil soul. Li also discovers that the Laughing prince has yet to arrive in Hell. Eventually, they trick their way out of Hell, arriving back in the garden where they started, with the location of the apple.

The potion works and Grief of Dawn is restored to health. The things she mentioned in her fever seem to confirm that she was Tou Wan&#x27;s maid in a previous incarnation almost 800 years ago. He also concludes that the story of Wolf Boy and Fire girl has some basis in fact. Li mesmerizes Grief of Dawn to bring up her buried memories of how she escaped from the caves. She stops at a large boulder, which has a hidden door.

They descend steps to an underground river with large stone statues at intervals of death gods from various cultures, like Yen-wang-yeh, Emma-hoo, Gilgamesh, Osiris and others. They climb a steep flight of steps and emerge in an antechamber with four statues holding four canopic jars in Chinese style and four doors. The first door leads to the tomb, where they discover that Tou Wan&#x27;s Hairpin, which had a piece of the Stone, is indeed missing. The next door leads to a room containing the Laughing Prince&#x27;s medical research. He was using the Stone to chart the patterns of ch&#x27;i and shih. The third door leads to a series of polished chutes that exit in the underground river. Lio Pau is not there and they find tassels from his robe leading up a flight of stairs to a side passage. Moon Boy produces the illusion that they have entered and the roof of the tunnel collapses.

They climb the staircase and accidentally discover a secret door leading into the paymaster&#x27;s office. The fourth door leads to a sloping tunnel and a cavern where the Monks of Mirth are celebrating the Festival of Laughter. One is placed on Number Ten Ox&#x27;s back and starts to squeeze his neck. The monks are revealed as living corpses and the one on his back is the Laughing Prince. He manages to oil the corpse and squeeze it off. He hacks it to pieces with an axe, but the pieces continue to speak and move. Finally he lights it with a torch and the monks cease to move. Master Li recovers the Stone from the Laughing Prince, where it had revitalized his corpse after his death.

They are approached by Girl of Fire, who claims to know the location of Prince Liu Pao, but she tricks them into entering a collapsing cave. Grief of Dawn is killed but Moon Boy refuses to leave her body, instead carrying her to safety. They are then reunited with Girl of Fire. Master Li realises that she is actually the Prince in disguise. Liu Pao had wanted the power of the Stone, which he kept hung around his neck. The stone is a natural inkstone. 

They manage to kill Liu Pao by using the Kung Shang Chueh call, thus knocking him off the gorge. 

It is revealed Moon Boy is the stunningly beautiful reincarnated Purple Pearl. When the Stone stumbled upon Purple Pearl all those years ago, it washed away all the evil Purple Pearl had succumbed to. In return, Purple Pearl vowed to do the same to the Stone. After discovering this, Moon Boy fulfills the vow and commits suicide to be with Grief of Dawn.

==Reviews==

&quot;Library Journal&quot; stated that &quot;This sequel to &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot; (Del Rey, 1985) reaffirms Hughart&#x27;s gift for comic fantasy as well as his talent for ingenious storytelling.&quot;

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated that &quot;the sly humorous tone and affectionate homage to our western ideas of early China are what really make Hughart special.&quot; Hughart &quot;also incorporates a good deal of actual Chinese lore; the very title of his book, and various incidental details, pay homage to the most famous Chinese novel, more familiarly known as &quot;The Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;.

&quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; described the book as &quot;Intricately nested plot boxes [which] reveal and conceal mysterious Oriental characters - people and calligraphy alike.&quot;

<doc id="421292" wikidata="Q450429" url="?curid=421292" title="Grace Jones">
<text>Grace Beverly Jones (born 19 May 1948) is a Jamaican singer, songwriter, model and actress. She began her modelling career in New York state, then in Paris, working for fashion houses such as Yves St. Laurent and Kenzo, and appearing on the covers of &quot;Elle&quot; and &quot;Vogue&quot;. She notably worked with photographers such as Jean-Paul Goude, Helmut Newton, Guy Bourdin, and Hans Feurer, and became known for her distinctive androgynous appearance and bold features.

Beginning in 1977, Jones embarked on a music career, securing a record deal with Island Records and initially becoming a high-profile figure of New York City&#x27;s Studio 54-centered disco scene. In the early 1980s, she moved toward a new wave style that drew on reggae, funk, post-punk, and pop music, frequently collaborating with both the graphic designer Jean-Paul Goude and the musical duo Sly &amp; Robbie. She scored Top 40 entries on the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Private Life&quot;, &quot;Pull Up to the Bumper&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Seen That Face Before&quot;, and &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot;. In 1982, she released the music video collection &quot;A One Man Show&quot;, directed by Goude, which earned her a nomination for Best Video Album at the 26th Annual Grammy Awards. Her most popular albums include &quot;Warm Leatherette&quot; (1980), &quot;Nightclubbing&quot; (1981), and &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot; (1985).

As an actress, Jones appeared in several indie films prior to landing her first mainstream appearance as Zula in the fantasy-action film &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; (1984) alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sarah Douglas, and subsequently appeared in the James Bond movie &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985) as May Day, and starred as a vampire in &quot;Vamp&quot; (1986); all of which earned her nominations for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. In 1992, Jones acted in the Eddie Murphy film &quot;Boomerang&quot;, and contributed to the soundtrack. She also appeared alongside Tim Curry in the 2001 film &quot;Wolf Girl&quot;.

Jones was ranked 82nd on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll&quot; (1999). In 2008, she was honored with a Q Idol Award. Jones influenced the cross-dressing movement of the 1980s and has been cited as an inspiration for multiple artists, including Annie Lennox, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Solange, Lorde, Róisín Murphy, Brazilian Girls, Nile Rodgers, Santigold, and Basement Jaxx. In 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked her as the 40th greatest dance club artist of all time.

==Biography and career==
===1948–1973: Early life and modeling career===
Grace Jones was born in 1948 (though most sources say 1952) in Spanish Town, Jamaica, to Marjorie (née Williams) (1927–2017) and Robert W. Jones (1925–2008), who was a local politician and Apostolic clergyman. The couple already had two children, and would go on to have four more. Robert and Marjorie moved to the East Coast of the United States, where Robert worked as an agricultural labourer until a spiritual experience during a suicide attempt inspired him to become a Pentecostal minister. While they were in the US, they left their children with Marjorie&#x27;s mother and her new husband, Peart. Jones knew him as &quot;Mas P&quot; (&#x27;Master P&#x27;) and later noted that she &quot;absolutely hated him&quot;; as a strict disciplinarian he regularly beat the children in his care, representing what Jones described as &quot;serious abuse&quot;. She was raised into the family&#x27;s Pentecostal faith, having to take part in prayer meetings and Bible readings every night. She initially attended the Pentecostal All Saints School, before being sent to a nearby public school.
As a child, Jones was shy and had only one schoolfriend. She was teased by classmates for her &quot;skinny frame&quot;, but she excelled at sports and found solace in the nature of Jamaica.

Marjorie and Robert eventually brought their children – including the 13 year-old Grace – to live with them in the US, where they had settled in Lyncourt, Salina, New York, near Syracuse. It was in the city that her father had established his own ministry, the Apostolic Church of Jesus Christ, in 1956. Jones continued her schooling and after she graduated, enrolled at Onondaga Community College majoring in Spanish. Jones began to rebel against her parents and their religion; she began wearing makeup, drinking alcohol, and visiting gay clubs with her brother. At college, she also took a theatre class, with her drama teacher convincing her to join him on a summer stock tour in Philadelphia. Arriving in the city, she decided to stay there, immersing herself in the Counterculture of the 1960s by living in hippie communes, earning money as a go-go dancer, and using LSD and other drugs. She later praised the use of LSD as &quot;a very important part of my emotional growth... The mental exercise was good for me&quot;.

She moved back to New York at 18 and signed on as a model with Wilhelmina Models. She moved to Paris in 1970. The Parisian fashion scene was receptive to Jones&#x27;s unusual, androgynous, bold, dark-skinned appearance. Yves St. Laurent, Claude Montana, and Kenzo Takada hired her for runway modelling, and she appeared on the covers of &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, and &quot;Stern&quot; working with Helmut Newton, Guy Bourdin, and Hans Feurer. Jones also modelled for Azzedine Alaia, and was frequently photographed promoting his line. While modelling in Paris, she met Jerry Hall and Jessica Lange. Hall and Jones frequented Le Sept, one of Paris&#x27;s most popular gay clubs of the 1970s and 1980s, and socialised with Giorgio Armani and Karl Lagerfeld. In 1973, Jones appeared on the cover of a reissue of Billy Paul&#x27;s 1970 album &quot;Ebony Woman&quot;.

===1974–1979: Transition to music and early releases===

Jones was signed by Island Records, who put her in the studio with disco record producer Tom Moulton. Moulton worked at Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, and &quot;Portfolio&quot;, was released in 1977. The album featured three songs from Broadway musicals, &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot; by Stephen Sondheim from &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;, &quot;What I Did for Love&quot; from &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow&quot; from &quot;Annie&quot;. The second side of the album opens up with a seven-minute reinterpretation of Édith Piaf&#x27;s followed by three new recordings, two of which were co-written by Jones, &quot;Sorry&quot;, and &quot;That&#x27;s the Trouble&quot;. The album finished with &quot;I Need a Man&quot;, Jones&#x27;s first club hit. The artwork to the album was designed by Richard Bernstein, an artist for &quot;Interview&quot;.

In 1978, Jones and Moulton made &quot;Fame&quot;, an immediate follow-up to &quot;Portfolio&quot;, also recorded at Sigma Sound Studios. The album featured another reinterpretation of a French classic, &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; by Jacques Prévert. The Canadian edition of the vinyl album included another French-language track, , which replaced &quot;All on a Summers Night&quot;; in most locations this song served as the B-side of the single &quot;Do or Die&quot;. In the North American club scene, &quot;Fame&quot; was a hit album and the &quot;Do or Die&quot;/&quot;Pride&quot;/&quot;Fame&quot; side reached top 10 on both the US Hot Dance Club Play and Canadian Dance/Urban charts. The album was released on compact disc in the early 1990s, but soon went out of print. In 2011, it was released and remastered by Gold Legion, a record company that specialises in reissuing classic disco albums on CD.

Jones&#x27;s live shows were highly sexualized and flamboyant, leading her to be called &quot;Queen of the Gay Discos&quot;.

In the same year she was cast in the highly controversial Italian TV program &quot;Stryx&quot;, aired by Rai 2, where she portrayed the character of Rumstryx.

&quot;Muse&quot; was the last of Jones&#x27;s disco albums. The album features a re-recorded version &quot;I&#x27;ll Find My Way to You&quot;, which Jones released three years prior to &quot;Muse&quot;. Originally appearing in the 1976 Italian film, &quot;Colt 38 Special Squad&quot; in which Jones had a role as a club singer, Jones also recorded a song called &quot;Again and Again&quot; that was featured in the film. Both songs were produced by composer Stelvio Cipriani. Icelandic keyboardist Thor Baldursson arranged most of the album and also sang duet with Jones on the track &quot;Suffer&quot;. Like the last two albums, the cover art is by Richard Bernstein. Like &quot;Fame&quot;, &quot;Muse&quot; was later released by Gold Legion.

=== 1980–1985: Breakthrough, &quot;Nightclubbing&quot;, and acting ===
With anti-disco sentiment spreading, and with the aid of the Compass Point All Stars, Jones transitioned into new wave music with the 1980 release of &quot;Warm Leatherette&quot;. The album included covers of songs by The Normal (&quot;Warm Leatherette&quot;), The Pretenders (&quot;Private Life&quot;), Roxy Music (&quot;Love Is the Drug&quot;), Smokey Robinson (&quot;The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game&quot;), Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers (&quot;Breakdown&quot;) and Jacques Higelin (&quot;Pars&quot;). Sly Dunbar revealed that the title track was also the first to be recorded with Jones. Tom Petty wrote the lyrics to &quot;Breakdown&quot;, and he also wrote the third verse of Jones&#x27;s reinterpretation. The album included one song co-written by Jones, &quot;A Rolling Stone&quot;. Originally, &quot;Pull Up to the Bumper&quot; was to be included on the album, but its R&amp;B sound did not fit with the rest of the material. By 1981, she had begun collaborating with photographer and graphic designer Jean-Paul Goude, with whom she also had a relationship. An extended version of &quot;Private Life&quot; was released as a single, with a cover of the Joy Division song &quot;She&#x27;s Lost Control&quot;, a non-album track, as the B-side.

The 1981 release of &quot;Nightclubbing&quot; included Jones&#x27;s covers of songs by Flash and the Pan (&quot;Walking in the Rain&quot;), Bill Withers (&quot;Use Me&quot;), Iggy Pop/David Bowie (&quot;Nightclubbing&quot;) and Ástor Piazzolla (&quot;I&#x27;ve Seen That Face Before&quot;). Three songs were co-written by Jones: &quot;Feel Up&quot;, &quot;Art Groupie&quot; and &quot;Pull Up to the Bumper&quot;. Sting wrote &quot;Demolition Man&quot;; he later recorded it with The Police on the album &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ve Done It Again&quot; was written by Marianne Faithfull. The strong rhythm featured on &quot;Nightclubbing&quot; was produced by Compass Point All Stars, including Sly and Robbie, Wally Badarou, Mikey Chung, Uziah &quot;Sticky&quot; Thompson and Barry Reynolds. The album entered in the Top 5 in four countries, and became Jones&#x27;s highest-ranking record on the US Billboard mainstream albums and R&amp;B charts.

&quot;Nightclubbing&quot; claimed the number 1 slot on &quot;NME&quot;″s Album of the Year list. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at No. 40 on its list of Best Albums of the 1980s. &quot;Nightclubbing&quot; is now widely considered Jones&#x27;s best studio album. The album&#x27;s cover art is a painting of Jones by Jean-Paul Goude. Jones is presented as a man wearing an Armani suit jacket, with a cigarette in her mouth and a flattop haircut. While promoting the album, Jones slapped chat-show host Russell Harty live on air after he had turned to interview other guests, making Jones feel she was being ignored.

Having already recorded two reggae-oriented albums under the production of Compass Point All Stars, Jones went to Nassau, Bahamas in 1982 and recorded &quot;Living My Life&quot;; the album resulted in Jones&#x27;s final contribution to the Compass Point trilogy, with only one cover, Melvin Van Peebles&#x27;s &quot;The Apple Stretching&quot;. The rest were original songs; &quot;Nipple to the Bottle&quot; was co-written with Sly Dunbar, and, apart from &quot;My Jamaican Guy&quot;, the other tracks were collaborations with Barry Reynolds. Despite receiving a limited single release, the title track was left off the album. Further session outtakes included &quot;Man Around the House&quot; (Jones, Reynolds) and a cover of &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, written by June Carter Cash and Merle Kilgore and popularized by Johnny Cash, both of which were included on the 1998 compilation &quot;Private Life: The Compass Point Sessions&quot;. The album&#x27;s cover art resulted from another Jones/Goude collaboration; the artwork has been described as being as famous as the music on the record. It features Jones&#x27;s disembodied head cut out from a photograph and pasted onto a white background. Jones&#x27;s head is sharpened, giving her head and face an angular shape. A piece of plaster is pasted over her left eyebrow, and her forehead is covered with drops of sweat.

Jones&#x27;s three albums under the production of the Compass Point All Stars resulted in Jones&#x27;s &quot;One Man Show&quot;, a performance art/pop theatre presentation devised by Goude and Jones in which she also performed tracks from the albums &quot;Portfolio&quot; (), &quot;Warm Leatherette&quot;, (&quot;Private Life&quot;, &quot;Warm Leatherette&quot;), &quot;Nightclubbing&quot; (&quot;Walking in the Rain&quot;, &quot;Feel Up&quot;, &quot;Demolition Man&quot;, &quot;Pull Up to the Bumper&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Seen That Face Before (Libertango)&quot;) and from &quot;Living My Life&quot;, &quot;My Jamaican Guy&quot; and the album&#x27;s title track. Jones dressed in elaborate costumes and masks (in the opening sequence as a gorilla) and alongside a series of Grace Jones lookalikes. A video version, filmed live in London and New York City and completed with some studio footage, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Long-Form Music Video the following year.

After the release of &quot;Living My Life&quot;, Jones took on the role of Zula the Amazonian in &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; (1984) and was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. In 1985, Jones starred as May Day, henchwoman to main antagonist Max Zorin in the 14th James Bond film &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;; Jones was also nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. That same year, she was featured on the Arcadia song &quot;Election Day&quot;. Jones was among the many stars to promote the Honda Scooter; other artists included Lou Reed, Adam Ant, and Miles Davis. Jones also, with her boyfriend Dolph Lundgren posed nude for &quot;Playboy&quot;.

===1986–1989: &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot;, &quot;Island Life&quot;, and further films===
After Jones&#x27;s success as a mainstream actress, she returned to the studio to work on &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot;, the last of her recordings for Island. Bruce Woolley, Simon Darlow, Stephen Lipson and Trevor Horn wrote the material, and it was produced by Horn and Lipson. It was a concept album that featured several interpretations of the title track. The project was originally intended for Frankie Goes to Hollywood as a follow-up to &quot;Relax&quot;, but was given to Jones. All eight tracks on the album featured excerpts from a conversation with Jones, speaking about many aspects of her life. The interview was conducted by journalist Paul Morley. The album features voice-overs from actor Ian McShane reciting passages from Jean-Paul Goude&#x27;s biography &quot;Jungle Fever&quot;. &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot; was successful in German-speaking countries and in the Netherlands, where it secured Top 10 placings. It reached number 12 on the UK Albums Chart in November 1985 and became the second-highest-ranking album released by Jones. Jones earned an MTV Video Music Award nomination for the title track&#x27;s music video.

After her success with &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot;, Island released &quot;Island Life&quot;, Jones&#x27;s first best-of compilation, which featured songs from most of her releases with Island (&quot;Portfolio&quot;, &quot;Fame&quot;, &quot;Warm Leatherette&quot;, &quot;Nightclubbing&quot;, &quot;Living My Life&quot; and &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot;). American writer and journalist Glenn O&#x27;Brien wrote the essay for the inlay booklet. The compilation charted in the UK, New Zealand and the United States. The artwork on the cover of the compilation was of another Jones/Goude collaboration; it featured Jones&#x27;s celestial body in a montage of separate images, following Goude&#x27;s ideas on creating credible illusions with his cut-and-paint technique. The body position is anatomically impossible.

The artwork, a piece called &quot;Nigger Arabesque&quot; was originally published in the &quot;New York&quot; magazine in 1978, and was used as a backdrop for the music video of Jones&#x27;s hit single . The artwork has been described as &quot;one of pop culture&#x27;s most famous photographs&quot;. The image was also parodied in Nicki Minaj&#x27;s 2011 music video for &quot;Stupid Hoe&quot;, in which Minaj mimicked the pose.

After &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot; and &quot;Island Life&quot;, Jones started to record again under a new contract with Manhattan Records, which resulted in &quot;Inside Story&quot;, Jones teamed up with music producer Nile Rodgers of Chic, whom Jones had previously tried to work with during the disco era. The album was recorded at Skyline Studios in New York and post-produced at Atlantic Studios and Sterling Sound. &quot;Inside Story&quot; was the first album Jones produced, which resulted in heated disputes with Rodgers. Musically, the album was more accessible than her previous albums with the Compass Point All Stars, and explored different styles of pop music, with undertones of jazz, gospel, and Caribbean sounds. All songs on the album were written by Jones and Bruce Woolley. Richard Bernstein teamed up with Jones again to provide the album&#x27;s artwork. &quot;Inside Story&quot; made the top 40 in several European countries. The album was Jones&#x27;s last entry to date on US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. The same year, Jones starred as Katrina, an Egyptian queen vampire in the vampire film &quot;Vamp&quot;. For her work in the film, Jones was awarded a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress.

In 1987, Jones appeared in two films, &quot;Straight to Hell&quot;, and Mary Lambert&#x27;s &quot;Siesta&quot;, for which Jones was nominated for Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress. &quot;Bulletproof Heart&quot; was released in 1989, produced by Chris Stanley, who co-wrote, and co-produced the majority of the songs, and was featured as a guest vocalist on &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Freedom&quot;. Robert Clivillés and David Cole of C+C Music Factory produced some tracks on the album.

===1990–2004: &quot;Boomerang&quot;, soundtracks, and collaborations===
In 1990, Jones appeared as herself in the documentary, &quot;Superstar: The Life and Times of Andy Warhol&quot;. 1992 saw Jones starring as Helen Strangé, in the Eddie Murphy film &quot;Boomerang&quot;, for which she also contributed the song &quot;7 Day Weekend&quot; to its soundtrack. Jones released two more soundtrack songs in 1992; &quot;Evilmainya&quot;, recorded for the film &quot;Freddie as F.R.O.7&quot;, and &quot;Let Joy and Innocence Prevail&quot; for the film &quot;Toys&quot;. In 1994, she was due to release an electro album titled &quot;Black Marilyn&quot; with artwork featuring the singer as Marilyn Monroe. &quot;Sex Drive&quot; was released as the first single in September 1993, but the album was shelved due to Jones disliking the mixes that were presented by producers, whom she felt were primarily interested in sampling and had &quot;minced&quot; her vocals. Jones stated that the experience turned her off working on music. The track &quot;Volunteer&quot;, recorded during the same sessions, leaked in 2009. In 1995, Jones reunited with Tom Moulton for a disco-house take on Candi Staton&#x27;s 1978 song &quot;Victim&quot;, however, the song&#x27;s release was cancelled by Island Records.

In 1996, Jones released &quot;Love Bites&quot;, an up-tempo electronic track to promote the Sci-Fi Channel&#x27;s &quot;Vampire Week&quot;, which consisted of a series of vampire-themed films aired on the channel in early November 1996. The track features Jones singing from the perspective of a vampire. The track was released as a non-label promo-only single. , it had not been made commercially available.

In June 1998, Jones was scheduled to release an album titled &quot;Force of Nature&quot;, on which she worked with trip hop musician Tricky. The release of &quot;Force of Nature&quot; was cancelled due to a disagreement between the two, and only a white label 12&quot; single featuring two dance mixes of &quot;Hurricane&quot; was issued at the time; a slowed-down version of this song became the title track of her comeback album released ten years later while another unreleased track from the album, &quot;Clandestine Affair&quot; (recycling the chorus from her unreleased 1993 track &quot;Volunteer&quot;), appeared on a bootleg 12&quot; in 2004. Jones recorded the track &quot;Storm&quot; in 1998 for the movie &quot;The Avengers&quot;, and in 1999, appeared in an episode of the &quot;Beastmaster&quot; television series as the Umpatra Warrior.

The same year, Jones recorded &quot;The Perfect Crime&quot;, an up-tempo song for Danish TV written by the composer duo Floppy M. aka Jacob Duus and Kåre Jacobsen. Jones was also ranked 82nd place on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Women of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;. In 2000, Jones collaborated with rapper Lil&#x27; Kim, appearing on the song &quot;Revolution&quot; from her album &quot;The Notorious K.I.M.&quot;. In 2001, Jones starred in the film, &quot;Wolf Girl&quot; (also known as &quot;Blood Moon&quot;), as an intersex circus performer named Christoph/Christine. In 2002, Jones joined Luciano Pavarotti on stage for his annual Pavarotti and Friends fundraiser concert to support the United Nations refugee agency&#x27;s programs for Angolan refugees in Zambia. In November 2004, Jones sang &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot; at a tribute concert for record producer Trevor Horn at London&#x27;s Wembley Arena.

===2008–2015: &quot;Hurricane&quot; and memoir===
Despite several comeback attempts throughout the 1990s, Jones&#x27;s next full-length record was released almost twenty years later, after Jones decided &quot;never to do an album again,&quot; changing her mind after meeting music producer Ivor Guest through a mutual friend, milliner Philip Treacy. After the two became acquainted, Guest let Jones listen to a track he had been working on, which became &quot;Devil in My Life&quot;, once Jones set the lyrics to the song. The lyrics to the song were written after a party in Venice.

The two ended up with 23 tracks. The album, &quot;Hurricane&quot;, included autobiographical songs, such as &quot;This Is&quot;, &quot;Williams&#x27; Blood&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Crying (Mother&#x27;s Tears)&quot;, an ode to her mother Marjorie. &quot;Love You to Life&quot; was another track based on real events and &quot;Corporate Cannibal&quot; referred to corporate capitalism. &quot;Well Well Well&quot; was recorded in memory of Alex Sadkin, member of Compass Point All Stars who had died in a motor accident 1987. &quot;Sunset Sunrise&quot; was written by Jones&#x27;s son, Paulo; the song ponders the relationship between mankind and mother nature. Four songs were removed from the album, &quot;The Key to Funky&quot;, &quot;Body Phenomenon&quot;, &quot;Sister Sister&quot; and &quot;Misery&quot;. For the production of the album, Jones teamed up with Sly and Robbie, Wally Badarou, Barry Reynolds, Mikey Chung, and Uziah &quot;Sticky&quot; Thompson, of the Compass Point All Stars, with contributions from trip-hop artist Tricky, and Brian Eno.

The album was released on Wall of Sound on 3 November 2008, in the United Kingdom. PIAS, the umbrella company of Wall of Sound, distributed &quot;Hurricane&quot; worldwide excluding North America. The album scored 72 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, Jones performed at Massive Attack&#x27;s Meltdown festival in London on 19 June 2008, Jones performed four new songs from the album and premiered the music video which Jones and artist Nick Hooker collaborated on, which resulted in &quot;Corporate Cannibal&quot;. Jones promoted the album even further by appearing on talk show &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;, performed at several awards galas, and embarked on &quot;The Hurricane Tour&quot;. The same year, Jones was honoured with Q Idol Award.
In 2009, Chris Cunningham produced a fashion shoot for &quot;Dazed &amp; Confused&quot; using Jones as a model to create &quot;Nubian versions&quot; of Rubber Johnny. In an interview for BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Culture Show&quot;, it was suggested that the collaboration may expand into a video project. Jones also worked with the avant-garde poet Brigitte Fontaine on a duet named &quot;Soufi&quot; from Fontaine&#x27;s album &quot;Prohibition&quot; released in 2009, and produced by Ivor Guest.

In March 2010 Jones performed for guests at the 18th annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Award Viewing Party. The Elton John AIDS Foundation is one of the world&#x27;s leading nonprofit organisations supporting HIV prevention programs, and works to eliminate the stigma and discrimination associated with HIV/AIDS. The event raised US$3.7 million. The same year, a budget DVD version of &quot;A One Man Show&quot; was released, as &quot;Grace Jones – Live in Concert&quot;. It included three bonus video clips (&quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot;, &quot;Love Is the Drug&quot; and &quot;Crush&quot;).

In 2011, Jones collaborated again with Brigitte Fontaine on two tracks from her release entitled and performed at the opening ceremony of the 61st FIFA Congress. Jones released a dub version of the album, &quot;Hurricane – Dub&quot;, which came out on 5 September 2011. The dub versions were made by Ivor Guest, with contributions from Adam Green, Frank Byng, Robert Logan and Ben Cowan.

In April 2012, Jones joined Deborah Harry, Bebel Gilberto, and Sharon Stone at the Inspiration Gala in São Paulo, Brazil, raising $1.3 million for amfAR (the Foundation for AIDS Research). Jones closed the evening with a performance of and &quot;Pull Up to the Bumper&quot;. Two months later, Jones performed &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot; at the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II (whilst keeping a hula hoop spinning round her waist throughout), and the Lovebox Festival. On 27 October 2012, Jones performed her only North American show of 2012, a performance at New York City&#x27;s Roseland Ballroom. The same year, Jones presented Sir Tom Jones with not only the &quot;GQ&quot; Men of the Year award, but her underwear. Tom Jones accepted the gift in good humour, and replied by saying, &quot;I didn&#x27;t think you wore any&quot;.

Universal Music Group released a deluxe edition of her &quot;Nightclubbing&quot; album as a two-disc set and Blu-ray audio on 28 April 2014. The set contains most of the 12&quot; mixes of singles from that album, plus two previously unreleased tracks from the &quot;Nightclubbing&quot; sessions, including a cover of the Gary Numan track &quot;Me! I Disconnect from You&quot;.

In October 2014, Jones was announced as having contributed a song, &quot;Original Beast&quot;, to the soundtrack of &quot;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1&quot;.

Jones&#x27;s memoir entitled &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Write My Memoirs&quot; was released on 29 September 2015.

===2017–present: Collaborations and festivals===

In 2017, Jones collaborated with British virtual band Gorillaz, appearing on the song &quot;Charger&quot; from their fifth studio album &quot;Humanz&quot;.

In October 2018, Jones received the Order of Jamaica from the Jamaican government.

In June 2022, Jones served as curator of the 27th edition of the Meltdown Festival, the UK&#x27;s longest-running artist-curated music festival. Jones had been announced as the curator already for the 2020 festival, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic it was rescheduled to 2022. During her show that closed the festival, Jones announced that a brand new &#x27;African hybrid&#x27; record was in production, and previewed &quot;The Sun Shines in Wartime&quot; (or &quot;Sunshine In Wartime) and &quot;Blacker Than Black&quot; (or &quot;Born Black&quot;) from the album.

Jones provided guest vocals on Beyoncé&#x27;s song &quot;Move&quot; from her seventh studio album &quot;Renaissance&quot;, released in July 2022.

On 14 November 2022, music festival Camp Bestival announced their 2023 lineup, which included Jones, alongside Primal Scream, Melanie C, Craig David, The Kooks, the Human League, and others.

On 23 July 2023, Jones headlined the music acts at Bluedot Festival. 

==Artistry and influence==
===Image===

Jones&#x27; &quot;appearance was equally divisive&quot; as the sonic fluidity of her music - with her &quot;striking visuals [leading] to her becoming a muse for the likes of Issey Miyake and Thierry Mugler. Her image has been described as &quot;neo-cubist&quot;. Jones&#x27;s distinctive androgynous appearance, square-cut, angular padded clothing, manner, and height of 179 cm (5′ ″) influenced the cross-dressing movement of the 1980s. To this day, she is known for her unique look at least as much as she is for her music and has been an inspiration for numerous artists, including Annie Lennox, Lorde, Rihanna, Janelle Monáe, and Nile Rodgers. Jones was listed as one of the 50 best-dressed over 50 by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in March 2013. 

Kyle Munzenrieder of &quot;W&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;everyone from Madonna to Björk to Beyoncé to Lady Gaga has taken more than a few pages from her playbook&quot;. Jones&#x27;s work is often discussed for its visual aspect, which was largely the work of French illustrator, photographer, and graphic designer Jean-Paul Goude. According to Jake Hall of &quot;i-D&quot;, &quot;their collaborative work [went on] to define the visual landscape of the 70s and 80s,&quot; and Goude &quot;helped create one of the most intriguing legends in musical history.&quot; Goude saw Jones as his muse, declaring she was &quot;beautiful and grotesque at the same time,&quot; and dated her from 1977 to 1984. He &quot;[designed her] album covers, [...] directed her music videos, choreographed live performances, and helped develop her image.&quot;

Jones was featured prominently in Goude&#x27;s work from that period, &quot;which, over the course of the &#x27;80s, became increasingly synonymous with willful distortion&quot; - using a technique he refers to as &quot;French correction&quot;. The artist stated in 2012: &quot;chopping up photos and rearranging them in a montage to elongate limbs or exaggerate the size of someone&#x27;s head or some other aspect appealed to me on a lot of levels – I&#x27;m always searching for equilibrium, symmetry, and rhythm in an image.&quot; Goude&#x27;s work &quot;centers around artistic depictions of race, ethnicity, and global culture&quot;, with an &quot;enchantment with the far-away and the exotic&quot;. As a result, much of his depictions of black women are considered controversial and exploitative, as Jones was presented as &quot;a white man&#x27;s rendition of the African feminine.&quot; Goude&#x27;s images depicted her hypersexualized and androgynous, emphasizing her &quot;blackness&quot; and Jamaican heritage. Writer Abigail Gardner felt Jones&#x27; body &quot;was presented and manipulated in ways that are clearly congruent with conceiving of that display as artefactual.&quot; Essentially, Hall writes, &quot;Goude treated Jones as an artistic vehicle first and foremost - a hyperbole which, despite destroying their personal relationship, allowed Goude to translate his grandiose vision of Jones the phenomenon into a series of imagery which painted her as a surreal, impossible muse.&quot;

It has been noted that Jones&#x27; ties with the 1970s and 1980s New York art scene are important in understanding her visual identity during this period, and she was close to Andy Warhol, who created a number of paintings and other works of the singer. She also knew artist Richard Bernstein, and artist and social activist Keith Haring, who painted her head-to-toe for a series of photographs taken by Robert Mapplethorpe and for her role in the 1986 film &quot;Vamp&quot;.

In 2020, the first ever art exhibition centred around Jones was presented at Nottingham Contemporary in the United Kingdom, in an attempt to represent &quot;a multi-faceted pop culture icon while trying to reformulate an alternative image of Grace Jones that does not fall into clichés.&quot;

===Music===
&quot;Vice&quot; described Jones&#x27;s musical output as &quot;weird, vibrant and progressive,&quot; stating that she &quot;has woven disco, new wave, post-punk, art pop, industrial, reggae, and gospel into a tight sound that is distinctly hers, threaded together with lilting, powerful vocals.&quot; Her early music was rooted in disco. She opted for a new wave sound in the early 1980s. She recorded a series of albums (1980&#x27;s &quot;Warm Leatherette&quot; through 1982&#x27;s &quot;Living My Life&quot;) backed by the Jamaica rhythm section duo Sly and Robbie. Her music during this era was described as a new wave hybrid of reggae, funk, pop, and rock. According to John Doran of BBC Music, &quot;Warm Leatherette&quot; and &quot;Nightclubbing&quot; were &quot;post-punk pop&quot; albums that, &quot;delved into the worlds of disco, reggae and funk much more successfully than most of her &#x27;alternative&#x27; contemporaries, while still retaining a blank-eyed alienation that was more reminiscent of David Bowie or Ian Curtis than most of her peers.&quot;

Jones has a contralto vocal range. She sings in two modes: either in her monotone speak-sing voice as in songs such as &quot;Private Life&quot;, &quot;Walking in the Rain&quot; and &quot;The Apple Stretching&quot;, or in an almost-soprano mode in songs such as &quot;La Vie en Rose&quot;, &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot;, and &quot;Victor Should Have Been a Jazz Musician&quot;.

==Personal life==
Jones&#x27;s father, Bishop Robert W. Jones, was strict and their relationship was strained. According to his particular denomination&#x27;s beliefs, one should only use one&#x27;s singing ability to glorify God. He died on 7 May 2008. Her mother, Marjorie, always supported Jones&#x27;s career (she sings on &quot;Williams&#x27; Blood&quot; and &quot;My Jamaican Guy&quot;) but could not be publicly associated with her music. Marjorie&#x27;s father, John Williams, was also a musician and played with Nat King Cole.

Jones described her childhood as having been &quot;crushed underneath the Bible&quot;, and since has refused to enter a Jamaican church due to her bad childhood experiences.

Jones used the surname &quot;Mendoza&quot; in her 20s, so that her parents would not know that she was working as a go-go dancer.

Through her relationship with longtime collaborator Jean-Paul Goude, Jones has one son, Paulo, born 12 November 1979. From Paulo, Jones has one granddaughter. Jones married Atila Altaunbay in 1996. She disputes rumors that she married Chris Stanley in her 2015 memoir &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Write My Memoirs&quot;, saying, &quot;The truth is, I only ever married one of my boyfriends, Atila Altaunbay, a Muslim from Turkey.&quot; She spent four years with Swedish actor Dolph Lundgren, her former bodyguard; she got him a part as a KGB officer in &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985). Jones started dating Danish actor and stuntman Sven-Ole Thorsen in 1990, and was in an open relationship as of 2007.

Jones&#x27;s brother is megachurch preacher Bishop Noel Jones, who starred on the 2013 reality show &quot;Preachers of LA&quot;.

<doc id="421305" wikidata="Q3838075" url="?curid=421305" title="The Blue Lamp">
<text>The Blue Lamp is a 1950 British police procedural film directed by Basil Dearden and starring Jack Warner as PC Dixon, Jimmy Hanley as newcomer PC Mitchell, and Dirk Bogarde as criminal Tom Riley. 

The title refers to the blue lamps that traditionally hung outside British police stations (and often still do). The film became the inspiration for the 1955–1976 TV series &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, where Jack Warner continued to play PC Dixon until he was 80 years old (even though Dixon is murdered in the original film).

The screenplay was written by Ealing regular T. E. B. Clarke, who had been a war reserve constable. The film is an early example of the &quot;social realism&quot; films that emerged later in the 1950s and 1960s, sometimes using a partial documentary-like approach. There are also cinematic influences of the film noir genre, particularly in underworld scenes featuring Bogarde&#x27;s Tom Riley, such as the pool rooms and in and around the theatre, making deliberate use of genre trademarks like slow moving low camera angles and stark lighting. The plot, however, follows a simple moral structure in which the police are the honest guardians of a decent society, battling the disorganised crime of a few unruly youths. The film was set in London, and partly shot on locations there.

==Plot==
The action mostly takes place in the Paddington area of west London and is set in July 1949, a few years after the end of the Second World War. PC George Dixon, a long-serving traditional &quot;copper&quot; who is due to retire shortly, supervises a new recruit, Andy Mitchell, introducing him to the night beat.

Dixon is a classic Ealing &quot;ordinary&quot; hero, but also anachronistic, unprepared and unable to answer the violence of Tom Riley. Called to the scene of a robbery at a local cinema, Dixon finds himself face-to-face with Riley, a desperate youth armed with a revolver. Dixon tries to talk Riley into surrendering the weapon, but Riley panics and fires. Dixon dies in hospital some hours later.

On his beat, Mitchell notices a little girl playing with a revolver, which turns out to be the discarded murder weapon. The child is eventually persuaded to lead police to the spot where she found it. Police painstakingly drag a canal and come up with a raincoat that is traced to Diana Lewis&#x27; father, who remembers loaning it to Riley.

In his arrogance, Riley goes to Police Headquarters to provide a false alibi for himself. All this accomplishes is to convince the police to place him under 24-hour watch.

Riley is caught with the help of professional criminals and dog-track bookmakers who identify the murderer as he tries to hide in the crowd at White City greyhound track in west London. Credit for arresting Riley falls to young Andy Mitchell.

The ensemble cast also included uncredited actors who later became better known in film, television and radio, including Alma Cogan, Glyn Houston, Jennifer Jayne, Glen Michael, Arthur Mullard, Norman Shelley, Rosemary Nicols (in her film debut as a street urchin) and Campbell Singer.

==Production==
The character of &quot;Diana&quot; was initially envisioned with Diana Dors in mind, to the extent that the character&#x27;s name was derived from her own. Nevertheless, the producers harboured reservations about Dors&#x27;s suitability for the role, citing concerns regarding her emotional maturity. Consequently, a decision was made by the director to pivot away from Dors and opt for a &quot;waif type&quot; persona, leading to the casting of Peggy Evans for the character.

The production had the full co-operation of the Metropolitan Police, and the crew was thus able to use the real-life former Paddington Green Police Station, then at 64 Harrow Road, London W9 and New Scotland Yard for location work. Most of the other outdoor scenes were filmed in inner west London, principally the Harrow Road precincts between Paddington and Westbourne Park. George Dixon is named after producer Michael Balcon&#x27;s former school in Birmingham.

==Locations used==
The original blue lamp was transferred to the new Paddington Green Police Station. It is still outside the front of the station and was restored in the early 21st century. Most of the locations around the police station are unrecognisable now due to building of the Marylebone flyover. The police station at 325 Harrow Road, not far from the site of the Coliseum Cinema (324–326 Harrow Road), which is also shown in the film, has a reproduction blue lamp at its entrance.

The Metropolitan Theatre of Varieties, featured prominently at the start of the film, was demolished because it was thought likely that the Marylebone flyover would need the site, although that turned out not to be the case. It is now the site of Paddington Green Police Station. The scene involving a robbery on a jeweller&#x27;s shop was filmed at the nearby branch of national chain, F. Hinds (then at 290 Edgware Road). This was also knocked down when the flyover was built.

The scenes of the cinema robbery were filmed at the Coliseum Cinema on Harrow Road, next to the Grand Union Canal bridge. The cinema was probably built in 1922, was closed in 1956 and later demolished. The site is now occupied by an office of Paddington Churches Housing Association.

Some of the streets used, or seen, in the film include: Harrow Road W2 and W9, Bishop&#x27;s Bridge Road W2, Westbourne Terrace Bridge Road W9, Delamere Terrace, Blomfield Road, Formosa Street, Lord Hill&#x27;s Road, Kinnaird Street and Senior Street W2, Ladbroke Grove W10, Portobello Road W11, Latimer Road, Sterne Street W12 and Hythe Road NW10. The church which features prominently towards the end is St Mary Magdalene, Senior Street W2. Most of the streets around the church were demolished in the 1960s to make way for the new Warwick Estate in Little Venice. 

Tom Riley&#x27;s home was in the run-down street of Amberley Mews, north of the canal, and is now the site of Ellwood Court, part of the Amberley Estate. It is from this mews that Riley walks into Formosa Street, then crosses the Halfpenny Bridge. He then goes into Diana Lewis&#x27;s flat on the corner of Delamere Terrace and Lord Hill&#x27;s Road where he attacks her and is chased out by the following detective. Then follows one of the first extended car chases in British film. The route of the chase is as follows: Senior Street W2, Clarendon Crescent W2, Harrow Road W9, Ladbroke Grove W10, Portobello Road W11, Ladbroke Grove W10, Royal Crescent W10, Portland Road W10, Penzance Place W10, Freston Road W10, Hythe Road NW10, Sterne Street W12 – then a chase on foot into Wood Lane and then to White City Stadium. Most of the chase is a logical following of Riley&#x27;s car apart from when the car goes from Hythe Road NW10 into Sterne Street – Hythe Road in 1949 was a dead end.

==Reception==
===Critical===
&quot;The Blue Lamp&quot; premiered on 20 January 1950 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London, and the reviewer for &quot;The Times&quot; found the depiction of the police work very plausible and realistic, and praised the performances of Dirk Bogarde and Peggy Evans, but found Jack Warner&#x27;s and Jimmy Hanley&#x27;s two policemen portrayed in a too traditional way: &quot;There is an indefinable feel of the theatrical backcloth behind their words and actions ... The sense that the policemen they are acting are not policemen as they really are, but policemen as an indulgent tradition has chosen to think they are, will not be banished.&quot;

In the context of a campaign against perceived &quot;middle-class complacency&quot; in British film-making, &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; editor Gavin Lambert (writing under a pseudonym) attacked the film&#x27;s &quot;specious brand of mediocrity&quot; and suggested the film was &quot;boring and parochial&quot;, views which caused outrage.

Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2007, Andrew Pulver called the film &quot;the most successful example of the rough-and-tough Brit crime thriller of the immediate postwar period.&quot;

===Box-office===
The film had the highest audiences in Britain for a British film that year. According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; the &quot;biggest winners&quot; at the box office in 1950 Britain were &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot;, &quot;The Happiest Days of Your Life&quot;, &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, &quot;The Wooden Horse&quot;, &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;Odette&quot;.

===Awards===
The film won the 1951 BAFTA Award for Best British Film and was nominated for the Golden Lion at the 1950 Venice Film Festival.

==Legacy==
In 1951, a stage play of the same name was written by Willis and Read. It ran for 32 performances at the Hippodrome in London. It also played the Hippodrome in Bristol. In 1952, the play ran for 192 performances in a summer season at the Grand Theatre, Blackpool, Lancashire. Gordon Harker took the role of George Dixon, while Jack Warner played Chief Inspector Cherry.

Several of the characters and actors were carried over into the TV series &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, including the resurrected Dixon, still played by Warner. The series ran on BBC Television (BBC1) for twenty-one years from 1955 to 1976, with Warner being over eighty by the time of its conclusion.

In 1988, Arthur Ellis&#x27;s satirical BBC Two play &quot;The Black and Blue Lamp&quot; had the film characters of Riley (Sean Chapman) and PC &quot;Taffy&quot; Hughes (Karl Johnson) transported forwards in time into an episode of &quot;The Filth&quot;, a gritty contemporary police television series, replacing their modern-day counterparts.

&quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier&quot; by Alan Moore and Kevin O&#x27;Neill has one panel suggesting a George Dixon died in August 1898, the time-period given for the first two graphic novels, as well as &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;.
There is a real George Dixon (1820–98) who was a Victorian politician whom Balcon&#x27;s school was named after.

In 2010, the BBC Television drama &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; concluded with a short clip of George Dixon, referring to the similarity to Dixon&#x27;s death in &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot; and subsequent resurrection for the television series and the underlying plot of the show.

<doc id="421306" wikidata="Q3883950" url="?curid=421306" title="Operation Colossus">
<text>Operation Colossus was the codename given to the first airborne operation undertaken by the British military, which occurred on 10 February 1941 during World War II. The British airborne establishment was formed in June 1940 by the order of the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, in response to the successful airborne operations conducted by the German military during the Battle of France. Training began immediately but a shortage of proper equipment and training facilities, as well as bureaucratic difficulties, meant that only a small number of volunteers could immediately be trained as parachute troops. The first airborne unit to be formed was actually a re-trained Commando unit, No. 2 Commando, which was subsequently renamed as No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion and numbered approximately 350 officers and other ranks by September 1940. The battalion finished its training in December 1940 and in February 1941 thirty-eight members of the battalion, known as X Troop, were selected to conduct an airborne operation, which was intended to test the capability of the airborne troops and their equipment, as well as the ability of the Royal Air Force to accurately deliver them.

The target chosen for the operation was a fresh-water aqueduct near Calitri in southern Italy, which supplied water to a large portion of the Italian population as well as several ports used by the Italian armed forces; it was also hoped that its destruction would hamper Italian military efforts in North Africa and Albania. The airborne troops were delivered by converted Armstrong Whitworth Whitley medium bombers to the target on 10 February but equipment failures and navigational errors meant that a significant portion of the troop&#x27;s explosives and a team of Royal Engineer sappers, landed in the wrong area. Despite this setback the remaining members of the troop destroyed the aqueduct and withdrew from the area. All were captured by the Italian authorities within a short time; an Italian translator was tortured and executed and one paratrooper managed to escape but the rest remained as prisoners of war. The aqueduct was rapidly repaired before local water reserves ran out, ensuring that the local population and the ports were not deprived of water and the Italian war effort was not hampered. The operation served as a morale boost for the fledgling airborne establishment and the technical and operational lessons learnt from the operation helped the development of later airborne operations.

==Background==
The German military was one of the pioneers of the use of airborne formations, conducting several successful airborne operations during the Battle of France in 1940, including the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael. Impressed by the success of German airborne operations, the Allied governments decided to form their own airborne formations. This decision would eventually lead to the creation of two British airborne divisions, as well as a number of smaller units. The British airborne establishment began development on 22 June 1940, when the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office in a memorandum to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops. Despite the Prime Minister&#x27;s desire to have 5,000 airborne troops within a short period, a number of problems were rapidly encountered by the War Office. Very few gliders existed in Britain in 1940, and these were too light for military purposes, and there was also a shortage of suitable transport aircraft to tow gliders and carry paratroopers. On 10 August, Churchill was informed that although 3,500 volunteers had been selected to train as airborne troops, only 500 could currently begin training due to limitations in equipment and aircraft. The War Office stated in a memorandum to the Prime Minister in December 1940 that 500 parachute troops could probably be trained and be ready for operations by the spring of 1941, but this figure was purely arbitrary; the actual number that could be trained and prepared by that period would rely entirely on the creation of a training establishment and the provision of required equipment.

A training establishment for parachute troops was set up at RAF Ringway near Manchester on 21 June 1940 and named the Central Landing Establishment, and the initial 500 volunteers began training for airborne operations. The Royal Air Force provided a number of Armstrong Whitworth Whitley medium bombers for conversion into transport aircraft for paratroopers. A number of military gliders were also designed, starting with the General Aircraft Hotspur, but gliders were not used by the British until Operation Freshman in 1942. Organizational plans were also being laid down, with the War Office calling for two parachute brigades to be operational by 1943. However, the immediate development of any further airborne formations, as well as the initial 500 volunteers already training, was hampered by three problems. With the threat of invasion in 1940, many War Office officials and senior British Army officers did not believe that sufficient men could be spared from the effort to rebuild the Army after the Battle of France to create an effective airborne force; many believed that such a force would only have a nuisance raiding value and would not affect the conflict in any useful way. There were also material problems; all three of the armed services were expanding and rebuilding, particularly the Army, and British industry had not yet been organized to a sufficient war footing to support all three services as well as the fledgling airborne force. Finally, the airborne forces lacked a single, coherent policy, with no clear idea as to how they should be organized, or whether they should come under the command of the Army or the RAF; inter-organizational rivalry between the War Office and the Air Ministry, in charge of the RAF, was a major factor in delaying the further expansion of British airborne forces.

==Preparation==
On 26 April 1941, the Prime Minister was shown a demonstration of the airborne force that Britain currently possessed, and was informed that although some 800 parachute troops had been trained, their deployment was severely limited by the lack of suitable aircraft which could be used to transport them to any prospective targets. The primary airborne formation in existence by this time was No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion, which numbered approximately 350 officers and other ranks, and had been formed from No. 2 Commando, a Commando unit which had been selected for conversion into an airborne unit. The Commando began intensive airborne training in June 1940, originally 500 strong, but this had been reduced to 21 officers and 321 other ranks by September 1940; despite already receiving rigorous training, many of the commandos failed their training by refusing to conduct a parachute drop. One senior RAF officer at the Central Landing Establishment believed that such a large number refused due to a combination of inexperience and a fear that their parachute would not open when they jumped out of the aircraft. On 21 November 1940 the Commando was officially renamed as No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion and reorganized to form a battalion headquarters, one parachute wing and one glider wing. By 17 December the battalion had officially completed its parachute training, including taking part in a number of demonstrations for military observers, and was considered to be ready for active duty.

There were few airborne resources available to the British Army by mid-1941. The only unit trained and available for an airborne operation was No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion, there were very few transport aircraft available to transport an airborne force, there were few RAF flight crews with experience of parachute droppings and none with operational experience, and there were no specialized overseas facilities to cater exclusively for airborne operations. However, it had been decided that some form of airborne operation would have to be carried out. The reason for mounting an operation with such meagre resources was that it would test the fighting ability of the battalion and its equipment, as well as the RAF&#x27;s ability to deliver paratroopers at a predetermined location at a required time. The target chosen for the operation was an aqueduct that crossed the Tragino river in the Campania province of southern Italy near the town of Calitri. The aqueduct carried the main water supply for the province of Apulia, which at the time was inhabited by approximately two million Italians and included the strategically important port of Taranto; it was hoped that destroying the aqueduct and depriving the population of their regular water supply would damage their morale, and also have some impact on the Italian war efforts in North Africa and Albania. The aqueduct was a significant distance from the Italian coast, making it unlikely that a sea-borne raiding party could reach it, and it was believed that it was too strongly constructed to be destroyed by aerial bombing; as such, an airborne raid conducted by parachute troops was thought to be the ideal way to eliminate the aqueduct.

A small force of thirty-eight menseven officers and thirty-one other rankswas selected from the battalion and designated X Troop, commanded by Major T.A.G. Pritchard of the Royal Welch Fusiliers. Three Italian-speaking interpreters were attached to the troop for the duration of the operation: Squadron Leader Lucky MC, Rifleman Nasri from the Rifle Brigade and a civilian named Fortunato Picchi, a deputy restaurant manager of the Savoy Hotel. Training for the operation began in January 1941 and lasted for six weeks, in order to allow time for six Whitley bombers to be converted to drop parachutists. A full-scale model of the aqueduct was built in early February to allow the troop to practice its assault, and during training one enlisted man was killed when he parachuted into an ice-covered pond and drowned before he could be rescued. The plan for the operation called for six Whitleys of No. 51 Squadron RAF to transport X Troop from Malta to the target area on 10 February, while another two bombers would carry out a diversionary raid against railway yards at Foggia, approximately to the north of the aqueduct. At 21:30 the troop would be dropped around the objective, attack and demolish it, and then withdraw to the coast to the mouth of the Sele River, where the submarine HMS &quot;Triumph&quot; would pick them up on the night of 15 February.

==The operation==
On 7 February X Troop boarded the six converted Whitley bombers and were transported to Malta without incident, despite a significant portion of the journey being over occupied France. There the troop were briefed with aerial reconnaissance photographs of the objective that were provided by the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit, which showed that there were actually two aqueducts in the area, one larger than the other; after a brief discussion it was decided that the larger of the two would be targeted.

At 18:30 on 10 February, the six Whitleys took off from Malta, each carrying one officer and five other ranks of X Troop; the flight to the target area was uneventful, with clear weather and perfect visibility. The lead Whitley reached the drop zone, which was approximately from the aqueduct, at 21:42. All six men and their equipment containers landed within of the drop zone, as did the men from the next four aircraft; however two of the bombers failed to drop their containers due to the icing up of the release mechanisms, and the sixth aircraft failed to locate the drop zone and eventually dropped its six men and containers two hours later in a valley two miles from the aqueduct. These six men were the Royal Engineer sappers who were supposed to rig the aqueduct for demolition, and their Whitley had been carrying most of the explosives. Despite these losses, the troop gathered up the remaining containers and took up positions around the aqueduct. However, on examining the aqueduct it was found the piers supporting it were made of reinforced concrete and not brick as had been expected, leading Pritchard to suspect that the remaining explosives might be insufficient to demolish the aqueduct. After closer inspection, Pritchard ordered that the majority of the explosives be placed around the western pier and the rest against its abutment, in the hope that this would cause enough damage to destroy the aqueduct. A small amount of explosives were also placed under a nearby bridge that bridged the &quot;Ginestra&quot; river.

At 00:30 on 11 February, the explosives were detonated and the western pier destroyed, causing the aqueduct to crumble and effectively break in half, and the Ginestra bridge was also successfully destroyed. Leaving one man who had broken his ankle when he had landed with a nearby farmer, the remainder of the Troop withdrew from the area at 01:00, splitting into three groups and heading towards the coast. The three groups moved as fast as possible towards the coast, but were all captured within a few hours of the aqueduct being demolished. The group commanded by Major Pritchard was spotted by a farmer, who raised the alarm at a nearby village, leading to a local carabinieri unit surrounding the group; with little ammunition and heavily outnumbered, Pritchard decided to surrender. The other three groups, including the six sappers, fared little better. The two groups from the aqueduct were soon located by Italian soldiers and ambushed, forcing them to surrender after brief firefights. The third group were found by a group of civilians as they moved towards the coast; after attempting to bluff their way past by claiming to be German soldiers on a special field exercise, which failed when the local mayor demanded identity papers, they were captured by carabinieri. All were stripped of their weapons and equipment and transported to the civilian prison of Naples and then to the POW camp of Sulmona, with the exception of the Italian translator, Picchi, who was taken to Rome, found guilty of treason by the high court of the Special Tribunal for the Defense of the State (&quot;Tribunale Speciale per la Difesa dello Stato&quot;) and shot at the military prison of Forte Bravetta (Rome) on 6 April 1941.

Even if any of the groups had managed to make their way to the coast and the rendezvous point, they would not have been picked up by HMS &quot;Triumph&quot;. One of the two Whitleys conducting the diversionary raid at Foggia had suffered engine trouble after bombing the railway yards. The pilot radioed Malta, informing his airfield that he was ditching in the mouth of the River Sele, coincidentally the area where the rendezvous was to occur. Fearing that the message had been monitored by the Italians and that the submarine might sail into a trap, the decision was made by senior officers not to send it to the rendezvous point.

==Aftermath==
The destruction of the Tragino aqueduct had a negligible effect on the Italian war effort in North Africa and Albania, as it did not create a serious interruption to the water supplies of Taranto and other ports; the water supplies in local reservoirs lasted for the short period needed for the aqueduct to be repaired. However, the operation did create a certain amount of alarm in the Italian population and caused stringent new air raid precautions to be introduced by the Italian government, which were still in place when Italy surrendered in 1943. The military historian Major General Julian Thompson criticized the operation. He claimed that although there was a great deal of planning in terms of how to insert the airborne troops, there was insufficient planning devoted to how they would be extracted. He also criticized the lack of information gathered about the aqueduct, despite it being &quot;hardly difficult to obtain.&quot;

Lessons taken from the operation provided the British military with valuable operational and technical experience that helped shape future airborne operations, such as Operation Biting. It demonstrated the range and flexibility of airborne troops and proved that they could pose a threat to the Axis powers, and also provided a morale boost for the British military and the fledgling airborne establishment. In terms of technical experience, it was found that the containers used to drop equipment for the troop were manufactured from a soft-skinned material, which sagged during flight and blocked the bomb bay doors from opening; future containers were constructed from metal to ensure this did not occur. All of the surviving members of X Troop would remain as prisoners of war until they were repatriated with the Italian surrender, with the exceptions of: Lieutenant Anthony Deane–Drummond and Sapper Alfred Parker. Deane-Drummond who managed to escape after being captured eventually returned to England in 1942, joining the newly formed 1st Airborne Division. Parker escaped from the Sulmona POW camp but was later recaptured by the Germans. After witnessing the execution by the Germans of a fellow escapee and a number of Italians (later recognized as a war atrocity), Parker again escaped and eventually made his way back to the UK after hitching a ride to North Africa on a US forces Dakota aircraft.

When the airborne establishment was expanded, No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion was renamed 1st Parachute Battalion, and eventually formed the nucleus of 1st Parachute Brigade when it was created in September 1941.

<text>Richard Ian Cox (born October 3, 1973) is a Welsh-born Canadian actor. He is best known for his voice work for English language dubs of anime, mainly for &quot;Inuyasha&quot;. Cox gained prominence for playing the character of Henry Dailey&#x27;s (played by Mickey Rooney) teenaged traveller and horse rider, Alec Ramsay, in The Family Channel&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of the Black Stallion&quot; during the early 1990s. Cox also gained fame for voicing Ian Kelley, the title character in the animated series &quot;Being Ian&quot; and for voicing Scattershot, one of the Autobots in the CGI-Animated series &quot;&quot;. In 2015, he provided the voice of Lofty in the American dubbed version of the 2015 reboot of the British children&#x27;s animated television series &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; taking over from both Sonya Leite, Emma Tate and Lizzie Waterworth. He had a prominent live action role alongside Robin Williams in the 2006 comedy &quot;RV&quot;. He maintains an active online presence on Tumblr and Twitter as well as Facebook. He hosts his own podcast called &quot;The Show&quot;.

==Career==
Born in St. Asaph, Wales, Cox began acting at the age of 9. He moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and at age 14 became a professional actor. After graduating from Vancouver&#x27;s Richmond Secondary School in 1991, he appeared in a wide variety of guest-starring roles. He is most commonly known for his voice work of Bit Cloud in &quot;&quot;, Ranma Saotome (male) in the later seasons of &quot;Ranma ½&quot;, and as the title character of &quot;InuYasha&quot;, which are both series based on the original manga works of Rumiko Takahashi.

By the time he was 16, he won the co-starring role in &quot;Black Stallion&quot;, opposite Mickey Rooney, where he worked for much of his youth. The two remained close friends, until Rooney&#x27;s death, in April 2014. He has also voiced various characters in several other anime series, including &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; (Kai Shiden), &quot;Galaxy Angel&quot; (Normad), &quot;Megaman NT Warrior&quot; (Burner Man) and &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; (Tolle Koenig and Shani Andras), as well as various American cartoon characters, such as Quicksilver in &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot; and Snails in &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic&quot;.

Based in Vancouver, Canada, Cox has made a few guest appearances in &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, as well as bit parts in series such as &quot;ER&quot; and &quot;Psych&quot;. He has also appeared on the Canadian television show &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; and voices Bedtime Bear in &quot;Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-Lot&quot;.

For over a decade, Cox was a senior instructor of actors at Tarlington Training in Vancouver, and currently teaches film acting at South Delta Secondary School.

He hosts &quot;The Show&quot;, an online radio show.

<text>Victor Pierre Horta (; Victor, Baron Horta after 1932; 6 January 1861 – 8 September 1947) was a Belgian architect and designer, and one of the founders of the Art Nouveau movement. He was a fervent admirer of the French architectural theorist Eugène Viollet-le-Duc and his Hôtel Tassel in Brussels (1892–93), often considered the first Art Nouveau house, is based on the work of Viollet-le-Duc. The curving stylized vegetal forms that Horta used in turn influenced many others, including the French architect Hector Guimard, who used it in the first Art Nouveau apartment building he designed in Paris and in the entrances he designed for the Paris Metro. He is also considered a precursor of modern architecture for his open floor plans and his innovative use of iron, steel and glass.

Horta&#x27;s later work moved away from Art Nouveau, and became more geometric and formal, with classical touches, such as columns. He made a highly original use of steel frames and skylights to bring light into the structures, open floor plans, and finely-designed decorative details. His later major works included the Maison du Peuple/Volkshuis (1895–1899), Brussels&#x27; Centre for Fine Arts (1923–1929) and Brussels-Central railway station (1913–1952). In 1932, King Albert I conferred on Horta the title of Baron for his services to the field of architecture.

After Art Nouveau lost favor, many of Horta&#x27;s buildings were abandoned, or even destroyed, though his work has since been rehabilitated. Four of the buildings he designed in Brussels were added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2000: the Hôtel Tassel, the Hôtel Solvay, the Hôtel van Eetvelde and the Horta House (currently the Horta Museum).

==Life and early work==
Victor Horta was born in Ghent, Belgium, on 6 January 1861. His father was a master shoemaker, who, as Horta recalled, considered craftsmanship a high form of art. The young Horta began by studying music at the Royal Conservatory of Ghent. He was expelled for misbehavior and went instead to study at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Ghent. At the Ghent Conservatory, an aula is named after him today. When he was seventeen, he moved to Paris and found work with the architect and designer Jules Debuysson.

Horta&#x27;s father died in 1880, and Horta returned to Belgium. He moved to Brussels and married his first wife, with whom he later fathered two daughters. He began to study architecture at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels. He became friends with Paul Hankar, another early pioneer of Art Nouveau architecture. Horta did well in his studies and was taken on as an assistant by his professor Alphonse Balat, the architect to King Leopold II. Horta worked with Balat on the construction of the Royal Greenhouses of Laeken in northern Brussels, Horta&#x27;s first work to utilise glass and iron. In 1884, Horta won the first Prix Godecharle to be awarded for architecture for a proposed new building for the Belgian Parliament. On his graduation from the Royal Academy, he was awarded the Grand Prize in architecture.

In the years that followed, Horta joined the Central Society of Belgian Architecture, designed and completed three houses in a traditional style, and took part in several competitions. In 1892, he was named head of the Department of Graphic Design for Architecture at the Free University of Brussels, and promoted to professor in 1893. At this time, through lectures and exhibitions organised by the artists&#x27; group Les XX, Horta became familiar with the British Arts and Crafts Movement, the developments in book design, and especially textiles and wallpaper, which influenced his later work.

In 1893, Horta built a town house, the Autrique House for his friend Eugène Autrique. The interior had a traditional floor plan, due to a limited budget, but the facade previewed some of the elements he developed into the full Art Nouveau style, including iron columns and ceramic floral designs. In 1894, Horta was elected President of the Central Society of Belgian Architecture, although he resigned the following year following a dispute caused when he was awarded the commission for a kindergarten on the / in the Marolles/Marollen district of Brussels, without a public competition.

Throughout his life, Horta was greatly influenced by the French architectural theorist Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, whose ideas he completely identified with. In 1925, he wrote: 

==The town houses and the beginning of Art Nouveau==

===Hôtel Tassel (1892–93)===
The major breakthrough for Horta came in 1892, when he was commissioned to design a home for the scientist and professor Émile Tassel. The Hôtel Tassel was completed in 1893. The stone facade, designed to harmonize with the neighboring buildings, was fairly traditional, but the interior was strikingly new. Horta used the technologies of glass and iron, which he had practiced on the Royal Greenhouses of Laeken, to create an interior filled with light and space. The house was built around an open central stairway. The interior decoration featured curling lines, modeled after vines and flowers, which were repeated in the ironwork railings of the stairway, in the tiles of the floor, in the glass of the doors and skylights, and painted on the walls. The building is widely recognized as one of the first appearances of Art Nouveau in architecture (along with the Hankar House by Paul Hankar, built at the same time). In 2000, it was designated, along with three other town houses designed soon afterwards, as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In designating these sites, UNESCO explained: &quot;The stylistic revolution represented by these works is characterised by their open plan, the diffusion of light, and the brilliant joining of the curved lines of decoration with the structure of the building.&quot;

===Hôtel Solvay (1895–1900)===
The Hôtel Solvay, on the Avenue Louise/Louizalaan in Brussels, was constructed for Armand Solvay, the son of the chemist and industrialist Ernest Solvay. Horta had a virtually unlimited budget, and used the most exotic materials in unusual combinations, such as marble, bronze and rare tropical woods in the stairway decoration. The stairway walls were decorated by the pointillist painter Théo van Rysselberghe. Horta designed every detail including the bronze doorbell and the house number, to match the overall style.

===Hôtel Van Eetvelde (1895–1901)===
The Hôtel van Eetvelde is considered one of Horta&#x27;s most accomplished and innovative buildings, because of highly original Winter Garden interior and the imaginative details throughout. The open floor plan of the Hôtel Van Eetvelde was particularly original, and offered an abundance of light, both horizontally and vertically, and a great sensation of space. A central court went up the height of the building, bringing light from the skylight above. On the main floor, the oval-shaped salons were open to the courtyard, and also received light from large bay windows. It was possible to look from one side of the building to other from any of the salons on the main floor.

===Horta House and Studio (1898–1901)===
The Horta House and Studio, now the Horta Museum, was Horta&#x27;s residence and office, and was certainly more modest than the other houses, but it had its own original features and equally fine craftsmanship and mastery of details. He made unusual combinations of materials, such as wood, iron and marble in the staircase decoration.

The novel element in Horta&#x27;s houses and then his larger buildings was his search for maximum transparency and light, something often difficult to achieve with the narrow building sites in Brussels. He achieved this by use of large windows, skylights, mirrors, and especially by his open floor plans, which brought in light from all sides and from above.

===Hôtel Aubecq (1899–1902)===
The Hôtel Aubecq in Brussels was one of his late houses, made for the industrialist Octave Aubecq. As with his other houses, it featured a skylight over the central staircase, filling the house with light. Its peculiarity was the octagonal shape of the rooms, and the three facades with windows, designed to give maximum light. The owner originally wished to keep his original family furniture, but because of the odd shape of the rooms, Horta was commissioned to create new furniture.

By 1948, Art Nouveau was out of style, the house was sold to a new owner, who wished to demolish it. A movement began to preserve the house, but in the end only the facade and the furnishings were saved by the City of Brussels. The facade was disassembled and put into storage, and many proposals were made for its reconstruction, but none were carried out. Some of the furnishings are now on display at the Musée d&#x27;Orsay in Paris.

===Maison du Peuple (1896–1899)===
While Horta was building luxurious town houses for the wealthy, he also applied his ideas to more functional buildings. From 1896 to 1899, he designed and built the Maison du Peuple/Volkshuis (&quot;House of the People&quot;), the headquarters for the Belgian Workers&#x27; Party (POB/BWP). This was a large structure including offices, meeting rooms, a café and a conference and concert hall seating over 2,000 people. It was a purely functional building, constructed of steel columns with curtain walls. Unlike his houses, there was virtually no decoration. The only recognizable Art Nouveau feature was a slight curving of the steel pillars supporting the roof. As with his houses, the building was designed to make a maximum use of light, with large skylights over the main meeting room. It was demolished in 1965, despite an international petition of protest by over 700 architects. The materials of the building were saved for possible reconstruction, but were eventually scattered around Brussels. Some parts were used for the construction of the Brussels Metro system.

Beginning in about 1900, Horta&#x27;s buildings gradually became more simplified in form, but always made with great attention to functionality and to craftsmanship. Beginning in 1903, he constructed the Grand Bazar Anspach, a large department store, with his characteristic use of large windows, open floors, and wrought iron decoration. In 1907, Horta designed the Museum for Fine Arts in Tournai, although it did not open until 1928 due to World War I.

===Magasins Waucquez (1905–06)===
The &quot;Magasins Waucquez&quot; (now the Belgian Comic Strip Center) was originally a department store specializing in textiles. In its design, Horta used all his skill with steel and glass to create dramatic open spaces and to give them an abundance of light from above. The steel and glass skylight is combined with decorative touches, such as neoclassical columns. After Waucquez&#x27;s death in 1920, the building began to languish away, and in 1970, the firm closed its doors. Jean Delhaye, a former aid of Horta, saved the building from demolition, and by 16 October 1975, because of its connection to Horta, it was declared a protected historical site. Now a museum of a particular Belgian speciality, the comic strip, it also has a room devoted to Horta.

===Brugmann University Hospital (1906)===
In 1906, Horta accepted the commission for the new Brugmann University Hospital (now the Victor Horta Site of the Brugmann University Hospital). Developed to take into account the views of the clinicians and hospital managers, Horta&#x27;s design separated the functions of the hospital into a number of low-rise pavilions spread over the park based campus, and work began in 1911. Although used during World War I, the official opening was delayed until 1923. Its unusual design and layout attracted great interest from the European medical community, and his buildings continue in use to this day.

==The First World War – travel to the United States==
In February 1915, as World War I was underway and Belgium was occupied, Horta moved to London and attended the Town Planning Conference on the Reconstruction of Belgium, organised by the International Garden Cities and Town Planning Association. Unable to return to Belgium, at the end of 1915, he traveled to the United States, where he gave a series of lectures at American universities, including Cornell, Harvard, MIT, Smith College, Wellesley College and Yale. In 1917, he was named Charles Eliot Norton Memorial Lecturer and Professor of Architecture at George Washington University.

==Later Projects – debut of modernism (1919–1939)==
On Horta&#x27;s return to Brussels in January 1919, he sold his home and workshop on the /, and also became a full member of the Belgian Royal Academy. The post-war austerity meant that Art Nouveau was no longer affordable or fashionable. From this point on, Horta, who had gradually been simplifying his style over the previous decade, no longer used organic forms, and instead based his designs on the geometrical. He continued to use rational floor plans, and to apply the latest developments in building technology and building services engineering. The Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels, a multi-purpose cultural centre designed in a more geometric style similar to Art Deco.

===Centre for Fine Arts (1923–1929)===
Horta developed the plans for the Centre for Fine Arts beginning in 1919, with construction starting in 1923. It was completed in 1929. It was originally intended to be built of stone, but Horta made a new plan of reinforced concrete with a steel frame. He had intended the concrete to be left exposed in the interior, but the final appearance did not meet his expectations, and he had it covered. The concert hall itself is in an unusual ovoid, or egg shape, and is accompanied by art galleries, meeting rooms, and other functional rooms. The building is placed on a complex hillside site, and occupies eight levels, much of it underground. It also had to be designed to avoid blocking the view from the Royal Palace, on the hill just above it.

In 1927, Horta became the Director of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels, a post he held for four years until 1931. In recognition of his work, Horta was awarded the title of Baron by King Albert I in 1932.

===Brussels-Central railway station (1913–1952)===

In 1910, Horta began working on drawings on his most ambitious and longest running project: Brussels-Central railway station. He was formally commissioned as the architect in 1913, but work did not actually begin until after World War II, in 1952. It was originally planned that the station would just part of a much larger redevelopment project, which Horta had conceived in the 1920s, but this was never realized.

The start of construction was seriously delayed due to the lengthy process of purchasing and demolishing over one thousand buildings along the route of the new railway between Brussels&#x27; main stations, and then because of World War I. Construction finally began in 1937 as part of the plans to boost the economy during the Great Depression, before being delayed again by the outbreak of World War II. Horta was still working on the station when he died in 1947. The station was finally completed, to his plans, by his colleagues led by Maxime Brunfaut. It opened on 4 October 1952.

==Furniture==
Horta typically designed not only the building but also the furniture to match his particular style. His furniture became as well known as his houses; a displays of his furniture were shown at the 1900 Universal Exposition in Paris, and the 1902 Turin Exposition of Modern Decorative Arts. It was typically hand-made, and the furniture for each house was different. In many cases the furniture lasted longer than the house. Its drawback was that, since it matched the house, it could not be changed to any other style, without disrupting the harmony of the room.

==Later work and personal life==
Horta and his first wife divorced in 1906. He married his second wife, Julia Carlsson, in 1908.

In 1925, he was an architect of honor for the Belgian Pavilion at the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris, the exposition which gave its name to Art Deco. In the same year, he became director of the Fine Arts section of the Belgian Royal Academy of Fine Arts.

In 1937, he completed the design of his final work, Brussels-Central railway station. In 1939, he began editing his memoirs. He died on 8 September 1947 and was interred in Ixelles Cemetery in Brussels.

===Heritage===
Art Nouveau fell out of fashion in the 20th century and many of Horta&#x27;s buildings were abandoned, or even destroyed, most notably the Maison du Peuple/Volkshuis, demolished in 1965, as mentioned above. However, several of Horta&#x27;s buildings are still standing in Brussels up to this day and some are available to tour. Most notable are the &quot;Magasins Waucquez&quot;, formerly a department store, now the Belgian Comic Strip Center and four of his private houses (&quot;hôtels&quot;), which were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000 under the title &quot;Major Town Houses of the Architect Victor Horta (Brussels)&quot;:
* Hôtel Tassel, designed and built for Prof. Émile Tassel in 1892–93
* Hôtel Solvay, designed and built in 1895–1900
* Hôtel van Eetvelde, designed and built in 1895–1901
* Horta House and Studio, designed and built in 1898–1901, now the Horta Museum, dedicated to his work

==Honors==
* 1919 
** Officer of the Order of the Crown.
** Member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium

* 1925: Director of the Classe des Beaux-Arts of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium

Horta was commemorated on the Belgian 2000 franc banknote issued from 1994 until the introduction of the euro.

<text>Jorge Amado ( 10 August 1912 – 6 August 2001) was a Brazilian writer of the modernist school. He remains the best-known of modern Brazilian writers, with his work having been translated into some 49 languages and popularized in film, including &quot;Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands&quot; in 1976, and having been nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature 7 times. His work reflects the image of a Mestiço Brazil and is marked by religious syncretism. He depicted a cheerful and optimistic country that was beset, at the same time, with deep social and economic differences.

He occupied the 23rd chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters from 1961 until his death in 2001. He won the 1984 International Nonino Prize in Italy. He also was Federal Deputy for São Paulo as a member of the Brazilian Communist Party between 1947 and 1951.

==Biography==
Amado was born on Saturday, 10 August 1912, on a farm near the inland city of Itabuna, in the south of the Brazilian state of Bahia. He was the eldest of four sons of João Amado de Faria and D. Eulália Leal. The farm was located in the village of Ferradas, which, though today is a district of Itabuna, was at the time administered by the coastal city of Ilhéus. For this reason, he considered himself a citizen of Ilhéus. From his exposure to the large cocoa plantations of the area, Amado knew the misery and the struggles of the people working the land and living in almost enslaved conditions. This was to be a theme present in several of his works, for example, &quot;The Violent Land&quot; of 1944.

As a result of a smallpox epidemic, his family moved to Ilhéus when he was one year old, and he spent his childhood there. He attended high school in Salvador, the capital of the state. By the age of 14 Amado had begun to collaborate with several magazines and took part in literary life, as one of the founders of the Modernist &quot;Rebels&#x27; Academy&quot;.

He was the cousin of Brazilian lawyer, writer, journalist and politician , and of Brazilian actress and screenwriter Véra Clouzot.
Amado published his first novel, &quot;The Country of Carnival&quot;, in 1931, aged 18. He married Matilde Garcia Rosa and had a daughter, Lila, in 1933. The same year he published his second novel, &quot;Cacau&quot;, which increased his popularity. 

He studied law at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro Faculty of Law but never became a practising lawyer. His leftist activities made his life difficult under the dictatorial regime of Getúlio Vargas. In 1935 he was arrested for the first time, and two years later his books were publicly burned. His works were banned from Portugal, but in the rest of Europe, he gained great popularity with the publication of &quot;Jubiabá&quot; in France. The book received enthusiastic reviews, including that of Nobel Prize winner French author Albert Camus.

In the early 1940s, Amado edited a literary supplement for the Nazi-funded political newspaper &quot;Meio-Dia&quot;. Being a communist militant, from 1941 to 1942 Amado was compelled to go into exile to Argentina and Uruguay. When he returned to Brazil he separated from Matilde Garcia Rosa. In 1945 he was elected to the National Constituent Assembly, as a representative of the Brazilian Communist Party (PCB) (he received more votes than any other candidate in the state of São Paulo). He signed a law granting freedom of religious faith.

He remarried in 1945, to the writer Zélia Gattai. In 1947 they had a son, João Jorge. The same year his party was declared illegal, and its members arrested and persecuted. Amado chose exile once again, this time in France, where he remained until he was expelled in 1950. 

His daughter from his first marriage, Lila, died in 1949. From 1950 to 1952 Amado and Gattai lived in Czechoslovakia, where another daughter, Paloma, was born. He also travelled to the Soviet Union, winning the Stalin Peace Prize in 1951. Documents released to the public in 2016 show that in this period he was investigated by the CIA.
On his return to Brazil in 1954, Amado abandoned active political life, leaving the Communist Party one year later. From that period on he dedicated himself solely to literature. 

His second creative phase began in 1958 with &quot;Gabriela, Clove and Cinnamon&quot;, which was described by Jean-Paul Sartre as &quot;the best example of a folk novel&quot;. Amado abandoned, in part, the realism and the social themes of his early works, producing a series of novels focusing mainly on feminine characters, devoted to a kind of smiling celebration of the traditions and the beauties of Bahia. In addition to &quot;Gabriela&quot; these novels included &quot;Tereza Batista: Home from the Wars&quot; and &quot;Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands&quot;. 

His depiction of the sexual customs of his land was scandalous to much of 1950s Brazilian society and for several years Amado could not even enter Ilhéus, where &quot;Gabriela&quot; was set, due to threats received for the alleged offence to the morality of the city&#x27;s women. The Soviet Union kept publishing Amado&#x27;s works shortly after their release in Portuguese.

On 6 April 1961, he was elected to the Brazilian Academy of Letters. On his death, his wife was elected to replace him. Amado made the Academy the setting for one of his novels, &quot;Pen, Sword, Camisole&quot;. He received the title of Doctor &quot;honoris causa&quot; from several universities in Brazil, Portugal, Italy, Israel and France, as well as other honours in almost every South American country, including &quot;Obá de Xangô&quot; (santoon) of the Candomblé, the traditional Afro-Brazilian religion of Bahia. 

He was finally removed from the French Government blacklist in 1965 following the intervention of the then Minister of Culture, André Malraux. In 1984 he was awarded the French Légion d’Honneur by President François Mitterrand.

His books have been translated into 49 languages in 55 countries, and adapted into films, theatrical works and TV programmes. They even inspired some samba schools of the Brazilian Carnival. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature seven times: in 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, and 1973.

In 1987, the &quot;House of Jorge Amado Foundation&quot; was created in Salvador. It promotes the protection of Amado&#x27;s estate and the development of culture in Bahia. The recently renovated building on the Pelourinho in Salvador contains a small museum and wall panels with the covers of international editions of Amado&#x27;s books.

===Final years and death===
In his final years, Amado suffered from diabetes. On 5 August 2001, he was admitted to Hospital Aliança in Salvador (Bahia), where he died at the 19:30 BRT of the next day of heart and lung failure, four days before his 89th birthday. His ashes were spread in the garden of his house four days later.

===Legacy===
On 4 December 2014, he received (posthumously) from the Legislative Assembly of Bahia appointment as Commander of Meritorious Citizen of the Freedom and Social Justice João Mangabeira (CBJM), the State&#x27;s highest honour, due to his work in defence of social rights.

On 20 October 2017, a newly-discovered species of frog from Bahia, &quot;Phyllodytes amadoi&quot;, was named in his honor. The discoverers of this species noted that in addition to living in the same area as the species&#x27; type locality, Amado was a lifelong frog enthusiast - over the course of his life, he had acquired a large collection of frog-themed souvenirs from around the world, some of which remain on display at his home in Salvador to this day.

<text>The National Research Council Time Signal was Canada&#x27;s longest running radio program, begun 5 November 1939 until its final broadcast on 9 October 2023. Broadcast daily shortly before 13:00 Eastern Time across the CBC Radio One network, it lasted between 15 and 60 seconds, ending exactly at 13:00. During standard time, the signal was at 13:00 Eastern Standard Time and during Daylight Saving Time, the signal was at 13:00 Eastern Daylight Saving Time.

The signal was also heard on some stations of the Ici Radio-Canada Première network at 12:00 ET daily, particularly in Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime provinces.

The signal consisted of a series of 300 ms &quot;pips&quot; of an sine wave tone, each one starting at the top of each UTC second, up to ten seconds before the hour, followed by silence, and then a one-second-long 800 Hz tone to mark the top of the hour. The CBC time signal was typically delayed by about 300 ms with respect to the CHU time signal, because each CBC radio station received the actual time signal from Ottawa by satellite.

One of the first announcers of what was then the Dominion Observatory Time Signal on CBC was Lorne Greene, while he was a staff announcer at CBO.

The most recent spoken header, as announced by one of CBC Radio&#x27;s promotional voices, was as follows:

In different time zones, the local time and time zone was used instead. This header was usually spoken over the initial pips. As of May 2011, the length of the silence had been reduced to six seconds, with a soft click at the beginning of each second during the silence.

At the top of many other hours, and at the discretion of each station, a one-second tone was sounded, but the hour itself was not necessarily announced.

The segment was discontinued in part due to concerns about accuracy as the CBC&#x27;s feed is distributed over the internet and satellite as well as conventional radio. An NRC spokesperson noted that the CBC&#x27;s installation of HD Radio transmitters led to a delay of up to 9 seconds in transmission. The CBC itself noted that with different distribution methods for CBC radio, it could no longer ensure the time signal&#x27;s accuracy.

==NRC Telephone Talking Clock==
NRC runs two telephone numbers that announce the time of day. Voice announcements of Eastern Time are made every 10 seconds, followed by a tone indicating the exact time. This service is available to the general public by dialing +1 (613) 745-1576 for English service and +1 (613) 745-9426 for French service. The call is automatically cut off after 30 seconds or three announcements. Long-distance charges may apply for those calling from outside the Ottawa/Gatineau area, depending on provider.

The English message, voiced by late CBC Radio announcer Harry Mannis, is in the following format, repeated every ten seconds:

The French service uses the voice of Radio-Canada news anchor Simon Durivage, with the following message format:

This is followed by a single 800 Hz beep lasting 0.3 seconds. The word &quot;exactly&quot; (in French, ) replaces &quot;and &quot;s&quot; seconds&quot;/&quot;&quot; at the top of the minute. Additionally, there is an 800 Hz &quot;tick&quot; every second in the background.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, a modified version of the NRC Telephone Talking Clock was transmitted over television channel CPAC while the House of Commons was not sitting. The announcements alternated between English and French, and cycled through all six of Canada&#x27;s time zones, as well as UTC.

== NRC NTP service ==
The NRC offers time synchronization over the Internet using Network Time Protocol. Computers, routers, and other devices with NTP clients (including Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows) can use these servers to ensure that they have the correct time.

The NTP stratum-2 servers are at these addresses:
* time.nrc.ca
* time.chu.nrc.ca
The NRC NTP service was subject to multiple denial-of-service attacks in 2014, which led to minor disruptions.

<text>Jean de Charpentier or Johann von Charpentier (8 December 1786 – 12 December 1855) was a German-Swiss geologist who studied Swiss glaciers. He was born in Freiberg, Electorate of Saxony, Holy Roman Empire and died in Bex, Switzerland.

==Life==
After following in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a mining engineer he excelled in his field while working in the copper mines in the Pyrénées and salt mines in western Switzerland.

In 1818 a catastrophic event changed his life focus when an ice-dammed lake in the Val de Bagnes above Martigny broke through its barrier, causing many deaths. Afterwards, he made extensive field studies in the Alps. Using evidence of erratic boulders and moraines and drawing on the works of Goethe, he hypothesized that Swiss glaciers had once been much more extensive. These boulders, characteristic of glaciers, were strewn as if they were brought there by glaciers that no longer existed. Even so, he wasn&#x27;t sure how glaciers first formed, moved, or how they disappeared. His ideas were later taken up and developed by Louis Agassiz.
==Legacy==
The glacier of Charpentierbreen in Nathorst Land at Spitsbergen, Svalbard is named after him.

<doc id="421325" wikidata="Q2905420" url="?curid=421325" title="Black Mountain poets">
<text>The Black Mountain poets, also called projectivist poets, were a group of mid-20th-century American &quot;avant-garde&quot; or postmodern poets based at Black Mountain College in North Carolina.

==Historical background and definition==

Although it lasted only twenty-three years (1933–1956) and enrolled fewer than 1,200 students, Black Mountain College was one of the most fabled experimental institutions in art education and practice. It launched a remarkable number of the artists who spearheaded the avant-garde in the America of the 1960s. It boasted an extraordinary curriculum in the visual, literary, and performing arts.

The literary movement traditionally described as the &quot;Black Mountain Poets&quot; centered around Charles Olson, who became a teacher at the college in 1948. Robert Creeley, who worked as a teacher and editor of the &quot; Black Mountain Review&quot; for two years, is considered to be another major figure. Creeley moved to San Francisco in 1957. There, he acted as a link between the Black Mountain poets and the Beats, many of whom he had published in the review. Members of the Black Mountain Poets include students and teachers at Black Mountain, together with their friends and correspondents.

The term was first coined by Donald Allen in his anthology &quot;The New American Poetry 1945–1960&quot; (which divides the poets included in its pages into various &quot;schools&quot;). He included Olson, Creeley, Ed Dorn, Robert Duncan, Denise Levertov, Larry Eigner, Joel Oppenheimer, Jonathan Williams, Paul Blackburn, and Paul Carroll in its members. Allen&#x27;s definition of the Black Mountain poets proved to be crucial: it established a legacy and promoted their literary influence worldwide.

However, the exact definition of the group is considered disputable. Olson described the term as &quot;bullshit&quot; and stated that they never considered themselves a particular &quot;clique&quot; or had a particular form of poetics. Other principal figures often included in the Black Mountain poets include John Wieners, M. C. Richards, Hilda Morley, Francine du Plessix Gray, Fielding Dawson, Paul Goodman, and Arthur Penn.

== Poetics ==
The Black Mountain poets were largely free of literary convention, a feature which defined contemporary American poets. Their work became characterized by open form. Olson&#x27;s pedagogical approach to poetry emphasized the importance of personal experience and direct observation, something which greatly influenced the Black Mountain poets. Many of the Black Mountain poets, including Levertov, Duncan, and Dorn, explored individual agency&#x27;s potential to affect collective change through their political poetry.

=== Projective verse ===
In 1950, Charles Olson published his seminal essay, &quot;Projective Verse&quot;. In this, he called for a poetry of &quot;open field&quot; composition to replace traditional closed poetic forms with an improvised form that should reflect exactly the content of the poem. This form was to be based on the line, and each line was to be a unit of breath and of utterance. Olson felt that English poetry had become restricted by meter, syntax and rhyme instead of embracing the more natural constraints of breath and syllables which he felt would define true American poetics. The content was to consist of &quot;one perception immediately and directly (leading) to a further perception&quot;. This essay was to become a kind of &quot;de facto&quot; manifesto for the Black Mountain poets. One of the effects of narrowing the unit of structure in the poem down to what could fit within an utterance was that the Black Mountain poets developed a distinctive style of poetic diction (e.g. &quot;yr&quot; for &quot;your&quot;).

==Legacy==
Apart from their strong interconnections with the Beats, the Black Mountain poets influenced the course of later American poetry via their importance for the poets later identified with the Language School. They were also important for the development of the innovative British Poetry Revival of the 1960s, as evidenced by such poets as Tom Raworth and J. H. Prynne. In Canada, the Vancouver-based &quot;TISH&quot; group, including George Bowering and Daphne Marlatt, were heavily influenced by the Black Mountain poets. Modern projectivist poets include Charles Potts.

<text>Physical Review Focus was an internet service of the American Physical Society that began in 1998, aiming to explain new developments in physics in a language understandable to the educated non-physicist. One or two short articles were published weekly. In 2011, it merged with the magazine &quot;Physics&quot; (physics.aps.org) and became the Focus section of that publication. The Focus section of Physics continues to produce the same style of articles that were previously published in Physical Review Focus.

The content is available without payment.

The name came from the service&#x27;s connection to the &quot;Physical Review&quot;, a suite of scientific journals published by the American Physical Society.

<text>The Roundup was a weekday afternoon program on the Radio One network of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation from 1997 to 2005. Heard weekdays from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m. (2:30 to 4:30 in Newfoundland), the show mixed music with calls and letters from listeners which were often comic in nature, feature interviews, and content previously produced and aired by other radio programs, initially other CBC programs but later including content from other radio networks around the world.

The show was originally hosted by Bill Richardson and called Richardson&#x27;s Roundup. It was created in 1997 to replace Vicki Gabereau&#x27;s afternoon show after she left to do a television show with CTV, and premiered on September 1, 1997 from the studios of CBU in Vancouver.

The show also occasionally aired scripted radio dramas. &quot;Test Drive&quot;, a six-episode drama aired in 2001, starred Gordon Pinsent as Earl Hughes, the owner of an independent AMC dealership whose test drives of vehicles with potential customers inevitably devolved into comedic chaos, while a 2002 drama, Paul Ciufo&#x27;s &quot;On Convoy&quot;, centred on servicemen in the Canadian Merchant Navy and aired as part of a special slate of Remembrance Day programming.

Richardson left in 2004 to launch the new weekend series &quot;Bunny Watson&quot;, and Tetsuro Shigematsu, an occasional guest host, became the new permanent host of &quot;The Roundup&quot;.

In 2005, the show was cancelled and replaced with &quot;Freestyle&quot;.

==Sad Goat==
The show&#x27;s phone number for song requests and listener commentaries (723 4628) was to be 1 888 RADIO2U, but when they realised how cumbersome that would be to explain, they looked for alternative spellings. Richardson discovered that the number spelled out the phrase &quot;sad goat&quot;, and 1-888-SAD-GOAT was born. A goat named Sadie became the symbol for the show and the concept was elaborated on from then on.

In 2003 Richardson published the book &quot;Dear Sad Goat&quot;, a compilation of listener stories submitted to the program.

==Critical response==

In 1999, columnist Paula Simons wrote that &quot;Bill Richardson deserves every credit for patching together a program to replace [Gabereau], armed with little but chewing gum, bailing wire, and his own ingenuity. Richardson&#x27;s Roundup is a pastiche of reruns and previews, woven together by the gossamer strands of Richardson&#x27;s considerable charm. It&#x27;s a clever conjuring trick, a recycled remix of snippets, sound bites and segues that fills two hours so pleasantly, you hardly realize how empty it all is. Gabereau&#x27;s provocative, irreverent interviews made us laugh and think and argue. The Roundup&#x27;s low-budget fluff is as irrelevant and ephemeral as dandelion down.&quot;

<text>Johnny Wakelin (born 1939) is an English recording artist best known for songs like &quot;Black Superman&quot; and &quot;In Zaire&quot;, both celebrating boxer Muhammad Ali.

==Career==
Wakelin had his first outings in clubs in his hometown but without big success. Discovered by Pye record producer Robin Blanchflower, the man who launched Carl Douglas to the top of the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Kung Fu Fighting&quot;, and working with Steve Elson and Keith Rossiter in addition to Blanchflower, Wakelin set about writing songs that would, he hoped, &quot;catch people&#x27;s eye&quot;

===&quot;Black Superman (Muhammad Ali)&quot;===
Wakelin wrote a tribute to the boxing champion Muhammad Ali who fought on 30 October 1974 in Kinshasa, Zaire, against George Foreman in a matchup known as The Rumble in the Jungle. Ali gained victory in the eighth round. Wakelin used a reggae style at a time when West Indian music was growing in popularity. The new song was Wakelin&#x27;s &quot;Black Superman (Muhammad Ali)&quot; released in late 1974.

In January 1975 the song reached number seven on the singles charts of both the UK and Australia.
By October of the same year, it had reached number one in Canada on the &quot;RPM&quot; Singles Chart. It also spent six months in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in more than one chart run in 1975, eventually peaking at No. 21 in September of that year.

Muhammad Ali, who disliked being made fun of, shunned the song.

===Later songs===
1975 brought a further single, &quot;Cream Puff,&quot; backed by &quot;Gotta Keep on Going&quot;; it flopped, but both songs would be incorporated into Wakelin&#x27;s March 1976 album, &quot;Reggae, Soul &amp; Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;.

A bigger success was &quot;In Zaire&quot;, also about the 1974 fight, which reached the charts in many parts of Europe in 1976.

After few further releases (&quot;Africa Man&quot;, &quot;You Turn Me On&quot;, &quot;Dr. Frankenstein&#x27;s Disco Party&quot;) his success cooled down. He re-recorded his hit &quot;In Zaire&quot; in different versions which had a little success. He stayed active as a songwriter, and continued to release albums.

Wakelin sang &quot;Where Seagulls Fly&quot;, the Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C. anthem released for their appearance in the 1983 FA Cup Final.

<text>KBS-3 (an abbreviation of &quot;kärnbränslesäkerhet&quot;, nuclear fuel safety) is a technology for disposal of high-level radioactive waste developed in Sweden by Svensk Kärnbränslehantering AB (SKB) by appointment from Statens Strålskyddsinstitut (the government&#x27;s radiation protection agency). The technology was developed by studying different natural storage facilities such as the natural reactor in Oklo, Gabon and the uranium mine in Cigar Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada. The general theory is that radioactive rock in these sites has been present for thousands of years, and has not affected the health and well-being of human populations. KBS-3 is also to be used in Finland at the Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository, being built by Posiva.

The disposal method consists of the following steps:

* The waste is first stored in intermediate storage for 30 years.
* The waste is encapsulated in cast iron canisters. 
* The cast iron canisters are encapsulated in copper (CuOFP alloy) capsules.
* The capsules are deposited in a layer of bentonite clay, in a circular hole, eight meters deep and with a diameter of two meters, drilled in a tunnel 500 metres down into crystalline rock.
* After the storage facility is full, the drill hole is sealed and the site marked.

If the holes into the rock from the tunnel are drilled vertically, the method is called KBS-3V and if they are drilled horizontally it is called KBS-3H. The only method considered so far is KBS-3V.

The overall theory is that radioactive rock has always been present in the earth, and it is generally harmless to human populations. Further, Cigar Lake and Oklo have proven that actinides do not easily migrate via ground water or other means. Spent fuel consists of radioactive ceramic, cooled until its short-half-life radioactives have decayed, so its heat-production is negligible. When initially made, the ceramic fuel is also wrapped in sealed tubes of corrosion-resistant zirconium alloy. Therefore, spent fuel is not water-soluble in any conventional sense, and is mechanically sturdy. The other elements present (crystalline bedrock, corrosion-resistant copper cylinders, etc.) have been scientifically proven to reduce the exposure to ground water, and the rate at which it can penetrate to the fuel and dissolve it. Further, if correctly sited, any leakage will enter seawater, providing a safe dilution until decay. Geological stability against earthquakes and other extreme events can be further increased by careful site-selection. These safety factors multiply, extending the containment lifetime until most radioactive elements in the fuel have decayed, and only the longest-lived, least-radioactive isotopes remain. At this point, the contents of the repository are at least as safe as natural deposits of uranium. The process has been extensively studied and depends on well-understood chemistry and geology.

The risk of waste disposal is difficult to measure due to the necessity of gathering data over thousands of years. However, by employing process knowledge and risk management methodology, the risk associated with KBS-3 repositories have been thoroughly investigated in the assessments of long-term safety performed by SKB and Posiva.

== Facilities ==

The first facilities using this method will be located in Östhammar, Sweden, next to the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant, and in Eurajoki, Finland, at the Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository next to the Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant. In 2019, Posiva Ltd. announced that the construction of the spent nuclear fuel handling facility for Onkalo and installation of the requisite equipment in the Onkalo tunnels will begin. The contract was awarded to Skanska, and the expected date of completion will be in summer 2022. The operation of the facility will begin in the 2020s.

The Östhammar facility will have space for 6,000 capsules and the plan is to deposit 200 capsules into storage annually.

== Criticism ==

In 2012, a research group at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, published research that suggests that the copper capsules of KBS-3 are not as corrosion-proof as SKB and Posiva claim.

In response, STUK (the Finnish nuclear safety office) asked Posiva for further explanation. Posiva dismissed the independent research in Sweden and Finland, referring to its own safety studies. SKB undertook follow-up studies, which indicated that the corrosion process does not exist, and that the initial experiments were not correctly executed and/or the wrong conclusions were drawn.

<doc id="421341" wikidata="Q165638" url="?curid=421341" title="Ratio test">
<text>In mathematics, the ratio test is a test (or &quot;criterion&quot;) for the convergence of a series

:formula_1

where each term is a real or complex number and is nonzero when is large. The test was first published by Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert and is sometimes known as d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s ratio testor as the Cauchy ratio test.

== The test ==

The usual form of the test makes use of the limit
{a_n}\right|.&lt;/math&gt;|}}
The ratio test states that:
* if &quot;L&quot; &lt; 1 then the series converges absolutely; 
* if &quot;L&quot; &gt; 1 then the series diverges;
* if &quot;L&quot; = 1 or the limit fails to exist, then the test is inconclusive, because there exist both convergent and divergent series that satisfy this case.

It is possible to make the ratio test applicable to certain cases where the limit &quot;L&quot; fails to exist, if limit superior and limit inferior are used. The test criteria can also be refined so that the test is sometimes conclusive even when &quot;L&quot; = 1. More specifically, let

:formula_2
:formula_3.

Then the ratio test states that:
* if &quot;R&quot; &lt; 1, the series converges absolutely;
* if &quot;r&quot; &gt; 1, the series diverges; or equivalently if formula_4 for all large &quot;n&quot; (regardless of the value of &quot;r&quot;), the series also diverges; this is because formula_5 is nonzero and increasing and hence does not approach zero;
* the test is otherwise inconclusive.

If the limit &quot;L&quot; in () exists, we must have &quot;L&quot; = &quot;R&quot; = &quot;r&quot;. So the original ratio test is a weaker version of the refined one.

== Examples ==
=== Convergent because &quot;L&quot; &lt; 1 ===
Consider the series

:formula_6

Applying the ratio test, one computes the limit

:formula_7

Since this limit is less than 1, the series converges.

=== Divergent because &quot;L&quot; &gt; 1 ===
Consider the series

:formula_8

Putting this into the ratio test:

:formula_9

Thus the series diverges.

=== Inconclusive because &quot;L&quot; = 1 ===
Consider the three series

:formula_10
:formula_11
:formula_12

The first series (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ⋯) diverges, the second (the one central to the Basel problem) converges absolutely and the third (the alternating harmonic series) converges conditionally. However, the term-by-term magnitude ratios formula_13 of the three series are formula_14   formula_15    and   formula_16. So, in all three, the limit formula_17 is equal to 1. This illustrates that when &quot;L&quot; = 1, the series may converge or diverge: the ratio test is inconclusive. In such cases, more refined tests are required to determine convergence or divergence.

== Proof ==

Below is a proof of the validity of the generalized ratio test.

Suppose that formula_18. We also suppose that formula_19 has infinite non-zero members, otherwise the series is just a finite sum hence it converges. Then there exists some formula_20 such that there exists a natural number formula_21 satisfying formula_22 and formula_23 for all formula_24, because if no such formula_25 exists then there exists arbitrarily large formula_26 satisfying formula_27 for every formula_20, then we can find a subsequence formula_29 satisfying formula_30, but this contradicts the fact that formula_31 is the limit inferior of formula_13 as formula_33, implying the existence of formula_25. Then we notice that for formula_35, formula_36. Notice that formula_37 so formula_38 as formula_33 and formula_40, this implies formula_19 diverges so the series formula_42 diverges by the n-th term test.&lt;br&gt;
Now suppose formula_43. Similar to the above case, we may find a natural number formula_44 and a formula_45 such that formula_46 for formula_47. Then
formula_48
The series formula_49 is the geometric series with common ratio formula_50, hence formula_51 which is finite. The sum formula_52 is a finite sum and hence it is bounded, this implies the series formula_53 converges by the monotone convergence theorem and the series formula_42 converges by the absolute convergence test.&lt;br&gt;
When the limit formula_13 exists and equals to formula_56 then formula_57, this gives the original ratio test.

== Extensions for &quot;L&quot; = 1 ==

As seen in the previous example, the ratio test may be inconclusive when the limit of the ratio is 1. Extensions to the ratio test, however, sometimes allow one to deal with this case.

In all the tests below one assumes that Σ&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; is a sum with positive &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;. These tests also may be applied to any series with a finite number of negative terms. Any such series may be written as:

:formula_58

where &quot;aN&quot; is the highest-indexed negative term. The first expression on the right is a partial sum which will be finite, and so the convergence of the entire series will be determined by the convergence properties of the second expression on the right, which may be re-indexed to form a series of all positive terms beginning at &quot;n&quot;=1.

Each test defines a test parameter (ρn) which specifies the behavior of that parameter needed to establish convergence or divergence. For each test, a weaker form of the test exists which will instead place restrictions upon limn-&gt;∞ρn.

All of the tests have regions in which they fail to describe the convergence properties of Σan. In fact, no convergence test can fully describe the convergence properties of the series. This is because if Σan is convergent, a second convergent series Σbn can be found which converges more slowly: i.e., it has the property that limn-&gt;∞ (bn/an) = ∞. Furthermore, if Σan is divergent, a second divergent series Σbn can be found which diverges more slowly: i.e., it has the property that limn-&gt;∞ (bn/an) = 0. Convergence tests essentially use the comparison test on some particular family of an, and fail for sequences which converge or diverge more slowly.

=== De Morgan hierarchy ===

Augustus De Morgan proposed a hierarchy of ratio-type tests

The ratio test parameters (formula_59) below all generally involve terms of the form formula_60. This term may be multiplied by formula_61 to yield formula_62. This term can replace the former term in the definition of the test parameters and the conclusions drawn will remain the same. Accordingly, there will be no distinction drawn between references which use one or the other form of the test parameter.

====1. d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s ratio test====

The first test in the De Morgan hierarchy is the ratio test as described above.

====2. Raabe&#x27;s test====

This extension is due to Joseph Ludwig Raabe. Define:

:formula_63

(and some extra terms, see Ali, Blackburn, Feld, Duris (none), Duris2)

The series will:
* Converge when there exists a &quot;c&gt;&quot;1 such that formula_64 for all &quot;n&gt;N&quot;.
* Diverge when formula_65 for all &quot;n&gt;N&quot;.
* Otherwise, the test is inconclusive.

For the limit version, the series will:
* Converge if formula_66 (this includes the case &quot;ρ&quot; = ∞)
* Diverge if formula_67.
* If &quot;ρ&quot; = 1, the test is inconclusive.

When the above limit does not exist, it may be possible to use limits superior and inferior. The series will:
* Converge if formula_68
* Diverge if formula_69
* Otherwise, the test is inconclusive.

=====Proof of Raabe&#x27;s test=====

Defining formula_63, we need not assume the limit exists; if formula_71, then formula_72 diverges, while if formula_73 the sum converges.

The proof proceeds essentially by comparison with formula_74. Suppose first that formula_71. Of course
if formula_76 then formula_77 for large formula_26, so the sum diverges; assume then that formula_79. There exists formula_80 such that formula_81 for all formula_82, which is to say that formula_83. Thus formula_84, which implies that
formula_85 for formula_82; since formula_80 this shows that formula_72 diverges.

The proof of the other half is entirely analogous, with most of the inequalities simply reversed. We need a preliminary inequality to use
in place of the simple formula_89 that was used above: Fix formula_90 and formula_91. Note that
formula_92. So formula_93; hence formula_94.

Suppose now that formula_95. Arguing as in the first paragraph, using the inequality established in the previous paragraph, we see that there exists formula_96 such that formula_97 for formula_82; since formula_96 this shows that formula_72 converges.

==== 3. Bertrand&#x27;s test ====

This extension is due to Joseph Bertrand and Augustus De Morgan.

Defining:

:formula_101

Bertrand&#x27;s test asserts that the series will:
* Converge when there exists a &quot;c&gt;1&quot; such that formula_64 for all &quot;n&gt;N&quot;.
* Diverge when formula_65 for all &quot;n&gt;N&quot;.
* Otherwise, the test is inconclusive.

For the limit version, the series will:
* Converge if formula_66 (this includes the case &quot;ρ&quot; = ∞)
* Diverge if formula_67.
* If &quot;ρ&quot; = 1, the test is inconclusive.

When the above limit does not exist, it may be possible to use limits superior and inferior. The series will:
* Converge if formula_106
* Diverge if formula_107
* Otherwise, the test is inconclusive.

==== 4. Extended Bertrand&#x27;s test ====

This extension probably appeared at the first time by Margaret Martin in 1941. A short proof based on Kummer&#x27;s test and without technical assumptions (such as existence of the limits, for example) was provided by Vyacheslav Abramov in 2019.

Let formula_108 be an integer, and let formula_109 denote the formula_110th iterate of natural logarithm, i.e. formula_111 and for any formula_112, 
formula_113.

Suppose that the ratio formula_114, when formula_26 is large, can be presented in the form

:formula_116
(The empty sum is assumed to be 0. With formula_117, the test reduces to Bertrand&#x27;s test.)

The value formula_118 can be presented explicitly in the form
:formula_119

Extended Bertrand&#x27;s test asserts that the series
* Converge when there exists a formula_120 such that formula_121 for all formula_122.
* Diverge when formula_123 for all formula_122.
* Otherwise, the test is inconclusive.

For the limit version, the series 
* Converge if formula_66 (this includes the case formula_126)
* Diverge if formula_67.
* If formula_128, the test is inconclusive.

When the above limit does not exist, it may be possible to use limits superior and inferior. The series 
* Converge if formula_106
* Diverge if formula_107
* Otherwise, the test is inconclusive.

For applications of Extended Bertrand&#x27;s test see birth–death process.

==== 5. Gauss&#x27;s test ====

This extension is due to Carl Friedrich Gauss.

Assuming &quot;an&quot; &gt; 0 and &quot;r &gt; 1&quot;, if a bounded sequence &quot;Cn&quot; can be found such that for all &quot;n&quot;:

:formula_131

then the series will:
* Converge if formula_132
* Diverge if formula_133

==== 6. Kummer&#x27;s test ====

This extension is due to Ernst Kummer.

Let ζ&quot;n&quot; be an auxiliary sequence of positive constants. Define

:formula_134

Kummer&#x27;s test states that the series will:
* Converge if there exists a formula_135 such that formula_64 for all n&gt;N. (Note this is not the same as saying formula_137)
* Diverge if formula_138 for all n&gt;N and formula_139 diverges.

For the limit version, the series will:
* Converge if formula_140 (this includes the case &quot;ρ&quot; = ∞)
* Diverge if formula_141 and formula_139 diverges.
* Otherwise the test is inconclusive

When the above limit does not exist, it may be possible to use limits superior and inferior. The series will
* Converge if formula_143
* Diverge if formula_144 and formula_145 diverges.

===== Special cases =====

All of the tests in De Morgan&#x27;s hierarchy except Gauss&#x27;s test can easily be seen as special cases of Kummer&#x27;s test:
* For the ratio test, let ζn=1. Then:
::formula_146
* For Raabe&#x27;s test, let ζn=n. Then:
::formula_147
* For Bertrand&#x27;s test, let ζn=n ln(n). Then:
::formula_148
:Using formula_149 and approximating formula_150 for large &quot;n&quot;, which is negligible compared to the other terms, formula_151 may be written:
::formula_152
* For Extended Bertrand&#x27;s test, let formula_153 From the Taylor series expansion for large formula_26 we arrive at the approximation 
::formula_155
where the empty product is assumed to be 1. Then,
::formula_156

Hence,

::formula_157

Note that for these four tests, the higher they are in the De Morgan hierarchy, the more slowly the formula_158 series diverges.

=====Proof of Kummer&#x27;s test=====

If formula_159 then fix a positive number formula_160. There exists
a natural number formula_91 such that for every formula_162
:formula_163
Since formula_164, for every formula_165
:formula_166
In particular formula_167 for all formula_168 which means that starting from the index
formula_91
the sequence formula_170 is monotonically decreasing and
positive which in particular implies that it is bounded below by 0. Therefore, the limit
:formula_171 exists.
This implies that the positive telescoping series
:formula_172 is convergent,
and since for all formula_162
:formula_174
by the direct comparison test for positive series, the series
formula_175 is convergent.

On the other hand, if formula_176, then there is an &quot;N&quot; such that formula_177 is increasing for formula_122. In particular, there exists an formula_179 for which formula_180 for all formula_122, and so formula_182 diverges by comparison with formula_183.

=== Tong&#x27;s modification of Kummer&#x27;s test===

A new version of Kummer&#x27;s test was established by Tong. See also 
for further discussions and new proofs. The provided modification of Kummer&#x27;s theorem characterizes
all positive series, and the convergence or divergence can be formulated in the form of two necessary and sufficient conditions, one for convergence and another for divergence.

* Series formula_42 converges if and only if there exists a positive sequence formula_185, formula_186, such that formula_187

* Series formula_42 diverges if and only if there exists a positive sequence formula_185, formula_186, such that formula_191 and formula_192

The first of these statements can be simplified as follows:

* Series formula_42 converges if and only if there exists a positive sequence formula_185, formula_186, such that formula_196

The second statement can be simplified similarly:
* Series formula_42 diverges if and only if there exists a positive sequence formula_185, formula_186, such that formula_200 and formula_192

However, it becomes useless, since the condition formula_202 in this case reduces to the original claim formula_203

=== Frink&#x27;s ratio test ===
Another ratio test that can be set in the framework of Kummer&#x27;s theorem was presented by Orrin Frink 1948.

Suppose formula_204 is a sequence in formula_205,
* If formula_206, then the series formula_207 converges absolutely.
* If there is formula_208 such that formula_209 for all formula_168, then formula_211 diverges.

This result reduces to a comparison of formula_211 with a power series formula_213, and can be seen to be related to Raabe&#x27;s test.

=== Ali&#x27;s second ratio test ===
A more refined ratio test is the second ratio test:
For formula_214 define:
By the second ratio test, the series will:
* Converge if formula_215
* Diverge if formula_216
* If formula_217 then the test is inconclusive.

If the above limits do not exist, it may be possible to use the limits superior and inferior. Define:

Then the series will:
* Converge if formula_215
* Diverge if formula_219
* If formula_220 then the test is inconclusive.

=== Ali&#x27;s &quot;m&quot;th ratio test ===

This test is a direct extension of the second ratio test. For formula_221 and positive formula_204 define:

By the formula_223th ratio test, the series will:
* Converge if formula_224
* Diverge if formula_225
* If formula_226 then the test is inconclusive.

If the above limits do not exist, it may be possible to use the limits superior and inferior. For formula_227 define:

Then the series will:
* Converge if formula_224
* Diverge if formula_229
* If formula_230, then the test is inconclusive.

=== Ali--Deutsche Cohen φ-ratio test ===

This test is an extension of the formula_223th ratio test.

Assume that the sequence formula_204 is a positive decreasing sequence.

Let formula_233 be such that formula_234 exists. Denote formula_235, and assume formula_236.

Assume also that formula_237

Then the series will:

* Converge if formula_238
* Diverge if formula_239
* If formula_240, then the test is inconclusive.

<text>Global Village was an Australian television show broadcast by the Australian public broadcaster SBS. The program was hosted by Silvio Rivier, who also did many of the voice overs. In 2008 it combined with &quot;Thalassa&quot;, a French documentary series, to expand its coverage of coastal areas.

&quot;Global Village&quot; covered communities from all over the globe. The show consisted of usually two, mostly short films 10–15 minutes long describing land and people all across the world. About 50% come from a French TV station and thus deal with topics from France, or, less frequently, its former colonies.

The main focus is to educate viewers about different cultures and working styles from around the world. Global Village has released two music CDs which contain a selection of music taken from the countries they visit.

==Timeslot==
2007: 18:00–18:30
2008: 18:00–18:30 (Monday&#x27;s showing is about cuisine and cooking)

==Cancellation==
At the end of the episode on Friday 30 January 2015 Silvio Rivier announced that it had been the final episode and that the series was finishing. He noted that the series had been in production for just over 16 years, since late 1998, and that it was the longest-running in-house SBS program.

<doc id="421351" wikidata="Q5450429" url="?curid=421351" title="Finkleman's 45s">
<text>Finkleman&#x27;s 45s was a Canadian radio show, which aired Saturday evenings from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. (half an hour later in Newfoundland) on CBC Radio One starting on October 5, 1985 and running until June 25, 2005. In the show Danny Finkleman played popular songs from the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, and talked about anything he felt like. For example, a regular component of the show was his advocation of a new business idea of his that he had observed a need for. Finkleman provided over 1,000 of his own unique business product and service ideas that he would rationalise and encourage listeners to adopt and develop as their own. Also, from 1985 to 1994, a regular guest on his show was musician and music expert Jack Schechtman. Danny called him, &quot;The Dean of the Obscure&quot;. He and Danny would engage in friendly banter about the state of the Music Business (see below) with Jack defending the quality of music writing &quot;Post Beatles and Motown&quot;. He would also play obscure songs
from his personal 45&#x27;s collection, from Doo Wop to Singer Songwriters, for Danny to either praise or pan.

The show was noted for Finkleman&#x27;s rants about the modern world, including topics such as modern music and computers. Finkleman was generally opposed to both. In general the show was quite informal. The show&#x27;s playlist was noted for its fairly wide selection of music from the period. Danny often played less popular songs than commercial &quot;oldies&quot; shows were able to. Favourite groups included the Shirelles, the Diamonds, Patti LaBelle, the Four Preps, the Box Tops, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, Georgie Fame and the True Blues, The Crew-Cuts, Paul Anka, Otis Redding and Dusty Springfield.

Finkleman disliked the Rolling Stones and partly blamed them for the decline of music in the 1970s. One of Finkleman&#x27;s central ideas was that the politicization of music in the mid-1970s ruined music, making it &quot;mean spirited&quot;, &quot;pretentious&quot; and &quot;ugly&quot;. According to Finkleman, the show&#x27;s title was loosely based on the name of &quot;Gilmour&#x27;s Albums&quot;, a popular variety show on CBC at the time Finkleman&#x27;s show was conceived.

Finkleman retired from CBC radio in June, 2005 and the show ended with him. Since 1993 Finkleman had worked only part-time at the CBC; he was also a stockbroker at Desjardins Securities in Toronto.

Randy Bachman&#x27;s &quot;Vinyl Tap&quot; was the successor show in this timeslot.

<text>USS &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; (ACV/CVE-56) was the second of fifty s built to serve the United States Navy during World War II. Launched in April 1943 and commissioned the following August, she was named for Liscome Bay in Dall Island in the Alexander Archipelago of Alaska. On 24 November 1943, her munitions were catastrophically detonated by a torpedo attack by the while she was acting as the flagship of Carrier Division 24, which was supporting operations on Makin. She quickly sank with the loss of 702 officers and sailors. Her loss is the deadliest sinking of a carrier in the history of the United States Navy.

==Design and description==

&quot;Liscome Bay&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered by two Uniflow reciprocating steam engines which drove two shafts, providing and enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. For example, during her only combat deployment, Operation Kourbash, she carried 11 FM-1 and five F4F-4 fighters, as well as nine TBM-1 and three TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 28 aircraft.

==Construction==
She was laid down on 12 December 1942, under a Maritime Commission contract, MCE hull 1137, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was launched on 19 April 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Clara Klinksick, wife of Rear Admiral Ben Moreell, the Chief of the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Yards and Docks. Originally, she was intended to be sent to the British Royal Navy under the name HMS &quot;Ameer&quot;. However, a change in plans resulted in the USS &quot;Baffins&quot; being redesignated as &quot;Ameer&quot; in &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;″s place. She was named &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; on 28 June 1943, as part of tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. The vessel was assigned the hull classification symbol CVE-56 on 15 July 1943, and was commissioned on 7 August 1943. Captain Irving D. Wiltsie was the ship&#x27;s first commander, and her crew was derived from the &quot;Bogue&quot;-class escort carrier USS &quot;Glacier&quot;, which had been ordered in July 1942 but was sent to the Royal Navy as part of the Lend-Lease program.

==Service history==
After being commissioned, &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; proceeded southwards towards San Diego, California, picking up and ferrying 60 aircraft from San Francisco on the way, arriving on 22 September 1943. For the next month, she engaged in training operations off the Southern California coast. On 11 October, she was designated as the flagship of Carrier Division 24, under the command of Rear Admiral Henry M. Mullinnix. On 14 October, she received her aircraft contingent, and on 21 October, she departed for Pearl Harbor, arriving a week later, on 27 October. She then conducted additional drills and training exercises off of Hawaii until early November, when she was assigned to the invasion fleet assembling for Operation Kourbash. As a member of Carrier Division 24, she departed from Pearl Harbor on 10 November as part of Task Force 52 commanded by Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner, bound for the invasion of the Gilbert Islands. It was to be her first and last mission.

&quot;Liscome Bay&quot; was assigned to the naval forces supporting the invasion of Makin. The invasion bombardment announcing the first major U.S. naval thrust into the central Pacific began on 20 November at 5 a.m. Just 76 hours later, Tarawa and Makin Islands were both captured. &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;″s aircraft had played a vital role in the capture of Makin, providing close air support and bombing Japanese positions. In total, 2,278 sorties were conducted by the carrier task group in support of Operation Galvanic, which neutralized enemy airbases, supported U.S. Army landings and ground operations with bombing and strafing missions, and intercepted enemy aircraft. With the islands secured, U.S. naval forces began retiring. However, &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; stayed with the rest of her task force as Marines mopped up resistance on Butaritari Island.

===Sinking===
The invasion of the Gilbert Islands had caught the Japanese command by surprise. Admiral Mineichi Koga, in desperation, issued orders to recall four Japanese submarines southwest of Hawaii and five submarines near Truk and Rabaul to converge on the Gilberts. Of the nine Japanese submarines sent to sortie against the U.S. forces in the Gilberts, six were lost.

On 23 November, however, the submarine , commanded by Lieutenant Commander Sunao Tabata, arrived off Makin. The U.S. task group, built around Rear Admiral Henry M. Mullinnix&#x27;s three escort carriers, was steaming southwest of Butaritari Island at 15 knots. The task group was traveling in a circular formation, with seven destroyers, the cruiser , the battleships , , and , and &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;″s two sister ships, and , surrounding her. &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;, as the guide for the group, was located dead center between the other ships. As collisions were deemed to be a greater risk to the ships than a potential submarine attack, the ships were not zig-zagging.

At 04:30 on 24 November, reveille was sounded in &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;. On 04:34, the destroyer left to investigate a signal beacon, likely dropped from a Japanese plane. This resulted in a gap within &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;″s screen. At 04:36, the radar operators on &quot;New Mexico&quot; spotted a short-lived blip, which may have represented &quot;I-175&quot; diving into position. Flight quarters was sounded at 04:50. The crew went to routine general quarters at 05:05, when flight crews prepared their planes for dawn launching. Thirteen planes, including one forward on the catapult, had been readied on the flight deck. These had all been fueled and armed. There were an additional seven planes in the hangar that were not fueled or armed. She had a large amount of munitions on board, stored below-decks. Meanwhile, the task group executed a turn to the northeast, which brought &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; to a course presenting her side to &quot;I-175&quot;. The Japanese submarine fired a spread of at least three Type 95 torpedoes towards the task force.

At about 05:10, a lookout on the starboard (right) side of &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; reported seeing a torpedo headed for the ship. The torpedo struck behind the aft engine room, as &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; was conducting its turn, and detonated the bomb magazine, causing a devastating explosion that engulfed the ship and sent shrapnel flying as far as away. Considerable debris fell on the battleship &quot;New Mexico&quot; about off, while a sailor on board the escort carrier &quot;Coral Sea&quot; was reportedly hit by a fire extinguisher from &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;. The entire task force was rocked by the explosion, but no other ships were significantly damaged. A mushroom cloud erupted, rising thousands of feet above the wreck of &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;.

The detonation sheared off nearly the entire stern of the carrier, killing everyone behind the forward bulkhead of the aft engine room. Seawater quickly rushed into the gap, mixing with oil released from the hull. Both the hangar and flight decks were heavily damaged. Parts of the superstructure, including the radar antenna, collapsed onto the deck. The forward part of the hangar was immediately engulfed in flames, igniting the few remaining planes on the flight deck. Planes fell off the carrier&#x27;s deck. Steam, compressed air, and fire-main pressure were lost throughout the ship. Fires on the flight deck caused ammunition within the burning aircraft and anti-aircraft guns to detonate, further complicating matters. The gasoline coated water surrounding &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; caught fire, hampering efforts by survivors to escape.

At 05:33, only 23 minutes after the explosion, &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; listed to starboard and sank; 54 officers and 648 sailors were killed, including Captain Irving Wiltsie, Rear Admiral Henry M. Mullinnix and Doris Miller. 12 Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bombers, 7 Grumman FM-1 Wildcat fighters, and 4 Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters went down with &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;.

===Rescue===
When &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; detonated, the rest of the task group immediately conducted evasive maneuvers, scattering from her wreck. At 05:40, the destroyers , and arrived at the oil slick to rescue survivors, but many of the sailors hauled up were dead or dying. At 06:10, the destroyer spotted two torpedo wakes, one just from the destroyer&#x27;s hull. A radar operator on &quot;New Mexico&quot; detected an echo, and &quot;Hull&quot; was recalled to join in dropping depth charges. took &quot;Hull&quot;″s place in picking up survivors. At 08:00, the search operation was concluded. Of the 916 crewmen aboard &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;, 644, including Wiltsie, Mullinnix, and Miller (Cook 3rd Class Doris Miller, see &quot;Notable crew&quot; below), went down with the ship, whilst 272 survived. Many of the survivors died of wounds soon afterwards for a total of 702 killed from &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;. Including those lost on &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;, U.S. casualties in the assault on Makin Island exceeded the strength of the entire Japanese garrison.

==Aftermath==
The survivors were transferred at Makin Lagoon from the destroyers onto the attack transports and . On Thanksgiving night, two of the survivors died, and were buried at sea. On 2 December, the navy announced that &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; had been sunk off Makin Island.

Over two months later, on 4 February 1944, &quot;I-175&quot; was detected and sunk by the destroyer and the destroyer escort , using their Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar.

===Legacy===
In the Chapel of St. Cornelius, located within Valley Forge Military Academy and College, two stained-glass windows, installed in 1965, act as a memorial to &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;. On the museum ship , a memorial plaque was installed in 1990 to the ship.

<text>The National Fancy Rat Society (NFRS), founded in 1976, is a UK-based club for rat fanciers that promotes fancy rats exhibitions, as well as the study and breeding of these rats. The society publishes a bi-monthly journal, &quot;Pro-Rat-A&quot;, and holds many shows throughout the year all over Britain, with membership in the thousands.

For a number of years pet rats had been appearing at mouse shows in Britain. Publicity in &quot;Fur &amp; Feather&quot; magazine had increased interest in the fledgling fancy and caused an increase in entries in the rat sections of mouse shows during 1974 and 1999 to the point that after cajoling from the mouse fanciers it was decided to form a club or society purely for rat fanciers.

== History ==
The National Fancy Rat Society was formed on 13 January 1976. The fledgling society staged its first exhibition just over a week later at the 1976 Bradford Championship Show, one of the most prestigious small livestock championship shows in the UK. This coincided with the debut of a new variety of fancy rat, the curly-coated Rex. The very first NFRS show was staged at Clymping, West Sussex, in conjunction with the Southern Hamster Club. It wasn&#x27;t until 15 April 1978 that the society staged a show entirely on its own; this show (in Surbiton, Surrey) was the very first all-rats show ever staged.

<text>A Mars rover is a remote-controlled motor vehicle designed to travel on the surface of Mars. Rovers have several advantages over stationary landers: they examine more territory, they can be directed to interesting features, they can place themselves in sunny positions to weather winter months, and they can advance the knowledge of how to perform very remote robotic vehicle control. They serve a different purpose than orbital spacecraft like &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot;. A more recent development is the Mars helicopter.

, there have been six successful robotically operated Mars rovers; the first five, managed by the American NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, were (by date of Mars landing): &quot;Sojourner&quot; (1997), &quot;Spirit&quot; (2004–2010), &quot;Opportunity&quot; (2004–2018), &quot;Curiosity&quot; (2012–present), and &quot;Perseverance&quot; (2021–present). The sixth, managed by the China National Space Administration, is &quot;Zhurong&quot; (2021–2022).

On January 24, 2016, NASA reported that then current studies on Mars by &quot;Opportunity&quot; and &quot;Curiosity&quot; would be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable. The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic carbon on Mars is now a primary NASA objective.

The Soviet probes, Mars 2 and Mars 3, were physically tethered probes; &quot;Sojourner&quot; was dependent on the Mars Pathfinder base station for communication with Earth; &quot;Opportunity&quot;, &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Curiosity&quot; were on their own. As of November 2023, &quot;Curiosity&quot; is still active, while &quot;Spirit&quot;, &quot;Opportunity&quot;, and &quot;Sojourner&quot; completed their missions before losing contact. On February 18, 2021, &quot;Perseverance&quot;, the newest American Mars rover, successfully landed. On May 14, 2021, China&#x27;s &quot;Zhurong&quot; became the first non-American rover to successfully operate on Mars.

==Missions==

Multiple rovers have been dispatched to Mars:
=== Active ===
* &quot;Curiosity&quot; of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission by NASA, was launched November 26, 2011 and landed at the Aeolis Palus plain near Aeolis Mons (informally &quot;Mount Sharp&quot;) in Gale Crater on August 6, 2012. The &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover is still operational as of 2025.
* &quot;Perseverance&quot; is NASA&#x27;s rover based on the successful &quot;Curiosity&quot; design. Launched with the Mars 2020 mission on July 30, 2020, it landed on February 18, 2021. It carried the Mars helicopter &quot;Ingenuity&quot; attached to its belly. Although &quot;Ingenuity&quot;&#x27;s mission has ended, &quot;Perseverance&quot; remains operational as of March 2024.

=== Past ===

* &quot;Sojourner&quot; rover, Mars Pathfinder, landed successfully on July 4, 1997. Communications were lost on September 27, 1997. &quot;Sojourner&quot; had traveled a distance of just over .
* &quot;Spirit&quot; (MER-A), Mars Exploration Rover (MER), launched on June 10, 2003, and landed on January 4, 2004. Nearly six years after the original mission limit, &quot;Spirit&quot; had covered a total distance of but its wheels became trapped in sand. The last communication received from the rover was on March 22, 2010, and NASA ceased attempts to re-establish communication on May 25, 2011.
* &quot;Opportunity&quot; (MER-B), Mars Exploration Rover, launched on July 7, 2003 and landed on January 25, 2004. &quot;Opportunity&quot; surpassed the previous records for longevity at 5,352 sols (5498 Earth days from landing to mission end; 15 Earth years or 8 Martian years) and covered . The rover sent its last status on 10 June 2018 when a global 2018 Mars dust storm blocked the sunlight needed to recharge its batteries. After hundreds of attempts to reactivate the rover, NASA declared the mission complete on February 13, 2019.
* &quot;Zhurong&quot; launched with the Tianwen-1 CNSA Mars mission on July 23, 2020, landed on May 14, 2021, in the southern region of Utopia Planitia, and deployed on May 22, 2021, while dropping a remote selfie camera on 1 June 2021. Designed for a lifespan of 90 sols (93 Earth days), &quot;Zhurong&quot; had been active for 347 sols (356.5 days) since its deployment and traveled on Mars&#x27;s surface for . Since 20 May 2022, the rover was deactivated due to approaching sandstorms and Martian winter. But the larger-than-expected build-up of dust covering its solar panels prevented it from self-reactivation. On 25 April 2023, the mission designer Zhang Rongqiao announced that the buildup of dust from the last inactivation is greater than planned, indicating the rover could be inactive &quot;forever&quot;.

===Failed===
* &quot;Mars 2&quot;, &quot;PrOP-M&quot; rover, 1971, &quot;Mars 2&quot; landing failed, destroying Prop-M with it. The &quot;Mars 2&quot; and &quot;3&quot; spacecraft from the Soviet Union had identical &quot;Prop-M&quot; rovers. They were to move on skis while connected to the landers with cables.
* &quot;Mars 3&quot;, &quot;PrOP-M&quot; rover, landed successfully on December 2, 1971. rover tethered to the Mars 3 lander. Lost when the &quot;Mars 3&quot; lander stopped communicating about 110 seconds after landing. The loss of communication may have been due to the extremely powerful Martian dust storm taking place at the time, or an issue with the Mars 3 orbiter&#x27;s ability to relay communications.

===Planned===
* ESA&#x27;s ExoMars rover &quot;Rosalind Franklin&quot; was confirmed technically ready for launch in March 2022 and planned to launch in September 2022, but due to the suspension of cooperation with Roscosmos this is delayed until at least 2028. A fast-track study was started to determine alternative launch options.
* The Russian Moscow Aviation Institute and the Indian IIT are jointly developing a fixed-wing Mars UAV which is scheduled for launch in late 2025.

===Proposed===
* The JAXA Melos rover was supposed to be launched in 2022. JAXA has not given an update since 2015.
* NASA Mars Geyser Hopper
* ISRO has proposed a Mars rover as part of Mars Lander Mission, its second Mars mission in 2030.
* &quot;Mars Tumbleweed Rover&quot;, a spherical wind-propelled rover. The concept was first investigated by NASA in the early 2000s. Since 2017, Team Tumbleweed has been developing a series of Tumbleweed Rovers. The research organization aims to land a swarm of 90 Tumbleweed rovers on the Martian surface by 2034.

===Undeveloped===
* Marsokhod was proposed to be a part of Russian Mars 96 mission.
* Astrobiology Field Laboratory, proposed in the 2000-2010 period as a follow on to MSL.
* Mars Astrobiology Explorer-Cacher (MAX-C), cancelled 2011
* Mars Surveyor 2001 rover
* Cushion-air rovers

==NASA Mars rover goals==

Circa the 2010s, NASA had established certain goals for the rover program.

NASA distinguishes between &quot;mission&quot; objectives and &quot;science&quot; objectives. Mission objectives are related to progress in space technology and development processes. Science objectives are met by the instruments during their mission in space.

The science instruments are chosen and designed based on the science objectives and goals. The primary goal of the &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot; rovers was to investigate &quot;the history of water on Mars&quot;.

The four science goals of NASA&#x27;s long-term Mars Exploration Program are:
* Determine whether life ever arose on Mars
* Characterize the climate of Mars
* Characterize the geology of Mars
* Prepare for human exploration of Mars

<text>Émile Basly (29 March 1854 – 11 February 1928) is one of the great figures of trade unionism in mining in the mineral field of Nord-Pas-de-Calais, France, along with Arthur Lamendin. He is primarily known for his participation in the strike of 1884, when he became known as &quot;the untameable miner&quot; and &quot;the tsar of Lens&quot;. He was the inspiration for the character &quot;Etienne Lantier&quot; in Émile Zola&#x27;s novel &quot;Germinal&quot;.

==Early years==

Émile Joseph Basly was born on 29 March 1854 in Valenciennes, Nord.
Basly entered mining as a &quot;galibot&quot; (minor) at the age of twelve. 
He was one of the leaders of the 1880 strike at the Compagnie des mines d&#x27;Anzin, which led to the creation in 1883 of the Union of Miners (Syndicat des ouvriers mineurs), of which Basly became general secretary.
After the creation of the Trade union of the minors of Anzin in 1882, Basly became its secretary, and subsequently its president in 1891.
He was delegate for the miners of Nord to the 1883 miners&#x27; congress in Saint-Étienne, where he vigorously supported their demands.

Another strike began at Anzin in February 1884 after 140 workers, mostly union members, were dismissed.
The company called in troops to defend the mines, and refused to make any concessions.
The strike lasted 56 days, and was headline news in France, but failed completely.
During this strike Basly emerged as a leader of the miners.
He became secretary general of the Nord miners&#x27; union, president of the Pas-de-Calais miners&#x27; union.
During the 1884 Anzin strike he came to Paris to defend the miners&#x27; grievances and demands before the Parliamentary Committee established to examine the strike.
He spoke in several public meetings, and became well known in the press for his strong socialist views.

==National deputy==

Basly was elected deputy for Pas-de-Calais on 4 October 1885.
Soon after the 1885 session opened Antide Boyer, Émile Basly, Zéphyrin Camélinat and others formed the &quot;workers&#x27; group&quot;, a small socialist group independent of the extreme left. The members of the workers&#x27; group summarized their demands in a manifesto on 12 March 1886:

Basly was reelected as Deputy for Pas-de-Calais on 22 February 1891, 20 August 1893, 8 May 1898, 27 April 1902, 6 May 1906, 24 April 1910, 26 April 1914, 16 November 1919 and 11 May 1924, holding office until his death on 11 February 1928. Basly became mayor of Lens in 1900, and devoted the last ten years of his life to rebuilding the city, which had been completely destroyed during First World War. He continued to serve as mayor until his death there in 1928. Émile Basly died on 11 February 1928 in Lens, Nord. Rue Émile Basly is a street in Avion, named in his honor.

<text>David Korner (also known as Barta, Albert, and A. Mathieu; October 19, 1914 – September 6, 1976) was a Romanian and French communist militant, trade unionist, and journalist. A Trotskyist for most of his life, he was active in the labor movement of France from the 1930s to the 1960s.

== Life and career ==
Born into a Jewish family, Korner was a member of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) in 1932–1933. In July 1933, alongside Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Constantin Doncea and other PCR activists, he was brought to trial in front of a Bucharest court for his part in convening the Griviţa Strike, and ultimately sentenced to 18 months in jail.

Recruited to Trotskyism as a student in Paris in the 1934, he formed the &quot;Bolshevik Leninist Group of Romania&quot; upon his return to Romania (April 1935). The latter faction opposed the Stalinist PCR, as well as the Social Democrats and the Unitary Socialist Party of Leon Ghelerter. When the Spanish Civil War and the June 1936 strikes took place, Korner again returned to France and was a member of the Internationalist Workers Party (POI).

In line with Leon Trotsky&#x27;s advice to his French followers to enter the Workers and Peasants Socialist Party (PSOP) he joined that party and stood on its far left (&quot;see French Turn&quot;). Upon the start of World War II, as the PSOP collapsed, he formed the tiny &quot;Trotskyist Group&quot; in opposition to what he considered the petty bourgeois methods of organization of the other French Trotskyist groups, as well as to the politics of mainstream socialist party (the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International). This group was active in clandestinity under the Nazi German occupation of France, and later became the &quot;Communist Union&quot; (UC).

The group concentrated on factory work but also maintained the regular production of its political publications and took part in agitation against the colonial politics of France. The factory work came to fruition with the Renault strike of 1947, which Korner&#x27;s group helped lead and organize. The request for support addressed by the newly formed Democratic Trade Union of Renault (SDR) was accepted by the UC, which effectively caused a merger between the two.

While the SDR broke apart in 1949, the political grouping was revived only briefly in 1950, without enlisting support; when some former militants of the UC began publishing &quot;Voix Ouvrière&quot; in 1956 (later known as &quot;Lutte Ouvrière&quot;), Barta did not partake in the move (although, as late as 1964, Bois, a leader of &quot;Voix Ouvrière&quot;, was still writing to him to request his involvement). Relations between Barta and the leadership of the &quot;Voix Ouvrière&quot; group remained poor until his death, in part because Barta believed that the group had wrongly appropriated his work and was philistine in its methods.

<doc id="421378" wikidata="Q1426142" url="?curid=421378" title="Vocal Group Hall of Fame">
<text>The Vocal Group Hall of Fame &amp; Museum Company Inc. was an American-based hall of fame that honored vocal groups throughout the United States. James E. Winner Jr. was the financial and managing partner of the For-profit corporation. Winner and Anthony F. Butala were the corporate officers/stockholders of The Museum Company. They set up an office located at Winner&#x27;s business address on State Street in Sharon, Pennsylvania.

Control of the hall of fame has changed over the years. It went into hiatus and was closed in 2008. 

==History== 
===Founding===
The Vocal Group Hall of Fame was conceived by Butala. He came up with the idea of the museum/hall of fame. Winner, a successful local businessman and entrepreneur, agreed to fund and operate the project. Butala is also the founding member of the famous 50s &amp; &#x27;60s singing group The Lettermen. He is the only living original member of The Lettermen and still performs with the group.

&quot;The Vocal Group Hall of Fame &amp; Museum Company Inc.&quot; opened in 1998 followed by The Vocal Group Hall of Fame 501 (c)3 Non-Profit Foundation. The foundation was formed and operated by attorneys and accountants employed by Winner.

The foundation was created to care for, protect and display the Inductees&#x27; memorabilia and to enjoy the benefits of a non-profit foundation. The foundation began collecting donations of memorabilia from the inductees and began seeking grants from the city of Sharon and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It also solicited donations from a hopeful supportive public.
Shortly after the foundation was created, Winner renovated the Museum building. He later opened the Museum and set up headquarters at the newly renovated museum building that he owned across the street from his offices in Sharon.
===2001===
Inductions were scheduled and promoted for September 11, 2001 (9/11). The Vocal Group Hall of Fame Inductions and were to be produced behind the museum building in a parking lot. The Vocal Group Hall of Fame Museum Company Inc. had begun the 2001 Inductions preparation, production, and promotion when the 9/11 terror attack crisis left artists/inductees unable to travel to Inductions. All airplanes had been grounded, causing the 2001 inductions to be postponed to October 4, 2001.

In the time between 9/11 and October 4, 2001, a few members of the Vocal Group Hall of Fame museum staff went to a concert at the nearby Cleveland Indians minor league baseball stadium in Ohio to see Cool &amp; the Gang, Village People and Disco Explosion. They liked the production and show management. The group made an offer to the concert producer. Bob Crosby. Cosby got his start in the entertainment business at Dick Clark Productions in 1976. He was contracted to produce the 2001 Vocal Group Hall of Fame Production. Crosby accepted the offer and successfully staged the concert. He recorded video and audio of the 2001 Inductions and marketed and packaged the first DVD of inductions.

Prior quarters and annual projections showed low attendance to the museum and unsatisfying ticket sales to both the museum and Inductions. This caused tensions between Winner and Butala. Batula was not very helpful because he was on tour most of the time with The Lettermen. This issue led to the resolution of all matters by dissolving the interest and partnership in the For-profit Vocal Group Hall of Fame and Museum Company Inc.

Butala wanted his dream to continue. He suggested to Winner to have Crosby take over the Vocal Group Hall of Fame Foundation and rent the museum building from Winner. Butala and Winner closed the Vocal Group Museum Company Inc. and Crosby took over operations of The Vocal Group Hall of Fame Foundation as President and CEO.

Soon after Crosby took over the operation and administration of the foundation, Winner&#x27;s attorneys and accountants, the board of directors of the foundation, resigned.

Within a couple of months of Crosby&#x27;s appointment as President and CEO of the foundation, he did not expect the rental price, $1 a year rent plus utilities and maintenance of the building, to change. However, the rent had increased to $12,000 per month. Other bills and debts not agreed to became the foundation&#x27;s responsibility instead of The Museum Company&#x27;s responsibility. Winner demanded that all museum renovation bills become foundation bill. This ended any chance for the foundation to survive with debt said to be over $1million. A final settlement was accepted after lawsuits were filed. There was no longer any financial obligation due to Winner by the foundation.

As differences grew, it became clear to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame Foundation that the Foundation could no longer afford to rent or occupy Winners museum building. The Foundation was not able to provide for the museum and the foundation&#x27;s past bills. It was left with no alternative other than to not renew the offered lease and find a new location.
===2002===
On June 14, 2002, The Vocal Group Hall of Fame Foundation purchased the 1750-seat 1922 Columbia Theatre, an early Warner Brothers theater in Sharon. They moved all the foundation&#x27;s memorability to storage and ended the lease in Winners building. The Foundation office relocated to the Columbia Theatre. The For-profit Vocal Group Hall of Fame Museum Company Inc. was closed.
==Inductions==
The Vocal Group Hall of Fame Foundation typically inducts sixteen Vocal Groups annually and has been delayed lacking the funding. Artists are inducted within categories. Each category has an original group member, evolved group member or a family member as an inductee representative. These categories include 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and duos. The Vocal Group Hall of Fame Foundation releases a public ballot that allowed anyone to vote for both the nominees and the inductees.
==Categories==
While only vocal groups having three-part harmony are eligible, other categories such as duos and Lead solo vocalists with a harmony group may be inducted if they have a legitimate backup harmony group with backing harmony singers. An example of this would be Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.
==Closure==
The Vocal Group Hall of Fame public operations, including the theater and museum, have been closed and on hiatus since 2008 due to the lack of financial support. It continues its mission to establish and operate a museum attraction where the inductees meet and perform in support of the foundation.

==Columbia Theatre==
On June 14, 2001, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame Foundation purchased the 1750-seat Columbia Theatre in Sharon &quot;with the promise of grant funding to follow&quot;. The Commonwealth did have a multi-million dollar grant if the foundation could meet the match. Over twenty years after it was first created, the Foundation has not opened the attraction or receive adequate funding. Much is still needed to renovate, open and operated the foundation&#x27;s attraction and become capable of raising funds on its own through benefit concerts at The Columbia Theatre. Meanwhile, the restoration of the theatre has stalled due to the lack of funding. A part of a new roof was installed and the plastering of the dome was completed to make a watertight shell.

The Mercer County Correctional Facility and volunteers removed more than 100 tons of debris to help make the theater ready for renovation.

In November 2004, the museum moved out of Winner&#x27;s 3-story building and relocated to the Columbia Theatre. All of the Foundations memorabilia was moved to temperature-controlled storage waiting for its new home for display. The new location at Columbia Theatre was meant to serve both as The Vocal Group Hall of Fame Foundation&#x27;s central office and as the location for the annual induction ceremony. It was also intended to host benefit concerts to support the foundation and theatre. The museum was to move to a three-story restaurant building purchased by the foundation. The building was located adjacent to the theater. It would have the restaurant portion becoming a vocal group-themed museum, nightclub piano bar and bar and grill.

==Truth in Music Bill==
The Truth in Music bill was created to protect artists from identity theft. Jon Bauman, chairmen of The Truth In Music Committee has worked with the VGHF. Along with Frank Maffei, bauman has had help from Joe Terry of Danny &amp; The Juniors, Maxine Pinkney of Bill Pinkney, The Original Drifters, Veta &amp; Carl Gardner of The Coasters, Herb Reed and Sonny Turner of The Platters and others. Bauman and Mary Wilson, with Bob Crosby at the foundation office, was able to assist other artists in an effort to protect the artist from fraudulent abuse. Wilson championed the Truth in Music bill for many years throughout the United States. With the help of The Recording Academy, she got Hawaii added to the list of states with the Truth In Music Bill as the 35th state to pass the bill also known as the Truth in Advertising Act. She was one of the best supporters of The Vocal Group Hall of Fame Foundation as Chair of the Artist Advisory Board and continued her support up until her death. The Truth In Music Bill has since been adopted by most U.S. states. It also helps ensure that people who perform in a group using a group&#x27;s name must actually perform on one of the group&#x27;s albums or has legal rights to use the name. The main beneficiaries are the surviving members of the Platters, The Coasters, The Drifters and the Marvelettes. These iconic groups had been victimized by Larry Marshak and other promoters of impostor groups.

<text>The first Irish prose fiction, in the form of legendary stories, appeared in the Irish language as early as the seventh century, along with chronicles and lives of saints in Irish and Latin. Such fiction was an adaptation and elaboration of earlier oral material and was the work of a learned class who had acquired literacy with the coming of Latin Christianity. A number of these stories were still available in manuscripts of the Late Middle Ages and even as late as the nineteenth century, though poetry was by that time the main literary vehicle of the Irish language.

The first notable English-language prose fiction in Ireland was the work of Jonathan Swift, who published &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; in 1726. Little of note appeared in English by any resident Irish writer until the nineteenth century, when a number of novelists came to prominence.

Modern prose fiction in Irish owes much to the Gaelic revival at the end of the nineteenth century, when cultural nationalists made a determined effort to create the conditions for a modern literature. A substantial body of short stories and novels appeared in Irish as a result.

Irish prose fiction in English attracted worldwide attention in the course of the twentieth century. Its greatest exponent was James Joyce, a highly influential modernist whose only rival in Irish was Máirtín Ó Cadhain.

Prose fiction in both languages has continued to flourish, with English being the primary vehicle. The short story has received particular attention, with a number of distinguished practitioners.

==Early and medieval period==

The earliest Irish prose fiction is a branch of heroic literature: stories dealing with supernatural personages and human heroes. One of the most famous is &quot;Táin Bó Cuailnge&quot;, together with its associated stories. It is thought to have been originally a seventh century text and deals with the conflict between Connacht and Ulster in the pre-Christian period. Another well-known tale is &quot;Scéla Mucc Meic Dathó&quot;, written c. 800 and dealing with the rivalries of a warrior aristocracy. &quot;Fled Bricrend&quot; is an inventive satire, recounting the conflict that follows the machinations of the malicious Bricriu. A number of famous tales are associated with narrative groupings known as the Ulster Cycle and the Cycle of the Kings. It has been noted that it is not heroic deeds per se that supply the interest of the stories, but the dramatic consequences that flow from those exploits. The stories are notable for the importance of the female protagonists.

The coming of the Anglo-Normans in the twelfth century brought with it new literary influences. By the fourteenth century translations were being made into Irish from other languages. Among these were &quot;Merugad Uilis mac Leirtis&quot;, a prose adaptation from the Odyssey via Latin, and &quot;Stair Ercuil agus a bhás&quot;, a fifteenth century composition translated from the English version of a French work. Arthurian tales or works showing Arthurian influence were popular in Irish, and two English tales, &quot;Bevis of Hampton&quot; and &quot;Sir Guy of Warwick&quot;, were also translated.

==1600 to 1800==

The outstanding fictional prose work of seventeenth century Ireland is &quot;Pairlement Chloinne Tomáis&quot;, a Rabelaisian satire written by members of the Gaelic elite on what they saw as the upstart lower classes, who were taking advantage of the disruption to the social order caused by the weakening of the old Irish nobility. This work was popular and influential, with its hero, Tomás Mac Lóbais, becoming a proverbial figure. Its themes were reflected in a number of other satires or burlesque tales of the period.

The late seventeenth century saw the birth in Dublin of Jonathan Swift (1667 – 1745), a satirist and clergyman who in 1726 published the first great work by an Anglo-Irish writer, &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. Though this had no specifically Irish relevance, it set a standard for later writers in English.

The eighteenth century saw the birth in Ireland of two distinguished novelists, Laurence Sterne (1713 – 1768) and Oliver Goldsmith (1728 – 1774), both of whom, however, made their careers in England. Despite this, their oeuvre is often included in the Anglo-Irish literary canon. Sterne published &quot;The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman&quot; (1759–1767), a satire on the biographical novel. Goldsmith, best known as a poet, published &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot; (1766), written in a direct and conversational style uncommon at the time.

Irish was still Ireland&#x27;s most important literary language in the eighteenth century, but little prose was produced. The emphasis, instead, was on poetry, with such prominent literary figures as the Munster writer Aogán Ó Rathaille.

==19th century==
The 19th century saw a burgeoning of Anglo-Irish prose fiction, but literary output in Irish diminished dramatically.

Maria Edgeworth (1767–1849), though of English birth, spent most of her life in Ireland and wrote what is generally considered the first novel on an Irish theme, &quot;Castle Rackrent&quot; (1800), describing landlord-tenant relations on an Irish estate. A number of other novels followed. Lady Morgan (Sidney Owenson) (1776(?)-1859) was also a prolific writer. Her most successful work was her third novel, &quot;The Wild Irish Girl&quot; (1806), a work marked by Jacobin feminist politics.

Charles Robert Maturin (1782–1824) was best known for &quot;Melmoth the Wanderer&quot; (1820), a Faustian tale of a man who sells his soul to the devil.

William Carleton (1794–1869) and John Banim (1798–1842) wrote novels that depicted with some realism the lives of Irish peasantry. The latter often wrote in collaboration with his brother Michael Banim (1796–1874). All these writers came from the world they depicted. Gerald Griffin (1803–1840) was born in Limerick but spent time in England. On returning to Ireland he wrote &quot;The Collegians&quot;, on which his reputation rests.

Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu (1814–1873) was born in Dublin and lived there for most of his life. He was noted for his mystery novels and Gothic fiction (some of which is based on Irish folklore). Bram Stoker (1847–1912), a writer of similar interests, was born in Dublin but spent much his life in England. He wrote many books but is best known for &quot;Dracula&quot;, one of the most famous novels in the Gothic tradition.

Charles Kickham (1828–1882) was born in County Tipperary. He served a term in prison for treasonous activities and began writing novels there. His &quot;Knocknagow; or The Homes of Tipperary&quot; (1879) was the most popular Irish novel of the 19th century.

Edith Anna Somerville (1858–1949) and her cousin, Violet Florence Martin (1862–1915) wrote in collaboration and popularised the &quot;big house&quot; novel, based on the life of the Irish gentry class to which they themselves belonged. Their books include &quot;The Irish R.M.&quot; and &quot;The Real Charlotte&quot;.

George Moore (1852–1933) spent much of his early career in Paris and was one of the first writers to use the techniques of the French realist novelists in English. His novels were often controversial for their frankness. His short stories helped popularise the form among Irish authors.

The persistence of traditional genres in Irish can be seen in the papers of Amhlaoibh Ó Súilleabháin, a Kilkenny schoolteacher, merchant and diarist of the early nineteenth century. Like many other local Irish scholars at the time, he assembled a comprehensive manuscript collection of earlier Irish prose, and also wrote prose sketches himself, though these remained unpublished.

==1900 on==

===Fiction in English===

James Joyce (1882–1941) is often regarded as the father of the literary technique known as &quot;stream of consciousness&quot;, best exemplified in his famous work &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Joyce also wrote &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, &quot;Dubliners&quot;, and the semi-autobiographical &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;. &quot;Ulysses&quot;, often considered to be the greatest novel of the 20th century, is the story of a day in the life of a city, Dublin. &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; is written in an invented language which parodies English, Irish and Latin.

Samuel Beckett (1906–1989), who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969, was born in Dublin but later moved to France. He wrote thereafter in French and English. Best known for his plays, he also wrote works of fiction, including his trilogy &quot;Molloy&quot;, &quot;Malone Dies&quot; and &quot;The Unnamable&quot; (originally written in French).

Aidan Higgins (1927 – 2015) wrote an experimental version of the big house novel called &quot;Langrishe, Go Down&quot;. He also published short stories and several volumes of memoirs, often in an experimental vein. More conventional exponents of the big house novel include Elizabeth Bowen (1899–1973), whose novels and short stories include &quot;Encounters&quot; (1923), &quot;The Last September&quot; (1929), and &quot;The Death of the Heart&quot; (1938) and Molly Keane (1904–1996) (writing as M.J. Farrell), author of &quot;Young Entry&quot; (1928), &quot;Conversation Piece&quot; (1932), &quot;Devoted Ladies&quot; (1934), &quot;Full House&quot; (1935), &quot;The Loving Without Tears&quot; (1951) and other works.

Francis Stuart (1902–2000) published his first novel, &quot;Women and God&quot; in 1931. He was a prolific novelist. He went to work in Germany in the 1930s and his reputation was affected by his decision to remain there during World War II, broadcasting anti-British talks on German radio. His novel &quot;Black List, Section H&quot; (1971), is a fictionalised account of those years.

With the rise of the Irish Free State and the Republic of Ireland, some authors began to write of the lives of the lower-middle classes and small farmers. Exponents of this genre include Brinsley MacNamara (1890–1963) (real name John Weldon), whose 1918 &quot;The Valley of the Squinting Windows&quot; was the first novel in this genre, and John McGahern (1934 – 2006), whose first novel, &quot;The Dark&quot; (1965), depicted child abuse in a rural community. The Catholic conscience in the modern world was examined by Brian Moore (1921–1999), who was born in Belfast but became a citizen of Canada in 1953.

J. G. Farrell (1935–79) was born in Liverpool of Anglo-Irish parents, but lived intermittently in Ireland after World War II. His works include a novel called &quot;Troubles&quot;, set during the Irish War of Independence (1919 – 1921), and this has led some to regard him as an Irish novelist. He acquired a high critical reputation.

Brian O&#x27;Nolan (known by the pen name Flann O&#x27;Brien) is best known for two works in English, the surrealistic and satirical &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; (1939), highly praised by Joyce, and &quot;The Third Policeman&quot;, published in 1967, after his death. But he was also the author of &quot;An Béal Bocht&quot; (1941), a satire in Irish on Gaeltacht autobiographies, later translated as &quot;The Poor Mouth&quot;.

The short story has also proven popular with Irish fiction writers. Well-known writers in the genre include Frank O&#x27;Connor (1903–1966) and Seán Ó Faoláin (1900–1991).

Notable names straddling the late 20th and early 21st-century include John Banville, Sebastian Barry, Gerard Beirne, Dermot Bolger, Seamus Deane, Dermot Healy, Jennifer Johnston, Eugene McCabe, Patrick McCabe, John McGahern, Edna O&#x27;Brien, Colm Tóibín, William Trevor and William Wall. Writers to have emerged in the 21st-century include Claire Keegan, Philip Ó Ceallaigh, Cónal Creedon, Jamie O&#x27;Neill and Keith Ridgway.

Recent fiction by Irish writers has attracted attention in the neighbouring United Kingdom. Some writers have won the Booker Prize, with others being shortlisted. Among Ireland&#x27;s Booker winners are &quot;Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha&quot; by Roddy Doyle and &quot;The Gathering&quot; by Anne Enright. John Banville&#x27;s &quot;The Sea&quot; won in 2005, though it proved a controversial choice. Banville has also won other international awards, including the Franz Kafka Prize and the Austrian State Prize for European Literature, and has been mentioned as the next Irish contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

There has been a rise in the amount of popular fiction being published in a range of genres, including romantic novels and detective stories set in New York. The 21st-century has also brought an increased emphasis on writing by women, which found concrete expression in the founding of the publishers Arlen House. Irish writers of a commercial bent include Cecelia Ahern (&quot;PS, I Love You&quot;), Maeve Binchy (&quot;Tara Road&quot;), John Boyne (&quot;The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas&quot;), Marian Keyes (&quot;Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married&quot;) and Joseph O&#x27;Connor (&quot;Cowboys and Indians&quot;, &quot;Desperadoes&quot;).

===Fiction in Irish===

Fiction in Irish was greatly stimulated by the Gaelic revival, which insisted on the need for a modern literature. The first novel in Irish (an historical romance) was written by Patrick S. Dinneen, lexicographer and literary scholar. He was followed by Father Peadar Ua Laoghaire, who in the 1890s published, in a serialised form, a folkloristic novel strongly influenced by the storytelling tradition of the Gaeltacht, called &quot;&quot;. His other works include retellings of classical Irish stories.

Among the many writers who published prose fiction in Irish in the first decades of the twentieth century, two stood out: Patrick Pearse and Pádraig Ó Conaire. Pearse wrote elegant, idealised stories about the Irish-speaking countryside. Ó Conaire was a realist, dealing with urban as well as rural life, but also wrote an absurdist novel called &quot;Deoraíocht&quot;, unlike anything else published at the time. They were followed by two brothers, Séamus Ó Grianna and Seosamh Mac Grianna, who wrote in quite different ways about the Gaeltacht community in which they had grown up. Seosamh in particular was concerned with the psychological and emotional struggle involved in the transition to modernity.

The most prominent literary modernist was Máirtín Ó Cadhain, a native speaker who looked at his own community with a critical eye. His masterpiece was the novel &quot;Cré na Cille&quot;, filled with the voices of the quarrelling dead. He published several collections of short stories, adapting his writing style over time to an urban milieu. The best known modernists to follow him were not of Gaeltacht background: Eoghan Ó Tuairisc, Diarmaid Ó Súilleabháin, and Breandán Ó Doibhlin (the last influenced by French literary theory). Ó Tuairisc was a stylistic innovator; Ó Súilleabháin was immersed in the middle-class urban world; Ó Doibhlin was more introspective in his approach.

The Gaeltacht, though in linguistic decline, has continued to produce novelists and short story writers such as Pádraig Breathnach, Micheál Ó Conghaile, Pádraig Ó Cíobháin and Joe Steve Ó Neachtain.

There have also been contributions to more popular genres. They include the work of Cathal Ó Sándair (1922–1996), a prolific author whose oeuvre included westerns. Éilís Ní Dhuibhne has written popular murder mysteries.

The short story remains a popular genre in Irish as in English. Donncha Ó Céileachair and Síle Ní Chéileachair, brother and sister, published the influential collection &quot;Bullaí Mhártain&quot; in 1955. In 1953 Liam O&#x27;Flaherty published the collection &quot;Dúil&quot;, his only work in Irish. One of the best known of contemporary practitioners is Seán Mac Mathúna (who also writes in English). His work is characterised by humour and a poetic realism and has been praised for its originality. The work of Daithí Ó Muirí is distinguished by its black humour and absurdist quality, a contrast to the social realism of much modern writing in Irish. A recent development has been an increase in the number of women writers, including Orna Ní Choileáin, Méadhbh Ní Ghallchobhair, Deirdre Ní Ghrianna and others.

<doc id="421387" wikidata="Q692298" url="?curid=421387" title="Sabotage (Black Sabbath album)">
<text>Sabotage is the sixth studio album by English rock band Black Sabbath, released on 28 July 1975. The album was recorded in the midst of a legal battle with the band&#x27;s former manager, Patrick Meehan. The stress that resulted from the band&#x27;s ongoing legal woes infiltrated the recording process, inspiring the album&#x27;s title. It was co-produced by guitarist Tony Iommi and Mike Butcher.

== Recording ==
Black Sabbath began work on their sixth album in February 1975, again in England, at Morgan Studios in Willesden, London. The title &quot;Sabotage&quot; was chosen because the band was at the time being sued by their former management and felt they were being &quot;sabotaged all the way along the line and getting punched from all sides&quot;, according to Iommi. &quot;It was probably the only album ever made with lawyers in the studio,&quot; said drummer Bill Ward. Iommi credits those legal troubles for the album&#x27;s angry, heavier sound.

In 2001, bassist Geezer Butler explained to Dan Epstein, &quot;Around the time of &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;, we found out that we were being ripped off by our management and our record company. So, much of the time, when we weren&#x27;t onstage or in the studio, we were in lawyer&#x27;s offices trying to get out of all our contracts. We were literally in the studio, trying to record, and we&#x27;d be signing all these affidavits and everything. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called &quot;Sabotage&quot; – because we felt that the whole process was just being totally sabotaged by all these people ripping us off.&quot; In his autobiography &quot;I Am Ozzy&quot;, singer Ozzy Osbourne confirms that &quot;writs were being delivered to us at the mixing desk&quot; and that Ward &quot;was manning the phones&quot;. In the liner notes to the 1998 live album &quot;Reunion&quot;, Butler claimed the band suffered through 10 months of legal cases and admitted, &quot;Music became irrelevant to me. It was a relief just to write a song.&quot;

Iommi later reflected, &quot;We could&#x27;ve continued and gone on and on, getting more technical, using orchestras and everything else, which we didn&#x27;t particularly want to. We took a look at ourselves, and we wanted to do a rock album – &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; wasn&#x27;t a rock album, really.&quot; According to the book &quot;How Black Was Our Sabbath&quot;, &quot;The recording sessions would usually carry on into the middle of the night. Tony Iommi was working really hard on the production side of things with the band&#x27;s co-producer Mike Butcher, and he was spending a lot of time working out his guitar sounds. Bill, too, was experimenting with the drums, especially favouring the &#x27;backwards cymbal&#x27; effect.&quot; Osbourne, however, grew frustrated with how long Black Sabbath albums were taking to record, writing in his autobiography, &quot;&quot;Sabotage&quot; took about four thousand years.&quot;

According to Iommi, the &quot;Sabotage&quot; sessions were the scene of a legendary jam session between Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin. Iommi&#x27;s recollection may be inaccurate, however, as records show that Zeppelin were on tour in the US at the time &quot;Sabotage&quot; was being recorded. Ward&#x27;s recollection of the exact timing of the Zeppelin jam session is also fuzzy. &quot;I don&#x27;t even know what album we were working on&quot;, the drummer explained. &quot;But one of John (Bonham)&#x27;s favourite songs was &#x27;Supernaut&#x27; – so, when they came down to the studio, he wanted to jam &#x27;Supernaut&#x27;.&quot; It is more likely that the jam session took place during the recording of the previous album, &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;.

==Composition==
&quot;Sabotage&quot; is a mix of heavy, powerful songs and experimental tunes such as &quot;Supertzar&quot; and &quot;Am I Going Insane (Radio)&quot;. In 2013, &quot;Mojo&quot; observed, &quot;Opener &#x27;Hole in the Sky&#x27; and the crunching &#x27;Symptom of the Universe&#x27; illustrate that, for all their problems, Sabbath&#x27;s power remained undimmed on what was what many consider one of their finest offerings.&quot; In the article &quot;Thrash Metal - An Introduction&quot; in &quot;University Times Magazine&quot;, Vladimir Rakhmanin cites &quot;Symptom of the Universe&quot; as one of the earliest examples of thrash metal, a heavy metal subgenre which emerged in the early 1980s. Tony Iommi describes the song&#x27;s dynamics in his autobiography &quot;Iron Man&quot;: &quot;It starts with an acoustic bit. Then it goes into the up-tempo stuff to give it that dynamic, and it does have a lot of changes to it, including the jam at the end.&quot; The final part of &quot;Symptom of the Universe&quot; evolved from an in-studio improvisation, created very spontaneously in a single day, and the decision was made to use it in that song. The English Chamber Choir was brought in to perform the song &quot;Supertzar&quot;. When vocalist Ozzy Osbourne arrived at the studio and saw them, he thought he was in the wrong studio and left. The title of the pop-leaning &quot;Am I Going Insane (Radio)&quot; caused some confusion due to the &quot;(Radio)&quot; part, which led people to believe the song was a radio cut or radio version. However, this is the only version of the song: the term &quot;radio-rental&quot; is rhyming slang for &quot;mental&quot;.

&quot;The Writ&quot; is one of only a handful of Black Sabbath songs to feature lyrics composed by vocalist Osbourne, who typically relied on bassist Butler for lyrics. The song was inspired by the frustrations Osbourne felt at the time, as Black Sabbath&#x27;s former manager Patrick Meehan was suing the band after having been fired. The song viciously attacks the music business in general and is a savage diatribe directed towards Meehan specifically (&quot;Are you Satan? Are you man?&quot;), with Osbourne revealing in his memoir, &quot;I wrote most of the lyrics myself, which felt a bit like seeing a shrink. All the anger I felt towards Meehan came pouring out.&quot; During this period, the band began to question if there was any point to recording albums and touring endlessly &quot;just to pay the lawyers&quot;. Thematically, &quot;The Writ&quot; and &quot;Megalomania&quot; are intertwined, according to drummer Ward, as they both deal with the same tensions arising from these ongoing legal troubles.

The brief instrumental &quot;Don&#x27;t Start (Too Late)&quot; is an acoustic guitar showpiece for Iommi, titled for tape operator David Harris, who often despaired at Sabbath being prone to start playing before he was ready.

==Artwork==
&quot;Sabotage&quot;″s front cover art has garnered mixed reactions over the years and is regarded by some as one of the worst album covers in rock history. The inverted mirror concept was conceived by Graham Wright, Bill Ward&#x27;s drum tech, who was also a graphic artist. The band attended what they believed was a test photo shoot for the album cover, thus explaining their choice of clothing. Said Ward, &quot;The only thing we didn&#x27;t discuss was what we&#x27;d all wear on the day of the shot. Since that shoot day, the band has survived through a tirade of clothing comments and jokes that continue to this day&quot;. Ward, in fact, was wearing his wife&#x27;s red tights in the photo. Wright recalls in the book &quot;How Black Was Our Sabbath&quot; that the plan was for each band member to appear on the cover dressed in black and had been instructed to bring some stage clothes for preliminary photos, but when they arrived, no black costumes had been laid out by the designers, and &quot;the original concept had been overruled.&quot; The designers &quot;carried on with the shoot, explaining they would superimpose the images at a later stage and that it would look great, to be honest. The session was unbelievably rushed, and the outcome was far from what had been originally envisaged. Ironically, the sleeve design that was intended to illustrate the idea of sabotage had instead become a victim of sabotage itself. By the time they saw it, it was too late to change.&quot;

&quot;Sabotage&quot; was released in the United States in July 1975, peaking at the Billboard 200 at number 28 and released in September 1975 in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number 7. The album was certified Silver (60,000 units sold) in the UK by the BPI on 1 December 1975 and Gold in the US on 16 June 1997, but was the band&#x27;s first release not to achieve platinum status in the US. For the second time, a Black Sabbath album initially saw favourable reviews, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stating, &quot;&quot;Sabotage&quot; is not only Black Sabbath&#x27;s best record since &quot;Paranoid&quot;, it might be their best ever.&quot; Later reviews were also favourable; Greg Prato of AllMusic said that &quot;&quot;Sabotage&quot; is the final release of Black Sabbath&#x27;s legendary First Six&quot; but noted that &quot;the magical chemistry that made such albums as &quot;Paranoid&quot; and &quot;Vol. 4&quot; so special was beginning to disintegrate.&quot; Guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen told Nick Bowcott of &quot;Guitar Player&quot; in 2008 that the riff to &quot;Symptom of the Universe&quot; was the first Tony Iommi riff he ever heard and that &quot;Tony&#x27;s use of the flat fifth would have got him burned at the stake a couple hundred years ago.&quot; In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it 32nd on their &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot; list.

In 1991, Chuck Eddy ranked &quot;Sabotage&quot; 20th in his 1991 book of the 500 best heavy metal albums, naming it the band&#x27;s best and most eccentric album, consisting of &quot;strange cut-up pastiches inside stranger cut-up pastiches&quot; that hark back to the Firesign Theatre and William Burroughs and ahead to Queensrÿche&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1988). He added: &quot;Everything—concise solos, voices chanting &#x27;opcit, opsist, obsessed...&#x27;, evil laughs, seven seconds from some ancient jugband 78, choruses grunting &#x27;suck me!&#x27;—jumps out from nowhere. Like in a great hip-hop mix, every sound disorients you, surprises you, but somehow every sound fits so perfectly that you couldn&#x27;t imagine it anywhere else&quot;. Rob Michaels of the &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; comments that the album&#x27;s use of strings and &quot;studio trickery&quot; represented a maturation over &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;, resulting in the group&#x27;s most consistent recording.

The band toured the US in support of &quot;Sabotage&quot; in 1975, which included a filmed appearance for the prestigious series &quot;Don Kirshner&#x27;s Rock Concert&quot; at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. Sabbath played &quot;Killing Yourself to Live&quot;, &quot;Hole in the Sky&quot;, &quot;Snowblind&quot;, &quot;War Pigs&quot; and &quot;Paranoid&quot;. During Iommi&#x27;s guitar solo during &quot;Snowblind&quot;, plastic snowflakes were dropped from above on the audience and the band, a gimmick used during the band&#x27;s live shows during this period. According to the book &quot;How Black Was Our Sabbath&quot;, &quot;The audience was limited to just a couple thousand fans, and it seemed like the whole of LA got wind of it.&quot; Due to the band&#x27;s expanding use of orchestras and other new sounds in the studio, the tour in support of &quot;Sabotage&quot; was the first in which Black Sabbath used a full-time keyboardist onstage, Gerald &quot;Jezz&quot; Woodroffe. Black Sabbath toured with openers Kiss but were forced to cut the tour short in November 1975 after vocalist Osbourne was injured in a motorcycle accident.

<text>Alan Thornett (born 15 June 1937) is a British Trotskyist.

Alan Thornett began his career as a car worker in Plant Oxford, Cowley, Oxford in 1959. He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain there in 1960 before being recruited with other shop stewards to Gerry Healy&#x27;s then Socialist Labour League in 1966. However, in 1974 he and most of the Cowley group were expelled - from what had become the Workers Revolutionary Party the previous year - with around 200 other members. Around a hundred of them went on to form the Workers Socialist League (WSL) of which Thornett was a leader. It established an international tendency, the Trotskyist International Liaison Committee, and fused with the International-Communist League in 1981. Political differences emerged in the new organisation with parts of the ex-WSL splitting off before those remaining were expelled in 1984.

Thornett and his comrades regrouped as the Socialist Group and then fused with the International Group to form the International Socialist Group (ISG) in 1987; the ISG dissolved into Socialist Resistance in 2009. Thornett is now a leader of the Fourth International.

Thornett successfully argued for the ISG to exit the Labour Party and join the Socialist Alliance. Later, he supported the Alliance&#x27;s dissolution in favour of the Respect Coalition. In the 2007 split in Respect, the ISG sided with the Respect Renewal faction around George Galloway against the SWP. Thornett sat on Respect&#x27;s National Council until Socialist Resistance left Respect in 2010.

Thornett is the author of three volumes of autobiography: &quot;From Militancy to Marxism&quot;, &quot;Inside Cowley&quot; and &quot;Militant Years&quot;, and of &quot;Facing the Apocalypse - Arguments for Ecosocialism&quot;

<doc id="421395" wikidata="Q16846238" url="?curid=421395" title="North Caledonian Football Association">
<text>The North Caledonian Football Association is a senior football association operating throughout the Highlands and Islands of Scotland and is a recognised body of the Scottish Football Association (SFA) and as such has its senior football competitions officially registered with the SFA.

== History ==
The formation of the Inverness Junior Football Association on 31 January 1888 saw the introduction of the Inverness Junior Cup. After the final in 1888 the association was renamed the North of Scotland Junior Football Association and the competition the North of Scotland Junior Cup.

The Association&#x27;s league competition was later introduced in 1896 as the &quot;North of Scotland Junior League&quot; with the initial aim of providing a league format for its junior members and predominantly the &quot;2nd XI&quot; teams from senior Highland Football League clubs. Upon its formation these teams mostly came from the Inverness area. By 1906 though, the Association had welcomed several new member teams from outside the Inverness-shire area, specifically Nairn Thistle and Dingwall Victoria United (later re-formed as Ross County) broadening the coverage of the league across the North. Other clubs from across the Highland counties followed suit, with Muir of Ord and Tore United among those to join.

In 1935 the league dropped its junior status, possibly due to the Scottish Junior Football Association&#x27;s objections to Senior clubs involvement, and became known as the North of Scotland &quot;2nd XI&quot; League (it was also known colloquially as either the Highland Reserve League or Highland Alliance, the latter a nod to the southern reserve league the Scottish Football Alliance). It was recognised as a senior football league with teams eligible to apply for Scottish FA membership.

In 1947–48 season, the league&#x27;s membership consisted of a record 26 clubs, split into a three-division regional set-up with the top clubs in each section playing off for the Championship. In 1948 it reverted to a single division with a much reduced membership.

By the late 1960s/early 1970s, the Highland League reserve teams which had dominated the league gradually dropped out of contention, with most finding that it was not financially viable to run &quot;2nd XI&quot; or reserve teams at a senior level. At the same time, the league began to see an influx of senior football teams joining from the surrounding counties of Easter Ross, Caithness and Sutherland.

By the 1980s, the league had representation from teams all across the North, including as far as Fort William. In a bid to shake off the &quot;2nd XI&quot; tag (and the inference of being &quot;second best&quot; to the Highland League) the member clubs in the league took the decision to rename the league at the 1984 annual general meeting of the North of Scotland 2nd XI Football Association in Bonar Bridge, where teams voted unanimously to change the name of the association to the North Caledonian Football Association and the name of the league competition to the North Caledonian Football League.

In 2020, it was announced that the North Caledonian League was working with the Highland League and North Region Junior FA to form a sixth tier of the Scottish football league system for the far north of the country, with a view to feeding eligible clubs via promotion into the Highland League. It was also announced, along with 4 teams being added to the ranks (2 of which are returning sides) that the league would be temporarily split into two divisions.

In April 2021, it was announced that subject to SFA approval, the North Caledonian League would be joined at Tier 6 by the North Super League and a rebranded Midlands League (the remaining Junior East Region clubs that play in Tayside) to form a fully-integrated tier below the Highland League from the 2021-22 season. The leagues at that level entered the Scottish pyramid later in July.

In June 2022, it was announced that the winner of the league, no matter whether they were SFA Licensed or not, would qualify directly to the Scottish Cup preliminary round, starting with Invergordon, who won the 2021-22 season. However, it was also confirmed that if an already SFA Licensed team (Golspie Sutherland and Fort William) or a reserve team (Clachnacuddin and Nairn County) were to win the league, the Scottish Cup spot would not pass down to the highest ranked team that would otherwise be eligible. Invergordon became the first team to qualify for the Scottish Cup via this method, however they were beaten 5–1 in their opening game by Newtongrange Star.

== Membership ==
As well as holding membership of the North Caledonian FA, member clubs are also governed by the constitution of the Scottish Football Association, and as such disciplinary and registration matters are handled by the Scottish Football Association. This is a unique situation in that member clubs are not required to be full members of the Scottish Football Association, despite their players holding senior SFA registrations (professional and amateur).

Golspie Sutherland are the only North Caledonian FA member club to hold full membership of the Scottish Football Association and since season 2007–08 they have obtained direct entry to the Scottish Cup. Previously, they were required to enter the Scottish Qualifying Cup (North).

Since 2013, membership has been extended beyond the Highlands to senior clubs in the Islands, with Orkney, Shetland and Lewis &amp; Harris all entering teams.

Member teams have previously included reserve teams of Highland Football League clubs alongside teams from throughout the Highlands and Islands region.

== Competitions ==
=== North Caledonian League ===
A senior Scottish FA registered competition, the North Caledonian League is an annual league competition which runs from July/August to April, with teams playing each other both home and away with a championship team determined after all games have been played.

Over the years, the North Caledonian League has been characterised by the number of clubs who have used it as a &#x27;stepping-stone&#x27; to the professional ranks of Scottish football. Among those to have &#x27;graduated&#x27; from the league are Wick Academy and Fort William who left to join the Highland Football League, and much earlier Ross County, who played in the league under their former name of Dingwall Victoria United between 1896 and 1929 before renaming to join the Highland Football League.

The league has also been home in recent years to the reserve teams of Scottish Football League clubs Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Ross County.

=== Cups ===
The North Caledonian Cup (also previously referred to as the North of Scotland Reserve Cup or PCT North Cup) was the first competition to be contested under the auspices of the North Caledonian FA during the latter part of the 1887–88 season and it remains part of the season calendar today. Member teams of the North Caledonian FA also compete in the Football Times Cup, which has existed as part of the North Caledonian FA season since the 1920s.

Several other cups have been contested or awarded during the Association&#x27;s history, each of which are inactive or played for when season time allows:
* Jock Mackay Memorial Cup
*Chic Allan/Port Services Cup
* Morris Newton/SWL Cup
* Ness Cup (revived as the &#x27;Division 2&#x27; trophy for the 2020–21 season)

==Recent history==
The 2008–09 season saw the league reduced to ten teams following the withdrawal of Dornoch City and Inverness City joining the Junior leagues. Late applicants Tain Thistle took the league membership up to ten teams for the start of the season. Fort William entered a reserve side in the league for season 2009–10 as the first Highland Football League &quot;reserve&quot; side to compete since 1999. Helmsdale based Bunillidh Thistle withdrew whilst Alness United took a year out, and former members Dingwall Thistle returned to complete a ten-team league. Season 2010–11 saw Alness return after a one-year absence whilst Tain Thistle withdrew after two seasons.

Clachnacuddin again entered a reserve side for season 2011–12, whilst Fort William Reserves dropped out due to problems with pitch availability. Before the season started, both Bonar Bridge and Invergordon withdrew, leaving just eight teams in the league. The following season 2012–13, Invergordon returned while Balintore and Dingwall Thistle both withdrew from the league.

Invergordon again withdrew from competition for the 2013–14 season, however, the void was filled by a new team from Dornoch in Sutherland United. That same season, a newly formed Shetland team and Lewis &amp; Harris both registered for competition in the North Caledonian Cup. The following season, 2014–15, Shetland and Lewis &amp; Harris also competed in the Jock Mackay Cup, while a new team, Orkney, was accepted as a member of the league – the first Islands team to be admitted. Invergordon returned a year later following a two-year period of abeyance, however, along with Muir of Ord Rovers, Sutherland United withdrew from the competition after just their second season, taking the number of competing teams down to six for season 2015–16.

The league experienced an upturn in interest from Highland sides in 2016. A total of eight teams registered for league competition in 2016–17, with St Duthus returning to represent Tain and a new team Inverness Athletic was also accepted. The league grew in numbers again in 2017 with the revival of Bunillidh Thistle after almost ten years absence, and for the 2019–20 season, Bonar Bridge reformed and were admitted to the league.

In 2020, two new clubs, Loch Ness and Scourie joined the league, along with returnees, Nairn County &#x27;A&#x27; and Alness United - taking the membership of the league to 13 teams for the first time in over 20 years. For the 2020–21 season, clubs agreed to play in two leagues of six (Bunillidh opted out) during the COVID-19 pandemic as a means of reducing the number of games, with Golspie winning League One, and Alness winning League Two. In 2021–22, Scourie folded after losing all 10 of their games the previous season, and Bunillidh again opted out and Invergordon qualified for the Scottish Cup after winning the title. In 2022–23, Fort William and Clachnacuddin Reserves returned to the league after 36 and 10 years, respectively.

In the 2024–25 season, Loch Ness pulled out before the season began and, for the first time since 2020, Bunillidh Thistle returned to the league, with a new side, Inverness Thistle, entering discussions to join the league for the 2025–26 season.

<text>The Scottish Junior Football Association (SJFA) is an affiliated national association of the Scottish Football Association and is the governing body for the junior grade of football in Scotland. The term &quot;junior&quot; refers to the level of football played, not the age of the players. The closest equivalent terminology would be non-League football in England, the difference being that junior football in Scotland was not similarly integrated into its football league system until 2021.

Founded in 1886, the SJFA is responsible for disciplinary matters within the grade, certain player registration procedures and organising the annual Scottish Junior Cup. Other league and cup competitions are organised by regional committees. The association headquarters are at Hampden Park, Glasgow, which is Scotland&#x27;s national football stadium. There was an earlier Scottish Junior FA, which was founded in Glasgow in October 1880. This body also ran a Scottish Junior Cup competition during 1880–81 season but appears to have disbanded at the end of that season.

== History ==

The SJFA was formed in Glasgow on 2 October 1886 and the first season&#x27;s Junior Cup saw 39 clubs take part. Junior football had existed since the early 1880s, initially as separate local associations across Scotland for clubs not in membership of the SFA. This new national association acted as an umbrella for these local junior associations, as well as establishing the Scottish Junior Cup, a national cup competition. The first three winners of the Scottish Junior Cup all joined the SFA and stepped up to senior level. Gradually, a number of junior leagues grew in strength — particularly in Glasgow, where leading clubs drew large crowds. The Glasgow Junior FA, having seen a number of its proposals rejected at SJFA meetings, seceded from the SJFA in 1907 but returned a year later. Further disputes occurred in 1922 over &quot;poaching&quot; clubs and, in 1927, the GJFA was instrumental in the Intermediate dispute which split the SJFA for four seasons. The record number of clubs to enter the Junior Cup was 412 in 1922–23.

The local associations continued to run their leagues until 1968, when the SJFA instituted major reforms. This first phase of regionalisation removed the need for the many local associations, replacing them instead with six regional committees. These six regions — Ayrshire, Central, East, Fife, Tayside and North — still exist, to a certain extent, as divisions in the national league structure and as operators of certain cup competitions.

The last major league reform took place in 2002, with the six regions &quot;merging&quot; to create a three-pronged regional league setup consisting of East, North, and West regions (see &quot;Organisation and regions&quot;).

Since the 2007–08 season, up to four Junior sides have been able to qualify for the Scottish Cup. The four teams are the three Superleague winners (West, East and North) and the Scottish Junior Cup winners, all from the previous season. In the 2015–16 season, Linlithgow Rose became the first junior team to reach the last 16 of the Scottish Cup after beating Forfar Athletic. (see &quot;Juniors in the Scottish Cup&quot;).

In 2011, the Scottish Football Association created two new operational boards, Professional and Non-Professional, to provide more focused governance in these differing areas of the game. Junior football is represented on the Non-Professional Game Board alongside other organisations such as the East of Scotland Football League, South of Scotland Football League and Scottish Amateur Football Association.

== Name ==
The term &quot;junior&quot; does not relate to the age of players. Football for young players is generally known as &quot;Youth&quot; (up to Under-19) or &quot;Juvenile&quot; (which is to Under-21 level) football. In the late 19th century, membership of the SFA conferred &quot;senior&quot; status on a club and the junior grade developed outside the SFA framework. Today, the senior grade of football in Scotland is played in the Scottish Professional Football League (until 2013 divided into the Scottish Premier League and the Scottish Football League), as well as the six senior non-leagues: the Highland Football League, the Lowland Football League, the North Caledonian League the East of Scotland Football League, the South of Scotland Football League and the West of Scotland Football League. Over time, as various local football associations and leagues — both junior and senior — have risen in strength, or in some cases disappeared completely. Scottish football developed its current pattern with either junior or senior non-leagues taking precedence in various parts of the country with some occasional overlap. Nowadays, membership of the SJFA automatically confers on a club registered membership of the SFA; however, junior and senior non-league clubs still play in separate competitions.

Despite the lesser media coverage the juniors get, many of the club sides are fairly popular, and some of the bigger games (such as the local derbies between Arthurlie and Pollok, and Cumnock Juniors vs. Auchinleck Talbot) can attract attendances in the thousands. Crowds were far bigger in the past (76,000 for the Junior Cup Final in 1951, with nearly 90,000 watching the semi-finals (including a replay) compared to the level of support attracted now.

== Organisation and regions ==
The SJFA has 112 member clubs, comprising: East Region (19 clubs), North Region (33 clubs) in SJFA-administered leagues, as well as 52 West of Scotland League and 8 East of Scotland League teams who have retained their membership or rejoined the SJFA after moving leagues.

Note

 Club with an SFA Licence

=== League structure ===
Currently there are two regional junior league systems: the East Region with a single division and the North Region with two divisions. The top division of each region sits at tier 6 of the Scottish football league system, with a play-off enabling promotion to the Highland League for clubs with an SFA licence.

There was previously a West Region league system which contained 63 clubs at the end of the 2019–20 season, prior to its members leaving the Juniors to join a new West of Scotland Football League in the senior pyramid. 53 of those clubs kept their membership of the SJFA in order to enter the Scottish Junior Cup. A similar move had also greatly reduced the East Region&#x27;s membership two years earlier when 25 clubs joined the East of Scotland Football League ahead of the 2018–19 season, with a further 20 clubs making the move over the next three years.
==== Leagues by period ====

== Cup competitions ==

As well as the local leagues, there are a number of local cup competitions competed for; however, the biggest competition is the Scottish Junior Cup, which every junior club competes for annually, with the final generally held at the end of May. This cup was established in 1886. The final broadcast live on BBC Alba. The cup&#x27;s sponsor for 18 years, until the start of the 2006–07 season, was OVD Demerara Rum, replaced at the semi-final stage of the 2006–07 competition by Scottish coach operator Citylink. Emirates Airlines sponsored the tournament from 2009–2013 and ETHX Energy was the sponsor for 2015–16. The current tournament sponsor is Macron.

==Juniors in the Scottish Cup==
The first attempt by the Scottish Football Association to allow Junior representation in the Scottish Cup was voted down in June 2005. In June 2007 however, the SFA did approve changes to the way that all non-league clubs entered the Scottish Cup. The North and South Qualifying Cups for full and associate member clubs in non-league football, which had both sent their four semi-finalists into the main competition, were scrapped and all these clubs now qualified automatically for the first round. In addition, the winners of the East of Scotland Football League, South of Scotland Football League and top two clubs in the Highland Football League all received a bye to the second round, even if that club was only a registered member of the SFA.

Further to this move, allowing registered member clubs to qualify for the Scottish Cup for the first time, it was announced that the winners of the Scottish Junior Cup, North Superleague, East Superleague and West of Scotland Super League Premier Division would qualify for the first round. This process has continued with the winners of the Scottish Amateur Cup qualifying for the first round from 2015 onwards. Girvan still qualified for the Scottish Cup from 2007 as a result of their historic full membership of the SFA. In 2014, they were joined as annual entrants to the competition by Banks O&#x27; Dee and Linlithgow Rose who achieved the SFA National Club Licensing criteria. Girvan themselves were awarded a National Club License in June 2016.

If a Junior club does a &quot;double&quot; by winning their respective Superleague championship and the Junior Cup, runners-up do not qualify and the Juniors are only represented by three qualifying entrants. This occurred in the 2007–08 Scottish Cup which was the first competition since the changes as Linlithgow Rose had won both league and cup. Rose performed the best of all three Junior qualifiers in this inaugural season, reaching the fourth round before losing to eventual finalists, Queen of the South. Of the other early entrants, Pollok defeated St Cuthbert Wanderers before taking Montrose to a replay in Glasgow, watched by 1,873 spectators. North champions Culter defeated two East of Scotland League clubs before losing to Highland League side Huntly in the third round.

In the 2008–09 competition, Banks O&#x27; Dee achieved the first double figure scoreline by a Junior club, with a 10–0 defeat of Highland League Fort William. This was bettered in the 2016–17 cup by Bonnyrigg Rose Athletic, whose 14–0 defeat of Burntisland Shipyard remains the largest margin of victory by a Junior side in the competition.

Irvine Meadow became the first Junior side to knock out Scottish Football League opposition in 2009, defeating Arbroath in the third round and became the first side to face Premier League opposition when they drew Hibernian in the next round. Linlithgow Rose&#x27;s defeat of Forfar Athletic in the 2015–16 competition saw them become the first Junior side to reach the fifth round. In 2016-17 Bonnyrigg defeated Scottish Championship side Dumbarton away from home in the third Round.

In the intervening years, Junior clubs have had reasonable success with several clubs defeating Scottish Football League opposition. These results are listed below:




== Scotland Junior international team ==

Juniors also play internationally, with the best players being picked to play for the Scottish Junior international team against other countries&#x27; non-league select teams. The Umbro-sponsored Junior International Quadrangular Tournament takes place every two years and is contested between teams from Scotland, the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. The tournament is hosted in turn by each country, with matches taking place at the larger junior grounds in the host country, such as Dunterlie Park, Pollok&#x27;s Newlandsfield and Petershill Park when the tournament was held in Scotland in 2005. The team&#x27;s most capped player is Bert McNab, of Petershill, who won 12 caps between 1951 and 1955.

The team have been led since 2008 by former Glenrothes, Tayport and Kelty manager, Keith Burgess.

=== Team history ===
After the formation of the Scottish Junior Football Association in 1886, officials began to explore opportunities for representative international matches. On receipt of a £17 guarantee, the Lancashire Junior League in England agreed to raise a team, and on 11 May 1889 the first junior international was played at Douglas Park, Hamilton, with Scotland winning 10–1. A return fixture could not be arranged as the Lancashire league could not provide a sufficient guarantee.

On 15 February 1890, Scotland played their first match against Ireland at Hibernian Park, Glasgow. The 11–0 scoreline in the hosts&#x27; favour remains a record victory for the Scottish Junior international team. This fixture did become an annual event, and on 14 February 1891 the team travelled to Belfast for their first away match, a 1–1 draw at Ulsterville, the home of Linfield.

In 1894, games against England resumed with a fixture against Birmingham &amp; District Counties F.A. in Leamington. These games continued until World War II, then were revived for a short period in the 1970s. Scotland suffered a record 5–0 defeat in the 1927 fixture at Molineux, Wolverhampton.
Games against Wales began in 1912 with a fixture against a representative side of the North Wales Coast F.A, the first game taking place in Bangor on 13 April, Scotland winning 2–1.

In 1920, the Scottish Junior international side created history by being the first representative football side from Scotland to undertake a foreign tour. In June, a party of 13 players and three officials visited Norway and played three games each in Stavanger and Bergen. The full Scottish national side did not play a match outwith the British Isles until 1929 when they also travelled to Norway.

A game against the Irish Free State was played on 9 March 1929 in Dublin with Scotland winning 2–1 but regular games against a Republic of Ireland side did not begin until 1947. The first game in this series was played at Dalymount Park, Dublin on 25 May, with Scotland winning 3–2.

In September 1975, the team travelled to Osnabrück, West Germany, to play three matches against a BAOR Select side, winning two of the games.

The number of games against the different home nations has varied in regularity over the years. From 1958 until 1967, Northern Ireland were Scotland&#x27;s only opponents, while in the 1970s there was an eight-year gap between the two sides meeting. Currently, games against England and Wales are in abeyance, and the team contest the biannual Quadrangular Tournament with friendly and testimonial matches arranged intermittently in the intervening seasons.

=== Current squad ===
The following players were selected for the Junior International Quadrangular Tournament which was held in Glasgow, from 11–14 October 2017.

=== Notable players ===
The following list, with one exception, notes players who all went on to gain full international honours for Scotland after winning junior international caps, the junior club with which they played at the time and the year of their junior cap.

Bob Foyers was a member of the team which played the first ever Scotland Junior international fixture in May 1889, and after joining St Bernard&#x27;s the following year, became the first dual Junior/Senior international in 1893 when capped against Wales.

Harry Rennie earned his Junior cap as a defender and signed for Morton as such, but became a goalkeeper aged 23 in 1897 and won ten Senior caps in his new position.

The highest number of players from a Junior international match to go on to win Senior caps is four. In April 1896, Hugh Morgan, Willie Muir, Tommy Low and Bobby Walker, helped Scotland defeat England 4–0 at Aston Villa&#x27;s Wellington Road ground. A further six players from the team also stepped up to Senior football.

The one exception noted on the list is Paul Wilson. The former Celtic forward was capped in 1980 after his Senior career while turning out for Blantyre Celtic, alongside another former Celt and dual international, Jimmy Johnstone.

Two players also received full caps for other nations after playing for Scotland Juniors: Archie Blue for Australia and Tommy O&#x27;Hara for the United States.

\header { tagline = ##f }
scale = \relative c&#x27; { \key c \major \omit Score.TimeSignature

\score { { « \cadenzaOn \scale \context NoteNames \scale » } \layout { } \midi { } }
&lt;/score&gt;

==Compositions==
Twenty of Joseph Haydn&#x27;s 106 symphonies are in C major, making it his second most-used key, second to D major. Of the 134 symphonies mistakenly attributed to Haydn that H. C. Robbins Landon lists in his catalog, 33 are in C major, more than any other key. Before the invention of the valves, Haydn did not write trumpet and timpani parts in his symphonies, except those in C major. Landon writes that it wasn&#x27;t &quot;until 1774 that Haydn uses trumpets and timpani in a key other than C major... and then only sparingly.&quot; Most of Haydn&#x27;s symphonies in C major are labelled &quot;festive&quot; and are of a primarily celebratory mood. Wilfrid Mellers believed that Mozart&#x27;s Symphony No. 41, written in &#x27;white&#x27; C major, &quot;represented the triumph of light&quot;. (See also List of symphonies in C major.)

Many masses and settings of the Te Deum in the Classical era were in C major. Mozart and Haydn wrote most of their masses in C major. Gounod (in a review of Sibelius&#x27; Third Symphony) said that &quot;only God composes in C major&quot;. Six of his own masses are written in C.

Of Franz Schubert&#x27;s two symphonies in the key, the first is nicknamed the &quot;Little C major&quot; and the second the &quot;Great C major&quot;.

Scott Joplin&#x27;s &quot;The Entertainer&quot; is written in C major.

Many musicians have pointed out that every musical key conjures up specific feelings. This idea is further explored in a radio program called &quot;The Signature Series&quot;. American popular songwriter Bob Dylan claimed the key of C major to &quot;be the key of strength, but also the key of regret&quot;. Sibelius&#x27;s Symphony No. 7 is in C major and that key was of great importance in his previous symphonies.

<text>The Biograph Theater on Lincoln Avenue in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois, was originally a movie theater but now presents live productions. It gained early notoriety as the location where bank robber John Dillinger was leaving when he was shot down by FBI agents, after he watched a gangster movie there on July 22, 1934. The theater is on the National Register of Historic Places and was designated a Chicago Landmark on March 28, 2001.

==History==
Designed by architect Samuel N. Crowen in 1914, the Biograph has many of the distinguishing characteristics of movie houses of the period, including a storefront-width lobby, recessed entrance, free-standing ticket booth, and canopy marquee. The building is finished with red pressed brick and white-glazed terra cotta.

On July 22, 1934, after attending the film &quot;Manhattan Melodrama&quot; with brothel madam Ana Cumpănaș, also known as Anna Sage (or &quot;The Woman in Red&quot;), and Polly Hamilton, John Dillinger was shot dead outside the Biograph by FBI agents led by Melvin Purvis, when he attempted to pull a pistol and flee into the crowd after he saw them. Dillinger&#x27;s whereabouts had been leaked to the FBI by Cumpănaș under the threat of deportation back to her birthplace of Romania.

From the 1970s through the 1980s, the Biograph was the center in Chicago for midnight showings, with raucous costumed cult following, of &quot;Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;.

In July 2004, after 90 years as a movie theater under various owners, Chicago&#x27;s Victory Gardens Theater announced it had purchased the Biograph for use as a live venue. The theater was completely renovated by architect Daniel P. Coffey, who constructed a proscenium-thrust stage and seating for 299 people. A grand staircase, which was part of the original structure, was restored to lead up to the building&#x27;s second floor, housing a studio theater seating 135 people and an adjacent rehearsal/multiple-use space. The $11 million project for the new theater, styled the Victory Gardens at the Biograph, was completed in the fall of 2006. The new stage is deep and wide, with of wing space on either side. There is an trap space below the stage. There is limited fly space above the stage. There are two dressing rooms and a green room behind the stage. The lobby is wider than in the movie theater days, and the restrooms have been expanded.
The facades of the theater and adjoining businesses were redressed to appear as they did in 1934 for the 2009 film &quot;Public Enemies&quot;. The theater is also shown in the 2000 film &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, in which the gunfight with Dillinger is erroneously said to have taken place inside the theater.

<text>Richard Verrall (born 1948) is a British Holocaust denier and former deputy chairman of the British National Front (NF) who edited the magazine &quot;Spearhead&quot; from 1976 to 1980. Under the &quot;nom de plume&quot; of Richard E. Harwood, Verrall wrote the pamphlet &quot;Did Six Million Really Die?&quot;

==National Front involvement==
Verrall studied history at Westfield College, now part of Queen Mary University of London, obtaining a first class honours degree. Initially a member of the Conservative Party, Verrall left in the early 1970s, along with a number of members on the right who supported Enoch Powell, to join the NF. Initially a close supporter of John Tyndall, he was appointed &quot;Spearhead&quot; editor by Tyndall and used the magazine to deny the Holocaust. He was also known for his endorsement of eugenics and biological determinism, adding to this theory that it was equally natural for members of a genetic group to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of others of the same group, thus attacking the criticism that the notion of sacrifice makes this theory inapplicable to humanity.

Despite his initial support for Tyndall, Verrall did not follow him into the New National Front and indeed was appointed deputy chairman of the NF by Andrew Brons in 1980. In 1985, he testified before a British court that he was disassociated from the NF, testimony that was corroborated by that of his Canadian publisher in a separate trial held in Ontario.

==Holocaust denial career==
Verrall is best known for his pamphlet (under the pseudonym Richard Harwood), &quot;Did Six Million Really Die?&quot;, a Holocaust denial pamphlet which was the subject of criminal action against its Canadian-based German publisher, Ernst Zündel. The Supreme Court of Canada found the pamphlet contained fabrications and distortions, noting it &quot;misrepresented the work of historians, misquoted witnesses, fabricated evidence, and cited non-existent authorities&quot;.

In 2017, Amazon in the UK removed the pamphlet from its site.

==Personal life==
Verrall married Tessa Sempik, a British solicitor. They were mentioned in a 1996 article about tenancy law.

<doc id="421418" wikidata="Q1131736" url="?curid=421418" title="The Pied Pipers">
<text>The Pied Pipers are an American popular singing group originally formed in the late 1930s. They had several chart hits throughout the 1940s, both under their own name and in association with Tommy Dorsey, with Johnny Mercer and with Frank Sinatra.

==Origins==
Originally, the group consisted of eight members who had belonged to three separate groups: Jo Stafford from The Stafford Sisters, and seven male singers: John Huddleston, Hal Hopper, Chuck Lowry, Bud Hervey, George Tait, Woody Newbury, and Dick Whittinghill, who had belonged to two groups named The Four Esquires and The Three Rhythm Kings, all of whom were contributing to the 1938 movie &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;. Multi-instrumentalist Spencer Clark was also a member at one point.

Paul Weston and Axel Stordahl, who were arrangers for Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s big band, heard of the group through two of The King Sisters, Alyce and Yvonne. Weston had a jam session at his home and a visiting advertising executive signed the octet for Dorsey&#x27;s radio program, broadcast in New York City. They sang with Dorsey&#x27;s orchestra for about six weeks before a British representative of the sponsor objected to some of the songs in their repertoire and fired them. They went back to California, but in the time they had been in New York had recorded two records for RCA Victor Records.

==Chicago quartet==
While in Los Angeles, the group was reduced to a quartet: Jo Stafford, her then-husband John Huddleston, and Chuck Lowry from the original eight, and Billy Wilson. They were getting little work, however, and were on the threshold of disbanding when they received a call from Tommy Dorsey (in Chicago). Dorsey said he could not afford to hire eight Pipers but would be happy to have them join him if they could cut the number down to a quartet. As they had already done that, and with only one unemployment check remaining, they were happy to comply.

In 1939, they moved to Chicago, with Clark Yocum, who had played guitar and sung for Dorsey, replacing Wilson. Although Paul Weston left Dorsey to become Dinah Shore&#x27;s music director about that time, he was to figure in the fortunes of the group again.

In 1940, Dorsey hired another vocalist, Frank Sinatra, who had previously sung in a quartet, The Hoboken Four, and later with Harry James&#x27; orchestra. Sinatra and the Pipers teamed to record a major hit, &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Smile Again&quot;, in that year. The group had twelve more chart hits with Dorsey, ten of them with Sinatra. Also, Jo Stafford herself had a solo hit, &quot;Yes Indeed&quot;, in 1941.

==Los Angeles years==
Around Thanksgiving 1942, Tommy Dorsey (who was prone to incidents of bad temper) became angry at one of the Pipers for sending him in the wrong direction at a railroad station in Portland, Oregon, and fired him. The Pipers, out of &quot;team loyalty,&quot; resigned &quot;en masse&quot;. At that moment, the No. 1 record on the charts was &quot;There Are Such Things&quot; sung by Frank Sinatra and the Pied Pipers, the last RCA record they did with Dorsey.

They returned to Los Angeles and signed with Capitol Records, where Paul Weston was now working, and he became the arranger and orchestra leader for most of the Pipers&#x27; recordings. Huddleston left to join the war effort (he was divorced from Stafford around that time), and Hal Hopper rejoined the group to replace him. The group also backed Johnny Mercer on a number of sides. In 1944 Jo Stafford had a hit on her own, ahead of the Pipers, and after a couple more hits, she left for good to pursue a solo career. She was replaced in May by June Hutton, who had been singing with the Stardusters.

The Pipers had twelve charted hit singles on Capitol, including &quot;Dream&quot; and ending with &quot;My Happiness&quot; (biggest hit version by Jon and Sondra Steele, later made popular again by Connie Francis) in 1948. They also continued a relationship with Frank Sinatra, doing several tours with him starting in 1945 and becoming a regular on his radio program from 1945 to 1947.

==Radio==
In 1944, The Pied Pipers were regulars on &quot;Johnny Mercer&#x27;s Chesterfield Music Shop&quot; on the NBC Radio Network Monday through Friday nights.
Beginning March 30, 1948, the group became a part of &quot;Club Fifteen&quot; on CBS. They sang on the program&#x27;s Tuesday and Thursday episodes, alternating with The Andrews Sisters, who sang on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

==Modern era==

In 1950, June Hutton left the group and was replaced by Sue Allen and later by Virginia Marcy. (However, the trade publication
&quot;Billboard&quot; reported that Virginia Maxie replaced Hutton in December 1949.) Hutton married Axel Stordahl, the other half of Dorsey&#x27;s original arranging team. Just as Jo Stafford (who had married Paul Weston) had her husband&#x27;s orchestra accompany her on her solo hits, June Hutton&#x27;s solo hits on Capitol in the 1950s featured Stordahl&#x27;s orchestra as backing group.

Louanne Hogan, who was the dubbed singing voice behind several movie stars, was briefly a member of The Pied Pipers in 1951. Lee Gotch, who had sung in the 1940s with the swing group Six Hits and a Miss, joined the Pied Pipers from 1954 to 1967, during which time he recorded an LP by Lee Gotch&#x27;s Ivy Barflies. The Pied Pipers appeared on the December 12, 1955 episode &#x27;Ricky&#x27;s European Booking&#x27; on TV&#x27;s &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. 

The Pied Pipers sang on a few tracks of Frank Sinatra&#x27;s 1950s studio albums, backed up Sam Cooke on his No. 1 hit, &quot;You Send Me&quot;, and made a guest appearance on &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;.

===Current===
The current Pied Pipers are Nancy Knorr, Don Lucas, Kevin Kennard, Chris Sanders, and David Zack. The group frequently performs with the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra.

==Recognition==
In both 1944 and 1945, The Pied Pipers won awards from &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine as the best and most popular group of the year. The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001.

==Recordings==
The group was one of the early artists to return to recording at the end of the American Federation of Musicians&#x27; recording ban. Under the musical leadership of Johnny Mercer and Paul Weston the Pied Piper recorded singles and albums for Capitol Records in the mid and latter 1940s.

In the 1950s they recorded for Tops Records. In the 1960s they recorded for Warner Bros. Records and other companies.

The contract to build &quot;Archerfish&quot; was awarded on 25 June 1968 and her keel was laid down on 19 June 1969 at Groton, Connecticut, by the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation. She was launched on 16 January 1971, sponsored by Miss Mary Conover Warner, and commissioned at her home port, New London, Connecticut, on 17 December 1971.

==Service history==

===1971–1972===
Following her commissioning, &quot;Archerfish&quot; proceeded to Newport, Rhode Island, in late January 1972 and then to the Caribbean Sea for shakedown training. She held acoustic sea trials in Exuma Sound in the Bahama Islands and weapons systems acceptance trials at Roosevelt Roads off Puerto Rico, and at St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands. She carried out tests off the Bahamas in April and May 1972.

From 5 to 15 June 1972, &quot;Archerfish&quot; participated in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Exercise &quot;Pink Lace&quot; in the mid-Atlantic Ocean. In August 1972, she took part in Antisubmarine Warfare Exercise 1–73. On 5 September 1972, she began post-shakedown repairs and alterations in the Electric Boat Division shipyard at Groton, where she received extensive modifications and new equipment. She left the shipyard on 26 October and spent the rest of 1972 in local operations and preparation for her first overseas deployment.

===1973===
On 6 January 1973, &quot;Archerfish&quot; left Groton and shaped a course for the Mediterranean Sea. During her deployment there, she conducted two special operations and visited Rota, Spain, and Naples, Italy. Her deployment concluded with her arrival at Naval Submarine Base New London, Connecticut, on 19 June 1973.

&quot;Archerfish&quot; got underway again in August 1973, bound for the Bahama Islands to participate in Atlantic Submarine Exercise KILO 1–74. She provided services in support of a special project under the direction of the Chief of Naval Operations in the western Atlantic Ocean during the last half of September 1973. She then traveled to a testing range off the Bahamas, held torpedo certification trials, and arrived at New London on 12 October 1973 for extensive training in preparation for her second overseas deployment.

===1974===
&quot;Archerfish&quot; left New London on 7 January 1974 for special operations in the North Atlantic Ocean. During this cruise, she visited Faslane Naval Base, Scotland, before returning to New London on 8 March 1974. Following upkeep, she voyaged to the Narragansett Bay in early May 1974 to carry out sonar evaluation projects. On 27 May 1974, she proceeded to Port Everglades, Florida, for further testing. She then continued on to the Caribbean to take part in Atlantic Submarine Exercise KILO 2–74 near the Bahamas. On 10 June 1974, &quot;Archerfish&quot; arrived at New London and began testing and evaluating new sonar equipment.

&quot;Archerfish&quot; departed New London for the Bahamas once again on 9 September 1974 to participate in Atlantic Submarine Exercise KILO 1–75. Upon its completion she took part in naval mine testing near Port Everglades. She returned to the Caribbean on 30 October 1974 for torpedo proficiency firings. From 5 to 18 November 1974, she participated in Submarine Antisubmarine Warfare Exercise 1–75 and then returned to New London for a period of leave and upkeep.

===1975===
In February and March 1975, &quot;Archerfish&quot; carried out special operations in the western Atlantic Ocean. She then took part in Operation Agate Punch, which involved the development and utilization of tactics in direct support of other ships of the United States Atlantic Fleet, from 14 to 28 April 1975. During the summer months of 1975, &quot;Archerfish&quot; carried out a deployment in the western Atlantic Ocean, which also included a port call at Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. In November and December 1975, she was involved in two additional tactical development exercises, RANGEX 2–76 and SECEX 3–75. She also conducted torpedo tests.

===1976===
After a period of holiday leave and upkeep and the end of 1975 and beginning of 1976, &quot;Archerfish&quot; took part in Submarine Antisubmarine Warfare Exercise 1–76 in February 1976 before commencing a deployment to the North Atlantic Ocean in March 1976. During April and May 1976, she carried out independent operations and returned to New London in June. She then moved to Portsmouth, Virginia, where she began at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 7 July 1976.

===1977–1979===
During her post-overhaul sea trials in May 1977, &quot;Archerfish&quot;″s home port was changed from New London to Naval Station Norfolk at Norfolk, Virginia, on 12 May 1977. &quot;Archerfish&quot; began post-overhaul shakedown on 8 June 1977. She held torpedo proficiency firings and made port visits at Port Everglades and Port Canaveral, Florida. She returned to Norfolk on 8 July 1977 and began upkeep.

&quot;Archerfish&quot; got underway again on 21 August 1977 for a cruise during which she hosted a class of prospective commanding officers. She also carried out torpedo tests and made a stop at Port Everglades. &quot;Archerfish&quot; arrived at Norfolk on 6 September 1977, but quickly put to sea again on 12 September, bound for the West Indies to conduct torpedo test firings off the Bahamas and to perform special sonar tests in the Atlantic Ocean.

Upon returning to Norfolk on 28 September 1977, &quot;Archerfish&quot; began preparations for an overseas deployment in the Mediterranean. She left Norfolk on 12 December 1977 crossed the Atlantic, spent the Christmas holidays in port at Lisbon, Portugal, and entered the Mediterranean Sea on 28 December 1977. While operating with the United States Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean, she participated in Chief of Naval Operation Project &quot;Over the Horizon Testing&quot; and, during March 1978 took part in Exercise &quot;Dogfish.&quot; She concluded her deployment with her arrival at Norfolk in May 1978.

Between 2 July and 4 August 1978, &quot;Archerfish&quot; conducted a midshipman training cruise on 23 August 1978 and began participation in Exercise Northern Wedding, a NATO exercise that occupied her through 8 October 1978. She then returned to Norfolk for leave and upkeep followed by preparations for cold-weather drills in early 1979. &quot;Archerfish&quot; got underway for the Arctic on 14 March 1979. During her cruise there she traveled over under the polar ice cap and surfaced through it 23 times, once at the North Pole. &quot;Archerfish&quot; arrived in Plymouth, England, on 11 May 1979 for a six-day visit and then proceeded to Zeebrugge, Belgium. She left Belgium on 21 May 1979 bound for New London, which had once again become her home port, on 5 June 1979.

In mid-July 1979, &quot;Archerfish&quot; entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, for a repairs and alterations. She got underway again on 3 October 1979 and headed to the West Indies for acoustic trials and weapons testing. She arrived at New London on 21 November 1979 and ended the year there in upkeep.

===1980===
On 23 January 1980, &quot;Archerfish&quot; got underway to take part in RANGEX 1–80, a multi-ship antisubmarine warfare exercise held in the Atlantic Ocean. She returned to New London on 10 February 1980 and remained there until proceeding to Hampton Roads, Virginia, in mid-March 1980 to enter the Newport News Shipbuilding shipyard at Newport News, Virginia, for the replacement of a sonar dome. That work was completed on 1 April 1980, and &quot;Archerfish&quot; returned to New London to prepare for another deployment.

On 23 May 1980, &quot;Archerfish&quot; left New London for the North Atlantic Ocean to conduct special operations. During the cruise, she made port calls in Norway and West Germany before returning to New London on 25 August 1980.

&quot;Archerfish&quot; returned to the West Indies in mid-October 1980 for torpedo testing off the Bahamas. She paused at Norfolk for deperming before returning to New London on 30 October 1980. She got underway on 17 November 1980 to take part in Atlantic Antisubmarine Warfare Exercise 2–81. Upon completing the exercise on 26 November 1980, she returned to New London to begin a series of inspections.

===1981–1986===
&quot;Archerfish&quot; continued operations from New London into early 1981. During 1981 and 1982, she alternated two spring deployments to the Mediterranean Sea with normal operations out of New London during the autumn and winter. In February 1983, she began a regular overhaul at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine. The extended repair period lasted until October 1984 at which time she resumed duty out of New London, Connecticut. Those operations included a North Atlantic deployment in 1985 and a deployment to the polar icecap in 1986, where she met up with USS Hawkbill (SSN-666) and USS Ray (SSN-653) to join in the first tri-submarine surfacing at the North Pole.

===1987–1998===

Archerfish continued local operations until summer 1987, when she was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea. Her next major deployment was in 1988 when she participated in under ice operations at the North Pole. In September 1988, Archerfish sailed to Puget Sound, Washington where she was drydocked and overhauled. Here she was fitted with a Dry Deck Shelter. After overhaul she did four Mediterranean Sea deployments from 1992 to 1997.

==Decommissioning and disposal==

&quot;Archerfish&quot; was decommissioned on 31 March 1998 and struck from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the U.S. Navy″s Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 6 November 1998.
