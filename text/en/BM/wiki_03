<text>Vladimir Semyonovich Vysotsky (25 January 193825 July 1980) was a Soviet singer-songwriter, poet, and actor who had an immense and enduring effect on Soviet culture. He became widely known for his unique singing style and for his lyrics, which featured social and political commentary in often-humorous street jargon. He was also a prominent stage- and screen-actor. Though the official Soviet cultural establishment largely ignored his work, he was remarkably popular during his lifetime and has exerted significant influence on many of Russia&#x27;s musicians and actors.

== Early life ==
Vysotsky was born on 25 January 1938, at the 3rd Meshchanskaya Street (61/2) maternity hospital in Moscow. His father was Semyon Vladimirovich (Volfovich) Vysotsky, a Jewish man who came originally from Kiev. His mother, Nina Maksimovna Vysotsky (née Seryogina), was Russian, and worked as a German translator. The family lived in a communal flat at No. 126, 1st Meshchanskaya Street.

Vladimir&#x27;s theatrical inclinations became obvious at an early age, and were supported by his mother, herself a great fan of theatre. Vysotsky later recalled: &quot;I didn&#x27;t have anyone in my family who was an actor or a director [...] nobody who was in the arts. But my mother really loved theatre, and every Saturday—from the very earliest age until I was about thirteen or fourteen—she would take me to the theatre. And that probably stuck.&quot; His paternal grandmother Dora Bronshteyn also supported his interests. The boy used to recite poems, standing on a chair and &quot;flinging hair backwards, like a real poet,&quot; and often used expressions he could hardly have heard at home. Once, at the age of two, when he had tired of the family&#x27;s guests&#x27; poetry requests, he, according to his mother, sat himself under the New Year tree with a frustrated air about him and sighed: &quot;You freeloaders, let the child rest!&quot; His sense of humor was extraordinary, but often baffling for people around him. At three years old he would jeer at his father while the latter was in the bathroom, breaking out unexpected poetic improvisation (&quot;Take a look what&#x27;s happening here! / Our goat&#x27;s decided to shave!&quot;) or appall unwanted guests with street folk songs. Vysotsky remembered these earliest years of his life in the autobiographical song &quot;Ballada detstva&quot; (&quot;Ballad of Childhood&quot;).

After the outbreak of World War II, Semyon Vysotsky, who had been a reserve officer, was called up for service in the Red Army. In March 1941 he was sent to the front. Nina and Vladimir were evacuated to the village of Vorontsovka in Orenburg Oblast, where the boy had to spend six days a week at kindergarten while his mother worked twelve hours a day in a chemical factory. In 1943, both returned to their flat in Moscow. In September 1945, Vladimir entered the first grade at the 273rd Moscow Rostokino District School.

In December 1946, Vysotsky&#x27;s parents divorced. From 1947 to 1949, Vladimir lived with Semyon Vladimirovich (then an army Major) and his Armenian wife, Yevgenya Stepanovna Liholatova, whom the boy called &quot;Aunt Zhenya,&quot; at a military base in Eberswalde in the Soviet occupation zone in Germany. &quot;We decided that our son would stay with me. Vladimir came to stay with me in January 1947, and my second wife, Yevgenia, became Vladimir&#x27;s second mother for many years to come. They had much in common and liked each other, which made me really happy,&quot; Semyon Vysotsky later remembered. Here the living conditions were much better than at Nina&#x27;s communal flat in Moscow; the family occupied the whole floor of a two-story house, and for the first time in his life Vladimir had a room to himself. In 1949, Vladimir and his stepmother returned to Moscow. There he joined the fifth grade of the 128th School of Moscow and settled at 15 , where they had two rooms of a four-room communal flat to themselves. Vysotsky found &quot;Auntie Zhenya,&quot; who was just 28 at the time, to be a woman of great kindness and warmth, and later remembered as her as being a second mother to him.

In 1953 Vysotsky, by this point very interested in theater and cinema, enrolled in drama courses led by Vladimir Bogomolov. That same year he received his first-ever guitar, as a birthday present from his mother. His close friend Igor Kokhanovsky, who would go on to become a well-known Soviet pop lyricist, taught him basic chords. In 1955 Vladimir moved into his mother&#x27;s new home at No. 76, 1st Meshchanskaya, and in June of that year he graduated from school with five A&#x27;s.

== Career ==

=== 1955-1963: Beginnings in theatre, cinema, and music ===
In 1955, Vladimir enrolled into the Moscow State University of Civil Engineering, but dropped out after just one year to pursue an acting career. In June 1956 he joined Boris Vershilov&#x27;s class at the Moscow Art Theatre School. There he met the third-year student Iza Zhukova, who four years later would become his wife. The two soon settled in a common room at the Meschanskaya flat, where their space was sectioned off by a folding screen. It was also at the MAT School that Vysotsky met Bulat Okudzhava, who at this point was already a popular underground bard. He was even more impressed by his Russian literature teacher, Andrey Sinyavsky, who often invited students to his home to stage improvised disputes and concerts. 

In 1958, Vysotsky got his first role at the Moscow Art Theatre: that of Porfiry Petrovich in &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;. 

In 1959 he was cast in his first cinema role, that of the student Petya in &quot;Female Age-Mates&quot;. 

On 20 June 1960, Vysotsky graduated from the MAT School. He soon joined the Moscow Pushkin Drama Theatre, then led by Boris Ravenskikh, where he spent almost three troubled years (with intervals). His time at the theatre was marred by numerous administrative sanctions for &quot;lack of discipline&quot; and occasional drunken sprees, which were primarily a reaction to the lack of serious roles and his inability to realize his artistic potential.

In 1961 and 1962 Vysotsky appeared in the films &quot;Dima Gorin&#x27;s Career&quot; and &quot;713 Requests Permission to Land&quot;, respectively. Both roles required him to be beaten up on screen, in the first case by Aleksandr Demyanenko. &quot;That was the way cinema greeted me,&quot; Vysotsky joked later.

In 1961 Vysotsky also wrote his first proper song, called &quot;Tatuirovka&quot; (&quot;Tattoo&quot;), starting a long and colorful cycle of artfully stylized criminal underworld romantic stories, full of undercurrents and witty social comments.

In 1962 he did a short stint at the Moscow Theater of Miniatures, then directed by Vladimir Polyakov, which ended with his being fired. The official reason given was &quot;for total lack of а sense of humour.&quot;

In June 1963, while shooting &quot;Penalty Kick&quot; (dir. Veniamin Dorman) Vysotsky used the Gorky Film Studio to record an hour-long reel-to-reel cassette of his own songs. Copies of it quickly spread, and Vysotsky&#x27;s name became known in Moscow and elsewhere, though many of the songs were referred to as being either folk music or anonymous. Only several months later, chess grandmaster Mikhail Tal was heard praising the author of &quot;Bolshoy Karetny,&quot; and Anna Akhmatova (in conversation with Joseph Brodsky) quoted from Vysotsky&#x27;s &quot;Ya byl dushoj durnogo obshhestva&quot; (&quot;I Was the Soul of a Bad Company&quot;), apparently taking it for a brilliant piece of anonymous street folklore.

=== 1964–1970: Taganka Theatre, rise to fame, and backlash ===
====Taganka Theatre and early work====

In 1964 Vysotsky auditioned at the Taganka Theatre. Yuri Lyubimov, the theatre&#x27;s director, recalled the audition many years later: &quot;A young man came to my theatre. When I asked him what role he wanted to read for, he answered, &#x27;I&#x27;ve written some songs of my own. Won&#x27;t you listen?&#x27; I agreed to listen to one song […] Our meeting should have lasted at most five minutes. But I ended up listening without interruption for an hour and a half.&quot; Vysotsky was invited to join, and on 19 September 1964 he debuted in Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Good Person of Szechwan&quot; as the Second God. Later that year he appeared on stage as a dragoon captain (Bela&#x27;s father) in an adaptation of &quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot;.

Outside of the theater, in October 1964 Vysotsky recorded 48 of his songs in chronological order, creating his first &quot;The Complete Works of...&quot; compilation. This boosted his popularity as a new Moscow folk underground star.

It was at Taganka Theatre that Vysotsky first started to sing on stage. In January 1965 he appeared in the avant-garde production &quot;The Poet and the Theater&quot;, which combined the poetry of Andrey Voznesensky with sketches and music, and received his first-ever songwriting credit for his contributions. That same month he also appeared in &quot;Ten Days That Shook the World&quot;, again contributing music and lyrics. In April 1965 Vysotsky also debuted as a solo musical performer, holding two live concerts at the Leningrad Nuclear Physics Institute. He then wrote multiple songs for, and appeared in, Yuri Lyubimov&#x27;s World War II play &quot;The Fallen and the Living&quot;, which premiered at Taganka Theatre in October 1965. Vysotsky&#x27;s musical contributions included &quot;Zvezdy&quot; (&quot;Stars&quot;), &quot;Soldaty gruppy Tsentr&quot; (&quot;Center Group Soldiers&quot;), and &quot;Shtrafniye batalyony&quot; (&quot;Penal Battalions&quot;), all striking examples of a completely new kind of war song. 

On 17 May 1966 Vysotsky appeared in his first leading theater role, Galileo in Lyubimov&#x27;s production of &quot;Life of Galileo&quot;. The role required Vysotsky to perform numerous acrobatic tricks on stage. Press reaction was mixed, with some reviewers stating they disliked Vysotsky&#x27;s overt emotionalism, but for the first time his name appeared in Soviet papers. 

Around this time Vysotsky also landed his first &quot;serious&quot; (neither comical nor villainous) film role, appearing as Volodya in Viktor Turov&#x27;s &quot;I Come From Childhood&quot; (1966). The film featured two of his songs, &quot;Holoda&quot; (&quot;The Cold&quot;) and &quot;Bratskie mogily&quot; (&quot;Mass Graves&quot;), the latter sung for the film by Mark Bernes.

====Breakthrough role and rise to fame====
Vysotsky&#x27;s major breakthrough came with his starring role in the mountain climbing drama &quot;Vertical&quot; (1967), which prominently featured his songs. Mostly written during filming on Mount Elbrus, these included &quot;Pesnya o druge&quot; (&quot;Song About a Friend&quot;) and &quot;Voyennaya pesnya&quot; (&quot;War Song&quot;). Due to widely-circulated amateur recordings of his live performances, the songs were already widely-known by the time the film premiered. When the film was released, Vysotsky skyrocketed to fame. In January of 1968, thanks to the efforts of producer Anna Kachalina (Chief Variety Editor for the record label Melodiya) and permission from the head of Melodiya, music was from the film was released on vinyl. The initial pressing sold out immediately, and record stores placed further orders directly to record factories without Melodiya&#x27;s authorization.

In 1967 Vysotsky also starred in Kira Muratova&#x27;s &quot;Brief Encounters&quot;, which featured another off-the-cuff musical piece, this time the melancholy &quot;Dela&quot; (&quot;Things to Do&quot;). Vysotsky also continued his work at Taganka Theatre, taking the role of Mayakovsky in the experimental play &quot;Listen!&quot; and holding regular semi-official concerts where audiences greeted him as a cult hero.

At the end of 1967 Vysotsky landed another pivotal theater role, that of in &quot;Pugachev&quot;, based on Sergei Yesenin&#x27;s poem &quot;Land of Scoundrels&quot;. The play is often described as one of Taganka&#x27;s finest. Several weeks after the premiere, infuriated by the actor&#x27;s increasing unreliability due to worsening drinking problems, Lyubimov fired him—only to invite him back several months later. This began a cycle of Vysotsky being sacked and then pardoned which would continue for years.

Marina Vlady, describing Vysotsky&#x27;s popularity during this period, recalled going for a walk on a summer night and hearing his distinctive singing voice from literally every open window.

At least four of Vysotsky&#x27;s 1968 songs, &quot;Spasitye nashi dushi&quot; (&quot;Save Our Souls&quot;), &quot;Ohota na volkov&quot; (&quot;The Wolfhunt&quot;), &quot;Variatszyi na tsiganskiye temy&quot; (&quot;Gypsy Variations&quot;), and &quot;Ban&#x27;ka po belomu&quot; (&quot;Steam-bath in White&quot;) were later hailed as masterpieces.

====Official backlash====

In June 1968 a smear campaign was launched against Vysotsky in the Soviet press. First, &quot;Sovetskaya Rossiya&quot; commented on the &quot;epidemic spread of immoral, smutty songs,&quot; allegedly promoting &quot;criminal world values, alcoholism, vice and immorality,&quot; and condemned their author for &quot;sowing seeds of evil.&quot; Then &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot; linked Vysotsky with black market dealers selling his tapes in Siberia. Composer Dmitry Kabalevsky, speaking at a conference of the Union of Soviet Composers, criticized Soviet radio for giving an ideologically dubious, &quot;low-life product&quot; like &quot;Song for a Friend&quot; unwarranted airplay. Playwright Alexander Stein, who had used several of Vysotsky&#x27;s songs in his play &quot;Last Parade&quot;, was chastised by a Ministry of Culture official for &quot;providing a platform for this anti-Soviet scum.&quot; The phraseology prompted commentators in the West to draw parallels between Vysotsky and Mikhail Zoschenko, another Soviet author who had been officially labeled &quot;scum&quot; some 20 years prior.

Two of Vysotsky&#x27;s 1968 films, Gennadi Poloka&#x27;s &quot;Intervention&quot; (in which he was cast as a dodgy if highly artistic character) and Yevgeny Karelov&#x27;s &quot;Two Comrades Were Serving&quot; (in which he played a gun-toting White Army officer who in the course of the film shoots his friend, his horse, the protagonist, and, finally, himself) were severely censored, the former shelved for almost twenty years.

In 1969 Vysotsky starred in two films: &quot;Master of the Taiga&quot;, where he played a villainous, timber-floating Siberian labour-brigade foreman, and Georgi Yungvald-Khilkevich&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous Tour&quot;. The latter was criticized in the Soviet press for taking a farcical approach to the subject of the Bolshevik underground activities, though it was well-received by the broader Soviet audience.

====Concert tour in Soviet Central Asia ====

In 1970, after visiting the dislodged Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev at his dacha and having a lengthy conversation with him, Vysotsky embarked on a massive and, by Soviet standards, dangerously commercial concert tour in Soviet Central Asia.

=== 1971–1973 ===
In 1971 a drinking spree-related nervous breakdown sent Vysotsky to the . Many of his songs from this period deal with alcoholism and insanity. After a partial recovery (owed largely to the supportive presence of Marina Vlady) Vysotsky embarked on a successful Ukrainian concert tour, and wrote a cluster of new songs. 

On 29 November 1971 Lyubimov&#x27;s version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; premiered at Taganka Theatre, a groundbreaking production with Vysotsky in the leading role—in this incarnation a lone intellectual rebel, rising to fight the cruel state machine.

Also in 1971 Vysotsky was invited to play the lead in &quot;The Sannikov Land&quot;, the screen adaptation of Vladimir Obruchev&#x27;s science fiction novel. He wrote several songs for it, but was dropped at the behest of the General Director of Mosfilm, Nikolai Sizov, ostensibly for being too recognizable as a popular figure. One of the songs written for the film, the doom-laden epic allegory &quot;Koni priveredlivye&quot; (&quot;Picky Horses&quot;) became one of Vysotsky&#x27;s signature tunes.

In 1972 Vysotsky starred in &quot;The Fourth&quot;. He also appeared on Soviet Estonian TV (Eesti Televisioon) for an episode entitled &quot;Noormees Tagankalt&quot; (Young Man from Taganka), in which he performed his songs and gave an interview.

Songs written by Vysotsky in 1972 included &quot;Pevetz u mikrofona&quot; (&quot;Singer at the Microphone&quot;), &quot;Kanatohodetz&quot; (&quot;The Tightrope Walker&quot;), &quot;My vrashaem zemlyu&quot; (&quot;We Turn the Earth&quot;), &quot;Cherniye bushlaty&quot; (&quot;Black Pea-Coats&quot;), &quot;Beda&quot; (&quot;Disaster&quot;), &quot;Zhertva televidinya&quot; (&quot;Victim of Television&quot;), &quot;Chest&#x27; shashmatnoj korony&quot; (&quot;Honor of the Chess Crown&quot;), and &quot;Mishka Shifman.&quot;

In April 1973 Vysotsky visited Poland and France. Difficulties with getting travel permits were resolved after French Communist Party leader Georges Marchais made a personal phone call to Leonid Brezhnev, who, according to Marina Vlady&#x27;s memoirs, rather sympathized with the celebrity couple. Upon their return, Vysotsky discovered that a lawsuit had been brought against him regarding unsanctioned concerts in Siberia the year before. In response, he wrote a defiant letter to the Minister of Culture, Pyotr Demichev. As a result, he was granted the status of a philharmonic artist, guaranteed a payment of 11.5 roubles per concert. Nonetheless, the court found that Vysotsky had to pay a fine of 900 rubles (a substantial sum, given that his monthly salary at Taganka Theatre was 110 rubles).

In 1973 Vysotsky also starred alongside Oleg Dahl in &quot;Bad Good Man&quot;, playing the role of von Koren. His performance earned him the award of &quot;Best Actor in a Male Role&quot; at the 5th Festival of Nations competition at the Taormina Film Fest in Italy.

That same year Vysotsky wrote some thirty songs for &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, an audio play in which he also voiced several minor roles. His best-known songs from 1973 include &quot;Chuzhaya koleya&quot; (&quot;Someone Else&#x27;s Rut&quot;), &quot;Prervannyj polet&quot; (&quot;Interrupted Flight&quot;), and &quot;Pamyatnik&quot; (&quot;Monument&quot;).

=== 1974–1977 ===
In 1974 Melodiya released a 7-inch EP featuring four of Vysotsky&#x27;s war songs: &quot;On ne vernulsya iz boya&quot; (&quot;He Didn&#x27;t Return From Battle&quot;), &quot;Pesnya o novom vremeni&quot; (&quot;Song About New Times&quot;), &quot;Bratskiye mogily&quot; (&quot;Mass Graves&quot;), and &quot;Pesnya o zemle&quot; (&quot;Song About the Earth&quot;). This represented only a tiny portion of his creative work, by this point owned by millions on tape. 

In September 1974 Vysotsky received his first state award, an Honorary Diploma of the Uzbek SSR, following a tour of the Taganka Theatre in Uzbekistan. Also in 1974 he filmed in &quot;The Only Road&quot;, a joint venture between Mosfilm and the Yugoslav Filmski Studio.

In 1975 Vysotsky was granted membership in the Cinematographers Union of the USSR. This meant he was no longer &quot;anti-Soviet scum,&quot; but rather an unlikely link between the state-sanctioned Soviet cinema elite and the &quot;progressive-thinking artists of the West.&quot; More films followed, among them the science fiction movie &quot;The Flight of Mr. McKinley&quot; (1975). Of the nine ballads he wrote for the film, only two made it into the soundtrack.

This period was the height of Vysotsky&#x27;s popularity. Songs he wrote at the time included &quot;Instruktziya pered poyezdkoj zarubezh&quot; (&quot;Instructions Before a Trip Abroad&quot;) and &quot;Pesnya o pogibshem letchike&quot; (&quot;Song About a Fallen Pilot&quot;).

Also in 1975 Vysotsky made his third trip to France, where he took the risk of visiting his former tutor, Andrey Sinyavsky, by then a celebrated dissident émigré. Vysotsky also became friends with the Paris-based artist Mikhail Shemyakin, with whom he would often drink. Shemyakin recorded Vysotsky in his home studio. Subsequently, after a brief stay in England, Vysotsky traveled to Mexico and in April performed his first concerts there.

During this time there were changes at Taganka Theatre. Lyubimov took a contract job with La Scala in Milan, and was replaced by Anatoly Efros, who had a radically different directorial approach. Efros put on &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, which premiered on 30 June 1975 and starred Alla Demidova (as Ranevskaya) and Vysotsky (as Lopakhin). The play caused a sensation, with critics praising the powerful interplay between Demidova and Vysotksy. Lyubimov, who disliked the piece, accused Efros of giving his actors &quot;stardom malaise.&quot;

The 1976 Taganka Theatre made a visit to Bulgaria, where Vysotsky filmed an interview and recorded 15 songs for the Balkanton record label. When the troupe returned to Moscow, Lyubimov (by then back from Milan) declared himself unable to work with Vysotsky any longer and gave the role of Hamlet to Valery Zolotukhin, Vysotsky&#x27;s best friend. Reportedly, this was when the stressed-out Vysotsky started taking amphetamines.

Songs written by Vysotsky in 1976 included &quot;Kupola&quot; (&quot;Cupolas&quot;) and &quot;Ballada o Lyubvi&quot; (&quot;Ballad of Love&quot;). 

After another trip to Belorussia, Vysotsky and Vlady traveled to France and from there to North America, without requesting or receiving official permission to leave the Soviet Union. 

In North America Vysotsky stopped in New York City, where he met Mikhail Baryshnikov and Joseph Brodsky. He also recorded a segment for &quot;60 Minutes&quot; with Dan Rather, which aired on 20 February 1977. The program incorrectly stated he had served time in a labor camp and presented him as a dissident, though Vysotsky stressed during his interview that he loved his country and did not want to do it any harm. The unauthorized venture bore no repercussions at home, as by this time Soviet authorities were divided on Vysotsky up to the highest level: while Mikhail Suslov detested the bard, Brezhnev loved his work so much that when Brezhnev was in the hospital he asked Vysotsky to perform at the home of his daughter Galina so that he could listen over the telephone.

During this trip Vysotsky also visited Canada, where he recorded an LP with RCA Victor, backed by an orchestra. The resulting record was released in Paris in 1977 under the title &quot;Vladimir Vissotsky&quot; and contained eleven songs.

In September 1976 Vysotsky accompanied the rest of the Taganka Theatre troupe to Yugoslavia, where &quot;Hamlet&quot; won first prize at the annual BITEF festival. He then traveled to Hungary for a two-week concert tour. Once back in Moscow, he played the modest role of Ivan Bezdomny in Lyubimov&#x27;s production of &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;, and the more major role of Svidrigailov in Yury Karyakin&#x27;s take on Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;. 

Vysotsky&#x27;s new songs during this time included &quot;Istoriya Bolezni&quot; (&quot;History of Illness&quot;), which concerned his health problems, the humorous &quot;Pochemu Aborigeny Syeli Kooka&quot; (&quot;Why Did the Aborigines Eat Captain Cook&quot;), &quot;Ballada o Pravda i Lzhi&quot; (&quot;Ballad of Truth and Lies&quot;), and &quot;Dve Sud&#x27;by&quot; (&quot;Two Fates&quot;), a chilling story of a self-absorbed alcoholic hunted by two malevolent witches.

In 1977 Vysotsky&#x27;s health deteriorated to such an extent that in April he found himself in a Moscow clinic&#x27;s reanimation center in а state of physical and mental collapse. He suffered heart, kidney, and liver failures, a jaw infection, and a nervous breakdown.

=== 1977–1980 ===
In 1977 three of Vysotsky&#x27;s LPs were released in France, including the one he recorded with RCA during his trip to Canada in the previous year. Arranged and accompanied by guitarist Kostya Kazansky, this was the first time Vysotsky enjoyed a relatively sophisticated musical backing. 

In August 1977 Vysotsky performed in Hollywood for the film crew of &quot;New York, New York&quot; (1977), and, according to Vlady, was greeted warmly by actors including Liza Minnelli and Robert De Niro. Further concerts in Los Angeles were followed by an appearance at an annual event held by the French Communist paper &quot;L’Humanité&quot;. 

In December 1977 the Taganka Theatre troupe traveled to France to perform &quot;Hamlet&quot;, with Vysotsky back in the lead. The play received positive reviews.

In March–April of 1978 Vysotsky did a series of concerts in Moscow and Ukraine. Subsequently, in May 1978 Vysotsky began filming in &quot;The Meeting Place Cannot Be Changed&quot;, a five-part television film about two detectives pursuing a criminal gang in 1945 Moscow. Vysotsky starred as Gleb Zheglov, a ruthless and charismatic cop mentoring his milder and more rule-abiding partner Vladimir Sharapov (played by Vladimir Konkin). The film premiered on 11 November 1978 on Soviet Central TV.

During this time Vysotsky also became involved in Taganka Theatre&#x27;s &quot;Genre-seeking&quot; show (performing some of his own songs) and played Aleksander Blok in Anatoly Efros&#x27; &quot;Neznakomka&quot; (&quot;The Lady Stranger&quot;) radio play, which premiered on 10 July 1979 and later released as a double LP.

In November 1978 Vysotsky took part in the underground censorship-defying literary project &quot;Metropol&#x27;&quot;, inspired and organized by Vasily Aksenov. In January 1979 Vysotsky again visited America with highly successful series of concerts. That was the point (according to biographer Vladimir Novikov) when a glimpse of new, clean life of a respectable international actor and performer all but made Vysotsky seriously reconsider his priorities. What followed though, was a return to the self-destructive theater and concert tours schedule, personal doctor Anatoly Fedotov now not only his companion, but part of Taganka&#x27;s crew. &quot;Who was this Anatoly? Just a man who in every possible situation would try to provide drugs. And he did provide. In such moments Volodya trusted him totally,&quot; Oksana Afanasyeva, Vysotsky&#x27;s Moscow girlfriend (who was near him for most of the last year of his life and, on occasion, herself served as a drug courier) remembered. In July 1979, after a series of Central Asia concerts, Vysotsky collapsed, experienced clinical death and was resuscitated by Fedotov (who injected caffeine into the heart directly), colleague and close friend Vsevolod Abdulov helping with heart massage. In January 1980 Vysotsky asked Lyubimov for a year&#x27;s leave. &quot;Up to you, but on condition that Hamlet is yours,&quot; was the answer. The songwriting showed signs of slowing down, as Vysotsky began switching from songs to more conventional poetry. 
Still, of nearly 800 poems by Vysotsky only one has been published in the Soviet Union while he was alive. Not a single performance or interview was broadcast by the Soviet television in his lifetime.

In May 1979, being in a practice studio of the MSU Faculty of Journalism, Vysotsky recorded a video letter to American actor and film producer Warren Beatty, looking for both a personal meeting with Beatty and an opportunity to get a role in &quot;Reds&quot; film, to be produced and directed by the latter. While recording, Vysotsky made a few attempts to speak English, trying to overcome the language barrier. This video letter never reached Beatty. It was broadcast for the first time more than three decades later, on the night of 24 January 2013 (local time) by Rossiya 1 channel, along with records of TV channels of Italy, Mexico, Poland, USA and from private collections, in &quot;Vladimir Vysotsky. A letter to Warren Beatty&quot; film by Alexander Kovanovsky and Igor Rakhmanov. While recording this video, Vysotsky had a rare opportunity to perform for a camera, being still unable to do it with Soviet television.

On 22 January 1980, Vysotsky entered the Moscow Ostankino TV Center to record his one and only studio concert for the Soviet television. What proved to be an exhausting affair (his concentration lacking, he had to plod through several takes for each song) was premiered on the Soviet TV eight years later. The last six months of his life saw Vysotsky appearing on stage sporadically, fueled by heavy dosages of drugs and alcohol. His performances were often erratic. Occasionally Vysotsky paid visits to institute&#x27;s ER unit, but would not hear of Marina Vlady&#x27;s suggestions for him to take long-term rehabilitation course in a Western clinic. Yet he kept writing, mostly poetry and even prose, but songs as well. The last song he performed was the agonizing &quot;My Sorrow, My Anguish&quot; and his final poem, written one week prior to his death was &quot;A Letter to Marina&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m less than fifty, but the time is short / By you and God protected, life and limb / I have a song or two to sing before the Lord / I have a way to make my peace with him.&quot;

== Death ==
Although several theories of the ultimate cause of the singer&#x27;s death persist to this day, given what is now known about cardiovascular disease, it seems likely that by the time of his death Vysotsky had an advanced coronary condition brought about by years of tobacco, alcohol and drug abuse, as well as his grueling work schedule and the stress of the constant harassment by the government. Towards the end, most of Vysotsky&#x27;s closest friends had become aware of the ominous signs and were convinced that his demise was only a matter of time. Clear evidence of this can be seen in a video ostensibly shot by the Japanese NHK channel only months before Vysotsky&#x27;s death, where he appears visibly unwell, breathing heavily and slurring his speech. Accounts by Vysotsky&#x27;s close friends and colleagues concerning his last hours were compiled in the book by V. Perevozchikov.

Vysotsky suffered from alcoholism for most of his life. Sometime around 1977, he started using amphetamines and other prescription narcotics in an attempt to counteract the debilitating hangovers and eventually to rid himself of alcohol addiction. While these attempts were partially successful, he ended up trading alcoholism for a severe drug dependency that was fast spiralling out of control. He was reduced to begging some of his close friends in the medical profession for supplies of drugs, often using his acting skills to collapse in a medical office and imitate a seizure or some other condition requiring a painkiller injection. On 25 July 1979 (a year to the day before his death) he suffered a cardiac arrest and was clinically dead for several minutes during a concert tour of Soviet Uzbekistan, after injecting himself with a wrong kind of painkiller he had previously obtained from a dentist&#x27;s office.

Fully aware of the dangers of his condition, Vysotsky made several attempts to cure himself of his addiction. He underwent an experimental (and ultimately discredited) blood purification procedure offered by a leading drug rehabilitation specialist in Moscow. He also went to an isolated retreat in France with his wife Marina in the spring of 1980 as a way of forcefully depriving himself of any access to drugs. After these attempts failed, Vysotsky returned to Moscow to find his life in an increasingly stressful state of disarray. He had been a defendant in two criminal trials, one for a car wreck he had caused some months earlier, and one for an alleged conspiracy to sell unauthorized concert tickets (he eventually received a suspended sentence and a probation in the first case, and the charges in the second were dismissed, although several of his co-defendants were found guilty). He also unsuccessfully fought the film studio authorities for the rights to direct a movie called &quot;The Green Phaeton&quot;. Relations with his wife Marina were deteriorating, and he was torn between his loyalty to her and his love for his mistress Oksana Afanasyeva. He had also developed severe inflammation in one of his legs, making his concert performances extremely challenging.

In a final desperate attempt to overcome his drug addiction, partially prompted by his inability to obtain drugs through his usual channels (the authorities had imposed a strict monitoring of the medical institutions to prevent illicit drug distribution during the 1980 Olympics), he relapsed into alcohol and went on a prolonged drinking binge (apparently consuming copious amounts of champagne due to a prevalent misconception at the time that it was better than vodka at countering the effects of drug withdrawal).

On 3 July 1980, Vysotsky gave a performance at a suburban Moscow concert hall. One of the stage managers recalls that he looked visibly unhealthy (&quot;gray-faced&quot;, as she puts it) and complained of not feeling too good, while another says she was surprised by his request for champagne before the start of the show, as he had always been known for completely abstaining from drink before his concerts. On 16 July Vysotsky gave his last public concert in Kaliningrad. On 18 July, Vysotsky played &quot;Hamlet&quot; for the last time at the Taganka Theatre. From around 21 July, several of his close friends were on a round-the-clock watch at his apartment, carefully monitoring his alcohol intake and hoping against all odds that his drug dependency would soon be overcome and they would then be able to bring him back from the brink. The effects of drug withdrawal were clearly getting the better of him, as he got increasingly restless, moaned and screamed in pain, and at times fell into memory lapses, failing to recognize at first some of his visitors, including his son Arkadiy. At one point, Vysotsky&#x27;s personal physician A. Fedotov (the same doctor who had brought him back from clinical death a year earlier in Uzbekistan) attempted to sedate him, inadvertently causing asphyxiation from which he was barely saved. On 24 July, Vysotsky told his mother that he thought he was going to die that day, and then made similar remarks to a few of the friends present at the apartment, who begged him to stop such talk and keep his spirits up. But soon thereafter, Oksana Afanasyeva saw him clench his chest several times, which led her to suspect that he was genuinely suffering from a cardiovascular condition. She informed Fedotov of this but was told not to worry, as he was going to monitor Vysotsky&#x27;s condition all night. In the evening, after drinking relatively small amounts of alcohol, the moaning and groaning Vysotsky was sedated by Fedotov, who then sat down on the couch next to him but fell asleep. Fedotov awoke in the early hours of 25 July to an unusual silence and found Vysotsky dead in his bed with his eyes wide open, apparently of a myocardial infarction, as he later certified. This was contradicted by Fedotov&#x27;s colleagues, Sklifosovsky Emergency Medical Institute physicians L. Sul&#x27;povar and S. Scherbakov (who had demanded the actor&#x27;s immediate hospitalization on 23 July but were allegedly rebuffed by Fedotov), who insisted that Fedotov&#x27;s incompetent sedation combined with alcohol was what killed Vysotsky. An autopsy was prevented by Vysotsky&#x27;s parents (who were eager to have their son&#x27;s drug addiction remain secret), so the true cause of death remains unknown.

No official announcement of the actor&#x27;s death was made, only a brief obituary appeared in the Moscow newspaper &quot;Vechernyaya Moskva&quot;, and a note informing of Vysotsky&#x27;s death and cancellation of the &quot;Hamlet&quot; performance was put out at the entrance to the Taganka Theatre (the story goes that not a single ticket holder took advantage of the refund offer). Despite this, by the end of the day, millions had learned of Vysotsky&#x27;s death. On 28 July, he lay in state at the Taganka Theatre. After a mourning ceremony involving an unauthorized mass gathering of unprecedented scale, Vysotsky was buried at the Vagankovskoye Cemetery in Moscow. The attendance at the Olympic events dropped noticeably on that day, as scores of spectators left to attend the funeral. Tens of thousands of people lined the streets to catch a glimpse of his coffin.

=== Controversy surrounding circumstances of death ===
According to author Valery Perevozchikov part of the blame for his death lay with the group of associates who surrounded him in the last years of his life. This inner circle were all people under the influence of his strong character, combined with a material interest in the large sums of money his concerts earned. This list included Valerii Yankelovich, manager of the Taganka Theatre and prime organiser of his non-sanctioned concerts; Anatoly Fedotov, his personal doctor; Vadim Tumanov, gold prospector (and personal friend) from Siberia; Oksana Afanasyeva (later Yarmolnik), his mistress the last three years of his life; Ivan Bortnik, a fellow actor; and Leonid Sul&#x27;povar, a department head at the Sklifosovski hospital who was responsible for much of the supply of drugs.

Vysotsky&#x27;s associates had all put in efforts to supply his drug habit, which kept him going in the last years of his life. Under their influence, he was able to continue to perform all over the country, up to a week before his death. Due to illegal (i.e. non-state-sanctioned) sales of tickets and other underground methods, these concerts pulled in sums of money unimaginable in Soviet times, when almost everyone received nearly the same small salary. The payouts and gathering of money were a constant source of danger, and Yankelovich and others were needed to organise them.

Some money went to Vysotsky, the rest was distributed amongst this circle. At first this was a reasonable return on their efforts; however, as his addiction progressed and his body developed resistance, the frequency and amount of drugs needed to keep Vysotsky going became unmanageable. This culminated at the time of the Moscow Olympics which coincided with the last days of his life, when supplies of drugs were monitored more strictly than usual, and some of the doctors involved in supplying Vysotsky were already behind bars (normally the doctors had to account for every ampule, thus drugs were transferred to an empty container, while the patients received a substitute or placebo instead). In the last few days Vysotsky became uncontrollable, his shouting could be heard all over the apartment building on Malaya Gruzinskaya St. where he lived amongst VIP&#x27;s. Several days before his death, in a state of stupor he went on a high speed drive around Moscow in an attempt to obtain drugs and alcohol – when many high-ranking people saw him. This increased the likelihood of him being forcibly admitted to the hospital, and the consequent danger to the circle supplying his habit. As his state of health declined, and it became obvious that he might die, his associates gathered to decide what to do with him. They came up with no firm decision. They did not want him admitted officially, as his drug addiction would become public and they would fall under suspicion, although some of them admitted that any ordinary person in his condition would have been admitted immediately.

On Vysotsky&#x27;s death his associates and relatives put in much effort to prevent a post-mortem being carried out. This despite the fairly unusual circumstances: he died aged 42 under heavy sedation with an improvised cocktail of sedatives and stimulants, including the toxic chloral hydrate, provided by his personal doctor who had been supplying him with narcotics the previous three years. This doctor, being the only one present at his side when death occurred, had a few days earlier been seen to display elementary negligence in treating the sedated Vysotsky. On the night of his death, Arkadii Vysotsky (his son), who tried to visit his father in his apartment, was rudely refused entry by Yankelovich, even though there was a lack of people able to care for him. Subsequently, the Soviet police commenced a manslaughter investigation which was dropped due to the absence of evidence taken at the time of death.

==Personal life==

===Relationships===

==== Iza Zhukova ====

Vysotsky&#x27;s first wife was Iza Zhukova. They met in 1956, being both MAT theater institute students, lived for some time at Vysotsky&#x27;s mother&#x27;s flat in Moscow. After her graduation (Iza was 2 years older) they spent months in different cities (she in Kiev, then Rostov) and finally married on 25 April 1960.

==== Lyudmila Abramova ====

Vysotsky met Lyudmila Abramova in September 1961, while they were both filming &quot;713 Requests Permission to Land&quot; in Leningrad. Abramova was still a student at Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography, while Vysotsky was then with the Moscow Pushkin Drama Theatre.

They married in 1965 and had two sons, Arkady (born 1962) and Nikita (born 1964). Their relationship ended when she realized that Vysotsky had been cheating on her.

In an interview in 2018, Abramova said that she was largely happy while they were together, even if there were occasional bad times.

==== Tatyana Ivanenko ====

While still married to Lyudmila Abramova, Vysotsky began a romantic relationship with Tatyana Ivanenko, a Taganka actress.

==== Marina Vlady ====

In 1967 Vysotsky fell in love with Marina Vlady, a French actress of Russian descent, who was working at Mosfilm on a joint Soviet-French production at that time. As a result, 1968 marked the point when &quot;proper&quot; love songs started to appear in his repertoire, documenting the beginning of their love affair.

After his visit with Khruschev in 1969, Vysotsky took Marina Vlady to director &#x27;s place to investigate her Belarusian roots. They subsequently married on 1 December 1970, causing a furor among Moscow&#x27;s cultural and political elite. They spent their honeymoon in Georgia, during which time Vysotsky wrote numerous new songs, including &quot;Ya Ne Lyublyu&quot; (&quot;I Don&#x27;t Like&quot;).

For 10 years the two maintained a long-distance relationship as Marina compromised her career in France to spend more time in Moscow, and Vladimir&#x27;s friends pulled strings for him to be allowed to travel abroad to stay with his wife. Marina eventually joined the Communist Party of France, which essentially gave her an unlimited-entry visa into the Soviet Union, and provided Vladimir with some immunity against prosecution by the government, which was becoming weary of his covertly anti-Soviet lyrics and his odds-defying popularity with the masses. The problems of his long-distance relationship with Vlady inspired several of Vysotsky&#x27;s songs.

== Legacy and remembrance ==
In the autumn of 1981 Vysotsky&#x27;s first collection of poetry was officially published in the USSR, called &quot;The Nerve&quot; (&quot;Нерв&quot;). Its first edition (25,000 copies) was sold out instantly. In 1982 the second one followed (100,000), then the 3rd (1988, 200,000), followed in the 1990s by several more. The material for it was compiled by Robert Rozhdestvensky, an officially laurelled Soviet poet. Also in 1981 Yuri Lyubimov staged at Taganka a new music and poetry production called &quot;Vladimir Vysotsky&quot; which was promptly banned and officially premiered on 25 January 1989.

In 1982 the motion picture &quot;The Ballad of the Valiant Knight Ivanhoe&quot; was produced in the Soviet Union and in 1983 the movie was released to the public. Four songs by Vysotsky were featured in the film.

In 1986 the official Vysotsky poetic heritage committee was formed (with Robert Rozhdestvensky at the helm, theater critic Natalya Krymova being both the instigator and the organizer). Despite some opposition from the conservatives (Yegor Ligachev was the latter&#x27;s political leader, Stanislav Kunyaev of &quot;Nash Sovremennik&quot; represented its literary flank) Vysotsky was rewarded posthumously with the USSR State Prize. The official formula – &quot;for creating the character of Zheglov and artistic achievements as a singer-songwriter&quot; was much derided from both the left and the right. In 1988 the &quot;Selected Works of...&quot; (edited by N. Krymova) compilation was published, preceded by &quot;I Will Surely Return...&quot; (Я, конечно, вернусь...) book of fellow actors&#x27; memoirs and Vysotsky&#x27;s verses, some published for the first time. In 1990 two volumes of extensive &quot;The Works of...&quot; were published, financed by the late poet&#x27;s father Semyon Vysotsky. Even more ambitious publication series, self-proclaimed &quot;the first ever academical edition&quot; (the latter assertion being dismissed by sceptics) compiled and edited by Sergey Zhiltsov, were published in Tula (1994–1998, 5 volumes), Germany (1994, 7 volumes) and Moscow (1997, 4 volumes).
In 1989 the official Vysotsky Museum opened in Moscow, with the magazine of its own called &quot;Vagant&quot; (edited by Sergey Zaitsev) devoted entirely to Vysotsky&#x27;s legacy. In 1996 it became an independent publication and was closed in 2002.

In the years to come, Vysotsky&#x27;s grave became a site of pilgrimage for several generations of his fans, the youngest of whom were born after his death. His tombstone also became the subject of controversy, as his widow had wished for a simple abstract slab, while his parents insisted on a realistic gilded statue. Although probably too solemn to have inspired Vysotsky himself, the statue is believed by some to be full of metaphors and symbols reminiscent of the singer&#x27;s life.

In 1995 in Moscow the Vysotsky monument was officially opened at Strastnoy Boulevard, by the Petrovsky Gates. Among those present were the bard&#x27;s parents, two of his sons, first wife Iza, renown poets Yevtushenko and Voznesensky. &quot;Vysotsky had always been telling the truth. Only once he was wrong when he sang in one of his songs: &#x27;They will never erect me a monument in a square like that by Petrovskye Vorota&#x27;&quot;, Mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov said in his speech. A further monument to Vysotsky was erected in 2014 at Rostov-on-Don.

In October 2004, a monument to Vysotsky was erected in the Montenegrin capital of Podgorica, near the Millennium Bridge. His son, Nikita Vysotsky, attended the unveiling. The statue was designed by Russian sculptor Alexander Taratinov, who also designed a monument to Alexander Pushkin in Podgorica. The bronze statue shows Vysotsky standing on a pedestal, with his one hand raised and the other holding a guitar. Next to the figure lies a bronze skull – a reference to Vysotsky&#x27;s monumental lead performances in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. On the pedestal the last lines from a poem of Vysotsky&#x27;s, dedicated to Montenegro, are carved.

The Vysotsky business center &amp; semi-skyscraper was officially opened in Yekaterinburg, in 2011. It is the tallest building in Russia outside of Moscow, has 54 floors, total height: . On the third floor of the business center is the Vysotsky Museum. Behind the building is a bronze sculpture of Vladimir Vysotsky and his third wife, French actress Marina Vlady.

In 2011 a controversial movie &quot;Vysotsky. Thank You For Being Alive&quot; was released, script written by his son, Nikita Vysotsky. The actor Sergey Bezrukov portrayed Vysotsky, using a combination of a mask and CGI effects. The film tells about Vysotsky&#x27;s illegal underground performances, problems with KGB and drugs, and subsequent clinical death in 1979.

Shortly after Vysotsky&#x27;s death, many Russian bards started writing songs and poems about his life and death. The best known are Yuri Vizbor&#x27;s &quot;Letter to Vysotsky&quot; (1982) and Bulat Okudzhava&#x27;s &quot;About Volodya Vysotsky&quot; (1980). In Poland, Jacek Kaczmarski based some of his songs on those of Vysotsky, such as his first song (1977) was based on &quot;The Wolfhunt&quot;, and dedicated to his memory the song &quot;Epitafium dla Włodzimierza Wysockiego&quot; (&quot;Epitaph for Vladimir Vysotsky&quot;).

Every year on Vysotsky&#x27;s birthday festivals are held throughout Russia and in many communities throughout the world, especially in Europe. Vysotsky&#x27;s impact in Russia is often compared to that of Wolf Biermann in Germany, Bob Dylan in America, or Georges Brassens and Jacques Brel in France.

The asteroid 2374 Vladvysotskij, discovered by Lyudmila Zhuravleva, was named after Vysotsky.

During the Annual Q&amp;A Event Direct Line with Vladimir Putin, Alexey Venediktov asked Putin to name a street in Moscow after the singer Vladimir Vysotsky, who, though considered one of the greatest Russian artists, has no street named after him in Moscow almost 30 years after his death. Venediktov stated a Russian law that allowed the President to do so and promote a law suggestion to name a street by decree. Putin answered that he would talk to Mayor of Moscow and would solve this problem. In July 2015 former Upper and Lower Tagansky Dead-ends (Верхний и Нижний Таганские тупики) in Moscow were reorganized into Vladimir Vysotsky Street.

The Sata Kieli Cultural Association, [Finland], organizes the annual International Vladimir Vysotsky Festival (Vysotski Fest), where Vysotsky&#x27;s singers from different countries perform in Helsinki and other Finnish cities. They sing Vysotsky in different languages and in different arrangements.

Two brothers and singers from Finland, Mika and Turkka Mali, over the course of their more than 30-year musical career, have translated into Finnish, recorded and on numerous occasions publicly performed songs of Vladimir Vysotsky.

Throughout his lengthy musical career, Jaromír Nohavica, a famed Czech singer, translated and performed numerous songs of Vladimir Vysotsky, most notably &quot;Песня о друге (Píseň o příteli – Song about a friend)&quot;.

The Museum of Vladimir Vysotsky in Koszalin dedicated to Vladimir Vysotsky was founded by Marlena Zimna (1969–2016) in May 1994, in her apartment, in the city of Koszalin, in Poland. Since then the museum has collected over 19,500 exhibits from different countries and currently holds Vladimir Vysotsky&#x27; personal items, autographs, drawings, letters, photographs and a large library containing unique film footage, vinyl records, CDs and DVDs. A special place in the collection holds a Vladimir Vysotsky&#x27;s guitar, on which he played at a concert in Casablanca in April 1976. Vladimir Vysotsky presented this guitar to Moroccan journalist Hassan El-Sayed together with an autograph (an extract from Vladimir Vysotsky&#x27;s song &quot;What Happened in Africa&quot;), written in Russian right on the guitar.

In January 2023, a monument to the outstanding actor, singer and poet Vladimir Vysotsky was unveiled in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, in the square near the Rodina House of Culture. Author Vladimir Chebotarev.

=== Books on Vladimir Vysotsky ===
After her husband&#x27;s death, urged by her friend Simone Signoret, Marina Vlady wrote a book called &quot;The Aborted Flight&quot; about her years together with Vysotsky. The book paid tribute to Vladimir&#x27;s talent and rich persona, yet was uncompromising in its depiction of his addictions and the problems that they caused in their marriage. Written in French (and published in France in 1987), it was translated into Russian in tandem by Vlady and a professional translator and came out in 1989 in the USSR. Totally credible from the specialists&#x27; point of view, the book caused controversy, among other things, by shocking revelations about the difficult father-and-son relationship (or rather, the lack of any), implying that Vysotsky-senior (while his son was alive) was deeply ashamed of him and his songs which he deemed &quot;anti-Soviet&quot; and reported his own son to the KGB. Also in 1989 another important book of memoirs was published in the USSR, providing a bulk of priceless material for the host of future biographers, Alla Demidova&#x27;s &quot;Vladimir Vysotsky, the One I Know and Love&quot;. Among other publications of note were Valery Zolotukhin&#x27;s &quot;Vysotsky&#x27;s Secret&quot; (2000), a series of Valery Perevozchikov&#x27;s books (&quot;His Dying Hour&quot;, &quot;The Unknown Vysotsky&quot; and others) containing detailed accounts and interviews dealing with the bard&#x27;s life&#x27;s major controversies (the mystery surrounding his death, the truth behind Vysotsky Sr.&#x27;s alleged KGB reports, the true nature of Vladimir Vysotsky&#x27;s relations with his mother Nina&#x27;s second husband Georgy Bartosh etc.), Iza Zhukova&#x27;s &quot;Short Happiness for a Lifetime&quot; and the late bard&#x27;s sister-in-law Irena Vysotskaya&#x27;s &quot;My Brother Vysotsky. The Beginnings&quot; (both 2005).

A group of enthusiasts has created a non-profit project – the mobile application &quot;Vysotsky&quot;

== Music ==
The multifaceted talent of Vysotsky is often described by the term &quot;bard&quot; (&quot;бард&quot;) that Vysotsky has never been enthusiastic about. He thought of himself mainly as an actor and poet rather than a singer, and once remarked, &quot;I do not belong to what people call bards or minstrels or whatever.&quot; With the advent of portable tape-recorders in the Soviet Union, Vysotsky&#x27;s music became available to the masses in the form of home-made reel-to-reel audio tape recordings (later on cassette tapes).

Vysotsky accompanied himself on a Russian seven-string guitar, with a raspy voice singing ballads of love, peace, war, everyday Soviet life and of the human condition. He was largely perceived as the voice of honesty, at times sarcastically jabbing at the Soviet government, which made him a target for surveillance and threats. In France, he has been compared with Georges Brassens; in Russia, however, he was more frequently compared with Joe Dassin, partly because they were the same age and died in the same year, although their ideologies, biographies, and musical styles are very different. Vysotsky&#x27;s lyrics and style greatly influenced Jacek Kaczmarski, a Polish songwriter and singer who touched on similar themes.

Not being officially recognized as a poet and singer, Vysotsky performed wherever and whenever he couldin the theater (where he worked), at universities, in private apartments, village clubs, and in the open air. It was not unusual for him to give several concerts in one day. He used to sleep little, using the night hours to write. With few exceptions, he wasn&#x27;t allowed to publish his recordings with &quot;Melodiya&quot;, which held a monopoly on the Soviet music industry. His songs were passed on through amateur, fairly low quality recordings on vinyl discs and magnetic tape, resulting in his immense popularity. Cosmonauts even took his music on cassette into orbit.

===Themes===

Vysotsky&#x27;s songs—over 600 of them—were written about almost any imaginable theme. The earliest were blatnaya pesnya (&quot;outlaw songs&quot;). These songs were based either on the life of the common people in Moscow or on life in the crime people, sometimes in Gulag. Vysotsky slowly grew out of this phase and started singing more serious, though often satirical, songs. Many of these songs were about war. These war songs were not written to glorify war, but rather to expose the listener to the emotions of those in extreme, life-threatening situations. Most Soviet veterans would say that Vysotsky&#x27;s war songs described the truth of war far more accurately than more official &quot;patriotic&quot; songs.
Nearly all of Vysotsky&#x27;s songs are in the first person, although he is almost never the narrator. When singing his criminal songs, he would adopt the accent and intonation of a Moscow thief, and when singing war songs, he would sing from the point of view of a soldier. In many of his philosophical songs, he adopted the role of inanimate objects. In essence, Vysotsky&#x27;s songs were miniature theatrical dramatizations, often with a protagonist and containing many dialogues. He achieved such a high level of authenticity that many real life former prisoners, war veterans, boxers, and footballers refused to believe that Vysotsky had not himself spent time behind bars, fought in the war, or been a boxer or footballer. Following his first solo concerts at the Leningrad Nuclear Physics Institute, he published a note for his fans with the words: &quot;Now that you&#x27;ve heard all these songs, please, don&#x27;t you make a mistake of mixing me with my characters, I am not like them at all. With love, Vysotsky, 20 April 1965, XX c.&quot; He found it necessary to make similar excuses throughout his career.

Veteran screenwriter Nikolay Erdman said of Vysotsky&#x27;s work: &quot;I can well understand how Mayakovsky or Seryozha Yesenin did it. How Volodya Vysotsky does it is totally beyond me.&quot; 

However, one of the themes in his repertoire was considerably more autobiographical: alcoholism, with which he personally struggled. By the time of his breakthrough in 1967, he had already suffered several physical breakdowns, and once was sent (by the director of the Taganka Theatre) to a rehabilitation clinic, a visit he had to repeat multiple times thereafter.

===Musical style===
Musically, virtually all of Vysotsky&#x27;s songs were written in a minor key, and tended to employ from three to seven chords. Vysotsky composed his songs and played them exclusively on the Russian seven string guitar, often tuned a tone or a tone-and-a-half below the traditional Russian &quot;Open G major&quot; tuning. This guitar, with its specific Russian tuning, makes a slight yet notable difference in chord voicings than the standard tuned six string Spanish (classical) guitar, and it became a staple of his sound. Because Vysotsky tuned down a tone and a half, his strings had less tension, which also colored the sound.

His earliest songs were usually written in C minor (with the guitar tuned a tone down from DGBDGBD to CFACFAC), using the following chord shapes:

Songs written in this key include &quot;Stars&quot; (Zvyozdy), &quot;My friend left for Magadan&quot; (Moy drug uyekhal v Magadan), and most of his &quot;outlaw songs&quot;.

At around 1970, Vysotsky began writing and playing exclusively in A minor (guitar tuned to CFACFAC), which he continued doing until his death. The main chord shapes he based his songs on were:

Vysotsky used his fingers instead of a pick to pluck and strum, as was the tradition with Russian guitar playing. He used a variety of finger picking and strumming techniques. One of his favorite was to play an alternating bass with his thumb as he plucked or strummed with his other fingers.

Often, Vysotsky would neglect to check the tuning of his guitar, which is particularly noticeable on earlier recordings. According to some accounts, Vysotsky would get upset when friends would attempt to tune his guitar, leading some to believe that he preferred to play slightly out of tune as a stylistic choice. Much of this is also attributable to the fact that a guitar that is tuned down more than 1 whole step (Vysotsky would sometimes tune as much as 2 and a half steps down) is prone to intonation problems.

=== Singing style ===
Apart from his recognizable raspy voice, Vysotsky had a unique singing style. He had an unusual habit of elongating consonants instead of vowels in his songs. So when a syllable is sung for a prolonged period of time, he would elongate the consonant instead of the vowel in that syllable.

<text>The eastern kingbird (Tyrannus tyrannus) is a large tyrant flycatcher native to the Americas. The bird is predominantly dark gray with white underbelly and pointed wings. Eastern kingbirds are conspicuous and are commonly found in open areas with scattered trees and bushes, where they perch while foraging for insects. The Eastern kingbird is migratory, with its breeding range spread across North America and its wintering range in Central and South America.

==Taxonomy==
The eastern kingbird was described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name of &quot;Lanius tyrannus&quot;. The present genus &quot;Tyrannus&quot; was introduced in 1799 by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède with the eastern kingbird as the type species. The species is monotypic; no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
Adults are grey-black on the upperparts with light underparts; they have a long black tail with a white end and long, pointed wings. They have a red patch on their crown, seldom seen. They are of average size for a kingbird, at , across the wings and weighing .

The call is a high-pitched, buzzing and unmusical chirp, frequently compared to an electric fence.

==Distribution and range==
Their breeding habitat is open areas across North America. They make a sturdy cup nest in a tree or shrub, sometimes on top of a stump or pole. These birds aggressively defend their territory, even against much larger birds.

These birds migrate in flocks to South America. There are three European records, all from the British Isles: two from Ireland in October 2012 and September 2013, and one from Scotland in September 2016.

==Behavior==
===Breeding===
Some eastern kingbirds place their nests in the open, while others hide their nests well. Eastern kingbirds in southern British Columbia may nest in open fields, in shrubs over open water, high up in trees, and even in the tops of small stumps. Both male and female participate in nest defense, but females may stay on well-hidden nests longer than females with open nests, who may leave nests earlier to chase away predators. Those pairs nesting in the open may be able to see predators coming earlier and rely on aggressive behavior to protect their young.

The aggressive mobbing behavior of eastern kingbirds has been shown to keep ravens and crows from finding experimental nests placed near kingbird nests. Similar experimental nests placed further from the kingbird nests were more likely to be spotted by crows and ravens. Blue jays, American crows, squirrels, and tree-climbing snakes are on occasion kingbird nest predators. American kestrels likely prey on the adults.

===Food and feeding===

Eastern kingbirds wait on an open perch and fly out to catch insects in flight, sometimes hovering to pick prey off vegetation. They also eat berries and fruit, mainly in their wintering areas.

<text>Walter Travers (9 March 1548 - 1 February 1635) was an English Puritan theologian who served as the 2nd Provost of Trinity College Dublin from 1594 to 1598. He was also at one time chaplain to William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, and tutor to his son Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, who both served Queen Elizabeth I during her reign. 

He is remembered mostly as an opponent of the teaching of Richard Hooker. He was educated at the University of Cambridge, where he was admitted to Christ&#x27;s College before migrating to Trinity, and then traveled to Geneva to visit Theodore Beza. He was ordained by Thomas Cartwright in Antwerp, where in the late 1570s his work was favoured by the encouragement of Sir Francis Walsingham and Henry Killigrew (diplomat). He was a lecturer at the Temple Church in London in 1581, until he was forbidden to preach by Archbishop Whitgift in March 1586.

He was Provost of Trinity College Dublin from 1594 to 1598.

<text>Artemia is a genus of aquatic crustaceans also known as brine shrimp or &quot;sea monkeys&quot;. It is the only genus in the family Artemiidae. The first historical record of the existence of &quot;Artemia&quot; dates back to the first half of the 10th century AD from Lake Urmia, Iran, with an example called by an Iranian geographer an &quot;aquatic dog&quot;, although the first unambiguous record is the report and drawings made by Schlösser in 1757 of animals from Lymington, England. &quot;Artemia&quot; populations are found worldwide, typically in inland saltwater lakes, but occasionally in oceans. &quot;Artemia&quot; are able to avoid cohabiting with most types of predators, such as fish, by their ability to live in waters of very high salinity (up to 25%).

The ability of the &quot;Artemia&quot; to produce dormant eggs, known as cysts, has led to extensive use of &quot;Artemia&quot; in aquaculture. The cysts may be stored indefinitely and hatched on demand to provide a convenient form of live feed for larval fish and crustaceans. Nauplii of the brine shrimp &quot;Artemia&quot; constitute the most widely used food item, and over of dry &quot;Artemia&quot; cysts are marketed worldwide annually with most of the cysts being harvested from the Great Salt Lake in Utah. In addition, the resilience of &quot;Artemia&quot; makes them ideal animals for running biological toxicity assays and it has become a model organism used to test the toxicity of chemicals. Breeds of &quot;Artemia&quot; are sold as novelty gifts under the marketing name &quot;Sea-Monkeys&quot;.

==Description==
The brine shrimp &quot;Artemia&quot; comprises a group of seven to nine species very likely to have diverged from an ancestral form living in the Mediterranean area about , around the time of the Messinian salinity crisis.

The Laboratory of Aquaculture &amp; Artemia Reference Center at Ghent University possesses the largest known &quot;Artemia&quot; cyst collection, a cyst bank containing over 1,700 &quot;Artemia&quot; population samples collected from different locations around the world.

&quot;Artemia&quot; is a typical primitive arthropod with a segmented body to which is attached broad leaf-like appendages. The body usually consists of 19 segments, the first 11 of which have pairs of appendages, the next two which are often fused together carry the reproductive organs, and the last segments lead to the tail. The total length is usually about for the adult male and for the female, but the width of both sexes, including the legs, is about .

The body of &quot;Artemia&quot; is divided into head, thorax, and abdomen. The entire body is covered with a thin, flexible exoskeleton of chitin to which muscles are attached internally and which is shed periodically. In female &quot;Artemia,&quot; a moult precedes every ovulation.

For brine shrimp, many functions, including swimming, digestion and reproduction are not controlled through the brain; instead, local nervous system ganglia may control some regulation or synchronisation of these functions. Autotomy, the voluntary shedding or dropping of parts of the body for defence, is also controlled locally along the nervous system. &quot;Artemia&quot; have two types of eyes. They have two widely separated compound eyes mounted on flexible stalks. These compound eyes are the main optical sense organ in adult brine shrimps. The median eye, or the naupliar eye, is situated anteriorly in the centre of the head and is the only functional optical sense organ in the nauplii, which is functional until the adult stage.

==Ecology and behavior==
Brine shrimp can tolerate any levels of salinity from 25‰ to 250‰ (25–250 g/L), with an optimal range of 60‰–100‰, and occupy the ecological niche that can protect them from predators. Physiologically, optimal levels of salinity are about 30–35‰, but due to predators at these salt levels, brine shrimp seldom occur in natural habitats at salinities of less than 60–80‰. Locomotion is achieved by the rhythmic beating of the appendages acting in pairs. Respiration occurs on the surface of the legs through fibrous, feather-like plates (lamellar epipodites).

===Reproduction===
Males differ from females by having the second antennae markedly enlarged, and modified into clasping organs used in mating.
Adult female brine shrimp ovulate approximately every 140 hours. In favourable conditions, the female brine shrimp can produce eggs that almost immediately hatch. While in extreme conditions, such as low oxygen level or salinity above 150‰, female brine shrimp produce eggs with a chorion coating which has a brown colour. These eggs, also known as cysts, are metabolically inactive and can remain in total stasis for two years while in dry oxygen-free conditions, even at temperatures below freezing. This characteristic is called cryptobiosis, meaning &quot;hidden life&quot;. While in cryptobiosis, brine shrimp eggs can survive temperatures of liquid air () and a small percentage can survive above boiling temperature () for up to two hours.
Once placed in briny (salt) water, the eggs hatch within a few hours. The nauplius larvae are less than 0.4 mm in length when they first hatch. 
===Parthenogenesis===

Parthenogenesis is a natural form of reproduction in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilisation. Thelytoky is a particular form of parthenogenesis in which the development of a female individual occurs from an unfertilised egg. Automixis is a form of thelytoky, but there are different kinds of automixis. The kind of automixis relevant here is one in which two haploid products from the same meiosis combine to form a diploid zygote.

Diploid &quot;Artemia parthenogenetica&quot; reproduce by automictic parthenogenesis with central fusion (see diagram) and low but nonzero recombination. Central fusion of two of the haploid products of meiosis (see diagram) tends to maintain heterozygosity in transmission of the genome from mother to offspring, and to minimise inbreeding depression. Low crossover recombination during meiosis likely restrains the transition from heterozygosity to homozygosity over successive generations.

===Diet===
In their first stage of development, &quot;Artemia&quot; do not feed but consume their own energy reserves stored in the cyst. Wild brine shrimp eat microscopic planktonic algae. Cultured brine shrimp can also be fed particulate foods including yeast, wheat flour, soybean powder or egg yolk.

== Genetics, genomics and transcriptomics ==
&quot;Artemia&quot; comprises sexually reproducing, diploid species and several obligate parthenogenetic &quot;Artemia&quot; populations consisting of different clones and ploidies (2n-&gt;5n). Several genetic maps have been published for &quot;Artemia&quot;. The past years, different transcriptomic studies have been performed to elucidate biological responses in &quot;Artemia&quot;, such as its response to salt stress, toxins, infection and diapause termination. These studies also led to various fully assembled &quot;Artemia&quot; transcriptomes. Recently, the &quot;Artemia&quot; genome was assembled and annotated, revealing a genome containing an unequaled 58% of repeats, genes with unusually long introns and adaptations unique to the extremophilic nature of &quot;Artemia&quot; in high salt and low oxygen environments. These adaptations include a unique energy-intensive endocytosis-based salt excretion strategy resembling salt excretion strategies of plants, as well as several survival strategies for extreme environments it has in common with the extremophilic tardigrade.

==Aquaculture==

Fish farm owners search for a cost-effective, easy to use, and available food that is preferred by the fish. From cysts, brine shrimp nauplii can readily be used to feed fish and crustacean larvae just after a one-day incubation. Instar I (the nauplii that just hatched and with large yolk reserves in their body) and instar II nauplii (the nauplii after first moult and with functional digestive tracts) are more widely used in aquaculture, because they are easy for operation, rich in nutrients, and small, which makes them suitable for feeding fish and crustacean larvae live or after drying.

==Toxicity test==
&quot;Artemia&quot; found favor as a model organism for use in toxicological assays, despite the recognition that it is too robust an organism to be a sensitive indicator species.

In pollution research &quot;Artemia&quot;, the brine shrimp, has had extensive use as a test organism and in some circumstances is an acceptable alternative to the toxicity testing of mammals in the laboratory. The fact that millions of brine shrimp are so easily reared has been an important help in assessing the effects of a large number of environmental pollutants on the shrimps under well controlled experimental conditions.

==Conservation==
Overall, brine shrimp are abundant, but some populations and localized species do face threats, especially from habitat loss to introduced species. For example, &quot;A. franciscana&quot; of the Americas has been widely introduced to places outside its native range and is often able to outcompete local species, such as &quot;A. salina&quot; in the Mediterranean region.

Among the highly localized species are &quot;A. urmiana&quot; from Lake Urmia in Iran. Once abundant, the species has drastically declined due to drought, leading to fears that it was almost extinct. However, a second population of this species has recently been discovered in the Koyashskoye Salt Lake, Ukraine.

&quot;A. monica&quot;, the species commonly known as Mono Lake brine shrimp, can be found in Mono Lake, Mono County, California. In 1987, Dennis D. Murphy from Stanford University petitioned the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to add &quot;A. monica&quot; to the endangered species list under the Endangered Species Act (1973). The diversion of water by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power resulted in rising salinity and concentration of sodium hydroxide in Mono Lake. Despite the presence of trillions of brine shrimp in the lake, the petition contended that the increase in pH would endanger them. The threat to the lake&#x27;s water levels was addressed by a revision to California State Water Resources Control Board&#x27;s policy, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service found on 7 September 1995 that the Mono Lake brine shrimp did not warrant listing.
==Space experiment==
Scientists have taken the eggs of brine shrimp to outer space to test the impact of radiation on life. Brine shrimp cysts were flown on the U.S. Biosatellite 2, Apollo 16, and Apollo 17 missions, and on the Russian Bion-3 (Cosmos 782), Bion-5 (Cosmos 1129), Foton 10, and Foton 11 flights. Some of the Russian flights carried European Space Agency experiments.

On Apollo 16 and Apollo 17, the cysts traveled to the Moon and back. Cosmic rays that passed through an egg would be detected on the photographic film in its container. Some eggs were kept on Earth as experimental controls as part of the tests. Also, as the take-off in a spacecraft involves a lot of shaking and acceleration, one control group of egg cysts was accelerated to seven times the force of gravity and vibrated mechanically from side to side for several minutes so that they could experience the same violence of a rocket take-off. About 400 eggs were in each experimental group. All the egg cysts from the experiment were then placed in salt water to hatch under optimum conditions. The results showed &quot;A. salina&quot; eggs are highly sensitive to cosmic radiation; 90% of the embryos induced to develop from hit eggs died at different developmental stages.

The community began as a project led by George MacLeod, a minister of the Church of Scotland in Govan, Glasgow, to close the gap which he perceived between the church and working people. He took a group of ministers and working men to Iona to rebuild the ruined medieval Iona Abbey together. The community which grew out of this was initially under the supervision of an Iona Community Board reporting to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, but later the formal links with the Church of Scotland were loosened to allow the community more scope for ecumenical involvement.

The community appealed for funds to renovate the abbey leading to its re-opening, attended by Princess Anne, patron of the appeal, after a three-year closure in June 2021. The project was blessed by the &quot;Miracle in May&quot;, when fundraising in May obtained the £300,000 needed to keep contractors working. The re-opening was featured in Songs of Praise. 24 June 2021

==Community life and activities==
The Iona Community is a dispersed community. It has members who work and live throughout the world. There are 270 Members, around 1,800 Associate Members and 1,600 Friends of the Community. Among them are Presbyterians, Anglicans, Lutherans, Quakers, Roman Catholics and people of no denominational allegiance. The community has a strong commitment to ecumenism and to peace and justice issues.

The Iona Community runs three residential centres: Iona Abbey and the MacLeod Centre on the island of Iona, and Camas Tuath on Mull. Weeks at the centres often follow a programme related to the concerns of the Iona Community, and people are invited to come and share the life. A regular feature for guests staying in our centre on Iona is a pilgrimage around the island which includes meditations on discipleship; when the pilgrims reach the disused marble quarry or the machair, the common ground where the crofters once grazed sheep, for example, they stop for reflection on work and faithfulness.

The community has its own ecumenical liturgy which is used daily in the abbey and elsewhere.

Speaking about the visitor experience, Ruth Harvey, leader of the community, said: &quot;This is not a hotel or a conference centre. People come for reflection and inspiration, and to explore issues of importance – the environment, poverty, migration, equality – in the context of a Christian community and in a beautiful, rugged landscape.&quot;

==Worship==
Amongst the most widely known song and liturgical material from the Iona Community is the experimental worship developed by the Wild Goose Resource Group, based in Glasgow. The Group exists to encourage, enable and equip the shaping and creation of new forms of worship that are relevant, contextual and participatory. The current team consists of Jo Love, Jane Bentley and Iain McLarty.

The Wild Goose Resource Group was founded in 1987 by John L. Bell and Graham Maule. With their collaborators the Wild Goose Worship Group and more recently the Wild Goose Collective, the WGRG have produced around 50 published books and CDs. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Wild Goose Worship Group was influential in introducing songs from other cultures (particularly those from South Africa) to the repertoire of churches in the UK and elsewhere.

The approaches and practices of the Wild Goose Resource Group have been widely imitated and written about. Collections of Wild Goose Resource Group songs and texts have been published internationally, including translations into Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, Japanese, Dutch, West Frisian, Danish and German.

=== Notable Members ===
Bruce Kenrick, the founder of housing organisation Shelter, was a member.

Maxwell Craig, first general secretary of Action of Churches Together in Scotland (ACTS), was a member.

Douglas Haldane (1926-2012), child psychiatrist was a member of the community.

Alison Phipps, first UNESCO Chair in Refugee Integration through Languages and the Arts and at Glasgow University is a member.

==Miles Christi==
Miles Christi was a name given to the members of the Iona Community by its founder George MacLeod. The origin of this image of being a Soldier for Christ may have its roots in Martin of Tours who as a former Roman soldier applied similar discipline to Christian life and was a great inspiration to the early Church in Scotland. St Martin&#x27;s Cross, a high Celtic Cross carved in stone, stands to this day outside the entrance to the Church of Iona Abbey. The image also reflects a tradition of someone remaining on watch. The early Christian Community on Iona founded by St Columba sent members out to evangelise mainland Scotland and beyond, with some members remaining behind. George MacLeod had been a decorated soldier in the First World War. He founded the Iona Community just before the outbreak of the Second World War.

==Publishing activities==
The community&#x27;s publishing group, Wild Goose Publications, produces books on social justice, political and peace issues, holistic spirituality, healing, and innovative approaches to worship, including music (books, tapes, CDs), short drama scripts and material for personal reflection and group discussion. Many of these are the work of John L. Bell and the Wild Goose Resource Group.

<doc id="411203" wikidata="Q3570" url="?curid=411203" title="Washington Union Station">
<text>Washington Union Station, known locally as Union Station, is a major train station, transportation hub, and leisure destination in Washington, D.C. Designed by Daniel Burnham and opened in 1907, it is Amtrak&#x27;s second-busiest station and North America&#x27;s 10th-busiest railroad station. The station is the southern terminus of the Northeast Corridor, an electrified rail line extending north through major cities including Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston, and the busiest passenger rail line in the nation. In 2015, it served just under five million passengers.

An intermodal facility, Union Station also serves MARC and VRE commuter rail services, the Washington Metro, the DC Streetcar, intercity bus lines, and local Metrobus buses. It carries the IATA airport code of ZWU.

At the height of its traffic, during World War II, as many as 200,000 passengers passed through the station in a single day. In 1988, a headhouse wing was added and the original station renovated for use as a shopping mall. As of 2014, Union Station was one of the busiest rail facilities and shopping destinations in the United States, visited by over 40 million people a year. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors caused a sharp decline in retail and dining; by late 2022, more than half its commercial space was vacant, but Amtrak is attempting to regain control of the station and plans a major renovation and expansion.

==History==
===Pre-Union Station terminals===
Before Union Station opened, each of the major railroads operated out of one of two stations:
* New Jersey Avenue Station (1851–1907): Baltimore and Ohio Railroad trains arrived and left from this railroad station. It was located at the corner of New Jersey Avenue NW and C Street NW.
* Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station (1872–1907): Baltimore and Potomac Railroad (B&amp;P), a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, and the Southern Railway all left from this train station. It was located at the corner of B Street NW, now Constitution Avenue, and 6th Street NW.

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line ran east on D Street NE across North Capitol Street, then north on Delaware Avenue NE. It divided into two lines. The Metropolitan branch continued north on 1st Street NE, turning east on New York Ave NE and continuing north through Eckington. The other line turned east onto I Street NE up to 7th Street NE where it headed back north on what is today West Virginia Avenue running next to the &quot;Columbia Institution for the Deaf and Dumb&quot; (now Gallaudet University).

=== 20th century ===

==== Construction ====
When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced in 1901 that they had agreed to build a new union station together, the city had two reasons to celebrate. The decision meant that both railroads would soon remove their trackwork and terminals from the National Mall. Though changes there appeared only gradually, the consolidation of the depots allowed the creation of the Mall as it appears today. Secondly, the plan to bring all the city&#x27;s railroads under one roof promised that Washington would finally have a station both large enough to handle large crowds and impressive enough to befit the city&#x27;s role as the federal capital. The station was to be designed under the guidance of Daniel Burnham, a famed Chicago architect and member of the U.S. Senate Park Commission, who in September 1901 wrote to the Commission&#x27;s chairman, Sen. James McMillan, of the proposed project: &quot;The station and its surroundings should be treated in a monumental manner, as they will become the vestibule of the city of Washington, and as they will be in close proximity to the Capitol itself.&quot;

After two years of complicated and sometimes contentious negotiations, Congress passed S. 4825 (58th-1st session) entitled &quot;An Act to provide a union railroad station in the District of Columbia&quot; which was signed into law by 26th President Theodore Roosevelt on February 28, 1903. The Act authorized the Washington Terminal Company (which was to be jointly owned by the B&amp;O and the PRR-controlled Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad) to construct a station &quot;monumental in character&quot; that would cost at least $4 million (equivalent to $ in ). (The main station building&#x27;s actual cost eventually exceeded $5.9 million [equivalent to $ in ].) Including additional outlays for new terminal grades, approaches, bridges, viaducts, coach and freight yards, tunnels, shops, support buildings and other infrastructure, the total cost to the Terminal Company for all the improvements associated with Union Station exceeded $16 million (equivalent to $ in ). This cost was financed by $12 million (equivalent to $ in ) in first mortgage bonds as well as advances by the owners which were repaid by stock and cash.

Each carrier also received $1.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) in government funding to compensate them for the costs of eliminating grade crossings in the city. The only railroad station in the nation specifically authorized by the U.S. Congress, the building was primarily designed by William Pierce Anderson of the Chicago architectural firm of D.H. Burnham &amp; Company.

==== Effect on the neighborhood ====
Though the project was supported by the federal government, there was opposition at the local level. The new depot would displace residents and cleave new neighborhoods east of the tracks.

On January 10, 1902, representatives of the railroads presented preliminary plans for the construction of the &quot;Union Depot&quot; (Union Station) to representatives of the District of Columbia. They proposed to build tunnels under the tracks for K, L, and M Streets NE and to close H Street. The street would be closed on both sides of Delaware Avenue (for a total of ). If a tunnel was to be built for H Street NE, the cost would be an extra $10,000 (equivalent to $ in ).

Three days later, officers and members of the Northeast Washington Citizens&#x27; Association expressed their outrage to representatives of Congress and the railroads at an Association meeting at the Northeast Temple on H Street NE. The president of the Association claimed that the Pennsylvania Railroad controlled Congress; a member of the Association threatened to take the matter to court. The Association declared unacceptable the loss of a major access road to downtown for the residents of Northeast; the loss of millions of dollars of business properties and of the business it represented; the closure of a vital streetcar line used by commuters, considering the alternative cost of building an access across the tracks.

At the association&#x27;s March 10, 1902, meeting, its president told the audience that the District Commissioners had heard their complaints, and that H Street would remain open with a tunnel running under the tracks.

More than 100 houses were demolished to make way for the station and its tracks. The demolition erased the heart of an impoverished neighborhood called &quot;Swampoodle&quot; where crime was rampant. It was the end of a community but the beginning of a new era for Washington, D.C. Tiber Creek, which was prone to flooding, was put in a tunnel. Delaware Avenue disappeared from the map between Massachusetts Avenue and Florida Avenue under the tracks. Only a small section remains, next to the tracks between L and M Streets NE.

==== Opening and operation ====
The first B&amp;O train to arrive with passengers was the &quot;Pittsburgh Express&quot;, at 6:50 a.m. on October 27, 1907; the first PRR train arrived three weeks later on November 17. The main building itself was completed in 1908. Of its 32 station tracks, 20 enter from the northeast and terminate at the station&#x27;s headhouse. The remaining 12 tracks enter below ground level from the south via a 4,033-foot twin-tube tunnel passing under Capitol Hill and an 898-foot long subway under Massachusetts Avenue, which allow through traffic direct access to the rail networks both north and south of the city.

Among the new station&#x27;s unique features was an opulent &quot;Presidential Suite&quot; (aka &quot;State Reception Suite&quot;) where the U.S. President, State Department and Congressional leaders could receive distinguished visitors arriving in Washington. Provided with a separate entrance, the suite (which was first used by 27th President William Howard Taft in 1909) was also meant to safeguard the Chief Executive during his travels in an effort to prevent a repeat of the July, 1881 assassination of 20th President James A. Garfield in the old former Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station. The suite was converted in December 1941, during World War II, to a U.S.O. (United Services Organization) canteen, which went on to serve 6.5 million military service members during World War II. Although closed on May 31, 1946, it was reopened in 1951 as a U.S.O. lounge and dedicated by President Harry Truman as a permanent &quot;home away from home&quot; for traveling U.S. Armed Services members.

On the morning of January 15, 1953, the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Federal&quot;, the overnight train from Boston, crashed into the station. When the engineer tried to apply the trainline brakes two miles out of the platforms, he discovered that he only had engine brakes. A switchman on the approach to the station noticed the runaway train and telephoned a warning to the station, as the train coasted downhill into track 16. The GG1 electric locomotive, No. 4876, hit the bumper block at about , jumped onto the platform, destroyed the stationmaster&#x27;s office at the end of the track, took out a newsstand, and was on its way to crashing through the wall into the Great Hall. Just then, the floor of the terminal, having never been designed to carry the 475,000-pound weight of this locomotive, gave way, dropping the engine into the basement. The electric locomotive fell into about the center of what is now the food court. Remarkably, no one was killed, and passengers in the rear cars thought that they had only had a rough stop. An investigation revealed that an anglecock on the brakeline had been closed, probably by an icicle knocked from an overhead bridge. The accident inspired the finale of the 1976 film &quot;Silver Streak&quot;. The durable design of the GG1 made its damage repairable, and it was soon back in service after being hauled away in pieces to the PRR&#x27;s main shops in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Before the latter action was undertaken, however, the GG1 and the hole it made were temporarily planked over and hidden from view due to the imminent inauguration of General Dwight D. Eisenhower as the thirty-fourth President of the United States.

Until intercity passenger rail service was taken over by Amtrak on May 1, 1971, Union Station served as a hub for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, Pennsylvania Railroad, and Southern Railway. The Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac provided a link to Richmond, Virginia, about to the south, where major north–south lines of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and Seaboard Air Line Railroad provided service to the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida. World War II was the busiest period in the station&#x27;s history in terms of passenger traffic, with up to 200,000 people passing through on a single day.

==== Decline ====
In 1967, the chairman of the Civil Service Commission expressed interest in using Union Station as a visitor center during the upcoming Bicentennial celebrations. Funding for this was collected over the next six years, and the reconstruction of the station included outfitting the Main Hall with a recessed pit to display a slide show presentation. This was officially the PAVE (Primary Audio-Visual Experience), but was sarcastically referred to as &quot;the Pit&quot;. The entire project was completed, save for the parking garage, and opening ceremonies were held on Independence Day 1976. Due to a lack of publicity and convenient parking, the National Visitor Center was never popular. Financial considerations caused the National Park Service to close the theaters, end the slideshow presentation in &quot;the Pit&quot;, and lay off almost three-quarters of the center&#x27;s staff on October 28, 1978.

During this time a replacement station for Amtrak had been built behind the Union Station concourse and under a parking garage. Two traffic lanes were planned but were actually only wide enough for 1-1/2 lanes. On observing its low ceiling and plastic chairs &quot;New Yorker&quot; magazine editor E. M. Frimbo described it as &quot;...a bad small town bus terminal.&quot; Train passengers had to walk 1,900 feet from the front door to the tracks. The most common question asked at the Visitor Center was, &quot;Where are the trains?&quot;

After the leaking roof caused the partial collapse of plaster from the ceiling in the eastern wing of the building, the National Park Service declared the entire structure unsafe on February 23, 1981, and sealed the structure to the public.

==== Restoration ====
The 1981 ceiling collapse deeply alarmed members of Congress and officials in the new Reagan administration. On April 3, despite a budget austerity push, administration officials proposed a plan to appropriate $7 million (equivalent to $ in ) to allow the Department of the Interior to finish its authorized $8 million (equivalent to $ in ) roof repair program. In addition, the government of the District of Columbia would be permitted to reprogram up to $40 million (equivalent to $ in ) in federal highway money to finish the parking garage at Union Station. On October 19, administration officials and members of the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation agreed on additional aspects of the plan. Up to $1 million (equivalent to $ in ) would be authorized and appropriated to fund a study on needed repairs at the station and a second study on the feasibility of turning Union Station into a retail complex. The Department of Transportation (DOT) was authorized to sign contracts with any willing corporation to construct a retail complex in and around Union Station. DOT was also authorized to spend up to $29 million (equivalent to $ in ) in already-appropriated money from its Northeast Corridor rail capital building program on Union Station repairs. The revised bill also required DOT to take control of Union Station from the Department of the Interior, and for DOT to buy out its lease with the station&#x27;s private-sector owners. The buy-out would be spread over six years, for which $275,000 a year (equivalent to $ in ) was authorized and appropriated. The bill required DOT to operate Union Station as a train station once more, complete with ticketing, waiting areas, baggage areas, and boarding. Although no statement was made in the bill, Senate aides said the intent was to have Amtrak tear down its 1960s-era station at the rear of Union Station and move its operations back inside. The Senate passed the bill unanimously on November 23. The House approved the bill on December 16. President Ronald Reagan signed the Union Station Redevelopment Act into law on December 29.

As a result of the Redevelopment Act of 1981, Union Station was closed for restoration and refurbishing. Mold was growing in the leaking ceiling of the Main Hall, and the carpet laid out for an Inauguration Day celebration was full of cigarette-burned holes. In 1988, Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole awarded $70 million (equivalent to $ in ) to the restoration effort. &quot;The Pit&quot; was transformed into a new basement level, and the Main Hall floor was refitted with marble. While installing new HVAC systems, crews discovered antique items in shafts that had not been opened since the building&#x27;s creation.

==== Remodel ====

The station reopened in its present form on September 29, 1988. The former &quot;Pit&quot; area was replaced with an AMC movie theater (later Phoenix Theatres), which closed on October 12, 2009, and was replaced with an expanded food court and a Walgreens store. The food court still retains the original arches under which the trains were parked as well as the track numbers on those arches. A variety of shops opened along the Concourse and Main Hall, and a new Amtrak terminal at the back behind the original Concourse. Trains no longer enter the original Concourse, but the original, decorative gates were relocated to the new passenger concourse. In 1994, this new passenger concourse was renamed to honor W. Graham Claytor Jr., who served as Amtrak&#x27;s president from 1982 to 1993. The decorative elements of the station were also restored. The skylights were preserved, but sunlight no longer illuminates the Concourse because it is blocked by the newer roof structure built directly overhead to support the aging, original structure.

=== 21st century ===
In July 2012, Amtrak announced a four-phase, $7 billion plan to revamp and renovate the station over 15 to 20 years. The proposed conversion would &quot;double the number of trains and triple the number of passengers in gleaming, glass-encased halls&quot;. Then-Amtrak President and CEO Joseph H. Boardman hoped the federal government would finance &quot;50 to 80 percent&quot; of the project.

In June 2015, the Union Station Redevelopment Corporation released a Historic Preservation Plan to guide preservation and restoration at the station complex.

==== A new decline ====
The cinema closed in 2009, B. Smith&#x27;s restaurant and Barnes &amp; Noble in 2013, and the latter&#x27;s replacement, H&amp;M, in 2019.

Amtrak moved its headquarters offices from Union Station to a nearby building in 2017. That same year, the Trump administration listed an $8.7 billion expansion and refurbishment of Washington Union Station as an infrastructure funding priority. In the early 2020s, the station saw a further decline in the number of restaurants and stores as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

&quot;A once-thriving terminal is now filled with vacant storefronts,&quot; the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported in 2022. &quot;Union Station had as many as 100 stores more than two decades ago. It’s down to about 40 retailers and eateries while more than half its commercial space sits vacant.&quot; The station continued to wrestle with issues stemming from homeless people camped around the station and relying on its waiting and restroom facilities. Columbus Circle has been rebuilt to fix its deteriorated roadbed, adjust the passenger pickup/dropoff locations, streamline the taxi stand, and better accommodate tour buses.

==== Renovation plans ====
In April 2022, Amtrak began condemnation proceedings to take over the leasehold interest, saying that “poor maintenance and lack of capital investment” had “plagued” the station for years. In the meantime, the agency described plans for a major renovation and expansion, which seek to triple passenger capacity and double train capacity by modernizing and expanding station facilities over 20 years. The &quot;Second Century Plan&quot; accommodates Burnham Place, a planned transit-oriented, three million square-foot mixed-use development over the existing rail yard, that will connect the station complex to the burgeoning neighborhoods of NoMa and the H Street Corridor. The plan cleared a regulatory obstacle in March 2024, when the Federal Railroad Administration completed its final environmental impact statement.

On April 17, 2024, U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Amtrak could seize the station’s commercial space through eminent domain, with the price to be set later. Officials said the renovation could start as early as 2027. Amtrak took over control of Union Station in late July 2024. Though Amtrak agreed to pay $505 million for the station&#x27;s leasehold in February 2025, the station&#x27;s former operator USSM sued to prevent the agreement from being approved.

==Architecture==

Architect Daniel H. Burnham, assisted by Pierce Anderson, was inspired by a number of architectural styles. Classical elements included the Arch of Constantine (exterior, main façade) and the great vaulted spaces of the Baths of Diocletian (interior); prominent siting at the intersection of two of Pierre (Peter) Charles L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s avenues, with an orientation that faced the United States Capitol just five blocks away; a massive scale, including a façade stretching more than and a waiting room ceiling above the floor; stone inscriptions and allegorical sculpture in the Beaux-Arts style; expensive materials such as marble, gold leaf and white granite from a previously unused quarry.

In the Attic block, above the main cornice of the central block, stand six colossal statues (modeled on the Dacian prisoners of the Arch of Constantine) created by Louis St. Gaudens. These are entitled &quot;The Progress of Railroading&quot; and their iconography expresses the confident enthusiasm of the American Renaissance movement:
* Prometheus (for Fire)
* Thales (for Electricity)
* Themis (for Freedom and Justice)
* Apollo (for Imagination and Inspiration)
* Ceres (for Agriculture) 
* Archimedes (for Mechanics)
The substitution of Agriculture for Commerce in a railroad station iconography vividly conveys the power of a specifically American lobbying bloc.

St. Gaudens also created the 26 centurions for the station&#x27;s main hall. 
The massive plaster statues which were modelled after ancient Roman soldiers, are also called Legionnaires and symbolically, they are a protective force, guarding over all who travel through the halls of Union Station.

Burnham drew upon a tradition, launched with the 1837 Euston railway station in London, of treating the entrance to a major terminal as a triumphal arch. He linked the monumental end pavilions with long arcades enclosing loggias in a long series of bays that were vaulted with the lightweight fireproof Guastavino tiles favored by American Beaux-Arts architects. The final aspect owed much to the Court of Heroes at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, where Burnham had been coordinating architect. The setting of Union Station&#x27;s façade at the focus of converging avenues in a park-like green setting is one of the few executed achievements of the City Beautiful movement: elite city planning that was based on the &quot;goosefoot&quot; (&quot;patte d&#x27;oie&quot;) of formal garden plans made by Baroque designers such as André Le Nôtre.

The station held a full range of dining rooms and other services, including barber shops and a mortuary. Union Station was equipped with a presidential suite which is now occupied by a restaurant.

==Services==
=== Trains ===
Union Station is served by Amtrak&#x27;s high-speed &quot;Acela Express&quot;, &quot;Northeast Regional&quot;, and several of Amtrak&#x27;s long-distance trains (including, among others, the &quot;Floridian&quot;, &quot;Crescent&quot;, and &quot;Silver Service&quot; trains). From Union Station, Amtrak also operates long-distance service to the Southeast and Midwest, including many intermediate stops to destinations such as Chicago, Charlotte, New Orleans, and Miami. In fiscal 2011, an average of more than 13,000 passengers boarded or got off Amtrak trains each day. It is also the busiest station that can handle the railroad&#x27;s Superliner railcars; inadequate tunnel clearances in Baltimore and New York preclude the use of Superliners on most Eastern routes.

The station is the terminus for commuter railways that link Washington to Maryland and West Virginia (MARC) and Northern Virginia (Virginia Railway Express). 

The station&#x27;s tracks are split between a ground level and a lower level. The ground level contains tracks 7–20 (tracks 1–6 no longer exist), which are served by high-level bay platforms at the door level of most trains. These tracks are used by all MARC commuter rail services, all Amtrak &quot;Acela Express&quot; trains, the Amtrak &quot;Capitol Limited,&quot; and Amtrak &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; trains that terminate at the station. All of the tracks on this level terminate at the station and are only used by trains arriving from and departing to the north.

The lower level contains tracks 22–29, which are served by low-level platforms at the track level. These platforms are served by all VRE trains, all Amtrak long-distance trains that serve the station except for the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot;, and Amtrak &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; trains that continue south to Virginia. Unlike the tracks on the upper level, the lower level tracks run through under the station building and Capitol Hill via the First Street tunnel. Electrification ends at the station, and all trains continuing south through the tunnel must have their electric engines swapped out for diesel locomotives. For example, when a southbound &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; train arrives on a lower-level platform on its way to Newport News, Virginia, its Siemens ACS-64 electric engine is removed and set aside. A GE Genesis diesel engine that was earlier removed from a northbound train is coupled to the front of the southbound, and it continues through the tunnel toward Virginia. The ACS-64 is readied for a &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; arriving from Alexandria, and once coupled pulls the train toward Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York or Boston.

=== Transit ===

A nearby Washington Metro station connects to the Red Line. The Metrorail station is underground beneath the western side of the building. Entrances are inside Union Station with direct access from the high-level MARC and Amtrak platforms, from the east side of First Street NE, or from just outside the station at Massachusetts Avenue NE, providing access to the main concourse.

Buses of the Georgetown-Union Station route of the DC Circulator system stop within the facility every ten minutes during operating hours.

 The DC Streetcar&#x27;s H Street/Benning Road Line serves the station from a stop on the H Street Bridge (a.k.a. the &quot;Hopscotch Bridge&quot;) directly north of the station. The stop is accessible via the station&#x27;s parking garage.

=== Intercity buses ===
On August 1, 2011, John Porcari, the United States Deputy Secretary of Transportation, announced that Greyhound Lines, BoltBus, Megabus, and Washington Deluxe would begin operating intercity buses later that year from a new bus facility in the station&#x27;s parking garage. By November 15, 2011, BoltBus, Megabus, Tripper Bus, and Washington Deluxe were operating from the new facility. On September 26, 2012, Greyhound and Peter Pan Bus Lines moved all of their Washington, D.C., operations to the facility. In 2017, OurBus began offering service from Union Station to Maryland, New Jersey, and New York. On August 16, 2024, Megabus discontinued service nationwide after the parent company filed for bankruptcy earlier in the year, prompting Peter Pan to take over the former&#x27;s northeastern bus routes from Union Station.

=== Maintenance ===
The Ivy City Yard, just north of Union Station, houses a large Amtrak maintenance facility. This includes the new maintenance facility for the &quot;Acela&quot; high-speed train sets. Amtrak also does contract work for MARC&#x27;s electric locomotives. Metro&#x27;s Brentwood maintenance facility is also in the southwest corner of the Ivy City Yard. Riders on the Metro Red Line between Union Station and Rhode Island Avenue Station get an aerial view of the south end of the Ivy City Yard.

==Owner==
Union Station is owned by Amtrak and the United States Department of Transportation. The DOT owns the station building itself and the surrounding parking lots, while Amtrak owns the platforms and tracks through the Washington Terminal Company: a nearly wholly-owned subsidiary (99.9% controlling interest).

The non-profit Union Station Redevelopment Corporation managed the station on behalf of the owners, but an 84-year lease of the property is held by New York-based Ashkenazy Acquisition Corporation and managed by Chicago-based Jones Lang LaSalle.

==In popular culture==
Washington Union Station has appeared in several movies and television shows. Among them are &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939), &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (1951), &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up the Ship&quot; (1959), &quot;Hannibal&quot; (2001), &quot;Collateral Damage&quot; (2002), and &quot;Head of State&quot; (2003).

<text>Icelandic names are names used by people from Iceland. Icelandic surnames are different from most other naming systems in the modern Western world in that they are patronymic or occasionally matronymic: they indicate the father (or mother) of the child and not the historic family lineage. Iceland shares a common cultural heritage with the Scandinavian countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Unlike these countries, Icelanders have continued to use their traditional name system, which was formerly used in most of Northern Europe. The Icelandic system is thus not based on family names (although some people do have family names and might use both systems). Generally, a person&#x27;s last name indicates the first name of their father (patronymic) or in some cases mother (matronymic) in the genitive, followed by (&quot;son&quot;) or (&quot;daughter&quot;).

Some family names exist in Iceland, most commonly adaptations from last names Icelanders adopted when living abroad, usually in Denmark. Notable Icelanders with inherited family names include former prime minister Geir Haarde, football star Eiður Smári Guðjohnsen, entrepreneur Magnús Scheving, film director Baltasar Kormákur Samper, and actress Anita Briem. Before 1925, it was legal to adopt new family names; one Icelander to do so was the Nobel Prize-winning author Halldór Laxness, while another author, Einar Hjörleifsson, and his brothers chose the family name &quot;Kvaran&quot;. Since 1925, it has been illegal for Icelanders to adopt a family name unless they have a right to do so through inheritance.

First names not previously used in Iceland must be approved by the Icelandic Naming Committee. The criterion for acceptance is whether a name can easily be incorporated into the Icelandic language. With some exceptions, it must contain only letters found in the Icelandic alphabet (including þ and ð), and it must be possible to decline the name according to the language&#x27;s grammatical case system, which in practice means that a genitive form can be constructed in accordance with Icelandic rules. Names considered to be gender-nonconforming were historically not allowed, but in 2013, a 15-year-old girl named Blær (a masculine noun in Icelandic) was allowed to keep her name in a court decision that overruled an initial rejection by the naming committee. Her mother, Björk Eiðsdóttir, did not realize at the time that &quot;Blær&quot; was considered masculine; she had read Halldór Laxness&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fish Can Sing&quot;, which has a female character named Blær, meaning &quot;light breeze&quot;, and decided that if she had a daughter, she would name her Blær.

In 2019, the laws governing names were changed. First names are no longer restricted by gender. Moreover, Icelanders who are officially registered as nonbinary are permitted to use the patro- and matronymic suffix (&quot;child of&quot;) instead of or .

==Typical Icelandic naming==

A man named &quot;Jón Einarsson&quot; has a son named &quot;Ólafur&quot;. Ólafur&#x27;s last name will not be &quot;Einarsson&quot; like his father&#x27;s; it will be &quot;Jónsson&quot;, indicating that &quot;Ólafur&quot; is the son of &quot;Jón&quot; (Jóns + son). The same practice is used for daughters. Jón Einarsson&#x27;s daughter &quot;Sigríður&quot;&#x27;s last name is not &quot;Einarsson&quot; but &quot;Jónsdóttir&quot;. Again, the name means &quot;Jón&#x27;s daughter&quot; (Jóns + dóttir).

In some cases, a person&#x27;s surname is derived from their parent&#x27;s second given name instead of the first. For example, if Jón is the son of Hjálmar Arnar Vilhjálmsson, he may either be named Jón Hjálmarsson (Jón, son of Hjálmar) or Jón Arnarsson (Jón, son of Arnar). The reason for this may be that the parent prefers to be called by the second given name instead of the first; this is fairly common. It may also be that the parent&#x27;s second name seems to fit the child&#x27;s first name better.

In cases where two people in the same social circle bear the same first name and the same father&#x27;s name, they have traditionally been distinguished by their paternal grandfather&#x27;s name (avonymic), e.g. Jón Þórsson Bjarnasonar (Jón, son of Þór, son of Bjarni) and Jón Þórsson Hallssonar (Jón, son of Þór, son of Hallur). This practice has become less common (the use of middle names having replaced it), but features conspicuously in the Icelandic sagas.

==Matronymic naming as a choice==
The vast majority of Icelandic last names carry the name of the father, but occasionally the mother&#x27;s name is used: e.g. if the child or mother wishes to end social ties with the father. Some women use it as a social statement while others simply choose it as a matter of style.

In all of these cases, the convention is the same: Ólafur, the son of Bryndís, will have the full name Ólafur Bryndísarson (&quot;son of Bryndís&quot;). Some well-known Icelanders with matronymic names are the football player Heiðar Helguson (&quot;Helga&#x27;s son&quot;), the novelist Guðrún Eva Mínervudóttir (&quot;Minerva&#x27;s daughter&quot;), and the medieval poet Eilífr Goðrúnarson (&quot;Goðrún&#x27;s son&quot;).

In the Icelandic film &quot;Bjarnfreðarson&quot; the title character&#x27;s name is the subject of some mockery for his having a matronymic – as Bjarnfreður&#x27;s son – rather than a patronymic. In the film this is connected to the mother&#x27;s radical feminism and shame over his paternity, which are part of the film&#x27;s plot. Some people have both a matronymic and a patronymic, such as Dagur Bergþóruson Eggertsson (&quot;the son of Bergþóra and Eggert&quot;), the mayor of Reykjavík since 2014. Another example is the girl Blær mentioned above: her full name is Blær Bjarkardóttir Rúnarsdóttir (&quot;the daughter of Björk and Rúnar&quot;).

Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk had a daughter in 2002 with American contemporary artist and filmmaker Matthew Barney. The pair named her Ísadóra Bjarkardóttir Barney, giving her two last names of different origin: &quot;Barney&quot;, her father&#x27;s last name (following the Western tradition of giving a child their father&#x27;s last name, usually a collective family name), and &quot;Bjarkardóttir&quot;, a conventional Icelandic matronymic.

==Gender-neutral patronymics and matronymics==
A gender autonomy act the Icelandic Parliament approved in 2019 allows people who register their gender as non-binary to use &quot;bur&quot;, a poetic word for &quot;son&quot;, to be repurposed as a neuter suffix instead of &quot;son&quot; or &quot;dóttir&quot;.

== History ==
Unlike the other Nordic countries, Iceland never formalized a system of family names. A growing number of Icelanders—primarily those who had studied abroad—began to adopt family names in the second half of the 19th century. In 1855, there were 108 family names. In 1910 there were 297. In 1913, the Althing legalized the adoption of family names. Icelanders who had family names tended to be upper-class and serve as government officials.

In 1925, Althing banned the adoption of new family names. Some common arguments against using family names were that they were not authentically &quot;Icelandic&quot;; that the usage of -son in family names made it unclear whether the name was a family name or patronymic; and that low-class people could adopt the family names of well-known upper-class families. Some common arguments for using family names were that they made it easier to trace lineages and to distinguish individuals (a problem in mid-19th century Iceland was that there were so many people named Jón—in fact, one in six Icelandic males were named Jón at the time) and that Iceland ought to follow the lead of its Nordic neighbours.

In Russia, where name-patronyms of similar style were historically used (such as &quot;Ivan Petrovich&quot; which means &quot;Ivan, the son of Peter&quot;), the much larger population necessitated family names, relegating the patronymic to a middle name and conversational honorific.

==Cultural ramifications==

In Iceland, listings such as the telephone directory are alphabetised by first name rather than surname. To reduce ambiguity, the directory also lists professions.

Icelanders formally address others by their first names. By way of example, the former prime minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir would not be introduced as &#x27;Ms Sigurðardóttir&#x27; but by either her first name or her full name, and usually addressed by her first name only. Icelandic singer Björk goes by her first name (her full name is Björk Guðmundsdóttir). &quot;Björk&quot; is how any Icelander would address her, whether formally or casually.

In the case of two people in the same group having the same given name, perhaps one named Jón Stefánsson and the other Jón Þorláksson, one could address Jón Stefánsson as &quot;Jón Stefáns&quot; and Jón Þorláksson as &quot;Jón Þorláks&quot;. When someone has a conversation with two such people at the same time, &quot;son&quot; need not be used; in that case, the genitive form of the father&#x27;s name could be used like a nickname, although it is just as common in such cases to refer to people by their middle names (having a middle name being nowadays the general rule for people with a common name like &#x27;Jón&#x27;).

Because the vast majority of Icelanders use patronymics, a family will normally have a variety of last names: the children of (married or unmarried) parents Jón Einarsson and Bryndís Atladóttir could be named Ólafur Jónsson and Katrín Jónsdóttir. With matronymics, the children in this example would be Ólafur Bryndísarson and Katrín Bryndísardóttir. Patronymics thus have the formula (genitive case of father&#x27;s name, usually adding &quot;-s&quot;, or if the name ends in &quot;-i&quot;, it will change to &quot;-a&quot;) + &quot;son/dóttir/bur&quot;, while matronymics are (genitive case of mother&#x27;s name, often &quot;-ar&quot;, or if the name ends in &quot;-a&quot;, it will change to &quot;-u&quot;) + &quot;son/dóttir/bur&quot;.

===Outside of Iceland===
The Icelandic naming system occasionally causes problems for families travelling abroad, especially with young children, since non-Icelandic immigration staff (apart from those of other Nordic countries) are usually unfamiliar with the practice and therefore expect children to have the same last names as that of their parents.

Icelandic footballers who work abroad may also be called by their patronymics, even though that is improper from an Icelandic standpoint. Aron Gunnarsson, for example, wore the name &quot;Gunnarsson&quot; on the back of his shirt in the Premier League before his move to Al-Arabi, and was referred to as such by the British media and commentators.

Television presenter Magnus Magnusson acquired his name when his parents adopted British naming conventions while living in the United Kingdom, taking Magnus&#x27;s father&#x27;s patronymic as a surname. Magnus had been named Magnús Sigursteinsson at birth.

Expatriate Icelanders or people of Icelandic descent who live in foreign countries, such as the significant Icelandic community in Manitoba, Canada, usually abandon the traditional Icelandic naming system. In most cases, they adopt the naming convention of their country of residence—most commonly by retaining the patronymic of their first ancestor to immigrate to the new country as a permanent family surname, much as other Nordic immigrants did before surnames became fully established in their own countries. Alternatively, a permanent family surname may sometimes be chosen to represent the family&#x27;s geographic rather than patronymic roots; for example, Canadian musician Lindy Vopnfjörð&#x27;s grandfather immigrated to Canada from the Icelandic village of Vopnafjörður.

<text>William Phillips FGS FRS (10 May 17752 April 1828) was an English mineralogist and geologist.

==Biography==
Phillips was the son of James Phillips, printer and bookseller in London. He became interested in mineralogy and geology and was one of the founders of the Geological Society of London (1807). The foundation of the Geological society came about through a series of business meetings, some held in Phillips&#x27; house in London, by a group of mineral enthusiasts who wished to finance the publication of a treatise on mineralogy by Louis de Bournon; Phillips was to be the publisher. His &quot;Outlines of Mineralogy and Geology&quot; (1815) and &quot;Elementary Introduction to the Knowledge of Mineralogy&quot; (1816) became standard textbooks.

His digest of English geology, &quot;A selection of Facts from the Best Authorities, arranged so as to form an Outline of the Geology of England and Wales&quot; (1818), formed the foundation of the larger work undertaken by Phillips in conjunction with William Conybeare, of which only the first part was published, entitled &quot;Outlines of the Geology of England and Wales&quot; (1822). This book had a major influence on the development of geology in Britain. In this work Phillips reprinted his description of the chalk cliffs of Dover and other parts of East Kent. Phillips was a member of the Religious Society of Friends. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1827.

In 1796 he and his brother Richard, together with William Allen and Luke Howard, took part in forming the Askesian Society. The zeolite mineral phillipsite is named for him.

<text>An integer programming problem is a mathematical optimization or feasibility program in which some or all of the variables are restricted to be integers. In many settings the term refers to integer [[linear programming]] (ILP), in which the objective function and the constraints (other than the integer constraints) are linear.

Integer programming is NP-complete. In particular, the special case of 0–1 integer linear programming, in which unknowns are binary, and only the restrictions must be satisfied, is one of Karp&#x27;s 21 NP-complete problems.

If some decision variables are not discrete, the problem is known as a mixed-integer programming problem.

==Canonical and standard form for ILPs==

In integer linear programming, the &quot;canonical form&quot; is distinct from the &quot;standard form&quot;. An integer linear program in canonical form is expressed thus (note that it is the formula_1 vector which is to be decided):

:formula_2

and an ILP in standard form is expressed as

:formula_3
where formula_4 are vectors and formula_5 is a matrix. As with linear programs, ILPs not in standard form can be converted to standard form by eliminating inequalities, introducing slack variables (formula_6) and replacing variables that are not sign-constrained with the difference of two sign-constrained variables.

==Example==

The plot on the right shows the following problem.

:formula_7

The feasible integer points are shown in red, and the red dashed lines indicate their convex hull, which is the smallest convex polyhedron that contains all of these points. The blue lines together with the coordinate axes define the polyhedron of the LP relaxation, which is given by the inequalities without the integrality constraint. The goal of the optimization is to move the black dashed line as far upward while still touching the polyhedron. The optimal solutions of the integer problem are the points formula_8 and formula_9 that both have an objective value of 2. The unique optimum of the relaxation is formula_10 with objective value of 2.8. If the solution of the relaxation is rounded to the nearest integers, it is not feasible for the ILP.

==Proof of NP-hardness==

The following is a reduction from minimum vertex cover to integer programming that will serve as the proof of NP-hardness.

Let formula_11 be an undirected graph. Define a linear program as follows:

:formula_12

Given that the constraints limit formula_13 to either 0 or 1, any feasible solution to the integer program is a subset of vertices. The first constraint implies that at least one end point of every edge is included in this subset. Therefore, the solution describes a vertex cover. Additionally given some vertex cover C, formula_13 can be set to 1 for any formula_15 and to 0 for any formula_16 thus giving us a feasible solution to the integer program. Thus we can conclude that if we minimize the sum of formula_13 we have also found the minimum vertex cover.

==Variants==
Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) involves problems in which only some of the variables, formula_18, are constrained to be integers, while other variables are allowed to be non-integers.

Zero–one linear programming (or binary integer programming) involves problems in which the variables are restricted to be either 0 or 1. Any bounded integer variable can be expressed as a combination of binary variables. For example, given an integer variable, formula_19, the variable can be expressed using formula_20 binary variables:
:formula_21

==Applications==

There are two main reasons for using integer variables when modeling problems as a linear program:
#The integer variables represent quantities that can only be integer. For example, it is not possible to build 3.7 cars.
#The integer variables represent decisions (e.g. whether to include an edge in a graph) and so should only take on the value 0 or 1.
These considerations occur frequently in practice and so integer linear programming can be used in many applications areas, some of which are briefly described below.

===Production planning===
Mixed-integer programming has many applications in industrial productions, including job-shop modelling. One important example happens in agricultural production planning and involves determining production yield for several crops that can share resources (e.g. land, labor, capital, seeds, fertilizer, etc.). A possible objective is to maximize the total production, without exceeding the available resources. In some cases, this can be expressed in terms of a linear program, but the variables must be constrained to be integer.

===Scheduling===

These problems involve service and vehicle scheduling in transportation networks. For example, a problem may involve assigning buses or subways to individual routes so that a timetable can be met, and also to equip them with drivers. Here binary decision variables indicate whether a bus or subway is assigned to a route and whether a driver is assigned to a particular train or subway. The zero–one programming technique has been successfully applied to solve a project selection problem in which projects are mutually exclusive and/or technologically interdependent. It is used in a special case of integer programming, in which all the decision variables are integers. Variable can assume only the values zero or one.

===Territorial partitioning===

Territorial partitioning or districting problems consist of partitioning a geographical region into districts in order to plan some operations while considering different criteria or constraints. Some requirements for this problem are: contiguity, compactness, balance or equity, respect of natural boundaries, and socio-economic homogeneity. Some applications for this type of problem include: political districting, school districting, health services districting and waste management districting.

===Telecommunications networks===

The goal of these problems is to design a network of lines to install so that a predefined set of communication requirements are met and the total cost of the network is minimal. This requires optimizing both the topology of the network along with setting the capacities of the various lines. In many cases, the capacities are constrained to be integer quantities. Usually there are, depending on the technology used, additional restrictions that can be modeled as linear inequalities with integer or binary variables.

===Cellular networks===
The task of frequency planning in GSM mobile networks involves distributing available frequencies across the antennas so that users can be served and interference is minimized between the antennas. This problem can be formulated as an integer linear program in which binary variables indicate whether a frequency is assigned to an antenna.

=== Other applications ===

* Cash flow matching
* Energy system optimization
* UAV guidance
* Transit map layouting

==Algorithms==

The naive way to solve an ILP is to simply remove the constraint that x is integer, solve the corresponding LP (called the LP relaxation of the ILP), and then round the entries of the solution to the LP relaxation. But, not only may this solution not be optimal, it may not even be feasible; that is, it may violate some constraint.

===Using total unimodularity===

While in general the solution to LP relaxation will not be guaranteed to be integral, if the ILP has the form formula_22 such that formula_23 where formula_24 and formula_25 have all integer entries and formula_24 is totally unimodular, then every basic feasible solution is integral. Consequently, the solution returned by the simplex algorithm is guaranteed to be integral. To show that every basic feasible solution is integral, let formula_1 be an arbitrary basic feasible solution . Since formula_1 is feasible,
we know that formula_29. Let formula_30 be the elements corresponding to the basis columns for the basic solution formula_1. By definition of a basis, there is some square submatrix formula_32 of
formula_24 with linearly independent columns such that formula_34.

Since the columns of formula_32 are linearly independent and formula_32 is square, formula_32 is nonsingular,
and therefore by assumption, formula_32 is unimodular and so formula_39. Also, since formula_32 is nonsingular, it is invertible and therefore formula_41. By definition, formula_42. Here formula_43 denotes the adjugate of formula_32 and is integral because formula_32 is integral. Therefore,
formula_46
Thus, if the matrix formula_24 of an ILP is totally unimodular, rather than use an ILP algorithm, the simplex method can be used to solve the LP relaxation and the solution will be integer.

===Exact algorithms===
When the matrix formula_24 is not totally unimodular, there are a variety of algorithms that can be used to solve integer linear programs exactly. One class of algorithms are cutting plane methods, which work by solving the LP relaxation and then adding linear constraints that drive the solution towards being integer without excluding any integer feasible points.

Another class of algorithms are variants of the branch and bound method. For example, the branch and cut method that combines both branch and bound and cutting plane methods. Branch and bound algorithms have a number of advantages over algorithms that only use cutting planes. One advantage is that the algorithms can be terminated early and as long as at least one integral solution has been found, a feasible, although not necessarily optimal, solution can be returned. Further, the solutions of the LP relaxations can be used to provide a worst-case estimate of how far from optimality the returned solution is. Finally, branch and bound methods can be used to return multiple optimal solutions.

=== Exact algorithms for a small number of variables ===
Suppose formula_24 is an &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; integer matrix and formula_25 is an &quot;m&quot;-by-1 integer vector. We focus on the feasibility problem, which is to decide whether there exists an &quot;n&quot;-by-1 vector formula_1 satisfying formula_52.

Let &quot;V&quot; be the maximum absolute value of the coefficients in formula_24 and formula_25. If &quot;n&quot; (the number of variables) is a fixed constant, then the feasibility problem can be solved in time polynomial in &quot;m&quot; and log &quot;V&quot;. This is trivial for the case &quot;n&quot;=1. The case &quot;n&quot;=2 was solved in 1981 by Herbert Scarf. The general case was solved in 1983 by Hendrik Lenstra, combining ideas by László Lovász and Peter van Emde Boas. Doignon&#x27;s theorem asserts that an integer program is feasible whenever every subset of formula_55 constraints is feasible; a method combining this result with algorithms for LP-type problems can be used to solve integer programs in time that is linear in formula_56 and fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) in &quot;formula_57&quot;, but possibly doubly exponential in formula_57, with no dependence on formula_59.

In the special case of 0-1 ILP, Lenstra&#x27;s algorithm is equivalent to complete enumeration: the number of all possible solutions is fixed (2&quot;n&quot;), and checking the feasibility of each solution can be done in time poly(&quot;m&quot;, log &quot;V&quot;). In the general case, where each variable can be an arbitrary integer, complete enumeration is impossible. Here, Lenstra&#x27;s algorithm uses ideas from Geometry of numbers. It transforms the original problem into an equivalent one with the following property: either the existence of a solution formula_1 is obvious, or the value of formula_61 (the &quot;n&quot;-th variable) belongs to an interval whose length is bounded by a function of &quot;n&quot;. In the latter case, the problem is reduced to a bounded number of lower-dimensional problems. The run-time complexity of the algorithm has been improved in several steps:

* The original algorithm of Lenstra had run-time formula_62.
* Kannan presented an improved algorithm with run-time formula_63.
* Frank and Tardos presented an improved algorithm with run-time formula_64.
* Dadush presented an improved algorithm with run-time formula_65.
* Reis and Rothvoss presented an improved algorithm with run-time formula_66.
These algorithms can also be used for mixed integer linear programs (MILP) - programs in which some variables are integer and some variables are real. The original algorithm of Lenstra has run-time formula_67, where n is the number of integer variables, d is the number of continuous variables, and &quot;L&quot; is the binary encoding size of the problem. Using techniques from later algorithms, the factor formula_68 can be improved to formula_69 or to formula_70.

===Heuristic methods===
Since integer linear programming is NP-hard, many problem instances are intractable and so heuristic methods must be used instead. For example, tabu search can be used to search for solutions to ILPs. To use tabu search to solve ILPs, moves can be defined as incrementing or decrementing an integer constrained variable of a feasible solution while keeping all other integer-constrained variables constant. The unrestricted variables are then solved for. Short-term memory can consist of previously tried solutions while medium-term memory can consist of values for the integer constrained variables that have resulted in high objective values (assuming the ILP is a maximization problem). Finally, long-term memory can guide the search towards integer values that have not previously been tried.

Other heuristic methods that can be applied to ILPs include
*Hill climbing
*Simulated annealing
*Reactive search optimization
*Ant colony optimization
*Hopfield neural networks

There are also a variety of other problem-specific heuristics, such as the k-opt heuristic for the traveling salesman problem. A disadvantage of heuristic methods is that if they fail to find a solution, it cannot be determined whether it is because there is no feasible solution or whether the algorithm simply was unable to find one. Further, it is usually impossible to quantify how close to optimal a solution returned by these methods are.

== Sparse integer programming ==
It is often the case that the matrix formula_24 that defines the integer program is &quot;sparse&quot;. In particular, this occurs when the matrix has a block structure, which is the case in many applications. The sparsity of the matrix can be measured as follows. The &quot;graph&quot; of formula_24 has vertices corresponding to columns of formula_24, and two columns form an edge if formula_24 has a row where both columns have nonzero entries. Equivalently, the vertices correspond to variables, and two variables form an edge if they share an inequality. The &quot;sparsity measure&quot; formula_75 of formula_24 is the minimum of the tree-depth of the graph of formula_24 and the tree-depth of the graph of the transpose of formula_24. Let formula_79 be the &quot;numeric measure&quot; of formula_24 defined as the maximum absolute value of any entry of formula_24. Let formula_57 be the number of variables of the integer program. Then it was shown in 2018 that integer programming can be solved in strongly polynomial and fixed-parameter tractable time parameterized by formula_79 and formula_75. That is, for some computable function formula_85 and some constant formula_86, integer programming can be solved in time formula_87. In particular, the time is independent of the right-hand side formula_88 and objective function formula_89. Moreover, in contrast to the classical result of Lenstra, where the number formula_57 of variables is a parameter, here the number formula_57 of variables is a variable part of the input.

<text>The Malaysian Chinese Association (abbrev: MCA; Malay: &quot;Persatuan Cina Malaysia&quot;), formerly known as the Malayan Chinese Association, is an ethnic political party in Malaysia that seeks to represent the Malaysian Chinese ethnicity; it was one of the three original major component parties of the coalition party in Malaysia called the Alliance Party, which later became a broader coalition called Barisan Nasional in Malay, or National Front in English.

Along with the largest and third largest component party in BN, i.e. United Malays National Organisation and Malaysian Indian Congress, MCA has a significant influence over the political arena in Malaysia since its independence. Through its holding of companies such as Huaren Holdings, MCA controls &quot;The Star&quot;, which is Malaysia&#x27;s best-selling English newspaper.

The party was once the largest party representing the Chinese community in Malaysia, and was particularly dominant in the early period until the late 1960s. Its fortunes fluctuated after the establishment of other political parties in the 1960s that challenged it for the Chinese votes, although it still enjoyed strong support in the mid-1990s to mid-2000s period. However, it has performed poorly in elections since 2008, with the Malaysian Chinese community mostly voting for the Democratic Action Party and People&#x27;s Justice Party, and in the 2018 Malaysian general election, it lost all but one of its parliamentary seats and was relegated to the opposition. It returned to power in March 2020 as part of the alliance with Perikatan Nasional. After the 2022 election, the party joined the government as a backbencher with Barisan Nasional supporting Pakatan Harapan.

== History ==

=== Formation and early years ===
The Malayan Chinese Association was formed on 27 February 1949 with the implicit support by the post-World War II British colonial administration. A central purpose of the MCA at the time of its founding was to manage the specific social and welfare concerns of the populations interned in the so-called New Villages created under the Briggs Plan in response to the Malayan Emergency.

The declaration that announced the MCA as a formal political party in 1951 was written by a prominent Straits Chinese businessman, Tan Cheng Lock, its first president. In general, its early members were landowners, businessmen, or otherwise better off, while the working classes in the New Villages overwhelmingly joined the Socialist Front instead. Many prominent members of the MCA were also Kuomintang members opposed to the Malayan Communist Party. Leong Yew Koh, was a KMT major general who became a cabinet minister and later became governor of Malacca; Malaysia&#x27;s first minister of finance, Henry H.S. Lee, was a KMT colonel; and Lim Chong Eu, the leader of the Radical Party and joined the MCA in 1952, was a colonel (medical) doctor in the Kuomintang.

In 1952, MCA joined force with United Malays National Organisation on a local level to contest the Kuala Lumpur municipal elections which would lead to the formation of the Alliance Party. The alliance was joined by Malaysian Indian Congress in 1954 and they contested the first Malayan General Election in 1955 as one body, and the alliance won 51 of the 52 seat contested. MCA won all 15 of the seats allocated.

Tan Cheng Lock was succeeded by Lim Chong Eu after a successful challenge by Lim for the presidency in 1958. Lim attempted to amend the party&#x27;s Constitution to consolidate the power of the Central Committee, and although amendment was passed narrowly, it also split the party. Prior to the 1959 General Election, Lim pressed for an increase of the allocated number of seats from 28 to 40, but this was refused by UMNO leader Tunku Abdul Rahman. Lim was forced to back down and later resigned as president, with Cheah Toon Lock taking over as acting president. Other members also resigned from MCA to contest the election as independent candidates, which cost the party some seats. The party only won 19 of the 31 seats eventually allocated. Lim himself left the party in December 1960, later becoming one of the founding members of the opposition Gerakan in 1968. In 1961 Tan Siew Sin, son of Tan Cheng Lock and favoured by Tunku, became MCA&#x27;s third President. Tan led the party to a firm victory in the 1964 General Election, winning 27 of the 33 parliamentary seats contested. In 1969, Tan established Tunku Abdul Rahman College after a proposal for a Chinese-language university was turned down by the government.

===1969–1985 ===
The third Malaysian general elections were held on 10 May 1969. MCA faced strong challenges from the new, mainly Chinese, opposition parties Democratic Action Party and Gerakan. Of the 33 parliamentary seats contested, MCA managed to retain only 13. MCA also lost control of the Penang State Government to Gerakan. The gain by the opposition parties led to tension between different communities which erupted into the May 13 Riots. Prior to the riots, on 12 May 1969, Tan Siew Sin announced that the party would withdraw from the Alliance, but reconsidered on 20 May and joined the National Operations Council formed in place of the suspended Parliament after the riots. The loss of support for MCA among the Chinese population elicited a comment by the then Deputy Prime Minister Dr Ismail that if MCA continue to lose support, UMNO may stop co-operating with it. To regain Chinese support, Tan attempted to broaden the appeal of the party previously seen as a party of the &quot;taukeh&quot; (&quot;tou jia&quot;, rich men), and invited professionals to join the party. However, many of these were later expelled after a dispute involving Lim Keng Yaik who then joined Gerakan.

With the loss of support for MCA in the 1969 election, and the enlargement of the Alliance party in 1972 (which later became Barisan Nasional) to include Gerakan, UMNO became even more dominant and MCA suffered a loss of status within the coalition. In 1973, Tan Siew Sin requested a position as Deputy Prime Minister in the cabinet reshuffle following the death of Tun Dr. Ismail, but this was refused by Tun Abdul Razak, which angered Tan. On 8 April 1974, prior to the general election, Tan Siew Sin resigned all of his party and government posts for health reasons.
Lee San Choon took over as Acting President following Tan&#x27;s resignation, and was then elected president in 1975. After Tan&#x27;s resignation, the cabinet posts allocated to MCA declined in importance, and MCA lost both the Finance Ministry and Trade and Industry Ministry posts it once held in 1957. The party performed better in the 1974 election, but lost ground again in the following 1978 general election, with the MCA winning only 17 of the 28 parliamentary seats and 44 of the 60 state seats. In 1979, Michael Chen stood against Lee San Choon for the MCA Presidency but lost, and later in 1981 led a group of MCA dissidents to join Gerakan.

The 1982 general election however saw a shift in fortune for MCA. Lee accepted a challenge from the opposition Democratic Action Party which taunted the MCA&#x27;s leadership for not daring to contest a seat with large urban Chinese majority, and contested the parliamentary seat for Seremban against the incumbent DAP Chairman Chen Man Hin. Lee won his challenge, and led his party to a resounding victory, winning 24 out of 28 allocated parliamentary seats and 55 out of 62 state seats. After the success in the election and at the height of his career, Lee San Choon unexpectedly resigned his presidency and cabinet post for unspecified reason in 1983. Neo Yee Pan then led as Acting President until 1985.

=== 1985–2003 ===
In 1985, Tan Koon Swan, who was sacked from the party a year earlier, won the presidential election with the largest majority in the party&#x27;s history. However, in the following year, he was charged with abetting criminal breach of trust relating to his private business dealings in Singapore, and resigned from the presidency. Koon Swan also originated the Deposit-Taking Cooperatives, which sought to accumulate capital for Chinese Malaysians through investments. The mismanagement of the DTCs&#x27; funds led to a scandal, with the central bank, Bank Negara Malaysia, stepping in to freeze the assets of up to 35 DTCs. The total loss was estimated to be RM3.6 billion, and depositors could only recover 62% of their deposits.

Koon Swan was succeeded by his deputy Ling Liong Sik in 1986. He assumed the presidency when the party was still rife with factionalism and faced disillusionment with the Chinese community over the Deposit-Taking Cooperatives scandal. Ling spent his early years as president working to resolve MCA&#x27;s financial problems, raising funds while restructuring the party&#x27;s assets. Ling presided over a period of relative peace within the party, and worked to maintain the interests of the Chinese community through a closed-door approach within the government. He expanded the MCA-owned Tunku Abdul Rahman College through fund-raising and government contributions, and in 2001 set up Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman. Ling led MCA to its best electoral performance thus far in the 1995 general election, winning 30 of the 34 allocated parliamentary seats and 71 of the 77 state seats, and secured a majority of Chinese votes at the expense of DAP. MCA also performed well in the 1999 general elections, and the successive electoral victory boosted the party&#x27;s standing within the Barisan Nasional coalition as well as Ling&#x27;s personal relationship with BN leader and prime minister Mahathir Mohamad.

However, internal power struggles persisted. In 1993 Ling&#x27;s deputy Lee Kim Sai indicated that he would challenge Ling for the presidency, but withdrew at the eleventh hour. Lee eventually retired in 1996 and was replaced as deputy president by Lim Ah Lek. In 1999, the party was again wracked by factionalism. Deputy president Lim Ah Lek announced his intention to retire as a minister and agreed with Ling to nominate his protégé Chan Kong Choy to the Cabinet after the 1999 elections. However, Ling nominated his own protégé Ong Ka Ting as a minister at the expense of Chan, causing discontent with members aligned to Lim, which became known as &quot;Team B&quot; among party members. The Ling faction was known as &quot;Team A&quot;. Tensions flared further after MCA, through its holding company Huaren, moved to acquire the independent daily &quot;Nanyang Siang Pau&quot;. This was vehemently opposed by Team B, fearing a complete control of the Chinese media by Team A. They were joined by Chinese journalists and non-governmental organisations, who made their opposition public through demonstrations. The situation turned farcical when chairs were thrown during the 2001 Youth general assembly over the issue. Huaren eventually succeeded in taking over &quot;Nanyang Siang Pau&quot;. Huaren also controls &quot;The Star&quot; and &quot;China Press&quot;, and the domination of media press resulted in strong resentments in the divided party and concerns over press freedom.

Mahathir, as BN leader, eventually stepped in to resolve the conflict, suggesting a &quot;peace plan&quot; among the factions. The scheduled 2002 party elections were cancelled, while Ling and Lim stepped down to be replaced by their respective protégés.

=== 2003–2008 ===
In May 2003, the leadership transition occurred as planned. Ong Ka Ting, who was then a vice-president succeeded Ling Liong Sik as president, while Chan Kong Choy succeeded Lim Ah Lek as deputy president. The Ong-led MCA contributed to Barisan Nasional&#x27;s overwhelming victory in the 2004 general elections. MCA won 31 of the 40 parliamentary seats and 76 of the 90 state seats allocated. During the 2005 party elections, Teams A and B ran on a united front, easily quashing the challenge by vice-president Chua Jui Meng (for president) and secretary-general Ting Chew Peh (for deputy president).

The Ong-Chan leadership continued the soft approach to protecting the Chinese community&#x27;s interests, although tension with UMNO over racial issues flared up now and again after the 2004 election. In early 2008, vice-president and Health Minister Chua Soi Lek, a prominent Johor member, was involved in a sex scandal. DVDs of Chua having sex with a woman were circulated in Johor, prompting Chua to resign all his political positions, including as Member of Parliament. Chua suggested that his political enemies within the party who might have felt threatened by him for plotting his downfall.
In the March 2008 general elections, MCA fared badly, winning only 15 parliamentary seats and 32 state seats, less than half the number of seats they won in the previous election. Ong decided not to contest the presidency during the party elections later that year, to allow a new leader to take over. The October 2008 party election marked a realignment of the party&#x27;s factions, with the return of Chua Soi Lek to the fold. Ong Ka Ting&#x27;s anointed successor was vice-president Ong Tee Keat. Meanwhile, Chua entered the race for deputy president, facing among others, Ong Ka Chuan, the elder brother of Ka Ting. Ong Tee Keat won the presidency comfortably, while Chua edged out Ka Chuan. Following his victory, Tee Keat pledged reform and reaching out to more young voters to revive the party.

=== 2008–present ===
After the 2008 leadership change, factional infighting continued and the relationship between the Ong Tee Keat and Chua Soi Lek remained tense. Chua was sidelined by Ong from taking an active role in the party&#x27;s leadership, and he was also excluded from government posts. He was then sacked by MCA in August 2009 for damaging the party&#x27;s image with his sex scandal more than a year prior. In response, Chua&#x27;s supporters forced an extraordinary general meeting which passed a vote of no confidence against incumbent president Ong and annulled the expulsion of Chua. The EGM, however, failed to reinstate Chua as deputy president. Ong refused to resign despite the vote of no confidence, but pledged with Chua to set aside their differences under the &quot;greater unity plan.&quot; However, this was opposed by vice-president Liow Tiong Lai who demanded Ong step down and that new elections be held. This set in motion a new leadership crisis, which lasted almost six months.

Finally in March 2010, Chua, along with his supporters in the central committee resigned. Along with the resignations of Liow&#x27;s supporters in the CC, more than two-thirds of the CC had vacated their seats, paving the way for an election per the party constitution. The subsequent election saw Chua defeating incumbent Ong Tee Keat and former leader Ong Ka Ting in the race for president, while Liow defeated Kong Cho Ha in the contest for deputy president. Chua and his deputy Liow pledged to co-operate, and opened the party to non-Chinese.
MCA&#x27;s electoral performance meanwhile continued to deteriorate, as in the 2013 General Election, MCA only managed to score only 7 of the 37 parliamentary seats and 11 of the 90 state seats it contested, leading to calls for Chua&#x27;s resignation. The so-called &quot;Chinese tsunami&quot; where the great majority of Chinese votes went to the opposition was blamed by Najib Razak for the losses of the governing coalition. MCA&#x27;s poor performance in the two elections, along with continued factionalism, raised concerns over the party&#x27;s relevance in the Malaysian political arena. Also as a result of its poor performance, there was no MCA representation in the cabinet for the first time since independence due to a resolution that MCA would not accept cabinet posts if it performed badly in the general election.

Chua did not enter the following party poll for president, and in December 2013, Liow Tiong Lai was elected the president of MCA. Liow also reversed the resolution not to serve in the government and re-entered the cabinet.

In the 2018 election, MCA suffered its worst ever defeat, as it has lost all state seats it has contested, and only managed to retain one elected representative in the national parliament - Wee Ka Siong, who represents Ayer Hitam constituency in Johor. MCA, as part of the Barisan Nasional coalition, was also relegated to the opposition for the first time since independence. Wee Ka Siong was elected president on 4 November 2018 while Liow decided not to stand for party polls after his defeat. MCA later regained a seat in the 2019 Tanjung Piai by-election.

In March 2020, MCA returned to power as part of Barisan Nasional aligned to the Perikatan Nasional coalition after the collapse of the Pakatan Harapan government.

In the 2022 election, the Pakatan Harapan won the most seats but not the majority, and returned to government with the support of Barisan Nasional. MCA won two seats, however, it was not given any government cabinet posts and it stayed as a backbencher of the government.

<text>Salem College is a private women&#x27;s liberal arts college in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Founded in 1772 as a primary school, it later became an academy (high school) and ultimately added the college. It is the oldest female educational establishment that is still a women&#x27;s college and the oldest women&#x27;s college in the United States. 

Though Salem is regarded as a women&#x27;s college, men 23 years of age and over are admitted into the continuing education program through the Martha H. Fleer Center for Adult Education and into graduate-degree programs. Salem College is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges.

== History and campus ==
Located in the historic Moravian community of Salem, Salem College was originally a girls&#x27; school established by the Moravians, who believed strongly in equal education for men and women. On April 22, 1772, the Little Girls&#x27; School was founded. Sister Elisabeth Oesterlein, who travelled from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in 1766, at the age of 17, was hired as the first teacher. In its early years, the girls&#x27; school at Salem was led by the Single Sisters, the unmarried women of the Moravian community. The Single Sisters lived together and were economically self-sufficient, a rarity for women in the eighteenth century. It became a boarding school in 1802 and in 1866 it changed its name to the Salem Female Academy. The school began giving college diplomas in 1890. In 1907, the name was officially changed to Salem Academy and College and to this day both Salem Academy and Salem College share the campus adjacent to Old Salem.

Salem has an early history of accepting students from diverse backgrounds. Moravian records show that two enslaved African-American girls were accepted at Salem; Hanna, a ten-year-old entered the school in 1785, and Anna Maria Samuel attended the school and lived in the Single Sisters’ House from 1793 until 1795. In 1826, Sally Ridge, the daughter of Cherokee leader Major Ridge, became the first American Indian student at Salem. Jane Ross, the daughter of another Cherokee chief, was also a student, but she left Salem to join her family on the Trail of Tears in 1838.

The oldest building on Salem&#x27;s campus is the Single Sisters&#x27; House. Originally constructed in 1785, an addition was added in 1819. The Single Sisters&#x27; House is the oldest building in the United States dedicated to the education of women. Renovation on the Single Sisters&#x27; House began in October 2005, and was completed for a re-opening ceremony on April 22, 2007 - marking the 235th anniversary of the founding of Salem. In the fourth-floor attic of the Single Sister&#x27;s House is its original 1785 datestone. Several interesting features were found in the renovation process including graffiti that was covered by plaster. The building is featured in the children&#x27;s book &quot;Sister Maus,&quot; written and illustrated by Salem College Professor John Hutton. The story portrays a mouse as a stowaway on the trip from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, to living in the Single Sisters&#x27; House. The story was inspired by a mouse hole found in a baseboard of the foyer.

Salem has eight residence halls on campus. Alice Wolle Clewell is designated for first-year students. The additional residence halls are named South, Bahnson House, Hattie Strong, Louisa Wilson Bitting, Mary Reynolds Babcock and Dale H. Gramley. Each hall is named after someone who was important to the Salem community. In the Spring of 2014 the Student Center was completed to showcase the beautiful campus and be a hub for Salem&#x27;s student events and gatherings. The student center features a café, career center, theater, student lounge, meeting rooms and a student organizational workroom. Lambert Architecture + Interiors designed the project (built by Frank L. Blum Construction) to be modern and open while reflecting Salem&#x27;s historic roots. Located adjacent to Corrin Refectory and Bryant Hall, until the completion of a new residence hall in 2018, it was never used by the college though and would be sold to Winston-Salem State University in 2020 during a time of financial instability within the college.

From 1963 to 2018, the Salem campus housed one campus of the Governor&#x27;s School of North Carolina, a state-run summer program for gifted high school students.

== Academics ==
Salem College offers the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Bachelor of Science (B.S.), Bachelor of Music (B.M.), Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (B.S.B.A.), Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.), and Master of Education (M.Ed.).

On February 24, 2021, Salem College announced it would focus on preparing students in health leadership. According to the website, Salem College has transitioned to becoming &quot;The nation’s only college dedicated to elevating and expanding the role of women in health leadership.&quot;

Traditional-age students are required to complete an internship and service learning project as part of the Salem Impact general education program.

Salem College has a cross-registration relationship with Wake Forest University, in which Salem undergraduates may take classes at Wake Forest&#x27;s Reynolda Campus when a given course is not offered at Salem. (Similarly, Wake Forest undergraduates may enroll in Salem College courses when such a class is not available to them at Wake Forest.) Several Salem students are also members of Wake Forest&#x27;s marching band.

Salem offers graduate degrees in education, school counseling, and Piano Pedagogy plus add-on teaching licensures.

Salem College is home to the Salem College Center for Women Writers. The center sponsors workshops and lectures, and hosts an annual writing contest.

== Student life ==
, Salem College enrolled 469 students; this includes undergraduate students, graduate students in the field of education and adult continuing education students who live off-campus.

<doc id="411224" wikidata="Q672269" url="?curid=411224" title="Dave Weldon">
<text>David Joseph Weldon (born August 31, 1953) is an American politician and physician. He was a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives, representing , and was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination in Florida&#x27;s 2012 U.S. Senate race.

In November 2024, Donald Trump nominated Weldon as the next director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who requires Senate confirmation. His nomination has drawn attention for his promotion of the scientifically disproved claim of a causal link between vaccines and autism, critiques of federal health agencies and his emphasis on safeguarding personal freedoms in public health policy.

==Early life, education, and career==

Weldon was born in Amityville, New York on Long Island to Anna (née Mallardi) and David Joseph Weldon Sr. He graduated from Farmingdale High School in 1971 and Stony Brook University in 1978. He earned his M.D. degree at the University at Buffalo School of Medicine in 1981.

Weldon served in the United States Army from 1981 to 1987 and the United States Army Reserve from 1987 until 1992. He practiced as a physician in Florida after becoming an MD.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In the 1994 elections, Weldon decided to run in Florida&#x27;s 15th congressional district, vacated by Democratic U.S. congressman Jim Bacchus. He was one of seven Republicans to file for the primary. On September 8, he ranked first with 24% of the vote, but failed to reach the 50% threshold to win outright. In the October 4 run-off election, he defeated Carole Jean Jordan 54–46%. In the November general election, he defeated Democrat Sue Munsey 54–46%.

In 1996, he won re-election to a second term defeating John L. Byron 51–43%. In 1998, he won re-election to a third term with 63% of the vote. In 2000, he won re-election to a fourth term with 59% of the vote. In 2002, he won re-election to a fifth term with 63% of the vote. In 2004, he won re-election to a sixth term with 65% of the vote.

Former presidential candidate Bob Bowman, a Democrat, challenged Weldon in 2006. The incumbent raised significantly more campaign funds than Bowman. By the end of September, Weldon&#x27;s total was $673,321 versus $21,944 for Bowman. Weldon also refused to debate Bowman during the campaign. In the November election, Weldon received 125,596 votes to Bowman&#x27;s 97,947. Weldon won re-election to a seventh term with 56% of the vote.

On January 25, 2008, claiming &quot;He never wanted to be a career politician&quot;, Weldon announced he would not seek an eighth term and would be returning to his medical practice. He endorsed state senator Bill Posey to succeed him.

===Tenure===
In 2004, Weldon introduced the Weldon Amendment to an appropriations measure. The amendment prevents healthcare programs receiving federal funding from requiring healthcare entities (including doctors, hospitals, and health insurance plans) to provide, pay for, or refer for abortion services. This prevents patients from being informed about all of their care options and disregrads ethical standards for medical care. The amendment has been included in annual appropriations bills since 2005.

In response to the legal battle over the removal of the feeding tube of Terri Schiavo, Weldon introduced legislation to force review of the case by the federal government. Weldon, who has a medical degree, believed that Schiavo was not in a vegetative state. He supported his belief saying, &quot;She responds to verbal stimuli, she attempts to vocalize, she tracks with her eyes, she emotes, she attempts to kiss her father.&quot;

In December, 2005, Weldon joined with several other congressmen to form the Second Amendments, a rock and country band set to play for United States troops stationed overseas over the holiday season. Weldon plays the bass guitar.

During his tenure in Congress, Weldon promoted the disproven claim that thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative once used in some vaccines, was linked to an increase in autism. In 2007, he introduced legislation aimed at transferring vaccine safety oversight from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to an independent agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). He cited concerns about the integrity of the federal vaccine safety review process, stating there were conflicts of interest and inadequate research funding as reasons for introducing the bill. Weldon has publicly questioned the safety of specific vaccines, including the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and Gardasil, a vaccine that protects against certain strains of human papillomavirus (HPV).

Weldon was a vocal advocate for medical privacy rights, sponsoring legislation to limit government access to patient health records without consent.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Appropriations
**Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies
**Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs
*Committee on Science
*Committee on Education and the Workforce
*Committee on Banking and Currency
*Committee on Government Reform

===Caucus memberships===
*Republican Study Committee
*Congressional Aerospace Caucus (Co-founder and chair)
*Congressional Israel Allies Caucus (Co-founder and chair)

==2012 U.S. Senate election==
Weldon decided to run for the U.S. Senate in 2012 in the hope of facing Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson. His opponent in the Republican primary was U.S. representative Connie Mack IV. Weldon ran as a Christian conservative, and trailed Mack in both funding and name recognition. He lost the Republican primary with 20% of the vote, coming in second behind Mack&#x27;s 59%. Mack went on to lose the general election to Nelson, 42-55%.

==2024 Florida House of Representatives election==
Weldon ran for Florida&#x27;s 32nd House of Representatives district in 2024 against state senator Debbie Mayfield, losing the primary 35% to 65%.

==Post-politics==
Weldon has a medical practice at Health First Medical Group in Malabar, Florida.

In 2017, he became the president of the Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries, a trade group for Christian organizations that offered an alternative to traditional health insurance.

== CDC director ==
In November 2024, Donald Trump nominated Weldon as the next director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who requires Senate confirmation. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Secretary of Health and Human Services nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. proposed Weldon to the position. His nomination has drawn attention for his promotion of the scientifically disproved claim of a causal link between vaccines and autism, critiques of federal health agencies and his emphasis on safeguarding personal freedoms in public health policy. Anti-vaccine activists and groups celebrated his nomination.

== Views ==
Weldon has promoted the scientifically disproved claim of a causal link between vaccines and autism. In 2016, he appeared on the anti-vaccine movie Vaxxed; the moviemaker and anti-vaccine activist Andrew Wakefield touted Weldon as his ideal choice as the CDC director in Trump&#x27;s first presidency. In a 2019 appearance on a TV show broadcast by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, Weldon falsely claimed &quot;some children can get an autism spectrum disorder from a vaccine&quot;. Weldon has called himself a supporter of vaccines, and has voiced support of COVID-19 vaccines.

<doc id="411225" wikidata="Q723765" url="?curid=411225" title="Mark Foley">
<text>Mark Adam Foley (born September 8, 1954) is an American former politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives. He served from 1995 until 2006, representing the 16th District of Florida as a member of the Republican Party, before resigning due to revelations that he had sent sexually explicit messages to teenaged boys who had served as congressional pages in what came to be known as the Mark Foley scandal.

Foley resigned from Congress on September 29, 2006, acting on a request by the Republican leadership after allegations surfaced that he had sent suggestive emails, as well as sexually explicit instant messages, to teenage boys who had formerly served and were at that time serving as Congressional pages. As a result of the disclosures, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement conducted investigations of the messages to find possible criminal charges. Each ended with no criminal finding. In the case of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, FDLE commissioner Gerald Bailey with the closure of the case stated that the &quot;FDLE conducted as thorough and comprehensive investigation as possible considering Congress and Mr. Foley denied us access to critical data.&quot; The House Ethics Committee also conducted an investigation into the response of the House Republican leadership and their staff to possible earlier warnings of Foley&#x27;s conduct.

==Early career==
Foley was born in Newton, Massachusetts, the son of Frances and Edward Joseph Foley Jr., a teacher and civic activist. Foley served in the Florida House of Representatives 1990–1992 and then in the Florida State Senate 1993–1994.

==Congressional career==

===Early House career===
Foley was elected to the U.S. House in 1994 with 58 percent of the vote, defeating Democrat John Comerford. He was re-elected in 1996 with 64 percent of the vote against Democrat Jim Stuber and again in 1998 (this time without opposition). He was re-elected in 2000 with 60 percent of the vote against Democrat Jean Elliott Brown and Reform Party candidate John McGuire. Constitution Party candidate Jack McLain was his only opponent in 2002. He was re-elected in 2002 with 79 percent of the vote and in 2004 with 68 percent of the vote.

Foley was a moderate Republican. He spent most of his tenure in Congress as a member of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. He was also the first public figure to imply that Vice President Al Gore claimed to have invented the Internet. On March 12, 1999, Reuters reported Foley as saying, &quot;The Vice President is mistaken. The only thing he has ever invented is another tax. He did not invent the Internet but he sure did tax it.&quot;

In late 2000, Foley played a large role in aiding George W. Bush during the Presidential election recount controversy in Florida.

In 2006, Foley was a member of the Republican House leadership, serving as deputy whip.

===Senate campaign===
In 2003, Foley was widely considered the Republican front-runner for Bob Graham&#x27;s Senate seat, especially after Graham had announced his retirement. However, longstanding rumors surfaced that Foley was either homosexual or bisexual and was in a long-term homosexual relationship. The story was initially published only in local and gay press; then the &quot;New Times&quot; broke the story in the mainstream press. Other alternative press rivals, including the &quot;New York Press&quot;, then addressed the topic. Foley held a press conference to denounce the &quot;revolting&quot; rumors and stated that his sexual orientation was unimportant, but did not specifically deny the rumors. A few weeks later, he withdrew his candidacy, saying his father&#x27;s battle with cancer had caused him to reassess his perspective on life (the seat was later won by Republican Mel Martinez). Foley had raised $3 million in campaign contributions before withdrawing.

===Actions in Congress===

====Legislation regarding pornography and sexual offenses====
In the House, Foley was one of the foremost opponents of child pornography. Foley had served as chairman of the House Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children. He introduced a bill, coined the &quot;Child Modeling Exploitation Prevention Act of 2002&quot; to outlaw websites featuring sexually suggestive images of preteen children, saying that &quot;these websites are nothing more than a fix for pedophiles.&quot; As it was written, the bill would have prohibited commercial photography of children and it failed due to the unmanageable burden it would have presented to the legitimate entertainment industry. In June 2003 he wrote letters to the governor and attorney general of Florida, asking them to review the legality of a program for teenagers of a Lake Como nudist resort in Land o&#x27; Lakes, Florida.

Foley&#x27;s legislation to change federal sex offender laws was supported by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; host John Walsh and a number of victims&#x27; rights groups. President Bush signed it into law as part of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006.

Foley also succeeded in getting a law passed that allows volunteer youth-serving organizations like the Boy Scouts of America and Boys and Girls Clubs to have access to FBI fingerprint background checks.

===Other social issues===
Foley&#x27;s stances on many social issues differ from his party&#x27;s leadership. Although he professes to be Roman Catholic Foley was a member of The Republican Majority For Choice which does not believe there should be any restriction on abortion. He has, however, advocated alternatives such as adoption and sexual abstinence. He also supported the Patriot Act, the death penalty and strict sentencing for hate crimes. Foley was a member of Christine Todd Whitman&#x27;s It&#x27;s My Party Too and the Republican Main Street Partnership. According to the &quot;National Journal&quot;&#x27;s calculations, in 2005, Foley&#x27;s voting record on social policy issues was moderate.

====Other domestic issues====
Foley helped secure the first-ever financial commitment from Congress for the preservation of Florida&#x27;s Everglades.

Foley helped pass legislation that expedites the deportation of non-violent criminal aliens serving their sentences in federal prisons; and helped eliminate federal prohibitions on notifying a campus community when a student commits a violent crime.

Foley worked to pass legislation to help surviving heirs of Holocaust victims who have been unable to collect on life insurance policies owed to them.

== Scandal and resignation ==

On September 28, 2006, ABC News Chief Investigative Correspondent Brian Ross reported that in 2005, Foley had sent email messages from his personal AOL account to a former Congressional page, asking the page to send a photo of himself to Foley, among other things. Foley&#x27;s office confirmed that Foley had sent the messages but said it has a practice of asking for photos of individuals who may ask for recommendations and that the page had requested a recommendation.

The original news report prompted another page to come forward and on September 29, 2006, ABC News reported that it had seen excerpts of sexually explicit instant messages allegedly sent by Foley. The instant messages made repeated references to sexual organs and acts.

Kirk Fordham, chief of staff to Tom Reynolds (chairman of the fundraising National Republican Congressional Committee) and former chief of staff to Foley, said that he was with Foley on September 29, 2006, when ABC confronted him with the explicit messages before they were publicized. Fordham then informed Reynolds and Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert; he returned with a one-sentence resignation letter that Foley signed. Hastert and Reynolds made it clear that if Foley didn&#x27;t resign, he would be expelled from the House. That same day, Foley tendered his resignation to Hastert as well as Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Foley said in a statement, &quot;I am deeply sorry and I apologize for letting down my family and the people of Florida I have had the privilege to represent.&quot; Once the news report became more widely known, Foley&#x27;s chances of retaining his seat in Congress were limited. Hastert said in an October 2 press conference that he would have demanded Foley&#x27;s expulsion from the House had he tried to stay in office. (Ironically, Hastert himself was described by a Federal District Court judge as a &quot;serial child molester&quot; and jailed in 2016 for illegally structuring bank withdrawals in an attempt to hide his own sexual abuse of four high school boys during his pre-Congressional career ). Even if Foley had tried to get his seat back, polls showed him losing badly to his Democratic opponent, Tim Mahoney.

More pages came forward, alleging a history of inappropriate conduct by Foley dating back at least 10 years. Foley had been warned about the matter in 2005 by another House Republican and the House Clerk. Through his lawyer, Foley insisted he was not a pedophile and asserted that he had not &quot;had contact&quot; with a minor.

Foley also explained that he had a drinking problem and had made the communications while intoxicated. He checked himself into a rehab clinic on October 2, 2006. His lawyer revealed that Foley claimed he was molested by a clergyman when he was between the ages of 13 and 15 adding that &quot;Mark Foley wants you to know he is a gay man.&quot; Federal authorities said the explicit messages could result in Foley&#x27;s prosecution, under some of the same laws he helped to enact.

Foley resigned from the US Congress on Friday, September 29, 2006.

There was widespread criticism of Republican leaders for their response to earlier warnings and inconsistencies in their statements. In particular, many called for Hastert to resign, including some conservative voices such as the editorial page of &quot;The Washington Times&quot;.

On October 19, 2006, the &quot;Sarasota Herald-Tribune&quot; stated that a disgraced abusive homosexual Catholic priest named Anthony Mercieca told the newspaper about an intimate two-year relationship he had with Foley when the congressman was a teenage altar boy living in Lake Worth, Florida. The priest is retired and living in Malta. He acknowledged getting naked in saunas and possible &quot;light touching&quot;, but denied contact of a sexual nature.

Florida officials closed the investigation of Foley, stating they found &quot;insufficient evidence&quot; to file criminal charges since the page was over the age of consent (16).

==November 2006 election==
Shortly after Foley resigned, the Republican Party of Florida named State Representative Joe Negron to run as the Republican replacement candidate to face Mahoney. In accordance with Florida election law, Foley&#x27;s name remained on the ballot. Votes cast for Foley in the November election counted towards Negron&#x27;s total. Mahoney called for a full investigation of Foley&#x27;s actions. Foley&#x27;s district had been held by Republicans since its creation in 1973 (it was the 10th District until 1983 and the 12th District until 1993.) In an effort to use the scandal to his benefit, Negron used the slogan &quot;Punch Foley for Joe!&quot;, instructing voters to &quot;punch&quot; Foley&#x27;s name on the ballot to chastise him and support Negron.

Negron narrowly lost the election to Tim Mahoney. Negron had 47.7 percent and Mahoney had 49.5 percent. The seat fell back into Republican hands in the 111th Congress with the 2008 election of Tom Rooney.

==Post-congressional life==
After leaving Congress, Foley entered the real estate business in Palm Beach, Florida. He also came out publicly and was in a relationship with Palm Beach dermatologist Layne Nisenbaum until Nisenbaum&#x27;s death in 2012. On September 22, 2009, Foley debuted as host of his own radio show, &quot;Foley on Politics&quot;, on Seaview AM 960 in North Palm Beach, Florida.

After several years removed from the public eye, Foley resurfaced as a supporter of Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election, appearing behind him in a crowd at one of his rallies.

==Electoral history==

1According to Florida law, the names of those with no opposition are not printed on the ballot and no totals need be submitted.&lt;br&gt;
2Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 2000, write-ins received 9 votes.&lt;br&gt;
3Mark Foley&#x27;s name was the one on the ballot, however, as noted above.

<doc id="411226" wikidata="Q5086940" url="?curid=411226" title="Charts on SO(3)">
<text>In mathematics, the special orthogonal group in three dimensions, otherwise known as the rotation group SO(3), is a naturally occurring example of a manifold. The various [[Chart (topology)|chart]]s on SO(3) set up rival coordinate systems: in this case there cannot be said to be a preferred set of parameters describing a rotation. There are three degrees of freedom, so that the dimension of SO(3) is three. In numerous applications one or other coordinate system is used, and the question arises how to convert from a given system to another.

==The space of rotations==
In geometry the rotation group is the group of all rotations about the origin of three-dimensional Euclidean space R3 under the operation of composition. By definition, a rotation about the origin is a linear transformation that preserves length of vectors (it is an isometry) and preserves orientation (i.e. &quot;handedness&quot;) of space. A length-preserving transformation which reverses orientation is called an improper rotation. Every improper rotation of three-dimensional Euclidean space is a rotation followed by a reflection in a plane through the origin.

Composing two rotations results in another rotation; every rotation has a unique inverse rotation; and the identity map satisfies the definition of a rotation. Owing to the above properties, the set of all rotations is a group under composition. Moreover, the rotation group has a natural manifold structure for which the group operations are smooth; so it is in fact a Lie group. The rotation group is often denoted SO(3) for reasons explained below.

The space of rotations is isomorphic with the set of rotation operators and the set of orthonormal matrices with determinant +1. It is also closely related (double covered) with the set of quaternions with their internal product, as well as to the set of rotation vectors (though here the relation is harder to describe, see below for details), with a different internal composition operation given by the product of their equivalent matrices.

Rotation vectors notation arise from the Euler&#x27;s rotation theorem which states that any rotation in three dimensions can be described by a rotation by some angle about some axis. Considering this, we can then specify the axis of one of these rotations by two angles, and we can use the radius of the vector to specify the angle of rotation. These vectors represent a ball in 3D with an unusual topology.

This 3D solid sphere is equivalent to the surface of a 4D disc, which is also a 3D variety. For doing this equivalence, we will have to define how will we represent a rotation with this 4D-embedded surface.

==The hypersphere of rotations==
===Visualizing the hypersphere===
It is interesting to consider the space as the three-dimensional sphere S3, the boundary of a disk in 4-dimensional Euclidean space. For doing this, we will have to define how we represent a rotation with this 4D-embedded surface.

The way in which the radius can be used to specify the angle of rotation is not straightforward. It can be related to circles of latitude in a sphere with a defined north pole and is explained as follows:

Beginning at the north pole of a sphere in three-dimensional space, we specify the point at the north pole to represent the identity rotation. In the case of the identity rotation, no axis of rotation is defined, and the angle of rotation (zero) is irrelevant. A rotation with its axis contained in the &quot;xy&quot;-plane and a very small rotation angle can be specified by a slice through the sphere parallel to the &quot;xy&quot;-plane and very near the north pole. The circle defined by this slice will be very small, corresponding to the small angle of the rotation. As the rotation angles become larger, the slice moves southward, and the circles become larger until the equator of the sphere is reached, which will correspond to a rotation angle of 180 degrees. Continuing southward, the radii of the circles now become smaller (corresponding to the absolute value of the angle of the rotation considered as a negative number). Finally, as the south pole is reached, the circles shrink once more to the identity rotation, which is also specified as the point at the south pole. Notice that a number of characteristics of such rotations and their representations can be seen by this visualization.

The space of rotations is continuous, each rotation has a neighborhood of rotations which are nearly the same, and this neighborhood becomes flat as the neighborhood shrinks.

===Aliases===
Also, each rotation is actually represented by two antipodal points on the sphere, which are at opposite ends of a line through the center of the sphere. This reflects the fact that each rotation can be represented as a rotation about some axis, or, equivalently, as a negative rotation about an axis pointing in the opposite direction (a so-called double cover). The &quot;latitude&quot; of a circle representing a particular rotation angle will be half of the angle represented by that rotation, since as the point is moved from the north to south pole, the latitude ranges from zero to 180 degrees, while the angle of rotation ranges from 0 to 360 degrees. (the &quot;longitude&quot; of a point then represents a particular axis of rotation.) Note however that this set of rotations is not closed under composition.

Two successive rotations with axes in the &quot;xy&quot;-plane will not necessarily give a rotation whose axis lies in the &quot;xy&quot;-plane, and thus cannot be represented as a point on the sphere. This will not be the case with a general rotation in 3-space, which do form a closed set under composition.

This visualization can be extended to a general rotation in 3-dimensional space. The identity rotation is a point, and a small angle of rotation about some axis can be represented as a point on a sphere with a small radius. As the angle of rotation grows, the sphere grows, until the angle of rotation reaches 180 degrees, at which point the sphere begins to shrink, becoming a point as the angle approaches 360 degrees (or zero degrees from the negative direction). This set of expanding and contracting spheres represents a hypersphere in four-dimensional space (a 3-sphere).

Just as in the simpler example above, each rotation represented as a point on the hypersphere is matched by its antipodal point on that hypersphere. The &quot;latitude&quot; on the hypersphere will be half of the corresponding angle of rotation, and the neighborhood of any point will become &quot;flatter&quot; (i.e. be represented by a 3D Euclidean space of points) as the neighborhood shrinks.

This behavior is matched by the set of unit quaternions: A general quaternion represents a point in a four-dimensional space, but constraining it to have unit magnitude yields a three-dimensional space equivalent to the surface of a hypersphere. The magnitude of the unit quaternion will be unity, corresponding to a hypersphere of unit radius.

The vector part of a unit quaternion represents the radius of the 2-sphere corresponding to the axis of rotation, and its magnitude is the sine of half the angle of rotation. Each rotation is represented by two unit quaternions of opposite sign, and, as in the space of rotations in three dimensions, the quaternion product of two unit quaternions will yield a unit quaternion. Also, the space of unit quaternions is &quot;flat&quot; in any infinitesimal neighborhood of a given unit quaternion.

==Parametrizations==
We can parameterize the space of rotations in several ways, but degenerations will always appear. For example, if we use three angles (Euler angles), such parameterization is degenerate at some points on the hypersphere, leading to the problem of gimbal lock. We can avoid this by using four Euclidean coordinates &quot;w&quot;,&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;, with &quot;w&quot;2 + &quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;y&quot;2 + &quot;z&quot;2 = 1. The point (&quot;w&quot;,&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;) represents a rotation around the axis directed by the vector (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;) by an angle 
:formula_1

This problem is similar to parameterize the bidimensional surface of a sphere with two coordinates, such as latitude and longitude. Latitude and longitude are ill-behaved (degenerate) at the north and south poles, though the poles are not intrinsically different from any other points on the sphere. At the poles (latitudes +90° and −90°), the longitude becomes meaningless. It can be shown that no two-parameter coordinate system can avoid such degeneracy.

The possible parametrizations candidates include:

*Euler angles (θ,φ,ψ), representing a product of rotations about the &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; axes;
*Tait–Bryan angles (θ,φ,ψ), representing a product of rotations about the &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; axes;
*Axis angle pair (n, θ) of a unit vector representing an axis, and an angle of rotation about it;
*A quaternion q of length 1 (cf. Versor, quaternions and spatial rotation, 3-sphere), the components of which are also called Euler–Rodrigues parameters;
*a 3 × 3 skew-symmetric matrix, via exponentiation; the 3 × 3 skew-symmetric matrices are the Lie algebra formula_2, and this is the exponential map in Lie theory;
*Cayley rational parameters, based on the Cayley transform, usable in all characteristics;
*Möbius transformations, formula_3 acting on the Riemann sphere.

===Problems of the parametrizations===
There are problems in using these as more than local charts, to do with their multiple-valued nature, and singularities. That is, one must be careful above all to work only with diffeomorphisms in the definition of chart. Problems of this sort are inevitable, since SO(3) is diffeomorphic to real projective space P3(R), which is a quotient of S3 by identifying antipodal points, and charts try to model a manifold using R3.

This explains why, for example, the Euler angles appear to give a variable in the 3-torus, and the unit quaternions in a 3-sphere. The uniqueness of the representation by Euler angles breaks down at some points (cf. gimbal lock), while the quaternion representation is always a double cover, with &quot;q&quot; and −&quot;q&quot; giving the same rotation.

If we use a skew-symmetric matrix, every 3 × 3 skew-symmetric matrix is determined by 3 parameters, and so at first glance, the parameter space is R3. Exponentiating such a matrix results in an orthogonal 3 × 3 matrix of determinant 1 – in other words, a rotation matrix, but this is a many-to-one map. Note that it is not a covering map – while it is a local homeomorphism near the origin, it is not a covering map at rotations by 180 degrees. It is possible to restrict these matrices to a ball around the origin in R3 so that rotations do not exceed 180 degrees, and this will be one-to-one, except for rotations by 180 degrees, which correspond to the boundary S2, and these identify antipodal points – this is the cut locus. The 3-ball with this identification of the boundary is P3(R). A similar situation holds for applying a Cayley transform to the skew-symmetric matrix.

Axis angle gives parameters in S2 × S1; if we replace the unit vector by the actual axis of rotation, so that n and −n give the same axis line, the set of axis becomes P2(R), the real projective plane. But since rotations around n and −n are parameterized by opposite values of θ, the result is an S1 bundle over P2(R), which turns out to be P3(R).

Fractional linear transformations use four complex parameters, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;d&quot;, with the condition that &quot;ad&quot;−&quot;bc&quot; is non-zero. Since multiplying all four parameters by the same complex number does not change the parameter, we can insist that &quot;ad&quot;−&quot;bc&quot;=1. This suggests writing (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;) as a 2 × 2 complex matrix of determinant 1, that is, as an element of the special linear group SL(2,C). But not all such matrices produce rotations: conformal maps on S2 are also included. To only get rotations we insist that &quot;d&quot; is the complex conjugate of &quot;a&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; is the negative of the complex conjugate of &quot;b&quot;. Then we have two complex numbers, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, subject to |&quot;a&quot;|2+|&quot;b&quot;|2=1. If we write &quot;a&quot;+&quot;bj&quot;, this is a quaternion of unit length.

Ultimately, since R3 is not P3(R), there will be a problem with each of these approaches. In some cases, we need to remember that certain parameter values result in the same rotation, and to remove this issue, boundaries must be set up, but then a path through this region in R3 must then suddenly jump to a different region when it crosses a boundary. Gimbal lock is a problem when the derivative of the map is not full rank, which occurs with Euler angles and Tait–Bryan angles, but not for the other choices. The quaternion representation has none of these problems (being a two-to-one mapping everywhere), but it has 4 parameters with a condition (unit length), which sometimes makes it harder to see the three degrees of freedom available.

===Applications===
One area in which these considerations, in some form, become inevitable, is the kinematics of a rigid body. One can take as definition the idea of a curve in the Euclidean group &quot;E&quot;(3) of three-dimensional Euclidean space, starting at the identity (initial position). The translation subgroup &quot;T&quot; of &quot;E&quot;(3) is a normal subgroup, with quotient SO(3) if we look at the subgroup &quot;E&quot;+(3) of direct isometries only (which is reasonable in kinematics). The translational part can be decoupled from the rotational part in standard Newtonian kinematics by considering the motion of the center of mass, and rotations of the rigid body about the center of mass. Therefore, any rigid body movement leads directly to SO(3), when we factor out the translational part.

These identifications illustrate that SO(3) is connected but not simply connected. As to the latter, in the ball with antipodal surface points identified, consider the path running from the &quot;north pole&quot; straight through the center down to the south pole. This is a closed loop, since the north pole and the south pole are identified. This loop cannot be shrunk to a point, since no matter how you deform the loop, the start and end point have to remain antipodal, or else the loop will &quot;break open&quot;. In terms of rotations, this loop represents a continuous sequence of rotations about the &quot;z&quot;-axis starting and ending at the identity rotation (i.e. a series of rotations through an angle φ where φ runs from 0 to 2π).

Surprisingly, if you run through the path twice, i.e., from north pole down to south pole and back to the north pole so that φ runs from 0 to 4π, you get a closed loop which &quot;can&quot; be shrunk to a single point: first move the paths continuously to the ball&#x27;s surface, still connecting north pole to south pole twice. The second half of the path can then be mirrored over to the antipodal side without changing the path at all. Now we have an ordinary closed loop on the surface of the ball, connecting the north pole to itself along a great circle. This circle can be shrunk to the north pole without problems. The Balinese plate trick and similar tricks demonstrate this practically.

The same argument can be performed in general, and it shows that the fundamental group of SO(3) is cyclic group of order 2. In physics applications, the non-triviality of the fundamental group allows for the existence of objects known as spinors, and is an important tool in the development of the spin–statistics theorem.

The universal cover of SO(3) is a Lie group called Spin(3). The group Spin(3) is isomorphic to the special unitary group SU(2); it is also diffeomorphic to the unit 3-sphere S3 and can be understood as the group of unit quaternions (i.e. those with absolute value 1). The connection between quaternions and rotations, commonly exploited in computer graphics, is explained in quaternions and spatial rotations. The map from S3 onto SO(3) that identifies antipodal points of S3 is a surjective homomorphism of Lie groups, with kernel {±1}. Topologically, this map is a two-to-one covering map.

<text>In mathematics the spin group, denoted Spin(&quot;n&quot;), is a Lie group whose underlying manifold is the double cover of the special orthogonal group , such that there exists a short exact sequence of Lie groups (when )

:formula_1

The group multiplication law on the double cover is given by lifting the multiplication on formula_2.

As a Lie group, Spin(&quot;n&quot;) therefore shares its dimension, , and its Lie algebra with the special orthogonal group.

For , Spin(&quot;n&quot;) is simply connected and so coincides with the universal cover of SO(&quot;n&quot;).

The non-trivial element of the kernel is denoted −1, which should not be confused with the orthogonal transform of reflection through the origin, generally denoted −.

Spin(&quot;n&quot;) can be constructed as a subgroup of the invertible elements in the Clifford algebra Cl(&quot;n&quot;). A distinct article discusses the spin representations.

==Motivation and physical interpretation==
The spin group is used in physics to describe the symmetries of (electrically neutral, uncharged) fermions. Its complexification, Spinc, is used to describe electrically charged fermions, most notably the electron. Strictly speaking, the spin group describes a fermion in a zero-dimensional space; however, space is not zero-dimensional, and so the spin group is used to define spin structures on (pseudo-)Riemannian manifolds: the spin group is the structure group of a spinor bundle. The affine connection on a spinor bundle is the spin connection; the spin connection can simplify calculations in general relativity. The spin connection in turn enables the Dirac equation to be written in curved spacetime (effectively in the tetrad coordinates), which in turn provides a footing for quantum gravity, as well as a formalization of Hawking radiation (where one of a pair of entangled, virtual fermions falls past the event horizon, and the other does not).

==Construction==
Construction of the Spin group often starts with the construction of a Clifford algebra over a real vector space &quot;V&quot; with a definite quadratic form &quot;q&quot;. The Clifford algebra is the quotient of the tensor algebra T&quot;V&quot; of &quot;V&quot; by a two-sided ideal. The tensor algebra (over the reals) may be written as 
:formula_3

The Clifford algebra Cl(&quot;V&quot;) is then the quotient algebra
:formula_4
where formula_5 is the quadratic form applied to a vector formula_6. The resulting space is finite dimensional, naturally graded (as a vector space), and can be written as 
:formula_7
where formula_8 is the dimension of formula_9, formula_10 and formula_11. The spin algebra formula_12 is defined as
:formula_13
where the last is a short-hand for &quot;V&quot; being a real vector space of real dimension &quot;n&quot;. It is a Lie algebra; it has a natural action on &quot;V&quot;, and in this way can be shown to be isomorphic to the Lie algebra formula_14 of the special orthogonal group.

The pin group formula_15 is a subgroup of formula_16&#x27;s Clifford group of all elements of the form 
:formula_17 
where each formula_18 is of unit length: formula_19

The spin group is then defined as 
:formula_20
where 
formula_21
is the subspace generated by elements that are the product of an even number of vectors. That is, Spin(&quot;V&quot;) consists of all elements of Pin(&quot;V&quot;), given above, with the restriction to &quot;k&quot; being an even number. The restriction to the even subspace is key to the formation of two-component (Weyl) spinors, constructed below.

If the set formula_22 are an orthonormal basis of the (real) vector space &quot;V&quot;, then the quotient above endows the space with a natural anti-commuting structure:
:formula_23 for formula_24
which follows by considering formula_25 for formula_26. This anti-commutation turns out to be of importance in physics, as it captures the spirit of the Pauli exclusion principle for fermions. A precise formulation is out of scope here, but it involves the creation of a spinor bundle on Minkowski spacetime; the resulting spinor fields can be seen to be anti-commuting as a by-product of the Clifford algebra construction. This anti-commutation property is also key to the formulation of supersymmetry. The Clifford algebra and the spin group have many interesting and curious properties, some of which are listed below.

=== Geometric construction ===
The spin groups can be constructed less explicitly but without appealing to Clifford algebras. As a manifold, formula_27 is the double cover of formula_2. Its multiplication law can be defined by lifting as follows. Call the covering map formula_29. Then formula_30 is a set with two elements, and one can be chosen without loss of generality to be the identity. Call this formula_31. Then to define multiplication in formula_27, for formula_33 choose paths formula_34 satisfying formula_35, and formula_36. These define a path formula_37 in formula_2 defined formula_39 satisfying formula_40. Since formula_27 is a double cover, there is a unique lift formula_42 of formula_37 with formula_44. Then define the product as formula_45.

It can then be shown that this definition is independent of the paths formula_34, that the multiplication is continuous, and the group axioms are satisfied with inversion being continuous, making formula_27 a Lie group.

== Double covering==
For a quadratic space &quot;V&quot;, a double covering of SO(&quot;V&quot;) by Spin(&quot;V&quot;) can be given explicitly, as follows. Let formula_22 be an orthonormal basis for &quot;V&quot;. Define an antiautomorphism formula_49 by
:formula_50
This can be extended to all elements of formula_51 by linearity. It is an antihomomorphism since
:formula_52

Observe that formula_15 can then be defined as all elements formula_54 for which
:formula_55

Now define the automorphism formula_56 which on degree 1 elements is given by
:formula_57
and let formula_58 denote formula_59, which is an antiautomorphism of formula_16. With this notation, an explicit double covering is the homomorphism formula_61 given by
:formula_62
where formula_63. When formula_64 has degree 1 (i.e. formula_65), formula_66 is the reflection across the hyperplane orthogonal to formula_64; this follows from the anti-commuting property of the Clifford algebra.

This gives a double covering of both formula_68 by formula_15 and of formula_70 by formula_71 because formula_64 gives the same transformation as formula_73.

== Spinor space==
It is worth reviewing how spinor space and Weyl spinors are constructed, given this formalism. Given a real vector space &quot;V&quot; of dimension an even number, its complexification is formula_74. It can be written as the direct sum of a subspace formula_75 of spinors and a subspace formula_76 of anti-spinors:

:formula_77

The space formula_75 is spanned by the spinors
formula_79
for formula_80 and the complex conjugate spinors span formula_76. It is straightforward to see that the spinors anti-commute, and that the product of a spinor and anti-spinor is a scalar.

The spinor space is defined as the exterior algebra formula_82. The (complexified) Clifford algebra acts naturally on this space; the (complexified) spin group corresponds to the length-preserving endomorphisms. There is a natural grading on the exterior algebra: the product of an odd number of copies of formula_75 correspond to the physics notion of fermions; the even subspace corresponds to the bosons. The representations of the action of the spin group on the spinor space can be built in a relatively straightforward fashion.

==Complex case==

The SpinC group is defined by the exact sequence 
:formula_84

It is a multiplicative subgroup of the complexification formula_85 of the Clifford algebra, and specifically, it is the subgroup generated by Spin(&quot;V&quot;) and the unit circle in C. Alternately, it is the quotient
:formula_86
where the equivalence formula_87 identifies with .

This has important applications in 4-manifold theory and Seiberg–Witten theory. In physics, the Spin group is appropriate for describing uncharged fermions, while the SpinC group is used to describe electrically charged fermions. In this case, the U(1) symmetry is specifically the gauge group (structure group) of electromagnetism.

==Exceptional isomorphisms==
In low dimensions, there are isomorphisms among the classical Lie groups called &quot;exceptional isomorphisms&quot;. For instance, there are isomorphisms between low-dimensional spin groups and certain classical Lie groups, owing to low-dimensional isomorphisms between the root systems (and corresponding isomorphisms of Dynkin diagrams) of the different families of simple Lie algebras. Writing R for the reals, C for the complex numbers, H for the quaternions and the general understanding that Cl(&quot;n&quot;) is a short-hand for Cl(R&quot;n&quot;) and that Spin(&quot;n&quot;) is a short-hand for Spin(R&quot;n&quot;) and so on, one then has that

:Cleven(1) = R the real numbers
:Pin(1) = {+i, −i, +1, −1}
:Spin(1) = O(1) = {+1, −1}     the orthogonal group of dimension zero.
:Cleven(2) = C the complex numbers
:Spin(2) = U(1) = SO(2), which acts on &quot;z&quot; in R2 by double phase rotation . Corresponds to the abelian formula_88.     dim = 1
:Cleven(3) = H the quaternions
:Spin(3) = Sp(1) = SU(2), corresponding to formula_89.     dim = 3
:Cleven(4) = H ⊕ H
:Spin(4) = SU(2) × SU(2), corresponding to formula_90.     dim = 6
:Cleven(5)= M(2, H) the two-by-two matrices with quaternionic coefficients
:Spin(5) = Sp(2), corresponding to formula_91.     dim = 10
:Cleven(6)= M(4, C) the four-by-four matrices with complex coefficients
:Spin(6) = SU(4), corresponding to formula_92.     dim = 15

There are certain vestiges of these isomorphisms left over for (see Spin(8) for more details). For higher &quot;n&quot;, these isomorphisms disappear entirely.

==Indefinite signature==
In indefinite signature, the spin group is constructed through Clifford algebras in a similar way to standard spin groups. It is a double cover of , the connected component of the identity of the indefinite orthogonal group . For , is connected; for there are two connected components. As in definite signature, there are some accidental isomorphisms in low dimensions:

:Spin(1, 1) = GL(1, R)
:Spin(2, 1) = SL(2, R)
:Spin(3, 1) = SL(2, C)
:Spin(2, 2) = SL(2, R) × SL(2, R)
:Spin(4, 1) = Sp(1, 1)
:Spin(3, 2) = Sp(4, R)
:Spin(5, 1) = SL(2, H)
:Spin(4, 2) = SU(2, 2)
:Spin(3, 3) = SL(4, R)
:Spin(6, 2) = SU(2, 2, H)

Note that .

==Topological considerations==
Connected and simply connected Lie groups are classified by their Lie algebra. So if &quot;G&quot; is a connected Lie group with a simple Lie algebra, with &quot;G&quot;′ the universal cover of &quot;G&quot;, there is an inclusion

:formula_93

with Z(&quot;G&quot;′) the center of &quot;G&quot;′. This inclusion and the Lie algebra formula_94 of &quot;G&quot; determine &quot;G&quot; entirely (note that it is not the case that formula_94 and π1(&quot;G&quot;) determine &quot;G&quot; entirely; for instance SL(2, R) and PSL(2, R) have the same Lie algebra and same fundamental group Z, but are not isomorphic).

The definite signature Spin(&quot;n&quot;) are all simply connected for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2, so they are the universal coverings of SO(&quot;n&quot;).

In indefinite signature, Spin(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) is not necessarily connected, and in general the identity component, Spin0(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;), is not simply connected, thus it is not a universal cover. The fundamental group is most easily understood by considering the maximal compact subgroup of SO(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;), which is SO(&quot;p&quot;) × SO(&quot;q&quot;), and noting that rather than being the product of the 2-fold covers (hence a 4-fold cover), Spin(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) is the &quot;diagonal&quot; 2-fold cover – it is a 2-fold quotient of the 4-fold cover. Explicitly, the maximal compact connected subgroup of Spin(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) is

:Spin(&quot;p&quot;) × Spin(&quot;q&quot;)/{(1, 1), (−1, −1)}.

This allows us to calculate the fundamental groups of SO(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;), taking &quot;p&quot; ≥ &quot;q&quot;:

:formula_96

Thus once the fundamental group is Z2, as it is a 2-fold quotient of a product of two universal covers.

The maps on fundamental groups are given as follows. For , this implies that the map is given by going to . For , this map is given by . And finally, for , is sent to and is sent to .

=== Fundamental groups of SO(n) ===
The fundamental groups formula_97 can be more directly derived using results in homotopy theory. In particular we can find formula_97 for formula_99 as the three smallest have familiar underlying manifolds: formula_100 is the point manifold, formula_101, and formula_102 (shown using the axis-angle representation).

The proof uses known results in algebraic topology.
The same argument can be used to show formula_103, by considering a fibration
formula_104
where formula_105 is the upper sheet of a two-sheeted hyperboloid, which is contractible, and formula_106 is the identity component of the proper Lorentz group (the proper orthochronous Lorentz group).

==Center==
The center of the spin groups, for , (complex and real) are given as follows:
:formula_107

==Quotient groups==
Quotient groups can be obtained from a spin group by quotienting out by a subgroup of the center, with the spin group then being a covering group of the resulting quotient, and both groups having the same Lie algebra.

Quotienting out by the entire center yields the minimal such group, the projective special orthogonal group, which is centerless, while quotienting out by {±1} yields the special orthogonal group – if the center equals {±1} (namely in odd dimension), these two quotient groups agree. If the spin group is simply connected (as Spin(&quot;n&quot;) is for ), then Spin is the &quot;maximal&quot; group in the sequence, and one has a sequence of three groups,
:Spin(&quot;n&quot;) → SO(&quot;n&quot;) → PSO(&quot;n&quot;),
splitting by parity yields:
:Spin(2&quot;n&quot;) → SO(2&quot;n&quot;) → PSO(2&quot;n&quot;),
:Spin(2&quot;n&quot;+1) → SO(2&quot;n&quot;+1) = PSO(2&quot;n&quot;+1),
which are the three compact real forms (or two, if ) of the compact Lie algebra formula_108

The homotopy groups of the cover and the quotient are related by the long exact sequence of a fibration, with discrete fiber (the fiber being the kernel) – thus all homotopy groups for are equal, but π0 and π1 may differ.

For , Spin(&quot;n&quot;) is simply connected ( is trivial), so SO(&quot;n&quot;) is connected and has fundamental group Z2 while PSO(&quot;n&quot;) is connected and has fundamental group equal to the center of Spin(&quot;n&quot;).

In indefinite signature the covers and homotopy groups are more complicated – Spin(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) is not simply connected, and quotienting also affects connected components. The analysis is simpler if one considers the maximal (connected) compact and the component group of .

==Whitehead tower==
The spin group appears in a Whitehead tower anchored by the orthogonal group:

:formula_109

The tower is obtained by successively removing (killing) homotopy groups of increasing order. This is done by constructing short exact sequences starting with an Eilenberg–MacLane space for the homotopy group to be removed. Killing the 3 homotopy group in Spin(&quot;n&quot;), one obtains the infinite-dimensional string group String(&quot;n&quot;).

==Discrete subgroups==
Discrete subgroups of the spin group can be understood by relating them to discrete subgroups of the special orthogonal group (rotational point groups).

Given the double cover , by the lattice theorem, there is a Galois connection between subgroups of Spin(&quot;n&quot;) and subgroups of SO(&quot;n&quot;) (rotational point groups): the image of a subgroup of Spin(&quot;n&quot;) is a rotational point group, and the preimage of a point group is a subgroup of Spin(&quot;n&quot;), and the closure operator on subgroups of Spin(&quot;n&quot;) is multiplication by {±1}. These may be called &quot;binary point groups&quot;; most familiar is the 3-dimensional case, known as binary polyhedral groups.

Concretely, every binary point group is either the preimage of a point group (hence denoted 2&quot;G&quot;, for the point group &quot;G&quot;), or is an index 2 subgroup of the preimage of a point group which maps (isomorphically) onto the point group; in the latter case the full binary group is abstractly formula_110 (since {±1} is central). As an example of these latter, given a cyclic group of odd order formula_111 in SO(&quot;n&quot;), its preimage is a cyclic group of twice the order, formula_112 and the subgroup maps isomorphically to .

Of particular note are two series:
* higher binary tetrahedral groups, corresponding to the 2-fold cover of symmetries of the &quot;n&quot;-simplex; this group can also be considered as the double cover of the symmetric group, , with the alternating group being the (rotational) symmetry group of the &quot;n&quot;-simplex.
* higher binary octahedral groups, corresponding to the 2-fold covers of the hyperoctahedral group (symmetries of the hypercube, or equivalently of its dual, the cross-polytope).

For point groups that reverse orientation, the situation is more complicated, as there are two pin groups, so there are two possible binary groups corresponding to a given point group.

<doc id="411233" wikidata="Q533073" url="?curid=411233" title="Kendrick Meek">
<text>Kendrick Brett Meek (born September 6, 1966) is an American politician and current fossil fuel industry spokesperson, who served as the U.S. representative for from 2003 to 2011. After serving in both houses of the Florida Legislature, Meek was elected to Congress in the 2002 election to succeed his mother Carrie Meek.

Meek was the Democratic nominee in the 2010 Senate election, coming in third behind Republican Marco Rubio and independent candidate Charlie Crist.

==Early life, education and career==
Kendrick, the son of retired Congresswoman Carrie Meek (née Pittman) and Harold H. Meek, was born on September 6, 1966, in Miami, Florida. He is the great grandson of The Reverend Horatius &quot;H.H.&quot; Coleman, who was pastor of Greater Macedonia Baptist Church in Detroit, Michigan.

He graduated from Miami Springs High School in Miami, where he played football as a defensive lineman. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Criminal Justice in 1989 from Florida A&amp;M University. Meek was a star football player in college and also founded the Young Democrats at Florida A&amp;M, later serving as President of the organization. He was also initiated into the Omega Psi Phi fraternity through the Upsilon Psi chapter.

After graduating from college Meek was sworn in as a trooper with the Florida Highway Patrol and was assigned to Miami. During his four-year tenure, Meek, through his political connections, became the first African American to reach the rank of captain. He later served on the security detail for Democratic Lieutenant Governor, Buddy MacKay and subsequently launched his political career.

==Florida State House of Representatives==
Meek served in the Florida House of Representatives from 1995 to 1998. While in the Florida House, Meek worked on various economic and social justice issues. This work culminated in building out a bipartisan coalition to provide compensation for Freddie Lee Pitts and Wilbert Lee, two African Americans who were falsely convicted of murder 35 years earlier. Nineteen different attempts to pass legislation in the state legislature were defeated by a traditional Southern Democratic faction of conservative legislators from the Florida Panhandle. In 1998, Meek reintroduced the bill in the Florida House and successfully allied with Republicans to pass it.

==Florida State Senate==
From 1998 to 2002, Kendrick Meek was a member of the Florida Senate.

===One Florida sit-in===

Meek, along with fellow member Rep. Tony Hill, staged a sit-in protest in Governor Jeb Bush&#x27;s office in January, 2000. The sit-in lasted for 25 hours, with the central issue being a newly implemented &quot;One Florida&quot; plan to end official race/gender preferences in state government. Meek said he and Hill staged the sit-in after they tried but were unable to get &quot;a meeting with the governor— two members of the Florida legislature. Then the governor came in and was barking at us as though we were children, saying that if we expect for him to rescind his executive order, then we might as well order some blankets and get comfortable, which we did.&quot; According to Tom Bearden, when Hill and Meek tried to meet with the Governor, &quot;tempers flared&quot;. The two lawmakers and Bush ended the sit-in after Bush agreed to delay implementation of the plan.

In February 2000, Meek said lawsuits might be filed to challenge university regents&#x27; authority to use the One Florida Initiative. &quot;I thank God for using you to bring us to this point.&quot; Meek and Hill issued a press release on June 23, 2003, applauding the Supreme Court for upholding the legality of affirmative action and criticizing Bush for his One Florida Initiative, calling for an end to the initiative in light of the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling, because the initiative has &quot;only served to divide Florida along racial lines.&quot; Governor Bush pointed to the .3% increase in minority enrollment in Florida public-universities between 2002 and 2003 as evidence that the One Florida Initiative was working. Meek responded by accusing Bush of throwing out numbers to &#x27;fake out&#x27; Floridians, telling Bush he had &quot;better check those numbers two or three times. It&#x27;s been a struggle for students of African-American descent. That&#x27;s where the historical discrimination has been.&quot; Florida Atlantic University is the only school that had an increase in African-American freshmen, from 17.2% freshman in 2002 to 18.9% in 2003.

===Class size amendment===
In 2002, Meek launched an initiative to reduce class sizes in Florida&#x27;s public schools. The amendment would set the maximum class sizes of pre-kindergarten through 3rd grade classes to 18, 4th through 8th grade classes to 22, and high school classes to 25. It would also require schools to reduce class sizes by two students in 2003 and to reach full compliance by the beginning of the 2010 school year.

Supporters of the amendment, including People for the American Way, Florida Education Association, and Florida NAACP, focused on large classes in many urban areas of Florida which had as many as 40 students: Meek said, &quot;[for] the first time parents will have a chance to vote on something they&#x27;ve always wanted and that is smaller class sizes.&quot; Then-Florida governor Jeb Bush and state legislature Republicans opposed the bill because it was unclear how much the amendment would cost: &quot;While this may be a worthy goal, we still have to ask the question, where will the money come from?&quot; said Liz Hirst, press secretary to Governor Bush.

Meek spearheaded a petition drive that collected more than 500,000 signatures, allowing the issue to be listed — as Amendment 9 — on the 2002 ballot. He also guided the amendment through two opposition efforts in the Florida Supreme Court as well as the public campaign to oppose the amendment.

On November 5, 2002, Florida voters approved the amendment 52.4% to 47.6%.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Ways and Means
**Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support
**Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures
*NATO Parliamentary Assembly

===Party leadership and caucus membership===
*Democratic Steering and Policy Committee
*Congressional Black Caucus
*Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation

Meek was a member of the New Democrat Coalition. He was also a member of the 30 Something Working Group, a small group of Democrat members who regularly held special order speeches on a variety of topics. Other prominent members included Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Chris Murphy and Tim Ryan.

==Political positions==

===Economic issues===
Meek supports an increase in the minimum wage. He voted for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.

===Social issues===
During his time in Congress, Meek consistently opposed the Hyde Amendment, which restricts federal funding of elective abortion. He also opposes some bans on late-term abortions and notification laws for minors who seek an abortion.

Meek voted against H.J. Res. 88, a proposed amendment to the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage, which failed to pass by a vote of 236 to 187. In a statement in the Congressional Record, Meek said:&quot;This proposed amendment is not directed at any real problem, other than the apparent need of the Republican leadership to gin up political support for their candidates. It is sad that the Republican leadership is not as interested as they say they are in &#x27;protecting&#x27; the institution of marriage as they are in waging a campaign to divide and distract the American people from the real issues that need to be addressed. The nation is at war in Iraq; we face crises in Iran, North Korea and Lebanon; the federal deficit is soaring out of control as more and more U.S. debt is controlled by countries like China; energy costs continue to rise and Americans wait for Congress to act to increase the minimum wage. The Republican response: wasting hours of debate on an unnecessary Constitutional amendment that had already been defeated in the Senate.&quot; During the 2010 Senate campaign, Meek expressed support for gay adoption which had previously been banned in Florida, and referred to Governor Charlie Crist as &quot;the George Wallace of gay adoptions&quot;.

==Political campaigns==
Meek was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives on November 5, 2002, succeeding his mother, Congresswoman Carrie Meek, who retired from the seat.

In Meek&#x27;s four elections to the U.S. House of Representatives, no Republican or third-party candidate had been listed on the general election ballot running against him. He had write-in opponents in three of the four elections and also had a Democratic primary opponent in 2006.

===2010 U.S. Senate campaign===
On January 13, 2009, Meek announced he would run for the seat in the United States Senate that would be vacated upon the retirement of Republican Mel Martinez in 2010, saying, &quot;I want to be a fighter for Florida with a strong voice that won&#x27;t let the special interests stand in the way of what&#x27;s right.&quot;

On April 2, 2009, Meek announced his intention to qualify for the ballot by petition via collecting 112,476 completed petitions. On April 8, 2010, Meek made history by becoming the first statewide candidate in the history of Florida to qualify for the ballot by petition.

On November 2, 2010, Meek lost in a three-way-race against Governor Charlie Crist, and former Florida House Speaker Marco Rubio, receiving only 20% of the vote.

==Post-congressional career==

In 2011, Meek was nominated to serve as Special Representative to the United Nations by President Barack Obama. In 2016, Meek joined King &amp; Spalding LLP as a senior advisor, where he provides strategic counsel to a wide range of Fortune 500 companies. Since 2023, Meek has been a paid advocate for the fossil fuel industry group, Natural Allies. In this role, he has advocated against the clean energy transition.

==Personal life==

Meek is married to Arshi Siddiqui Meek, CEO of Bellwether Government Affairs and a former, longtime partner at the law firm Akin Gump Strauss &amp; Feld, who also served as senior advisor to Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He has two children, Lauren and Kendrick Jr.

*Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 2002, Michael Italie received 73 votes. In 2006, Eric Simpson received 23 votes.&lt;br&gt;**Under Florida law, a candidate who has no opposition at all in the general election is automatically elected without his or her name being placed on the ballot. In 2008, Meek was automatically elected because he had no general election opponents on the ballot and no write-in candidates filed candidacies against him.

The district is centred on a restaurant/bar/shopping strip along College Street, imprecisely between Harbord Street and Dundas Street, and spreading out east and west between Bathurst Street and Ossington Avenue. It is contained within the larger city-recognized neighbourhood of Palmerston-Little Italy.

==History==

College Street was fully laid out in the area by 1900 and the area was filled with buildings from the early 1900s. College Street is fronted by two- and three-storey buildings, with commercial uses on the ground floor and residential or storage uses on the upper floors.
Italians arrived in Toronto in large numbers during the early 20th century. Italians first settled in an area then known as The Ward, centred on University Avenue and College Street. Approximately 40,000 Italians came to Canada during the interwar period of 1914 to 1918, predominantly from Southern Italy where an economic depression and overpopulation had left many families in poverty. Son to Italian immigrants, Johnny Lombardi was born in The Ward in 1915, and went on to found one of the first multilingual radio stations in Canada, CHIN in 1966, in Palmerston–Little Italy. By the 1920s, most Italians had moved west of Bathurst Street and the College-Clinton area had emerged as the city&#x27;s major Little Italy. They mainly immigrated to Toronto—increasing from 4,900 Italians in 1911, to 9,000 in 1921, constituting almost two percent of Toronto&#x27;s population.

A tourist attraction of the area is the Italian Walk of Fame. Granite and brass stars line the sidewalk with the names of noteworthy Italian Canadians. At Clinton Street, on the north side, is the Royal Cinema, which was recently renovated and has an upgraded projection system as it is used for movie editing purposes during the day and repertory cinema in the evenings. While the commercial units are dominated by cafes and restaurants, there are numerous other small businesses serving the neighbourhood.

The side streets are mostly detached or semi-detached single family homes dating to the early-1900s Edwardian period, with front porches and smaller lots, as was the custom at the time.

As early as 1961, the presence of new immigrants had already started changing Little Italy. That year, 15,000 Italians, 12,000 being immigrants, lived in Little Italy (35 percent of the population), declining to 8,000 in 1971, and further to 3,600 in 1991 (13 percent of the population). Since the 1970s, Italian immigrants from Little Italy moved northward to Corso Italia on St. Clair Avenue West. Much of the Italian population subsequently moved to the suburbs northwest of Toronto, in particular, Vaughan, King, and Caledon. Although the character of the neighbourhood is still has several Italian restaurants and bakeries, the demographics of this neighbourhood have changed drastically with a smaller Italian population than originally.

<doc id="411238" wikidata="Q265791" url="?curid=411238" title="Ileana Ros-Lehtinen">
<text>Ileana Ros-Lehtinen ( ; ; born July 15, 1952) is an American politician and lobbyist from Miami, Florida, who represented from 1989 to 2019. By the end of her tenure, she was the most senior U.S. Representative from Florida. She was Chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee from 2011–2013. In 1989, Ros-Lehtinen won a special election and became the first Cuban American elected to Congress. She was also the first Republican woman elected to the House from Florida. Ros-Lehtinen gave the first Republican response to the State of the Union address in Spanish in 2011, and gave the third in 2014.

In September 2011, Ros-Lehtinen became the first Republican member of the U.S. Congress to co-sponsor the Respect for Marriage Act, which would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act. In July 2012, Ros-Lehtinen became the first Republican in the House to support same-sex marriage.

On April 30, 2017, Ros-Lehtinen announced that she would not be running for re-election in 2018.

==Early life and education==
Ileana Ros y Adato was born in Havana, Cuba, one of two children born to Enrique Ros (1924–2013), who later became a businessman and anti–Fidel Castro activist, and his wife, Amanda Adato. The family immigrated to the United States when Ileana was seven years old. She graduated from Southwest Miami Senior High School. She received her Bachelor of Arts in education and her Master of Arts in educational leadership from Florida International University. She attended the University of Miami, where she earned an Ed.D in higher education.

Ros-Lehtinen was raised Catholic and is now an Episcopalian. Ros-Lehtinen&#x27;s maternal grandparents were Sephardic Jews, originally from the Ottoman Empire, who had been active in Cuba&#x27;s Jewish community. Her maternal grandfather left the city of Kırklareli for Cuba in 1913, fleeing the devastation and economic collapse caused by the First Balkan War. Her mother later converted to Catholicism to marry her father.

==Career==

Ros-Lehtinen was an educator and the owner/operator of a private school in Miami-Dade County. She was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 1982, where she met State Representative Dexter Lehtinen (D-Miami). They married on June 9, 1984, after Dexter switched parties. They both served in the State House until 1986. That year, they were both elected to the Florida Senate, where he was elected to District 40 and she was elected in District 34. In 1988, Dexter Lehtinen resigned his seat to become U.S. Attorney of South Florida. In 1989, Ros-Lehtinen resigned her seat to become a U.S. Representative.

===U.S. House of Representatives===
After incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Claude Pepper died on May 30, 1989, there was a special election scheduled for August 29, 1989. State Senator Ros-Lehtinen defeated Democrat Gerald Richman 53%–47%. She was the first Cuban American elected to the United States Congress and the first Republican woman elected from Florida. Upon her election, Ros-Lehtinen was incorrectly informed that she was also the first Latina elected to Congress, the first having been Rep. Barbara Vucanovich, who was of partial Mexican descent and was elected in 1982. In 1990, she won re-election to a full term with 60% of the vote. In total, she was elected to fourteen full terms, never winning with less than 58%.

Ros-Lehtinen joined Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Maryland) on a congressional delegation to the United Nations in order to encourage international support for an end to the genocide in Darfur. In addition, when Ros-Lehtinen returned from a trip to Darfur in April 2007 where she visited Sudanese refugee camps, she strongly encouraged the United States and the international community to find a solution to this humanitarian crisis.

Following the 2008 elections, then President-elect Barack Obama rang Ros-Lehtinen to congratulate her on her re-election. She hung up on him, believing that it was a prank call from a radio station. She did the same to Obama&#x27;s chief of staff Rahm Emanuel when he rang to confirm the original call was genuine, and only accepted the call after Congressman Howard Berman managed to speak to her.

Ros-Lehtinen played a key role in keeping the International Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act of 2010 from being passed into law. Although the bill had unanimously passed the Senate with bipartisan support, she persuaded enough Republicans in the House to vote against the bill so that it did not receive the required two-thirds majority. She reportedly invoked concerns about the legislation&#x27;s cost and that funds could be used to promote abortion.

Ros-Lehtinen was Chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee from 2011–2013. During the 2011 Libyan civil war, she expressed support of the Libyan opposition; on February 26, 2011, she released a press release which stated, &quot;stronger penalties must be imposed in order to hold the regime accountable for its heinous crimes, and to prevent further violence against the Libyan people&quot;. But on March 20, 2011, the day after the NATO strikes to enforce the no-fly-zone began, she expressed a different view in a press release: &quot;I am concerned that the President has yet to clearly define for the American people what vital United States security interests he believes are currently at stake in Libya.&quot; The congresswoman has also been a forerunner in cutting U.S. aid to foreign lands, including the State Department, The Peace Corps, the Asia Foundation, the U.S. Institute of Peace and the East–West Center. She also advocates cutting funding to Lebanese Armed Forces and the West Bank and Gaza.

After comments by State Department over Israeli settlements, she demanded that the Obama administration halt its &quot;condemnations&quot; of &quot;an indispensable ally and friend of the United States.&quot; In September 2011, she introduced a bill to cut off US funding to any UN organization that recognises Palestinian statehood.

Ros-Lehtinen has been an opponent of funding for the Peace Corps. In 2011, she led a hearing about the perils that volunteers faced and the lack of concern for victims of sexual abuse while serving. Ros-Lehtinen pressured the State Department to accelerate its processing of passports, something that had hindered American citizens&#x27; travel during the crucial summer travel season. Calling the delay &quot;outrageous, incomprehensible, unconscionable&quot; at a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where she is chairwoman, Ros-Lehtinen brought the pressure of committee Republicans to bear on the State Department&#x27;s Bureau of Consular Affairs and spur them to action.

On May 7, 2014, Ros-Lehtinen introduced the Venezuelan Human Rights and Democracy Protection Act (H.R. 4587; 113th Congress) in the House. The bill would impose sanctions against Venezuela and authorize appropriations to support civil society in that country. The sanctions would be directed at any government official who was involved in the mistreatment of protestors. Ros-Lehtinen said that the bill was to &quot;condemn the ongoing human rights abuses being committed in Venezuela, and to answer the cries of the people of Venezuela.&quot; Ros-Lehtinen also said that she was &quot;pleased that the House of Representatives has acted to punish the thugs of the Maduro regime for brutally repressing and violating the human rights of those seeking to exercise their basic freedoms of speech and assembly in Venezuela.&quot;

She was a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership.

===Notable campaign contributors===
A major individual campaign contributor to Ros-Lehtinen is Irving Moskowitz, a funder of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The lobby group J Street has called on Ros-Lehtinen to return campaign contributions from Moskowitz, saying he &quot;actively undermines the two-state solution and the foreign policy of the United States by funding illegal settlements in the occupied territories&quot;. American Council on World Jewry president Jack Rosen has &quot;great concern&quot; about this demand.

==Political positions==
A leading Republican moderate, Ros-Lehtinen opposed Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential candidacy. In April 2017, she called on President Trump to remove Steve Bannon from his position as chief strategist in the Trump administration. As of May 2018, Ros-Lehtinen had voted with her party in 85.7% of votes in the 115th United States Congress and voted in line with President Trump&#x27;s position in 68.7% of the votes.

The &quot;National Journal&quot;, as cited in the Almanac of American Politics 2016, gave Ros-Lehtinen a composite score of 54% conservative and 46% liberal. Ros-Lehtinen was ranked as the sixth most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress in the Bipartisan Index, created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy to assess congressional bipartisanship. During the first session of the 115th United States Congress, Ros-Lehtinen&#x27;s ranking improved to second.

===Economic issues===
She signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge. Ros-Lehtinen voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 in its initial September 29, 2008 vote, which failed, but voted in favor of the revised bill in its October 3, 2008 vote, which passed.

In February 2017, she voted against a resolution that would have directed the House to request 10 years of Trump&#x27;s tax returns, which would then have been reviewed by the House Ways and Means Committee in a closed session. Ros-Lehtinen voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. According to one estimate, 39,900 of Ros-Lehtinen&#x27;s constituents could lose their health insurance in 2019 due to the bill&#x27;s passage.

===Foreign policy===
Ros-Lehtinen was rated 57% conservative and 43% liberal on foreign policy issues by the &quot;National Journal&quot;. Ros-Lehtinen supported President George W. Bush&#x27;s surge policy in Iraq, supports Israel, and supports continued sanctions against Cuba. She also supported the de facto government in Honduras, headed by Roberto Micheletti, that emerged after the military coup against President Manuel Zelaya. She has said of the decision to invade Iraq: &quot;Whether or not there is a direct link to the World Trade Center does not mean that Iraq is not meritorious of shedding blood. The common link is that they hate America.&quot;

On November 23, 2010, she called on the Obama administration to &quot;announce publicly, right now, that we will stay away from Durban III, deny it US taxpayer dollars, and oppose all measures that seek to facilitate it. And we should encourage other responsible nations to do the same.&quot;

Ros-Lehtinen opposes US support to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and the Palestinian Authority. She describes herself as a &quot;strong supporter of Israel&quot; and regards the U.S. relationship with Israel as &quot;critical to the national security interests of both nations&quot;. Ros-Lehtinen supported President Donald Trump&#x27;s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital.

====Cuba====
Ros-Lehtinen played a prominent role in the Cuban-American lobby, which puts pressure on the Cuban government to bring about political change in Cuba. She was a member of the Congressional Cuba Democracy Caucus. Ros-Lehtinen also advanced strongly held views on Cuba, and lobbied against ending the United States embargo against that country. In 2004 she formed the Cuba Democracy Group aimed at curtailing U.S. agriculture exports and preventing U.S. banks from doing business with the Cuban government.

Ros-Lehtinen has defended former fugitive Velentin Hernández, convicted of murdering Luciano Nieves, a fellow Cuban exile who supported negotiations with the Cuban government, In the 1980s, Ros-Lehtinen lobbied for the release and pardon of Cuban exile Orlando Bosch, who had been convicted of terrorist acts and has also been accused of involvement in the 1976 bombing of Cubana Flight 455, which killed 73 people, helping organize an &quot;Orlando Bosch day&quot; to gain support for his release. Ros-Lehtinen played a prominent role in the unsuccessful attempt by relatives of Elian Gonzalez to gain custody of six-year-old from the Castro regime, describing Cuba as &quot;that system of godless communism&quot;. She also attempted to block Jimmy Carter&#x27;s visit to the island in 2002.

Ros-Lehtinen stirred controversy by calling for the assassination of Cuban leader Fidel Castro. She appeared in a British documentary, which was entitled &quot;638 Ways to Kill Castro&quot;, saying: &quot;I welcome the opportunity of having anyone assassinate Fidel Castro and any leader who is oppressing the people.&quot; After a 28-second clip began circulating on the Internet, she claimed the filmmakers spliced clips together to get the sound bite. Twenty-four hours after the controversy erupted, director Dollan Cannell sent unedited tapes of his interview with Ros-Lehtinen to reporters. The uncut version contradicted her response, showing she had twice welcomed an attempt on Castro&#x27;s life. Although she attempted to distance herself from her denial, filmmaker Cannell requested an apology.

===Immigration and refugees===
Ros-Lehtinen opposed President Donald Trump&#x27;s 2017 executive order to temporarily curtail Muslim immigration until better screening methods are devised. She stated that &quot;I object to the suspension of visas from the seven named countries because we could have accomplished our objective of keeping our homeland safe by immediate implementation of more thorough screening procedures.&quot;

===Abortion===

In 2003, she received a 0% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America. In 2006, she received a 100% rating from the National Right to Life Committee for her abortion-related voting record. She is against allowing federal funds and federal health coverage for abortions. She wants to stop embryonic stem cell research. She has voted to make it a crime to harm a fetus while committing a crime. She is against partial-birth abortions unless it is necessary to save the mother&#x27;s life. She has voted to ban minors from being transported to receive an abortion and wants to prohibit minors from traveling over state lines for abortions.

===Drug policy===

Ros-Lehtinen has a &quot;B&quot; rating from NORML for her voting history regarding cannabis-related causes. Ros-Lehtinen supports veterans having access to medical marijuana if recommended by their Veterans Health Administration doctor and if it is legal for medicinal purposes in their state of residence.

=== LGBT issues ===
Ros-Lehtinen has been a notable Republican voice in favor of LGBT rights. In a Winter 2013 interview with the Human Rights Campaign, she stated that her support for same-sex marriage was based on &quot;coming from Cuba, losing my homeland to communism, seeing the state control everything—I&#x27;m a person that believes in individual liberties and not having the government control everything.&quot; When asked about her support for her son Rodrigo, a transgender LGBT rights advocate, Ros-Lehtinen commented that:

It&#x27;s important for families to support their children and to support their children&#x27;s choices. It&#x27;s important to listen to your children, accept your children and have your children know that you love them unconditionally. It&#x27;s not &quot;I love you, but ...&quot;—there&#x27;s no &quot;but.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s just &quot;I love you.&quot;... To do otherwise is—you&#x27;re hurting yourself, you&#x27;re going to shun your child or grandchild. You&#x27;re going to say, &quot;No, I have my views and my views are the perfect views and no one can have a different point of view. I&#x27;m right and everything else is wrong.&quot; And that&#x27;s a lonely way to live. It just means you&#x27;ll be out of that person&#x27;s life, and who wants to be cut out of their child&#x27;s life?

Although Ros-Lehtinen voted for the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, she began to support LGBT issues over the following decade (due in part to her district, which includes large LGBT populations in South Beach in Miami Beach and in the Florida Keys, as well as Rodrigo coming out). She was one of three Republican members of the LGBT Equality Caucus, of which she is a founding member and a vice-chairwoman. While she is not a co-sponsor of the Uniting American Families Act, she supports anti-hate crime laws, anti-discrimination bills, believes gays and lesbians should be allowed to serve openly in the armed forces, is a sponsor of the Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act, and voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment. Ros-Lehtinen was one of fifteen Republican House members to vote in favor of the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010, and was the first Republican cosponsor of the bill.

In September 2011, Ros-Lehtinen became the first Republican member of the U.S. Congress to co-sponsor the Respect for Marriage Act, and signed on to a letter to IRS Commissioner Schulman requesting that the IRS provide clear guidance for LGBT taxpayers. The letter asks the IRS to ensure that tax law is being applied fairly to all individuals. In July 2012, she became the first Republican in the House to fully support same-sex marriage. In 2013, Ros-Lehtinen was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; case.

== Post-congressional career ==
Ros-Lehtinen has remained active in politics since leaving office, endorsing the Republican campaign of María Elvira Salazar for her old congressional seat in 2020. She donated to the congressional reelection campaign of Democrat Frederica Wilson in 2022.

=== Lobbying career ===
After leaving Congress, Ros-Lehtinen was hired by the lobbying firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld (Akin Gump). In 2024, she was among the Akin Gump lobbyists hired by Nippon Steel to navigate the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel.

==== United Arab Emirates lobbying controversy ====
At Akin Gump, she has worked as a foreign agent for the government of the United Arab Emirates. In July 2020, she was involved in the Emirates’ attempt of defaming the regional rival Qatar, where a report of 124 pages was published by her. Entitled &quot;Report Concerning Qatar’s Al Jazeera Media Network &amp; The Foreign Agents Registration Act&quot;, the report submitted to the FARA claimed that the media agency &quot;Al Jazeera&quot; was funded, owned, directed and controlled by Qatar. Both the lobbying firm and Ros were putting efforts on behalf of the UAE to crush the global influence of Al Jazeera.

=== Department of Justice investigation ===
In September 2020, the US Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section opened an investigation into allegations against Ileana Ros that she misused campaign funds. She allegedly used the funds for personal expenses and vacations, where expense reports from a political action committee showed $4,000 spent on a trip to Walt Disney World with family in December 2017 and another transaction of $3,100 at a restaurant on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 2018.

==Personal life==
In 1984, Ros-Lehtinen married Dexter Lehtinen, a former attorney for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District, with whom she has two children, Rodrigo, a transgender LGBT rights activist, and Patricia Marie. She is also step-mother to Katherine and Douglas Lehtinen. She is an Episcopalian.

<doc id="411241" wikidata="Q983116" url="?curid=411241" title="Robert Wexler">
<text>Robert Ira Wexler (born January 2, 1961) is an American politician and lawyer from Florida. He is the president of the Washington-based S. Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East Peace. Wexler was a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing , from 1997 until his resignation on January 3, 2010.

==Early life==
Wexler was born in Queens, New York to Ben and Sandra Wexler. He and his family moved to South Florida when he was ten. Wexler graduated from Hollywood Hills High School in Hollywood, Florida and later attended Emory University for a year. He transferred to the University of Florida, where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1982. Wexler received his J.D. degree from The George Washington University Law School in 1985 and was a lawyer in private practice with Shutts &amp; Bowen before serving in the House.

==Political career==
Wexler served in the Florida Senate from 1990 to 1996 before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1996 election, filling the open seat vacated by fellow Democrat Harry Johnston. He has been reelected six times, never facing serious opposition in one of the most Democratic districts in Florida. On January 3, 2010, he resigned to become executive director of the Center for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation, a Washington-based think tank.

===Matzoh pricing===
In April 1997, Wexler asked that an investigation be started to determine why the price of matzoh, the unleavened bread that is a staple at Jewish tables during Passover, varied so much throughout the country. &quot;It&#x27;s the biggest thing since the Jewish people escaped from Pharaoh and Egypt&quot;, Wexler said while also advising his constituents to &quot;Get your family and friends to buy five-pound boxes in the Bronx and FedEx it down here.&quot;

===Wexler announces support for impeachment hearings===
In an e-mail to supporters on November 7, 2007, Representative Robert Wexler, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, stated about H.Res. 333:

In mid December 2007, Congressman Wexler launched a website (&quot;Wexlerwantshearings.com&quot;) to promote his effort for impeachment hearings. The site included a YouTube video where he explained his position and a petition for like-minded people to sign. Wexler set a goal of getting 50,000 Americans to join his cause. In just two weeks, over 200,000 people signed the petition and over 70,000 people watched his YouTube video.

===Call for McClellan testimony===
After the release of the book &quot;What Happened&quot; by former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan in June 2008, Wexler went on record as saying he would like McClellan to testify under oath about what Wexler depicted as crimes of the Bush administration. The Bush administration had claimed that such proceedings would be a violation of executive privilege. At the time, Wexler was a member of the House Judiciary Committee. Scott McClellan offered his testimony to the House Judiciary Committee on June 20, 2008.

===Articles of impeachment===

On June 10, 2008, Wexler co-sponsored and signed Dennis Kucinich&#x27;s articles of impeachment for George W. Bush. He referred to the congressional oath of office saying it was the duty of Congress to act, and stated: &quot;President Bush deliberately created a massive propaganda campaign to sell the war in Iraq to the American people and the charges detailed in this impeachment resolution indicate an unprecedented abuse of executive power.&quot; However, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi repeatedly said she would not support a resolution calling for Bush&#x27;s impeachment, saying such a move was unlikely to succeed and would be divisive.

The House voted 251 to 166 to refer the impeachment resolution to the Judiciary Committee on July 25, 2008, where no further action was taken on it.

===Residency dispute===

In July 2008, Fox news host Bill O&#x27;Reilly revealed that Wexler claimed his mother-in-law&#x27;s home in Delray Beach as his official residence (though he is listed on the House roll as &quot;D-Boca Raton&quot;), but lived in a Maryland suburb for most of the year. Edward J. Lynch, a Republican running for Wexler&#x27;s congressional seat, researched Wexler&#x27;s living arrangements and took his argument to the Fox News program. &quot;The house he lists on his voter registration is his in-laws&#x27; house, in a gated 55-and-older community ... Legally, he can&#x27;t move back with children under 18.&quot;

After Wexler was confronted about the allegation, he stated that his mother-in-law did own the house in Delray Beach. But he also said he stayed there when in Florida which, according to his office is, on average, about twice a month. As a Florida resident, Wexler did not pay personal income tax, and his vehicles were also registered in that state, despite his near-permanent residency in the Washington metropolitan area.

==Committee assignments and caucus memberships==
*Committee on Foreign Affairs
**Subcommittee on Europe (chairman)
**Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight
**Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia
*Committee on the Judiciary
**Subcommittee on Courts and Competition Policy

===Caucus memberships=== 
The following is a partial list of Wexler&#x27;s congressional caucus memberships:
*Congressional Caucus on Global Road Safety (co-founder and co-chairman)
*Caucus on U.S.-Turkish Relations (co-founder)
*Taiwan Caucus (co-founder)
*Caucus on Intellectual Property Promotion and Piracy Prevention (co-founder/co-chairman)
*Indonesia Caucus (co-founder/co-chairman)
*Congressional Study Group on Turkey (co-chair)
*Congressional Progressive Caucus
*India Caucus
*Serbia Caucus

==Notable media appearances==

===&quot;Colbert Report&quot; interview===
Congressman Wexler&#x27;s multiple appearances on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; have elevated him to status of being a bona fide &quot;friend of the show.&quot; On the July 20, 2006, episode, during an interview for the segment &quot;Better Know a District&quot;, Wexler went along with Stephen Colbert&#x27;s idea of making jokes about the use of cocaine. This arose from a discussion about Wexler&#x27;s running re-election unopposed and therefore, impliedly, not having to choose his words as carefully as he otherwise would. Led by Stephen Colbert, he first repeated what Colbert had said, then completed with the following statements:

&quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;The Today Show&quot; (the ABC and NBC morning shows), and &quot;Fox News&quot; aired edited versions of the segment. In response, on the July 25, 2006, episode of his show, Colbert castigated those shows for broadcasting edited versions of the interview in what he said was a misleading and negative light. He told his viewers to &quot;vote Wexler, the man&#x27;s got a sense of humor, unlike, evidently, journalists.&quot;

On November 7, 2006, Wexler returned to &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; during the show&#x27;s &quot;Midterm Midtacular&quot; special and joked about what he said in the earlier interview. When Colbert asked him if he would &quot;reach across the aisle&quot; if the Democrats took back the House, he was cautious and joked that he learned from the last interview he had to watch what he said.

===&quot;The Hill&quot;===
In August and September 2006, Wexler and his office staff were featured on &quot;The Hill&quot;, a six-part documentary on the Sundance Channel.

===&quot;Daily Show&quot; - Defunding of UNESCO===
On the March 15, 2012 episode of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, John Oliver interviewed Wexler, who defended the United States&#x27; cutting its funding to UNESCO, based upon a statute that prohibits funding of organizations which recognize Palestinian statehood. These cuts will result in the reduction or elimination of certain humanitarian programs administered by UNESCO. Wexler indicated that the cut in funding is necessary to &quot;send a message&quot; to organizations that support Palestinian statehood.

==Family==
Wexler and his wife Laurie (née Cohen) have three children.

==Election results==
Wexler ran unopposed in the 1998, 2004, and the 2006 elections.

<doc id="411243" wikidata="Q14875342" url="?curid=411243" title="New Toronto">
<text>New Toronto is a neighbourhood and former municipality in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the south-west area of Toronto, along Lake Ontario. The Town of New Toronto was established in 1890, and was designed and planned as an industrial centre by a group of industrialists from Toronto who had visited Rochester, New York. New Toronto was originally a part of the Township of Etobicoke. It was an independent municipality from 1913 to 1967, being one of the former &#x27;Lakeshore Municipalities&#x27; amalgamated into the Borough of Etobicoke, and eventually amalgamated into Toronto. The neighbourhood has retained the name.

== Boundaries ==
New Toronto is bounded by Lake Ontario to the south, with a western boundary of Twenty Third Street (south of Lake Shore Blvd. West) and the midpoint between Twenty-Second and Twenty-Fourth Streets (north of Lake Shore Blvd. West), the Canadian National Railway mainline to the north, and Dwight Avenue to the east. To the east is the neighbourhood of Mimico and the neighbourhood of Long Branch is to the west.

==Character==
New Toronto is now centred around the intersection of Seventh Street/ Islington Avenue and Lake Shore Boulevard West with a commercial strip running east–west along the latter street. Residential streets generally run north–south from Lake Ontario north to Birmingham Street, except for the Lakeshore Grounds (formerly the Mimico Lunatic Asylum / Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital) to the southwest which extends from Lake Shore Blvd. West south to the Lake. North of Birmingham Street has historically been a large industrial district, although many industries moved or closed in the period from 1987 to 1991.

New Toronto is now a neighbourhood in transition, as the industrial corridor located at the north end of the community is being redeveloped after having been vacant and fallow for many years. Industry that gradually moved out of New Toronto over the years is now being re-established, in addition to institutional uses.

Lakeshore Village, a community of co-operative housing between 9th and 13th Streets, north of Lake Shore Boulevard. West, was built by The Daniels Corp. developers, on the former Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company site. The loss of the former employment base resulted in a considerable downtrend in local business viability, which the lower-income housing could never replace.

In September 2009, the new Toronto Police College training facility opened at 70 Birmingham St., and also houses a 22 Division Police Substation. This is the site of the former Continental Can Company of Canada Ltd. New Toronto Plant.

In 1890, new streets for the Town of New Toronto were laid out in several series, essentially without names by simply using ordinal numbers (First, Second, Third, etc.). When the streets were laid out along Lake Shore Road (now Lake Shore Blvd. West), they had a single new starting point. The second numbering system began with First Street being one half-block west of Dwight Ave (the boundary street between the Town of Mimico and New Toronto) and continuing westward. Originally named &quot;Mimico Avenue&quot;, and for most of the 20th century as &quot;Eighteenth Street&quot; (officially, until the 1980s), Kipling Avenue is the westernmost north–south major road. The street-number naming convention was later applied to streets further west of New Toronto in the Village of Long Branch when their streets were renamed in 1931.

==History==
===Establishment===
The largest farming families in what would become New Toronto were the Northcote family to the east (south of Lake Shore Blvd. West at Seventh Street/Islington Avenue today), and the Goldthorpe family to the west at Mimico Avenue (now Kipling Avenue), where the Mimico Lunatic Asylum was later built.

In the 1880s, the Goldthorpe farm south of the Lake Shore Road Lake Shore Boulevard West and east of Mimico Avenue was purchased by the Ontario Government. In 1888, it became the location of the Mimico Lunatic Asylum (later known as the Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital.) It was built to alleviate overcrowding at Toronto&#x27;s Asylum on Queen Street West (later known as Queen Street Mental Health Centre, and now the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health).

In 1890, a plan of subdivision was filed by a group of industrialists and the first streets laid out for the Town of New Toronto by the Mimico Real Estate Security Company. With the first industries in New Toronto already operating, or to be operational by the end of 1890, New Toronto was promoted with the publication of an article in the edition of October 25, 1890 of the Toronto &quot;Globe&quot; newspaper (now the Globe &amp; Mail) entitled &quot;Toronto&#x27;s Growing Suburb – New Toronto – As it is and what it will be&quot;. New Toronto, as an industrial centre &quot;was expected to rival – if not exceed – &#x27;old&#x27; Toronto in manufacturing output&quot;. A few worker&#x27;s homes were built on early streets north of Lake Shore Road while development proceeded.

New Toronto was planned and designed as a &quot;town&quot;, with manufacturing as its focal point, but also including retail business and residential areas in the plan. The Town of New Toronto would become a fully independent, self-sufficient municipality.

John Sheane&#x27;s Hotel (later, The New Toronto Hotel and the Almont Hotel) was located across from the Asylum grounds at Mimico Avenue (Kipling Ave.) and the Lake Shore Road (now Lake Shore Blvd West). In 1892, a post office was established in New Toronto. The next year, the pastor of Mimico&#x27;s Methodist Church began holding separate services in New Toronto, establishing a church building as a branch of Mimico&#x27;s new Methodist Circuit in 1909.

The Mimico Yard (the former Grand Trunk Railway freight yard) was established in 1906, encouraging many more industries to relocate to New Toronto. The same year a public school was established on Sixth Street. A proper school house was opened in 1909 on Fifth Street (Fifth Street Public School). By 1911, an Anglican church had been completed in New Toronto called St. Margaret&#x27;s.

While some early factory housing was built on Sixth Street, and later Fifth Street, little residential development in New Toronto took place until after World War I. Farming was still prevalent south of the Lake Shore Road. Although some realtors began to advertise subdivisions for housing around 1910, it still took at least a decade until a sufficient base of local retail stores existed to support a permanent local population.

===Town of New Toronto (1913–1967)===
In 1913, New Toronto was incorporated as a separate village, with a population of 500. In 1915 the Methodist church became a separate Methodist Parish from Mimico. 1916 saw a referendum on joining New Toronto to Mimico which passed in Mimico but was defeated by New Toronto residents.

With the First World War raging, new industries arrived in New Toronto - most notably Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company established a plant in 1916-17 which quickly became the town&#x27;s largest employer. Other major industries included: E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company &#x27;Fabrikoid&#x27; plant (1915, later renamed as &quot;Canadian Industries Limited&quot;), Anaconda American Brass Company of Canada (1922, after taking over the operations of Browns Copper &amp; Brass Rolling Mills Ltd., 1915), Campbell Soup Co. of Canada (1930), W &amp; A Gilbey Ltd. distillery (1933), and the Continental Can Company of Canada Ltd. (1936).

In 1919 Loblaws introduced their &quot;self-shopping&quot; concept with the first Loblaw Groceteria at 2879 Lake Shore Boulevard West in New Toronto.

New Toronto became a fully independent municipality (town) in 1920 and established a Library Association. In 1924 a St. Teresa&#x27;s Catholic Church was created in New Toronto out of Mimico&#x27;s St. Leo&#x27;s Catholic Church.

By 1927 a new school was needed and Seventh Street Public school was opened.

With the creation of the United Church of Canada after the union of the Methodist, Congregational and Presbyterian Churches, the New Toronto Methodist Church opened a new church building, the first to be built specifically as a United Church, called the Century United Church.

In 1929, the New Toronto fire station was built. Designed in an Italianate style, it was also used as the Town Hall for a time. It is still a fire station today. At the same time, the new mayor William Jackson donated land for a Public Library Building. Jackson would go on to be mayor almost continuously until 1952. In 1930, the Campbell Soup Company Ltd. had arrived in New Toronto commissioning architects Mathers and Holdenby to build an Art Deco factory at 60 Birmingham Street (c. 1931). In 1947 the Fifth Street Public School burned down and was replaced with the new Second Street Public School. The former Fifth St. Public School was then rebuilt to become the Town of New Toronto Town Hall.

Because of New Toronto&#x27;s large industrial base, a new high school was needed to educate and train future workers for industry. In 1951, New Toronto Secondary School (NTSS) was opened. The curriculum of NTSS focused on the sciences and skilled trades (i.e. calculus, functions, geometry, physics, biology, auto mechanics, woodworking, machine shop, electrical shops; to name some of the major study areas).

In 1953 the Town of Mimico, Town of New Toronto, Village of Long Branch, Etobicoke Township, Village of Swansea, Village of Forest Hill, Town of Weston, Town of Leaside, East York Township, North York Township, York Township, Scarborough Township and City of Toronto joined together to create a new common level of government: Metropolitan Toronto (Metro). Each municipality retained its own town council and government, but several infrastructure departments were transferred to Metro. This lasted until 1967, when the number of municipalities in Metro was reduced.

In New Toronto, to serve the large local population of Ukrainians who had settled in the area over the years, St. Michael&#x27;s Ukrainian Catholic Church was built in 1954 on Sixth Street (just north of St. Margaret&#x27;s Anglican Church). While many Ukrainian and Polish immigrants lived in New Toronto and surrounding communities beginning early in the 20th century, more arrived after the Communist Bloc collapsed in 1989.

Growing freight traffic in the Toronto area necessitated the creation of an amalgamated facility and a by-pass of the congested Toronto Terminal downtown. In 1965, a new rail freight facility, first named Toronto Yard and then MacMillan Yard, was opened north of Metro Toronto. The local Mimico Railway Yard was downgraded considerably, resulting in the dislocation of much railway employment. At the same time the Toronto By-Pass line allowed for the creation of GO Transit commuter service between Oakville and Pickering. GO named its facility Willowbrook, after the nearby Willowbrook Road. Old CNR facilities in Mimico Yard were used for the startup of this trial train service. Its subsequent growth has resulted in new facilities being built for GO. In 1985, Via Rail facilities at Spadina Avenue were relocated from downtown Toronto to New Toronto&#x27;s underused former Mimico Yards at the newly completed Toronto Maintenance Centre (which would have its major operations moved to Quebec just a few years later).

===Post-annexation (1967–present)===

In 1967, the Town of New Toronto was amalgamated with the other Lake Shore municipalities (Town of Mimico and Village of Long Branch) with Etobicoke to create the new Borough of Etobicoke. Etobicoke later became a city in 1984. In 1998, Etobicoke was amalgamated with the other municipalities of Metropolitan Toronto to form the current City of Toronto.

An upheaval came in May 1987. Goodyear Canada Inc., which was the largest employer in New Toronto, shut down its plant contributing to a general loss of employment in the area. The lands are now the site of several co-operative housing buildings, townhouses, condos, and a park. New Toronto&#x27;s library branch was demolished in 1993 to be replaced with a new building.

Recent attempts to rejuvenate New Toronto include the protection of remaining industrial lands for employment. The former Mimico Lunatic Asylum buildings and grounds became the new site of Humber College&#x27;s Lake Shore campus. The new Lakeshore Lions Arena was constructed on the former W &amp; A Gilbey distillery site.

==Education==
New Toronto is also home to Humber College&#x27;s Lakeshore campus. The college is a public post-secondary institution. The Lakeshore Campus is located on the former grounds of the Mimico Lunatic Asylum (later renamed the Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital), at the foot of Kipling Avenue (originally Eighteenth Street).

In addition to post-secondary schooling, two public school boards operate institutions within New Toronto, the Toronto District School Board (TDSB), and the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB). Both school boards provide primary and secondary schooling.

TDSB is a secular public school board for the city, and operates one secondary school in the neighbourhood, Lakeshore Collegiate Institute, originally New Toronto Secondary School. The secondary school opened in 1951. Its purpose was to provide technical education to students who would either go on to university or enter the skilled trades, as the school&#x27;s focus was on technical shops and science education, whereas Mimico High School was business-oriented. The Lakeshore district experienced a constant heightened demand for skilled trades due to the numerous major industries and supporting businesses located there. New Toronto Secondary School was expanded in 1965 to accommodate a growing student population.
The school merged with Alderwood Collegiate Institute to form Lakeshore Collegiate Institute in 1983, due to falling public school enrollment when the Province extended public funding to Catholic high schools. New Toronto&#x27;s building was designed by architect John B. Parkin.
TDSB operates several elementary and middle schools in New Toronto. They include:
* Second Street Junior Middle School is a public elementary school located a few blocks east of the intersection of Seventh Street/ Lake Shore Boulevard West and Islington Avenue. The original school was built in 1949 and a large second storey wheelchair accessible addition was built in 1996 where the previous single-storey wing existed. The school was built because Fifth Street School had burnt down and the students needed a new school. The Fifth Street School became the New Toronto Town Hall, then Metro Police 21 Division station, and then became the Lakeshore Area Multiservices Project (LAMP) in 1973. The City of Toronto is the owner of the building now.
* Seventh Street Junior School is a public elementary school on Seventh Street. The original school opened in 1922. In 1989, a new school was built on the school yard and the old building was then demolished.
* Twentieth Street Junior School is a public elementary school on the corner of Lake Shore Boulevard and Twentieth Street. There has been a school on this site serving the New Toronto community since 1920. In 1993, the original building and its additions were demolished and a new structure was constructed which opened in September 1994. The school is fully accessible and is close to a host of community recreation facilities such as Lakeshore Lions Arena and Gus Ryder Pool. Twentieth Street Junior School is a short walk from Lake Ontario.

TCDSB is a public separate school board for the city, and operates one elementary school in the neighbourhood, St. Teresa Catholic Elementary School. Located on Tenth Street. Prior to its establishment, children attending Catholic schools went to Christ the King Catholic School or St. Leo Catholic Elementary School. St. Teresa&#x27;s school was established in 1957 during a post war population boom in the, then independent, Town of New Toronto, including many families from predominantly Catholic countries, especially Poland.

==Demographics==
In 2016, the New Toronto neighbourhood was home to 11,463 residents. 66% of the population speak English as their first language, 5.2% speak Polish, 2.9% speak Tagalog and 2.5% speak Spanish.

==Transportation==
The Toronto Transit Commission&#x27;s 501 Queen streetcar line, which runs along Lake Shore Boulevard, connects New Toronto to the downtown core. Though Mimico GO Station is nearby and GO Transit trains use track in the northern reaches of the neighbourhood, there is no active railway station in New Toronto. Four TTC bus lines serve the area. The 44 Kipling South, the 110 Islington South and the 944 Kipling South Express routes connect to the Bloor-Danforth subway to the north.

<doc id="411244" wikidata="Q519938" url="?curid=411244" title="Thermal lance">
<text>A thermal lance, thermic lance, oxygen lance, or burning bar is a tool that heats and melts steel in the presence of pressurized oxygen to create very high temperatures for cutting. It consists of a long steel tube packed with alloy steel rods, which serve as fuel; these are sometimes mixed with aluminum rods to increase the heat output.

==Operation==

One end of the tube is placed in a holder and oxygen is fed through the tube. The far end of the tube is pre-heated and lit by an oxyacetylene torch. An intense stream of burning steel is produced at the working end and can be used to cut rapidly through thick materials, including steel and concrete. The tube is consumed by the process within a few minutes.

===Applications===
Often used as a heavy duty demolition tool, the thermic lance is also used to remove seized axles of heavy machinery without damaging the bearings or axle housing. This technique is often used on the pins and axles of large equipment such as cranes, ships, bridges, and sluice-gates. In addition, thermal lancing is used to clean the bottom of steel furnace pots, which accumulate a skull layer of slag and iron during operation.

===Principle of operation===

Steel, in the form of steel wool, can burn at atmospheric (20%) concentrations of oxygen because it has a high surface area-to-mass ratio and relatively low mass, which prevents the heat from being dissipated in the bulk of the material. When the oxygen concentration is increased, steel wool will burn faster. Burning steel wool is simply the rapid oxidation of iron into ; the thermal lance uses steel in the form of rods rather than wool, the rods will burn with a sufficiently high supply of concentrated oxygen.

The temperature at which a thermal lance operates varies depending on the environment. Some estimates put the maximum temperature at , while others calculate it to be .

===Alternative fuels===
Thermal lances have been constructed for demonstration using foodstuffs (including bacon and dried spaghetti) as the fuel instead of steel rods; a supply of pure oxygen is more important to drive rapid oxidation than the fuel being burned.

==History==
Leo Malcher filed for a patent in 1922 entitled &quot;Process of attacking compact mineral material, noncombustible in oxygen&quot;. The patent uses &quot;a suitable disintegrating flux to act upon the material at the point where it is desired to attack it ... the fuel employed in the example to be described is metallic iron, and is arranged in the form of two concentric pipes&quot;. The annulus between the two pipes was filled with a flux (sodium carbonate borax and sodium chloride in equal proportions) and oxygen was supplied through the inner tube.

<doc id="411247" wikidata="Q468252" url="?curid=411247" title="Michael Ancher">
<text>Michael Peter Ancher (9 June 1849 – 19 September 1927) was a Danish realist artist, widely known for his paintings of fishermen, the Skagerak and the North Sea, and other scenes from the Danish fishing community in Skagen.

==Early life and education==

Michael Peter Ancher was born at Rutsker on the island of Bornholm in the Baltic. The son of a local merchant, he attended school in Rønne but was unable to complete his secondary education as his father ran into financial difficulties, forcing him to fend for himself. In 1865, he found work as an apprentice clerk at Kalø Manor near Rønde in eastern Jutland. The following year, he met the painters Theodor Philipsen and Vilhelm Groth who had arrived in the area to paint. Impressed with his own early work, they encouraged him to take up painting as a profession. In 1871, he spent a short period at C.V Nielsen&#x27;s art school as a preliminary to joining the Royal Danish Academy of Art in Copenhagen later in the year. Although he spent some time at the academy, he left in 1875 without graduating.

One of his student companions was Karl Madsen who invited him to travel to Skagen, a small fishing village in the far north of Jutland where Skagerak and North Sea converge. From the mid-1870s, he and Madsen became key members of a group of artists who congregated there each summer, known as the Skagen Painters.

After Ancher first visited Skagen in 1874, he settled there joining the growing society of artists. The colony of painters regularly met in the Brøndums Hotel in Skagen in order to exchange ideas. In 1880 Ancher married fellow painter and Skagen native Anna Brøndum, whose father owned the Brøndums Hotel. In the first years of their marriage, the couple had a home and studio in the &quot;Garden House&quot;, which is now in the garden of the Skagens Museum. After the birth of their daughter Helga in 1883, the family moved to Markvej in Skagen.

==Career==

He achieved his artistic breakthrough in 1879 with the painting &quot;Vil han klare pynten&quot; (&quot;Will He Round the Point?&quot;). Michael Ancher&#x27;s works depict Skagen&#x27;s heroic fishermen and their dramatic experiences at sea, combining realism and classical composition. Key works include &quot;The Lifeboat is Carried Through The Dunes&quot; (1883), &quot;The Crew Are Saved&quot; (1894) and &quot;The Drowned Man&quot; (1896).

Michael Ancher was influenced by his traditional training at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in the 1870s which imposed strict rules for composition. His marriage to Anna Ancher did, however, introduce him to the naturalistic concept of undecorated reproduction of reality and its colours. By combining the pictorial composition of his youth with the teachings of naturalism, Michael Ancher created what has been called modern monumental figurative art, such as &quot;A Baptism&quot;.
Among other places, the works of Anna and Michael Ancher can be seen at the Skagens Museum, , the Frederiksborg Museum, The Hirschsprung Collection, and Ribe Art Museum. Michael Ancher received the Eckersberg Medal in 1889 and in 1894 the Order of the Dannebrog. Originally many of Ancher&#x27;s paintings hung in the dining room of the Brøndums Hotel. The painter P.S. Krøyer conceived the idea of placing paintings by different artists in the wall panels. In 1946 the dining hall was moved to Skagens Museum.

==Michael and Anna Ancher&#x27;s home==

The Skagen residence of Anna and Michael Ancher was purchased in 1884. In 1913, a large studio annex was added to the property and this also forms part of what is on display today. Upon her death in 1935, their daughter, Helga Ancher, left the house and all of its contents to the Helga Ancher Foundation.

In 1967 the home was turned into a museum, the Anchers Hus. The original furniture and paintings created by the Anchers and other Skagen artists are shown in the restored home and studio. Temporary art exhibitions are arranged in &quot;Saxilds Gaard&quot;, another building on the property. This house is filled with displays of paintings by Michael and Anna Ancher as well as those by many other Skagen painters who made up their circle of friends. Today the house is a part of Skagens Kunstmuseer.


==Danish thousand-kroner bill==
Anna and Michael Ancher were featured on the front of the previous series DKK1000 bill. The first version of the bill came into circulation on 18 September 1998, and was then updated on 25 November 2004, adding more security features. The front of the banknote featured a double portrait of Anna and Michael Ancher, derived from two 1884 paintings by Peder Severin Krøyer
which originally hung on the walls in the dining room at Brøndums Hotel.

A collection of almost 4,000 letters between Michael and Anna Ancher and their friends, with comments by the art historian Elisabeth Fabritius, was published as &quot;Anna og Mchael Ancher. Breve og fotografier 1866-1935&quot; I-VI was published by Forlaget Historika. in 2020.

== Newly-discovered Van Gogh copy ==
In 2016, a painting was purchased for $50 at a garage sale in Minnesota, bearing the inscription &#x27;Elimar&#x27;. After speculation that the work was by Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh, it was brought to the Van Gogh Museum in December 2018, who ultimately refused to attribute the painting to Van Gogh. In 2025, the work went under investigation by a team of around 20 experts commissioned by the art research firm LMI Group International, and several pieces of evidence have been put forward to prove the work&#x27;s authenticity; analyzation of the canvas weave, paint pigments and overall characteristics of the style. A strand of human hair was even found embedded in the canvas and was sent to be analyzed. Despite the fact that it came from a human male, efforts to compare its DNA to that of Van Gogh&#x27;s descendants ultimately failed due to its reportedly &quot;degraded state&quot;, as stated by LMI. This research has also given experts the ability to date the work, which was in 1889, during Van Gogh&#x27;s time at the Saint-Paul Asylum in Saint-Rémy.

The LMI Group later stated that the work (now referred to as &#x27;Elimar&#x27;, using the inscription in the bottom right corner) was based on a portrait by Michael Ancher, therefore adding to Van Gogh&#x27;s considerable list of &quot;translations&quot; of other artists&#x27; works (notably Paul Gauguin, Émile Bernard and Jean-François Millet). &quot;Elimar&quot; is probably just the signature of the Danish Amateur painter Henning Elimar, who is likely the real author of the artwork.

<doc id="411248" wikidata="Q149215" url="?curid=411248" title="Ezh">
<text>Ezh (Ʒ ʒ) , also called the &quot;tailed z&quot;, is a letter, notable for its use in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to represent the voiced postalveolar fricative consonant. This sound, sometimes transcribed /zh/, occurs in the pronunciation of in &quot;vision&quot; and &quot;precision&quot; , the in &quot;treasure&quot; , and the in &quot;beige&quot; . 

Ezh is also used as a letter in some orthographies of Laz and Skolt Sami, both by itself, and with a caron (⟨Ǯ⟩ ⟨ǯ⟩). In Laz, these represent voiceless alveolar affricate and its ejective counterpart , respectively. In Skolt Sami they respectively denote partially voiced alveolar and post-alveolar affricates, broadly represented and . It also appears in the orthography of some African languages, for example in the Aja language of Benin and the Dagbani language of Ghana, where the uppercase variant looks like a reflected sigma ⟨Σ⟩. It also appears in the orthography of Uropi.

The zh sound is represented by various letters in different languages, such as the letter ⟨Ž⟩ as used in many Slavic languages, the letter ⟨Ż⟩ as used in Kashubian, the letter ⟨⟩ in a number of Arabic dialects, the Persian alphabet letter ⟨⟩, the Cyrillic letter ⟨⟩, the Devanagari letter (झ़) and the Esperanto letter ⟨Ĵ⟩.

==Origin==

As a phonetic symbol, it originates with Isaac Pitman&#x27;s English Phonotypic Alphabet in 1847, as a &quot;z&quot; with an added hook. The symbol is based on medieval cursive forms of Latin ⟨z⟩, evolving into the blackletter ⟨z⟩ letter. In Unicode, however, the blackletter ⟨⟩ (&quot;tailed z&quot;, German ) is considered a glyph variant of ⟨z⟩, and not an ezh.
Humanist Gian Giorgio Trissino proposed in 1524 a reform of Italian orthography introducing ezh as an uppercase for the sound.

In contexts where &quot;tailed z&quot; is used in contrast to tail-less z, notably in standard transcription of Middle High German, Unicode ⟨ʒ⟩ is sometimes used, strictly speaking incorrectly. Unicode offers ⟨ȥ⟩ &quot;z with hook&quot; as a grapheme for Middle High German coronal fricative instead.

== Similarities to other glyphs ==
=== Yogh ===
In Unicode 1.0, the character was unified with the unrelated character yogh ⟨Ȝ ȝ⟩, which was not correctly added to Unicode until Unicode 3.0. Historically, ezh is derived from Latin ⟨z⟩, but yogh is derived from Latin ⟨g⟩ by way of insular G. The characters look very similar and do not appear alongside each other in any alphabet. To differentiate between the two more clearly, the Oxford University Press and the Early English Text Society extend the uppermost tip of the yogh into a little curvature upward.

===Numeral three===
The ezh looks similar to the common form of the figure three ⟨3⟩. To differentiate between the two characters, ezh includes the sharp zigzag of the letter ⟨z⟩, while the number is usually curved. Some typefaces use a form of ⟨3⟩ with a flat top, very similar (or virtually identical) to an ezh.

In handwritten Cyrillic, the numeral ⟨3⟩ is sometimes written in a form similar to the ezh, so as to distinguish it from the letter ze ⟨З⟩.

=== Hiragana ro ===

Ezh looks similar to the syllabogram ⟨ろ⟩, which is the hiragana form of the Japanese mora &quot;ro&quot;.

===Cyrillic ze and dze===
The Cyrillic letter ze ⟨З з⟩ has a similar body to Ezh and the Abkhazian dze ⟨Ӡ ӡ⟩. As customary, the Cyrillic script has a stiffer structure, but both letters have common roots in historical cursive forms of the Greek letter zeta ⟨Ζ ζ⟩.

However, Latin ezh and Cyrillic ze represent different phonemes: the former generally represents , while the latter represents /z/. Cyrillic uses zhe ⟨Ж ж⟩ for the /ʒ/ phoneme.

==Usage ==
===Language orthographies===
Trissino&#x27;s reform did not prosper in relation to the .

In the IPA it represents the voiced postalveolar fricative consonant. For example: &quot;vision&quot; . It is pronounced as the ⟨s⟩ in &quot;treasure&quot; or the ⟨si⟩ in the word &quot;precision&quot;.

It is used with that value in Uropi.

It is used in the &quot;International Standard&quot; orthography, as devised by Marcel Courthiade for Romani.

It was also used in an obsolete Latin alphabet for writing Komi, where it represented (similar to English ⟨j⟩). In the modern Cyrillic alphabet, this sound is written as &quot;дз&quot;.

It was also used during Latinisation in the USSR in the project of Unified Northern Alphabet and other alphabets of the people of the Soviet Union during the 1920–1930s.

=== Ezh as an abbreviation for dram ===
In Unicode, a standard designed to allow symbols from all writing systems to be represented and manipulated by computers, the ezh is also used as the symbol to represent the abbreviation for dram or drachm, an apothecaries&#x27; system unit of mass. Unicode has no dedicated symbol for dram, but the Unicode code table entry for ezh reads &quot;LATIN SMALL LETTER EZH = dram sign&quot;. The upper-case letter &quot;z&quot; in Blackletter/Fraktur hand, , is also seen used for dram, but this letter is meant to be used in mathematics and phonetics, and is not recommended as an abbreviation for dram.

==Encoding and ligatures==
The Unicode code points are codice_1 for ⟨Ʒ⟩ and codice_2 for ⟨ʒ⟩. Ezh with caron is also precomposed in Unicode with the code points codice_3 for ⟨Ǯ⟩ and codice_4 for ⟨ǯ⟩.

The IPA historically allowed for ezh to be ligatured to other letters; some of these ligatures have been added to the Unicode standard.
*Dezh ligatures ezh with the letter D ().
*Lezh ligatures ezh with the letter L ().
*Tezh ligatures ezh with the letter T ( and ).

<doc id="411255" wikidata="Q956611" url="?curid=411255" title="Clay Shaw">
<text>Clay LaVergne Shaw (March 17, 1913 – August 15, 1974) was an American businessman, military officer, and part-time contact of the Domestic Contact Service (DCS) of the CIA. Shaw is best known for being the only person brought to trial for involvement in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Shaw was ultimately acquitted in 1969 after less than one hour of jury deliberation, but some conspiracy theorists continue to speculate on his possible involvement.

== Background ==

Shaw, a native of Kentwood, Louisiana, was the son of Glaris Lenora Shaw, a United States Marshal, and Alice Shaw. His grandfather had been the sheriff of Tangipahoa Parish. When Shaw was five, his family moved to New Orleans, where he eventually attended Warren Easton High School.

After graduating from high school in 1928, Shaw was hired by Western Union as manager of a local office in New Orleans. In 1935, Western Union transferred him to New York City where he became a district manager. While in New York, Shaw, who wanted to pursue a career as a writer, attended Columbia University. He later left Western Union to pursue a career in public relations, eventually accepting a position with the Keedick Lecture Bureau.

Shaw enlisted in the United States Army at the start of World War II and was assigned to the Medical Corps as a private. He later received an officer&#x27;s commission and was posted to England where he served briefly in a hospital unit. He was transferred to the Quartermaster Corps and served as secretary to the General Staff in England and after the Normandy invasion served in France and Belgium. He was decorated by three nations: the United States with the Legion of Merit and Bronze Star, by France with the &quot;Croix de Guerre&quot; and named &quot;Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre du Merite&quot;, and by Belgium named Knight of the Order of the Crown of Belgium. Shaw was honorably discharged from the United States Army as a major in 1946.

After World War II, Shaw helped start the International Trade Mart in New Orleans, which facilitated the sales of both domestic and imported goods. He was known locally for his efforts to preserve buildings in New Orleans&#x27; historic French Quarter. Shaw was also a published playwright. The best-known of his works, &quot;Submerged&quot; (1929), was co-written with H. Stuart Cottman when both were still high-school students.

On 9 May 1961 Shaw introduced Charles Cabell, Deputy Director of the CIA, at a Foreign Policy Association event in New Orleans.

==Arrest and trial==
New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison prosecuted Shaw on the charge that he and a group of activists, including David Ferrie and Guy Banister, were involved in a conspiracy with elements of the CIA in the John F. Kennedy assassination. Garrison had Shaw arrested on March 1, 1967. By then Banister and Ferrie were both deceased, but Garrison believed that Shaw was the man named as &quot;Clay Bertrand&quot; in the Warren Commission Report. Garrison said that Shaw used the alias of Clay Bertrand in New Orleans&#x27;s gay society.

During the trial, which took place in January and February 1969, Garrison called insurance salesman Perry Russo as his main witness. Russo testified that he had attended a party at the apartment of anti-Castro activist David Ferrie. At the party, Russo said that Lee Harvey Oswald (who Russo said was introduced to him as &quot;Leon Oswald&quot;), Ferrie, and &quot;Clem Bertrand&quot; (who Russo identified in the courtroom as Shaw) had discussed assassinating Kennedy. The conversation included plans for the &quot;triangulation of crossfire&quot; and alibis for the participants.

Critics of Garrison argue that his own records indicate that Russo&#x27;s story had evolved over time. A key source was the &quot;Sciambra Memo&quot;, which recorded Assistant D.A. Andrew Sciambra&#x27;s first interview with Russo. The memo does not mention an &quot;assassination party&quot; and states that Russo met with Shaw on two occasions, neither of which occurred at the party. On March 1, 1969, Shaw was acquitted less than an hour after the case went to the jury.

Shaw denied any part of a conspiracy and said of the slain President: &quot;I was a great admirer of Kennedy. I thought he had given the nation a new turn after the rather drab Eisenhower years ... I felt he was vitally concerned about social issues, which concerned me also. I thought he had youth, imagination, style, and élan. All in all, I considered him a splendid president.&quot;

==Death==
A heavy cigarette smoker for most of his life, Shaw died at the age of 61 at his home on August 15, 1974. The cause of death was listed as metastatic lung cancer. He was buried in Woodland Cemetery in Kentwood, Louisiana.

At the time of his death, Shaw was engaged in a $5 million lawsuit against Garrison and members of an organization, Truth and Consequences Inc., that had financed Garrison&#x27;s investigation. As Shaw, a lifelong bachelor, had no heirs or surviving relatives, the United States Supreme Court dismissed the suit in 1978.

==Later disclosures==
In 1979, Richard Helms, former Director of the CIA, testified under oath that Shaw had been a part-time contact of the Domestic Contact Service (DCS) of the CIA, where Shaw volunteered information from his travels abroad, mostly to Latin America. He did so from 1948 till at least 1956. Like Shaw, 150,000 Americans (including businessmen and journalists) had provided such information to the DCS by the mid-1970s &quot;on a nonclandestine basis&quot;, and that &quot;such acts of cooperation should not be confused with an actual Agency relationship&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Tommy Lee Jones portrayed Shaw in Oliver Stone&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;JFK&quot;. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the role.

<text>Evan Ziporyn (b. Chicago, Illinois, December 14, 1959) is an American composer of post-minimalist music with a cross-cultural orientation, drawing equally from classical music, avant-garde, various world music traditions, and jazz. Ziporyn has composed for a wide range of ensembles, including symphony orchestras, wind ensembles, many types of chamber groups, and solo works, sometimes involving electronics. Balinese gamelan, for which he has composed numerous works, has compositions. He is known for his solo performances on clarinet and bass clarinet; additionally, Ziporyn plays gender wayang and other Balinese instruments, saxophones, piano &amp; keyboards, EWI, and Shona mbira.

Ziporyn is the Kenan Sahin Distinguished Professor of Music at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as well as director of MIT&#x27;s Center for Art, Science &amp; Technology (CAST). At MIT he directs Gamelan Galak Tika, an ensemble he founded in 1993, a group of 30 MIT students, staff and community members, devoted to the study and performance of new works for Balinese Gamelan.

He is currently a member of the Eviyan Trio, with Czech violinist/vocalist Iva Bittovà and American guitarist Gyan Riley.

He has released albums on Cantaloupe, New Albion, New World, Victo, Airplane Ears, and CRI Emergency Music; his works have also been recorded on Naxos, Koch, Innova, and World Village. As a performer, he has recorded for Nonesuch, Sony Classical, and Point Music, among others. He has composed music for a wide range of ensembles worldwide, including Yo-Yo Ma&#x27;s Silk Road Project, the American Composers Orchestra, the Boston Modern Orchestra Project, the Kronos Quartet, Brooklyn Rider, Ethel, cellist Maya Beiser, the Netherlands Wind Ensemble, the MIT Wind Ensemble, Gamelan Sekar Jaya, Sentieri Selvaggi, Gamelan Salukat, and Gamelan Semara Ratih.

Evan Ziporyn was named a 2007 USA Walker Fellow by United States Artists, an arts advocacy foundation dedicated to the support and promotion of America&#x27;s top living artists.

He was born in Chicago, Illinois and now lives in Lexington, Massachusetts with composer Christine Southworth. He is the brother of Brook Ziporyn and Terra Ziporyn Snider, and has two children, Leonardo Ziporyn and Ava Ziporyn.

== Career ==

Ziporyn studied at Eastman, Yale and UC Berkeley with Joseph Schwantner, Martin Bresnick, and Gerard Grisey. He first traveled to Bali in 1981, studying with Madé Lebah, Colin McPhee&#x27;s 1930s musical informant. He returned on a Fulbright in 1987. While living on the west coast during the 1980s he was a member of Gamelan Sekar Jaya. The three compositions he composed for Sekar Jaya all included western instruments.

He performed a clarinet solo at the First Bang on a Can Marathon in New York. His involvement with BOAC continued for 25 years: in 1992 he co-founded the Bang on a Can All-stars (Musical America&#x27;s 2005 Ensemble of the Year), with whom he toured the globe and premiered over 100 commissioned works, collaborating with Nik Bartsch, Iva Bittova, Don Byron, Ornette Coleman, Brian Eno, Philip Glass, Meredith Monk, Thurston Moore, Terry Riley and Tan Dun. He co-produced their seminal 1996 recording of Brian Eno&#x27;s Music for Airports, as well as their 2012 &quot;Big Beautiful Dark &amp; Scary&quot; (2012). He left the group in the fall of that year to form Eviyan with Iva Bittová and Gyan Riley, with whom he now concertizes and records regularly. In the fall of 2013 he founded the Critical Band, a group devoted to the music of the late British composer Steve Martland.

Ziporyn joined the MIT faculty in 1990, founding Gamelan Galak Tika there in 1993, and continued a series of compositions for gamelan and western instruments. These include three evening-length works, 2001&#x27;s &quot;ShadowBang&quot;, 2004&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; at the American Repertory Theater (Robert Woodruff, director), and 2009&#x27;s &quot;A House in Bali&quot;, an opera about composer Colin McPhee, anthropologist Margaret Mead, and artist Walter Spies, which joined Western singers Anne Harley, Marc Molomot and Timur Bekbosunov with Balinese traditional performers Nyoman Catra and Desak Made Suari Laksmi, and Bang on a Can All Stars with a full gamelan ensemble. It received its world premiere in Bali that summer and its New York premiere at BAM Next Wave in October 2010.

In 1992 Ziporyn founded the Bang on a Can All Stars, with whom he performed and recorded until 2012. He also was a member of Steve Reich and Musicians, with whom he shared a 1998 Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music Performance.

As a clarinetist, Ziporyn recorded the definitive version of Steve Reich&#x27;s multi-clarinet &quot;New York Counterpoint&quot; in 1996, sharing in that ensemble&#x27;s Grammy Award in 1998. In 2001 his solo clarinet CD, &quot;This is Not A Clarinet&quot;, made Top Ten lists across the country. His compositions have been commissioned by Yo-Yo Ma&#x27;s Silk Road Ensemble, Kronos Quartet, American Composers Orchestra, Maya Beiser, So Percussion, Wu Man, and the Boston Modern Orchestra Project, with whom he recorded two CDs, &quot;Frog&#x27;s Eye&quot; (2006) and &quot;Big Grenadilla/Mumbai&quot; (2012). His honors include awards from the Massachusetts Cultural Council (2011), The Herb Alpert Foundation (2011), USA Artists Walker Fellowship (2007), MIT&#x27;s Kepes Prize (2006), the American Academy of Arts and Letters Goddard Lieberson Fellowship (2004), as well as commissions from Meet the Composer/Commissioning Music USA and the Rockefeller MAP Fund. Recordings of his works have been released on Cantaloupe, Sony Classical, New Albion, New World, Koch, Naxos, Innova, and CRI.

He is Kenan Sahin Distinguished Professor of Music at MIT. He has also been inaugural director of MIT&#x27;s new Center for Art Science and Technology and still serves as head of Music and Theater Arts at the Center for Art, Science and Technology (CAST). He is also founder and artistic director of Gamelan Galak Tika, and curator of the MIT Sounding performance series.

<doc id="411259" wikidata="Q253446" url="?curid=411259" title="Anna Ancher">
<text>Anna Ancher (18 August 1859 – 15 April 1935) was a Danish artist associated with the Skagen Painters, an artist colony on the northern point of Jylland, Denmark. She is considered to be one of Denmark&#x27;s greatest visual artists.

==Background==

Anna Kirstine Brøndum was born in Skagen, Denmark, the daughter of Ane Hedvig Møller (1826–1916) and Erik Andersen Brøndum (1820–1890). She was the only one of the Skagen Painters who was born and grew up in Skagen, where her father owned the Brøndums Hotel. The artistic talent of Anna Ancher became obvious at an early age and she became acquainted with pictorial art via the many artists who settled to paint in Skagen, in the north of Jylland.

While she studied drawing for three years at the Vilhelm Kyhn College of Painting in Copenhagen, she developed her own style and was a pioneer in observing the interplay of different colors in natural light. She also studied drawing in Paris at the atelier of Pierre Puvis de Chavannes along with Marie Triepcke, who would marry Peder Severin Krøyer, another Skagen painter.

In 1880 she married fellow painter Michael Ancher, whom she met in Skagen. They had one child, daughter Helga Ancher. Despite pressure from society that married women should devote themselves to household duties, she continued painting after marriage.

==Career==
Anna Ancher was considered to be one of the great Danish pictorial artists by virtue of her abilities as a character painter and colorist. Her art found its expression in Nordic art&#x27;s modern breakthrough toward a more truthful depiction of reality, e.g. in &quot;Blue Ane&quot; (1882) and &quot;The Girl in the Kitchen&quot; (1883–1886).

=== Style ===
Ancher preferred to paint interiors and simple themes from the everyday lives of the Skagen people, especially fishermen, women, and children. She was intensely preoccupied with exploring light and color, as in &quot;Interior with Clematis&quot; (1913). She also created more complex compositions such as &quot;A Funeral&quot; (1891). Anna Ancher&#x27;s works often represented Danish art abroad. Ancher has been known for portraying similar civilians from the Skagen art colony in her works, including an old blind woman.

Anna Ancher has been praised for her painting entitled, &quot;Sørg&quot; (1902), which depicts a blonde long-haired, naked woman on one side of the work, a funerary cross in the middle, and an older pious woman draped in black clothing. The religious context of the painting could be related to Ancher&#x27;s own religious upbringing. Her portrayal of the female nude is unique for the time, given that this woman is not overtly sexualized and created solely as an object for the male gaze, as was typical among contemporary paintings of female nudes. Scholar Alice R. Price asserts that this painting is a reflection of Ancher&#x27;s position as a woman of faith living in the traditional bohemian lifestyle of artists, that Price interprets as indicative of an ongoing inner conflict for the artist.

=== Recognition ===
She exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. She was awarded the Ingenio et Arti medal in 1913, and the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat in 1924.

Ancher was included in the 2018 exhibit, &quot;Women in Paris 1850-1900&quot;.

==Residence==

The Skagen residence of Anna and Michael Ancher was purchased in 1884. In 1913, a large studio annex was added to the property. This also formed part of what is on display publicly today as a museum dedicated to both Anna and Michael Ancher. Upon her death in 1964, their daughter, Helga Ancher, left the house and all of its contents to a foundation. The former residence was restored and opened as a museum and visitor attraction.

In 1967, Michael and Anna Ancher&#x27;s house (&quot;Anchers Hus&quot;) in Skagen was converted into a museum by the Helga Ancher Foundation before &quot;Anchers Hus&quot; opened to the public for tours. The original furniture and paintings created by the Anchers and other Skagen artists are shown in the restored home and studio. Art exhibitions are arranged in the Saxild House (&quot;Saxilds Gaard&quot;), another building on the property. It is filled with displays of paintings by Michael and Anna Ancher, as well as by many other Skagen painters who made up their circle of friends.

==Correspondance==
A collection of almost 4,000 letters between Anna and Michael Ancher and their friends, with comments by the art historian Elisabeth Fabritius, was published as &quot;Anna og Mchael Ancher. Breve og fotografier 1866-1935&quot; I-VI was published by Forlaget Historika. in 2020.

==Danish thousand-kroner banknote==
Anna and Michael Ancher were featured on the front side of the DKK1000 banknote, which came into circulation on 25 November 2004 and subsequently, was replaced. The front of the banknote had a double portrait of Anna and Michael Ancher, derived from two 1884 paintings by Peder Severin Krøyer,
which originally hung on the walls in the dining room at Brøndums Hotel.

<text>Park furniture is furniture in a park. It is often made out of iron or wood.

Common examples of park furniture include bandstands, benches, chess tables, fountains, light fixtures, picnic tables, and statues. 

== Description ==
Researchers in Hong Kong wrote that park furniture is &quot;a type of artifact to support outdoor public recreational activities and green environment where users may act fairly as stated by British Standards Institute (2005)&quot;; this means that the furniture should be inclusive – &quot;accessible to, and usable by, as many people as reasonably possible ... without the need for special adaptation or specialised design&quot;.

== Construction ==
Around 1840, Janes, Beebe &amp; Co. produced one of the earliest products of mass-produced cast-iron seating in America, an example of which is held by the Smithsonian Institution as inv. no. 1980.006. The seat is an example of furniture that appeared in public parks in the mid 19th century. 

In some jurisdictions, furniture used in public parks is made by prison inmates as part of prison work programs.

<doc id="411263" wikidata="Q680743" url="?curid=411263" title="Balatonfüred">
<text>Balatonfüred (; ; ) is a resort town in Veszprém county, in Hungary. The town with a population of 13,000 is situated on the northern shore of Lake Balaton. It is considered to be the capital of the Northern lake shore and is a yachting destination. It is also a location for fishing (carp being the most common catch) although the introduction of eels and other non-indigenous species has caused ecological damage in recent years.

==Description==
The town has two marinas, a string of carbonated mineral water springs, listed buildings from the middle of the 18th and the 19th centuries and fine restaurants. It has modern hotels and guest-houses to accommodate about fifty thousand visitors in the summer. The nearest villages around Balatonfüred are Tihany, Aszófő, Balatonszőlős and Csopak, all renowned for their wine, land and beaches. Highway No 71 crosses the town as well as a single track railway line between Budapest and Tapolca. Although a shipyard was once the town&#x27;s largest employer, now that place has been taken by the State Hospital for Cardiology. The largest industry is catering and providing boarding and other accommodations. The town has a pier, a harbour, a large camping site and several private marinas.

Visitors come for the mild micro-climate, scenery, the local wine, made of Olaszrizling grapes, and sailing and swimming facilities, as well as to revive the two-century-old tradition of socializing around spas, bathing and vacationing. The main events of the two-month-long summer holiday season include a ball for first-time visitors with a beauty contest and a wine-tasting festival, both in August.

Füred (short for Balatonfüred) has six comprehensive schools, three grammar schools, a secondary modern school for viniculture, the Lajos Loczy High School and Janos Ferencsik Music School (conservatory). A number of choirs, bands and sporting clubs are also present. The town has a local TV studio and a monthly newspaper. Füred has a newly built conference and sport centre as well.
There are three churches in the town: a typical red-sandstone Catholic church, a white Protestant church and a modern Evangelist church. A Pentecostal, American type of Christian denomination Faith Church is also active in the former Communist party headquarters.

Balatonfüred has a number of conference halls and a large clinic for heart patients. It also has a number of wine cellars that sell white house wine from the vineyards on the hillside overlooking the town and the lake.

In winter, the lake may freeze over for weeks so that skaters and ice boaters take over near the shore of the town.

==State Hospital for Cardiology==
With its 429 beds the State Hospital for Cardiology in Balatonfüred boasts the largest cardiac-rehabilitation center in Hungary. The hospital is built on the lake shore and is flanked by the Tagore promenade, named after the Nobel-laureate Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore, who was treated here. Many other patients come here to heal and recuperate year-round thanks to the carbonated springs and baths, which are one of the best-known healing agents in Balatonfüred since the 17th century. The town was officially declared a spa in 1772. The Kossuth Spring and other springs near the hospital supply water containing free and bound carbon dioxide as well as iron, magnesium, potassium, hydrocarbonate, calcium, sodium, sulfur and other minerals. The temperature of the spring waters is they are collected into a large basin and conducted to the spa building. Then the carbonated water is warmed up to and used for treatment.

<text>Alcee Lamar Hastings ( ; September 5, 1936 – April 6, 2021) was an American politician and former judge from the state of Florida.

Hastings was nominated to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida by President Jimmy Carter in August 1979. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on October 31, 1979. In 1981, after an FBI sting operation, Hastings was charged with conspiracy to solicit a bribe. Following a 1983 criminal trial, Hastings was acquitted; however, he was impeached for bribery and perjury by the United States House of Representatives in 1988 and was convicted by the United States Senate in his impeachment trial on October 20, 1989. While Hastings was removed from the bench, the Senate did not bar him from holding public office in the future. Hastings was the first and, as of 2024, remains the only African American federal official to be impeached.

A Democrat, Hastings was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1992, serving until his death in 2021. His district, numbered as the 23rd district from 1993 to 2013 and the 20th district from 2013 until his death, included most of the majority-black precincts in and around Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. Following Ileana Ros-Lehtinen&#x27;s departure from office in 2019, Hastings became the dean of Florida&#x27;s congressional delegation; he retained this title until his death.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Alcee Lamar Hastings was born in Altamonte Springs, Florida, the son of Mildred L. (Merritt) and Julius &quot;J. C.&quot; Hastings. He was educated at Crooms Academy in Goldsboro (Sanford), Florida, before going on to attend Howard University in Washington, D.C., and Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in zoology and botany from Fisk in 1958. After being dismissed from Howard University School of Law, Hastings received his Juris Doctor from Florida A&amp;M University College of Law in 1963. While in school, he became a member of the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. He was admitted to the bar in 1963 and began to practice law.

Hastings participated in civil rights demonstrations and was jailed six times during such events. As a lawyer, Hastings filed suit after being denied a room at a hotel due to segregation policies.

===1970 U.S. Senate election===

Hastings decided to run for the United States Senate in 1970 after incumbent Spessard Holland decided to retire. He failed to win the Democratic primary or make the runoff election, finishing fourth out of five candidates, with 13% of the vote. Former Governor Farris Bryant finished first with 33% of the vote. State Senator Lawton Chiles was second with 26%. Chiles defeated Bryant in the runoff election and won the November general election.

==Judicial career (1977–1989)==

In 1977, Hastings became a judge of the circuit court of Broward County, Florida. On August 28, 1979, President Jimmy Carter nominated Hastings to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on October 31, 1979, and received his commission on November 2, 1979. Hastings was the first black federal judge in the history of the state of Florida. His service was terminated on October 20, 1989, due to impeachment and conviction.

===Allegations and impeachment===
====Criminal trial====
In 1981, after a sting operation by the FBI against attorney and alleged co-conspirator William Borders, Hastings was charged with conspiracy to solicit a $150,000 bribe () in exchange for a lenient sentence for Frank and Thomas Romano on 21 counts of racketeering and the return of their seized assets. In his 1983 trial, Hastings was acquitted by a jury after Borders refused to testify in court, despite having been convicted in his own trial in 1982. Borders went to jail for accepting the first $25,000 payment, but was later given a full pardon by President Bill Clinton on his last day in office.

====Impeachment trial====
The Judicial Conference of the United States investigated Hastings and brought its accusations, which it believed warranted an impeachment, to the United States House of Representatives. It concluded that Hastings had perjured himself and falsified evidence in order to obtain his acquittal, and that he had in fact conspired to gain financially by accepting bribes.

In 1988, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives took up the case, and Hastings was impeached for bribery and perjury by a vote of 413–3. He was then convicted in his impeachment trial before the United States Senate on October 20, 1989. At the time, the Senate was also controlled by a Democratic majority. Hastings became the sixth federal judge in the history of the United States to be removed from office by the Senate. The Senate, in two hours of roll calls, voted on 11 of the 17 articles of impeachment. It convicted Hastings of eight of the 11 articles. The vote on the first article was 69 for and 26 opposed. He was removed from the bench, but the Senate did not preclude him from holding office in the future. FBI examiner William Tobin later stated that some FBI testimony presented to Congress misrepresented or misstated forensic analysis he conducted, although he agreed with the overall FBI forensic assessment against Hastings. Tobin&#x27;s work centered on a purse strap and whether it was strong enough to be snapped accidentally, which related to an alibi Hastings had given for being with Borders. The FBI analysis, supported by Tobin, concluded that the strap had been deliberately cut, inferring that Hastings did so to concoct his alibi.

====Appeal====
Hastings filed suit in federal court claiming that his impeachment trial was invalid because he was tried by a Senate committee, not in front of the full Senate, and that he had been acquitted in a criminal trial. Judge Stanley Sporkin ruled in favor of Hastings, remanding the case to the Senate, but stayed his ruling pending the outcome of an appeal to the Supreme Court in a similar case regarding Judge Walter Nixon, who had also been impeached and removed.

The Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Nixon v. United States&quot;, again referring to Walter Nixon, that procedures for trying an impeached individual cannot be subject to review by the judiciary. Judge Sporkin changed his ruling accordingly, and Hastings&#x27;s conviction and removal were upheld.

==1990 Secretary of State election==
Hastings attempted to make a political comeback by running for Secretary of State of Florida, campaigning on a platform of legalizing casinos. In a three-way Democratic primary, he placed second with 33% of the vote, behind newspaper columnist Jim Minter&#x27;s 38% of the vote. In the runoff, which saw a large drop-off in turnout, Minter defeated Hastings, 67%–33%. Hastings won just one of Florida&#x27;s 67 counties, namely Dade County.

==U.S. House of Representatives (1993–2021)==
===Elections===
Hastings was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1992, representing Florida&#x27;s 23rd district. After placing second in the initial Democratic primary for the post, he scored an upset victory over state representative Lois J. Frankel in the runoff and went on to easily win the election in the heavily Democratic district. He did not face a serious challenge for reelection thereafter. Following redistricting, Hastings represented Florida&#x27;s 20th district from January 2013 until his death. His death triggered a special election in 2022.

===Tenure===
Hastings was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and was elected president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in July 2004. As a senior Democratic whip, Hastings was an influential member of the Democratic leadership. He was also a member of the House Rules Committee. He was previously a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI). On the HPSCI, Hastings was the chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.

====Impeachment matters====
In September 1998, Hastings introduced an unsuccessful resolution to impeach Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. On September 11, 1998, Hastings was one of 63 House members to vote against a resolution to publicly release the &quot;Starr Report&quot; into Democratic Party President Bill Clinton&#x27;s conduct and authorize a House Judiciary Committee review of the report. On October 8, 1998, Hastings joined all but 31 Democratic House members in voting against the authorization of the impeachment inquiry against Clinton. On December 9, 1998, Hastings joined nearly all Democrats in voting against all four articles of impeachment introduced against Clinton, two of which were successfully approved by the House. Also on December 19, 1998, Hastings joined nearly all Democrats in voting against the appointment of impeachment managers. On January 6, 1999, he joined nearly all Democrats in voting against the re-appointment of the impeachment managers at the start of the 106th United States Congress.

Hastings voted to impeach Texas federal judge Samuel B. Kent on all four counts presented against him on June 19, 2009.

On March 11, 2010, Hastings took part in the unanimous votes to approve all four articles of impeachment against Federal Judge Thomas Porteous.

On October 31, 2019, Hastings joined nearly all Democrats in voting for a resolution directing how several committee should proceed in the then-ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, a Republican. On December 18, 2019, he joined nearly all Democrats in voting to impeach Trump. On January 13, 2021, he joined all Democrats and ten Republicans in voting to impeach Trump for a second time.

====Objection to the 2000 presidential election====
Hastings and other members of the House of Representatives objected to counting the 25 electoral votes from Florida, which George W. Bush narrowly won after a contentious recount. Because no senator joined his objection, the objection was dismissed by Vice President Al Gore, who was Bush&#x27;s opponent in the 2000 presidential election.

====Objection to the 2004 presidential election====
Hastings was one of the 31 House Democrats who voted not to count the 20 electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election, despite Republican President George W. Bush winning the state by 118,457 votes. Without Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes, the election would have been decided by the U.S. House of Representatives, with each state having one vote per the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

====Bid for chairmanship of the House Intelligence Committee====
After the 2006 United States House of Representatives elections, Hastings attracted attention after it was reported that incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi might appoint him as head of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He had support from the Congressional Black Caucus but was opposed by the Blue Dog Coalition. Hastings attacked his critics as &quot;misinformed fools.&quot; Pelosi reportedly favored Hastings over the ranking Democrat, Jane Harman, due to policy differences and the Congressional Black Caucus&#x27;s support. On November 28, 2006, Pelosi announced that Hastings would not be the committee&#x27;s chairman, and she later chose Silvestre Reyes (D-TX). While Hastings was passed over to chair the committee, he became chair of a subcommittee. He told the &quot;National Journal&quot;, &quot;I am not angry. At some point along the way, it became too much to explain. That is legitimate politics. But it&#x27;s unfortunate for me.&quot;

====Comments about Sarah Palin====
On September 24, 2008, Hastings came under fire for comments he made about Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. Speaking in Washington, D.C., to a conference sponsored by the National Jewish Democratic Council, he said, &quot;If Sarah Palin isn&#x27;t enough of a reason for you to get over whatever your problem is with Barack Obama, then you damn well had better pay attention. Anybody toting guns and stripping moose don&#x27;t care too much about what they do with Jews and blacks. So, you just think this through.&quot;

On September 29, 2008, Hastings issued a written apology while standing by its core message: &quot;I regret the comments I made last Tuesday that were not smart and certainly not relevant to hunters or sportsmen. The point I made, and will continue to make, is that the policies and priorities of a McCain-Palin administration would be anathema to most African Americans and Jews. I regret that I was not clearer and apologize to Governor Palin, my host where I was speaking, and those who my comments may have offended.&quot;

====Lexus lease====
In May 2009, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Hastings spent over $24,000 in taxpayer money in 2008 to lease a luxury Lexus hybrid sedan. The &quot;Journal&quot; noted that the expenditure was legal, properly accounted for, and drawn from an expense allowance the U.S. government grants to all lawmakers.

====Sexual harassment allegation====
In June 2011, one of Hastings&#x27;s staff members, Winsome Packer, filed a lawsuit alleging that he had made repeated unwanted sexual advances and threatened her job when she refused him. A congressional ethics panel investigated these claims. Packer was represented by the conservative legal group Judicial Watch. Hastings denied the allegations and called them &quot;ludicrous.&quot; He said, &quot;I will win this lawsuit. That is a certainty. In a race with a lie, the truth always wins. And when the truth comes to light and the personal agendas of my accusers are exposed, I will be vindicated.&quot; In February 2012, it was reported that Hastings would be released from the lawsuit, and it would only continue against the Helsinki Commission which Hastings chaired and Packer represented in Vienna. In December 2017, it was reported that the Treasury Department paid $220,000 to settle the lawsuit. Hastings later complained that he played no role in the settlement negotiations but the way they had been framed implied that he had.

====Improper relationship investigation====
Hastings was investigated by the House Ethics Committee in 2019 over his relationship with then-girlfriend and Congressional deputy district director Patricia Williams. Williams, Hastings&#x27; girlfriend of over 25 years, was the highest-paid staffer in Hastings&#x27; office. For nearly a decade, she received greater compensation than her superior, Hastings&#x27; chief of staff, typically the highest-paid role in a Congressional office. Williams&#x27; compensation was at the maximum for Congressional staffers and exceeded that of every other deputy district director in Congress except one. The investigation sought to uncover whether the relationship violated a 2018 House nepotism rule against members engaging in sexual relationships with staffers.

The Ethics Committee dropped its investigation after saying that Hastings had married Williams in 2019, as the rule did not prohibit spousal relationships with staffers. However, it did not clarify why Hastings&#x27; alleged conduct prior to 2019, well after the rule was in place, was not subject to repercussions from the committee.

==Political positions==
===Foreign policy===
Hastings opposed President Donald Trump&#x27;s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital. He stated: &quot;I believe that Jerusalem is and should remain the undivided capital of Israel. To deny the Jewish connection to Jerusalem would be to deny world history. That being said, the manner in which the Trump Administration has announced its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is of great concern.&quot;

===Gun policy===
Hastings said that gun control is a &quot;critical element&quot; in addressing the United States&#x27; crime problem. He favored reinstating the Federal Assault Weapons Ban and supported a federal ban on bump stocks. He supported raising the minimum age to buy a rifle from 18 to 21. In 2017, he voted against the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017. His last rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund was an F, indicating that the organization believed that he did not support gun rights legislation.

Following the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Hastings released a statement in which he said, &quot;The stranglehold of the gun lobby has gone on long enough.&quot;
Hastings wrote a letter to the Speaker of the Florida House and President of the Florida Senate urging them to repeal the state&#x27;s preemption law, which prohibits communities in Florida from passing their own gun regulations.

==Personal life and death==
Hastings was married three times and had three children from his first two marriages, as well as one stepchild; his first two marriages ended in divorce. He married Patricia Williams in 2019, and they remained together until his death.

In January 2019, Hastings was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and he died from the disease on April 6, 2021, at the age of 84. After his death, his campaign account made a $23,000 expenditure to Williams with no listed campaign purpose.

<doc id="411266" wikidata="Q822146" url="?curid=411266" title="Lyricist">
<text>A lyricist is a writer who writes lyrics (the spoken words), as opposed to a composer, who writes the song&#x27;s music which may include but not limited to the melody, harmony, arrangement and accompaniment.

==Royalties==
A lyricist&#x27;s income derives from royalties received from original songs. Royalties may range from 50 percent of the song, if it was written primarily with the composer, or less if they wrote the song in collaboration. Songs are automatically copyrighted as soon as they are in tangible forms, such as a recording or sheet music. However, before a song is published or made public, its author or publisher should register it with the Copyright Office at the United States Library of Congress to better protect against copyright infringement.

==Collaborations==

Songwriting collaborations can take different forms. Some composers and lyricists work closely together on a song, with each having an input into both words and tune. Usually a lyricist fills in the words to a tune already fully written out. Dorothy Fields worked in this way. Lyricists have often added words to an established tune, as Johnny Burke did with the Erroll Garner jazz standard &quot;Misty&quot;. Some partnerships work almost totally independently, for example, Bernie Taupin would write lyrics and hand them over to Elton John, who composed the music to go with it, with minimum interaction between the two writers.

The collaboration of John Lennon and Paul McCartney is widely considered the most successful songwriting partnership in history, with their songs making up the majority of The Beatles&#x27; catalog. Other famous collaborations include Leiber and Stoller, the Rolling Stones lead singer Mick Jagger with Keith Richards, and Richard Carpenter with John Bettis.

==Religious songwriting==

In the Christian hymn-singing tradition, many of the popular pieces have words written to fit existing melodies. The Christmas carol &quot;What Child Is This?&quot; had its words set to an old English folk tune that had been a lover&#x27;s lament, &quot;Greensleeves&quot;. The English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams set existing poems, such as those by William Cowper and Charles Wesley, to traditional folk tunes to create hymns, many of which he published in &quot;The English Hymnal&quot;. A different way this happened was the combination of unrelated words and tune, such as &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, the national anthem of the United States, with words written by Francis Scott Key strictly as a poem, later set to the tune of an old drinking song.

==Classical music ==

In opera, the librettist is responsible for all text, whether spoken or sung in recitative or aria.

<text>Mario Rafael Díaz-Balart y Caballero ( ; born September 25, 1961) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for Florida&#x27;s 26th congressional district. A member of the Republican Party, he was elected in 2002, and his district includes much of northwestern Miami-Dade County, including Hialeah, and much of the northern portion of the Everglades.

After Representative Alcee Hastings&#x27;s death in April 2021, Díaz-Balart became the dean (or longest-serving member) of Florida&#x27;s congressional delegation.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Díaz-Balart was born in 1961 in Fort Lauderdale, to Cuban parents, the late Cuban politician Rafael Díaz-Balart, and his wife, Hilda Caballero Brunet.

He is a member of the Díaz-Balart family: His aunt, Mirta Díaz-Balart, was the first wife of Cuban president Fidel Castro. Her son, and his cousin, was Fidel Ángel &quot;Fidelito&quot; Castro Díaz-Balart. His uncle is the Cuban-Spanish painter Waldo Díaz-Balart. His brother Lincoln Díaz-Balart represented Florida&#x27;s 21st District from 1993 to 2011. He has two other brothers, José Díaz-Balart, a journalist, and Rafael Díaz-Balart, a banker.

He studied political science at the University of South Florida before beginning his public service career as an aide to then-Miami Mayor Xavier Suárez in 1985. In the same year, he changed his political party affiliation from Democratic to Republican.

==Florida legislature==
Díaz-Balart was elected to the Florida House in 1988 and to the Florida Senate in 1992. He returned to the Florida House in 2000.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
;2002–2006
Díaz-Balart gave up his seat in the state house to run in the newly created 25th District, which included most of western Miami-Dade County, part of Collier County and the mainland portion of Monroe County. He won with 64% of the vote. He was unopposed for reelection in 2004, and won a third term with 58% of the vote in 2006.

;2008

In 2008, Díaz-Balart faced his strongest challenge to date in Joe García, former executive director of the Cuban American National Foundation and former chairman of the Miami-Dade County Democratic Party. Díaz-Balart defeated Garcia with 53% of the vote.
;2010

On February 11, 2010, Díaz-Balart announced his intention to seek election in Florida&#x27;s 21st congressional district—being vacated by his brother, Lincoln Díaz-Balart—rather than the 25th district. Unlike the 25th, the 21st has long been considered the Miami area&#x27;s most Republican district. No other party even fielded a candidate when filing closed on April 30, handing Díaz-Balart the seat.

;2012

Díaz-Balart was reelected unopposed in 2012 in the renumbered 25th district.

;2014
In 2014, Díaz-Balart ran unopposed.

;2016
In 2016, Díaz-Balart beat Democrat Alina Valdes, 62.4% to 37.6%. It was only the third time that a Democrat had filed to run in this district, which had been numbered as the 21st from 1993 to 2013.

;2018
The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; reported in April 2018 that Díaz-Balart seemed a shoo-in for reelection in November. Former Hialeah mayor Raúl Martínez, a Democrat who had challenged Lincoln Díaz-Balart in what was the 21st in 2008, said the 25th district &quot;is very hard to win for a Democrat, especially if you&#x27;re not Hispanic and you don&#x27;t speak Spanish.&quot; Valdes, who had lost to him in 2016, was a candidate in the Democratic primary. In April, Annisa Karim, who is active in the Democratic Party, announced that she too would run in the primary. In May, the &quot;Herald&quot; reported that Mary Barzee Flores, a former judge who had at first decided to run in the 27th district, had opted instead to run for Díaz-Balart&#x27;s seat.

In the November 2018 general election, Díaz-Balart defeated Barzee Flores, 60.5% to 39.5%.

===Committee assignments===
For the 118th Congress:
* Committee on Appropriations
** Subcommittee on Defense
** Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (Chair)
** Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies

===Caucus memberships===
* Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Conference
* Founder of the Protecting Families Online Initiative
* Founding member of the Washington Waste Watchers
* Member of the Congressional Cuba Democracy Caucus
* Republican Main Street Partnership
* House Baltic Caucus
*Republican Governance Group

==Political positions==
As of January 2018, Díaz-Balart had voted with his party in 92.4% of votes in the 115th United States Congress and voted in line with President Trump&#x27;s position in 93.1% of votes.

He is a founding member of the Congressional Hispanic Conference, a caucus of Hispanic Republican congressmen.

=== LGBT rights ===
In May 2019, Díaz-Balart voted to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing, public accommodations, public education, federal funding, credit, and the jury system under the Equality Act. He joined seven other Republicans and 228 Democrats in supporting the legislation, which passed the United States House of Representatives during the 116th Congress.

In February 2021, Díaz-Balart changed his position on the legislation, voting against it during the 117th Congress on the basis that it did not protect individuals or organizations who oppose LGBTQ rights. In a statement released after his vote, he claimed Democrats ignored Republicans&#x27; issues with the bill and &quot;doubled down on some of the most troubling issues, including sabotaging religious freedom.&quot;

In 2021, Díaz-Balart co-sponsored the Fairness for All Act, the Republican alternative to the Equality Act. The bill would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity, and protect the free exercise of religion.

In 2015, Díaz-Balart was one of 60 Republicans voting to uphold President Barack Obama&#x27;s 2014 executive order banning federal contractors from making hiring decisions that discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

In 2016, Díaz-Balart was one of 43 Republicans to vote for the Maloney Amendment to H.R. 5055 which would prohibit the use of funds for government contractors who discriminate against LGBT employees.

On July 19, 2022, Díaz-Balart and 46 other Republican Representatives voted for the Respect for Marriage Act, which would codify the right to same-sex marriage in federal law. However, Díaz-Balart voted against final passage on December 8, 2022.

===Vote Smart issue positions===
According to Vote Smart&#x27;s 2016 analysis, Díaz-Balart generally supports pro-life legislation, opposes an income tax increase, opposes mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, opposes federal spending as a means of promoting economic growth, supports lowering taxes as a means of promoting economic growth, opposes requiring states to adopt federal education standards, supports building the Keystone Pipeline, supports government funding for the development of renewable energy, opposes the federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, opposes gun-control legislation, supports repealing the Affordable Care Act, opposes requiring immigrants who are unlawfully present to return to their country of origin before they are eligible for citizenship, opposes same-sex marriage, and supports allowing individuals to divert a portion of their Social Security taxes into personal retirement accounts.

=== Environment ===
In 2007, Díaz-Balart said, &quot;I know there&#x27;s a lot of money to be made on the bandwagon of global warming. You can make movies, documentaries, get a lot of research money — and that&#x27;s okay, I love capitalism...My fear is using the bandwagon of global warming to have Congress act on some knee-jerk reaction which will please some editorialists, will hurt our economy, will not do anything to help us in the future.&quot;

As of January 2018, Díaz-Balart was not a member of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus.

=== Health care ===
On May 4, 2017, Díaz-Balart voted to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and pass the American Health Care Act.

===Donald Trump===
In February 2017, Díaz-Balart voted against a resolution that would have directed the House to request 10 years of then-President Donald Trump&#x27;s tax returns, which would then have been reviewed by the House Ways and Means Committee in a closed session.

Díaz-Balart supported Trump&#x27;s firing of FBI Director James Comey, saying, &quot;It is clear that Director Comey had lost the confidence of the deputy attorney general, attorney general, and the president. Unfortunately, he became a controversial and divisive figure.&quot;

In January 2018, after it was reported that Trump had voiced his opposition to immigration from Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries—which he reportedly called &quot;shithole countries&quot;—in a meeting on immigration reform, Díaz-Balart, who attended the meeting, did not say whether the alleged incident took place.

In December 2020, Díaz-Balart was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of &quot;election subversion&quot;. She also reprimanded Díaz-Balart and the other House members who supported the lawsuit: &quot;The 126 Republican Members that signed onto this lawsuit brought dishonor to the House. Instead of upholding their oath to support and defend the Constitution, they chose to subvert the Constitution and undermine public trust in our sacred democratic institutions.&quot; New Jersey Representative Bill Pascrell, citing section three of the 14th Amendment, called for Pelosi to not seat Díaz-Balart and the other Republicans who signed the brief supporting the suit, arguing that &quot;the text of the 14th Amendment expressly forbids Members of Congress from engaging in rebellion against the United States. Trying to overturn a democratic election and install a dictator seems like a pretty clear example of that.&quot; On January 6, 2021, Diaz-Balart was among a group of legislators who voted against certification of the United States Electoral College vote count despite no evidence of widespread voter fraud.

===Committee membership===
On February 4, 2021, Díaz-Balart voted with 10 other Republican House members and all voting Democrats to strip Marjorie Taylor Greene of her House Education and Labor Committee and House Budget Committee assignments in response to controversial political statements she had made.

===Economic issues===
On September 29, 2008, Díaz-Balart voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which was intended to purchase distressed assets and supply cash directly to banks during the global financial crisis of 2008.

Díaz-Balart voted to promote free trade with Peru, against assisting workers who lose jobs due to globalization, for the Central America Free Trade Agreement, for the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement, for the US-Singapore free trade agreement, and for free trade with Chile. He was rated 75% by the National Foreign Trade Council, indicating support for trade engagement.

====Tax reform====
Díaz-Balart voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The Center for American Progress, a center-left think-tank, estimated that 41,000 of his constituents would lose their health insurance as a result of the bill&#x27;s passing.

===Foreign policy===
Díaz-Balart has strongly supported the right of self-determination on the Falkland Islands, over which there is a sovereignty dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom. On April 18, 2013, he introduced a House resolution calling on the federal government to officially recognize the result of the 2013 Falkland Islands sovereignty referendum in which the Falkland Islanders overwhelmingly voted to remain a British Overseas Territory. Díaz-Balart introduced a similar resolution in 2017, recognizing the result of that year&#x27;s general election in the Falklands.

He was among the 218 Republican representatives who voted for a resolution providing support for Israel following the October 7, 2023 attacks.

====Cuba====
In 2007, Díaz-Balart advocated maintaining the Cuban embargo, saying, &quot;Some people do not understand the embargo of Cuba. Its purpose is to keep American hard currency out of the hands of a Communist thug by restricting most trade and travel.&quot;

In an April 2015 essay for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Díaz-Balart wrote that President Obama &quot;continues to appease brutal dictatorships while gaining precious little in return. He conflates the Cuban dictatorship with the Cuban people when in reality, their interests are diametrically opposed.&quot; Díaz-Balart noted that &quot;all eight Cuban-American senators and congressmen from both sides of the aisle strongly disagree&quot; with Obama&#x27;s policy on Cuba, whose people &quot;want to gather peacefully, speak their minds, practice their faiths, access the Internet, and enjoy the fruits of their labor.&quot;

In September 2016, Díaz-Balart praised Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump &quot;for firmly stating his commitment today to reverse President Obama&#x27;s capitulations to the Castro regime&quot; and contrasted Trump&#x27;s position to what he called Hillary Clinton&#x27;s &quot;foolhardy stance&quot;. The U.S., he said, needs &quot;a president who once again will stand with the Cuban people instead of emboldening and enriching their oppressors.&quot;

In a March 2017 memo to the Trump White House, Díaz-Balart argued that if the Cuban government did not conform to the Helms-Burton law within 90 days, the U.S. should revert to its pre-Obama policy on Cuba.

On January 19, 2023, Diaz-Balart said he supported sanctioning and revoking the visas of members of the Honduran government if the legislative body voted to remove Honduras from CAFTA. He was the first U.S. lawmaker to threaten to revoke the visas of members of Xiomara Castro&#x27;s government.

=== Immigration and refugees ===
In 2014, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Díaz-Balart was &quot;eagerly seeking a deal&quot; on undocumented immigrants &quot;that can somehow please enough Republicans and Democrats to advance. And that upsets many Democrats and Republicans.&quot; After being &quot;involved in bipartisan talks on the issue for years&quot;, he was &quot;one of the guys most skilled on the issue&quot; and hence &quot;gets plenty of flack from both sides.&quot; Díaz-Balart told the &quot;Post&quot; that &quot;President Obama said that this was going to be one of his first priorities in his first 12 months&quot;, but even when &quot;Democrats controlled everything&quot;, nothing got done &quot;because they didn&#x27;t want to do it.&quot;

Díaz-Balart supported Trump&#x27;s 2017 executive order to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, saying, &quot;The ban is only temporary until the administration can review and enact the necessary procedures to vet immigrants from these countries. The ban is based on countries the Obama administration identified as &#x27;countries of concern&#x27; and not based on a religious test.&quot;

He took part in a January 2018 White House meeting about DACA, and said that nothing would &quot;divert my focus to stop the deportation of these innocent people whose futures are at stake.&quot;

=== Gun policy ===
In the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting on February 14, 2018, in Parkland, Florida, Díaz-Balart said gun control legislation would not be effective at stopping mass shootings, saying, &quot;I want to make sure we look at things that could make a difference.&quot;

===Drug policy===
Díaz-Balart has a &quot;D&quot; rating from NORML for his voting history regarding cannabis-related causes.

===Espionage===
Díaz-Balart took part in a November 2013 meeting between American legislators and the European Parliament&#x27;s foreign affairs committee about NSA spying on European officials. He told his European counterparts that they should realize that the U.S. is their greatest ally. &quot;Part of re-establishing trust&quot;, he said, &quot;is to know who your friends are and treat them accordingly, and to know who your enemies are and treat them accordingly.&quot;

===Infrastructure===
A 2017 report found that Díaz-Balart had delivered millions to his district for road and highway improvements.

==Personal life==
Díaz-Balart lives in Miami with his wife, Tia, and their son, Cristian Rafael.

On March 18, 2020, Díaz-Balart announced he had tested positive for COVID-19. He was the first member of Congress to do so. While recovering from the effects of the disease, though still drained from the experience, Diaz-Balart said he would offer his blood plasma, with antibodies against the virus, for experimental treatment or research purposes.

Díaz-Balart is Roman Catholic.

<doc id="411278" wikidata="Q68978" url="?curid=411278" title="Thun">
<text>Thun () is a town and a municipality in the administrative district of Thun in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. It is located where the Aare flows out of Lake Thun (Thunersee), southeast of Bern.

 the municipality has almost about 45,000 inhabitants and around 80,000 live in the agglomeration.

Besides tourism, machine and precision instrument engineering, the largest garrison in the country, the food industry, armaments and publishing are of economic importance to Thun.

The official language of Thun is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect.

== History ==

The area of what is now Thun was inhabited since the Neolithic age (mid-3rd millennium BC). During the early Bronze Age there were a number of settlements along the lake shore and the Aare. A site at Renzenbühl had a local chief or nobleman&#x27;s grave which contained one of the richest collections of early Bronze Age artifacts in Europe. The Thun-Renzenbühl axe, dating from 1800 BC, is one of the earliest examples of damascening technique in the world. The gold inlay decoration on the axe may also have a numerical, astronomical meaning. Another site at Wiler contained approximately 1,500 maritime snail shells which were harvested from the Mediterranean and traded over the Alps.

The name of the town derives from the Celtic term &quot;Dunum&quot;, meaning &quot;fortified town&quot;. It fell to Rome in 58 BC, when Roman legions conquered almost all of Switzerland, and it soon became one of the main centers of Roman administration in the region.

The Romans were driven out of Thun, and out of the rest of Switzerland, by the Burgundians around 400 AD. The Aare became the frontier between the Christian Burgundians and the Pagan, German-speaking Alemanni, who lived north. The region was mentioned for the first time during the 7th century, in the chronicle of Frankish monk Fredgar. The town is first mentioned in 1133 as &quot;Tuno&quot;.

The region of Thun became a part of the Holy Roman Empire in 1033, when Conrad II gained the title of King of Burgundy. The emperors entrusted the Zähringen family, centred in Bern, with subduing the unruly nobles of central Switzerland. Around 1190 Duke Bertold V of Zähringen, built Thun castle and expanded the town. After Bertold&#x27;s death in 1218, his territories went to Ulrich III von Kyburg.

In 1264 Thun received town rights and in 1384 the town was bought by the canton of Bern. Thun was the capital of the Canton of Oberland of the Helvetic Republic, which lasted from 1798 until 1803.

In 1819 a Military School was founded in the town, which later developed into the main military school in Switzerland. Thun was connected to the railway network of Switzerland in 1859 and telephone access made available in 1888.

<text>Guînes (; ; ) is a commune in the northern French department of Pas-de-Calais. Historically, it was spelt &quot;Guisnes&quot;.

On 7 January 1785, Jean-Pierre Blanchard, a French pioneer in hydrogen-balloon flight, completed the first aerial crossing of the English Channel, landing in the woods south of Guînes, where a memorial column stands today.

==Geography==
Guînes is located on the border of the two territories of the Boulonnais and Calaisis, at the edge of the now-drained marshes, which extend from there to the coast. The Guînes canal connects with Calais.

==History==

Historically, Guînes was the capital of a small county of the same name.

After the Romans left, in the 5th century, there is little known about the town. In the Dark Ages, according to legend, the territory of Guînes became the property of one Aigneric, Mayor of the Palace of the Burgundian king Théodebert II.

In 928, when the Danes invaded and seized the place, it was probably a defenceless village. A fenced mound and a double ditch would soon have been created by the Danes. This is the origin of the castle of Guînes. Arnulf I, Count of Flanders, realizing a counter-attack would be costly, arranged the marriage of his daughter Elstrude, to Sigfrid, the Danish leader, bestowing upon him the title of Count of Guînes but as vassal to him, the Count of Flanders. Under Sigfrid&#x27;s successors, the county of Guînes acquired considerable importance.

At the beginning of the 11th century, Count Manassès founded a convent of the order of St Benedict. This was placed under the jurisdiction of the nearby abbey of Saint Léonard. At that time, Guînes comprised three parishes within its walls, whose churches were dedicated to Saint Bertin, Saint Pierre and Saint Médard. Outside the town ramparts were the abbey of Saint Léonard, the church of Saint-Blaise, in the hamlet of Melleke, and the leper-house of Saint Quentin, in the hamlet of Spelleke in Tournepuits.

At the end of the 11th century, Baldwin I, Count of Guînes, built a huge stone castle on top of Sigfrid&#x27;s old keep and enclosed the town within a stone wall, with defensive towers at each of the entrances. His brother Fulk was a participant in the First Crusade. In 1180, Guînes was passed together with Ardres, Arras and Saint-Omer to the French crown as part of the dowry of Isabel of Hainaut when she married Philip II of France.

On 22 January 1351, three years after the capture of Calais by Edward III, the castle of Guînes was delivered up to the English. In 1360, the Treaty of Brétigny surrendered the city and its county to England and they eventually became part of the Pale of Calais, the last English possession in mainland France. The &quot;Field of the Cloth of Gold&quot;, where Henry VIII of England and Francis I of France met in 1520, was at Balinghem in the immediate neighbourhood.

When the French captured the port of Calais in January 1558, Guînes held out, by the courageous efforts of the English commander, William Grey, 13th Baron Grey de Wilton. After a few days of desperate fighting, however, Grey was wounded and his soldiers refused to fight on. The French gave honourable terms of surrender and English rule of the area came to an end.

==Population==
The inhabitants are called &quot;Guinois&quot;.
==Places and monuments==

===Blanchard&#x27;s Column===

On 25 May 1785 a column was erected to commemorate Jean-Pierre Blanchard&#x27;s crossing of the English Channel by hydrogen balloon on 7 January 1785. (). The inscription reads as follows, here translated into English:

==Transport==
The Chemin de fer d&#x27;Anvin à Calais opened a railway station at Guînes in 1881. The railway was closed in 1955.

<text>Harnes () is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Hauts-de-France region of France.

==Geography==
Harnes is an ex-coalmining and light industrial town situated some northeast of Lens, at the junction of the D162e and the D39. The Lens canal forms much of the southern border of the town and the A21 autoroute passes by a few yards from the canal.

==History==
First recorded as Hamas, the town was known as Harnis until, in the 12th century, when its present spelling was used. It’s possible that the name comes from the Flemish &quot;Hearn&quot; meaning “Marsh”.

The town was settled during the Gallo-Roman period, as archaeological finds have proved. In the municipal museum of Harnes, one can see the &quot;treasure of Harnes&quot;: Coins, building materials, urns, vases, spears, iron objects and bones as well as some Samian ware (red glazed pottery) decorated with eagles, lions, sphinxes etc.

In 1304, Harnes was looted and burned by the Flemish. Under the Counts of Burgundy, from 1384 to 1482, civil and foreign wars were waged. Fighting, famine, plague and epidemics badly affected the people and prosperity of the region.

In 1438, Harnes was recorded with &quot;31 fires (homes) and 109 inhabitants&quot;. The village was so poor that it was exempted from paying taxes.

In 1493, during the reign of Philip the Fair, the Austrians attacked France. They made camp at Harnes and then destroyed the castle.

On 2 November 1789 the National Assembly voted through the law of nationalization of all religious property. The people of Harnes were able to buy all the land that once belonged to the monastery, part of the abbey of St. Pierre at Ghent.

==Population==
==Eco water treatment system==
In the old riverbed of the Deûle/Souchez river (long-since drained by the creation of the Lens canal) and on the former mining area, the local authorities have created a landscape whose objective is to supplement the wastewater treatment leaving the sewage treatment plant at Fouquières by biological methods to eliminate pathogens and phosphates.
Five successive treatments are employed, involving filtration by coppiced willow, tanks planted with reeds, iris, bulrush etc., oxygenation and exposure to sunlight. The energy needed for pumping the water provided by four wind turbines. It takes about one month for the impure water to pass through the cleaning course, before joining the Lens canal.

This project, which took five years to build (1999–2004), was awarded the “Rosa Barba” at the fourth biennial European landscape congress in Barcelona.

<text>Câmpulung (also spelled &quot;Cîmpulung&quot;, , , Old Romanian &quot;Dlăgopole&quot;, &quot;Длъгополе&quot; (from Middle Bulgarian), or &quot;Câmpulung Muscel&quot;) is a city in Argeș County, Muntenia, Romania. It is situated among the outlying hills of the Southern Carpathians, at the head of a long well-wooded glen traversed by the river Târgului, a tributary of the river Argeș.

== History ==

Near Câmpulung are the remains of Jidava (or Jidova) Roman fort built around 190–211 AD on the frontier of the empire, the Limes Transalutanus; and just next to it, vestiges of a Roman colony, variously identified with Romula, Stepenium and Ulpia Traiana. Now called &quot;Grădiștea&quot; (meaning &quot;place of a fortress&quot; in Romanian) or &quot;Jidovi&quot;.

Campulung was also important because it was only 37 km away from the Bran Pass an important trade and military route for militaries and merchants.

=== Middle Ages ===

Câmpulung was the first capital of the feudal state of Wallachia which might mean that the city might have been built in the 13th century, until succeeded by Curtea de Argeș in the 14th century. There was a considerable traffic with Transylvania, over the Rucăr–Bran Pass, to the north, and with the south by a branch railway to Ploiești.

Câmpulung was one of the earliest urban settlements in Wallachia, the Transylvanian Saxon colonists contributing to its development by bringing the German urban culture. The earliest written evidence of the town&#x27;s existence is dated 1300, and is to be found in the Câmpulung church. The inscription is an epitaph of &quot;Laurencius de Longo Campo&quot;, the full text being &quot;Hic sepultus est comes Laurencius de Longo-Campo, pie memorie, Anno Domini MCCC&quot; (&quot;Here is buried count Laurentius of Longus-Campus, in pious memory, Anno Domini 1300&quot;). Laurentius was most likely the person coordinating the colonization process.

The oldest known written document in Old Romanian was dated back to 1521 (Neacșu&#x27;s letter). The letter was written to warn the city of Brasov of an impending Ottoman attack. The letter also names the city in Old Romanian, which was Slavic, according to its roots: &quot;Dlăgopole&quot; — &quot;Длъгополь&quot; (with the same meaning — &quot;a long field&quot;).

=== Early Modern Ages ===
When the printing press started to get popular in Europe, Matei Basarab managed to bring a printing press in Campulung in 1635 where Orthodox books would be printed and would be sent all over the Balkan peninsula for Orthodox people. This did not last long and in 1650 there weren&#x27;t records of books being printed after that.

During the reign of Șerban Cantacuzino (1678–1688), pressure was exerted to change the Catholic judges of Câmpulung to Eastern Orthodox.

Originally, the Romanians of the town did not have the same rights as the German colonists, but by the 15th century, the two communities were already merged, as shown by the new Romanian churches built near the Catholic areas and by the fact that some of the elected &quot;județs&quot; were Romanians. Another community in the town were the Bogomil Bulgarians, who settled in the &quot;Șchei&quot; neighbourhood (&quot;Șchei&quot; being an old Romanian word referring to Slavic people). Outside the town, in the south-west, on the hill currently named &quot;Câmpul mișeilor&quot; (&quot;Field of the cripple&quot;) was a leper colony, which had its own church and mill.

Câmpulung was the first capital of the feudal state of Wallachia which might mean that the city might have been built in the 13th century, until succeeded by Curtea de Argeș in the 14th century. There was a considerable traffic with Transylvania, over the Bran Pass, 24 kilometers to the north, and with the south by a branch railway to Ploiești.

=== Modern Era ===
From the Middle Ages until 1822 Câmpulung had its own autonomy, until it was withdrawn in 1822.

At the end of the 19th century Câmpulung had a population of 11,244 people, and the main streets were called Negru Vodă, Râului, Matei Basarab, and Gruiului, running parallel to the city centre and paved with cobblestones, some of them planted with trees. There were three squares Sfântul Ilie, Scheiul și a Județelor Sfântul Ilie square was the main one. And next to the church of Sfântul Ilie there was a weekly fair there, as well as a big annual fair between 17 and 28 July.

In 1950 Muscel County was abolished and Câmpulung became a district town, the residence of the Muscel raion of the Argeș Region. In 1968, during the administrative reform, the city lost its status of regional administrative center, becoming a city of Argeș County. Soon after, Câmpulung was declared a municipality in 1994.

<text>Hénin-Beaumont (; ) is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Hauts-de-France region of Franc about east of Lens.

==History==
The commune came into existence in 1970, the result of a merger of the communes of Hénin-Liétard and Beaumont.

During World War I on the night of 3-4 October 1914, the Germans blew up the church of Saint-Martin, which was rebuilt in Greco-Byzantine style in 1932.

In Second World War Hénin-Beaumont was liberated by the Allies, in September 1944.

==Politics==
In the 2009 election to replace the incumbent Socialist mayor who had resigned after a corruption scandal, the National Front took first place in the first round with 39% of the vote. A left-wing list was second with 20% of the vote. This led all other parties including the center-right Union for a Popular Movement to support the list led by the independent left-wing candidate, Daniel Duquenne in the second round runoff. Duquenne won the race 52%-48%.

In the first round of the 2012 presidential election, Marine Le Pen won in Hénin-Beaumont, with 35% of the vote, ahead of François Hollande (27%) and Nicolas Sarkozy (16%).

In 2014, the far right Front National won control of the city outright. FN politician Steeve Briois was elected mayor with 50.3 percent of the vote.

The town has been noted for its political control swinging from socialist to far-right.

<doc id="411291" wikidata="Q157964" url="?curid=411291" title="Sorbus">
<text>Sorbus is a genus of over 100 species of trees and shrubs in the rose family, Rosaceae. Species of &quot;Sorbus&quot; (&quot;s.str.&quot;) are commonly known as rowan or mountain-ash. The genus used to include species commonly known as whitebeam, chequer tree and service tree that are now classified in other genera (see below). The genus &quot;Sorbus&quot;, as currently circumscribed, includes only the pinnate leaved species of former subgenus &quot;Sorbus&quot;.

&quot;Sorbus&quot; is not closely related to the true ash trees which belong to the genus &quot;Fraxinus&quot;, although the leaves are superficially similar.

==Genus==
As treated in its broad sense, the genus was traditionally divided into several subgenera, however, this treatment was found to be paraphyletic, comprising two disparate lineages within the Malinae subtribe. Consequently, each of the former subgenera have since been elevated into genera in their own right, with the genus name &quot;Sorbus&quot; retained only for the rowans. Additionally, it was recognised that despite a comparably large genetic distance between them, the genera &quot;Sorbus (&quot;sensu stricto), &quot;Aria, Chamaemespilus&quot; and &quot;Torminalis&quot; have interbred extensively, in various combinations, which lead to the recognition of an additional five intergeneric hybrid genera.

;&quot;Sorbus&quot; (&quot;Sorbus&quot;)
* now genus &quot;Sorbus&quot; s.s., are commonly known as the rowan (primarily in the UK) or mountain-ash (in Ireland, North America and the UK), with compound leaves usually hairless or thinly hairy below; fruit carpels not fused; the type is &quot;Sorbus aucuparia&quot; (European rowan). Distribution: cool-temperate Northern Hemisphere.
;&quot;Sorbus&quot; (&quot;Aria&quot;)
* now genus &quot;Aria&quot; and its intergeneric hybrids (see below), the whitebeams, with simple leaves usually strongly white-hairy below (hence the name, from German &quot;Weissbaum&quot;, &#x27;white tree&#x27;); fruit carpels not fused; the type is &quot;Aria edulis&quot; (common whitebeam). Distribution: Europe, Maghreb and western Asia.
;&quot;Sorbus&quot; (&quot;Micromeles&quot;)
* now genus &quot;Micromeles&quot;, a group of east Asian species with narrow leaves; sometimes previously included in subgenus &quot;Aria&quot;. Distribution: temperate and tropical east Asia.
;&quot;Sorbus&quot; (&quot;Cormus&quot;)
* now genus &quot;Cormus&quot;, with compound leaves similar to subgenus &quot;Sorbus&quot;, but with distinct fused carpels in the fruit; just one species, &quot;Cormus domestica&quot; (true service tree). Distribution: North Africa, warm-temperate Europe, western Asia. Used to flavour some apple wines, see &quot;Apfelwein&quot;.
;&quot;Sorbus&quot; (&quot;Torminaria&quot;)
* now genus &quot;Torminalis&quot;, with rather maple-like lobed leaves with &quot;pointed&quot; lobes; fruit carpels not fused; just one species (wild service tree). Distribution: warm-temperate Europe, south to the mountains of North Africa and east to the Caucasus and Lebanon ranges.
;&quot;Sorbus&quot; (&quot;Chamaemespilus&quot;)
* now genus &quot;Chamaemespilus&quot;, monotypic, with a single shrubby species, false medlar. Has simple, glabrous leaves and pink flowers with erect sepals and petals. Distribution: mountains of southern Europe.
Intergeneric hybrid genera

* &quot;Hedlundia - Aria × Sorbus&quot; hybrids
* &quot;Karpatiosorbus&quot; - &quot;Aria&quot; × &quot;Torminalis&quot; hybrids
* &quot;Majovskya&quot; - &quot;Aria&quot; × &quot;Chamaemespilus&quot; hybrids
* &quot;Scandosorbus&quot; - syn. &quot;Borkhausenia&quot;; &quot;Aria&quot; × &quot;Sorbus&quot; × &quot;Torminalis&quot; hybrids
* &quot;Normeyera&quot; - &quot;Aria&quot; × &quot;Chamaemespilus&quot; × &quot;Sorbus&quot; hybrids
==Uses==
===Ornamental trees===
&quot;Sorbus&quot; species are cultivated as ornamental trees for parks and gardens and as avenue trees, and have given rise to several cultivars. The following, of mixed or uncertain parentage, have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:

* &#x27;Eastern Promise&#x27; (purple autumn colour, pink berries) 
* &#x27;Leonard Messel&#x27; named for Leonard Messel of Nymans in Sussex. (small tree to 4m, pink berries) 
* &#x27;Wisley Gold&#x27; (yellow berries)

<doc id="411292" wikidata="Q286570" url="?curid=411292" title="Tia Carrere">
<text>Althea Rae Duhinio Janairo (born January 2, 1967), known professionally as Tia Carrere (), is an American actress and singer who got her first big break as a regular on the daytime soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

Carrere played Cassandra Wong in the feature films &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot;; Juno Skinner in &quot;True Lies&quot;; Nani Pelekai in the &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; films and TV series; Queen Tyr&#x27;ahnee in &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot;; Richard Lewis&#x27; girlfriend, Cha Cha, in &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;; and starred as Sydney Fox in the television series &quot;Relic Hunter&quot;, as well as Lady Danger opposite RuPaul in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;AJ and the Queen&quot;. Carrere also appeared as a contestant in the second season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; and the fifth season of &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;. In addition to acting, Carrere has won two Grammy Awards for her music.

==Early life==
Althea Rae Duhinio Janairo was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. She is the daughter of Audrey Lee Janairo, a computer supervisor, and Alexander Janairo, a banker. She is of Filipino descent.

Carrere attended Sacred Hearts Academy, an all-girls school. She longed to be a singer as a child. Though she was eliminated during the first round of her 1985 &quot;Star Search&quot; appearance at the age of 18, she was spotted by a local producer while shopping at a Waikiki grocery store and was cast in the film &quot;Aloha Summer&quot;. Around this time, she adopted her stage name by using her sister&#x27;s nickname for her, &quot;Tia&quot;, and a variation of the last name &quot;Carrera&quot; in tribute to actress Barbara Carrera.

==Film and television career==
Following this success, Carrere returned to Los Angeles, and after working several months as a model, was hired in early 1985 for her first television role, a guest appearance on an episode of the American series &quot;Airwolf&quot;; the episode aired in November 1985, after her first on-screen television appearance, in a March 1985 episode of &quot;Cover Up&quot;. Her first major breakthrough was in the daytime soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;, where she played the role of Jade Soong Chung from 1985 to 1987. She had a guest appearance on &quot;The A-Team&quot;, which was supposed to lead to her joining the cast; her &quot;General Hospital&quot; obligations, however, prevented her from joining the team, so her character was dropped after one episode, and was never mentioned again. She also made guest appearances on &quot;MacGyver&quot; as a karate instructor in the episode &quot;The Wish Child&quot; and later as an assassin in the episode &quot;Murderer&#x27;s Sky&quot;. She also appeared on &quot;Anything but Love&quot; as the adopted daughter of Marty Gold (Richard Lewis), and on an episode of &quot;Married... with Children&quot; as Piper Bauman, a modelling rival of Kelly Bundy.

After appearing in the 1991 action films &quot;Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man&quot; and &quot;Showdown in Little Tokyo&quot;, she emerged into the public spotlight when cast as Cassandra, a rock singer and love interest of Mike Myers&#x27;s character, Wayne Campbell, in &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; (1992), a role she reprised the next year in &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot;. A trained singer, Carrere performed all of her own songs in the first film, and the &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; soundtrack features her vocals. She turned down a role in &quot;Baywatch&quot; to audition for &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;. In 1992, &quot;People&quot; named her to its annual &quot;50 most beautiful people&quot; list.

Other roles in prominent films include the parts of wealthy smuggler Juno Skinner in &quot;True Lies&quot;, a 1994 Arnold Schwarzenegger action film; a mixed African-Japanese computer expert in &quot;Rising Sun&quot;, a thriller co-written for the screen by Michael Crichton and based on his novel, starring Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes; robber Gina Walker in &quot;The Immortals&quot; in 1995; and secretary Victoria Chappell in &quot;High School High&quot;, a 1996 parody. She also starred as Ari, a space marine turned pirate, in the 1995 adventure/puzzle game &quot;The Daedalus Encounter&quot;. She appeared as the evil witch/queen in the 1997 Universal Films picture &quot;Kull the Conqueror&quot;, co-starring versus Kevin Sorbo, and starred in late-&#x27;90s M&amp;M&#x27;s commercials as herself. At the end of the decade, she was cast as Ana Ishikawa in the motion picture of the comic book character Shi, which went unproduced.
From 1999 to 2002, Carrere starred as archeology professor Sydney Fox in &quot;Relic Hunter&quot;, a syndicated action-adventure series reminiscent of &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; and &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;. At this time, Carrere was featured in the men&#x27;s magazine &quot;Maxim&quot;. &quot;Relic Hunter&quot; lasted for three contracted television seasons. Carrere then provided the voice of Lilo&#x27;s sister Nani in the animated film &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; (2002) and its spinoffs, as well as the voice of Queen Tyr&#x27;ahnee from the 2003 &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; animated series. She also provided the voice of Snookie in the 2005 animated film &quot;Aloha, Scooby-Doo!&quot;

She participated as a contestant on the popular reality show &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, and eventually placed sixth overall. Carrere later participated in the fifth season of &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, but her &quot;apprenticeship&quot; to Donald Trump, the &quot;boss&quot; of the show, was terminated in that season&#x27;s fifth week.

Carrere posed nude for the January 2003 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;. The photos were republished in the German December 2006 issue of the magazine. She has appeared as a guest star on a number of television shows, including &quot;Back to You&quot;, &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;, and &quot;Warehouse 13&quot;. She has also appeared in several episodes of season six of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; as Richard Lewis&#x27;s girlfriend. In 2020, Carrere played Lady Danger in all ten episodes of the Netflix series &quot;AJ and the Queen&quot;.

==Music career==

Carrere also maintains a singing career. In 1993, her first solo album, &quot;Dream&quot;, produced by Matt Prinz, was released and went platinum in the Philippines. That same year, she was featured on the soundtrack of &quot;&quot;, performing the ending theme, &quot;I Never Even Told You&quot;. Carrere then focused on Hawaiian music starting with her second album, &quot;Hawaiiana&quot;, which was released in June 2007 and featured Grammy Award–winning record producer Daniel Ho accompanying her on slack-key guitar and ukulele. The album was nominated for a 2008 Grammy Award under the category Best Hawaiian Music Album.

In 2009, Carrere served as co-host for the pre–Grammy Awards telecast online event alongside Wayne Brady. She won a Grammy Award in 2009 for her third album, &quot;″Ikena&quot;, and her 2010 album &quot;He Nani&quot; was also nominated for a Grammy. In 2011, she won her second Grammy Award for her album &quot;Huana Ke Aloha&quot;.

<text>Nahal () (acronym of &quot;Noar Halutzi Lohem&quot;, lit. Fighting Pioneer Youth) is a program that combines military service with mostly social welfare and informal education projects such as youth movement activities, as well as training in entrepreneurship in urban development areas. Prior to the 1990s it was a paramilitary Israel Defense Forces program that combined military service and the establishment of agricultural settlements, often in peripheral areas.

The Nahal groups of soldiers formed the core of the Nahal Infantry Brigade.

==History==
In 1948, a &quot;gar&#x27;in&quot; (core group) of Jewish pioneers wrote to Israel&#x27;s first and then-current Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, requesting that members be allowed to do their military service as a group rather than being split up into different units at random. In response to this letter, Ben-Gurion created the Nahal program, which combined military service and farming.

Some 108 kibbutzim and agricultural settlements were established by the Nahal, many of them on Israel&#x27;s borders.

Members of Nahal units, known as &quot;garinei Nahal&quot; (Nahal seeds) have served together in various army units, most famously in the &quot;Nahal Mutznakh&quot; (Airborne Nahal) battalion of the Paratroopers Brigade, the reserve battalion of which was instrumental in the Israeli victory in the Battle of Jerusalem during the 1967 Six-Day War. Many settlements founded by Nahal units in Galilee, the Negev, and the West Bank are still thriving today, including settlements formerly located in the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip. Today, a gar&#x27;in is usually a group formed by a youth movement, such as the Israeli Scouts, for the purpose of volunteer work.

==Nahal and Youth Command==
Today, there are two distinct units carrying on the historical tradition and name of the Nahal. The first is a large, non-combat command belonging to the IDF Education Corps, whose primary responsibility is to organize and coordinate the volunteer-type programs and activities that made the original Nahal unit famous in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. This command has a full staff of educational officers and soldiers, and also sponsors other endeavours such as Gadna, a week-long &#x27;introduction&#x27; to the military for high-schoolers in which they become acquainted with the history, traditions, and routines of the military that they are about to join.

==Nahal group==
The Nahal group (Hebrew: גרעין נחל) is a form of community service developed in Israel, which combines social volunteerism, agriculture and military service. The service is divided into several parts:
* The military period (פרק צבאי)
* The national mission period (פרק משימה)
* Routine security measures (only for the male members) (בט&quot;ש)
* Unpaid military service period (Military service with no payment) (של&quot;ת) (although this part doesn’t exist anymore for most Nahal groups)

In addition, most of the Nahal group members have done a &quot;year of service&quot; (שנת שירות) prior to enlistment, enlisting afterwards with the same group with whom they did the year of service.

The order of the periods is permanent, but there are changes in the length of the periods, in accordance with the recruitment cycles. Also, it is possible to have the unpaid military service period either at the beginning or at the end of each course.

===The military period===
During the first military period, the members of the Nahal group serve in the Nahal infantry brigade together. The male members have a combat service as part of the 50th battalion, Caracal Battalion, or in different positions in the Education and Youth Corps, and the female members serve in the Caracal Battalion or in different positions in the Education and Youth Corps and the Nahal headquarters. As part of their service, the members of the same group are entitled to serve in the same military unit (the 50th battalion, in the Caracal Battalion and in basic training of the female soldiers and the non-combat soldiers), and to hold a group meeting once in a while. At the end of their military service, after the release of the female Nahal soldiers, the remaining Nahal members return for half a year of routine security measures activities.

===The national mission period===
The national mission period lasts a year, in which all the core group stays together, under the command of the Education and Youth Corps. During the establishment of the state, the national mission was mostly the establishment of new settlements in periphery areas to serve as a security presence able to respond to terrorist incursions such as in the Jordan Valley (by means of Nahal settlements) and expansion of the existing kibbutzim. Over the years, and in accordance with the changes in the Israeli society, the national mission has changed to helping the poor populations throughout the country and nowadays the Nahal groups perform in the National mission period social and educational-based missions in the social periphery of the state of Israel. The soldiers live in apartments in different local authorities, and work in different education tasks in the schools, in the community centers, in the youth clubs, in the absorption centers, etc. The group is accompanied by Military commanders, the Youth organizers in the local authorities and representatives of the youth movement to which the group belongs to core.

The unpaid military-service periods are a remainder of the Nahal course which included living in kibbutzim, but today are more similar to the national mission periods, yet are shorter and are less monitored by the army.

In general, the military service of male members of the Nahal group is four months longer than the military service of most soldiers. However, some of the Nahal groups continue to work together, anyway, even after the military service, as part of adult movements or choose to continue living together, regardless of their original movement.

===The Orthodox Nahal===
Under the Nahal framework, there is now also a route in which soldiers who originate from the Jewish ultra-Orthodox sector could join. They serve for two years in the 97th battalion of the Kfir Brigade, and in addition they go to a one-year school in order to complete their studies and get a matriculation certificate or in order to get a profession.

==The Nahal Band==
Lahakat HaNahal (The Nahal Band or the Nahal Entertainment Troupe) is a military music troupe known for its Eretz Israel songs. Founded in 1950, it has become an integral part in Israeli military culture. It was the second major band to be founded in the State of Israel after the Israel Defense Forces Orchestra. In the early 1960s, there were many changes in the band, especially in the musical production. The accordion was joined by percussion, as well as brass and wind instruments. In April 1978, some songs by the band; as well as some people that were once in the band; were featured on &quot;The Band&quot;, a comedic musical film about the band in 1968 during the War of Attrition. The band has also been featured on the Israeli telenovela HaShir Shelanu. The band has made multiple albums, including &quot;From The Nahal With Love&quot; (1966), &quot;The Nahal Is Coming&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Twenty First Program&quot; (1969). Many Israeli singers and entertainers began their careers in Lahakat HaNahal, among them Tuvia Tzafir, Neomy Polani and Gidi Gov.

The band&#x27;s most notable song is &quot;Shir LaShalom&quot; (A song for peace), recorded and released at the height of the War of Attrition and made famous worldwide due to its association with the Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin as it was sung by Rabin during the rally in which the assassination took place.

Other notable members include:
* Arik Einstein, Israeli rock songwriter
* Danny Sanderson, American-Israeli musician
* Shalom Hanoch, a lyricist and composer considered to be the father of Israeli rock
* Yossi Banai, one of the original members of the band

Most of the members of the band Kaveret were formerly members of the Nahal Band.

==Nahal infantry brigade==

The Nahal Brigade was formed around core groups of Airborne Nahal soldiers in 1982 due to the growing need for infantry manpower in the wake of the 1982 Lebanon War. As a result, it maintains parts of the Nahal insignia and Nahal groups continue to serve there.

===Weapons and gear===
The Nahal brigade uses the IMI Tavor TAR-21 rifle.

==Awards and recognition==
In 1984, Nahal was awarded the Israel Prize for its special contribution to society and the State of Israel.

==Nahal Africa==
In the 1960s there was an Israeli aid project for developing countries, in Africa, Asia and South America, with the help of the Nahal Corps. The reasons for the establishment of this project were, among other things, an attempt to create areas of influence in the bordering countries that have political ties with countries that were in direct conflict with Israel. This project helped create the international image of the State of Israel, and opened the door to economic and security cooperation.

Guinea was the first location for this project. John Tatega, the secretary general of the trade unions in Guinea, showed interest in the Israeli army and its methods for making the desert flourish, and following negotiations, a delegation of four Israeli Nahal officers was sent to Guinea who helped to establish similar units in the Ghanaian army organized in a divisional framework called the &quot;Builders Brigade&quot;. This division helped create an employment framework for thousands of Guineans, promoted the undeveloped agriculture for the country, and united members of different tribes with a history of hostility in one framework. John Tatega was at the head of the framework and on the recommendation of the Israelis he received a rank equivalent to lieutenant colonel.

Dozens of Israeli Nahal delegations participated in the project that began in Guinea and continued in Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi, the Ivory Coast, the Central African Republic, Chad, Cameroon, Togo; and outside Africa: Iran, Singapore, Ecuador, Bolivia and more. In addition, representative delegations from those countries came to Israel to learn from the predictions. The Nahal assisted in the creation of paramilitary or military frameworks, and in the development of agricultural and forestry methods.

The Nahal&#x27;s activities abroad and on the international level largely ceased due to the deterioration of Israel&#x27;s political relations after the Six Day War, however many of the frameworks that were established continued to function, and certain collaborations on different levels even continued.For example Kenya, where the Nahal operated, and which was the beginning of the political relationship with it, which finally led to some cooperation during &quot;Operation Jonathan&quot; to free Entebbe hostages.

<text>The Office of Communications, commonly known as Ofcom, is the government-approved regulatory and competition authority for the broadcasting, telecommunications and postal industries of the United Kingdom.

Ofcom has wide-ranging powers across the television, radio, telecoms and postal sectors. It has a statutory duty to represent the interests of citizens and consumers by promoting competition and protecting the public from harmful or offensive material.

Some of the main areas Ofcom regulates are TV and radio standards, broadband and phones, video-sharing platforms online, the wireless spectrum and postal services.
The regulator was initially established by the  (c. 11) and received its full authority from the Communications Act 2003 (c. 21).

==History==
On 20 June 2001, the Queen&#x27;s Speech to the UK Parliament announced the creation of Ofcom. The new body, which was to replace several existing authorities, was conceived as a &quot;super-regulator&quot; to oversee media channels that were rapidly converging through digital transmission.

On 29 December 2003, Ofcom launched, formally inheriting the duties that had previously been the responsibility of five different regulators:

*the Broadcasting Standards Commission
*the Independent Television Commission
*the Office of Telecommunications (Oftel)
*the Radio Authority
*the Radiocommunications Agency

In July 2009, Conservative Party opposition leader David Cameron referenced Ofcom in a speech against the proliferation of quangos: 

Under Cameron&#x27;s subsequent premiership of the 2010 UK coalition government, the Public Bodies Act 2011 did remove or modify several of Ofcom&#x27;s duties, although it did not substantially reduce Ofcom&#x27;s remit.

On 1 October 2011, Ofcom took over responsibility for regulating the postal services industry from the Postal Services Commission (Postcomm).

In April 2015, Ofcom announced that telephone companies would have to provide customers with a set charge for the cost of calling numbers starting with 084, 087 and 09. The streamlining of these charges must be printed in each customer&#x27;s contract and monthly bills. The change came into force on 1 July 2015 and affected over 175 million phone numbers, making it the biggest overhaul of telephoning in over a decade.

On 1 January 2016, the regulation of video on demand was transferred to Ofcom from ATVOD, the Authority for Television on Demand.

The Digital Economy Act 2017 extended Ofcom&#x27;s remit and powers. Ofcom were given powers concerning the minimum broadband speed provided by Internet service providers, the ability to financially penalise communications providers for failing to comply with licence commitments and the power to require public service broadcasters to include a minimum quantity of children&#x27;s programming made in the United Kingdom. The act also transferred to Ofcom the regulation of the BBC, a duty previously undertaken by the BBC Trust, and updated the Ofcom Electronic Communications Code to make it easier for telecommunications companies to erect and extend mobile masts.

Following a consultation over the Online Harms White Paper published by the UK government in April 2019, the government announced in February 2020 that it intended Ofcom to have a greater role in Internet regulation to protect users from &quot;harmful and illegal content&quot;.

In July 2022, Ofcom received additional tools to prevent, identify and remove any content that depicts child sexual abuse and exploitation. These tools will be introduced through an amendment to the Online Safety Bill. Ofcom will be allowed to penalise those tech firms that do not comply, either by fines up to £18m or by 10% of the company&#x27;s annual turnover, whichever amount is higher.

On 1 February 2025, Ofcom took the regulation of Controlled Premium Rate Services (CPRS) back in-house. These services were previously regulated by the Phone-paid Services Authority (PSA) which was disbanded on 31 January 2025 as Ofcom withdrew its formal approval of the former PSA Code of Practice.

===News International phone hacking scandal===

In July 2011, in the wake of the News International phone hacking scandal, Ofcom came under pressure to launch an inquiry into whether the parent company of News International, News Corporation, was still the &quot;fit and proper&quot; owner of a controlling stake in the satellite broadcasting company British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB). On 13 July former Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged Ofcom to launch an investigation. On 15 July the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg stated that the Government would launch a review of laws on what constituted a &quot;fit and proper&quot; owner for broadcasting companies in the United Kingdom, and that anyone found not to meet that standard can be forced to give up their current holdings in a company.

On 22 July 2011, it was reported that Ofcom had begun an investigation into whether the phone-hacking scandal may have changed BSkyB&#x27;s status as the &quot;fit and proper&quot; holder of a UK broadcasting licence. On the same day Ed Richards, the then chief executive of Ofcom, replied to Simon Hughes MP, Don Foster MP and Tim Farron MP following a letter which they had written to him on 8 July concerning News Corporation&#x27;s shareholding in BSkyB. In the letter Richards confirmed that Ofcom considers that News Corporation&#x27;s current shareholding of 39.14% in BSkyB does give it a material influence over the company; that Ofcom is not precluded from acting by ongoing police investigations; and that Ofcom&#x27;s process is not dependent upon a criminal conviction being secured.

In April 2012, Ofcom&#x27;s probe moved from a monitoring phase to an &quot;evidence gathering&quot; phase.

===Timeline of communications regulators===


==Activities==

===Television and radio===

Ofcom licenses all UK commercial television and radio services in the UK. Broadcasters must comply by the terms of their licence, or risk having it revoked. Ofcom also publishes the Broadcasting Code, a series of rules which all broadcast content on television and radio must follow. The Broadcasting Code requires that content inappropriate for children should not be broadcast between the hours of 5:30a.m. and 9:00p.m. Premium-rate film services may broadcast content equivalent to a BBFC 15 certificate at any time of day provided a PIN-protected system is in place to restrict access to those authorised to view it. The broadcasting of pornography with a BBFC R18 certificate is not permitted. In 2010 Ofcom revoked the licences of four free-to-air television channels for promoting adult chat services during daytime hours and transmitting content that was too sexually explicit. The companies involved were fined £157,250. Ofcom&#x27;s jurisdiction does not cover television and radio channels which are broadcast in the UK but licensed abroad. In 2012 Ofcom lodged a complaint with the Dutch media regulator regarding the content of adult chat television channels which are broadcast in the UK but licensed in the Netherlands. Based on a survey of 200 British respondents, Ofcom published in 2016 a list of about 50 words classified in four grades of offensiveness, from &quot;milder&quot; to &quot;strongest&quot;.

=== Telephone and broadband ===

Ofcom regulates the UK telecoms sector, defining and enforcing the conditions by which all mobile and fixed-line phone and broadband companies must abide. These &#x27;general conditions&#x27; are wide-ranging rules relating to matters such as telephone numbering, emergency services, sales, marketing and interconnection standards. Ofcom&#x27;s investigation unit monitors compliance with the conditions and resolves disputes between providers.

Ofcom is also the competition authority for telecoms, enforcing remedies in markets where it believes dominant operators may have a potentially harmful influence on competition or consumers. One of its most high-profile interventions was to require BT to split its wholesale and retail arms into separate companies, bringing about the creation of Openreach which supplies wholesale services to both BT Retail and competing providers.

On 1 July 2015, Ofcom made a number of changes to the way phone calls to UK service numbers would be charged. Under the new legislation, which was promoted by an information campaign entitled UK Calling, call charges must be clearly stated on all materials that advertise a service number. The changes came after research found that callers are often confused about service call charges, and thus can avoid calling these numbers. The July 2015 changes also saw &#x27;freephone numbers&#x27; 0800 and 0808 become free to call from both mobiles and landlines.

In March 2016, Ofcom launched an interactive &quot;Mobile coverage and fixed broadband checker&quot;, allowing people to check mobile coverage and broadband speeds via their post code.

===Spectrum licensing and protection===

Ofcom is responsible for the management, regulation, assignment and licensing of the electromagnetic spectrum in the UK, and licenses portions of it for use in television and radio broadcasts, mobile phone transmissions, private communications networks, wireless devices and so on. The process of licensing varies depending on the type of use required. Some licences simply have to be applied and paid for; other commercial licences are subject to a bidding process. Most of the procedures in place have been inherited from the systems used by the previous regulators. However, Ofcom may change some of these processes in future.

Ofcom protects the radio spectrum in a number of ways:

* Working within international organisations (ITU, CEPT and BEREC).
* Licensing UK-controlled commercial radio spectrum; the Ministry of Defence controls its own spectrum. Within the international framework for frequency use; Ofcom liaises through the UK Government to produce the UKFAT (UK Frequency Allocation Table). The current table was produced in 2017.
* Investigate and, when necessary, carry out enforcement activities to clear interference or illegal use from the spectrum. Until June 2010 Ofcom investigated all interference cases within the UK. Interference reporting has now been transferred to the BBC. This contract specifically excludes any requirement to investigate interference relating to AM radio reception. Commercial and spectrum licence holders report to Ofcom and in all cases illegal (&quot;pirate&quot;) radio operations are still reported to Ofcom.

===Postal services===
In October 2010 the government announced plans for Ofcom to inherit the functions of Postcomm as part of a wider set of public service sell-off measures. Following the Postal Services Act 2011 regulatory responsibility for postal services transferred to Ofcom on 1 October 2011, with its primary duty to maintain the UK&#x27;s six-day-a-week universal postal service.

===Consultations===

Ofcom makes extensive use of consultations with industry and the public to help it make decisions based upon the evidence presented. Consultation processes begin with publishing documents on its website, asking for views and responses. If the document is perceived to be long and complicated, a plain English is usually published as well. A period, usually of 10 weeks, is allowed for interested persons, companies or organisations to send in their responses to the consultation.

After this consultation period, Ofcom publishes all the responses on its website, excluding any personal or confidential information. Ofcom then prepares a summary of the responses received, and uses this information as a basis for its decisions.

==UK hate speech regulation==
Since 1 January 2021, Ofcom has defined hate speech as &quot;all forms of expression which spread, incite, promote or justify hatred based on intolerance on the grounds of disability, ethnicity, social origin, sex, gender, gender reassignment, nationality, race, religion or belief, sexual orientation, colour, genetic features, language, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth or age.&quot; However, there is concern that Ofcom&#x27;s broad definition of hate speech can easily result in the unjustified censorship of controversial opinions, however legitimate they might be.

==Controversies==

=== Expenditure ===
Ofcom has received criticism for incurring unnecessary costs as a result of &quot;extravagant Thames-side offices&quot; and a &quot;top-heavy salary bill&quot;, for inflexibility in its regulation of commercial radio, and for &quot;poor service&quot;. In response to ongoing expenditure concerns, Ofcom made the following statement regarding the 2017/2018 budget: &quot;Ofcom has delivered 12 consecutive years of like-for-like real-terms budget reductions, and we will continue to reduce spending wherever we can.&quot;

=== Al Jazeera ===
The Qatar-based news media outlet was reported to Ofcom in January 2017, following an exposé about Israeli diplomatic corps irregularities and influence peddling amongst political and student groups in the UK.
After investigations exceeding eight months, Ofcom reported that Al Jazeera was in line with journalism standards and cleared the filmmakers of the allegations.

=== Press TV ===
In May 2011, Ofcom ruled that Press TV, an Iranian English-language satellite channel, was responsible for a serious breach of UK broadcasting rules and could face a fine for airing an interview with Maziar Bahari, the &quot;Newsweek&quot; journalist arrested covering the Iranian presidential election in 2009, that was obtained by force while he was held in a Tehran jail. Press TV said that Bahari did not &quot;dispute the truth and accuracy&quot; of the extract of the interview, so it made &quot;no logical sense&quot; to require his consent.

===Sitefinder database and freedom of information===
The Sitefinder database is a national database of mobile phone base stations in the UK. In September 2007, an Information Tribunal ruled that the public should have access to the database under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. However, as Ofcom has no legal power to force mobile phone operators to add information to the database, UK mobile phone operators consequently ceased updating it.
Ofcom appealed against the Freedom of Information Act ruling, together with one UK mobile operator – T-Mobile. This has led to accusations of the organisation&#x27;s complicity with the mobile telecommunications industry in keeping information about mast locations secret. Ofcom&#x27;s stated reasons for the appeal have ranged from &quot;preventing terrorist attacks&quot; on the sites of phone masts to &quot;protecting the intellectual property&quot; of the mobile telecommunications industry.

In April 2008, the High Court found in favour of the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office and over-ruled Ofcom&#x27;s objections. Ofcom appealed to the Supreme Court, who in turn referred a point of law to the European Court of Justice, and then in October 2011 ordered that the matter should be remitted to the Information Rights Tribunal to reconsider the public interest balancing exercise. On 12 December 2012, the Information Rights Tribunal upheld its decision of 4 September 2007.

===Deryn Consulting controversy===
In 2017, Ofcom&#x27;s advisory committee for Wales awarded Deryn Consulting a contract to monitor the National Assembly for Wales and Welsh Government. It was subsequently reported that the contract had not been put out to tender and that Huw Roberts and Nerys Evans held positions for both Deryn and Ofcom. The contract was terminated and Ofcom concluded that it had broken its own procurement rules.

===Abu Dhabi TV===
Abu Dhabi TV, owned by the Abu Dhabi Media state enterprise, was condemned by Ofcom for broadcasting a televised interview of the confessions made by a Qatari citizen, Dr. Mahmoud Al-Jaida, while he was detained arbitrarily in the Abu Dhabi prisons in 2013. The National Human Rights Committee of the State of Qatar welcomed Ofcom&#x27;s decision. Under the decision, it was stated that on 28 June 2017, the Abu Dhabi TV channel, which is affiliated with Abu Dhabi Media Company P.J.S.C &quot;ADMC&quot;, licensed under Ofcom had broadcast an interview recording titled &quot;Mahmoud Al-Jaidah and the clandestine organization in UAE&quot;. According to the decision, the aired interview was recorded against the consent of Dr. Al-Jaidah, who was physically tortured during his time in the Abu Dhabi prison. The activity had constituted a serious breach of the principles of fairness and privacy detailed in the Ofcom Broadcasting Code.

=== CGTN ===
In 2019, Ofcom began an investigation into the Chinese international channel CGTN, owned by state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV), following allegations that a forced confession from British former journalist Peter Humphrey was broadcast on the channel. In addition, it also received four formal complaints over similar alleged confessions. In November, Hong Kong activist and former UK consulate worker Simon Cheng filed a complaint to Ofcom a week after CGTN released a video of him admitting to &quot;soliciting prostitution&quot;, which Cheng said he was forced to make.

In early 2021, Ofcom revoked the UK broadcasting licence of CGTN. In a statement, it noted that the licence holder for the channel, Star China Media Ltd., did not have editorial responsibility over the channel, which was against legal requirements. It was also unable to hand over the licence to a corporation called &quot;China Global Television Network Corporation&quot; (CGTNC), on the grounds that the company was &quot;ultimately controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, which is not permitted under UK broadcasting law&quot;. Ofcom later fined CGTN £225,000 for &quot;breaching rules on fairness, privacy and due impartiality&quot;.

Following the revocation, both the Chinese government and state media began targeting the BBC, accusing it of producing &quot;fake news&quot; in its coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China and the Xinjiang internment camps. CGTN itself claimed that Ofcom was &quot;manipulated by extreme right-wing organizations and anti-China forces&quot;.

=== Criticism of Michael Grade ===
In June 2022, the BBC&#x27;s historian, Jean Seaton, publicy said that Michael Grade &quot;is too lazy, too old, and has too many conflicts of interest,&quot; according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;. She called his appointment as chairman a means of &quot;bullying&quot; the BBC.

=== GB News===
Ofcom has been criticized by some for being seen as too lenient on GB News, which has breached Ofcom rules on a regular basis. Despite having found GB News in breach of Ofcom rules 11 times in a year, Ofcom has refused to levy any fines or penalties against the network, instead preferring to simply issue warnings. Ofcom has previously also stated that GB News can use sitting politicians as presenters on its network. Andrew Neil, the founder of GB News who has since left, has said that Ofcom needs to &quot;grow a backbone and quick” regarding letting politicians host TV programmes.

<text>&quot;Tidewater&quot; is a term for the north Atlantic Plain region of the United States. It is located east of the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line and north of the Deep South. It encompasses the Chesapeake Bay and includes Delaware, the remainder of the Delmarva Peninsula, Southern Maryland and the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Washington, D.C., Eastern Virginia, and Eastern North Carolina.

== Definition ==
Culturally, the Tidewater region usually includes the low-lying plains of southeast Virginia, northeastern North Carolina, southern Maryland and the Chesapeake Bay.

The cultural Tidewater region got its name from the effects of the changing tides on local rivers, sounds, and the ocean. The area has a centuries-old cultural heritage that sets the Tidewater region apart from the adjacent inland parts of the United States, especially with respect to its distinctive dialects of English, which are gradually disappearing, along with its islands and its receding shoreline.

== Geography ==
The tidewater region developed when sea level rose after the last ice age, resulting in the flooding of river valleys in the coastal plain. Such flooded river valleys now make up the tidewater since tides continue to affect water levels far inland, in some cases all the way west to the Fall Line. It is generally flat and low, with large expanses near the tidal shorelines composed of tidal marsh and swamp. Much of the area is covered with pocosin and the higher areas are used for agricultural farmlands. Geographically, in North Carolina and Virginia the Tidewater area is the land between the Suffolk Scarp and the Atlantic Ocean. In Maryland the Tidewater area is the flooded river areas below the Fall Line. The Hampton Roads area of Virginia is considered to be a Tidewater region. Southern Maryland and the Eastern Shore, parts of Delaware round out the northern part of the region on the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays.

The term tidewater may be correctly applied to all portions of any area, including Virginia, where the water level is affected by the tides (more specifically, where the water level rises when the tide comes in). In the case of Virginia, the Tidewater region includes the land east of the Fall Line, the natural border with the Piedmont Region. It includes Hampton Roads, the rest of the Virginia Peninsula, the Middle Peninsula, the Northern Neck, and the Eastern Shore.

Planters in the early American colonies extended their tobacco and peanut productions above the Fall Line, where waterfalls or rapids mark the end of the Tidewater and the beginning of the foothill region known as the Piedmont.

Tidewater is host to flora commonly associated with the South Atlantic pine forests and lower Southeast Coastal Plain maritime flora, the latter found primarily in southeastern Virginia.

==Politics==
The Tidewater region has remained politically competitive since the 2010s, even as much of the rest of the Southern United States has aligned towards the Republican Party. It contains the states of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina, as well as Washington, D.C.. The heavily Democratic Northeast megalopolis includes Maryland, Delaware, and Northern Virginia. The Eastern Shore of Maryland is strongly Republican.

As of 2024, Democrats hold the governorships of Delaware, Maryland, and North Carolina, while Republicans hold the Virginia governorship.

==Regional accents==
A distinctive non-rhotic accent of the Old South was spoken in the Tidewater coastal region of Virginia. Commonly known as a Tidewater accent, it is best associated with upper-class white speakers of the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the actual islands of the Chesapeake themselves, a separate rhotic accent survives among the locals.

<doc id="411309" wikidata="Q14088448" url="?curid=411309" title="Cadence">
<text>In Western musical theory, a cadence () is the end of a phrase in which the melody or harmony creates a sense of full or partial resolution, especially in music of the 16th century onwards. A harmonic cadence is a progression of two or more chords that concludes a phrase, section, or piece of music. A rhythmic cadence is a characteristic rhythmic pattern that indicates the end of a phrase. A cadence can be labeled &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;strong&quot; depending on the impression of finality it gives. 

While cadences are usually classified by specific chord or melodic progressions, the use of such progressions does not necessarily constitute a cadence—there must be a sense of closure, as at the end of a phrase. Harmonic rhythm plays an important part in determining where a cadence occurs. The word &quot;cadence&quot; sometimes slightly shifts its meaning depending on the context; for example, it can be used to refer to the last few notes of a particular phrase, or to just the final chord of that phrase, or to types of chord progressions that are suitable for phrase endings in general.

Cadences are strong indicators of the tonic or central pitch of a passage or piece. The musicologist Edward Lowinsky proposed that the cadence was the &quot;cradle of tonality&quot;.

== Nomenclature across the world ==

==Common classifications==
Cadences are divided into four main types, according to their harmonic progression: &quot;authentic&quot; (typically &quot;perfect authentic&quot; or &quot;imperfect authentic&quot;), &quot;half&quot;, &quot;plagal&quot;, and &quot;deceptive&quot;. Typically, phrases end on authentic or half cadences, and the terms &quot;plagal&quot; and &quot;deceptive&quot; refer to motion that avoids or follows a phrase-ending cadence. Each cadence can be described using the Roman numeral system of naming chords.

===Authentic cadence===
An authentic cadence is a cadence from the dominant chord (V) to the root chord (I). During the dominant chord, a seventh above the dominant may be added to create a dominant seventh chord (V7); the dominant chord may also be preceded by a cadential chord. &quot;The Harvard Concise Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; says, &quot;This cadence is a microcosm of the tonal system, and is the most direct means of establishing a pitch as tonic. It is virtually obligatory as the final structural cadence of a tonal work.&quot; Authentic cadences are generally classified as either &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;imperfect&quot;. The phrase &quot;perfect cadence&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for &quot;authentic cadence&quot; but can also have a more precise meaning depending on the chord voicing.

====Perfect authentic cadence====
In a perfect authentic cadence (PAC), the chords are in root position – that is, the roots of both chords are in the bass – and the tonic is in the highest voice of the final chord. This is generally considered the strongest type of cadence and often found at structurally defining moments. Music theorist William Caplin writes that the perfect authentic cadence &quot;achieves complete harmonic and melodic closure.&quot;
====Imperfect authentic cadence====

There are three types of imperfect authentic cadences (IAC):

*&quot;Root position IAC&quot; (shown below): Similar to a perfect authentic cadence, but the highest voice is not the tonic.

*&quot;Inverted IAC&quot;: Similar to a perfect authentic cadence, but one or both chords are inverted.
*&quot;Leading-tone IAC&quot;: The penultimate (V) chord is replaced with a chord based on the leading-tone (viio chord).

=====Evaded cadence=====

An evaded cadence (a subtype of the inverted IAC) moves from a dominant seventh third inversion chord (V) to a first inversion tonic chord (I). Because the seventh of the dominant chord must fall stepwise to the third of the tonic chord, it forces the cadence to resolve to the less stable first inversion chord. To achieve this, a root position V usually changes to a V right before resolution, thereby &quot;evading&quot; the root-position I chord that would usually follow a root-position V. (See also inverted cadence below.)

===Half cadence===
A half cadence (also called an &quot;imperfect cadence&quot; or &quot;semicadence&quot;) is any cadence ending on V, whether preceded by II (V of V), ii, vi, IV, or I—or any other chord. Because it sounds incomplete or suspended, the half cadence is considered a weak cadence that calls for continuation.

Several types of half cadences are described below.

====Phrygian half cadence====
A Phrygian half cadence is a half cadence iv6–V in minor, so named because the semitonal motion in the bass (sixth degree to fifth degree) resembles the half-step heard in the ii–I of the 15th-century cadence in the Phrygian mode. Due to its being a survival from modal Renaissance harmony this cadence gives an archaic sound, especially when preceded by v (v–iv6–V). A characteristic gesture in Baroque music, the Phrygian cadence often concluded a slow movement immediately followed (&quot;attacca&quot;) by a faster one. 
====Lydian cadence====
A Lydian cadence is similar to the Phrygian half cadence, involving iv6–V in the minor. The difference is that in the Lydian cadence, the whole iv6 is raised by a half step. In other words, the Phrygian half cadence begins with the first chord built on scale degree , while the Lydian half cadence is built on the scale degree .

====Burgundian cadences====
Burgundian cadences became popular in Burgundian music. Note the parallel fourths between the upper voices.

====Plagal half cadence====
The rare plagal half cadence involves a I–IV progression. Like an authentic cadence (V–I), the plagal half cadence involves an ascending fourth (or, by inversion, a descending fifth). The plagal half cadence is a weak cadence, ordinarily at the ending of an antecedent phrase, after which a consequent phrase commences. One example of this use is in &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;. But in one very unusual occurrence – the end of the exposition of the first movement of Brahms&#x27; Clarinet Trio, Op. 114—it is used to complete not just a musical phrase but an entire section of a movement.

===Plagal cadence===

A plagal cadence is a cadence from IV to I. It is also known as the &quot;Amen cadence&quot; because of its frequent setting to the text &quot;Amen&quot; in hymns.

William Caplin disputes the existence of plagal cadences in music of the classical era although they begin to appear in the nineteenth century:

The plagal cadence may be interpreted as I–V if the IV-I cadence is perceived as a modulation in which the IV chord becomes the I chord of the new tonic key and the I chord of the previous key is now a dominant chord in the modulated key. (Cf. §Half cadence above and Secondary dominant.)

==== Minor plagal cadence ====
A minor plagal cadence, also known as a perfect plagal cadence, uses the minor iv instead of a major IV. With a very similar voice leading to a perfect cadence, the minor plagal cadence is a strong resolution to the tonic.
====Moravian cadence====
The Moravian cadence, which can be found in the works of Leoš Janáček and Bohuslav Martinů amongst others, is a form of plagal cadence in which the outer notes of the first chord each move inwards by a tone to the second. (IVadd6 → I6). An early suggestion of the Moravian cadence in classical music occurs in Antonín Dvořák’s &quot;New World&quot; Symphony.

===Deceptive cadence===

Also known as an interrupted or false cadence, the deceptive cadence is a cadence from V to any chord other than the tonic (I), usually the submediant (VI). This is the most important irregular resolution, most commonly V7–vi (or V7–VI) in major or V7–VI in minor. This is considered a weak cadence because of the &quot;hanging&quot; (suspended) feeling it invokes.
At the beginning of the final movement of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s 9th Symphony, the listener hears a string of many deceptive cadences progressing from V to IV6.

One of the most striking uses of this cadence is in the A-minor section at the end of the exposition in the first movement of Brahms&#x27; Third Symphony. The music progresses to an implied E minor dominant (B7) with a rapid chromatic scale upwards but suddenly sidesteps to C major. The same device is used again in the recapitulation; this time the sidestep is—as one would expect—to F major, the tonic key of the whole Symphony.

The interrupted cadence is also frequently used in popular music. For example, the Pink Floyd song &quot;Bring the Boys Back Home&quot; ends with such a cadence (at approximately 0:45–50).

== Other classifications ==

===Inverted cadence===
An inverted cadence (also called a &quot;medial cadence&quot;) inverts the last chord. It may be restricted only to the perfect and imperfect cadence, or only to the perfect cadence, or it may apply to cadences of all types. To distinguish them from this form, the other, more common forms of cadences listed above are known as &quot;radical cadences&quot;.

===Rhythmic classifications===

Cadences can also be classified by their rhythmic position:

* A metrically accented cadence has its final note in a metrically strong position, typically the downbeat of a measure.
* A metrically unaccented cadence has its final note in a metrically weak position, for instance, after a long appoggiatura.

Metrically accented cadences are considered stronger and are generally of greater structural significance. In the past, the terms &quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; were sometimes used to describe rhythmically &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;weak&quot; cadences, but these terms have not been generally used since at least the mid-1980s. Susan McClary has written extensively on the gendered terminology of music and music theory in her book &quot;Feminine Endings.&quot;

The example below shows a metrically unaccented cadence (IV–V–I). The final chord is postponed to fall on a weak beat.

===Picardy third===
A Picardy third (or Picardy cadence) is a harmonic device that originated in Western music in the Renaissance era. It refers to the use of a major chord of the tonic at the end of a musical section that is either modal or in a minor key. The example below shows a picardy third in the final chord, from J.S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;Jesu, meine Freude&quot; (Jesus, My Joy), mm. 12–13.

===Upper leading-tone cadence===

This example from a well-known 16th-century lamentation shows a cadence that appears to imply the use of an upper leading-tone, a debate over which was documented in Rome c. 1540. The final three written notes in the upper voice are printed B–C–D, in which case the customary trill on the second to last note should be played using D and C. However, convention implied that the written C should be played as a C in this context, and a cadential trill of a whole tone on the second to last note would then require a D/E, the upper leading-tone of D. Presumably, the debate was over whether to use D–C or D–C for the trill.

==In medieval and Renaissance polyphony==
Medieval and Renaissance cadences are based upon dyads rather than chords. The first theoretical mention of cadences comes from Guido of Arezzo&#x27;s description of the &quot;occursus&quot; in his Micrologus, where he uses the term to mean where the two lines of a two-part polyphonic phrase end in a unison.

=== Clausula vera ===
A clausula or clausula vera (&quot;true close&quot;) is a dyadic or intervallic, rather than chordal or harmonic, cadence. In a clausula vera, two voices approach an octave or unison through stepwise motion in contrary motion.

In three voices, the third voice often adds a falling fifth creating a cadence similar to the authentic cadence in tonal music.

According to Carl Dahlhaus, &quot;as late as the 13th century the half step was experienced as a problematic interval not easily understood, as the remainder between the perfect fourth and the ditone:

:formula_1
In a melodic half step, listeners of the time perceived no tendency of the lower tone toward the upper, or the upper toward the lower. The second tone was not the &#x27;goal&#x27; of the first. Instead, musicians avoided the half step in clausulas because, to their ears, it lacked clarity as an interval. Beginning in the 13th century, cadences begin to require motion in one voice by half step and the other a whole step in contrary motion.

=== Plagal cadence ===
A plagal cadence was found occasionally as an interior cadence, with the lower voice in two-part writing moving up a perfect fifth or down a perfect fourth.

=== Rest ===
A rest in one voice may also be used as a weak interior cadence. The example below, Lassus&#x27;s &quot;Qui vult venire post me&quot;, mm. 3–5, shows a rest in the third measure.

=== Evaded cadence ===
In counterpoint, an evaded cadence is one where one of the voices in a suspension does not resolve as expected, and the voices together resolve to a consonance other than an octave or unison (a perfect fifth, a sixth, or a third).

=== Corelli cadence ===
The Corelli cadence, or Corelli clash, named for its association with the violin music of the Corelli school, is a cadence characterized by a major and/or minor second clash between the tonic and the leading-tone or the tonic and supertonic. An example is shown below.

=== English cadence ===
Another &quot;clash cadence&quot;, the English cadence, is a contrapuntal pattern particular to the authentic or perfect cadence. It features the blue seventh against the dominant chord, which in the key of C would be B and G–B–D. Popular with English composers of the High Renaissance and Restoration periods in the 16th and 17th centuries, the English cadence is described as sounding archaic or old-fashioned. It was first given its name in the 20th century.

The hallmark of this device is the dissonant augmented octave (compound augmented unison) produced by a false relation between the split seventh scale degree, as shown below in an excerpt from &quot;O sacrum convivium&quot; by Thomas Tallis. The courtesy accidental on the tenor&#x27;s G is editorial.

=== Landini cadence ===
A Landini cadence (also known as a &quot;Landini sixth&quot;, &quot;Landini sixth cadence&quot;, or &quot;under-third cadence&quot;) is a cadence that was used extensively in the 14th and early 15th century. It is named after Francesco Landini, a composer who used them profusely. Similar to a clausula vera, it includes an escape tone in the upper voice, which briefly narrows the interval to a perfect fifth before the octave.

==Common practice period==
The classical and romantic periods of musical history provide many examples of the way the different cadences are used in context.

===Authentic cadences and half cadences===
Mozart’s Romanze from his Piano Concerto No. 20 follows a familiar pattern of a pair of phrases, one ending with a half (imperfect) cadence and the other with an authentic cadence:The presto movement from Beethoven’s String Quartet Op 130 follows the same pattern, but in a minor key:

===Plagal cadences===
The Hallelujah Chorus from Handel’s &quot;Messiah&quot; culminates powerfully with an iterated plagal cadence:Debussy’s prelude ‘La Fille aux Cheveux de Lin’ contains a plagal cadence in its 2nd and 3rd bars : One of the most famous endings in all music is found in the concluding bars of Wagner’s opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, where the dissonant chord in the opening phrase of the opera is finally resolved &quot;three enormous acts and five hours later&quot; in the form of a minor plagal cadence:

===Deceptive cadences===
In Bach&#x27;s harmonization of the chorale ‘Wachet auf’, a phrase ending in a deceptive cadence repeats with the cadence changed to an authentic one: The exposition of the first movement of Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 21 (The Waldstein Sonata), Op. 53 features a minor key passage where an authentic (perfect) cadence precedes a deceptive (interrupted) one:

Dvořák’s Slavonic Dance, Op. 72, No. 2 features deceptive (interrupted), half (imperfect) and authentic (perfect) cadences within its first sixteen bars:
Debussy&#x27;s Prelude “La fille aux cheveux de lin” (see also above) concludes with a passage featuring a deceptive (interrupted) cadence that progresses, not from V–VI, but from V–IV:
Some varieties of deceptive cadence that go beyond the usual V–VI pattern lead to some startling effects. For example, a particularly dramatic and abrupt deceptive cadence occurs in the second Presto movement of Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 30, Op. 109, bars 97–112, &quot;a striking passage that used to pre-occupy theorists&quot;. The music at this point is in B minor, and carries the expectation is that the chord of F sharp (Chord V) will be followed by the tonic chord of B. However, &quot;Dynamics become softer and softer; dominant and tonic chords of B minor appear isolated on the first beat of a bar, separated by silences: until in sudden fortissimo ... the recapitulation bursts on us in the tonic E minor, the B minor dominants left unresolved.&quot;
An equally startling example occurs in J.S. Bach&#x27;s Toccata and Fugue in F major, BWV 540:
According to Richard Taruskin, in this Toccata, &quot;the already much-delayed resolution is thwarted (m204) by what was the most spectacular &#x27;deceptive cadence&#x27; anyone had composed as of the second decade of the eighteenth century ... producing an especially pungent effect.&quot; Hermann Keller describes the effect of this cadence as follows: &quot;the splendour of the end with the famous third inversion of the seventh chord, who would not be enthralled by that?&quot;

Chopin&#x27;s Fantaisie, Op. 49, composed over a century later in 1841, features a similar harmonic jolt:
A deceptive cadence is a useful means for extending a musical narrative. In the closing passage of Bach’s Prelude in F minor from Book II of the &quot;Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;, the opening theme returns and seems headed towards a possible final resolution on an authentic (perfect) cadence. What the listener may expect is:
Instead, at bar 60, Bach inserts a deceptive cadence (V–VI in F minor), leading to a lengthy digression of some dozen bars before reaching resolution on the final (V–I) cadence.
A similar passage occurs at the conclusion of Mozart&#x27;s Fantasia in D minor, K397:

==Jazz==
Cadences in jazz are usually simply called cadences, as in common practice harmony. However, a certain category of cadence is referred to as a &quot;turnaround&quot; (originally called a &quot;turnback&quot; which is more accurate); this is when a cadence functions as a return to an already existing part of a song form such as AABA. In an AABA form, there are two turnbacks: at the end of the first A (A1) in order to repeat it (A2), and at the end of the B section in order to play the A a third time (A3). (The transition from the second A to the B is not a turnback, because the B section is being heard for the first time.)

Half-step cadences are common in jazz if not cliché. For example, the ascending diminished seventh chord half-step cadence, which—using a secondary diminished seventh chord—creates momentum between two chords a major second apart (with the diminished seventh in between).

The descending diminished seventh chord half-step cadence is assisted by two common tones.

==Rhythmic cadence==
Cadences often include (and may be emphasized or signalled by) a change in the prevailing rhythmic pattern; in such cases the final note of the cadence usually takes more time (a longer note value, or followed by a rest, or both), and within a piece of music the cadences may also share a rhythmic pattern that is characteristic of the cadences in that piece. This method of ending a phrase with some distinctive rhythmic pattern has been called a &quot;rhythmic cadence&quot;; rhythmic cadences continue to function without harmony or melody, for example at the ends of phrases in music for drums. Some styles of music rely on frequent regular rhythmic cadences as a unifying feature of that style. The example below shows a characteristic rhythmic cadence (i.e. many of the cadences in this piece share this rhythmic pattern) at the end of the first phrase (in particular the last two notes and the following rest, contrasted with the regular pattern set up by all the notes before them) of J.S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;Brandenburg Concerto&quot; No. 3 in G major, BMV 1048, mvmt. I, mm. 1–2:

<text>Chen Kaige (; born 12 August 1952) is a Chinese filmmaker. A leading figure of the fifth generation of Chinese directors, Chen is known for his visual flair and epic storytelling. Chen won the Palme d&#x27;Or at 1993 Cannes Film Festival and the International Federation of Film Critics (FIPRESCI) Award in 1993 for directing &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;.

==Early life==
Chen Kaige was born in Beijing, China into a family of Changle, Fuzhou origin, and grew up with fellow Fifth Generation alumnus Tian Zhuangzhuang as a childhood friend. His father was a well-known director in his own right. His mother Liu Yanchi () was a senior screenwriter. During the Cultural Revolution, Chen joined the Red Guards. As a teenage member of the Red Guards, Chen, like many other youths, denounced his own father, a fateful decision he eventually learned to regret. Indeed, this period of his life continues to influence much of his work today, notably in the unblinking depictions of the Cultural Revolution in &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;, and in the father-son relationship in &quot;Together&quot;. In 1969, Chen became a sent-down youth in Xishuangbanna Agricultural Reclamation Bureau for a short while before enlisting in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) next year. In 1975, Chen was discharged from the army and returned to Beijing, where he worked as a worker in Beijing Film Printing Factory. In 1978 Chen joined the Beijing Film Academy, where he graduated in 1982 as part of the so-called Fifth Generation of Chinese filmmakers.

==Career==
Upon graduating, Chen was assigned to the Guangxi Film Studio, along with a fellow graduate, Zhang Yimou. His first movie, &quot;Yellow Earth&quot; (1984), established itself as one of the most important works of Fifth Generation filmmaking; though simple, its powerful visual imagery (courtesy of cinematography by Zhang) and revolutionary storytelling style marked a sea change in how films were seen and perceived in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The film is unique in terms of concept, structure, and style, in line with the &quot;cultural roots seeking&quot; trend that emerged in China in the 1980s. The purpose of filming this film is to attempt to explore the deep cultural heritage of national history and spirit from a cultural perspective.&quot;The Big Parade&quot; (1986) and &quot;King of the Children&quot; (1987) expanded on his filmic repertoire. In 1987, he was awarded a fellowship by the Asian Cultural Council and served as a visiting scholar at the New York University Film School. Early in 1989, he did further experimenting in a music video for the song &quot;Do You Believe in Shame?&quot; by Duran Duran. Later that year, he made &quot;Life on a String&quot;, a highly esoteric movie which uses mythical allegory and lush scenery to tell the story of a blind sanxian musician and his student. In the same year, he was a member of the jury at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival.

His most famous film in the West, &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; (1993), nominated for two Academy Awards and winner of the Palme d&#x27;Or at 1993 Cannes Film Festival, follows two Beijing opera stars through decades of change in China during the twentieth century. This made him the first Chinese director to win the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Chen followed up the unprecedented success of &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; with &quot;Temptress Moon&quot; (1996), another period drama starring Leslie Cheung and Gong Li. Though it was well received by most critics, it did not achieve the accolades that &quot;Concubine&quot; did, and many were put off by the film&#x27;s convoluted plot line. Almost as famous is his &quot;The Emperor and the Assassin&quot; (1999), an epic involving the legendary King of Qin and the reluctant assassin who aims to kill him.

In 2002, Chen made his first, and to-date only, English-language film, &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot;, a thriller starring Heather Graham and Joseph Fiennes, though it proved to be both a critical and popular disappointment. This is also Chen Kaige&#x27;s first work to enter Hollywood, which he referred to as a &quot;secular, life&quot; film. His more recent &quot;Together&quot; (2002) is an intimate film about a young violinist and his father.It showcases the true desire of young people to grow according to their spiritual guidance, full of sensibility and warmth. &quot;Deep in Flowers&quot; is a collection of short films that opened the Cannes Film Festival in France in 2002. Chen Kaige was responsible for filming &quot;Ten Minutes, Aging&quot;, which is the finale of the series. The film selects a theme with strong Chinese and Beijing characteristics - demolition, and tells the story of the mentally ill &quot;Mr. Feng&quot; moving in a seemingly humorous tone. In 2005, he directed &quot;The Promise&quot;, a fantasy wuxia picture. &quot;The Promise&quot; saw Chen shifting to a more commercial mindset, a shift regarded by some as a &quot;radical stylistic turn&quot; from his previous works.

In 2006, he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 28th Moscow International Film Festival. In 2008, Chen directed the semi-biographical &quot;Forever Enthralled&quot;, which is a return for him in the sense of directing a film based on Chinese opera. He later went on to direct &quot;Sacrifice&quot; (2010), which is a re-imagining of the famous play &quot;The Orphan of Zhao&quot;. His 2012 film &quot;Caught in the Web&quot; was selected as the Chinese entry for the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist. His &quot;Monk Comes Down the Mountain&quot; (2015) is a critical bomb but a box office success. He then directed &quot;Legend of the Demon Cat&quot; (2017), a big-budget Chinese-Japanese co-production. The movie is adapted from the novel of the same name by Japanese fantasy novelist Mombasaur.

Since 2019, Chen directed or produced a series of propaganda films that are sometimes commissioned by the Chinese government, including co-directing &quot;The Battle at Lake Changjin&quot; (2021)&quot;,&quot; China&#x27;s highest-grossing film of all time.

Chen has also acted in several films, including Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; (1987) and his own &quot;The Emperor and the Assassin&quot; and &quot;Together&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Chen&#x27;s first wife was Sun Jialin (), whom he knew while working at the Beijing Film Factory from 1975 to 1978; they married in 1983 and divorced three years later. His second wife was Hong Huang, daughter of Zhang Hanzhi, a diplomat and English teacher of Mao Zedong. They separated in 1991 and divorced in 1993. From 1991, Chen lived with Ni Ping, a television personality, in a six-year relationship. In 1996, Chen married actress Chen Hong. They have two sons, Chen Yu&#x27;ang and &quot;Arthur&quot; Chen Feiyu.

Chen Kaige is a holder of green card to the United States.

<doc id="411314" wikidata="Q1040161" url="?curid=411314" title="Ames Brothers">
<text>The Ames Brothers were an American singing quartet, consisting of four siblings from Malden, Massachusetts, who were particularly famous in the 1950s for their traditional pop hits.

==Biography==
The Urick brothers were born in Malden, Massachusetts. Joe (May 3, 1921 – December 22, 2007), Gene (February 13, 1924 – April 26, 1997), Vic (May 20, 1925 – January 23, 1978), and Ed (July 9, 1927 – May 21, 2023) formed the singing group the Amory Brothers, which would become the Ames Brothers.

Born into a non-professional but musically talented family, the boys were raised to enjoy classical music and operatic music. Their parents, David and Sarah Urick, were Russian Jewish immigrants from Ukraine who read Shakespeare and semi-classics to their nine children from the time they were old enough to listen.

Three of the brothers formed a quartet with a cousin named Lennie, and had been touring United States Army and Navy bases entertaining the troops when they were offered a job at The Fox and Hounds nightclub, one of the fanciest clubs in Boston. This one-week engagement turned into several months when positive word-of-mouth about their appearance got around. At the time, they were using Vic&#x27;s middle name and calling themselves the Amory Brothers. They were becoming quite popular in the area and it was at this time that Joe decided to rejoin the group. Taking their act to New York City, they got a job with bandleader Art Mooney. One day while at Leeds Publishing Company in search of a song called &quot;Should I&quot; that their mother had asked them to sing, Milt Gabler of Decca Records overheard them singing it and asked them to cut a few sides for Decca Records, just before the AFM recording ban which James Petrillo imposed in January 1948. The ban was lifted a year later. The brothers shortened Amory to Ames and became the first artists to record for the newly founded Coral Records, a subsidiary of Decca.

The group sang on Robert Q. Lewis&#x27;s radio program until it was cut from one hour to 15 minutes. In late February 1949 they began performing on &quot;Sing It Again&quot;, a musical quiz program on CBS radio.

The brothers were swept into national top billing with their first hit record, &quot;Rag Mop&quot;, in January 1950. Doing radio shows for free at times, just for the experience, they later became regulars on such shows as &quot;Arthur Godfrey and His Friends&quot;. One of the first acts to appear on the original &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; when it was known as &quot;Toast of the Town&quot;, the foursome made their debut with him when the show was telecast live from Wanamaker&#x27;s Department Store.

Soon, the Ames Brothers were the top paid group in nightclubs and supper clubs everywhere and their popularity on television was nationwide. In 1956, they starred in their own syndicated TV program, &quot;The Ames Brothers Show&quot;, sponsored by RC Cola and broadcast on Friday nights. It was the first syndicated TV show to be broadcast in foreign countries. The brothers also appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom.&quot;

Over their fifteen-year career, the Ames Brothers prolific work notched up 49 US chart entries, 21 of them on the Coral label before signing with RCA Victor in 1953. The quartet disbanded in 1963, but Ed Ames continued with a successful singing and acting career, including playing Daniel Boone&#x27;s sidekick, Mingo, on the popular &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; television series.

==Legacy==
They were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1998.

==After disbanding==
Vic died in a car accident in 1978 at age 52, Gene died of cancer in 1997 at age 73, and Joe died of a heart attack in 2007 at age 86. Ed, the last surviving member, died in 2023 at the age of 95.

<text>Economic sanctions or embargoes are commercial and financial penalties applied by states or institutions against states, groups, or individuals. Economic sanctions are a form of coercion that attempts to get an actor to change its behavior through disruption in economic exchange. Sanctions can be intended to compel (an attempt to change an actor&#x27;s behavior) or deterrence (an attempt to stop an actor from certain actions).

Sanctions can target an entire country or they can be more narrowly targeted at individuals or groups; this latter form of sanctions are sometimes called &quot;smart sanctions&quot;. Prominent forms of economic sanctions include trade barriers, asset freezes, travel bans, arms embargoes, and restrictions on financial transactions.

The efficacy of sanctions in achieving intended goals is a subject of debate. Scholars have also considered the policy externalities of sanctions. The humanitarian consequences of country-wide sanctions have been a subject of controversy. As a consequence, since the mid-1990s, United Nations Security Council (UNSC) sanctions have tended to target individuals and entities, in contrast to the country-wide sanctions of earlier decades.

== History of sanctions ==
One of the most comprehensive attempts at an embargo occurred during the Napoleonic Wars of 1803–1815. Aiming to cripple the United Kingdom economically, Emperor Napoleon I of France in 1806 promulgated the Continental System—which forbade European nations from trading with the UK. In practice the French Empire could not completely enforce the embargo, which proved as harmful (if not more so) to the continental nations involved as to the British. By the time of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, diplomats and legal scholars regularly discussed using coordinated economic pressure to enforce international law. This idea was also included in reform proposals by Latin American and Chinese international lawyers in the years leading up to World War I.

=== World War I and the Interwar period ===
Sanctions in the form of blockades were prominent during World War I. Debates about implementing sanctions through international organizations, such as the League of Nations, became prominent after the end of World War I. Leaders saw sanctions as a viable alternative to war.

The League Covenant permitted the use of sanctions in five cases:

# When Article 10 of the League Covenant is violated
# In case of war or threat of war (Article 11)
# When a League member does not pay an arbitration award (Article 12)
# When a League member goes to war without submitting the dispute to the League Council or League Assembly (Articles 12–15)
# When a non-member goes to war against a League member (Article 17)

The Abyssinia Crisis in 1935 resulted in League sanctions against Mussolini&#x27;s Italy under Article 16 of the Covenant. Oil supplies, however, were not stopped, nor the Suez Canal closed to Italy, and the conquest proceeded. The sanctions were lifted in 1936 and Italy left the League in 1937.

In the lead-up to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the United States imposed severe trade restrictions on Japan to discourage further Japanese conquests in East Asia.

=== From World War II onwards ===
After World War II, the League was replaced by the more expansive United Nations (UN) in 1945. Throughout the Cold War, the use of sanctions increased gradually. After the end of the Cold War, there was a major increase in economic sanctions.

According to the Global Sanctions Data Base, there have been 1,325 sanctions in the period 1950–2022.

== Politics of sanctions ==
Economic sanctions are used as a tool of foreign policy by many governments. Economic sanctions are usually imposed by a larger country upon a smaller country for one of two reasons: either the latter is a perceived threat to the security of the former nation or that country treats its citizens unfairly. They can be used as a coercive measure for achieving particular policy goals related to trade or for humanitarian violations. Economic sanctions are used as an alternative weapon instead of going to war to achieve desired outcomes.

The Global Sanctions Data Base categorizes nine objectives of sanctions: &quot;changing policy, destabilizing regimes, resolving territorial conflicts, fighting terrorism, preventing war, ending war, restoring and promoting human rights, restoring and promoting democracy, and other objectives.&quot;

===Effectiveness of economic sanctions===
According to a study by Neuenkirch and Neumeier, UN economic sanctions had a statistically significant impact on targeted states by reducing their GDP growth by an average of 2.3–3.5% per year—and more than 5% per year in the case of comprehensive UN embargoes—with the negative effects typically persisting for a period of ten years. By contrast, unilateral US sanctions had a considerably smaller impact on GDP growth, restricting it by 0.5–0.9% per year, with an average duration of seven years.

Oryoie, A. R. demonstrates that economic sanctions result in welfare losses across all income groups in Iran, with wealthier groups suffering greater losses compared to poorer groups.

Imposing sanctions on an opponent also affects the economy of the imposing country to a degree. If import restrictions are promulgated, consumers in the imposing country may have restricted choices of goods. If export restrictions are imposed or if sanctions prohibit companies in the imposing country from trading with the target country, the imposing country may lose markets and investment opportunities to competing countries.

Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliot (2008) argue that regime change is the most frequent foreign-policy objective of economic sanctions, accounting for just over 39 percent of cases of their imposition. Hufbauer et al. found that 34 percent of the cases studied were successful. However, when Robert A. Pape examined their study, he found that only 5 of their reported 40 successes were actually effective, reducing the success rate to 4%. In either case, the difficulty and unexpected nuances of measuring the actual success of sanctions in relation to their goals are both increasingly apparent and still under debate. In other words, it is difficult to determine &quot;why&quot; a regime or country changes (i.e., whether it was the sanction or inherent instability) and doubly so to measure the full political effect of a given action.

Offering an explanation as to why sanctions are still imposed even when they may be marginally effective, British diplomat Jeremy Greenstock suggests sanctions are popular not because they are known to be effective, but because &quot;there is nothing else [to do] between words and military action if you want to bring pressure upon a government&quot;. Critics of sanctions like Belgian jurist Marc Bossuyt argue that in nondemocratic regimes, the extent to which this affects political outcomes is contested, because by definition such regimes do not respond as strongly to the popular will.

A strong connection has been found between the effectiveness of sanctions and the size of veto players in a government. Veto players represent individual or collective actors whose agreement is required for a change of the status quo, for example, parties in a coalition, or the legislature&#x27;s check on presidential powers. When sanctions are imposed on a country, it can try to mitigate them by adjusting its economic policy. The size of the veto players determines how many constraints the government will face when trying to change status quo policies, and the larger the size of the veto players, the more difficult it is to find support for new policies, thus making the sanctions more effective.

Francesco Giumelli writes that the &quot;set of sanctions ... that many observers would be likely to consider the most persuasive (and effective)&quot;, namely, UN sanctions against &quot;central bank assets and sovereign wealth funds&quot;, are &quot;of all the types of measures applied ... the one least frequently used&quot;. Giumelli also distinguishes between sanctions against international terrorists, in which &quot;the nature of the request is not as important as the constraining aspect&quot;, and sanctions imposed in connection with &quot;post-conflict scenarios&quot;, which should &quot;include flexible demands and the potential for adaptation if the situation changes&quot;.

Economic sanctions can be used for achieving domestic and international purposes.

Foreign aid suspensions are typically considered as a type of economic sanctions. Previously mentioned work by Hufbauer, Schott, Elliot, and Oegg is a prominent example. Claas Mertens finds that &quot;suspending aid is more effective than adopting economic sanctions because (1) aid suspensions are economically beneficial for the adopting state, while sanctions are costly, (2) aid suspensions directly affect the targeted government&#x27;s budget, (3) market forces undermine sanctions but not aid suspensions, and (4) aid suspensions are less likely to spark adverse behavioral reactions. [...] The findings suggest that economic sanctions are less effective than previously thought and that large donor states have a higher chance of achieving political goals through economic coercion.&quot;

===Criticism===
Sanctions have been criticized on humanitarian grounds, as they negatively impact a nation&#x27;s economy and can also cause collateral damage on ordinary citizens. Peksen implies that sanctions can degenerate human rights in the target country. Some policy analysts believe that imposing trade restrictions only serves to hurt ordinary people as opposed to government elites, and others have likened the practice to siege warfare. The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has generally refrained from imposing comprehensive sanctions since the mid-1990s, in part due to the controversy over the efficacy and civilian harms attributed to the sanctions against Iraq.

Sanctions can have unintended consequences.

=== Smart Sanctions ===
One of the most popular suggestions to combat the humanitarian issues that arise from sanctions is the concept of &quot;smart sanctions&quot;, and a lot of research has been done on this concept also known as targeted sanctions. The term &quot;smart sanctions&quot; refers to measures like asset freezes, travel bans, and arms embargoes that aim to target responsible parties like political leaders and elites with the goal of avoiding causing widespread collateral damage to innocent civilians and neighboring nations.

Though there has been enthusiasm about the concept, as of 2016, the Targeted Sanctions Consortium (TSC) found that targeted sanctions only result in policy goals being met 22% of the time.

Smart Sanctions have also not been totally successful in avoiding civilian harm or unintended consequences. For example, arms embargoes can impact the self-defense efforts of those under attack, aviation bans can affect a nation&#x27;s transportation sector and the jobs of civilians associated with them, and financial sanctions targeting individuals raise due process issues. One example of smart sanctions in practice can be seen with sanctions imposed by the United States on the Russian Federation following the latter&#x27;s 2014 annexation of Crimea, which were intended to exert pressure on Russia&#x27;s financial sector. The sanctions resulted in American credit card companies Visa and MasterCard suspending all transactions of sanctioned Russian banks, effectively canceling the credit cards of ordinary Russian consumers.

==Implications for businesses==
There is an importance, especially with relation to financial loss, for companies to be aware of embargoes that apply to their intended export or import destinations. Properly preparing products for trade, sometimes referred to as an embargo check, is a difficult and timely process for both importers and exporters.

There are many steps that must be taken to ensure that a business entity does not accrue unwanted fines, taxes, or other punitive measures. Common examples of embargo checks include referencing embargo lists, cancelling transactions, and ensuring the validity of a trade entity.

This process can become very complicated, especially for countries with changing embargoes. Before better tools became available, many companies relied on spreadsheets and manual processes to keep track of compliance issues. Today, there are software based solutions that automatically handle sanctions and other complications with trade.

==Examples==
===United States sanctions===
====US Embargo Act of 1807====

The United States Embargo of 1807 involved a series of laws passed by the US Congress (1806–1808) during the second term of President Thomas Jefferson. Britain and France were engaged in the War of the Fourth Coalition; the US wanted to remain neutral and to trade with both sides, but both countries objected to American trade with the other. American policy aimed to use the new laws to avoid war and to force both France and Britain to respect American rights. The embargo failed to achieve its aims, and Jefferson repealed the legislation in March 1809.

====US embargo of Cuba====

The United States embargo against Cuba began on March 14, 1958, during the overthrow of dictator Fulgencio Batista by Fidel Castro during the Cuban Revolution. At first, the embargo applied only to arms sales; however, it later expanded to include other imports, eventually extending to almost all trade on February 7, 1962. Referred to by Cuba as &quot;el bloqueo&quot; (the blockade), the US embargo on Cuba remains one of the longest-standing embargoes in modern history. Few of the United States&#x27; allies embraced the embargo, and many have argued it has been ineffective in changing Cuban government behavior. While taking some steps to allow limited economic exchanges with Cuba, American President Barack Obama nevertheless reaffirmed the policy in 2011, stating that without the granting of improved human rights and freedoms by Cuba&#x27;s current government, the embargo remains &quot;in the national interest of the United States&quot;.

==== Other countries ====
=== Russian sanctions ===
Russia has been known to utilize economic sanctions to achieve its political goals. Russia&#x27;s focus has been primarily on implementing sanctions against the pro-Western governments of former Soviet Union states. The Kremlin&#x27;s aim is particularly on states that aspire to join the European Union and NATO, such as Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia. Russia has enacted a law, the Dima Yakovlev Law, that defines sanctions against US citizens involved in &quot;violations of the human rights and freedoms of Russian citizens&quot;. It lists US citizens who are banned from entering Russia.

==== Russia sanctions on Ukraine ====

Viktor Yushchenko, the third president of Ukraine who was elected in 2003, lobbied during his term to gain admission to NATO and the EU. Soon after Yushchenko entered office, Russia demanded Kyiv pay the same rate that it charged Western European states. This quadrupled Ukraine&#x27;s energy bill overnight. Russia subsequently cut off the supply of natural gas in 2006, causing significant harm to the Ukrainian and Russian economies. As the Ukrainian economy began to struggle, Yushchenko&#x27;s approval ratings dropped significantly; reaching the single digits by the 2010 election; Viktor Yanukovych, who was more supportive of Moscow won the election in 2010 to become the fourth president of Ukraine. After his election, gas prices were reduced substantially.

==== Russian sanctions on Georgia ====
The Rose Revolution in Georgia brought Mikheil Saakashvili to power as the third president of the country. Saakashvili wanted to bring Georgia into NATO and the EU and was a strong supporter of the US-led war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Russia would soon implement a number of different sanctions on Georgia, including natural gas price raises through Gazprom and wider trade sanctions that impacted the Georgian economy, particularly Georgian exports of wine, citrus fruits, and mineral water. In 2006, Russia banned all imports from Georgia which was able to deal a significant blow to the Georgian economy. Russia also expelled nearly 2,300 Georgians who worked within its borders.

===United Nations sanctions===
The United Nations issues sanctions by consent of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and/or General Assembly in response to major international events, receiving authority to do so under Article 41 of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. The nature of these sanctions may vary, and include financial, trade, or weaponry restrictions. Motivations can also vary, ranging from humanitarian and environmental concerns to efforts to halt nuclear proliferation. Over two dozen sanctions measures have been implemented by the United Nations since its founding in 1945.

Most UNSC sanctions since the mid-1990s have targeted individuals and entities rather than entire governments, a change from the comprehensive trade sanctions of earlier decades. For example, the UNSC maintains lists of individuals indicted for crimes or linked to international terrorism, which raises novel legal questions regarding due process. According to a dataset covering the years 1991 to 2013, 95% of UNSC sanction regimes included &quot;sectoral bans&quot; on aviation and/or the import (or export) of arms or raw materials, 75% included &quot;individual/group&quot; sanctions such as asset freezes or restrictions on travel, and just 10% targeted national finances or included measures against central banks, sovereign wealth funds, or foreign investment. The most frequently used UNSC sanction documented in the dataset is an embargo against imported weapons, which applied in 87% of all cases and was directed against non-state actors more often than against governments. Targeted sanctions regimes may contain hundreds of names, a handful, or none at all.

==== Sanctions on Somalia, 1992 ====

The UN implemented sanctions against Somalia beginning in April 1992, after the overthrow of the Siad Barre regime in 1991 during the Somali Civil War. UNSC Resolution 751 forbade members to sell, finance, or transfer any military equipment to Somalia.

==== Sanctions on North Korea, 2006 ====

The UNSC passed Resolution 1718 in 2006 in response to a nuclear test that the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) conducted in violation of the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The resolution banned the sale of military and luxury goods and froze government assets. Since then, the UN has passed multiple resolutions subsequently expanding sanctions on North Korea. Resolution 2270 from 2016 placed restrictions on transport personnel and vehicles employed by North Korea while also restricting the sale of natural resources and fuel for aircraft.

The efficacy of such sanctions has been questioned in light of continued nuclear tests by North Korea in the decade following the 2006 resolution. Professor William Brown of Georgetown University argued that &quot;sanctions don&#x27;t have much of an impact on an economy that has been essentially bankrupt for a generation&quot;.

==== Sanctions on Libya ====
On February 26, 2011, the UNSC issued an arms embargo against the Libya through Security Council Resolution 1970 in response to humanitarian abuses occurring in the First Libyan Civil War. The embargo was later extended to mid-2018. Under the embargo, Libya has suffered severe inflation because of increased dependence on the private sector to import goods. The sanctions caused large cuts to health and education, which caused social conditions to decrease. Even though the sanctions were in response to human rights, their effects were limited.

=== Sanction on the Central African Republic ===

In 2013 the UN decreed an arms embargo against the CAR. The arms embargo was established in the context of an intercommunity conflict between the Séléka rebels, with a Muslim majority, and the predominantly Christian militias. to fight back. Raised UN Security Council lifts arms embargo on CAR on August 1, 2024.

====Sanctions on apartheid South Africa====

In effort to punish South Africa for its policies of apartheid, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a voluntary international oil-embargo against South Africa on November 20, 1987; that embargo had the support of 130 countries. South Africa, in response, expanded its Sasol production of synthetic crude.

All United Nations sanctions on South Africa ended over the Negotiations to end Apartheid, Resolution 919 and the 1994 South African elections, in which Nelson Mandela was elected as the first post-Apartheid president. When asked in 1993 if economic sanctions had helped end apartheid, Mandela replied &quot;Oh, there is no doubt.&quot;

===Other multilateral sanctions===
The United States, Britain, the Republic of China and the Netherlands imposed sanctions against Japan in 1940–1941 in response to its expansionism. Deprived of access to vital oil, iron-ore and steel supplies, Japan started planning for military action to seize the resource-rich Dutch East Indies, which required a preemptive attack on Pearl Harbor, triggering the American entry into the Pacific War.

In 1973–1974, OAPEC instigated the 1973 oil crisis through its oil embargo against the United States and other industrialized nations that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War. The results included a sharp rise in oil prices and in OPEC revenues, an emergency period of energy rationing, a global economic recession, large-scale conservation efforts, and long-lasting shifts toward natural gas, ethanol, nuclear and other alternative energy sources. Israel continued to receive Western support, however.

In 2010, the European Union made the decision to sanction Iran due to their involvement in their nuclear program. Theresa Papademetriou states the exact restrictions the EU posed on Iran, &quot;prohibition on the provision of insurance, increased restrictions on and notifications needed for transfers of funds to and from Iran, restrictions on the supply of or traffic in technology and equipment to be used in certain oil and gas fields and prohibition of investment in such fields, expansion of the list of goods and technology whose supply to Iran is either subject to prior authorization or is completely banned and new visa restrictions.” Also in 2010, the UN Council imposed sanctions on Iran due to their involvement in their nuclear program. These sanctions banned Iran from carrying out tests on their nuclear weapons and imposed an embargo on the transfer of weapons into the country. These sanctions resulted in drastic macroeconomic downturns for the Iranian economy including volatility in GDP, increase in unemployment, and increase in inflation.

==Current sanctions==
===By targeted country===

**European Union arms embargo on the People&#x27;s Republic of China
** Hong Kong, enacted in response to the National Security Law
*Cuban embargoes by the US. It covers arms, consumer goods and financial assets, enacted in 1958
*EU, US, Australia, Canada and Norway by Russia since August 2014 on beef, pork, fruit and vegetable produce, poultry, fish, cheese, milk and dairy items. On August 13, 2015, the embargo was expanded to include Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, and Liechtenstein

Enacted 1979, increased through the following years and reached its tightest point in 2010. In April 2019 the US threatened to sanction countries that continued to buy oil from Iran after an initial six-month waiver announced in November 2018 had expired. According to the BBC, US sanctions against Iran &quot;have led to a sharp downturn in Iran&#x27;s economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, quadrupling its annual inflation rate, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests&quot;. These sanctions have taken a toll on humanitarian concerns.
* Mali by the UNSC in relation to the spiraling security situation and hostilities in breach of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in 2017

An arms embargo and the selling of assets were banned due to human rights violations, high government corruption, links with drug cartels and electoral rigging in the 2018 Venezuelan presidential elections. Sanctions imposed by Canada since 2017, and since 2018 by Mexico, Panama and Switzerland

===By targeted individuals===
* List of individuals sanctioned during the Venezuelan crisis
* List of people and organizations sanctioned during the Russo-Ukrainian War
* List of people and organizations sanctioned in relation to human rights violations in Belarus
* United Nations sanction imposed by UN Security Council Resolution 1267 in 1999 against all Al-Qaida- and Taliban-associated individuals. The cornerstone of the sanction is a consolidated list of persons maintained by the Security Council. All nations are obliged to freeze bank accounts and other financial instruments controlled by or used for the benefit of anyone on the list.

===By sanctioning country or organization===
* Australia currently sanctions 9 countries
* Chinese sanctions
* India sanctions
* United Kingdom currently has sanctions on 27 countries
* United Nations has since 1966 established 30 sanctions regimes to countries (such as Southern Rhodesia, South Africa, Yugoslavia and more) and to organizations (such as ISIL, al-Qaida and the Taliban)
* United States sanctions and United States embargoes
** 2002 United States steel tariff was placed by the United States on steel to protect its industry from foreign producers such as China and Russia. The World Trade Organization ruled that the tariffs were illegal. The European Union threatened retaliatory tariffs on a range of US goods that would mainly affect swing states. The US government then removed the steel tariffs in early 2004.

===By targeted activity===
* In response to cyber-attacks on April 1, 2015, President Obama issued an Executive Order establishing the first-ever economic sanctions. The Executive Order was intended to impact individuals and entities (&quot;designees&quot;) responsible for cyber-attacks that threaten the national security, foreign policy, economic health, or financial stability of the US. Specifically, the Executive Order authorized the Treasury Department to freeze designees— assets. The European Union implemented their first targeted financial sanctions regarding cyber activity in 2020.
* In response to intelligence analysis alleging Russian hacking and interference with the 2016 US elections, President Obama expanded presidential authority to sanction in response to cyber activity that threatens democratic elections. Given that the original order was intended to protect critical infrastructure, it can be argued that the election process should have been included in the original order.

===Bilateral trade disputes===
* Vietnam as a result of capitalist influences over the 1990s and having imposed sanctions against Cambodia, is accepting of sanctions disposed with accountability.
* Brazil introduced sanctions against the US in March 2010. These sanctions were placed because the US government was paying cotton farmers for their products against World Trade Organization rules. The sanctions cover cotton, as well as cars, chewing gum, fruit, and vegetable products. The WTO is currently supervising talks between the states to remove the sanctions.

As a result, the dollar is the currency that many companies must use... to do international business.&quot; (p. 150.) &quot;[L]ocal banks facilitating that trade... normally... buy U.S. dollars and then use dollars to buy [another local currency]. To do so, however, the banks must have access to the U.S. financial system and... follow rules laid out by Washington.&quot; (pp. 151–152.) &quot;But there is another, lesser-known reason why the [U.S.] commands overwhelming economic power. Most of the world&#x27;s fiber-optic cables, which carry data and messages around the planet, travel through the United States.&quot; (p. 152.) &quot;[T]he U.S. government has installed &#x27;splitters&#x27;: prisms that divide the beams of light carrying information into two streams. One... goes on to the intended recipients, ... the other goes to the National Security Agency, which then uses high-powered computation to analyze the data. As a result, the [U.S.] can monitor almost all international communication.&quot; (p. 154) This has allowed the U.S. &quot;to effectively cut Iran out of the world financial system... Iran&#x27;s economy stagnated... Eventually, Tehran agreed to cut back its nuclear programs in exchange for relief.&quot; (pp. 153–154.) &quot;[A] few years ago, American officials... were in a panic about [the Chinese company] Huawei... which... seemed poised to supply 5G equipment to much of the planet [thereby possibly] giv[ing] China the power to eavesdrop on the rest of the world – just as the [U.S.] has done... The [U.S.] learned that Huawei had been dealing surreptitiously with Iran – and therefore violating U.S. sanctions. Then, it... used its special access to information on international bank data to [show] that [Huawei]&#x27;s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou (... the founder&#x27;s daughter), had committed bank fraud by falsely telling the British financial services company HSBC that her company was not doing business with Iran. Canadian authorities, acting on a U.S. request, arrested her... in December 2018. After... almost three years under house arrest... Meng... was allowed to return to China... But by [then] the prospects for Chinese dominance of 5G had vanished...&quot; (pp. 154–155.) Farrell and Newman, writes Krugman, &quot;are worried about the possibility of [U.S. &quot;Underground Empire&quot;] overreach. [I]f the [U.S.] weaponizes the dollar against too many countries, they might... band together and adopt alternative methods of international payment. If countries become deeply worried about U.S. spying, they could lay fiber-optic cables that bypass the [U.S.]. And if Washington puts too many restrictions on American exports, foreign firms might turn away from U.S. technology.&quot; (p. 155.)

For large parts of the world that moment will be cause for celebration.&quot; (p. 29.)

<doc id="411316" wikidata="Q979079" url="?curid=411316" title="Catholic Church in Mexico">
<text>The Mexican Catholic Church, or Catholic Church in Mexico, is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope, his Curia in Rome, and the national Mexican Episcopal Conference. According to the Mexican census, Roman Catholicism is the dominant religion in Mexico, practiced by 77.7 percent of the population in 2020. A Statistica survey suggests this number could be a little lower, suggesting Catholics could make up 72 percent of the nation.

The history of the Catholic Church in Mexico dates from the period of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire (1519–1521) and it has continued as an institution in Mexico into the twenty-first century. In the late 20th century, Eastern Catholic jurisdictions were also established in Mexico.

In many parts of the country, Catholic Christianity is heavily syncretized with folk customs; and Aztec, Mayan, and other pre-Columban religions.

== History ==

The history of the Catholic Church in Mexico can be divided into distinct periods, the basic division being between colonial Mexico, known as New Spain and the national period, from Mexican independence in 1821 until the current era.

The era of the military conquest in the early sixteenth century saw the Church&#x27;s huge effort to evangelize the indigenous population of Mexico in what is termed &quot;the spiritual conquest&quot;. As the Spanish Empire expanded into new territories, the incorporation of the indigenous population was a priority for the crown. The growth of the Spanish and mixed-race urban population of Mexico prompted the establishment of the episcopal hierarchy, under the patronage of the monarch and the creation of dioceses in Mexico.

In the national period, following independence in early nineteenth century, Mexico established a legal framework that continued the privileged status of the Catholic Church as official and unique religion. La Reforma of the late 1850s sparked an extended period of violent conflict between the conservative supporters of the old order and liberals who sought to displace and diminish the power of the Church. The Mexican Revolution was won by largely anticlerical Constitutionalists and the Church&#x27;s role in Mexico was restricted constitutionally.

After a period of violent open conflict over religious matters, Church-state relations returned to a modus vivendi while the anticlerical constitutional framework remained in place. Expansion of Catholic participation in the establishment of religious educational institutions and the creation of a conservative political party, the National Action Party, was an important characteristic of the late twentieth century. A new constitutional framework was created in 1992, which reiterated the separation between the Catholic Church and the state and lifted most but not all restrictions on religious freedom and the activities of the Catholic Church in Mexico.

==Organization of the Church in Modern Mexico==




The Catholic Church is the world&#x27;s largest Christian church, and its largest religious grouping. The 2020 census reported that Mexico had some 97,864,220 Catholics, which equates to approximately 78% of the total population, making it the second largest Catholic country in the world after Brazil. The country is divided into 18 Ecclesiastical provinces, containing a total of 90 dioceses. There are 15,700 diocesan priests and 46,000 men and women in religious orders.

José Garibi y Rivera was the first Mexican cardinal of the Catholic Church. Javier Lozano Barragán having served 10 years as a cardinal-deacon, was promoted to Cardinal Priest of Santa Dorotea by Pope Francis on 12 June 2014. Pope Francis selected 15 new cardinals for the Church in January 2015, one of whom was for Mexico in the archdiocese of Morelia. Alberto Suárez Inda is Morelia&#x27;s first cardinal. According to an Associated Press story, he &quot;has helped mediate political conflicts and kidnappings in one of Mexico&#x27;s most violence-plagued states&quot;. On 7 December 2017, Pope Francis named Cardinal Carlos Aguiar Retes Archbishop of Mexico to succeed Norberto Rivera Carrera, &quot;a pastor who had as many detractors as supporters&quot; after 22 years in the post. His installation was scheduled for 5 February 2018. &quot;The Tablet&quot; said the appointment was not a surprise because Aguiar is &quot;a towering ecclesial figure in Central and Latin America&quot;.

==Freedom of religion==
The constitution declares that Mexico is a secular state and provides for the right to religious freedom.

In the same year, the country was ranked as the 38th most difficult place in the world to be a Christian.

<text>The Queens Public Library (QPL), also known as the Queens Borough Public Library and Queens Library (QL), is the public library for the borough of Queens, and one of three public library systems serving New York City. It is one of the largest library systems in the world by circulation, having loaned 13.5 million items in the 2015 fiscal year, and one of the largest in the country in terms of the size of its collection. According to its website, the library holds about 7.5 million items, of which 1.4 million are at its central library in Jamaica, Queens. It was named &quot;2009 Library of the Year&quot; by &quot;Library Journal.&quot;

Although it was organized in 1858 on a subscription basis, the original Central Library on Parsons Boulevard in Jamaica was opened in 1930 and later expanded with a four-story Renaissance Revival themed architecture. Dating back to the foundation of the first Queens library in Flushing in 1858, Queens Public Library has become one of the largest public library systems in the United States, comprising 62 branches throughout the borough. Queens Public Library serves Queens&#x27; population of almost 2.3 million, including one of the largest immigrant populations in the country. Consequently, a large percentage of the library&#x27;s collections are in languages other than English, particularly Spanish, Chinese, Korean and Russian. Queens Public Library is separate from both the New York Public Library, which serves the Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island, and the Brooklyn Public Library, which serves only Brooklyn.

==History==

The first library in Queens was founded in 1858 in Flushing as a subscription service. It became a free circulation library in 1869.

In the late 19th century, several local libraries were founded in western Queens. The libraries in Astoria, Long Island City and Steinway formed the Long Island City Public Library in 1896, becoming Queens&#x27; first multi-branch library. In 1901, shortly after the consolidation of Queens into New York City, the city government proposed a new charter joining all libraries in Queens into the Queens Borough Public Library. All of the public libraries signed on, except for Flushing, which remained independent until 1903. The Queens Borough Public Library was officially incorporated in 1907.

Due to the wide variation in population density in Queens, in 1906, the Queens Borough Public Library established small branches in store-fronts and shopping areas under the Traveling Library program. With these branches, Queens Library grew swiftly, eventually opening major branches in almost every Queens neighborhood.

The original Central Library on Parsons Boulevard in Jamaica was opened in 1930 and expanded with Works Progress Administration funds in 1941. It was a splendid four-story Renaissance Revival building. In spite of its elegance, it was too small for the demand and was replaced by a new, more spacious facility in 1966, through the persistent efforts of the Library Director, Harold W. Tucker.

$240,000 donated by Andrew Carnegie was used for the construction of seven new Carnegie libraries between 1904 and 1924 in the most heavily populated areas of the borough. Four of these buildings (Astoria, Poppenhusen, Richmond Hill and Woodhaven) are still in use. They are characterized by their stately solidity and expensive decorative details. The Carnegie-era Flushing Branch was demolished for a more modern building in the 1950s, and the Far Rockaway Branch was destroyed by fire in 1962.

Library branches were added slowly as the borough&#x27;s population expanded. By 1946, Queens Borough Public Library had 44 branches plus the Central Library and a very active bookmobile.

Many additional branches had been approved to be built between 1954 and 1965, but were not completed due to a New York City fiscal crisis. Additional funds were given to the library system by the federal Library Services and Construction Act to finish the Central Library, Flushing and Far Rockaway branches. In the 1990s interest in completing the proposed branches was revived. In 1998, the new Queens Borough Public Library at Flushing was opened, and four other branches were opened between 1999 and 2007. The Queens Library was allocated more than $269 million in capital funds between fiscal years 2005 and 2013.

The Queens Borough Public Library was renamed the Queens Library sometime in the past. In April 2019, it was renamed again to Queens Public Library, with the new tagline &quot;We speak your language&quot;.

==Administration==
Queens Public Library is governed by a 19-member Board of Trustees, which are appointed by the mayor of New York City and the borough president of Queens. The mayor, speaker of the city council, borough president, the New York City comptroller and the New York public advocate sit on the board as &quot;ex officio&quot; members. The library is funded by the city, through state and federal grants, and through private philanthropy. Dennis Walcott was appointed president and CEO in March 2016.

==Branches==
Queens Public Library has 62 locations, seven Adult Learning Centers, two Family Literacy Centers, and a Mobile Library.

===Central Library===
Central Library was the first major branch of an urban library to place all public services on one floor. The library cost $5.7 million and contained of floor space. The library was renovated and expanded in 1989. Additional renovation and expansion was expected to be completed in 2013. A new Children&#x27;s Library Discovery Center, adjacent to the main library, was designed by 1100 Architect and opened in 2011.

Central Library includes resources that support education and research through the college level. A local history collection (The Archives at Queens Library) houses thousands of photographs, books and ephemera having to do with the history of Queens and the four counties of Long Island. Other special collections include job search/readiness information and training and consumer health information.

===Black Heritage Reference Center===
The Langston Hughes Library in Corona is home to the Black Heritage Reference Center, which contains materials &quot;written by, about, for, with and related to Black Culture.&quot; It is the largest collection of materials dedicated solely to Black culture in New York State.

==Archives at Queens Library==
The Archives at Queens Library, formerly known as the Long Island Division, is a special collection in the Central Library building that focuses on the history of Brooklyn, Queens, Nassau, and Suffolk counties. The Archives was first founded in 1912. It consists of books, publications, current and historical newspapers, family manuscripts and genealogical material, historical maps and atlases including Belcher Hyde and Sanborn Company maps, late 19th- and early 20th-century photographs, as well as other archival material.

<doc id="411322" wikidata="Q7809793" url="?curid=411322" title="Titania (DC Comics)">
<text>Titania is a fictional character, a comic book faerie published by DC Comics. She first appeared in &quot;The Sandman&quot; (vol. 2) #19 (September 1990), and was created by Neil Gaiman and Charles Vess. She is inspired by and implied to be the same as Titania as the faerie queen in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

==Publication history==
As part of his comic &quot;The Sandman&quot;, writer Neil Gaiman planned a small arc involving William Shakespeare entering a deal with the Dream King to write plays that would live on after him. Having introduced Shakespeare, Gaiman then decided to tell the story of the first play that the writer wrote for Dream in payment of the bargain. He turned to his favourite of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; creating analogs of the play&#x27;s main otherworldly characters and inventing the fiction that Shakespeare wrote the play to Dream&#x27;s instructions to ensure that humans never forgot Faerie and its rulers, Lord Auberon and Lady Titania. Having created her, Gaiman used Titania as a recurring character throughout the series, and when he was asked part way through his run on &quot;The Sandman&quot; to write a script to introduce DC&#x27;s magical characters to a new audience, he gave her a guest role in the resultant mini-series, &quot;The Books of Magic&quot;.

One ambiguous scene written by Gaiman was interpreted by some to suggest that Titania was the mother of protagonist Timothy Hunter, which ensured that the character would return when the mini-series became an ongoing series. Chosen as Gaiman&#x27;s replacement, John Ney Rieber discovered that a gaming guide to the DC universe had made this assumption, and worried that a key part of the Tim Hunter character - that he was a normal teenage boy - might be lost if this was true. Instead of simply denying the possibility of Titania being Tim&#x27;s mother Rieber decided to use the idea as one of his ongoing storylines, while gently debunking it. This meant utilizing Titania and her husband Auberon as supporting characters for most of his run on the comic, which in turn meant frequent visits and explorations to Faerie. Such was the importance of Titania to Rieber&#x27;s version of &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; that when its popularity caused DC to release a spin-off miniseries, they decided that a three-issue miniseries about her rise to power would be most suitable - one that reignited the possibility of her being Tim&#x27;s mother.

The character later returned for brief appearances in Dylan Horrocks&#x27; &quot;&quot; and Si Spencer&#x27;s &quot;Books of Magick: Life During Wartime&quot;, before author Mike Carey brought her back in the graphic novel &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;. The graphic novel also introduced the character of Queen Mab, a name which &quot;The Sandman&quot; had established that Titania sometimes used as an alias.

===Appearance===
In her first appearance, Titania was depicted as a regal woman who looked almost entirely human save for pointed ears. While her physical appearance remained consistent regardless of the artist depicting her during her time in &quot;The Sandman&quot;, her skin color varied from green back to normal human tones and then back to a consistent green whenever she appeared in &quot;The Books of Magic&quot;. &quot;The Books of Faerie&quot; established that Titania&#x27;s true appearance was constantly hidden by a magical glamour, which may explain her changing skin tone.

==Fictional character biography==
Titania was born a normal human girl called Maryrose living in poverty with her grandmother during the 11th century. When she was collecting wood in a nearby forest, she was tempted by a group of Flitlings to return with them to Faerie. Once there, she became a favorite of Queen Dymphna, earning the nickname Rosebud to protect her true name: she also caught the eye of King Obrey, who - spurred on by his jester, the manipulative Amadan - magically transformed his wife into a tree and took Maryrose as his second wife. Maryrose took a gemstone glamour from Dymphna and used it to appear a pure-blood faerie at her coronation, taking the name Queen Titania.

Titania seemed truly flattered by the love and attention of the king, but this was short-lived: Obrey was killed in battle by the rightful King of Faerie, Lord Auberon. Seeking to reunite the warring factions, Auberon took Titania as his wife when he reclaimed the throne, and urged her to quickly set about the work of producing an heir to make the union secure. Titania felt slighted by the loss of a loving husband and his replacement with one whose only interest in her appeared to be political, and soon began the first of many affairs with the human falconer Tamlin. Titania&#x27;s infidelity later became notorious - even one of her lesser subjects was able to comment on how fitting it was that Auberon wore horns - and she is rumoured to have had an affair with Dream of the Endless (called &quot;Lord Shaper&quot; by the faeries) and was seen casually bedding her female servant Selwyn - unaware that the maid was Auberon in disguise. Perhaps because of her infidelity, Titania was quick to assume that Auberon was equally unfaithful, although no evidence of this was ever shown, and conversely Auberon was shown to maintain strong affection for his wife even in the face of her reputation, even regularly disguising himself as a maid to be with his queen without enduring her scorn.

Titania was shown to be a jealous lover, demanding unconditional adoration from her lovers even though she rarely returned the feelings herself: her affair with Tamlin ended when he realised what she was truly like and she was noticeably annoyed when Dream sent no secret message for her with a servant who returned to Faerie from his realm. However, she has also shown genuine affection and emotion, even if she tries to hide it: when her affair with Tamlin leaves her with a human son, she is devastated to have to send him to Earth to keep the secret of her nature and her affair from the King and risks sending her realm to war against Hell to protect her son with Auberon from being kept in Hell as payment of Faerie&#x27;s tithe to the demons.

Titania was acutely aware of her status as queen, and the respect and attention she felt she was due because of it. She nearly destroyed her entire realm by cursing Molly O&#x27;Reilly to turn into the &quot;Burning Girl&quot; for no other reason than her attendants&#x27; fascination with the girl&#x27;s efforts to grow real vegetables, and frequently grew enraged at Timothy Hunter&#x27;s casual disregard for the possibility that she might be his mother. Rarely, she can show something like humility, for example apologising to Molly for the trouble she caused the girl and acknowledging that she had done wrong. Despite her faults, Titania was a strong and able queen, whether riding out to face down the forces of Hell at the head of her army or subtly politicking to ensure that Faerie&#x27;s best interests were met in the wider worlds.
