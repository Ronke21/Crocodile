A succession of well-received supporting parts followed, beginning with his portrayal of Michael Cheritto in the heist film &quot;Heat&quot; (1995).

In the early 2000s, he appeared in the action films &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (2001), which also starred Ben Affleck and Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; (2001). Sizemore had a voice role as Sonny Forelli in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;. He starred in &quot;Ticker&quot; (2001), an action film directed by Albert Pyun, with Steven Seagal and Dennis Hopper. Sizemore also starred in the well-reviewed but short-lived television drama series &quot;Robbery Homicide Division&quot; (2002-2003). He appeared in the Mel Gibson-produced &quot;Paparazzi&quot; (2004), played Pete Rose in Hustle (2004) depicting his illegal gambling while managing the Cincinnati Reds, and played an undercover cop in &quot;Swindle&quot; (2006), opposite Sherilyn Fenn.

The series also covered an ongoing legal appeal of his conviction for an assault of former Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss. In the same year, the actor starred in the indie drama film &quot;Oranges&quot; (2007) with Tom Arnold and Jill Hennessy, which was directed by Syrian director and producer Joseph Merhi.

Sizemore received positive notices for the drama thriller &quot;Calico Skies&quot; (2016). In 2017, he appeared as insurance agent Anthony Sinclair in David Lynch&#x27;s revival miniseries &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, and portrayed FBI Agent Bill Sullivan in the drama film &quot;Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House&quot;.

In January 2022, he joined the cast of &quot;The Legend of Jack and Diane&quot;, a feature film described as a female-fronted revenge thriller, directed and written by Bruce Bellocchi. Also in 2022, Sizemore starred in the comedy series &quot;Barbee Rehab&quot;, alongside Bai Ling and Janice Dickinson.

=== Music ===
Sizemore fronted the Hollywood rock band Day 8. Formed in 2002, the band recorded a four-song EP produced and recorded by Bradley Dujmovic and former Snot/Soulfly guitarist Mike Doling. Originally called &quot;The Bystanders&quot;, the group included guitarist and co-writer Rod Castro, Alan Muffterson, Tyrone Tomke, and Michael Taylor.

== Personal life ==
Sizemore married actress Maeve Quinlan in 1996. They divorced in 1999 because of Sizemore&#x27;s drug problems. He dated Heidi Fleiss, known as the onetime &quot;Hollywood Madam&quot;. He was for a time in a relationship with Janelle McIntire, who gave birth in July 2005 to his twin sons, Jagger and Jayden.

On October 19, 2005, Vivid Entertainment released &quot;The Tom Sizemore Sex Scandal&quot;, a pornographic video featuring Sizemore and three women. In the video, he said that he had sex with Paris Hilton. Hilton denied his claim and said it was a ploy by Sizemore to increase sales of the video.

=== Substance abuse and legal issues ===

Sizemore said that he battled drug addiction from age 15.

In 2003, Sizemore was convicted of domestic violence against ex-girlfriend Heidi Fleiss. On March 25, 2005, he was sentenced to seven months in jail and four months of drug treatment for repeatedly failing drug tests while on probation. He was caught attempting to fake a urine test using a Whizzinator. Fleiss&#x27; restraining order against him lapsed by 2010. 

On May 8, 2007, while still on probation for a previous drug conviction, he was arrested outside the Four Points Sheraton hotel in Bakersfield, California, for possession of methamphetamine.

In 2010, Sizemore appeared as a patient/castmember on VH1&#x27;s third season of &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;. Because Fleiss was also in treatment on the show that season, both she and Sizemore had to consent to appear together. His reunion with Fleiss was amicable. 

In 2013, he appeared on the episode &quot;Explosive Relationships&quot; of the talk show &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; in which he discussed his rise to stardom and the subsequent fallout after his years of struggling with substance abuse. Also in 2013, Sizemore claimed in an interview that he had begun to achieve sobriety after a stern interrogation from fellow actor Robert De Niro. De Niro personally checked Sizemore into rehabilitation.

In early 2014, a recording emerged of Sizemore alleging that former girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley had an affair with Bill Clinton in 1998. Under threat of legal action, Sizemore admitted that the allegation was false. He elaborated that the recording was made without his knowledge during a time when he was battling substance abuse. 

In February 2017, he pleaded no contest to two charges of domestic abuse for assaulting his girlfriend. He was sentenced to 36 months of summary probation, 30 days of community service and a year-long domestic violence program. He was subject to two protective orders associated with the charges and ordered to pay various fees. The deal was made by Sizemore to avoid spending 210 days in jail.

In November 2017, it was revealed by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; that Sizemore had been kicked off the set of the film &quot;Born Killers&quot; (then known as &quot;Piggy Banks&quot;) in 2003 for allegedly sexually molesting an 11-year-old actress when the film was in production near Salt Lake City, Utah. He denied any wrongdoing and was allowed back on the film set after the Salt Lake County prosecutor&#x27;s office decided against going forward with the case &quot;due to witness and evidence problems.&quot; 

In May 2018, actress Kiersten Pyke, by then 26 years old, filed a lawsuit against Sizemore, claiming that his alleged abuse caused longstanding emotional problems and seeking at least $3 million. A statement from Sizemore&#x27;s publicist again denied the abuse, noting that nothing amiss was reported by a &quot;Born Killers&quot; staff member whose duty was supervising the child actors who were on the set. 

On August 27, 2020, &quot;USA Today&quot; reported that a Utah judge had dismissed the lawsuit. Sizemore again denied her claims saying: &quot;Beyond the loss of work and the pain and humiliation this has caused me and my family, the thought that an 11-year old girl would think I violated her, whether it be because she misconstrued some inadvertent touching when the director placed her upon my lap for the photo shoot or someone else instilled this idea in her head for whatever malicious, self-serving reasons, is what devastates me most.&quot;

On January 5, 2019, Sizemore was arrested for misdemeanor drug possession of &quot;various illegal narcotics&quot; in Burbank, California.

== Death ==
On February 18, 2023, Sizemore suffered a brain aneurysm at his Los Angeles home and was hospitalized at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in critical condition. On February 27, his representative issued a statement indicating that doctors had determined there was &quot;no further hope&quot; for Sizemore to recover and had &quot;recommended end-of-life decisions&quot; to his family. Sizemore died on March 3, 2023, at the age of 61.

<text>Bambuco is a traditional music genre from Colombia. Its metric structure is similar to the European waltz or polska (not to be confused with the polka). Typically a bambuco piece is accompanied by a stylized group dance in either a or meter.

Bambuco took a cultural foothold in the Andean region of Colombia and has spread in popularity throughout Latin America. The Festival Folclórico y Reinado Nacional del Bambuco in Neiva is a festival celebrating bambuco music.

&quot;Cuatro Preguntas&quot; is one of the most famous songs in the genre, having been included by &quot;El Tiempo&quot; at No. 8 on its list of the 50 best Colombian songs of all time.

<text>A hymenotomy is a medical procedure involving the surgical removal or opening of the hymen. It is often performed on patients with an imperforate or septate hymen, or other situations where the hymen is unusually thick or rigid such as microperforate hymen. In the case of a female with a hymen without any opening, an opening may be created in order to facilitate menstruation. In situations where the opening is extremely small or the band(s) of a septate hymen limit access to the vaginal opening, the woman may elect for hymenotomy to allow for comfortable sexual penetration of her vagina, or to relieve pain or discomfort that occurs when inserting/removing tampons. Sexual intercourse would not normally be adversely affected by a hymenotomy.

<doc id="414323" wikidata="Q1527155" url="?curid=414323" title="2003 Russian legislative election">
<text>Legislative elections were held in Russia on 7December 2003. At stake were the 450 seats in the State Duma (&quot;Gosudarstvennaya Duma&quot;), the lower house of the Federal Assembly.

As expected, the pro-Vladimir Putin United Russia party received the most votes (38%) and won the most seats, gaining an absolute majority in the Duma. The Communist Party remained the second largest, though much reduced in strength. The Liberal Democratic Party improved its position by 19 seats, while the liberal Yabloko and the liberal-conservative Union of Right Forces lost most of their seats.

==Results==

==Legacy==
The 2003 election is cited by scholars as a turning point in Russian politics, as it marked the moment the federal parliament effectively became a rubber stamp body.

<text>Drumheller is a town on the Red Deer River in the badlands of east-central Alberta, Canada. It is located northeast of Calgary and south of Stettler. The Drumheller portion of the Red Deer River valley, often referred to as Dinosaur Valley, has an approximate width of and an approximate length of .

Drumheller was named after Samuel Drumheller, who, after purchasing the homestead of Thomas Patrick Greentree, had it surveyed into the original Drumheller townsite and put lots on the market in 1911. Also in 1911, Samuel Drumheller started coal mining operations near the townsite.

Drumheller got a railway station in 1912. It was then incorporated as a village on May 15, 1913, a town on March 2, 1916, and a city on April 3, 1930. Over a 15-year period, Drumheller&#x27;s population increased from 312 in 1916 to 2,987 in 1931 shortly after becoming a city.

Drumheller boomed until the end of the Second World War when coal lost most of its value.

The City of Drumheller amalgamated with the Municipal District of Badlands No. 7 on January 1, 1998, to form the current Town of Drumheller. Some of the reasons the two municipalities amalgamated included Badlands No. 7 having more in common with Drumheller than other surrounding rural municipalities and both were experiencing similar planning and development issues due to their locations within the Red Deer River valley. The amalgamated municipality opted for town status rather than city status so that highways within would remain the responsibility of the Province of Alberta. As a result of the amalgamation, Drumheller became Alberta&#x27;s largest town in terms of land area at .

The 1998 amalgamation resulted in Drumheller absorbing six hamlets that were previously under the jurisdiction of the Municipal District of Badlands No. 7—Cambria, East Coulee, Lehigh, Nacmine, Rosedale and Wayne. Drumheller also previously absorbed the hamlets of Bankview, Midlandvale (Midland), Newcastle and North Drumheller during annexations while under city status. Bankview and Midland were annexed in 1964 and 1972 respectively, while Newcastle and North Drumheller were both annexed in 1967. Other localities within Drumheller, either absorbed through past annexations or its eventual amalgamation with Badlands No. 7, include Aerial, Eladesor, Kneehill, Rosedale Station, Western Monarch (Atlas) and Willow Creek.

In total, Drumheller has absorbed at least 13 other communities in its history, some of which are now recognized as neighbourhoods or districts within the town.

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
Drumheller experiences a semi-arid climate (BSk) with very cold winters and hot summers. The highest temperature ever recorded in Drumheller was on July 18, 1941. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on January 29, 1996.

== Demographics ==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Drumheller had a population of 7,909 living in 3,198 of its 3,557 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 7,982. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Drumheller recorded a population of 7,982 living in 3,164 of its 3,471 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 8,029. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

== Economy ==
Drumheller was once the largest coal producing city in Western Canada, with the Atlas Coal Mine. Now, coal mining has been replaced by natural gas and oil. Drumheller has Alberta&#x27;s second largest natural gas field, the West Drumheller Field. However, Drumheller is planning to transition away from fossil fuels and emphasize renewable energy sources, such as wind power, in its economy.

Currently, tourism is Drumheller&#x27;s main industry. A federal prison and regional medical complex also contribute to the economy. Agriculture is also quite important.

== Attractions ==

South of the traffic bridge over the Red Deer river on Highway 9 is the &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Dinosaur&quot;, a 26.2-metre (86 ft) high fiberglass &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; that can be entered for a view of the Badlands, including the adjacent 23 metre (75 ft) water fountain, again one of the largest in Canada. Tourist attractions also include the Star Mine Suspension Bridge, Atlas Coal Mine, Canadian Badlands Passion Play, Horseshoe Canyon, Rotary Spray Park, Aquaplex (with indoor and outdoor pools), Horse Thief Canyon, hoodoos, Midland Provincial Park, the Rosedeer Hotel in Wayne, of constructed pathways, Bleriot Ferry, East Coulee School Museum, the Homestead Museum and the Little Church, which is capable of seating only six patrons.

Next to the now closed Drumheller ski hill is the Canadian Badlands Passion Play site, where, for two weeks each July, performances are held. The Badlands Amphitheatre began hosting the Passion Play in 1991. Companies are composed of actors from all over Alberta. The site also offers small plays throughout the summer and an interpretive centre.

Drumheller was also home to the Valley Doll Museum and Gifts, where it displayed over 700 dolls.

=== Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology ===

The Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology is a museum that hosts Canada&#x27;s largest collection of dinosaur fossils. It boasts 500,000 visitors a year, the largest of all provincial museum attractions. It opened on September 25, 1985. The museum is located in the northwest quadrant of the Town of Drumheller, in Midland Provincial Park and is operated by the Government of Alberta under the Ministry of Arts, Culture and Status of Women.

<doc id="414331" wikidata="Q469862" url="?curid=414331" title="The Naked Sun">
<text>The Naked Sun is a science fiction novel by American writer Isaac Asimov, the second in his &quot;Robot&quot; series. Like its predecessor, &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot;, this is a whodunit story. It was first published in book form in 1957 after being serialized in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; between October and December 1956.

==Plot==
The story arises from the murder of Rikaine Delmarre, a prominent &quot;fetologist&quot; (fetal scientist), responsible for the operation of the planetary birthing center of Solaria, a planet politically hostile to Earth, whose death Elijah Baley is called to investigate, at the request of the Solarian government. He is again partnered with the humanoid robot R. Daneel Olivaw, and asked by Earth&#x27;s government to assess the Solarian society for weaknesses.

The book focuses on the unusual traditions, customs, and culture of Solarian society. The planet has a rigidly controlled population of 20,000, and all work is done by robots, which outnumber humans ten thousand to one.

Normally the prime suspect in a murder would have been Delmarre&#x27;s wife Gladia, who was present in the house when he was killed by being beaten over the head. She claims to have no memory of what happened, nor is there any sign of the object used to beat Rikaine Delmarre to death. The only witness is a malfunctioning house robot that has suffered damage to its positronic brain because it allowed harm to be done to a human, in violation of the First Law.

Baley&#x27;s first encounter with Gladia is through &quot;viewing&quot; (holography), at which point he discovers that Solarians have no taboo about nudity when viewing, though Baley is shocked. Thereafter he develops a relationship with Gladia in face-to-face contact. She reveals to Baley that she does not like all the customs of Solaria, where face-to-face interaction, and especially sex, are considered repugnant, and was on bad terms with Rikaine, partly from sexual frustration.

The situation becomes more complex when Hannis Gruer, the Head of Security on Solaria, is poisoned while viewing with Baley. Baley, unable to intervene physically, has to call on Gruer&#x27;s robots to save him. Baley is able to prevent the house robots from cleaning up the scene and destroying evidence, which happened after Delmarre&#x27;s death.

Ultimately, it is revealed that Delmarre&#x27;s neighbor, roboticist Jothan Leebig, was working on putting positronic brains in spaceships. This would negate the First Law, as such ships would not recognize that humans usually inhabit ships, and would therefore be able to attack and destroy other ships without regard for their crews. Delmarre was one of his opponents, as were other Solarians who were horrified by the prospect of robots that could actually harm humans. Leebig poisoned Gruer by tricking his robots, using his knowledge of positronic brains, into putting poison into Gruer&#x27;s drink. Daneel goes to arrest Leebig, who kills himself in Solarian fear of human contact, not knowing that Daneel is a robot. It is assumed that he also engineered the murder of Rikaine Delmarre. Baley conceals Gladia&#x27;s role on the grounds that her emotional breakdown was under the pressure of the Solarian way of life. Leebig had instructed one of the Delmarre house robots to detach an arm and give it to Gladia in the heat of an argument. She then hit her husband with it, killing him, before going into a fugue state, after which she remembered nothing. She decides to emigrate to the Spacer planet of Aurora.

Baley returns to Earth to acclaim from his boss. Asked by his boss to reveal any weaknesses he found, Baley says that the features once regarded as Spacer strengths—their robots, low population, and long lives—will ultimately prove to be weaknesses. The lack of cooperation between them discourages an active, exploratory attitude that Earth-born humans will eventually rediscover once they are able to leave Earth.

The story of the after-effects can be found in the sequel &quot;The Robots of Dawn&quot;.

Asimov examined Solaria&#x27;s far future in &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot; (1986).

==Reception==
&quot;Galaxy&quot; reviewer Floyd C. Gale praised the novel as &quot;an interesting exercise in scientific detection ... Asimov appears to be laying the groundwork for a new category of science fiction, the S-F detective story&quot;.

==Physical distancing==
Asimov portrays in &quot;The Naked Sun&quot; a world focused on avoiding physical contact with other people. The Solarians interact with each other largely through technology. They live far from each other, spread out across a sparsely populated planet. People are taught from birth to avoid physical contact, and live on huge estates, either alone or with their spouse only. Face-to-face interaction (referred to in the book as &quot;seeing&quot;) is seen as a repugnant chore. Communication takes place through technology: holography, 3-D television. Communicating with each other in this fashion is referred to as &quot;viewing&quot;, in contrast to &quot;seeing&quot;, which is face-to-face. Communication is frequent, but it is &quot;viewing&quot; of a transmitted image. Nudity in front of others is common. Sex is only practiced for reproduction when replacement of a citizen is necessary, and is considered a chore even more repugnant than seeing. A character remarks that to be in the same room with another person is &quot;most unpleasant... I feel strongly as though something slimy were about to touch me.&quot; A doctor has to &quot;get hardened&quot; to it.

Baley, however (while traveling in a closed vehicle because of his own agoraphobia, resulting from his life in the enclosed cities of Earth), insists on face-to-face conversations. The Solarians&#x27; phobia against in-person contact is so strong that a character commits suicide to avoid it.

==Adaptations==
The novel was adapted for television as an episode of the British anthology series &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot;, with Baley being portrayed by Paul Maxwell and Daneel by David Collings. Broadcast on BBC2 on 18 February 1969, the story was dramatised by Robert Muller and directed by Rudolph Cartier and the music and sound effects were created by Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.

Cast of BBC2 Adaptation:

* Paul Maxwell as Elijah Baley
* David Collings as R Daneel Olivaw
* Sheila Burrell as Under-Secretary Minnim
* Neil Hallett as Hannis Gruer
* Erik Chitty as Dr Altim Thool
* Ronald Leigh-Hunt as Corwin Attlebish

* Paul Stassino as Rikaine Delmarre
* John Hicks as Bik
* David Cargill as Robot
* Raymond Hardy as Robot
* Roy Patrick as Robot
* John Scott Martin as Robot
* Gerald Taylor as Robot

&quot;The Naked Sun&quot; was one of six Asimov stories dramatised for the &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot; series. The others were &quot;The Dead Past&quot;, &quot;Sucker Bait&quot;, &quot;Satisfaction Guaranteed&quot;, &quot;Reason&quot; (as &quot;The Prophet&quot;) and &quot;Liar!&quot;

Although the episode was wiped by the BBC and no copy is known to exist, three of Delia Derbyshire&#x27;s sound sequences were published on a BBC record of sound effects Out of This World, renamed as &quot;Heat Haze&quot;, &quot;Frozen Waste&quot; and &quot;Icy Peak&quot;. The episode was reconstructed using stills, audio clips, subtitles and CGI for the DVD released by the BFI in November 2014.

In 1978, the novel was adapted in the Soviet Union under the name &quot;The Last Alternative&quot; (Последняя альтернатива)

In 2023, a Persian translation of the book was published in Iran.

<text>Presidential elections were held in Mauritania on 7 November 2003. As expected, incumbent President Maaouya Ould Sid&#x27;Ahmed Taya was easily re-elected against weak opposition. 

The opposition alleged election fraud, and Ould Taya&#x27;s main challenger, former military ruler Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla (the man who Ould Taya ousted when he seized power in December 1984), was arrested both immediately before and after the vote. The elections saw two notable firsts; Aicha Bint Jeddane was the country&#x27;s first female presidential candidate, and Messaoud Ould Boulkheir was the first descendant of slaves to run for the office.

The elections took place a few months after a violent unsuccessful coup attempt in June 2003. Ould Taya was overthrown in a coup two years later, in August 2005.

<doc id="414341" wikidata="Q17084824" url="?curid=414341" title="Teeth cleaning">
<text>Teeth cleaning is part of oral hygiene and involves the removal of dental plaque from teeth with the intention of preventing cavities (dental caries), gingivitis, and periodontal disease.

People routinely clean their own teeth by brushing and interdental cleaning, and dental hygienists can remove hardened deposits (tartar) not removed by routine cleaning. Those with dentures and natural teeth may supplement their cleaning with a denture cleaner.

== Brushing, scrubbing and flossing ==
=== Brushing ===
Careful and frequent brushing with a toothbrush helps to prevent build-up of plaque bacteria on the teeth. Electric toothbrushes were developed, and initially recommended for people with strength or dexterity problems in their hands, but they have come into widespread general use. The effectiveness of electric toothbrushes at reducing plaque formation and gingivitis is superior to conventional manual toothbrushes.

Instuctions&lt;br&gt;
Source:

Ensuring effective brushing is important in getting rid of food and bacteria properly. 

Step 1) Place a pea-sized amount of toothpaste on the brush and hold at a 45-degree angle.

Step 2) In small circular and back and forth motions, move the brush gently along teeth and gums.

Step 3) Brush all surfaces inside the mouth, including the tongue. Ensure that the back sides of the teeth (top and bottom rows) are being cleaned by brushing vertically in up and down motions.

Tip) It is recommended to use a 2/2 strategy which includes brushing two minutes in the morning and two minutes at night as a minimum standard for healthy gums and teeth. 
=== Flossing ===
In addition to brushing, cleaning between teeth may help to prevent build-up of plaque bacteria on the teeth. This may be done with dental floss or interdental brushes.

80% of cavities occur in the grooves, or pits and fissures, of the chewing surfaces of the teeth, however, there is no evidence currently showing that normal at-home flossing reduces the risk of cavities in these areas.
Special appliances or tools may be used to supplement toothbrushing and interdental cleaning. These include special toothpicks, oral irrigators, and other devices. A 2015 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to determine whether the interdental brushing decreases the levels of plaque when compared to flossing.

== Professional teeth cleaning ==
Teeth cleaning (also known as &quot;prophylaxis&quot;, literally a preventive treatment of a disease) is a procedure for the removal of tartar (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful brushing and flossing, especially in areas that are difficult to reach in routine toothbrushing. It is often done by a dental hygienist. Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling, tooth polishing, and debridement if too much tartar has accumulated. This involves the use of various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from the teeth. The American Dental Association has designated the code D1110 for adult prophylaxis or dental cleaning and has also designated the code D1120 for the same procedure in children.

As to the frequency of cleaning, research on this matter is inconclusive. That is, it has &quot;neither&quot; been shown that more frequent cleaning leads to better outcomes &quot;nor&quot; that it does not. A review of the research literature on the question concluded &quot;[t]he research evidence is not of sufficient quality to reach any conclusions regarding the beneficial and adverse effects of routine scaling and polishing for periodontal health and regarding the effects of providing this intervention at different time intervals&quot;. Thus, any general recommendation for a frequency of routine cleaning (e.g. every six months, every year) has no empirical basis.

== Complications ==

Overly vigorous or incorrectly performed brushing or flossing may cause injury to the gingiva (gums). Improper or over-vigorous brushing may cause sore gums, damage to tooth enamel, gingivitis, and bleeding gums. Dentists and dental hygienists can instruct and demonstrate proper brushing or flossing techniques.

Aerosols generated during dental cleaning procedures may spread infection. During the COVID-19 pandemic on 12 August 2020, the World Health Organization recommended that routine dental checkups be delayed in areas of community transmission. Characteristics and detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in alternative sites and specimens related to dentistry has been extensively reviewed.

== Disinfection ==

Antiseptics help reduce the number of microorganisms present in the oral cavity. Antiseptics are recommended for both daily home care regimens and for use in the dental office setting. These products are used as a preprocedural rinse to reduce bacterial counts prior to routine dental treatments and injections. 

A common antiseptic rinsing agent used in the dental office is a 0.2% chlorhexidine product which provides a lowered bacterial count for more than 60 minutes. 

== Acidity and decay relationship ==

The regulation of acid production and exposure in the oral cavity is of the utmost importance to maintain healthy enamel. When enamel, cementum, and /or dentin are subjected to an increased number of acidogenic and aciduric bacteria in dental biofilm, the demineralization process begins. When acidogenic and aciduric bacteria predominate the oral flora, there is an increased risk of developing caries. 

=== Reducing acid exposure ===
Dietary habits:

* Reduce fermentable carbohydrate intake frequency
* Limit snacking between meals and in the middle of the night
* Avoid acidic beverages between meals
* Use xylitol gum or mints between meals

==History==
Historically, professional tooth cleaning was sometimes referred to as &quot;odontexesis&quot; (literally &quot;tooth-scraping&quot;) or &quot;odontexis&quot; (&quot;scraping off&quot;), and the instruments involved &quot;odontoglyphs&quot;. 

Alfred C. Fones, known as the &quot;father of dental hygiene,&quot; was the first to develop the role of a dental hygienist into the current concept of a dental educator and dental professional. The dental hygienist is qualified, same as a dentist, to perform routine dental cleanings.

<text>Racketeer Rabbit is a 1946 Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on September 14, 1946, and features Bugs Bunny.

==Plot==
Bugs Bunny seeks shelter for the night and unwittingly ends up in an abandoned gothic farmhouse, which serves as the hideout for two gangsters, Rocky (caricature of Edward G. Robinson) and Hugo (caricature of Peter Lorre). A chaotic series of events unfolds when Rocky and Hugo return, pursued by rival gangsters, leading to a frenzied gunfight inside the farmhouse. Despite the chaos, Bugs nonchalantly interrupts the mayhem to attend to his basic needs before returning to bed.

During a division of the loot from a recent heist, Bugs cleverly tricks Rocky into relinquishing all the money by assuming various disguises. However, Rocky catches on and demands the money back, leading to a confrontation. Bugs outwits Rocky again by posing as different characters, ultimately causing Rocky&#x27;s humiliation.

In a final showdown, Bugs assumes the role of a gangster and engages in a comedic altercation with Rocky, culminating in Bugs orchestrating a mock police raid. Using his wit and ingenuity, Bugs ultimately triumphs over Rocky, leaving the gangster defeated and fleeing the scene in a panic. Bugs, with a sigh, reflects on the inability of some individuals to handle humorous situations before returning to his carefree demeanor.

==Details==
When entering the house, Bugs remarks &quot;Huh? Sounds like Inner Sanctum!&quot;, a reference to the popular mystery radio program that aired from January 7, 1941, to October 5, 1952. Bugs impersonates Bugsy Siegel and flips a coin like George Raft in &quot;Scarface&quot; (1932). His Brooklynite accent serves to complete the image of a tough crook.

<doc id="414350" wikidata="Q133772" url="?curid=414350" title="Tooth decay">
<text>Dental cavity, also known as tooth decay, is the breakdown of teeth due to acids produced by bacteria. The resulting cavities may be a number of different colors, from yellow to black. Symptoms may include pain and difficulty eating. Complications may include inflammation of the tissue around the tooth, tooth loss and infection or abscess formation. Tooth regeneration is an ongoing stem cell–based field of study that aims to find methods to reverse the effects of decay; current methods are based on easing symptoms.
The cause of cavities is acid from bacteria dissolving the hard tissues of the teeth (enamel, dentin and cementum). The acid is produced by the bacteria when they break down food debris or sugar on the tooth surface. Simple sugars in food are these bacteria&#x27;s primary energy source and thus a diet high in simple sugar is a risk factor. If mineral breakdown is greater than buildup from sources such as saliva, caries results. Risk factors include conditions that result in less saliva, such as diabetes mellitus, Sjögren syndrome and some medications. Medications that decrease saliva production include antihistamines and antidepressants. Dental caries are also associated with poverty, poor cleaning of the mouth, and receding gums resulting in exposure of the roots of the teeth.
Prevention of dental caries includes regular cleaning of the teeth, a diet low in sugar, and small amounts of fluoride. Brushing one&#x27;s teeth twice per day, and flossing between the teeth once a day is recommended. Fluoride may be acquired from water, salt or toothpaste among other sources. Treating a mother&#x27;s dental caries may decrease the risk in her children by decreasing the number of certain bacteria she may spread to them. Screening can result in earlier detection. Depending on the extent of destruction, various treatments can be used to restore the tooth to proper function, or the tooth may be removed. There is no known method to grow back large amounts of tooth. The availability of treatment is often poor in the developing world. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen may be taken for pain.
Worldwide, approximately 3.6 billion people (48% of the population) have dental caries in their permanent teeth as of 2016. The World Health Organization estimates that nearly all adults have dental caries at some point in time. In baby teeth it affects about 620 million people or 9% of the population. They have become more common in both children and adults in recent years. The disease is most common in the developed world due to greater simple sugar consumption, but less common in the developing world. Caries is Latin for &quot;rottenness&quot;.
==Signs and symptoms==

A person experiencing caries may not be aware of the disease. The earliest sign of a new carious lesion is the appearance of a chalky white spot on the surface of the tooth, indicating an area of demineralization of enamel. This is referred to as a white spot lesion, an incipient carious lesion, or a &quot;micro-cavity&quot;. As the lesion continues to demineralize, it can turn brown but will eventually turn into a cavitation (&quot;cavity&quot;).  Before the cavity forms, the process is reversible, but once a cavity forms, the lost tooth structure cannot be regenerated.
A lesion that appears dark brown and shiny suggests dental caries were once present, but the demineralization process has stopped, leaving a stain. Active decay is lighter in color and dull in appearance.

As the enamel and dentin are destroyed, the cavity becomes more noticeable. The affected areas of the tooth change color and become soft to the touch. Once the decay passes through the enamel, the dentinal tubules, which have passages to the nerve of the tooth, become exposed, resulting in pain that can be transient, temporarily worsening with exposure to heat, cold, or sweet foods and drinks. A tooth weakened by extensive internal decay can sometimes suddenly fracture under normal chewing forces. When the decay has progressed enough to allow the bacteria to overwhelm the pulp tissue in the center of the tooth, a toothache can result, and the pain will become more constant. Death of the pulp tissue and infection are common consequences. The tooth will no longer be sensitive to hot or cold but can be very tender to pressure.

Dental caries can also cause bad breath and foul tastes. In highly progressed cases, an infection can spread from the tooth to the surrounding soft tissues. Complications such as cavernous sinus thrombosis and Ludwig angina can be life-threatening.

==Cause==

Four things are required for caries to form: a tooth surface (enamel or dentin), caries-causing bacteria, fermentable carbohydrates (such as sucrose), and time. This involves adherence of food to the teeth and acid creation by the bacteria that makes up the dental plaque. However, these four criteria are not always enough to cause the disease and a sheltered environment promoting development of a cariogenic biofilm is required. The caries disease process does not have an inevitable outcome, and different individuals will be susceptible to different degrees depending on the shape of their teeth, oral hygiene habits, and the buffering capacity of their saliva. Dental caries can occur on any surface of a tooth that is exposed to the oral cavity, but not the structures that are retained within the bone.

Tooth decay is caused by biofilm (dental plaque) lying on the teeth and maturing to become cariogenic (causing decay). Certain bacteria in the biofilm produce acids, primarily lactic acid, in the presence of fermentable carbohydrates such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose.

Caries occur more often in people from the lower end of the socio-economic scale than people from the upper end of the socio-economic scale, due to lack of education about dental care, and lack of access to professional dental care which may be expensive.

===Bacteria===

The most common bacteria associated with dental cavities are the mutans streptococci, most prominently &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus sobrinus&quot;, and lactobacilli. However, cariogenic bacteria (the ones that can cause the disease) are present in dental plaque, but they are usually in too low concentrations to cause problems unless there is a shift in the balance. This is driven by local environmental change, such as frequent sugar intake or inadequate biofilm removal (toothbrushing). If left untreated, the disease can lead to pain, tooth loss and infection.

The mouth contains a wide variety of oral bacteria, but only a few specific species of bacteria are believed to cause dental caries: &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot; and &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; species among them. &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot; are gram-positive bacteria which constitute biofilms on the surface of teeth. These organisms can produce high levels of lactic acid following fermentation of dietary sugars and are resistant to the adverse effects of low pH, properties essential for cariogenic bacteria. As the cementum of root surfaces is more easily demineralized than enamel surfaces, a wider variety of bacteria can cause root caries, including &quot;Lactobacillus acidophilus&quot;, &quot;Actinomyces spp.&quot;, &quot;Nocardia spp.&quot;, and &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot;. Bacteria collect around the teeth and gums in a sticky, creamy-coloured mass called plaque, which serves as a biofilm. Some sites collect plaque more commonly than others, for example, sites with a low rate of salivary flow (molar fissures). Grooves on the occlusal surfaces of molar and premolar teeth provide microscopic retention sites for plaque bacteria, as do the interproximal sites. Plaque may also collect above or below the gingiva, where it is referred to as supra- or sub-gingival plaque, respectively.

These bacterial strains, most notably &quot;S. mutans&quot;, can be inherited by a child from a caretaker&#x27;s kiss or through feeding pre-masticated food.

===Dietary sugars===
Bacteria in a person&#x27;s mouth convert glucose, fructose, and most commonly sucrose (table sugar) into acids, mainly lactic acid, through a glycolytic process called fermentation. If left in contact with the tooth, these acids may cause demineralization, which is the dissolution of its mineral content. The process is dynamic, however, as remineralization can also occur if the acid is neutralized by saliva or mouthwash. Fluoride toothpaste or dental varnish may aid remineralization. If demineralization continues over time, enough mineral content may be lost so that the soft organic material left behind disintegrates, forming a cavity or hole. The impact such sugars have on the progress of dental caries is called cariogenicity. Sucrose, although a bound glucose and fructose unit, is in fact more cariogenic than a mixture of equal parts of glucose and fructose. This is due to the bacteria using the energy in the saccharide bond between the glucose and fructose subunits. &quot;S.mutans&quot; adheres to the biofilm on the tooth by converting sucrose into an extremely adhesive substance called dextran polysaccharide by the enzyme dextran sucranase.

===Exposure===

The frequency with which teeth are exposed to cariogenic (acidic) environments affects the likelihood of caries development. After meals or snacks, the bacteria in the mouth metabolize sugar, resulting in an acidic by-product that decreases pH. As time progresses, the pH returns to normal due to the buffering capacity of saliva and the dissolved mineral content of tooth surfaces. During every exposure to the acidic environment, portions of the inorganic mineral content at the surface of teeth dissolve and can remain dissolved for two hours. Since teeth are vulnerable during these acidic periods, the development of dental caries relies heavily on the frequency of acid exposure.

The carious process can begin within days of a tooth&#x27;s erupting into the mouth if the diet is sufficiently rich in suitable carbohydrates. Evidence suggests that the introduction of fluoride treatments has slowed the process. Proximal caries take an average of four years to pass through enamel in permanent teeth. Because the cementum enveloping the root surface is not nearly as durable as the enamel encasing the crown, root caries tend to progress much more rapidly than decay on other surfaces. The progression and loss of mineralization on the root surface is 2.5 times faster than caries in enamel. In very severe cases where oral hygiene is very poor and where the diet is very rich in fermentable carbohydrates, caries may cause cavities within months of tooth eruption. This can occur, for example, when children continuously drink sugary drinks from baby bottles (see later discussion).

===Teeth===
There are certain diseases and disorders affecting teeth that may leave an individual at a greater risk for cavities.

Molar incisor hypo-mineralization seems to be increasingly common. While the cause is unknown it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Possible contributing factors that have been investigated include systemic factors such as high levels of dioxins or polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) in the mother&#x27;s milk, premature birth and oxygen deprivation at birth, and certain disorders during the child&#x27;s first 3 years such as mumps, diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles, hypoparathyroidism, malnutrition, malabsorption, hypo-vitaminosis D, chronic respiratory diseases, or undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease, which usually presents with mild or absent gastrointestinal symptoms.

Amelogenesis imperfecta, which occurs in between 1 in 718 and 1 in 14,000 individuals, is a disease in which the enamel does not fully form or forms in insufficient amounts and can fall off a tooth. In both cases, teeth may be left more vulnerable to decay because the enamel is not able to protect the tooth.

In most people, disorders or diseases affecting teeth are not the primary cause of dental caries. Approximately 96% of tooth enamel is composed of minerals. These minerals, especially hydroxyapatite, will become soluble when exposed to acidic environments. Enamel begins to demineralize at a pH of 5.5. Dentin and cementum are more susceptible to caries than enamel because they have lower mineral content. Thus, when root surfaces of teeth are exposed from gingival recession or periodontal disease, caries can develop more readily. Even in a healthy oral environment, however, the tooth is susceptible to dental caries.

The evidence for linking malocclusion and/or crowding to dental caries is weak; however, the anatomy of teeth may affect the likelihood of caries formation. Where the deep developmental grooves of teeth are more numerous and exaggerated, pit and fissure caries is more likely to develop (see next section). Also, caries is more likely to develop when food is trapped between teeth.

===Other factors===
Reduced salivary flow rate is associated with increased caries since the buffering capability of saliva is not present to counterbalance the acidic environment created by certain foods. As a result, medical conditions that reduce the amount of saliva produced by salivary glands, in particular the submandibular gland and parotid gland, are likely to lead to dry mouth and thus to widespread tooth decay. Examples include Sjögren syndrome, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, and sarcoidosis. Medications, such as antihistamines and antidepressants, can also impair salivary flow. Stimulants, most notoriously methylamphetamine, also occlude the flow of saliva to an extreme degree. This is known as meth mouth. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active chemical substance in cannabis, also causes a nearly complete occlusion of salivation, known in colloquial terms as &quot;cotton mouth&quot;. Moreover, 63% of the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States list dry mouth as a known side-effect. Radiation therapy of the head and neck may also damage the cells in salivary glands, somewhat increasing the likelihood of caries formation.

Susceptibility to caries can be related to altered metabolism in the tooth, in particular to fluid flow in the dentin. Experiments on rats have shown that a high-sucrose, cariogenic diet &quot;significantly suppresses the rate of fluid motion&quot; in dentin.

The use of tobacco may also increase the risk for caries formation. Some brands of smokeless tobacco contain high sugar content, increasing susceptibility to caries. Tobacco use is a significant risk factor for periodontal disease, which can cause the gingiva to recede. As the gingiva loses attachment to the teeth due to gingival recession, the root surface becomes more visible in the mouth. If this occurs, root caries is a concern since the cementum covering the roots of teeth is more easily demineralized by acids than enamel. Currently, there is not enough evidence to support a causal relationship between smoking and coronal caries, but evidence does suggest a relationship between smoking and root-surface caries.
Exposure of children to secondhand tobacco smoke is associated with tooth decay.

Intrauterine and neonatal lead exposure promote tooth decay. Besides lead, all atoms with electrical charge and ionic radius similar to bivalent calcium,
such as cadmium, mimic the calcium ion and therefore exposure to them may promote tooth decay.

Poverty is also a significant social determinant for oral health. Dental caries have been linked with lower socio-economic status and can be considered a disease of poverty.

Forms are available for risk assessment for caries when treating dental cases; this system using the evidence-based Caries Management by Risk Assessment (CAMBRA). It is still unknown if the identification of high-risk individuals can lead to more effective long-term patient management that prevents caries initiation and arrests or reverses the progression of lesions.

Saliva also contains iodine and EGF. EGF results effective in cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival. Salivary EGF, which seems also regulated by dietary inorganic iodine, plays an important physiological role in the maintenance of oral (and gastro-oesophageal) tissue integrity, and, on the other hand, iodine is effective in prevention of dental caries and oral health.

==Pathophysiology==

Teeth are bathed in saliva and have a coating of bacteria on them (biofilm) that continually forms. The development of biofilm begins with pellicle formation. Pellicle is an acellular proteinaceous film which covers the teeth. Bacteria colonize on the teeth by adhering to the pellicle-coated surface. Over time, a mature biofilm is formed, creating a cariogenic environment on the tooth surface. The minerals in the hard tissues of the teeth enamel, dentin and cementum are constantly undergoing demineralization and remineralization. Dental caries result when the demineralization rate is faster than the remineralization, producing net mineral loss, which occurs when there is an ecologic shift within the dental biofilm from a balanced population of microorganisms to a population that produces acids and can survive in an acid environment.

===Enamel===
Tooth enamel is a highly mineralized acellular tissue, and caries act upon it through a chemical process brought on by the acidic environment produced by bacteria. As the bacteria consume the sugar and use it for their own energy, they produce lactic acid. The effects of this process include the demineralization of crystals in the enamel, caused by acids, over time until the bacteria physically penetrate the dentin. Enamel rods, which are the basic unit of the enamel structure, run perpendicularly from the surface of the tooth to the dentin. Since demineralization of enamel by caries follows the direction of the enamel rods, the different triangular patterns between pit and fissure and smooth-surface caries develop in the enamel because the orientation of enamel rods are different in the two areas of the tooth.
As the enamel loses minerals, and dental caries progresses, the enamel develops several distinct zones, visible under a light microscope. From the deepest layer of the enamel to the enamel surface, the identified areas are the: translucent zone, dark zones, body of the lesion, and surface zone. The translucent zone is the first visible sign of caries and coincides with a one to two percent loss of minerals. A slight remineralization of enamel occurs in the dark zone, which serves as an example of how the development of dental caries is an active process with alternating changes. The area of greatest demineralization and destruction is in the body of the lesion itself. The surface zone remains relatively mineralized and is present until the loss of tooth structure results in a cavitation.

===Dentin===
Unlike enamel, the dentin reacts to the progression of dental caries. After tooth formation, the ameloblasts, which produce enamel, are destroyed once enamel formation is complete and thus cannot later regenerate enamel after its destruction. On the other hand, dentin is produced continuously throughout life by odontoblasts, which reside at the border between the pulp and dentin. Since odontoblasts are present, a stimulus, such as caries, can trigger a biologic response. These defense mechanisms include the formation of sclerotic and tertiary dentin.

In dentin from the deepest layer to the enamel, the distinct areas affected by caries are the advancing front, the zone of bacterial penetration, and the zone of destruction. The advancing front represents a zone of demineralized dentin due to acid and has no bacteria present. The zones of bacterial penetration and destruction are the locations of invading bacteria and ultimately the decomposition of dentin. The zone of destruction has a more mixed bacterial population where proteolytic enzymes have destroyed the organic matrix. The innermost dentin caries has been reversibly attacked because the collagen matrix is not severely damaged, giving it potential for repair.

====Sclerotic dentin====
The structure of dentin is an arrangement of microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward from the pulp chamber to the exterior cementum or enamel border. The diameter of the dentinal tubules is largest near the pulp (about 2.5 μm) and smallest (about 900 nm) at the junction of dentin and enamel. The carious process continues through the dentinal tubules, which are responsible for the triangular patterns resulting from the progression of caries deep into the tooth. The tubules also allow caries to progress faster.

In response, the fluid inside the tubules brings immunoglobulins from the immune system to fight the bacterial infection. At the same time, there is an increase of mineralization of the surrounding tubules. This results in a constriction of the tubules, which is an attempt to slow the bacterial progression. In addition, as the acid from the bacteria demineralizes the hydroxyapatite crystals, calcium and phosphorus are released, allowing for the precipitation of more crystals which fall deeper into the dentinal tubule. These crystals form a barrier and slow the advancement of caries. After these protective responses, the dentin is considered sclerotic.

According to hydrodynamic theory, fluids within dentinal tubules are believed to be the mechanism by which pain receptors are triggered within the pulp of the tooth. Since sclerotic dentin prevents the passage of such fluids, pain that would otherwise serve as a warning of the invading bacteria may not develop at first.

====Tertiary dentin====

In response to dental caries, there may be production of more dentin toward the direction of the pulp. This new dentin is referred to as tertiary dentin. Tertiary dentin is produced to protect the pulp for as long as possible from the advancing bacteria. As more tertiary dentin is produced, the size of the pulp decreases. This type of dentin has been subdivided according to the presence or absence of the original odontoblasts. If the odontoblasts survive long enough to react to the dental caries, then the dentin produced is called &quot;reactionary&quot; dentin. If the odontoblasts are killed, the dentin produced is called &quot;reparative&quot; dentin.

In the case of reparative dentin, other cells are needed to assume the role of the destroyed odontoblasts. Growth factors, especially TGF-β, are thought to initiate the production of reparative dentin by fibroblasts and mesenchymal cells of the pulp. Reparative dentin is produced at an average of 1.5 μm/day, but can be increased to 3.5 μm/day. The resulting dentin contains irregularly shaped dentinal tubules that may not line up with existing dentinal tubules. This diminishes the ability for dental caries to progress within the dentinal tubules.

===Cementum===
The incidence of cemental caries increases in older adults as gingival recession occurs from either trauma or periodontal disease. It is a chronic condition that forms a large, shallow lesion and slowly invades first the root&#x27;s cementum and then dentin to cause a chronic infection of the pulp (see further discussion under classification by affected hard tissue). Because dental pain is a late finding, many lesions are not detected early, resulting in restorative challenges and increased tooth loss.

==Diagnosis==

The presentation of caries is highly variable. However, the risk factors and stages of development are similar. Initially, it may appear as a small chalky area (smooth surface caries), which may eventually develop into a large cavitation. Sometimes caries may be directly visible. However other methods of detection such as X-rays are used for less visible areas of teeth and to judge the extent of destruction. Lasers for detecting caries allow detection without ionizing radiation and are now used for detection of interproximal decay (between the teeth).

Primary diagnosis involves inspection of all visible tooth surfaces using a good light source, dental mirror and explorer. Dental radiographs (X-rays) may show dental caries before it is otherwise visible, in particular caries between the teeth. Large areas of dental caries are often apparent to the naked eye, but smaller lesions can be difficult to identify. Visual and tactile inspection along with radiographs are employed frequently among dentists, in particular to diagnose pit and fissure caries. Early, uncavitated caries is often diagnosed by blowing air across the suspect surface, which removes moisture and changes the optical properties of the unmineralized enamel.

Some dental researchers have cautioned against the use of dental explorers to find caries, in particular sharp ended explorers. In cases where a small area of tooth has begun demineralizing but has not yet cavitated, the pressure from the dental explorer could cause a cavity. Since the carious process is reversible before a cavity is present, it may be possible to arrest caries with fluoride and remineralize the tooth surface. When a cavity is present, a restoration will be needed to replace the lost tooth structure.

At times, pit and fissure caries may be difficult to detect. Bacteria can penetrate the enamel to reach dentin, but then the outer surface may remineralize, especially if fluoride is present. These caries, sometimes referred to as &quot;hidden caries&quot;, will still be visible on X-ray radiographs, but visual examination of the tooth would show the enamel intact or minimally perforated.

The differential diagnosis for dental caries includes dental fluorosis and developmental defects of the tooth including hypomineralization of the tooth and hypoplasia of the tooth.

The early carious lesion is characterized by demineralization of the tooth surface, altering the tooth&#x27;s optical properties. Technology using laser speckle image (LSI) techniques may provide a diagnostic aid to detect early carious lesions.

===Classification===

Caries can be classified by location, etiology, rate of progression, and affected hard tissues. These forms of classification can be used to characterize a particular case of tooth decay to more accurately represent the condition to others and also indicate the severity of tooth destruction. In some instances, caries is described in other ways that might indicate the cause. The G. V. Black classification is as follows:

* Class I: occlusal surfaces of posterior teeth, buccal or lingual pits on molars, lingual pit near cingulum of maxillary incisors
* Class II: proximal surfaces of posterior teeth
* Class III: interproximal surfaces of anterior teeth without incisal edge involvement
* Class IV: interproximal surfaces of anterior teeth with incisal edge involvement
* Class V: cervical third of facial or lingual surface of tooth
* Class VI: incisal or occlusal edge is worn away due to attrition

===Early childhood caries===
Early childhood caries (ECC), also known as &quot;baby bottle caries,&quot; &quot;baby bottle tooth decay&quot; or &quot;bottle rot,&quot; is a pattern of decay found in young children with their deciduous (baby) teeth. This must include the presence of at least one carious lesion on a primary tooth in a child under the age of 6 years. The teeth most likely affected are the maxillary anterior teeth, but all teeth can be affected. The name for this type of caries comes from the fact that the decay usually is a result of allowing children to fall asleep with sweetened liquids in their bottles or feeding children sweetened liquids multiple times during the day.

Another pattern of decay is &quot;rampant caries&quot;, which signifies advanced or severe decay on multiple surfaces of many teeth. Rampant caries may be seen in individuals with xerostomia, poor oral hygiene, stimulant use (due to drug-induced dry mouth), and/or large sugar intake. If rampant caries is a result of previous radiation to the head and neck, it may be described as radiation-induced caries. Problems can also be caused by the self-destruction of roots and whole tooth resorption when new teeth erupt or later from unknown causes.

Children at 6–12 months are at increased risk of developing dental caries.

A range of studies have reported that there is a correlation between caries in primary teeth and caries in permanent teeth.

===Rate of progression===

Temporal descriptions can be applied to caries to indicate the progression rate and previous history. &quot;Acute&quot; signifies a quickly developing condition, whereas &quot;chronic&quot; describes a condition that has taken an extended time to develop, in which thousands of meals and snacks, many causing some acid demineralization that is not remineralized, eventually result in cavities.

Recurrent caries, also described as secondary, are caries that appear at a location with a previous history of caries. This is frequently found on the margins of fillings and other dental restorations. On the other hand, incipient caries describes decay at a location that has not experienced previous decay. Arrested caries describes a lesion on a tooth that was previously demineralized but was remineralized before causing a cavitation. Fluoride treatment can help recalcification of tooth enamel as well as the use of amorphous calcium phosphate.

Micro-invasive interventions (such as dental sealant or resin infiltration) have been shown to slow down the progression of proximal decay.

===Affected hard tissue===
Depending on which hard tissues are affected, it is possible to describe caries as involving enamel, dentin, or cementum. Early in its development, caries may affect only enamel. Once the extent of decay reaches the deeper layer of dentin, the term &quot;dentinal caries&quot; is used. Since cementum is the hard tissue that covers the roots of teeth, it is not often affected by decay unless the roots of teeth are exposed to the mouth. Although the term &quot;cementum caries&quot; may be used to describe the decay on roots of teeth, very rarely does caries affect the cementum alone.

==Prevention==
===Oral hygiene===
The primary approach to dental hygiene care consists of tooth-brushing and flossing. The purpose of oral hygiene is to remove and prevent the formation of plaque or dental biofilm, although studies have shown this effect on caries is limited. While there is no evidence that flossing prevents tooth decay, the practice is still generally recommended.

A toothbrush can be used to remove plaque on accessible surfaces, but not between teeth or inside pits and fissures on chewing surfaces. When used correctly, dental floss removes plaque from areas that could otherwise develop proximal caries but only if the depth of sulcus has not been compromised. Additional aids include interdental brushes, water picks, and mouthwashes. The use of rotational electric toothbrushes might reduce the risk of plaque and gingivitis, though it is unclear whether they are of clinical importance.

However, oral hygiene is effective at preventing gum disease (gingivitis / periodontal disease). Food is forced inside pits and fissures under chewing pressure, leading to carbohydrate-fuelled acid demineralisation where the brush, fluoride toothpaste, and saliva have no access to remove trapped food, neutralise acid, or remineralise tooth enamel. (Occlusal caries accounts for between 80 and 90% of caries in children (Weintraub, 2001).) Unlike brushing, fluoride leads to proven reduction in caries incidence by approximately 25%; higher concentrations of fluoride (&gt;1,000 ppm) in toothpaste also helps prevents tooth decay, with the effect increasing with concentration up to a plateau. A randomized clinical trial demonstrated that toothpastes that contain arginine have greater protection against tooth cavitation than the regular fluoride toothpastes containing 1450 ppm alone. A Cochrane review has confirmed that the use of fluoride gels, normally applied by a dental professional from once to several times a year, assists in the prevention of tooth decay in children and adolescents, reiterating the importance of fluoride as the principal means of caries prevention. Another review concluded that the supervised regular use of a fluoride mouthwash greatly reduced the onset of decay in the permanent teeth of children.

Professional hygiene care consists of regular dental examinations and professional prophylaxis (cleaning). Sometimes, complete plaque removal is difficult, and a dentist or dental hygienist may be needed. Along with oral hygiene, radiographs may be taken at dental visits to detect possible dental caries development in high-risk areas of the mouth (e.g. &quot;bitewing&quot; X-rays which visualize the crowns of the back teeth).

Alternative methods of oral hygiene also exist around the world, such as the use of teeth cleaning twigs such as miswaks in some Middle Eastern and African cultures. There is some limited evidence demonstrating the efficacy of these alternative methods of oral hygiene.

===Dietary modification===
People who eat more free sugars get more cavities, with cavities increasing exponentially with increasing sugar intake. Populations with less sugar intake have fewer cavities. In one population, in Nigeria, where sugar consumption was about 2g/day, only two percent of the population, of any age, had had a cavity.

Chewy and sticky foods (such as candy, cookies, potato chips, and crackers) tend to adhere to teeth longer. However, dried fruits such as raisins and fresh fruit such as apples and bananas disappear from the mouth quickly, and do not appear to be a risk factor. Consumers are not good at guessing which foods stick around in the mouth.

For children, the American Dental Association and the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry recommend limiting the frequency of consumption of drinks with sugar, and not giving baby bottles to infants during sleep (see earlier discussion). Parents are also recommended to avoid sharing utensils and cups with their infants to prevent transferring bacteria from the parent&#x27;s mouth.

Xylitol is a naturally occurring sugar alcohol that is used in different products as an alternative to sucrose (table sugar). As of 2015 the evidence concerning the use of xylitol in chewing gum was insufficient to determine if it is effective at preventing caries.

===Other measures===
The use of dental sealants is a means of prevention. A sealant is a thin plastic-like coating applied to the chewing surfaces of the molars to prevent food from being trapped inside pits and fissures. This deprives resident plaque bacteria of carbohydrate, preventing the formation of pit and fissure caries. Sealants are usually applied on the teeth of children, as soon as the teeth erupt but adults are receiving them if not previously performed. Sealants can wear out and fail to prevent access of food and plaque bacteria inside pits and fissures and need to be replaced so they must be checked regularly by dental professionals. Dental sealants have been shown to be more effective at preventing occlusal decay when compared to fluoride varnish applications.

Calcium, as found in food such as milk and green vegetables, is often recommended to protect against dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent decay of a tooth by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot; is the leading cause of tooth decay. Low concentration fluoride ions act as bacteriostatic therapeutic agent and high concentration fluoride ions are bactericidal. The incorporated fluorine makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and, thus, resistant to decay. Fluoride can be found in either topical or systemic form. Topical fluoride is more highly recommended than systemic intake to protect the surface of the teeth. Topical fluoride is used in toothpaste, mouthwash and fluoride varnish. Standard fluoride toothpaste (1,000–1,500 ppm) is more effective than low fluoride toothpaste (&lt; 600ppm) to prevent dental caries. It is recommended that all adult patients to use fluoridated toothpaste with at least 1350ppm fluoride content, brushing at least 2 times per day and brush right before bed. For children and young adults, use fluoridated toothpaste with 1350ppm to 1500ppm fluoride content, brushing 2 times per day and also brush right before bed. American Dental Association Council suggest that for children &lt;3 years old, caregivers should begin brushing their teeth by using fluoridated toothpaste with an amount no more than a smear. Supervised toothbrushing must also be done to children below 8 years of age to prevent swallowing of toothpaste. After brushing with fluoride toothpaste, rinsing should be avoided and the excess spat out. Many dental professionals include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine visits and recommend the use of xylitol and amorphous calcium phosphate products. Silver diammine fluoride may work better than fluoride varnish to prevent cavities. Systemic fluoride is found as lozenges, tablets, drops and water fluoridation. These are ingested orally to provide fluoride systemically. Water fluoridation has been shown to be beneficial to prevent tooth decay, especially in low social economical areas, where other forms of fluoride is not available. However, a Cochrane systematic review found no evidence to suggest that taking fluoride systemically daily in pregnant women was effective in preventing dental decay in their offspring. While some products containing chlorhexidine have been shown to limit the progression of existing tooth decay; there is currently no evidence suggesting that chlorhexidine gels and varnishes can prevent dental caries or reduce the population of &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot; in the mouth.

An oral health assessment carried out before a child reaches the age of one may help with management of caries. The oral health assessment should include checking the child&#x27;s history, a clinical examination, checking the risk of caries in the child including the state of their occlusion and assessing how well equipped the child&#x27;s parent or carer is to help the child prevent caries. To further increase a child&#x27;s cooperation in caries management, good communication by the dentist and the rest of the staff of a dental practice should be used. This communication can be improved by calling the child by their name, using eye contact and including them in any conversation about their treatment.

Vaccines are also under development.

==Treatment==


Most importantly, whether the carious lesion is cavitated or non-cavitated dictates the management. Clinical assessment of whether the lesion is active or arrested is also important. Noncavitated lesions can be arrested and remineralization can occur under the right conditions. However, this may require extensive changes to the diet (reduction in frequency of refined sugars), improved oral hygiene (toothbrushing twice per day with fluoride toothpaste and daily flossing), and regular application of topical fluoride. More recently, Immunoglobulin Y specific to &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot; has been used to suppress growth of &quot;S. mutans&quot;. Such management of a carious lesion is termed &quot;non-operative&quot; since no drilling is carried out on the tooth. Non-operative treatment requires excellent understanding and motivation from the individual, otherwise the decay will continue.

Once a lesion has cavitated, especially if dentin is involved, remineralization is much more difficult and a dental restoration is usually indicated (&quot;operative treatment&quot;). Before a restoration can be placed, all of the decay must be removed otherwise it will continue to progress underneath the filling. Sometimes a small amount of decay can be left if it is entombed and there is a seal which isolates the bacteria from their substrate. This can be likened to placing a glass container over a candle, which burns itself out once the oxygen is used up. Techniques such as stepwise caries removal are designed to avoid exposure of the dental pulp and overall reduction of the amount of tooth substance which requires removal before the final filling is placed. Often enamel which overlies decayed dentin must also be removed as it is unsupported and susceptible to fracture. The modern decision-making process with regards the activity of the lesion, and whether it is cavitated, is summarized in the table.

Destroyed tooth structure does not fully regenerate, although remineralization of very small carious lesions may occur if dental hygiene is kept at optimal level. For the small lesions, topical fluoride is sometimes used to encourage remineralization. For larger lesions, the progression of dental caries can be stopped by treatment. The goal of treatment is to preserve tooth structures and prevent further destruction of the tooth. Aggressive treatment, by filling, of incipient carious lesions, places where there is superficial damage to the enamel, is controversial as they may heal themselves, while once a filling is performed it will eventually have to be redone and the site serves as a vulnerable site for further decay.

In general, early treatment is quicker and less expensive than treatment of extensive decay. Local anesthetics, nitrous oxide (&quot;laughing gas&quot;), or other prescription medications may be required in some cases to relieve pain during or following treatment or to relieve anxiety during treatment. A dental handpiece (&quot;drill&quot;) is used to remove large portions of decayed material from a tooth. A spoon, a dental instrument used to carefully remove decay, is sometimes employed when the decay in dentin reaches near the pulp. Some dentists remove dental caries using a laser rather than the traditional dental drill. A Cochrane review of this technique looked at Er:YAG (erbium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet), Er,Cr:YSGG (erbium, chromium: yttrium-scandium-gallium-garnet) and Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet) lasers and found that although people treated with lasers (compared to a conventional dental &quot;drill&quot;) experienced less pain and had a lesser need for dental anaesthesia, that overall there was little difference in caries removal. Another alternative to drilling or lasers for small caries is the use of air abrasion, in which small abrasive particles are blasted at decay using pressurized air (similar to sand blasting). Once the decay is removed, the missing tooth structure requires a dental restoration of some sort to return the tooth to function and aesthetic condition.

Restorative materials include dental amalgam, composite resin, glass ionomer cement, porcelain, and gold. Composite resin and porcelain can be made to match the color of a patient&#x27;s natural teeth and are thus used more frequently when aesthetics are a concern. Composite restorations are not as strong as dental amalgam and gold; some dentists consider the latter as the only advisable restoration for posterior areas where chewing forces are great. When the decay is too extensive, there may not be enough tooth structure remaining to allow a restorative material to be placed within the tooth. Thus, a crown may be needed. This restoration appears similar to a cap and is fitted over the remainder of the natural crown of the tooth. Crowns are often made of gold, porcelain, or porcelain fused to metal.

For children, preformed crowns are available to place over the tooth. These are usually made of metal (usually stainless steel but increasingly there are aesthetic materials). Traditionally teeth are shaved down to make room for the crown but, more recently, stainless steel crowns have been used to seal decay into the tooth and stop it progressing. This is known as the Hall Technique and works by depriving the bacteria in the decay of nutrients and making their environment less favorable for them. It is a minimally invasive method of managing decay in children and does not require local anesthetic injections in the mouth.

In certain cases, endodontic therapy may be necessary for the restoration of a tooth. Endodontic therapy, also known as a &quot;root canal&quot;, is recommended if the pulp in a tooth dies from infection by decay-causing bacteria or from trauma. In root canal therapy, the pulp of the tooth, including the nerve and vascular tissues, is removed along with decayed portions of the tooth. The canals are instrumented with endodontic files to clean and shape them, and they are then usually filled with a rubber-like material called gutta percha. The tooth is filled and a crown can be placed. Upon completion of root canal therapy, the tooth is non-vital, as it is devoid of any living tissue.

An extraction can also serve as treatment for dental caries. The removal of the decayed tooth is performed if the tooth is too far destroyed from the decay process to effectively restore the tooth. Extractions are sometimes considered if the tooth lacks an opposing tooth or will probably cause further problems in the future, as may be the case for wisdom teeth. Extractions may also be preferred by people unable or unwilling to undergo the expense or difficulties in restoring the tooth.

Recent studies from the University of Michigan demonstrated that SDF is effective in stopping tooth decay when applied to the teeth of young children. The silver ions in SDF denature bacterial proteins and enzymes, effectively killing cariogenic bacteria such as &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot;. 

==Epidemiology==

Worldwide, approximately 3.6 billion people have dental caries in their permanent teeth. In baby teeth it affects about 620 million people or 9% of the population. The disease is most common in Latin American countries, countries in the Middle East, and South Asia, and least prevalent in China. In the United States, dental caries is the most common chronic childhood disease, being at least five times more common than asthma. It is the primary pathological cause of tooth loss in children. Between 29% and 59% of adults over the age of 50 experience caries.

Treating dental cavities costs 5–10% of health-care budgets in industrialized countries, and can easily exceed budgets in lower-income countries.

The number of cases has decreased in some developed countries, and this decline is usually attributed to increasingly better oral hygiene practices and preventive measures such as fluoride treatment. Nonetheless, countries that have experienced an overall decrease in cases of tooth decay continue to have a disparity in the distribution of the disease. Among children in the United States and Europe, twenty percent of the population endures sixty to eighty percent of cases of dental caries. A similarly skewed distribution of the disease is found throughout the world with some children having none or very few caries and others having a high number. Australia, Nepal, and Sweden (where children receive dental care paid for by the government) have a low incidence of cases of dental caries among children, whereas cases are more numerous in Costa Rica and Slovakia.

The classic DMF (decay/missing/filled) index is one of the most common methods for assessing caries prevalence as well as dental treatment needs among populations. This index is based on in-field clinical examination of individuals by using a probe, mirror and cotton rolls. Because the DMF index is done without X-ray imaging, it underestimates real caries prevalence and treatment needs.

Bacteria typically associated with dental caries have been isolated from vaginal samples from females who have bacterial vaginosis.

==History==
There is a long history of dental caries. Over a million years ago, hominins such as &quot;Paranthropus&quot; had cavities. The largest increases in the prevalence of caries have been associated with dietary changes.

Archaeological evidence shows that tooth decay is an ancient disease dating far into prehistory. Skulls dating from a million years ago through the Neolithic period show signs of caries, including those from the Paleolithic and Mesolithic ages. The increase of caries during the Neolithic period may be attributed to the increased consumption of plant foods containing carbohydrates. The beginning of rice cultivation in South Asia is also believed to have caused an increase in caries especially for women, although there is also some evidence from sites in Thailand, such as Khok Phanom Di, that shows a decrease in overall percentage of dental caries with the increase in dependence on rice agriculture.

A Sumerian text from 5000 BC describes a &quot;tooth worm&quot; as the cause of caries. Evidence of this belief has also been found in India, Egypt, Japan, and China. Unearthed ancient skulls show evidence of primitive dental work. In Pakistan, teeth dating from around 5500 BC to 7000 BC show nearly perfect holes from primitive dental drills. The Ebers Papyrus, an Egyptian text from 1550 BC, mentions diseases of teeth. During the Sargonid dynasty of Assyria during 668 to 626 BC, writings from the king&#x27;s physician specify the need to extract a tooth due to spreading inflammation. In the Roman Empire, wider consumption of cooked foods led to a small increase in caries prevalence. The Greco-Roman civilization, in addition to the Egyptian civilization, had treatments for pain resulting from caries.

The rate of caries remained low through the Bronze Age and Iron Age, but sharply increased during the Middle Ages. Periodic increases in caries prevalence had been small in comparison to the 1000 AD increase, when sugar cane became more accessible to the Western world. Treatment consisted mainly of herbal remedies and charms, but sometimes also included bloodletting. The barber surgeons of the time provided services that included tooth extractions. Learning their training from apprenticeships, these health providers were quite successful in ending tooth pain and likely prevented systemic spread of infections in many cases. Among Roman Catholics, prayers to Saint Apollonia, the patroness of dentistry, were meant to heal pain derived from tooth infection.

There is also evidence of caries increase when Indigenous people in North America changed from a strictly hunter-gatherer diet to a diet with maize. Rates also increased after contact with colonizing Europeans, implying an even greater dependence on maize.

During the European Age of Enlightenment, the belief that a &quot;tooth worm&quot; caused caries was also no longer accepted in the European medical community. Pierre Fauchard, known as the father of modern dentistry, was one of the first to reject the idea that worms caused tooth decay and noted that sugar was detrimental to the teeth and gingiva. In 1850, another sharp increase in the prevalence of caries occurred and is believed to be a result of widespread diet changes. Prior to this time, cervical caries was the most frequent type of caries, but increased availability of sugar cane, refined flour, bread, and sweetened tea corresponded with a greater number of pit and fissure caries.

In the 1890s, W. D. Miller conducted a series of studies that led him to propose an explanation for dental caries that was influential for current theories. He found that bacteria inhabited the mouth and that they produced acids that dissolved tooth structures when in the presence of fermentable carbohydrates. This explanation is known as the chemoparasitic caries theory. Miller&#x27;s contribution, along with the research on plaque by G. V. Black and J. L. Williams, served as the foundation for the current explanation of the etiology of caries. Several of the specific strains of lactobacilli were identified in 1921 by Fernando E. Rodríguez Vargas.

In 1924 in London, Killian Clarke described a spherical bacterium in chains isolated from carious lesions which he called &quot;Streptococcus&quot; &quot;mutans&quot;. Although Clarke proposed that this organism was the cause of caries, the discovery was not followed up. Later, in 1954 in the US, Frank Orland working with hamsters showed that caries was transmissible and caused by acid-producing &quot;Streptococcus&quot; thus ending the debate whether dental caries were resultant from bacteria. It was not until the late 1960s that it became generally accepted that the &quot;Streptococcus&quot; isolated from hamster caries was the same as &quot;S&quot;. &quot;mutans&quot;.

Tooth decay has been present throughout human history, from early hominids millions of years ago, to modern humans. The prevalence of caries increased dramatically in the 19th century, as the Industrial Revolution made certain items, such as refined sugar and flour, readily available. The diet of the &quot;newly industrialized English working class&quot; then became centered on bread, jam, and sweetened tea, greatly increasing both sugar consumption and caries.

===Etymology and usage===

Naturalized from Latin into English (a loanword), &quot;caries&quot; in its English form originated as a mass noun that means &#x27;rottenness&#x27;, that is, &#x27;decay&#x27;. The word is an uncountable noun.

&quot;Cariesology&quot; or &quot;cariology&quot; is the study of dental caries.

==Society and culture==
It is estimated that untreated dental caries results in worldwide productivity losses in the size of about US$27 billion yearly.

==Other animals==

Dental caries are uncommon among companion animals.

<text>A pumpjack is the overground drive for a reciprocating piston pump in an oil well.

It is used to mechanically lift liquid out of the well if there is not enough bottom hole pressure for the liquid to flow all the way to the surface. The arrangement is often used for onshore wells. Pumpjacks are common in oil-rich areas. 

Depending on the size of the pump, it generally produces of liquid at each stroke. Often this is an emulsion of crude oil and water. Pump size is also determined by the depth and weight of the oil to remove, with deeper extraction requiring more power to move the increased weight of the discharge column (discharge head).

A beam-type pumpjack converts the rotary motion of the motor (usually an electric motor) to the vertical reciprocating motion necessary to drive the polished-rod and accompanying sucker rod and column (fluid) load. The engineering term for this type of mechanism is a walking beam. It was often employed in stationary and marine steam engine designs in the 18th and 19th centuries.

==Names==
A pumpjack is also called a beam pump, walking beam pump, horsehead pump, nodding donkey pump (donkey pumper), rocking horse pump, grasshopper pump, sucker rod pump, dinosaur pump, Big Texan pump, thirsty bird pump, hobby horse, or just pumping unit.

==Above ground==
In the early days, pumpjacks worked by rod lines running horizontally above the ground to a wheel on a rotating eccentric in a mechanism known as a central power. The central power, which might operate a dozen or more pumpjacks, would be powered by a steam or internal combustion engine or by an electric motor. Among the advantages of this scheme was only having one prime mover to power all the pumpjacks rather than individual motors for each. However, among the many difficulties was maintaining system balance as individual well loads changed.

Modern pumpjacks are powered by a prime mover. This is commonly an electric motor, but internal combustion engines are used in isolated locations without access to electricity, or, in the cases of water pumpjacks, where three-phase power is not available (while single phase motors exist at least up to , providing power to single-phase motors above can cause powerline problems, notably voltage sag on startup, and many pumps require more than 10 horsepower). Common off-grid pumpjack engines run on natural gas, often casing gas produced from the well, but pumpjacks have been run on many types of fuel, such as propane and diesel fuel. In harsh climates, such motors and engines may be housed in a shack for protection from the elements. Engines that power water pumpjacks often receive natural gas from the nearest available gas grid.

The prime mover runs a set of pulleys to the transmission, often a double-reduction gearbox, which drives a pair of cranks, generally with counterweights installed on them to offset the weight of the heavy rod assembly. The cranks raise and lower one end of an I-beam which is free to move on an A-frame. On the other end of the beam is a curved metal box called a horse head or donkey head, so named due to its appearance. A cable made of steel—occasionally, fibreglass—, called a bridle, connects the horse head to the polished rod, a piston that passes through the stuffing box.

The cranks themselves also produce counterbalance due to their weight, so on pumpjacks that do not carry very heavy loads, the weight of the cranks themselves may be enough to balance the well load.

Sometimes, however, crank-balanced units can become prohibitively heavy due to the need for counterweights. Lufkin Industries offer &quot;air-balanced&quot; units, where counterbalance is provided by a pneumatic cylinder charged with air from a compressor, eliminating the need for counterweights.

The polished rod has a close fit to the stuffing box, letting it move in and out of the tubing without fluid escaping. (The tubing is a pipe that runs to the bottom of the well through which the liquid is produced.) The bridle follows the curve of the horse head as it lowers and raises to create a vertical or nearly-vertical stroke. The polished rod is connected to a long string of rods called sucker rods, which run through the tubing to the down-hole pump, usually positioned near the bottom of the well.

==Down-hole==
At the bottom of the tubing is the down-hole pump. This pump has two ball check valves: a stationary valve at bottom called the standing valve, and a valve on the piston connected to the bottom of the sucker rods that travels up and down as the rods reciprocate, known as the traveling valve. Reservoir fluid enters from the formation into the bottom of the borehole through perforations that have been made through the casing and cement (the casing is a larger metal pipe that runs the length of the well, which has cement placed between it and the earth; the tubing, pump, and sucker rod are all inside the casing).

When the rods at the pump end are travelling up, the traveling valve is closed and the standing valve is open (due to the drop in pressure in the pump barrel). Consequently, the pump barrel fills with the fluid from the formation as the traveling piston lifts the previous contents of the barrel upwards. When the rods begin pushing down, the traveling valve opens and the standing valve closes (due to an increase in pressure in the pump barrel). The traveling valve drops through the fluid in the barrel (which had been sucked in during the upstroke). The piston then reaches the end of its stroke and begins its path upwards again, repeating the process.

Often, gas is produced through the same perforations as the oil. This can be problematic if gas enters the pump, because it can result in what is known as gas locking, where insufficient pressure builds up in the pump barrel to open the valves (due to compression of the gas) and little or nothing is pumped. To preclude this, the inlet for the pump can be placed below the perforations. As the gas-laden fluid enters the well bore through the perforations, the gas bubbles up the annulus (the space between the casing and the tubing) while the liquid moves down to the standing valve inlet. Once at the surface, the gas is collected through piping connected to the annulus.

==Water well pumpjacks==
Pumpjacks can also be used to drive what would now be considered old-fashioned hand-pumped water wells. The scale of the technology is frequently smaller than for an oil well, and can typically fit on top of an existing hand-pumped well head. The technology is simple, typically using a parallel-bar double-cam lift driven from a low-power electric motor, although the number of pumpjacks with stroke lengths and longer being used as water pumps is increasing. A short video recording of such a pump in action can be viewed on YouTube.

Although the flow rate for a water well pumpjack is lower than that from a jet pump and the lifted water is not pressurised, the beam pumping unit has the option of hand pumping in an emergency, by hand-rotating the pumpjack cam to its lowest position, and attaching a manual handle to the top of the wellhead rod. In larger pumpjacks powered by engines, the engine can run off fuel stored in a reservoir or from natural gas delivered from the nearest gas grid. In some cases, this type of pump consumes less power than a jet pump and is, therefore, cheaper to run.

<doc id="414353" wikidata="Q4832439" url="?curid=414353" title="2003 Azerbaijani presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in Azerbaijan on 15 October 2003. As expected, Ilham Aliyev, son of the outgoing president, Heydar Aliyev, was officially elected with an overwhelming majority in a vote international observers deemed not to be free or fair.

The election was characterized by ballot stuffing and manipulated voter lists. The final vote tabulation was kept from OSCE/ODIHR monitors, which meant that they could not judge the accuracy of the results. Police arrested members of electoral commissions who refused to sign paperwork on vote counts from their precincts. The opposition claimed that Gambar had won the election. The opposition protested against the election results, with the Aliyev regime arresting hundreds, including Gambar.

==Conduct==
Human Rights Watch stated that the &quot;election campaign... from the beginning was heavily manipulated by the government to favor Prime Minister Ilham Aliyev, son of President Heydar Aliyev. The government ensured that election commissions would be stacked to favor Aliyev, and banned nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) from monitoring the vote. As the election drew nearer, government officials openly sided with Ilham Aliyev, obstructed opposition rallies, and sought to limit participation in them. Police have beaten and arbitrarily detained hundreds of opposition activists, including a 73-year-old woman.&quot;

The Institute for Democracy in Eastern Europe provided 188 election observers. The mission, requested by the United States government, formed part of a larger group of observers monitoring under the auspices of the OSCE. The IDEE observers observed more than 1,000 voting precincts and Constituency Election Centers where votes were tabulated, and collectively issued a &quot;Votum Separatum,&quot; which expressed their outrage at election fraud, intimidation and political repression they witnessed during their observation mission and their disagreement with the OSCE&#x27;s mild preliminary report calling the elections &quot;generally well administered.&quot;

<doc id="414354" wikidata="Q768907" url="?curid=414354" title="Spirits of St. Louis">
<text>The Spirits of St. Louis were a basketball franchise based in St. Louis that played in the American Basketball Association (ABA) from 1974 to 1976. This was the third and last city of a franchise that had begun as a charter member in 1967 as the Houston Mavericks before a shift to the Carolinas in 1969 to play as the Cougars. They were one of two teams still in existence at the end of the ABA that did not survive the league&#x27;s merger with the National Basketball Association (NBA). They were a member of the ABA in its last two seasons, 1974–75 and 1975–76, while playing their home games at St. Louis Arena. Under terms of the ABA–NBA merger, the owners of the Spirits continued to receive a portion of NBA television revenue until 2014, when a revised agreement was reached with the league.

== History ==
The Spirits (who took their name from the Atlantic Ocean-crossing plane flown by Charles Lindbergh) were the third incarnation of a franchise that began as the Houston Mavericks and later the Carolina Cougars. However, only a few players from the 1973–74 Cougars followed the team to St. Louis, so the Spirits were essentially an expansion team. By that time, St. Louis was six years removed from NBA basketball, having lost the Hawks to Atlanta after the 1967-68 season.

The Spirits were a colorful team featuring a number of players, both on and off the court, who were fairly successful in their basketball careers. Among them were Moses Malone, acquired during their second and final season, who went on to a long and successful career in the NBA, culminating in enshrinement in the Basketball Hall of Fame. Maurice Lucas spent most of his time in the ABA as a Spirit, then later became an all-star in the NBA with the Portland Trail Blazers. Other well-known players that played for the team included former Boston Celtics sixth man Don Chaney, future Celtics head coach M. L. Carr, and Ron Boone, who held the record for consecutive games played in pro basketball for many years. One of the most colorful players on the team was forward Marvin Barnes, famous for stories about his off-court behavior and lack of understanding of time zones.

A couple of off-court personalities from the team became well known as well. One of the coaches in 1975 was former NBA player Rod Thorn, who became the NBA&#x27;s vice president of basketball operations (in essence, the league&#x27;s chief disciplinarian and the number-two man behind commissioner David Stern) for a number of years. On radio, the team featured Bob Costas as its play-by-play announcer on KMOX. Costas would go on to a highly successful career working for NBC television and radio.

After a slow start in their inaugural season, 1974–75, the Spirits reached the playoffs with a late rush, then upset the defending ABA champion New York Nets in the first round of the playoffs. But the team squandered this good start the following year. Despite inheriting several players (including Malone) from the Utah Stars after that franchise failed in the middle of the season, the Spirits finished well out of playoff contention in 1975–76. Attendance in St. Louis fell through the floor; they were lucky to draw crowds of more than 1,000 people in an 18,000-seat arena, and frequently drew crowds in the hundreds. At season&#x27;s end, negotiations were under way to move the franchise to Salt Lake City, Utah as the Utah Rockies.

==NBA merger==

In the summer of 1976, with the ABA at the point of financial collapse, the six surviving franchises (the Virginia Squires went bankrupt immediately after the final season) began negotiating a merger with the NBA, but the senior circuit decided to accept only four teams from the rival league: the Nets (the last ABA champion), Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers and San Antonio Spurs.

The NBA placated John Y. Brown, owner of the Kentucky Colonels, by giving him a $3.3 million settlement in exchange for shutting his team down. (Brown later used much of that money to buy the Buffalo Braves of the NBA.) The owners of the Spirits, the brothers Ozzie and Daniel Silna, struck a prescient deal to acquire future television money from the teams that joined the NBA, a 1/7 share from each surviving ABA franchise (or nearly 2% of the entire NBA&#x27;s TV money), &quot;in perpetuity&quot;. (The deal allocated 45% for each of the Silnas and 10% for their lawyer Donald Scupak, who brokered the deal. Ozzie died in 2016.) With network TV deals becoming more and more lucrative, the deal has made the Silnas wealthy, earning them $186 million as of 2008, according to the Cleveland &quot;Plain Dealer&quot;, and $255 million as of 2012 according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. (The NBA nearly succeeded in buying out the Silnas in 1982 by offering $5 million over eight years, but negotiations stalled when the siblings demanded $8 million over five.) On June 27, 2007, it was extended for another eight years, ensuring another $100 million+ windfall for the Silnas. In 2014, the Silnas reached agreement with the NBA to greatly reduce the perpetual payments and take a lump sum of $500 million. In the last few years before the lump sum agreement, the Silnas were receiving $14.57 million a year, despite being owners of a team that hadn&#x27;t played a game in over 40 years. (The Silnas will, however, still be receiving a now much smaller portion of the television revenue through a new partnership with the former ABA teams the Nets, Nuggets, Pacers and Spurs.)

==Documentary==
On October 8, 2013, ESPN presented a documentary about the team, &quot;Free Spirits&quot;, as part of its &quot;30 for 30&quot; series. Part of the show contained the fact that the Silnas had been suing the NBA for &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars more&quot; they feel the NBA owes them, presumably for NBA League Pass subscriptions and streaming video (the Silnas dropped the suit when the NBA bought their rights out). As a result, – and on the advice of their attorneys – the Silnas refused to be interviewed for the program, directed by Daniel Forer. However, many players, members of management, and Costas – among others – shared their memories of the franchise.

<doc id="414357" wikidata="Q15052201" url="?curid=414357" title="Thunder Force (video game)">
<text>is a multidirectional scrolling shooter released by Technosoft in 1983. It is the first game in the &quot;Thunder Force&quot; series. It was initially published for the X1 computer, then for the Sharp MZ-1500, PC-6001 mkII, and in 1985 on the PC-8801 mkII. In 1984, it was released for the FM-7 and PC-9801 computers as &quot;Thunder Force Construction&quot;, featuring an add-on that allowed players to create custom areas, like a level editor or game creation system.

==Gameplay==
The structure of the game consists of overhead, free-directional scrolling areas and the player&#x27;s ship is armed with main shot to shoot airborne targets and a bomb shot to shoot ground enemies. Gameplay consists of flying the FIRE LEO over ORN occupied areas while destroying enemy base installations and turrets. Each area has a certain number of shield generators hidden under the ground-based, enemy targets; in order for an area to be completed, the shield generators must be found and destroyed. After doing so, the Dyradeizer will temporally appear and the player must destroy a certain section of it. Once this section is destroyed, the Dyradeizer will disappear and the player will be taken to the next area to repeat the process.

==Plot==
The ORN Empire (antagonists of the game) has built a large asteroid fortress named the Dyradeizer to oppose the Galaxy Federation. In addition to its high firepower capabilities, Dyradeizer is supported by shield generators hidden in various locations by ORN, which render the fortress invisible. In an attempt to destroy Dyradeizer, the Galaxy Federation sends their specially designed fighter, the FIRE LEO (controlled by the player), to locate and destroy the shield generators and defeat Dyradeizer.

==Development==
The original &quot;Thunder Force&quot; was created by Kotori Yoshimura in 1983. She later left Technosoft and founded Arsys Software in 1985. In 1984, Technosoft released a level editor, or game creation system, entitled &quot;Thunder Force Construction&quot;, created by Yoshimura for the FM-7 computer.

==Legacy==
The success of the game led to a number of sequels in the &quot;Thunder Force&quot; series.

<doc id="414360" wikidata="Q65122097" url="?curid=414360" title="Lindus">
<text>Lindus or Lindos () was one of the most important towns in ancient Rhodes.

==History==
It was situated on the eastern coast, a little to the north of a promontory bearing the same name. The district was in ancient times very productive in wine and figs, though otherwise it was very barren.

===Late Bronze===
In the Catalogue of Ships in the &quot;Iliad&quot; of Homer, Lindus, together with the two other Rhodian cities, Ialysus and Camirus, are said to have taken part in the war against Troy.

===Iron Age===
Their inhabitants were Dorians, and formed the three Dorian tribes of the island, Lindus itself being one of the Doric Hexapolis in the south-west of Asia Minor. 

Previous to the year 408 BCE, when the city of Rhodes was built, Lindus, like the other cities, formed a little state by itself, but when Rhodes was founded, a great part of the population and the common government was transferred to the new city. Lindus, however, though it lost its political importance, still retained religious importance, for it contained two ancient and much revered sanctuaries – one of Athena, hence called the Lindian, and the other of Heracles. The former was believed to have been built by Danaus, or, according to others by his daughters on their flight from Egypt. The temple of Heracles was remarkable, according to Lactantius (Div.Inst. 1.21.31-37), on account of the vituperative and injurious language with which the worship was conducted. This temple contained a painting of Heracles by Parrhasius; and Lindus appears to have possessed several other paintings by the same artist.

Lindus also was the native place of Cleobulus, one of the Seven Sages of Greece; and Athenaeus has preserved a pretty poem ascribed to Cleobulus, and which the Lindian boys used to sing as they went round collecting money for the return of the swallows in spring.

Strabo&#x27;s description of Lindus as &quot;on the side of a hill, looking towards the south and Alexandria,&quot; cannot be mistaken; and the modern town of Lindos is exactly the spot occupied by the ancient Dorian city.

<text>American President Lines, LLC (APL, formerly American President Lines Ltd.), is an American container shipping company that is a subsidiary of French shipping company CMA CGM. It operates an all-container ship fleet, including nine U.S. flagged container vessels.

In 1938, the U.S. government took over the management of the Dollar Steamship Co., which was in financial difficulties and transferred their assets to the newly formed American President Lines. In 1997, Singaporean shipping company Neptune Orient Lines (NOL) acquired APL, eventually moving APL&#x27;s headquarters to Singapore. In 2016, CMA CGM acquired NOL, parent company of APL.

==History==

===Pacific Mail Steamship Company===
Following the end of the Mexican–American War in 1848, the West Coast of the United States then extended from Puget Sound to San Diego. When the 29th United States Congress passed the Mail Steamer Bill (1847), mail delivery was authorized to be routed by ship from the East Coast of the United States to the Pacific Coast via the Isthmus of Panama, with two steamship routes operating: New York City to Chagres, Colombia on the Eastern side of the isthmus, and then a second route from Panama City, Colombia, to Astoria, Oregon. That same year, William Henry Aspinwall secured a 10-year government contract through Arnold Harris, with the Pacific Mail Steamship Company incorporating in the state of New York with a capital of $400,000, of which Aspinwall was elected the first president. This company was to move the mail from Panama to the West Coast, being paid $199,000 per annum by the U.S. government. In January 1848, the company ordered three mail steamers from the shipyard of William Henry Webb: the SS &quot;California&quot;, SS &quot;Panama&quot; and SS &quot;Oregon&quot;. On October 5 or October 6, 1848 the Pacific Mail&#x27;s first of these steamers, the SS &quot;California&quot;, departed from New York City to run service from Panama to the West Coast, traveling around Cape Horn to San Francisco—coincidentally, the California Gold Rush began in January of that year, and the steamer—and its sisters, &quot;Oregon&quot; and &quot;Panama&quot;—took on many hopeful miners en route.
Prior to founding Pacific Mail, Aspinwall had extensive experience in the shipping business as a partner in Howland &amp; Aspinwall. Howland &amp; Aspinwall operated some of the most famous clipper ships ever built. In 1845, while it already owned the &quot;Ann McKim&quot;, which was regarded as the fastest ship afloat, the firm built the &quot;Rainbow&quot;, which was even faster. The &quot;Rainbow&quot; is considered to be the first of the extreme clippers, which were the racehorses of the sea. The next year, the company had the &quot;Sea Witch&quot; built, which set a speed record from China to New York that still stands.

Clipper ships sacrificed cargo capacity for speed, but in some markets, the fast service allowed their owners to charge premium rates (e.g. tea from China tasted better if it was fresh, so the cargo on the first ship of the season to arrive in New York was worth more). Also, faster speed meant that the vessel could complete more voyages in a given time period, which compensated for the diminished cargo capacity.

When in 1850, the Pacific Mail Steamship Company established a competing line to the U.S. Mail Steamship Company between New York City and Chagres, George Law placed an opposition Pacific Line of steamers (SS &quot;Antelope&quot;, SS &quot;Columbus&quot;, SS &quot;Isthmus&quot;, SS &quot;Republic&quot;) in the Pacific running from Panama City to San Francisco. In April 1851 the rivalry was ended when an agreement was made between the companies, the U.S. Mail Steamship Company purchased the Pacific Mail steamers on the Atlantic side (SS &quot;Crescent City&quot;, SS &quot;Empire City&quot;, SS &quot;Philadelphia&quot;), and George Law sold his ships and new line to the Pacific Mail.

By 1850 Pacific Mail maintained a monopoly over the Panama-Oregon trade, helped by the purchase of two steamers from Empire City Line. Large numbers of prospective gold miners paying for passage to California had meant that by 1850, the capital of Pacific Mail had increased from $400,000 to over $2 million. Pacific Mail also ordered four new ships, designed to meet the needs of trade to and from California, and opened ship depots at Panama City and Benicia, California. Aspinwall invested in the Panama Railroad Company, which would replace old wagon trails across the Isthmus, cutting travel time from four days to four hours. In 1852 George Law went into partnership with Aspinwall and developed its eastern terminal next to the wharf at Aspinwall, Columbia, then sold his interest in 1853. This line was completed in 1855, and coordination between steamships and this line meant the travel time from San Francisco to New York was cut to 21 days.

In 1856, Aspinwall retired from the position of president of the Pacific Mail Company, with the former secretary, William H. Davidge, taking the presidency. Under his control, the company&#x27;s capital doubled, to $4 million, but the major turning point of his presidency of the company was in 1858, when Pacific Mail&#x27;s contract with the government expired. At the same time, the contract of the U.S. Mail Steamship Company also expired. This company had been providing the ships for the New York to Panama route and went out of business in 1859. A through service was deemed necessary (and profitable), and the company bought three new ships: the SS &quot;Adriatic&quot;, SS &quot;Atlantic&quot; and SS &quot;Baltic&quot;, all of which had formerly belonged to Collins Line. Competition from the other Atlantic steamship lines was fierce, however, and within a few years, the route on the Atlantic side was pulled.

During the American Civil War (1861–65), Pacific Mail used its steamers to transport gold to the East Coast to support the Northern cause. The company also received the SS &quot;Colorado&quot;, launched from the same shipyard as the SS &quot;California&quot;. By the end of the war (1865), under the new presidency, Pacific Mail purchased its competitor, Atlantic Mail Steamship Company, which at this point was providing service from New York to the Isthmus. This in turn meant that, at last, Pacific Mail was able to provide complete service from New York to the West Coast via the Isthmus, without competition.

In 1866, the Federal government of the United States awarded the first mail contract of $500,000 per annum between San Francisco and the Far East — namely Hong Kong via Japan and the Sandwich Islands (later known as the Hawaiian Islands)—to Pacific Mail. The SS &quot;Colorado&quot; was pulled from the original New York–San Francisco route to be used on the new route from San Francisco to China and Japan. The &quot;Colorado&quot; was outfitted with a mizzen mast and more coal storage for the voyage, and in 1867, became the first steamship to run a regular service across the Pacific Ocean, running from San Francisco to Yokohama, Japan and onward to Hong Kong. Pacific Mail also ordered four new ships to run on this route: the SS &quot;China&quot;, SS &quot;Japan&quot;, SS &quot;Great Republic&quot; and SS &quot;America.&quot; These ships were ordered at a cost of $1 million, and the capital of the company was increased to $20 million to cover this cost.

By 1867, the company was running four different lines:
#The &quot;Atlantic Line&quot;, between New York and Aspinwall, Panama. This ran thrice monthly.
#The &quot;Pacific Line&quot;, which linked with the &quot;Atlantic Line&quot;, which ran between Panama and San Francisco, stopping at Acapulco and Manzanillo. This route also ran thrice monthly, except for the latter, which ran once monthly.
#The &quot;China Line&quot;, between San Francisco and Hong Kong, stopping at Yokohama. This ran once monthly. This linked with the &quot;Pacific Line.&quot;
#The &quot;Shanghai Line&quot;, which ran between Yokohama and Shanghai, via Nagasaki. This also ran once monthly, linking with the &quot;China Line&quot;.
Through these links, freight could be moved from New York to Yokohama in 42 days, to Shanghai in 47 days and Hong Kong in 50 days, including all detentions. In this same year, the company owned 25 ships, with a combined tonnage of 61,474 tons.

In 1869, the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad meant that the passenger traffic on the Panama route declined. In 1872, the U.S. government doubled the subsidy on mail transported by Pacific Mail, although it required the doubling of service and the modernization of the fleet. Therefore, in 1873, Pacific Mail took delivery of the first of 11 iron–hulled, screw-powered steamships, the &quot;City of Peking.&quot; In 1875, William Henry Aspinwall, died on January 18 at the age of 68, but Pacific Mail continued on, and soon began service to Australia and New Zealand.

During the 1880s Pacific Mail modernized its ships with steel hulls, replacing the old iron vessels, and installed electric lighting by Thomas Edison on the SS &quot;Columbia&quot;, making it the first ship to have electrical power in the world. In 1893, the Southern Pacific Co. acquired control over the Pacific Mail. In 1902, Pacific Mail launched the SS &quot;Korea&quot; and SS &quot;Siberia&quot;, which were its first steel-hulled ships, followed by SS &quot;Manchuria&quot; and SS &quot;Mongolia&quot; in 1904. These ships were the largest and fastest passenger-freight ships in the Pacific, the latter two measuring more than 13,600 gross tons, larger than any other ship the company owned at the time.

In 1912, Congress banned ships owned by railroads from using the Panama Canal, and so Pacific Mail was sold to W. R. Grace and Company, where it operated as a subsidiary from 1916 till 1925, when the company&#x27;s trans-Pacific fleet was bought over by the Dollar Shipping Company for $5,625,000 in cash.

===Dollar Shipping Company===
Meanwhile, Captain Robert Dollar purchased his first ship, marking the beginning of his shipping empire. Dollar was born in Falkirk, Scotland in 1844, moving to Canada at the age of 11, where he worked in a lumber camp. Following this, in 1893, he purchased his own sawmill on the Pacific Coast. Due to unreliable shipping timetables, he found it hard to ship his lumber from the Pacific Northwest down the coast towards California. Hence, in 1893 Dollar bought a steam schooner called ‘’Newsboy’’. This led to the establishment of the ‘’’Dollar Steamship Company’’’ (commonly known as “Dollar Line”) on August 12, 1900, which soon grew to have a large fleet of schooners transporting lumber to market.
In 1902, Dollar sailed to Asia for the first time on a Pacific Mail ship, SS ‘’China’’, to prospect potential lumber markets on the other side of the Pacific. He began to acquire a number of ships, and began his trans-Pacific shipping with a chartered voyage to Yokohama, Japan and the Philippines, marking his entry into international shipping. During World War I, Dollar ordered the construction of $30 million worth of ships in China, and in 1923 bought seven “502 President Type” liners from the U.S. Shipping Board, pioneering his round-the-world service, marked by the departure of on January 5, 1924. These were all named after U.S. presidents, a tradition that Dollar Shipping continued until its end.

This was followed up in 1925 by the purchase of eight more “535 President Type” liners from the Shipping Board, which had previously been run by Pacific Mail. Dollar Shipping bid much lower than Pacific Mail for the ships—on the order of $1 million—but Pacific Mail’s offer included stocks as well as cash. Thus, the Shipping Board declared that Pacific Mail was unable to meet the terms of tender, and awarded $30 million worth of ships to Dollar Shipping. This naturally caused troubles for Pacific Mail, and it was taken over by Dollar Shipping the same year, although Dollar had ordered his sons to begin buying stock of the company in 1920. In 1922 the Dollar Line also acquired the Admiral Oriental Line and renamed it the American Mail Line, making Dollar one of the most profitable shipping companies in the world.

Dollar Line continued expanding its business in the late 1920s, buying five more “535 President Type” ships in 1926. In that year, Dollar Line carried over 45,000 passengers and had a gross revenue of $6 million. Dollar encouraged others to invest in Asia with his booklet, “Have You Investigated the Oriental Market for Your Product?”, helping to open up Asia to 20th-century industry. The Merchant Marine Act of 1928 (also known as the Jones–White act) also helped Dollar Line, allowing it to sign a lucrative new mail contract and requiring it to build new ships to meet demand.

On October 26, 1929, just as the Wall Street Crash of 1929 was beginning, Dollar Steamship Line (renamed that same year) ordered two steam turbo-electric ocean liners—the largest yet built for a US shipping company. was completed in 1930 and was completed in 1931. They were state-of-the-art, luxurious sister ships rivaling the best hotels of the era, but by then the Great Depression had deepened and the ships carried only half their capacity on their maiden voyages.

On May 16, 1932, Robert Dollar died at the age of 88 and was succeeded by his son, Robert Stanley Dollar. The company began a steady decline. The faltering Dollar companies were now faced with sharply increased operating costs. In December 1937 ‘’President Hoover’’ ran aground off the east coast of Taiwan, and was written off as a constructive total loss. By 1938 The company was $7 million in debt, with interest increasing this by $80,000 per day. In June 1938 ‘’President Coolidge’’ was arrested (seized under admiralty law) in San Francisco for a £35,000 unpaid debt.

===American President Lines===
In August 1938, the United States Maritime Commission judged the Dollar Shipping Company unsound and assumed control over it, appointing William Gibbs McAdoo to succeed R. Stanley Dollar and Joseph R. Sheehan as the new president of the line. The first item of business was an amendment to the corporate charter, renaming the line as &quot;American President Lines&quot;. American Mail Line was also sold to tobacco magnate Richard J. Reynolds and reorganized as an independent company. With that the Dollar Steamship, a long potent force in American shipping, became part of maritime history.

By 1940, the U.S. government had commissioned 16 new ships for APL, continuing the &quot;president&quot; naming of ships, one of these examples being SS &quot;President Jackson&quot;, a C-3 class merchant vessel. In 1941, the U.S. entered World War II, and in 1942 the War Shipping Administration was created, of which APL was an agent. APL worked on the management of some of the Administration&#x27;s ships, maintaining and overhauling them as well as crewing them and being responsible for the handling of cargo and passengers. APL&#x27;s own ships were used, in addition to the many Liberty and Victory ships that were built. In 1944, an additional 16 ships were built specifically for APL, including SS &quot;President Buchanan&quot;, a Victory class vessel. At the end of the war in 1945, the company&#x27;s assets were valued at $40 million.

One of the APL ships in World War II still survives. is a Victory ship that is preserved as a museum ship in the San Pedro area of Los Angeles, California. As a rare surviving Victory ship, she is a U.S. National Historic Landmark. The &quot;Lane Victory&quot; was built by the California Shipbuilding Corporation in Los Angeles, California and launched on 31 May 1945.

In 1945, R. Stanley Dollar, son of Robert Dollar, initiated court proceedings in the form of the Dollar case, in an attempt to force the return of the company from the government to his family. This case would last seven years, with the government continuing the operation of APL in the meantime. APL restarted its round-the-world passenger service, and launched the and the next year, which were advertised as &quot;your American hotel abroad.&quot; In the 1950s, the company again expanded, building more ships; 11 were built between 1952 and 1954. These included C-4 class cargo ships. Also, a settlement was finally reached in the Dollar case. Rather than the Dollar family taking back the company, it was sold to a group of investors led by Ralph K. Davies for $18.3 million. At this time Davies also acquired control of American Mail Line with the aim of reintegrating it into APL.

In 1958, the company began investigating the possibility of containerization, and sent research teams into 28 major ports. Following their reports, Davies began integrating containers into the company&#x27;s business. By 1961, the company had begun launching ships capable of container transport, the first two of these being the combination break-bulk - container vessels SS &quot;President Tyler&quot; and SS &quot;President Lincoln&quot;. Ports also began adapting to the new container-based system, although many potential customers were still wary. By the end of the decade, the company was still launching combination ships rather than fully cellular container ships as already employed by several U.S., British, European and Japanese lines, yet by 1969, 23% of the company&#x27;s business moved via container.
The increasing use of air travel meant that the company&#x27;s passenger services had steadily been declining throughout the 1960s, and by 1973, the last APL liner, the SS &quot;President Wilson&quot;, completed her final round-the-world trip and was sold off. Also in 1973, American Mail Line was fully absorbed into APL, and its ships were subsequently given traditional &quot;President&quot; names. By 1971, the use of containers had again increased; 58% of the company&#x27;s business moved via container. During the early 1970s, the company converted many of its traditional break-bulk freight and combination ships into more efficient container-only ships, and ordered four new-built container ships. In 1977, however, the line pulled back from worldwide freight service to focus on purely trans-Pacific routes. In 1978, the company began work on the concept of seamless integrated intermodal service in the U.S. market: the idea of moving containerized goods via ship, train and truck under one company identity. By 1979, APL started the LinerTrain, a direct rail land-bridge service transporting containers from Los Angeles to New York using its own rail cars, leading to the most reliable delivery of containers of the time. At the same time, the company built its three largest vessels to date: three C-9 class diesel-powered container ships, the first of which was the &quot;President Lincoln&quot;.

In 1984, the company started StackTrain service, an idea following on from the successful LinerTrain venture. This involved using double-stack rail cars that could carry containers stacked one on top of another rather than carrying just a single level of containers. Each rail car had a well that held the bottom container, thereby lowering the two stacked containers to reduce their combined height to fit within rail line clearances, hence the common name for double stack cars: &quot;well cars.&quot; Double-stacking containers in well cars was developed in the late 1970s and first deployed in 1981, but APL was the first shipping line to fully embrace and exploit the concept. APL&#x27;s cars were developed and manufactured by Thrall Car, while line-haul rail service was initially provided by the Union Pacific Railroad and Chicago and North Western Railway, and eventually by Conrail once track clearances were enlarged.

Double-stacking containers greatly improved operating efficiency by reducing train length and the number of axles per container, thus saving fuel per ton-mile. Another benefit was created by permanently joining five cars in a set. This reduced the number of couplers, which reduced slack action. Slack is created in any train by the couplers between the cars being stretched and compressed, and in long, heavy trains this can be quite a powerful force. By reducing slack action, the damage caused to the freight transported in containers is also reduced.

At the same time, the company continued to modernize its fleet, with ever-larger and faster ships, all of which were outfitted for container transport. APL also started a door-to-door service, known as the Red Eagle service. Another initiative was to introduce larger container sizes: containers in 1982, containers in 1985 and containers in 1988. Also in 1988, the company developed post-Panamax vessels, those too large to transit the Panama Canal. These ships were long and wide, with the ability to carry 4,300 TEUs, a TEU being an arbitrary container unit long. All these developments led APL to be declared an industry leader in 1989, with the award of the &quot;Admiral of the Ocean Sea Award&quot; by the United Seamen&#x27;s Service to the president, W. Bruce Seaton.

 The 1990s were a period of continued growth for APL. It still clung to the tradition of naming ships after U.S. presidents, and it had a fleet of 20 fully containerized ships at this point with a combined capacity of 20,000 TEUs. In 1990, APL had a special request for Union Pacific 3985 to pull a 143-car doublestack train between Cheyenne, Wyoming and North Platte, Nebraska. In 1991, APL started stack train service from Chicago to Mexico, serving Chrysler auto plants, as well as providing general service. The company also invested heavily in information technology, using this to keep track of its ever-growing fleet of trains, containers and ships. This has been continually upgraded ever since.
In 1993, the company continued to increase its revenues, and entered a 30-year agreement with the Port of Los Angeles to open a new terminal, at a cost of $70 million. The next year, it almost doubled the size of its Seattle terminal as well, increasing it from to 160. The company became the first shipper to open a website in 1995, and offered online shipment transactions. In 1997, the company was bought by Neptune Orient Lines for $285 million, at a cost of $33.50 per share. In 1998, the APL vessel APL CHINA encountered a storm south of the Aleutian Islands. The losses to the cargo, with 388 containers going overboard and many others damaged as well as damage to the ship, initiated $50 million in lawsuit claims against APL. This may have been the largest maritime shipping loss in history.

In 1999, the stack train franchise was sold off to Pacer, and is now known as Pacer Stacktrain. In the new millennium, the company&#x27;s business began to falter. In 2001, parent company NOL reported losses of $57 million, followed by an amazing loss of $330 million in 2002. At this same time, APL&#x27;s sales dropped from $3.8 billion in 2000 to $3.4 billion in 2002. Acting CEO Ron Widdows began a campaign of cost cutting and sped up decision making, and since 2003, the company has been making money again. In 2005, the company introduced the &quot;Real-Time Locating System&quot; using RFID tags, which accurately recorded the position of every container within the system, reducing delays and lost containers—APL&#x27;s Global Gateway South terminal in Los Angeles now moves 1.65 million TEUs annually.

In 2009, APL and other Neptune Orient business moved to a new headquarters in Singapore. Previously, APL had been based in Oakland, California.

On June 10, 2016, APL and NOL became subsidiaries of CMA-CGM when over 90% of Singapore stocks were purchased by the container line. Later that year, CMA CGM subsidiary U.S. Lines as well as the transpacific business of ANL was consolidated into APL.

In November 2016, the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department seized a shipment of nine Terrex APC vehicles, along with other equipment, belonging to the Singapore Armed Forces at the Kwai Tsing Container Terminal (formerly Kwai Chung Container Terminal). The shipment was seized because APL, which had been engaged by the Singapore military to handle the shipment, did not have the appropriate permits for the vehicles and equipment. In January 2017, it was announced that Hong Kong Customs would be returning the military equipment to Singapore, and that APL would be working with the Hong Kong authorities to ship the vehicles and related equipment back to Singapore. Commissioner of the Customs and Excise Department, Roy Tang Yun-kwong, added that APL would likely face criminal charges for breaching Hong Kong Law in this incident. In 2019, American President Lines and the captain of the involved ship was charged with violating the Import and Export (Strategic Commodities) Regulations, which they both pleaded not guilty to. In April 2019, they were found guilty, with American President Lines sentenced to 90,000 HKD in fines (10,000 HKD for each vehicle), and the captain sentenced to 9,000 HKD in fines (1,000 HKD for each vehicle) and 3 months of jail time (suspended for 1.5 years).

In January 2017, container ship &quot;APL Denver&quot; collided with &quot;Wan Hai 301&quot;, a ship belonging to Singapore, off Pasir Gudang Port in Johor, Malaysia. The accident occurred because &quot;APL Denver&quot; had crossed the path of &quot;Wan Hai 301&quot; while it was moving through the separation scheme. &quot;APL Denver&quot; was heavily damaged, with at least 300 tonnes of oil spilled into the water near Pasir Gudang Port.

Since October 2020, APL has focused exclusively on U.S. Government business - leaving CMA CGM as the sole brand in the transpacific.

<text>Golden Yeggs is a 1950 Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; short directed by Friz Freleng. The cartoon was released on August 5, 1950, and stars Daffy Duck and Porky Pig. A forerunner of the Rocky and Mugsy characters appear, with Rocky already in his present-day form.

The story was written by Tedd Pierce and animated by Arthur Davis, Gerry Chiniquy, Ken Champin, Virgil Ross and Emery Hawkins. Paul Julian painted the backgrounds and Hawley Pratt designed the layouts. Mel Blanc provided the voices and Carl W. Stalling the music.

&quot;Yegg&quot; is a slang term for a burglar or safecracker. The same play-on-words was used in the title of the 1947 Bugs Bunny cartoon, &quot;Easter Yeggs&quot;. It is also a film noir parody.

== Plot ==
When Porky finds a golden egg in his henhouse, a goose reveals to the audience that he laid it. However, knowing full well what happened to the goose that laid the golden egg (a reference to Aesop&#x27;s Fables), the goose tells Porky that Daffy is responsible. After reading about how much Daffy is worth, Rocky and his gang strong-arm Porky and &#x27;talk him into&#x27; selling the duck to them. They hustle Daffy back to their den where Rocky demands he lay a golden egg. Daffy tries to stall for time, at one point asking for surroundings that would make him more comfortable. Rocky and his henchmen oblige, but when Daffy tries to get out of providing the egg, they shoot him out of the nice pool he has been enjoying and take him back to their hideout.

Daffy is given five minutes to lay the egg, or else. The duck insists on privacy, then tries various ways to escape his predicament, but is stopped at every turn. When time runs out, Rocky fires his gun at Daffy&#x27;s head. The extreme stress results in him actually laying a golden egg.

Relieved he is now free to go, Daffy prances toward the door. Rocky holds him up, points into a room containing dozens of empty egg crates and orders the duck to fill them. Daffy groans, &quot;Oh, my achin&#x27; back&quot; and faints. 

=== Alternative ending ===
In the context of its inclusion in &quot;The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie&quot;, an alternate denouement is presented for this cartoon. Departing from the original conclusion where Daffy Duck succumbs to exhaustion, a new resolution unfolds as Bugs Bunny, assuming the guise of Elegant Mess (a satirical reference to Eliot Ness), arrives on the scene accompanied by law enforcement officers to apprehend Rocky and his cohorts.

Daffy, fatigued from executing Rocky&#x27;s commands, is depicted as being taken away on a stretcher to receive medical attention. Bugs, demonstrating concern for Daffy&#x27;s well-being, inquires if he requires any assistance, to which Daffy humorously requests immediate attention from a proctologist.

<text>According to the Table of Nations in the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible, Gether ( &quot;Geṯer&quot;) was the third son of Aram, son of Shem. He appears only twice in the Hebrew Bible, and both times is only mentioned in passing in genealogical lists. In the Table of Nations (Genesis 10:23), he is identified as a son of Aram, while in 1 Chronicles 1:17, he is listed among the sons of Shem.

In Islamic traditions, he (here called &#x27;Athir&#x27;) is sometimes considered the father of Thamud, whose descendant was the Islamic prophet Salih.

According to the first-century Jewish historian Josephus, Gether is an ancestor of the Bactrians. Jerome (c. 390) considers Gether the ancestor of the Acarnanians. Isidore of Seville (c. 635) makes him ancestor of the Acarnanians or Curians.

Australian Chinese revolutionary Tse Tsan-Tai makes him the ancestor of the Polynesians.

<text>Catty Cornered is a 1953 Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on October 31, 1953, and stars Tweety and Sylvester. It features a forerunner of the Rocky and Mugsy duo.

==Plot==
Tweety, who is a rare and valuable bird, has been captured and held for ransom by a duo of criminals: Rocky and his assistant Nick. Sylvester, who is interested only in finding food to eat, makes a number of attempts to steal Tweety:
*Sylvester climbs up the fire escape, then edges along a ledge to the apartment. Rocky sees him and places a banana peel on the ledge, causing Sylvester to slip and fall off.
*Sylvester climbs up the main stairs. Tweety escapes and meets Sylvester on the landing. Tweety refuses Sylvester&#x27;s offer to use his mouth as a hiding place (the cat tried to eat him; &quot;Not so hard!&quot;). Sylvester instead hides Tweety under a can just as the criminals arrive. Nick takes Sylvester inside for searching, while Rocky removes Tweety from under the can and replaces the bird with a firecracker. Sylvester escapes with the can, unaware of the firecracker, and is injured when it explodes.
*Sylvester hoists himself up using a pulley on a building site. He grabs Tweety and escapes, but the steel plate on the end of the pulley falls back down and lands on him.

Sylvester then gains access using a dumbwaiter. At the same time, police surround the building. Nick hides Tweety in the dumbwaiter, unaware that Sylvester is in there. Rocky is arrested (and likely Nick too). Sylvester escapes from the apartment block with Tweety and is quickly hailed as a hero by the press, who are unaware that he was only interested in eating the bird. Sylvester is forced to attend a celebration in which the mayor requests Sylvester to kiss Tweety, but he eats him, only to get forced to spit Tweety out by the mayor. Tweety ended the cartoon with &quot;Oooh, he&#x27;s a bad putty tat!&quot;

Note: One of the broadcast stations at the celebration was KFWB.

==Cast==
* Mel Blanc as Tweety, Sylvester, Rocky, Nick, Paperboy, News Reporter, Police Officer, Photographer and Mayor.
* Ralph James as Narrator.

==Clip reusage==
Part of this cartoon was edited into &quot;The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie&quot; (1981), with new animation showing Bugs Bunny giving Sylvester a badge.

<doc id="414384" wikidata="Q51535" url="?curid=414384" title="Vincente Minnelli">
<text>Vincente Minnelli (; born Lester Anthony Minnelli; February 28, 1903 – July 25, 1986) was an American stage director and film director. For a career spanning over half a century, he is best known for his sophisticated innovation and artistry in musical films. , six of his films have been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

Minnelli made his stage debut as an actor in a production of &quot;East Lynne&quot;, staged by the Minnelli Brothers&#x27; Tent Theater (co-founded by his father and paternal uncle). After graduating from high school, he worked as an apprentice window designer at Marshall Field&#x27;s department store in Chicago. There, he attended the Art Institute of Chicago and became a costume designer for the Balaban and Katz theater chain. By the early 1930s, he moved to New York City and served as the art director for the Radio City Music Hall.

In 1935, Minnelli became a theatre director with &quot;At Home Abroad&quot; (1935), starring Beatrice Lillie and Eleanor Powell. In 1937, Minnelli moved to Hollywood and served a brief stint at Paramount Pictures before returning to Broadway. In 1940, Minnelli was hired by Arthur Freed to work for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where he directed sequences in &quot;Babes on Broadway&quot; (1941) and &quot;Panama Hattie&quot; (1942). He made his directorial film debut with &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot; (1943). A year later, Minnelli directed &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; (1944) starring Judy Garland. He married Garland a year later, and their daughter Liza was born in 1946. He subsequently directed Garland in &quot;The Clock&quot; (1945), &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; (1945) and &quot;The Pirate&quot; (1948). He divorced Garland in 1951.

Throughout the 1950s, Minnelli directed numerous comedies, dramas and musicals, including &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; (1950), &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951), &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (1952), &quot;Lust for Life&quot; (1956) and &quot;Gigi&quot; (1958). &quot;An American in Paris&quot; and &quot;Gigi&quot; respectively both won the Academy Award for Best Picture, with Minnelli winning the Best Director for the latter film. For over 26 years, Minnelli became the longest-tenured film director for MGM.

By 1962, Minnelli&#x27;s relationship with MGM worsened due to the commercial failures of &quot;The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot; and &quot;Two Weeks in Another Town&quot;. He formed his production company called Venice Productions, partnering with MGM and 20th Century Fox on &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot; (1963) and &quot;Goodbye Charlie&quot; (1964). He directed his final film &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; (1976), starring his daughter Liza. Ten years later, in 1986, Minnelli died at his Beverly Hills residence, at age 83.

==Early life==
Lester Anthony Minnelli was born on February 28, 1903, to Marie Émilie Odile Lebeau and Vincent Charles Minnelli. He was baptized in Chicago, and was the youngest of four known sons, only two of whom survived to adulthood. His mother, whose stage name was Mina Gennell, was born in Chicago. She was of French-Canadian descent, and there is a likelihood of Anishinaabe lineage through her mother, who was born on Mackinac Island, Michigan. His father co-founded the Minnelli Brothers&#x27; Tent Theater, serving as the musical conductor. Both had met each other at a musical revue; although they initially argued over her accompaniment, they grew closer and were married in November 1894. Following the marriage, she joined the Minnelli Brothers troupe.

His paternal grandfather, Vincenzo Minnelli, and grand-uncle, Domenico Minnelli, both Sicilian revolutionaries, were forced to leave Sicily after the collapse of the provisional Sicilian government that arose from the 1848 revolution against Ferdinand II and Bourbon rule. Domenico Minnelli had been Vice-Chancellor of the Gran Corte Civile in Palermo at the time he helped organize the January 12, 1848, uprising there. After the Bourbon return to power Vincenzo reportedly hid in the catacombs of Palermo for 18 months before being successfully smuggled onto a New York-bound fruit steamer.

At three years old, Minnelli made his debut stage performance portraying Little Willie in &quot;East Lynne&quot;, alongside his mother performing dual roles as Lady Isabel and Madame Vine. During the performance, Minnelli broke character when his character was supposed to have died. His family moved to Delaware, Ohio, where he spent the first three years of high school at St. Mary&#x27;s. Since St. Mary&#x27;s had no twelfth grade, he spent his last year at Willis High School in Delaware, graduating at 16 years of age. There, he appeared in a school production of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; and starred in &quot;The Fortune Hunter&quot; at the Delaware Opera House.

==Career==
===1919–1936: Theatre career===
Following his high school graduation, Minnelli moved to Chicago, where he lived briefly with his maternal grandmother Le Beau and his aunt Amy. In search for a job, Minnelli took his portfolio of watercolor paintings to the Marshall Field&#x27;s department store. Arthur Valair Fraser, the store&#x27;s display director, reviewed his portfolio and hired him immediately as an apprentice window dresser. There, the store windows were changed four times a year with elaborate themes matched to each corresponding season. Minnelli was first assigned to design the men&#x27;s store, but he instead asked to design windows on Wabash Avenue where furniture and decorative antique items were frequently rearranged. Meanwhile, Minnelli enrolled in the Art Institute of Chicago with personal ambitions to become a painter. However, he dropped out due to his work schedule and lack of interest in the curriculum. 

While working at Marshall Field&#x27;s, a blind female customer arrived to rent stage props for the Radical Playhouse. She asked Minnelli to join their acting group where they were performing one-act plays by Eugene O&#x27;Neill. Minnelli agreed, and read for the part of a retired sea captain in O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Where the Cross is Made&quot;. He disliked this acting job, but Minnelli remained a frequent attendee of Chicago&#x27;s theatre district. In his spare time, he painted watercolor sketches of contemporary theatre actors, including Ina Claire and Mary Nash. Encouraged by his friends, he sold his paintings backstage, and earned enough money to live on his own. One night, while selling his artwork backstage, he was approached by Paul Stone, who admired Minnelli&#x27;s pictorial composition. &quot;If you can do this sort of thing, you can become a fine photographer,&quot; Stone told him. 

Minnelli left his Marshall Field&#x27;s job, and worked for Stone as an assistant photographer. Stone specialized in photographing actors and socialites from Chicago&#x27;s theater district at theatrical luminaries, society matrons and wedding parties. At Stone&#x27;s Raymor studio, Minnelli photographed numerous celebrities, including Ina Claire, where he coaxed them into capturing their best angles. Minnelli reflected, &quot;Stone&#x27;s photography was soft, but in sharp focus, so that it could reproduce on the printed page. This taught me a way of creating mood.&quot; Months later, Stone suffered a nervous breakdown, and Minnelli assumed his photography duties. Feeling photography was not his suited profession, Minnelli grew dissatisfied and began reading Elizabeth and Joseph Pennell&#x27;s 1911 biography of James McNeill Whistler, an American painter. Inspired by Whistler&#x27;s art techniques, Minnelli immersed himself in impressionist and surrealist painters, such as Henri Matisse, Marcel Duchamp, Max Ernst and Salvador Dalí. He also admired the experimental films of Jean Cocteau and Luis Buñuel, and the writings of Sigmund Freud. Around this time, Minnelli dropped Lester from his name, replacing it with &quot;Vincente&quot;; the final &quot;e&quot; was added in order to seem more sophisticated and elegant.

One day, Minnelli approached Frank Cambria, who headed the Chicago Theatre, which was a part of the Balaban and Katz theater chain. He told Cambria that he should open his own costume department, and allow him to run it. Cambria took Minnelli to A. J. Balaban&#x27;s office, where he was hired as a costume and set designer. Assigned to give the stage productions &quot;a custom touch&quot;, Minnelli was shocked the costume department operated on meager budgets. At the time, theatre productions ran one week at the Chicago Theatre where the sets and costumes were disassembled and reused at the Tivoli and Uptown Theatre.

In 1931, Balaban and Katz merged with the Paramount-Publix theater chain, and Minnelli was asked to work on New York stage productions for $150 a week. He left Chicago and rented a tiny Greenwich Village apartment. At Paramount, Minnelli worked exclusively in costumes, and was restricted from designing sets because he wasn&#x27;t in the set designers&#x27; union. He was eventually accepted into the union membership thanks to sponsorship from J. Woodman Thompson, a prominent stage designer. His first Broadway assignment was designing the show curtain for Earl Carroll&#x27;s 1931 edition of the &quot;Vanities&quot; musical revue. Taking inspiration from Léon Bakst&#x27;s designs for the Ballets Russes, Minnelli fashioned a –tall green and silver curtain to accompany the Art Deco theatrical style. Impressed, Carroll rehired Minnelli as a costume and set designer for the 1932 &quot;Vanities&quot;. 

By this time, Grace Moore asked Minnelli to supervise the art direction for the operetta, &quot;The Dubarry&quot;. During rehearsals, Minnelli and Moore had creative differences but remained cordial. The operetta had tryouts in Boston, and premiered in New York in November 1932 where it ran for 87 performances. Based on his success, Paramount executives selected him for costume and set design for the 1933 edition of &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;. However, by 1933, Paramount-Publix filed for bankruptcy protection, in which Adolph Zukor fired B. P. Schulberg as the studio&#x27;s head of production and began a corporate restructuring. Paramount&#x27;s East Coast studios were relocated to Astoria, New York, but it was decided their touring theatre unit was no longer profitable and was closed down in favor of touring big bands. 

Minnelli was eventually employed as a set designer at Radio City Music Hall, after it opened in December 1932. During rehearsals, theatre businessman Samuel &quot;Roxy&quot; Rothafel harshly criticized Minnelli, art director Clark Robinson, and dance director Russell Markert. Following another heated discussion, Robinson immediately resigned, to which Minnelli assumed Robinson&#x27;s former position. In July 1933, Minnelli&#x27;s first art direction assignment was designing a &quot;Water Lily&quot; ballet, a Cuban potpourri illustrated with a backdrop of fighting cocks, a Big Top interior for a circus number, and a Rue de la Paix dress shop to display the Roxettes. In December 1933, Minnelli art-directed a production of the &quot;Scheherazade&quot; suite by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. His efforts were applauded in the mainstream press, including &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. 

Despite this, Rothafel was later fired and was replaced by W. G. Van Schmus. In 1934, Schmus selected Minnelli to produce his first stage show titled &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;, which opened on October 25. Accompanied with music from E. Y. Harburg and Duke Ellington, the show displayed several sets, 
illustrating the French Riviera, the British Gold Coast, Ivory Coast and the Barbary Coast. Backstage, Minnelli was offered a directing job by Lee Shubert for his stage company. Despite the offer, Minnelli continued working for Radio City Music Hall until he left in April 1935. After months of considering, he joined Shubert&#x27;s organization, signing a contract to produce three musical shows over eighteen months.

Minnelli was handed his first directorial project titled &quot;At Home Abroad&quot;, with music composed by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz. Starring Beatrice Lillie, Ethel Waters, and Eleanor Powell, the Broadway musical centered on a married couple who flee the United States, and travel across Europe, Africa, Japan, and the West Indies. The musical had a try-out in Boston and opened at the Winter Garden Theatre on September 19, 1935. In his &quot;New York Times&quot; review, Brooks Atkinson praised Minnelli&#x27;s efforts, writing: &quot;Without resorting to opulence he has filled the stage with rich, glowing colors that give the whole work an extraordinary loveliness. Nothing quite so exhilarating as this has borne the Shubert seal before.&quot;

While &quot;At Home Aboard&quot; continued its Broadway run, Minnelli returned to costume and scenic design for the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies of 1936&quot;, starring Fannie Brice. John Murray Anderson was the director, but during rehearsals, he transferred directing duties to Minnelli. To update the look, Minnelli used the 1880s as inspiration for the hair styles and elegant costumes. Opening on January 30, 1936, the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; was a commercial success, running for five months and reopened for another five months after a summer hiatus. Minnelli was not involved in the revival, but instead chose to direct a musical revue titled &quot;The Show Must Go&quot;. Minnelli devised an original story, featuring new songs from a team of Tin Pan Alley lyricists. The show premiered on Christmas Day 1936 and ran for 237 performances during its initial run. A reprise opened in September 1937 and played for two weeks.

===1937: Brief stint at Paramount Pictures===
Based on his Broadway success, Hollywood had taken notice of Minnelli as a rising director. Samuel Goldwyn tentatively approached Minnelli to direct &quot;The Goldwyn Follies&quot; (1938), and in 1937, Paramount Pictures offered him a contract to produce and direct films. Although he was initially reluctant, Minnelli accepted the offer and was paid $2,500 a week. His first project was &quot;Times Squares&quot;, a mystery film set on Broadway. Leo Birinski was hired to write the script, with the plot detailing characters venturing throughout various musical numbers from Broadway shows to piece together vital clues. Minnelli also proposed a surrealist ballet featuring Paramount&#x27;s contract actors, and held conversations with Kurt Weill about a potential musical film. Minnelli discussed the project with Adolph Zukor, the head of Paramount, but he was uninterested; discussions with William LeBaron, the studio&#x27;s head of production, did not move the project forward.

Meanwhile, Minnelli proposed the title &quot;Shall We Dance&quot; (1937) to the Fred Astaire–Ginger Rogers film. He consulted on Raoul Walsh&#x27;s 1937 film &quot;Artists and Models&quot; devising the &quot;Public Melody No. 1&quot; number, featuring Louis Armstrong and Martha Raye.

===1937–1939: Return to Broadway===
After six months of negotiating, Minnelli was released from his contract and returned to Broadway. Lee Shubert offered him the musical &quot;Hooray for What!&quot;, which starred Ed Wynn and featured music and lyrics by Harold Arlen and E. Y. Harburg. Minnelli was given only three months for preparation before its premiere on December 1, 1937. The musical was well-received, with &quot;Life&quot; magazine calling it &quot;the funniest show of the year.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine also applauded: &quot;Sharing credit with Wynn for the show&#x27;s success is able Vincente Minnelli, trained in the hard school of movie stage-shows, who directed it and designed the scenery.&quot;

Inspired by the musicals &quot;Pins and Needles&quot; and &quot;Four Saints in Three Acts&quot;, Minnelli began developing a surrealist fantasy titled &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;, with Beatrice Lillie in mind to star. He offered her four musical numbers and four sketches outlining his vision, but Lillie, then in England, had not responded in time. He then shifted to a musicalization of S. N. Behrman&#x27;s play &quot;Serena Blandish&quot;, wanting to feature Black American actors. Cole Porter was hired to write the musical score. Sid Perelman wrote the libretto, while Lena Horne read for the title role. After six months of development, Minnelli abandoned the project. Exhausted, Minnelli took a sabbatical break until producer Max Gordon offered him to direct &quot;Very Warm for May&quot;. Oscar Hammerstein II and Jerome Kern were hired to write the lyrics and compose the musical score, respectively. Pleased with the musical&#x27;s first act, Minnelli unsuccessfully tried to rearrange the second act. The musical opened at the Alvin Theatre on November 17, 1939, with musical critic Brooks Atkinson writing in his review that Minnelli had not &quot;solved the confusion of the story.&quot;

Adjacent of this time, William Saroyan&#x27;s play &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot; had opened three weeks before and was well-regarded. Minnelli became friends with Saroyan and they partnered on a black surrealist musical comedy, with Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart composing the score. Both men collaborated with David Freeman on the script, but Saroyan exited the project. During the spring of 1940, Harburg brought Arthur Freed into Minnelli&#x27;s studio on East 54th Street. Minnelli remembered, &quot;Then Arthur Freed came to see me at my studio and convinced me to come to MGM to do the kind of thing that I liked, you know?&quot; After a discussion, Minnelli agreed to be paid $300 a week.

===1940–1949: Early MGM films===
On April 2, 1940, Minnelli began working for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. In 1941, he did minor consulting work, which included critiquing Norman Z. McLeod&#x27;s &quot;Lady Be Good&quot; (1941) and advising Pandro Berman to change the beginning of &quot;Rio Rita&quot; (1942). Sometime later, McLeod had filmed &quot;Panama Hattie&quot; (1942) but received lackluster responses during test screenings. In reaction, Freed hired Roy Del Ruth to film reshoots and Minnelli to direct the musical numbers featuring Lena Horne.

Meanwhile, Minnelli visited the set for &quot;Strike Up the Band&quot; (1940), starring Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland. Freed mentioned they needed a musical number for a scene where Rooney&#x27;s character aspires to be like Paul Whiteman, a bandleader. Minnelli suggested using a bowl of fruits, having spotted one on set. Freed liked the idea and hired Henry Fox to create a tabletop, while George Pal provided the stop motion animation of the musicians made of fruit. During filming, Minnelli met Garland, who had just turned 18 years old, for the first time. Minnelli subsequently worked on Busby Berkeley&#x27;s &quot;Babes on Broadway&quot; (1941), which also starred Rooney and Garland, for the &quot;Ghost Theater&quot; sequence. Minnelli suggested they imitate veteran Broadway stars, but Berkeley rejected the idea.

====&quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot;====
In 1942, Minnelli was called to Freed&#x27;s office where he was offered to direct &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot; (1943). Minnelli accepted, writing he &quot;interpreted the assignment, with more freedom than I&#x27;d dreamed possible, as just reward for past contributions.&quot; Based on the 1940 musical by Vernon Duke and John La Touche, &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot; tells the story of Petunia (Ethel Waters), a devout woman, who prays for the soul of her gambler-husband &quot;Little&quot; Joe Jackson (Eddie &quot;Rochester&quot; Anderson). 

Filming began in August 1942, with only Waters and Rex Ingram reprising their Broadway roles. Lena Horne was cast as Georgia Brown, a seductive woman who tempts Jackson. During production, Minnelli had shot a musical number &quot;Ain&#x27;t It the Truth,&quot; featuring Horne in a bubble bath. Joseph Breen of the Motion Picture Production Code objected to the scene, which was then excised from the film. Modestly budgeted at $679,260 (in 1942 dollars), &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot; earned $1.6 million at the box office.

====&quot;I Dood It&quot;====
Three weeks after he finished filming &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot;, Minnelli was assigned to direct &quot;I Dood It&quot; (1943), starring Red Skelton and Eleanor Powell. Del Ruth was the film&#x27;s original director but he had been drafted into the United States Army, leaving the film unfinished, and MGM dissatisfied with his cut. The film&#x27;s producer Jack Cummings hoped Minnelli would inject his style into the film. Onboard as director, Minnelli hired Sig Herzig and Fred Saidy to rewrite the script. A loose remake of &quot;Spite Marriage&quot; (1929), Skelton plays Joseph Renolds, a tailor&#x27;s assistant, who becomes enamored with Constance Shaw (Powell), a Broadway star, and attends every performance of her Civil War melodrama. Shaw impulsively marries Renolds to spite her lover (Richard Ainley). Herzig and Saidy updated the plot by having Skelton&#x27;s character reveal John Hodiak&#x27;s character to be a spy for the Axis powers.

Between projects, Minnelli directed Lena Horne in her &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot; segment in &quot;Thousands Cheer&quot; (1943).

====Films with Judy Garland====

For &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; (1944), Freed again hired Minnelli to direct. Framed around the four seasons, the film tells of the Smith family and their conflicts, with the conclusion focused on the family&#x27;s celebration of the 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair. Judy Garland was cast as Esther Smith, though she felt her role would be overshadowed by Margaret O&#x27;Brien, who was portraying Tootie. Principal photography began on December 7, 1943 though continued filming was frequently delayed by Garland&#x27;s tardiness and claims of illness. Determined to have Garland&#x27;s physical beauty showcased, he requested make-up artist Dorothy Ponedel be assigned to Garland. Ponedel refined her appearance, which included extending and reshaping her eyebrows, changing her hairline, modifying her lip line and removing her nose discs and dental caps. Filming wrapped on April 7, 1944. During filming, Garland and Minnelli had some creative differences, though Garland grew closer to him after watching the dailies. At the time, Garland was married to David Rose, but after they divorced, she began dating Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Premiering in November 1944, the film received universal critical acclaim and exceeded box office expectations, earning $7.56 million worldwide during its initial run.

Meanwhile, the 1945 musical &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; was in production with George Sidney as the film&#x27;s initial director. The film featured several musical numbers from the Ziegfeld Follies musical revues, starring many of MGM&#x27;s contracted talents. Midway through filming, Sidney asked to leave the production and Minnelli was hired to finish filming. Garland&#x27;s segment was shot in July 1944, with principal photography concluding in August. Minnelli directed a total of ten segments, with the remaining four directed by Sidney, Lemuel Ayers, Roy Del Ruth, and Robert Lewis.

&quot;The Clock&quot; (1945) was Garland&#x27;s first straight dramatic film after starring in several musical films. Fred Zinnemann was initially hired to direct the film. By August 1944, he was removed at Garland&#x27;s request after they could not get along and the dailes proved disappointing. When Freed asked who she wanted to replace him, Garland requested Minnelli to direct. Minnelli accepted the assignment on two conditions: Zinnemann would not object to his hiring and he would have creative control over Garland. Zinnemann&#x27;s footage was discarded aside from exterior shots of New York. The Pennsylvania Station was recreated on the MGM soundstage while local New York sites were filmed using rear projection. On January 9, 1945, before Garland was to film &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot; (1946), Minnelli and Garland were engaged to be married. The two married on June 15, inside Garland&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house in Wilshire, Los Angeles.
Minnelli&#x27;s next film was &quot;Yolanda and the Thief&quot; (1945) starring Fred Astaire and Lucille Bremer. Before he was hired for &quot;The Clock&quot;, &quot;Yolanda and the Thief&quot; was intended to be Minnelli&#x27;s next film. Adapted from the 1943 magazine short story by Ludwig Bemelmans and Jacques Théry, the film tells of two con men (Astaire and Frank Morgan) who are hiding from extradition in South America. Both men learn about Yolanda, a young heiress living a sheltered life in a convent and decide to con her. One night, Yolanda prays for a &quot;guardian angel&quot; which Astaire&#x27;s character impersonates. Freed had come across the magazine story and hired Bemelmans and Théry to write a treatment, and Robert Nathan to write the final screenplay. Filming began on January 15, 1945 and wrapped four months later. Upon its release, the film received mixed reviews with criticism towards its script and was a commercial disappointment.

By this point, Garland had become pregnant with her first daughter, Liza. A musicalized biopic of Jerome Kern titled &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot; (1946) was scheduled to begin production in October 1945. Garland had been cast as Marilyn Miller and Minnelli had been assigned to direct Garland&#x27;s scenes. Her scenes took two weeks to complete and were finished on November 8, 1945. However, one number &quot;D&#x27;Ya Love Me?&quot; was excised from the film.
Minnelli was next approached to direct &quot;Undercurrent&quot; (1946) by Pandro Berman with Katharine Hepburn and Robert Taylor cast in the lead roles. Based on a story by Thelma Strabel, the film is about the daughter of a small-town college professor who marries an industrialist and moves into the city with him. She soon learns about her missing brother-in-law, whom her husband is suspected of murdering, and investigates his disappearance. Robert Mitchum, who portrayed the missing brother, was loaned out to MGM by RKO Radio Pictures to co-star in the film. During filming, Hepburn was initially displeased with Minnelli as her director, though both became cordial as production continued. Meanwhile, Taylor grew irritated at their developing friendship and was feeling overshadowed by Mitchum.

The idea to adapt S. N. Behrman&#x27;s play &quot;The Pirate&quot; originated with Minnelli, with Garland suggesting it be adapted into a musical during their honeymoon. The story tells of Manuela, a local Caribbean woman, who daydreams of the pirate Macoco, better known as Mack the Black. She is unknowingly engaged to him, now identifying as Don Pedro, the portly and elderly village mayor. Serafin, a traveling actor, roleplays as the pirate to win Manuela&#x27;s affection. Freed initially resisted the idea but reluctantly agreed to produce it after reading a treatment. To replicate the success of &quot;For Me and My Gal&quot; (1942), Gene Kelly was cast to reunite his pairing with Garland.

On December 27, 1946, a recording session with Garland had to be cancelled due to her illness. Due to Garland&#x27;s frequent absences, filming did not begin until February 1947. Out of 135 days for rehearsals, filming and reshoots, Garland was absent for 99. After a preview in October, Minnelli agreed to shorten the film&#x27;s run time. Between October 21 and December 19, reshoots were taken with the musical number &quot;Voodoo&quot; replaced with a livelier reshoot of &quot;Mack the Black&quot;. When filming concluded, the film had gone over budget, costing $3.7 million. The film earned over $2.9 million at the box office, but posted a net loss of $2.2 million.

====&quot;Madame Bovary&quot;====
Despite the financial failure of &quot;The Pirate&quot;, Minnelli was slated to direct &quot;Easter Parade&quot; (1948) with Garland and Gene Kelly cast in the lead roles (though Kelly was later replaced by Fred Astaire after a rehearsal injury). Rehearsals began on September 5, 1947, but five days later, Minnelli was called into Freed&#x27;s office and removed from the film. Freed had cited Minnelli&#x27;s removal based on the advice of Garland&#x27;s psychiatrist. Charles Walters was hired to replace him. For almost a year, Minnelli was without a film project while Garland filmed &quot;Easter Parade&quot; and &quot;In the Good Old Summertime&quot; (1949). Pandro Berman phoned Minnelli at his office, offering him to direct a film adaptation of Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s novel &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;. Minnelli accepted as it was one of his favorite novels.

Lana Turner was initially offered the lead role but Minnelli rejected the idea as Turner was perceived as a sex symbol. The Production Code also warned that Turner&#x27;s onscreen image, along with the novel&#x27;s portrayal of marriage infidelity, would violate its guidelines. Jennifer Jones was considered but was under contract to her husband David O. Selznick, but MGM executive Benjamin Thau successfully negotiated a stipulation deal to borrow her. James Mason had wanted to play the role of Flaubert, while Louis Jourdan and Alf Kjellin (billed as Christopher Kent) were lent onto the film courtesy of Selznick. 

&quot;Madame Bovary&quot; was shot from mid-December 1948 to February 1949. During production, Minnelli notably filmed an elaborate waltz sequence, utilizing 360-degree pan camera movements accompanied to Miklós Rózsa&#x27;s pre-recorded instrumental score. Biographer Stephen Harvey called it &quot;one of the audacious epiphanies in any Minnelli movie.&quot; Released in August 1949, critics deemed &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; as an unusually distinguished film, adapting its source material with considerable drama and atmosphere. Sneak preview audiences responded favorably to the film and Jones&#x27;s performance, though it earned $2 million at the box office.

That same year, Minnelli reportedly directed the climax sequence in Robert Z. Leonard&#x27;s &quot;The Bribe&quot; (1949).

===1950–1958: Peak years===
====&quot;Father of the Bride&quot;====
Minnelli&#x27;s subsequent collaboration with Berman was &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; (1950) based on the bestselling 1949 novel by Edward Streeter. Jack Benny pursued the lead role and was given a screen test, but Minnelli wanted Spencer Tracy and cast him. Elizabeth Taylor and Joan Bennett were cast as the bride and her mother respectively. Filming began on January 16, 1950 and wrapped a month and a day later. Released in May 1950, the film earned $4.15 million in distributor rentals at the box office. 

Critical reception was positive, with Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling the film &quot;equally wonderful&quot; when compared to the book, with &quot;all the warmth and poignancy and understanding that makes the Streeter treatise much beloved.&quot; The film was nominated for three Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay.

====&quot;An American in Paris&quot;====
The basis for &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951) began from Freed&#x27;s friendship with Ira Gershwin at his residence. Freed told Ira he wanted to adapt his brother George&#x27;s orchestral piece &quot;An American in Paris&quot; into a film and potentially include a ballet sequence. In 1949, MGM and the estate of George Gershwin entered negotiations, by which the studio acquired the rights to Gershwin&#x27;s catalogue for $158,750 (). The story was inspired by a &quot;Life&quot; magazine article of American G.I.s studying art in Paris on sponsorship from the G.I. Bill, which Freed had remembered.

In the film, Jerry Mulligan (Kelly) is an artist studying in Paris. He meets Milo Roberts (Nina Foch), an heiress and arts patron who expresses a romantic and professional interest in Jerry. Meanwhile, Jerry romances Lise Bouvier (Leslie Caron), a young teen engaged to Henri Baurel (Georges Guétary), a friend of Jerry&#x27;s. Filming began on August 1, 1950 at the MGM studios, though production was halted on September 15 to prepare for the ballet sequence. Minnelli left to direct another film, &quot;Father&#x27;s Little Dividend&quot; (1951), the sequel to &quot;Father of the Bride&quot;. Filming began on October 9 and was finished 23 days later. After this, Minnelli returned to film the ballet sequence, starting on December 6 and wrapping on January 8, 1951. The film proved popular with audiences, earning over $8 million in the United States. Kelly and Caron were praised by film critics, though the film&#x27;s dramatic continuity was criticized. At the 1952 Academy Awards, &quot;An American in Paris&quot; was nominated for eight Oscars, winning six including Best Picture.

On January 18, 1951, Minnelli was announced to direct a musical film adaptation of Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;. Dean Stockwell was cast in the title role. William Warfield was cast as Jim, along with Gene Kelly and Danny Kaye as the Duke and Dauphin respectively. Rehearsals began in August; simultaneously, Minnelli was enlisted to film the fashion show finale for Mervyn LeRoy&#x27;s &quot;Lovely to Look At&quot; (1952). Adrian Greenburg (also known as &quot;Adrian&quot;) and Tony Duquette had designed costumes for the sequence, costing over $100,000 (). Minnelli declined to be credited for the film. On September 21, production on &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; was postponed indefinitely due to Kelly and Kaye&#x27;s withdrawal.

====&quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot;====
Due to similarities with &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951), Minnelli turned down the offer to direct &quot;Lili&quot; (1953). During a lunch meeting at the Romanoff&#x27;s, MGM producer John Houseman showed Minnelli a screenplay draft titled &quot;Memorial to a Bad Man&quot; based on a short story by George Bradshaw. It was later retitled &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (1952). Minnelli agreed to direct, with Kirk Douglas as his sole choice to portray ruthless film producer Jonathan Shields. However, MGM production head Dore Schary had offered the role to Clark Gable but he declined. Douglas read the script and accepted the role. Lana Turner was hired to portray Georgina Lorrison, the &quot;beautiful&quot;; when both casting choices were announced, the trades questioned: &quot;when these two get together...&quot;

The story focuses on Jonathan Shields (Douglas) and his Hollywood rise by manipulating three individuals: actress Georgina (Turner) whom he deceives by professing his love, director Fred Amiel (Barry Sullivan) whose picture he expropriates, and screenwriter James Bartlow (Dick Powell) who loses his wife to a scandalous affair. Upon its release, critics praised the film&#x27;s seedy depiction of Hollywood and the performances from the cast, most particularly Douglas, Turner and Gloria Grahame. The scene of Georgina&#x27;s emotional breakdown inside a moving vehicle was highlighted. At the 1953 Academy Awards, &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; was nominated for six Oscars, winning five including Grahame for Best Supporting Actress.

At the behest of Sidney Franklin, Minnelli was approached to direct two segments (&quot;Mademoiselle&quot; and &quot;Why Should I Cry&quot;) for the 1953 anthology film &quot;The Story of Three Loves&quot;. Minnelli agreed to direct the segment &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, adapted from the short story &quot;Lucy and the Stranger&quot; by Arnold Phillips. Reuniting with Leslie Caron, the segment featured Ricky Nelson, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Farley Granger, and Ethel Barrymore. Filming lasted for three weeks before wrapping in February 1952. The segment &quot;Why Should I Cry&quot; was dropped and reworked into &quot;Torch Song&quot; (1953), starring Joan Crawford.

====&quot;The Band Wagon&quot;====

Because of the success of &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951) and &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952), Freed decided to produce another film adapting the musical catalogue of renowned composers. For &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953), it was decided to adapt the music and lyrics by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz. To write a suitable storyline, Minnelli turned to the screenwriting team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green to devise the script. The film tells of Tony Hunter, an aging musical star who hopes a Broadway show will restart his career. He meets with two writer friends and a Broadway producer who stage a musical, starring Hunter and a ballerina. Fred Astaire was cast as Troy Hunter, while the writers Lester and Lilly Marton (portrayed by Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray) were loosely based by Comden and Green. Cyd Charisse was cast as the ballerina Gabrielle Gerard.

Filming began on October 20, 1952 and was finished on January 28, 1953. Premiering in July 1953, &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; received enthusiastic critical reception and earned $5.6 million at the box office. Archer Winsten, writing for the &quot;New York Post&quot;, called the film &quot;the best musical of the month, year, the decade, or, for all I know, of all time.&quot; The film received three Academy Award nominations for Best Story and Screenplay, Best Costume Design (Color), and Best Scoring of a Musical Picture.

Minnelli reteamed with Pandro Berman and the screenwriting team of Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich for &quot;The Long, Long Trailer&quot; (1954), which starred Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. Adapted from the 1951 novel by Clinton Twiss, a married couple, Nicky and Tacy Collins, purchases a new travel trailer home and spend a year traveling across the United States. Shot during the summer hiatus for &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, filming began on June 18, 1953 and wrapped the next month. On February 18, 1954, the film premiered at the Radio City Music Hall and earned $4.5 million in distributor rentals.

====&quot;Brigadoon&quot;====

In March 1951, MGM acquired the screen rights to Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe&#x27;s Broadway musical &quot;Brigadoon&quot;. Gene Kelly and Kathryn Grayson were set to star, though Kelly&#x27;s precommitments delayed production for two years. During the interim, Grayson departed and Moira Shearer was considered as a replacement, but Freed ultimately cast Cyd Charisse. &quot;Brigadoon&quot; was also Minnelli&#x27;s first film recorded in stereophonic sound and shot in the widescreen CinemaScope format, which Minnelli disliked due to concerns it would crop the actors&#x27; feet. In 1953, Minnelli, Kelly and Freed initially planned to film on location in Scotland while interior scenes would be shot at the MGM-British Studios in Borehamwood. During the spring, they scouted potential filming locations, though Minnelli stayed behind as he was occupied with &quot;The Long, Long Trailer&quot;. Kelly and Freed were convinced the Scottish climate was unreliable, and decided to film entirely on the MGM backlot in Culver City, California.

The story concerns two Americans Tommy Albright and Jeff Douglas (Kelly and Van Johnson) who get lost during a hunting trip in Scotland. They wander into the village of Brigadoon, which becomes visible once every century. During a joyful wedding, Tommy becomes smitten with a local woman Fiona Campbell (Charisse) despite his engagement to Jane Ashton (Elaine Stewart) back home. During filming, Minnelli admittedly felt &quot;frustrated by the picture&quot; as he was unsure on how to salvage Lerner&#x27;s script. Released in 1954, &quot;Brigadoon&quot; received a mixed reception from film critics. In his &quot;New York Times&quot; review, Bosley Crowther dismissed the film as &quot;curiously flat and out-of-joint, rambling all over creation and seldom generating warmth or charm.&quot;

During the fall of 1953, Minnelli began developing a film adaptation of William Henry Hudson&#x27;s novel &quot;Green Mansions&quot;. The next year, Lerner was recruited to write the screenplay. Intending to shoot on location in South America, Minnelli scouted locations in Peru, Panama, British Guiana, and Venezuela. There, he, art director E. Preston Ames, and a skeletal film crew shot 16 mm test footage of the jungles in Venezuela. Pier Angeli and Edmund Purdom were courted for the lead roles and given a screen test, but Freed was left unimpressed. The project was cancelled, though it later became a 1959 film starring Audrey Hepburn.

====&quot;The Cobweb&quot;====
Minnelli then directed &quot;The Cobweb&quot; (1955) after John Houseman handed him the 1954 novel by William Gibson. The story concerns the staff working at a psychiatry clinic, who are embroiled in a dispute over the latest draperies to be installed in the library. Minnelli read John Paxton&#x27;s script adaptation of the novel, but he felt it lacked &quot;the flavor of the book.&quot; He then approached Gibson to write additional dialogue to the script.

Richard Widmark, Lauren Bacall, Gloria Grahame, Lillian Gish, and newcomers John Kerr and Susan Strasberg were cast in the ensemble. The film was shot over seven weeks, starting in December 1954. Released in July 1955, the film received mixed reviews and failed at the box office, earning $1.5 million in distributor rentals.

====&quot;Lust for Life&quot;====

While &quot;The Cobweb&quot; was being edited, Minnelli discussed with MGM president Dore Schary a film version of the novel &quot;Lust for Life&quot; by Irving Stone as his next project. MGM had already obtained the film rights, though they requested an extension as its moratorium would lapse by December 1955. In the meantime, Schary and Arthur Freed wanted Minnelli to shoot a film adaptation of &quot;Kismet&quot;. Minnelli resisted as he disliked the original Broadway production. Schary offered Minnelli creative autonomy to film &quot;Lust for Life&quot; provided he would film &quot;Kismet&quot; first. &quot;Kismet&quot; (1955) tells of Haji, an opportunist street poet, whose powers are abused by the Wazir for personal gain. Meanwhile, Haji&#x27;s daughter Marsinah falls in love with the young Caliph. The film began shooting on May 23, 1955. Ten days before filming was complete, Minnelli left for France to begin filming &quot;Lust for Life&quot; (1956). Stanley Donen was brought in to finish the film, which was completed on July 22, 1955. &quot;Kismet&quot; premiered on October 8, 1955 at the Radio City Music Hall, earning $2.9 million at the box office (against a production budget of $2.6 million).

Simultaneously, Kirk Douglas&#x27; production company Byrna Productions announced they were producing &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, with Jean Negulesco as director. Soon after, Douglas was contacted by MGM, who noted they held the rights. A compromise was reached to have Minnelli direct and Douglas star as Vincent van Gogh. Filmed entirely on location in France, Belgium and the Netherlands, filming started in August 1955 and ended in December 1955. Throughout filming, Douglas notably remained in character. Minnelli called the film his personal favorite of the ones he directed. Released in September 1956, the film was mildly received by audiences, earning nearly $1.6 million in box office rentals. However, at the 1957 Academy Awards, &quot;Lust for Life&quot; received four Academy Award nominations for Best Actor (Kirk Douglas), Best Supporting Actor (Anthony Quinn), Best Screenplay and Best Art Direction/Set Decoration — Color. Quinn won for Best Supporting Actor.

====&quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot;====

Before Minnelli left to Europe to film &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, he agreed to direct Robert Anderson&#x27;s 1953 play &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot; into a feature film. The story tells of a young student named Tom who is accused of being a homosexual at a boys&#x27; prep school. The headmaster&#x27;s wife Laura takes a keen interest in him hoping to strengthen his masculinity. Due to the themes of homosexuality, Anderson, who was hired to rewrite his own play, had to sanitize the script due to regulations from the Production Code. Deborah Kerr, John Kerr (who previously starred in 1955&#x27;s &quot;The Cobweb&quot;), and Leif Erickson reprised their roles from the stage production. During its 1956 release, &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot; received positive reviews from film critics. It earned nearly $2.2 million in box office rentals.

====&quot;Designing Woman&quot;====

&quot;Designing Woman&quot; (1957) began as an original story by Helen Rose, MGM&#x27;s costume designer, loosely taken from &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; (1942). Intended as a star vehicle for Grace Kelly, James Stewart was cast opposite as the male lead and Joshua Logan was to direct. However, Kelly departed from the project when she retired from acting, two months after marrying Rainier III, Prince of Monaco. Stewart and Logan departed accordingly. In haste, Schary hired Minnelli to direct the film. As the new director, Minnelli selected Gregory Peck and Lauren Bacall as the new leads. Principal photography began on September 10, 1956 and was finished ten weeks later, with on-location filming at the Newport Beach, Beverly Hills Hotel, and Marineland. Released in May 1957, the film earned $3.7 million worldwide, but resulted in a loss of $136,000.

During pre-production for &quot;Gigi&quot; (1958), Minnelli replaced Ronald Neame during filming for &quot;The Seventh Sin&quot; (1957), a film adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s novel &quot;The Painted Veil&quot;. Neame had developed creative differences with MGM producer David Lewis. Sidney Franklin replaced Lewis as producer. Despite his contributions, Minnelli personally requested not to be credited.

====&quot;Gigi&quot;====

&quot;Gigi&quot; originated as a 1944 novella by Colette, which was adapted into a 1949 film starring Danièle Delorme. In 1951, playwright Anita Loos adapted the novella into a play, which went to Broadway and starred Audrey Hepburn in her first major role. Minnelli and Arthur Freed had discussed adapting &quot;Gigi&quot; years prior, but in 1953, Freed&#x27;s interest was renewed after seeing the Broadway play. Both approached Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, fresh off their success from &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, to compose songs for their adaptation. Lerner agreed on two conditions: to expand Honoré Lachaille&#x27;s role and have Maurice Chevalier cast in the film.

Hepburn was approached to reprise the role but declined. Minnelli instead cast Leslie Caron, having directed her in &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951). Louis Jourdan was cast as Gigi&#x27;s lover Gaston, while Chevalier, Hermione Gingold, Eva Gabor and Isabel Jeans filled the supporting roles. Desiring to film entirely on location, Minnelli shot the film in Paris starting in July 1957 during a massive heat wave. Because of the heavy period clothes, cast members grew overheated and even Minnelli contracted a case of whooping cough. Conflicts between Minnelli and Freed also arose. In September, having gone over budget, the crew decamped to California to film on the studio backlot; the Venice Beach was also used to represent Trouville. Filming was finished on October 30, 1957.

In early 1958, test previews for &quot;Gigi&quot; were poorly received, in which MGM president Joseph Vogel ordered nine days of reshoots. However, Minnelli was unavailable as he was filming &quot;The Reluctant Debutante&quot; (1958) overseas. Charles Walters was brought in to film the reshoots. The film premiered on May 15, 1958 at the Royale Theatre in New York, and went on to receive critical acclaim. At the 1959 Academy Awards, the film won all nine Oscar nominations including Best Picture. Minnelli was awarded his first Oscar for Best Director.

By the time of &quot;Gigi&quot; premiere, Minnelli had spent seven weeks filming &quot;The Reluctant Debutante&quot; (1958) from mid-February to early April. Adapted from the 1955 play by William Douglas Home, the story centers on Jane Broadbent, an American teenage girl, who arrives in London to attend debutante balls for her wealthy father Lord Jimmy Broadbent and stepmother Lady Sheila. During the fall of 1957, Pandro Berman showed Minnelli a first draft of the script, which displeased Minnelli who felt Americanizing the play was the wrong approach. The original London locale was reinstated back into the script. Regardless, he agreed to direct, and after Berman had recommended them, Minnelli approached Rex Harrison and Kay Kendall in New York with the central roles. Berman nevertheless cast American actress Sandra Dee so it would broaden American appeal. &quot;The Reluctant Debutante&quot; premiered at Radio City Music Hall in August 1958 to indifferent box office.

====&quot;Some Came Running&quot;====

In spring 1958, MGM purchased the film rights to James Jones&#x27;s 1957 novel &quot;Some Came Running&quot;. Sol Siegel, who had succeeded Schary as the new production head, hired Minnelli to direct the film adaptation. The novel tells of David Hirsh, an Army veteran and novelist, who returns home to the fictional town of Parkman, Indiana. He romances Gwen French, an emotionally repressed high school teacher, and befriends Ginny, a young, uneducated girl with loose morals. Frank Sinatra was cast as David Hirsh, alongside Shirley MacLaine, Martha Hyer, and fellow Rat Pack member Dean Martin as Bama Dillert. Because of its potential as an Oscar contender, Minnelli was given six months to complete the film for its winter 1958 release. During filming in Madison, Indiana, Sinatra and Martin grew tired of Minnelli&#x27;s meticulous shooting and walked off the film. Siegel however brought them back to finish the film.

Critical response was mostly positive, though a review in &quot;Time&quot; magazine gave the film a mixed critique. The review praised the first half but felt after that it shows &quot;occasional flickers of brilliant overacting by Shirley MacLaine, the chance to watch Frank Sinatra play Frank Sinatra, and the spectacle of Director Vincente Minnelli&#x27;s talents dissolving in the general mess of the story, like sunlight in a slag heap.&quot; Competing against &quot;Gigi&quot; (1958) at the Academy Awards, &quot;Some Came Running&quot; garnered Best Supporting acting nominations for MacLaine, Hyer, and Arthur Kennedy.

===1959–1963: Last years at MGM===
====&quot;Home from the Hill&quot;====
The dual success of &quot;Gigi&quot; and &quot;Some Came Running&quot; solidified Minnelli&#x27;s tenureship as director for MGM. On February 8, 1960, Minnelli received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the film industry. Overseas, his films had been acclaimed by French critics, some of whom published for the &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; film magazine. French critic Jacques Doniol-Valcroze wrote a lengthy critique for &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (1952), as did Jean Douchet for &quot;Lust for Life&quot; (1956). Douchet and Jean Domarchi had written assessment essays on Minnelli&#x27;s filmography and jointly interviewed him in 1962.

&quot;Home from the Hill&quot; (1960) was an adaptation of the 1958 novel of the same title by William Humphrey. It tells the story of a Texas family headed by patriarch Captain Wade Hunnicutt (Robert Mitchum), who is married to Hannah (Eleanor Parker), an embittered and sexually withdrawn wife, and the father to Theron (George Hamilton) and an illegitimate son Rafe (George Peppard). The film was shot on location in Oxford, Mississippi, followed by a month of filming on the MGM backlot, and then shot in Paris, Texas. A review in &quot;Variety&quot; called the film a &quot;powerful and absorbing story, and its production has the added interest of creating a vital and promising young star, George Peppard.&quot;

====&quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;====
In 1958, Arthur Freed purchased the film rights to the Broadway musical &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;, with its book and lyrics written by Betty Comden and Adolph Green and music by Jule Styne. Comden and Green were hired to adapt the musical into a screenplay with instructions that the script be no longer than 110 pages and delivered by December 31, 1958. Comden and Green met the deadline but delivered a 159-paged script, which Minnelli felt was too long. Filming was delayed twice until the script was ready. Judy Holliday reprised her Broadway role as Ella Peterson, a switchboard operator who listens in on the lives of private clients. She involves herself with playwright Jeffrey Moss (Dean Martin), and falls in love with him. Filming began on October 7, 1959 and lasted until December 24. Throughout filming, Holliday held creative differences with Minnelli as she disliked the script and his cinematic approach to the film.

A review in &quot;Variety&quot; felt the musical adaptation was &quot;ideally suited to the intimacy of the film medium&quot; and complemented Freed for remaining &quot;faithful to the buoyant spirit and whimsical personality of the original&quot;; Minnelli&#x27;s direction was praised as inserting &quot;spirit and snap into the musical sequences[,] warmth and humor into the straight passages and manages to knit it all together without any traces of awkwardness in transition&quot;. A review in &quot;Time&quot; magazine praised Holliday for her &quot;showmanly style&quot; while noting Minnelli &quot;manages to jog and jazz and jigger a merely middling book and some fairly forgettable tunes into one of the year&#x27;s liveliest and wittiest cinemusicals.&quot; By January 1961, &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot; had earned $2.825 million in anticipated box office rentals from the United States and Canada.

====&quot;Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot;====

While promoting &quot;Home from the Hill&quot; (1960), Minnelli was informed he was to direct a remake of the 1921 silent film &quot;The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot;. For the 1962 remake, the script was to occur during World War II although it retained the events cultiminating in World War I. Minnelli disagreed with this change; while John Gay was hired for rewrites, the revised script retained the updated setting. For the lead role, Minnelli had wanted French actor Alain Delon but Sol Siegel disagreed. Glenn Ford was cast instead after he had signed a new multi-picture contract with MGM. As typical with Minnelli&#x27;s films, the film was shot in Paris with interior scenes filmed in California. Shot from October 1960 to March 1961, it was scheduled for released by winter 1961; however, there were reshoots done during the summer. 

Postponed for release in February 1962, the film received criticism for its script and production values. It earned $2 million in distributor rentals, against its $7 million production budget. Overseas, the film was appreciated by European critics and said to have influenced Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;The Conformist&quot; (1970) and Vittorio De Sica&#x27;s &quot;The Garden of the Finzi-Continis&quot; (1970).

====&quot;Two Weeks in Another Town&quot;====
In 1960, MGM purchased the film rights to Irwin Shaw&#x27;s novel &quot;Two Weeks in Another Town&quot; for $55,000. John Houseman was appointed producer and approached Minnelli to direct. Minnelli recognized the novel&#x27;s similarities to &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (1952) and hired the film&#x27;s screenwriter Charles Schnee and composer David Raksin. The story tells of Jack Andrus, a washed-up actor, who arrives in Rome to help his old mentor Maurice Kruger and supervise the dubbing of his latest film. Minnelli offered the lead role to Kirk Douglas, while Edward G. Robinson and Cyd Charisse portrayed Kruger and Carlotta, Jack&#x27;s ex-wife, respectively. Filming began in October 1961 in Rome with a scheduled nineteen-day on-location shoot. However, Minnelli did not finish until a month later. Filming resumed on the MGM backlot for eleven weeks, starting on November 9.

Minnelli had also shot an orgy sequence, which infuriated Siegel. In spring 1962, the film received poor test responses during sneak previews. Siegel was replaced by Robert Weitman as production head, while Joseph Vogel appointed studio editor Margaret Booth to drastically re-edit the film. The orgy sequence was condensed while Charisse&#x27;s ending monologue was also removed. Minnelli and Houseman were not consulted during most of the film&#x27;s post-production. The film was released without fanfare and was another box office failure.

By 1962, MGM was in financial turmoil due to severe commercial flops, including &quot;Cimarron&quot; (1960), &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1962), and Minnelli&#x27;s own &quot;Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot; (1962). This, along with the re-editing of &quot;Two Weeks in Another Town&quot; (1962), fractured Minnelli&#x27;s relationship with MGM. His contract with the studio was up for renewal, in which Minnelli formed his own production company Venice Productions to leverage greater bargaining power. He negotiated to earn 25 percent of any net box office profits, in addition to his salary as director, as well as retain final cut privilege through the second previews. In April 1962, MGM and Venice Productions agreed to a co-production deal to produce six films over four years.

====&quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot;====

Under his new contract, Minnelli directed &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot; (1963), having read the 1961 novel about a young son wanting his widowed father to remarry to be &quot;warm and winning.&quot; The film&#x27;s producer, Joe Pasternak, cast Glenn Ford and Ron Howard as the father and son respectively. Released in 1963, film critics found the film sentimental and mildly engaging. It earned $2 million in distributor rentals. 

Minnelli&#x27;s next project was meant to be &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1964), but Warner Bros. had outbid MGM for the film rights at $5.5 million. Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe pleaded with Jack Warner to hire Minnelli as director, but negotiations broke down due to salary disagreements; Warner instead hired George Cukor.

===1964–1976: Later years===
====&quot;Goodbye Charlie&quot;====

For most of 1963, Minnelli was without a film project. MGM allowed Minnelli to accept outside directing jobs, in which he selected Twentieth Century Fox&#x27;s offer to direct &quot;Goodbye Charlie&quot; (1964) starring Tony Curtis and Debbie Reynolds. This was his first film produced outside of MGM. Adapted from George Axelrod&#x27;s 1959 play, the story involves Charlie Sorrel, a womanizer who is shot by a jealous husband and returns to Earth reincarnated as a beautiful blonde. As a woman, Charlie meets with his friend George Tracy (Curtis) to consult about her new identity. Pre-production and filming lasted from January to July 1964 on Fox&#x27;s studio backlot with location shoots in Malibu, California. 

Released in November 1964, it received mixed reviews from film critics, with Bosley Crowther negatively stating &quot;Debbie Reynolds and Tony Curtis [are] so sadly cast in distasteful roles that it causes even a hardened moviegoer to turn away from it in pain and shame.&quot; By January 1966, the film had earned $3.7 million in distributor rentals from the United States and Canada. 

====&quot;The Sandpiper&quot;====
Minnelli returned to MGM to direct &quot;The Sandpiper&quot; (1965) starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Intended as a vehicle for the star couple, Martin Ransohoff devised an original story of a love affair between a married Episcopalian minister and a free-spirited single mother. The couple first turned to William Wyler, but he declined the offer. Taylor and Burton then asked Minnelli, who had previously directed Taylor in &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; (1950) and &quot;Father&#x27;s Little Dividend&quot; (1951). Needing a box office success, Minnelli accepted the offer. The film was shot on location in Big Sur, California before filming in Paris. 

The film was released in 1965 and was a box office success earning $6.4 million in distributor rentals. This was the last film produced under the MGM–Venice Productions deal. While the films were moderately successful, they failed to generate enough profit.

====&quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot;====

Minnelli then developed a musical film titled &quot;Say It With Music&quot;, a biographical film of Irving Berlin he had been contemplating for several years. Frank Sinatra and Julie Andrews were considered for the lead roles, but MGM president James Aubrey shut down development by 1969 due to the declining commercial success of musical films. The Freed Unit was closed, and MGM and Minnelli agreed to part ways.

In 1964, producer Arthur P. Jacobs asked Minnelli to direct a musical adaptation of the novel &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; with Rex Harrison in mind for the title role. Minnelli however declined the offer. According to film historian Mark Harris, he agreed to direct &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; (1967), which would have reunited him with Harrison and Alan Jay Lerner. The film was tentatively scheduled for a Christmas 1966 release, but Minnelli left the project and was replaced by Richard Fleischer. 

Lerner&#x27;s then-latest Broadway musical &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot; was optioned for a film adaptation by Paramount Pictures, with Barbra Streisand considered for the lead role. After failing to get Minnelli hired for &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1964), Lerner successfully campaigned to have Minnelli direct the adaptation. Filming began on January 6, 1969 for an intended 82-day shoot. The film was originally scheduled for a fall 1970 roadshow release, but after 1969&#x27;s &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; (which also starred Streisand) had disappointed at the box office, the film&#x27;s release was pushed up to the summer. Fifteen minutes were removed from the film&#x27;s run time. 

Released in June 1970, the film received decent reviews from film critics. Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote the film &quot;is just about as good as it could be. It is bright, it is romantic, it is solidly produced, it centers on an expertly comedic performance by Barbra Streisand and a charming if remarkably unpersuasive turn by Yves Montand as a psychiatrist, it is inventive, it is innocent.&quot; By January 1971, the film had earned $4.75 million in box office rentals in the United States and Canada.

====&quot;A Matter of Time&quot;====

Minnelli then turned to a film project, which would star his daughter Liza Minnelli, who had been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for &quot;The Sterile Cuckoo&quot; (1969). They brainstormed a biographical film of Zelda Fitzgerald, but it failed to proceed after discussions with Paramount Pictures president Frank Yablans. He concurrently began developing a biographical film of Bessie Smith with Tina Turner in mind, but it fell through.
In 1974, Minnelli became interested in adapting Maurice Druon&#x27;s 1954 novel &quot;The Film of Memory&quot; (&quot;La Volupté d&#x27;être&quot;). Retitled &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; (1976), it tells of a financially distressed contessa who tutors a young chambermaid. He turned to veteran collaborators, including screenwriter John Gay and producer Edmund Grainger. After several major studios declined, American International Pictures (AIP) agreed to finance the film with a $5 million production budget. Ingrid Bergman, who had won her third Academy Award for &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974), was cast as the Contessa.

Filming began in August 1975 in Rome and Venice for a 14-week shoot. However, filming lasted 20 weeks due to harsh winter conditions, labor strikes, and mandated shorter production hours. Minnelli&#x27;s first assembly cut was over three hours. AIP president Samuel Z. Arkoff subsequently wrestled control of the film away from Minnelli, deleting several flashbacks and restructuring the film entirely. Alarmed by the news, Martin Scorsese had a petition signed by several prominent Hollywood directors, protesting Arkoff&#x27;s treatment of Minnelli. Flattered by the support, Minnelli nevertheless disowned the film. The film premiered at the Radio City Music Hall on October 7, 1976 but was a financial disappointment.

==Personal life==
===Marriages===
Minnelli first met Judy Garland during the filming for &quot;Strike Up the Band&quot; (1940). They married on June 15, 1945 in Garland&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house in Wilshire, Los Angeles. They had one child, Liza May Minnelli (born 1946). The marriage fractured during the filming for &quot;The Pirate&quot; (1948). In 1949, Minnelli and Garland temporarily separated. On June 16, 1950, MGM suspended Garland; three days later, Garland attempted suicide by slashing her throat with a piece of glass. On December 7, they announced their legal separation and intent to divorce. The divorce was finalized on March 29, 1951 with Garland retaining parental custody of Liza.

On February 16, 1954, Minnelli married Georgette Magnani, the sister of Miss Universe 1953 Christiane Martel. After winning for Miss Universe, Christiane was offered an acting contract with Universal Pictures and Georgette was assigned by their parents to chaperone her. At a Hollywood party, Vernon Duke introduced Minnelli to Georgette. Smitten by her appearance, Minnelli offered Georgette a screen test, which she turned down. The couple had one child, Christiane Nina Minnelli (born 1955). During post-production on &quot;Gigi&quot; (1958), Magnani filed for divorce.

During his 1960 vacation in Italy, Minnelli met Danica (&quot;Denise&quot;) Radosavljević Gay Giulianelli de Gigante, a Yugoslavian-born divorceé. She accompanied him during the filming of &quot;Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot; (1962), and they were married in January 1962. Minnelli and Gigante co-founded their production company Venice Productions, partnering with MGM on a new contract to produce six films over four years. By 1970, Minnelli had heard rumors Denise was having adulterous affairs with other men, which she denied. They divorced in August 1971.

Minnelli met his fourth wife, Margaretta Lee Anderson, through his third wife who befriended her during the 1960s. After her divorce, Gigante encouraged Anderson to move in with Minnelli. After three failed marriages, Minnelli vowed never to marry again though they continued to be domestic partners. Minnelli was married to her from 1980 until his death in 1986.

===Sexual orientation===
For years, there was speculation in the entertainment community that Minnelli was gay or bisexual. Minnelli biographer Emanuel Levy claimed existing evidence that Minnelli did, in fact, live as an openly gay man in New York prior to his arrival in Hollywood, where the town that made him a film legend also pressured him back into the closet. According to Levy: &quot;He was openly gay in New York – we were able to document names of companions and stories from Dorothy Parker. But when he came to Hollywood, I think he made the decision to repress that part of himself or to become bisexual.&quot; Lester Gaba, a retail display designer who knew Minnelli in New York, was reported to have frequently claimed having an affair with Minnelli, although the same person who related Gaba&#x27;s claim also admitted that Gaba &quot;was known to embellish quite a bit.&quot;

===Death===
He had a pacemaker fitted at Christmas 1982.

On July 25, 1986, Minnelli died in his Beverly Hills home, aged 83, from emphysema and pneumonia, which had caused him to be repeatedly hospitalized in his final year. He is interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

Minnelli left an estate valued at slightly over US$1.1 million, the bulk of which was left to his daughter, Liza. He bequeathed US$100,000 to his widow. While his home in Beverly Hills was left to his daughter Liza, Minnelli requested in his will that his widow continue to live there.

==Legacy==
===Perception as an auteur===
Despite his varied filmography of musicals, comedies and melodramas, Minnelli has been criticized as being a decorative artist than an auteur filmmaker, elevating artistic imagery while distracting audiences from the narrative and dialogue with elaborate camera angles. In his 1968 book &quot;The American Cinema&quot;, Andrew Sarris called Minnelli a &quot;pure stylist&quot; who &quot;believes more in beauty than in art.&quot; Sarris further wrote: &quot;Minnelli has always required relatively luxurious projects upon which to lavish his taste. If he has a fatal flaw as an artist, it is his naϊve belief that style can invariably transcend substance and that our way of looking at the world is important than the world itself.&quot; In 1975, Richard Schickel wrote Minnelli is &quot;not by nature a storyteller. He does not have a very good eye—or memory—for revealing anecdotes. Nor does he have an analytical turn of mind. He seems mainly to feel his way toward the solution of creative problems, clued more by visual ideas (and of course, musical ones) than by any of the signs one might term &#x27;literary. 
Emmanuel Levy sharply disagreed, writing Minnelli was &quot;an auteur in thematic, stylistic, and ideological terms. His films demonstrate vividly that concepts of art and artificiality run throughout his work.&quot; In 1959, Albert Johnson, in an article for &quot;Film Quarterly&quot;, called Minnelli &quot;a master of the decorative image&quot;, to which he belongs &quot;neither to the old school nor to the new, but remains in a special position of accomplishment, one which permits all spheres of the visual and decorative arts to embellish his films.&quot; In a foreword for Minnelli&#x27;s memoir &quot;I Remember It Well&quot;, Alan Jay Lerner (of Lerner and Loewe) called Minnelli &quot;the greatest director of motion picture musicals the screen has ever seen.&quot; Film historian Jeanine Basinger called Minnelli &quot;a visual artist. His films have wit and charm and beauty, but they also have cinematic style. His ability just to &quot;decorate&quot;, make everything in the frame look right, look beautiful, look appropriate and complementary to other things inside it, was unparalleled. He was one of the few directors who could develop his own personal vision in musicals, a difficult genre for a director because there is no more collaborative genre, none more dependent on the talents of so many others to succeed.&quot; 

Stanley Donen, a contemporary of Minnelli&#x27;s and fellow director of musical films, once criticized Minnelli&#x27;s musicals for their &quot;sloppy&quot; stories, and adopted a more bold, no-nonsense, and realistic style compared to Minnelli&#x27;s impressionist visual style. Stephen M. Silverman also distinguished both filmmakers&#x27; camerawork, observing Minnelli tends to track forward or backwards while Donen frequently uses horizontal tracking and crane shots to support the story and choreography. On the contrary, Minnelli did not mind interrupting the stories for a grand and visual performance. Michael Kidd, a choreographer for MGM&#x27;s most noted musicals, stated he preferred collaborating with Donen than Minnelli. He stated, &quot;Vincente was a difficult person to communicate with. He was not very articulate, he would leave sentences unfinished. He had a great love of the visual aspects of moviemaking—he was originally a set designer, and people used to complain all the time, &#x27;He shoots the scenery&#x27;—but Vincente was not one to engage in collaborative work.&quot; 

In 2012, film historian Ronald Bergan contrastingly wrote: &quot;What distinguished Minnelli from most of the other directors on the MGM roster was his &quot;mise-en-scène&quot; – his elegant compositions within an individual frame – the relation of objects and people, the interplay of light and dark, the pattern of colour.&quot; Joseph Andrew Casper noted Minnelli&#x27;s &quot;metteur en scène&quot; as &quot;essentially expressionistic&quot; by which he uses decor to create &quot;a spatial-temporal continuum, albeit researched and dramatically related, filtered through the director&#x27;s spirit. As such, one gets the distillation or the essence of a place and period imbibing attitudes and feelings ... Minnelli holds no mirror up to nature but places a lamp next to it. His is the recreative rather than the mimetic tradition of art.&quot; Basinger agreed: &quot;His filmed universe was one of fantasy and reality mixed, of dreams and deceptions, and of a decor that is always carefully researched, designed, and executed with the purpose not only of being rewarding in and of itself, but also of defining character and setting.&quot; 

===Approach with actors===
Throughout his career, Minnelli directed seven different actors in Oscar-nominated performances: Spencer Tracy, Gloria Grahame, Kirk Douglas, Anthony Quinn, Arthur Kennedy, Shirley MacLaine, and Martha Hyer. Grahame and Quinn were the two to win. Despite this, Minnelli is often perceived as not emphasizing enough of the actors&#x27; performances in his films. During filming for &quot;Some Came Running&quot; (1959), Minnelli spent hours setting up a single shot because he wanted a Ferris wheel in the background, or a vase to hold the right kind of flowers. Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin both grew frustrated with multiple takes for a brief scene, and stormed off the set. 

George Peppard, an alumnus of the Actors Studio, clashed with Minnelli during filming for &quot;Home from the Hill&quot; (1960). During one take of the last scene, Minnelli told Peppard: &quot;George, you might be a seething volcano inside. But I&#x27;ve got news for you. Nothing&#x27;s happening. You&#x27;ll have to do it my way.&quot; Shirley Jones, who co-starred in 1963&#x27;s &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot;, recalled Minnelli never gave her specific directions for her character during filming. She stated, &quot;Vincente liked to draw pretty pictures with the camera, and it was always for me to move to a certain point, put my hand here when I say this line but never any direction about character, and I missed that.&quot;

<doc id="414388" wikidata="Q4189392" url="?curid=414388" title="UTA Flight 141">
<text>UTA Flight 141 was a scheduled international passenger flight operated by Guinean regional airline Union des Transports Africains de Guinée, flying from Conakry to Dubai with stopovers in Benin, Libya and Lebanon. On 25 December 2003, the Boeing 727–223 operating the flight struck a building and crashed into the Bight of Benin while rolling for take off from Cotonou, killing 141 people. The crash of Flight 141 is the deadliest crash in Benin&#x27;s aviation history.

The investigation concluded that the crash was primarily caused by overloading. However, it also subsequently revealed massive incompetence within the airline, particularly on its dangerous safety culture. The issue had gone unnoticed following lapses between authorities and further incompetence in management oversight led to the aircraft&#x27;s overloaded state. Multiple factors, including the short runway at Cotonou and the high demand of passengers for the route, had also contributed to the crash.

In regards to the result of the investigation, the Guinean government was urged to create reforms and regulations on the civil aviation authorities in the country. The BEA, the commission responsible for the investigation, had also urged ICAO to examine provisions related to safety oversight and the FAA and the European EASA were asked to support the creation of an autonomous weight and balance calculation system on board every airliner.

== Background ==
In the 20th century, most countries in West Africa did not have the capability to create and maintain a national airline. For decades, flight routes in West Africa were mainly served by Air Afrique, a transnational airline for Francophone West and Central Africa. It was once considered one of the largest airlines in Africa and one of the most reputable. However, after reports of mismanagement, corruption and the fallout of the aviation industry following the September 11 attacks, Air Afrique declared bankruptcy in 2002.

In the aftermath of Air Afrique&#x27;s demise, there were no more routes connecting major cities in West Africa and to other regions. The bankruptcy of Air Afrique caused isolation between the countries, despite their close geographical location. While Air Afrique&#x27;s routes were immediately taken over by Air France, most of the flights were perceived as inconvenient. Such an example was a flight from Conakry to Cotonou, in which passengers had to fly to Paris first before they could continue to Cotonou. Immediately, there were high demands for new airlines to open more direct routes.

In an attempt to fill the void left by Air Afrique, multiple existing small airlines began to offer services to these major routes. Among them was Union des Transports Africains de Guinée (also known as UTA), a regional airliner that was operated by Lebanese people in Guinea.

For years, the Lebanese diaspora was part of the backbone of the economic activity in multiple West African countries. Many Lebanese businessmen had forged robust relationships with government officials to sign contracts within West Africa&#x27;s public infrastructure sectors. An example was cited on a CIA document from 1988, with the following quote explaining the economic situation in one of the West African countries:

However, the lack of direct flights to Lebanon caused dozens of Lebanese to board transit flights between multiple cities in West Africa. Lebanon&#x27;s flag carrier, Middle East Airlines, previously had operated flight routes in West Africa and later decided to terminate the service.

On 23 July 2003, the government of Benin granted temporary authorization for UTA to operate charter flights for Conakry – Cotonou – Beirut – Cotonou – Conakry route. The airline later requested clearance to operate another extension flight to Dubai, known for its duty-free shopping, possibly to amplify profitability. The request was granted in November 2003.

== Aircraft ==
The aircraft was a Boeing 727-223. Manufactured in 1977 with a serial number of 21370, it was equipped with three Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-9A engines. The aircraft was registered as N865AA and was delivered to American Airlines.

Throughout its operational history, the aircraft had been operated by multiple operators. From June 1977 to January 2003, the aircraft was owned by American Airlines. However, in October 2001 the aircraft was stored in California&#x27;s Mojave Desert. It subsequently became the property of Wells Fargo Bank Northwest in October 2002.

In January 2003, the aircraft was sold to a Miami-based leasing company Financial Advisory Group (FAG). The aircraft was then delivered to Ariana Afghan Airlines following FAA authorization to operate a ferry flight to Kabul under a new registration of YA-FAK. The first leasing contract was signed by Swaziland&#x27;s Alpha and Omega Airways and the aircraft subsequently changed its registration to 3D-FAK in June 2003. In October 2003, the aircraft was subleased by Alpha and Omega Airways to UTA and the aircraft was registered under Guinean registration of 3X-GDO.

The aircraft had undergone a total of 40,452 flight cycles. The last major C check, the highest category for an aircraft maintenance, was carried out in January 2001 by American Airlines. There were insufficient documents on modifications that had been made on the aircraft. It was described as &quot;materially impossible&quot; to obtain the appropriate documents of the aircraft during its operation with UTA.

==Flight==
Flight 141 was a chartered passenger flight from the Guinean capital of Conakry, Benin&#x27;s largest city of Cotonou and the Lebanese capital of Beirut with the final destination in Dubai. A stopover was included in the flight plan with the Libyan town of Kufra as a refueling stop. It was a weekly scheduled flight with one round trip flight per week.

The aircraft had been chartered by 2 Lebanese men. Many of those on board were Lebanese diaspora who had been living in multiple West African countries for years. As it was Christmas Day, many of those on board were travelling home to spend the holidays with families. Dozens of passengers could be seen carrying hand baggage filled with Christmas gifts. The situation was chaotic as the check-in staff at the airport had not allocated seats for the passengers. A boarding pass was also not needed at the airport. Passengers could sell their respective seats at last-minute to someone else who were not booked on the flight as their names were not written on the boarding pass.

The aircraft was full with passengers. A total of 86 people had boarded the aircraft in Conakry and 9 people had disembarked in Cotonou. The aircraft had also received another 10 passengers from an aircraft that had flown from Togo. The boarding was disorderly. Many passengers tried to sit beside their friends and even occupied the cabin jump seats and the cabin crew were overwhelmed. Meanwhile, the flight crew were involved in an argument inside the cockpit as they had not received the basic information on the aircraft&#x27;s load.

While the cockpit crew were engaged in an argument on the weight and balance, the ground baggage handler was loading the baggage at the aft of the aircraft. One of UTA&#x27;s agents then asked the handler to load the baggage at the forward hold, which was already filled with baggage. Subsequently, the forward hold was full with baggage. Back in the cockpit, the crew continued to discuss the weight of the baggage. They became more frustrated as there were no information regarding the number of passengers that had boarded the aircraft in Cotonou. It was a tense situation as all the flight crew were unable to determine the exact weight of the baggage of each passengers.

As the Captain decided to discuss the matter with the flight engineer, the First Officer became angry and yelled at the Directorate General of UTA, who was sitting at the cockpit jump seat across him, due to the absence of information. The UTA executive, however, tried to reason with the First Officer on the matter.

The UTA executive immediately apologized to the crew. He stated that he would tell the management off as soon as the aircraft arrived in Beirut, later added that he would send messages to not allow anymore baggage or luggage weighing more than 30 kilograms. By this time, all passengers had already boarded the aircraft. Fuel was added to both tanks and the flight plan had been filed by the captain. The Captain then configured the aircraft with flaps at 25 degrees. The elevator was set at 6 and full power with brakes on would be applied for the take-off, followed by a three-degree maximum for take-off climb. The First Officer was the pilot flying.
The air conditioner was shut down. The weather was hot and dry. Weather report stated that there were cirrus clouds covering the sky and that there were some stratocumulus at an altitude of . The visibility was about and the humidity was at 75%.

As everything was set, the crew began the take-off roll. However, several passengers were still reluctant to sit down and decided to stand near their friends. This led the chief flight attendant to inform the cockpit crew on the situation. Order was finally restored after the Directorate General of UTA had called for order and the passengers finally decided to sit down on the floor.

At 13:58 local time, the flight crew applied take-off thrust. A few seconds later, the brakes were released. The First Officer was pushing the nose down and the captain was observing the airspeed. The aircraft then reached V1 and subsequently reached its VR speed. An input from 5-degree nose down to 10-degree nose up was made by the First Officer in a span of two seconds. The nose of the aircraft, however, remained constant and the speed continued to increase.

The Captain became anxious as the aircraft&#x27;s wheel had not lifted off the runway. He then called for rotation at least twice. The First Officer then pulled the yoke even harder so the aircraft could take-off. The angle of attack then changed from −1.2-degree to a maximum of +9-degree, at a speed of 1 degree per second.

The aircraft finally managed to lift off at 13:59:07 for a negligible altitude. Realizing that they were going to run out of runway, the captain urged the first officer to pull harder.

At 13:59:11, the aircraft struck the localizer antennas at the end of the runway. The aircraft&#x27;s main landing gears then impacted the localizer building, causing the roof to fly for approximately 9 meters from the point of impact. The right main landing gear then detached. The impact subsequently caused small parts of the tail and the aircraft&#x27;s stair to detach as well. The aircraft then impacted the airport&#x27;s concrete boundary fence, scraping the lower part of the fuselage and caused some parts of the flaps to separate from the wings.

The aircraft then slid and struck a rainwater drainage canal located right after the perimeter fence. The collision damaged the aircraft&#x27;s landing gears and parts of its wings. The leading edge and the outer aileron from the right wing then separated from the airframe. A survivor who was seated at the rear of the aircraft stated that people flew off their seats and, at the moment of impact, &quot;fly around the cabin&quot;. According to testimonies, some passengers had not attached their seatbelts.

After it had struck the drainage canal, the aircraft broke up into three parts; the cockpit section, the fuselage, and the tail of the aircraft, all of which ended up in the sea. Majority of the fuselage managed to stay intact. However, the fuselage became upside down due to the impact, drowning the occupants inside. Those who were seated near the breaks were able to get out of the sinking wreckage.

=== Search and rescue ===
The crash was loud enough to be noticed by the two controllers in the tower. The fire brigade immediately arrived at the destroyed localizer building and later confirmed that a technician inside the building was seriously injured by the collision. Members of the fire brigade then went down to the beach and found that the situation was already chaotic. Nearby beachgoers and residents had immediately flocked to the site. While some passengers managed to escape from the sinking wreckage, several others were still trapped inside the fuselage. According to CNN, several onlookers screamed as dead bodies washed on the beach. Several relatives of those on board even tried to recover the bodies of their next of kin by jumping into the sea.

The first hour of the rescue operation was difficult as the situation was hampered by thousands of onlookers on the crash site. Emergency crew could not execute their duties effectively. Some emergency vehicles even became stuck in the sand. Lack of coordination between rescue organizations further aggravated the situation. The police had to use belts to push back onlookers.

Benin&#x27;s Health Minister Celine Segnon stated that at least 90 people had died due to the crash, while 18 people had survived. Among them were the cockpit occupants. All except one of the people who were in the cockpit had managed to survive the crash. The First Officer was killed after his head had struck the right side of the cockpit during the impact. The search and rescue operation continued through the night as rescuers tried to recover more bodies and survivors. The nation&#x27;s navy divers, army and Red Cross had been dispatched to assist in the rescue operation. Beninese President Mathieu Kérékou personally visited the crash site to observe the rescue operation.

On 26 December, a Middle East Airlines plane carrying Lebanese Foreign Minister Jean Obeid and five army divers had arrived in Benin to assist with the rescue operation. Rescuers, however, stated that it was unlikely to find anymore survivors from the crash site. Rescuers attempted to recover the wreckage by using chains that were tied onto tractors. Meanwhile, both black boxes were recovered from the wreckage on 27 December.

A total of 141 bodies had been recovered by the rescuers, 12 of whom could not be identified. Initially, there were 27 survivors at the crash site but 5 people later succumbed to their injuries. Additionally, the report listed 7 missing people.

==Passengers and crews==
According to Lebanese Foreign Minister Jean Obeid, over a hundred of those on board were Lebanese. There were also people from Togo, Guinea, Kenya, Libya, Sierra Leone, Palestine, Peru, Syria, Nigeria, and also a youth wrestler from Iran. Among the passengers were 15 Bangladeshi UN peacekeepers returning from their duties in Sierra Leone and Liberia. A congressional report from the United States Senate indicated that there were officials related to Hezbollah&#x27;s West Africa operation on board Flight 141.

The manifest indicated that a total of 86 people, including 4 children and 3 babies, boarded the aircraft while it was in Conakry. Among the 86 passengers were 45 passengers from Sierra Leone, including the Bangladeshi peacekeepers who had boarded without transit checks. In Cotonou, a total of 9 passengers disembarked from the aircraft and 63 people, including 3 children and 2 babies, boarded the aircraft. The aircraft also received 10 passengers, including a child and a baby, from a transit flight that had originated from Togo. Based on the written manifest, the total number of passengers were 150, consisted of 138 adults, 8 children and 6 babies. The exact number of passengers on board, however, were impossible to determine, as more passengers were thought to be aboard than were listed on the manifest.

At the time of the accident, the aircraft was configured with 12 first-class seats, 138 economy seats, and 6 seats for flight attendants. There were five seats in the cockpit and 4 jump seats for the cabin crew.

All three flight crew members had previously flown for Libyan Arab Airlines, and had their first flight with the airline on 8 December 2003. All of the crew members were provided by Financial Advisory Group (FAG) as the owner of the aircraft. The captain was 49-year-old Najib al-Barouni with 11,000 flight hours, including 8,000 hours on the Boeing 727. His commercial pilot license was issued by the United Kingdom in 1977. He later obtained the Boeing 727 flying license in 1988 and joined FAG in March 2003. Prior to his work with UTA, he had flown for Royal Jordanian Airlines for 3 months and Trans Air Benin for 6 months. The first officer was 49-year-old Ahmad al-Harizi, whose flight information was not stated in the accident report. He had obtained his commercial pilot license in 1979, issued by the United Kingdom. The 45-year-old flight engineer, identified only as Miftah, had 14,000 flight hours, all on the Boeing 727.

There were 7 other crew members on board the aircraft, consisted of four flight attendants, two Peruvian ground mechanics and one transporter. There were also two UTA executives, including the Director General of UTA, aboard the aircraft. They were both seated at the cabin crew jump seats.

==Investigation==
The crash was the deadliest civil airliner crash in the history of Benin. It was also the first major aircraft accident in the country. Thus, the country didn&#x27;t have the experience to investigate the crash. While the government had set up a special commission to investigate the cause of the crash, the government requested the French BEA to carry out the probe. The investigation also invited representatives from Boeing and the FAA.

According to the final report, the investigation team faced great difficulties during their attempts to obtain adequate data and documentations from UTA.
The team had to rely to direct testimonies from the surviving crew members, reasonings, and calculations made from the available recorded parameters.

=== Weight and balance ===
Testimonies gathered from surviving passengers and crew members revealed that the crash might have been caused by the presence of a weight and balance problem. While investigators tried to examine this theory, they couldn&#x27;t retrieve the supposed weight and balance data from UTA. There were no documents on the weight of the aircraft and the loading plan for the flight between Conakry and Cotonou. Investigators could only retrieve the passenger manifest and the weight of the hold baggage. The weight and balance sheets, all of which were from the previous owner Alpha Omega Airlines, were later provided by the Lebanese investigators.

The basic operating weight of the aircraft, the actual weight of the aircraft and its equipment without the weight of the fuel, was determined to be at around , with the latter being the most likely. The real weight of the passengers, however, was unknown. The weight of the baggage was also difficult to determine as UTA&#x27;s check-in staffs had never limited the weight of the baggage to a specific weight. UTA&#x27;s standard allowed weight per adult passenger was , although prior flights revealed weight variations between . The weight of the passengers and the baggage was later determined to be between .

Calculation made by BEA, in addition with the aircraft&#x27;s fuel and other loads, concluded that the take-off weight of Flight 141 was somewhere between . A simulation was then conducted, with an aircraft setting of flaps at 25-degree, stabilizer at 6 and a declared weight of . The simulation revealed that the aircraft&#x27;s centre of gravity was still stable and balanced as the allowed centre of gravity was 19%. According to investigators, the aircraft would have managed to fly safely from the airport and shouldn&#x27;t have crashed onto the localizer building at the end of the runway.

=== Failure to take-off ===
The calculation was inconsistent with testimonies that had been gathered from survivors of the crash, in which overloading had caused the crash of Flight 141. Further confirmation based on the recorded parameter was later conducted by Boeing and investigators. The calculation later revealed that the aircraft was actually with a centre of gravity at 14%, much forward than the previous calculation. According to Boeing, with said calculation the aircraft would have required a much more rigorous and rapid input from the crew to pass the localizer building at the end of the runway.
The centre of gravity had significantly shifted to the front due to the improper loading by the baggage handler, later revealed that he never had a formal training, who had decided to load the already baggage-filled forward hold with more baggage rather than distributing the weight of the load properly. This was consistent with the recorded parameter, which showed the very slow response of the nose when the crew had tried to apply nose up input to the elevator.

With the centre of gravity value of 14%, the aircraft would have also required a greater setting of the stabilizer, which was at 7 rather than 6, for a much more effective take-off. By selecting the latter configuration, the aircraft would have taken off from the runway at a slower pace. The decision to select such configuration was caused by the crew&#x27;s reliance over their past experience. As UTA had not provided the required data for the crew, they had to rely to the configuration that they had used in prior flights and thus assumed that the configuration of 6 for the stabilizer was sufficient for take-off, as it was usual to use the declared weight of 78 tons and the centre of gravity of 19% for the take-off calculation.

As the crew selected the configuration, the aircraft would have needed a longer distance to take-off from Cotonou. The situation was worsened by the fact that the scheduled time for take-off was at noon, in which temperature was at its peak. Available weather data showed that the temperature at the time was at . The hot temperature at the time would have caused air density to decrease, inhibiting the aircraft&#x27;s ability to take-off. The shifted centre of gravity to the forward hold, combined with the insufficient configuration, the short runway and the hot temperature at the airport, caused the aircraft&#x27;s failure to take-off from Cotonou.

=== The operator ===
Prior to the operation of the Cotonou – Beirut route, UTA had been operating smaller routes in West Africa for years. The airline itself was a small regional airliner that was based in Guinea. It had relocated from its previous base in Sierra Leone from 1995 under the name West Coast. Before UTA managed to obtain Boeing 727, the airline had operated a Let L-410 Turbolet and an Antonov An-24 through a leasing contract. The Let L-410 was used for routes between multiple West African cities such as Freetown, Banjul and Abidjan, while the Antonov An-24 was used for mining companies and air ambulance.

The investigation revealed that all management posts in the airline had been filled with members of the same family with no knowledge whatsoever in aviation. The only non-family members in the airline was the technical director, who was responsible for the training, and the chief pilot, who was tasked on quality control, the latter was not competent enough for high capacity aircraft as he had not obtained the aircraft rating for Boeing 727.

UTA didn&#x27;t possess sufficient documents of its own fleet. The first Boeing 727 that had been acquired by the airline was lacking in proper documentations which prompted the Lebanese investigators to not allow the aircraft to be operated under Lebanese registration as its essential documents somehow belonged to other foreign airlines. To rectify the problem, UTA bought another Boeing 727, the accident aircraft, from Alpha and Omega Airways. UTA also could not provide the maintenance and inspection manual to investigators. They also could not provide the operation manual. The manual had to be provided by the Guinean authorities. Further examination revealed that the manual had been copy-pasted from numerous foreign airlines. For example, some of the wordings had been copy-pasted from aircraft activities in Jordan and Gaza.

The following findings were also noted: the absence of work time limit for the flight crew, absence of details relating to loading, weight and balance of an aircraft, non-existent structure of the airline and even non-existent departments within the airline. UTA was also not able to provide, according to the final report, the slightest data on the flights that had been performed, flying hours and periods of service of the crew.

Investigator also noted the following declaration, found within UTA&#x27;s document:
=== Oversight failure ===
Guinean authorities should have prevented the creation of UTA following the airline&#x27;s blatant disregard to the required regulations that it should have followed. The decision to let UTA to operate flights in the region raised questions on the oversight. Furthermore, Guinean authorities somehow managed to immediately pass multiple controversial decisions made by UTA, such as the copy-pasted manual and the extension flight to Dubai, without proper examinations. The same issue could be applied to authorities in Swaziland.

Failing in oversights could be attributed to the environment of the country, in which adherence to regulations was often overlooked. The final report, however, stressed that multiple factors should also be considered, such as economic reasons and other variety of reasons, rather than blaming the authorities in Swaziland and Guinea. West Africa had been suffering endless conflicts and political instability for years. An immediate punishment on the struggling region over its non-compliance with the supposed regulations would have caused a negative feedback. Even though Guinean authorities had ratified the Chicago Convention, the implementation of it basically didn&#x27;t exist. The international body that supervised the convention, ICAO, even stated in its 2001 report that Guinea had not established a regulatory mechanism on the country&#x27;s aviation industry.

The final report revealed the unequal ability of countries to conduct evaluation on another country&#x27;s adherence to the Chicago Convention. In response, ICAO was asked to actively help countries that were incapable of implementing aviation safety regulations to eventually develop a working system. A better transparency between countries that had ratified the convention was also ordered.

=== Conclusion ===
The final report was published in 2004. The crash was mainly caused by overloading and the improper baggage loading of the Boeing 727. However, the investigation team also listed the structural causes that eventually enabled the overloading condition of the aircraft. The BEA listed the cause as the following:

Following the accident, BEA issued recommendations to multiple international aviation bodies for better oversight of airliners within their scope of operation. The report also asked the United States FAA and Europe EASA to create an autonomous system for measuring weight and balance. Subsequently, all aircraft should be retrofitted with said system.

==Aftermath==
In response to the crash, the government of Benin declared three-days of national mourning. The then United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan expressed his condolences to the relatives of the crash, particularly to the families of the 15 UN peacekeepers. United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) later sent 11 members of a coordination team to Cotonou for the repatriation. On 28 December, a repatriation ceremony was held in Cotonou for 77 Lebanese victims and 2 Iranians. A French military aircraft had been ordered to carry the coffins to Beirut. The aircraft arrived in Beirut on the next day and another repatriation ceremony was held, attended by Lebanese President Émile Lahoud, Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, Speaker of the House Nabih Berri and Muslim clerics.

The crash of Flight 141 revealed another source of influx of cash for Hezbollah, a prominent Lebanese Shiite militant group, from countries in West Africa. Among the passengers was a Hezbollah official carrying US$2 million that had been raised by supporters of Hezbollah in West Africa. A report made by United States Congress revealed a vast network of wealthy Lebanese nationals in multiple West African countries who had supported Hezbollah campaigns and provided funds to the organization. The report further accused Hezbollah of blood diamond trade and other illicit activities with local drug traffickers in the region, which was already known for its notorious drug trafficking alliances.

In October 2010, a Lebanese court sentenced the captain of the flight, Najib al-Barouni, to 20 years in prison after being found guilty of neglect. The court also sentenced Imad Saba, a Palestinian-American owner of the aircraft, UTA general manager Ahmed Khazem and UTA operations chief Mohammed Khazem to prison with serving time ranging from 3 months to 3 years. All of them were ordered to provide compensations with a total of US$930,000 to the relatives of the victims.

<text>Elizabeth of Hungary (, , ; 7 July 120717 November 1231), also known as Elisabeth of Thuringia, was a princess of the Kingdom of Hungary and the landgravine of Thuringia.

Elizabeth was married at the age of 14, and widowed at 20. After her husband&#x27;s death, she regained her dowry, using the money to build a hospital where she herself served the sick. She became a symbol of Christian charity after her death in 1231 at the age of 24 and was canonized on 25 May 1235. She is venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church. She was an early member of the Third Order of St. Francis, and is today honored as its patroness.

==Early life and marriage==
Elizabeth was the daughter of King Andrew II of Hungary and Gertrude of Merania. Her mother&#x27;s sister was Hedwig of Andechs, wife of Duke Henry I of Silesia. Her ancestry included many notable figures of European royalty, going back as far as Vladimir the Great of the Kievan Rus&#x27;.

According to tradition, she was born in Hungary, possibly in the castle of Sárospatak, on 7 July 1207. However, a sermon printed in 1497 by the Franciscan friar Osvaldus de Lasco, a church official in Hungary, is the first source to specifically name Sárospatak as Elizabeth&#x27;s birthplace, potentially building on local tradition. Osvaldus also translates the miracle of the roses to Elizabeth&#x27;s childhood in Sárospatak and has her leave Hungary at the age of five.

According to a different tradition she was born in Pozsony, Hungary (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia), where she lived in the Castle of Posonium until the age of four. Elizabeth was brought to the court of the rulers of Thuringia in central Germany, to be betrothed to Louis IV, Landgrave of Thuringia (also known as Ludwig IV), a future union which would reinforce political alliances between the two families. She was raised by the Thuringian court and would have been familiar with the local language and culture.

In 1221, at the age of fourteen, Elizabeth married Louis; the same year he was enthroned as landgrave, and the marriage appears to have been happy.

===Religious inclinations, influences===
In 1223, Franciscan friars arrived, and the teenage Elizabeth not only learned about the ideals of Francis of Assisi, but started to live them. Louis was not upset by his wife&#x27;s charitable efforts, believing that the distribution of his wealth to the poor would bring eternal reward; he is venerated in Thuringia as a saint, though he was never canonized by the church.

It was also about this time that the priest and later inquisitor Konrad von Marburg gained considerable influence over Elizabeth when he was appointed as her confessor. In the spring of 1226, when floods, famine and plague wrought havoc in Thuringia, Louis, a staunch supporter of the Hohenstaufen Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, represented Frederick II at the Imperial Diet held in Cremona.

Elizabeth assumed control of affairs at home and distributed alms in all parts of their territory, even giving away state robes and ornaments to the poor.

==Widowhood==

Elizabeth&#x27;s life changed irrevocably on 11 September 1227 when Louis, en route to join the Sixth Crusade, died of a fever in Otranto, Italy, just a few weeks before the birth of her daughter Gertrude. Upon hearing the news of her husband&#x27;s death, the 20-year-old Elizabeth reportedly said, &quot;He is dead. He is dead. It is to me as if the whole world died today.&quot; His remains were returned to Elizabeth in 1228 and entombed at the abbey of Reinhardsbrunn.

After Louis&#x27; death, his brother, Henry Raspe, assumed the regency during the minority of Elizabeth&#x27;s eldest child, Hermann (1222–1241). After bitter arguments over the disposal of her dowry—a conflict in which Konrad was appointed as the official Defender of her case by Pope Gregory IX—Elizabeth left the court at Wartburg and moved to Marburg in Hesse. Her move seems to have been partly influenced by Konrad&#x27;s strict dietary commands, which could not be met at Wartburg.

Following her husband&#x27;s death, Elizabeth made solemn vows to Konrad similar to those of a nun. These vows included celibacy, as well as complete obedience to Konrad as her confessor and spiritual director. Konrad&#x27;s treatment of Elizabeth was extremely harsh, and he held her to standards of behavior which were almost impossible to meet. Among the punishments he is alleged to have ordered were physical beatings; he also ordered her to send away her three children. Her pledge to celibacy proved a hindrance to her family&#x27;s political ambitions. Elizabeth was more or less held hostage at Pottenstein, the castle of her uncle, Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg, in an effort to force her to remarry. Elizabeth, however, held fast to her vow, even threatening to cut off her own nose so that no man would find her attractive enough to marry.

Elizabeth&#x27;s second child Sophie of Thuringia (1224–1275) married Henry II, Duke of Brabant, and was the ancestress of the Landgraves of Hesse, since in the War of the Thuringian Succession she won Hesse for her son Heinrich I, called &quot;the Child&quot;. Elizabeth&#x27;s third child, Gertrude of Altenberg (1227–1297), was born several weeks after the death of her father; she became abbess of the monastery of Altenberg Abbey, Hesse near Wetzlar.

Elizabeth built a hospital at Marburg for the poor and the sick with the money from her dowry, where she and her companions cared for them.

==The Miracles==
===Miracle of the roses===
The popular legend of the miracle of the roses was originally attributed to Elizabeth of Portugal, is absent from Elizabeth of Thuringia&#x27;s earliest hagiography and was only later attributed to the latter. It also appears in that of many other saints.

The version attributing it to Elizabeth of Hungary states that, while taking bread to the poor in secret, she met her husband Louis on a hunting party (or in some versions Louis&#x27; brother Heinrich Raspe), to quell suspicions of the gentry that she was stealing treasure from the castle, asked her to reveal what was hidden under her cloak. In that moment, her cloak fell open and a vision of white and red roses could be seen, which proved to Louis that God&#x27;s protecting hand was at work. However, this contradicts her &quot;vitae&quot;, which state that her husband was never troubled by her charity and always supported it.

===Christ in the bed===
Another story told of Elizabeth, also found in Dietrich of Apolda&#x27;s &quot;Vita&quot;, relates how she laid the leper Helias of Eisenach in the bed she shared with her husband. Her mother-in-law, who was horrified, told this immediately to Louis on his return. When Louis removed the bedclothes in great indignation, at that instant &quot;Almighty God opened the eyes of his soul, and instead of a leper he saw the figure of Christ crucified stretched upon the bed.&quot; This story also appears in Franz Liszt&#x27;s oratorio about Elizabeth.

==Death and legacy==


Elizabeth died in Marburg at the age of twenty-four, on 17 November 1231.

===Miracles after death and canonization===
Very soon after the death of Elizabeth, miracles were reported that happened at her grave in the church of the hospital, especially those of healing. On the suggestion of Konrad, and by papal command, examinations were held of those who had been healed between August 1232 and January 1235. The results of those examinations was supplemented by a brief &quot;vita&quot; of the saint-to-be, and together with the testimony of Elizabeth&#x27;s handmaidens and companions (bound in a booklet called the &quot;Libellus de dictis quatuor ancillarum s. Elizabeth confectus&quot;), proved sufficient reason for quick canonization. She was canonized by Pope Gregory IX on 24 May 1235.

The papal bull declaring her a saint is on display in the &quot;Schatzkammer&quot; of the &quot;Deutschordenskirche&quot; in Vienna. Her body was laid in a magnificent golden shrine—still to be seen today—in the &quot;Elisabethkirche&quot; in Marburg. Marburg became a center of the Teutonic Order, which adopted Saint Elizabeth as its secondary patroness. The Order remained in Marburg until its official dissolution by Napoleon in 1803. The &quot;Elisabethkirche&quot; is now a Protestant church, but has spaces set aside for Catholic worship.

Elizabeth&#x27;s shrine became one of the main German centers of pilgrimage of the 14th century and early 15th century. During the course of the 15th century, the popularity of the cult of Saint Elizabeth slowly faded, though to some extent this was mitigated by an aristocratic devotion to St Elizabeth, since through her daughter Sophia she was an ancestor of many leading aristocratic German families.

Three hundred years after her death, one of Elizabeth&#x27;s many descendants, Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, a leader of the Protestant Reformation, raided the church in Marburg. He demanded that the Teutonic Order hand over Elizabeth&#x27;s bones, in order to disperse her relics and thus put an end to the already declining pilgrimages to Marburg. Philip took away the crowned agate chalice in which her head rested, but returned it after being imprisoned by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor.

The reliquary chalice was subsequently plundered by Swedish troops during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, and is now on display at the Swedish History Museum. Her skull and some of her bones can be seen at the convent in Vienna bearing her name. A portion of her relics were kept in the church of the Carmelites in Brussels; another in the magnificent chapel of La Roche-Guyon, and a considerable part in a precious shrine is in the electoral treasury of Hanover. Another part of her relics were taken to Bogotá, then the capital of the Spanish New Kingdom of Granada, by friar Luis Zapata de Cárdenas. The relics are today inside a chapel dedicated to the saint in the Primatial Cathedral of Bogotá.

Elizabeth of Hungary is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 18 November and in the Episcopal Church on 19 November.

===Association with the Franciscans===
After her death, Elizabeth was commonly associated with the Third Order of Saint Francis, the primarily lay branch of the Franciscan Order, which has helped propagate her cult. Whether she ever actually joined the order, only recently founded in 1221, the year when she married Louis at the age of fourteen, is not proven to everyone&#x27;s satisfaction.

It must be kept in mind though that the Third Order was such a new development in the Franciscan movement, that no one official ritual had been established at that point. Elizabeth clearly had a ceremony of consecration in which she adopted a Franciscan religious habit in her new way of life, as noted above.

Because of her support of the friars sent to Thuringia, she was made known to the founder, St Francis of Assisi, who sent her a personal message of blessing shortly before his death in 1226. Upon her canonization, she was declared the patron saint of the Third Order of St Francis, an honor she shares with St Louis IX of France.

==Depiction in art and music==
Saint Elizabeth is often depicted holding a basket of bread, or some other sort of food or beverage, characteristic of her devotion to the poor and hungry. The &quot;miracle of the roses&quot; has also proved a popular theme for artists.
Peter Janssens composed a musical play (&quot;Musikspiel&quot;) &quot;Elisabeth von Thüringen&quot; in 1984 on a libretto by .

In Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s novel &quot;Villette&quot;, the Protestant narrator includes the story of Elizabeth&#x27;s involvement with von Marburg as one of several Catholic stories of confessors &quot;who had wickedly abused their office, trampling to deep degradation high-born ladies, making of countesses and princesses the most tormented slaves under the sun.&quot;

==2007 octocentennial celebrations==
The year 2007 was proclaimed Elizabeth Year in Marburg. All year, events commemorating Elizabeth&#x27;s life and works were held, culminating in a town-wide festival to celebrate the 800th anniversary of her birth on 7 July 2007. Pilgrims came from all over the world for the occasion, which ended with a special service in the Elisabeth Church that evening.

A new musical based on Elizabeth&#x27;s life, &quot;Elisabeth--die Legende einer Heiligen&quot; (&quot;Elizabeth--Legend of a Saint&quot;), starring Sabrina Weckerlin as Elizabeth, Armin Kahn as Ludwig, and Chris Murray as Konrad, premiered in Eisenach in 2007. It was performed in Eisenach and Marburg for two years, and closed in Eisenach in July 2009.

The entire Third Order of St. Francis, both the friars and sisters of the Third Order Regular and the Secular Franciscan Order, joined in this celebration through a two-year-long program of study of her life. This was conducted throughout the Order, across the globe. There were also religious ceremonies held worldwide during that period. The yearlong observance of the centennial which began on her feast day in 2007 was closed at the General Chapter of the Order, held in Budapest in 2008. The New York region of the Order produced a movie of her life, produced by a sister of the Order, Lori Pieper.

==Ancestry==
==Honors==
Saint Elizabeth of Hungary: On the 700-year anniversary of her death, Hungary issued a set of four stamps in her honor: on 21 April 1932; on 1 August 1944 one postage stamp was issued; on 16 July 1938 Czechoslovakia issued a stamp in her honor showing the Cathedral of St. Elizabeth in Košice. She was declared the patron saint of the same city in 2019.

The hymn &quot;Wenn das Brot, das wir teilen&quot;, written for a pilgrimage to places in Thuringia connected to her life, refers to her Miracle of the roses, and mentions other works of charity.

<text>Dr Challoner&#x27;s High School, abbreviated to DCHS, is a grammar school for girls between the ages of 11 and 18, located in Buckinghamshire, England. In August 2011 the school became an Academy.

In September 2001, the school was awarded specialist school status as a Sports College, by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES). It was also awarded a second specialism as a Language College. It is an affiliate member of the Girls&#x27; Schools Association. In 2011, Ofsted judged the school to be Outstanding and in 2014 DCHS achieved the Exceptional Schools Award.

==History==

The school was established in 1962 as an all-girls&#x27; school, when the previously mixed Dr Challoner&#x27;s Grammar School became an all-boys&#x27; school, due to increasing roll numbers.

==Entry==
To gain entry to the school, pupils from primary schools in the local area are invited to do the 11-plus exam. Entry to a grammar school usually requires a score of 121/141, though pupils who gain scores of below 121 are invited to appeal their case. Prospective pupils who did not take the 11+ (e.g. those who join in later years) also take the school&#x27;s own entry test.

==House system==
The school operates a house system, with girls being placed in one of the six houses at the start of their time at the school along with the rest of their forms. The six houses are named after notable women in history and each have a corresponding colour: Bronte is blue, Curie is green, Nightingale is purple, Pankhurst is yellow, Teresa is red and Rosa is orange. Six girls in the upper sixth are appointed the head of houses each year. The houses play a part in music and sports in the school, with girls earning points for winning competitions and events, in particular interhouse, a sports half-day competition occurring once a term for years 7–11. At the end of each academic year one house will win the house cup for having the most points.

==Facilities and classes==

===Initial subjects===
Pupils are introduced to a wide range of subjects from Year 7, including Computer Science, Art, Music and Drama. Pupils study French, German and Spanish for the first year. In years 8 and 9 the students study Latin, in turn dropping one of their other two languages, before continuing on with at least one language at GCSE level.

All pupils take at least eight subjects for GCSE, although most take 9 or 10 subjects. Three A levels are taken by most students but in the case of certain subjects (further maths, music etc.), or outstanding achievement at GCSE, students may take four. The vast majority of pupils go on to university or some form of higher education.

===School buildings===
The Tower Block: Humanity subjects, Religious Studies, History and Geography are taught here, as well as Classics and Latin. This building was part of the school when it first opened in 1962.
The Science Block: Also part of the school when it first opened, the three sciences are taught here. The art rooms were previously situated upstairs but have been renovated to become new science rooms.
The Curve Building: Added in the early 1980s, extended in 1992 and again in 1998, English, Maths and Art are taught here. The library is also situated in this building, as is the Sixth Form Common Room and the Careers Room. The curved space between the Curved Building and the Tower Block creates a naturally sloped outdoor theatre area.
The Modern Foreign Languages Building: Known as the MFL Block, French, Spanish and German are taught here, although the Music teaching and practice rooms and also one physics laboratory are attached to it. 
The Sports Hall: Completed in 2002, most indoor sports lessons are held here. There are changing rooms with showers available. The school fields and Tennis, Netball and astro-turf courts are situated by this building.

The school&#x27;s original gym and a dance and drama studio, built more recently, were knocked down to make way for a new drama complex, completed around 2009 with the help of fundraising and donations from parents. There is also a canteen and Main Hall at the front of the school, attached to the Tower Block and part of the original school of 1962.

==Notable achievements==
In 2014 the school was awarded Exceptional Schools Award by the Best Practice Network, only the ninth school in the whole country to receive the award after an extensive inspection. In 2011 DCHS was judged to be an Outstanding school by OFSTED.

In 2008, Dr Challoner&#x27;s High achieved the best A Level results of any Buckinghamshire state school with an A/B pass rate of 84%. At GCSE the A*/A grade pass rate was 81% and over a third of girls achieved all A*/As. The school has appeared in the Times Parent Power school league tables; 31st best state school in 2007, 16th in 2008 and 23rd in 2009, each time being the top state school in Buckinghamshire. Ofsted rated &#x27;Grade 1 – Outstanding&#x27; in its last inspection of the school in 2011.

In 2010 the school achieved another set of outstanding A Level results. 22.3% of entries were graded A*, a higher figure than any other Buckinghamshire school. Over 88% of entries were graded A*-B.

In recent years the school has also won Good Schools&#x27; Guide awards in History, Politics and Spanish. The Politics department won the top prize, achieving the best A Level results of any school in England for the period 2004–06. In addition to its academic success, the school has a proud reputation for sporting success, recently winning the national U16 basketball title and the tennis team were national runners-up in the year 8 and under Nestle School Teams Tennis competition. In December 2008 the school won the national junior cross-country championships held in Leicestershire.

==Debating==

The school has a debating society which enters the Oxford and Cambridge competitions, with the UCL, Durham and Bristol university competitions also featuring in recent years. The International Competition for Young Debaters (ICYD) has been a mainstay for the school&#x27;s younger debaters. In 2010 the school also entered a new competition at SOAS and in the recent past several girls have participated in trials for the England team.

In February 2008 a Challoner&#x27;s team won the regional round of the Oxford Union schools&#x27; competition. The school&#x27;s record in the Oxford competition in particular is excellent; with at least 1 team breaking to finals day almost every year. In the 2008–09 academic year the school also came 5th (out of 48 teams) in the UCL senior competition and in the Oxford finals in the same year reached the top 15 to make two of the school&#x27;s debaters eligible for England trials in the autumn term of 2009.

In the 2009–10 season the school&#x27;s top pair won the schools&#x27; debating tournament at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) coming top out of 75 pairs from some of the best debating schools in England. The pair also made it through to the semi-final of the Durham University schools&#x27; competition finishing in 7th place overall from over 100 teams. In March 2010 the same pair achieved 6th place (out of 88 teams) in the Oxford Union competition overcoming schools such as Dulwich College, University College School and Marlborough, and just behind St Paul&#x27;s boys and Westminster.

<doc id="414408" wikidata="Q7636884" url="?curid=414408" title="Sum-addressed decoder">
<text>In CPU design, the use of a sum-addressed decoder (SAD) or sum-addressed memory (SAM) decoder is a method of reducing the latency of the CPU cache access and address calculation (base + offset). This is achieved by fusing the address generation sum operation with the decode operation in the cache SRAM.

==Overview==
The L1 data cache should usually be in the most critical CPU resource, because few things improve instructions per cycle (IPC) as directly as a larger data cache, a larger data cache takes longer to access, and pipelining the data cache makes IPC worse. One way of reducing the latency of the L1 data cache access is by fusing the address generation sum operation with the decode operation in the cache SRAM.

The address generation sum operation still must be performed, because other units in the memory pipe will use the resulting virtual address. That sum will be performed in parallel with the fused add/decode described here.

The most profitable recurrence to accelerate is a load, followed by a use of that load in a chain of integer operations leading to another load. Assuming that load results are bypassed with the same priority as integer results, then it&#x27;s possible to summarize this recurrence as a load followed by another load—as if the program was following a linked list.

The rest of this page assumes an instruction set architecture (ISA) with a single addressing mode (register+offset), a virtually indexed data cache, and sign-extending loads that may be variable-width. Most RISC ISAs fit this description. In ISAs such as the Intel x86, three or four inputs are summed to generate the virtual address. Multiple-input additions can be reduced to a two-input addition with carry save adders, and the remaining problem is as described below. The critical recurrence, then, is an adder, a decoder, the SRAM word line, the SRAM bit line(s), the sense amp(s), the byte steering muxes, and the bypass muxes.

For this example, a direct-mapped 16 KB data cache which returns doubleword (8-byte) aligned values is assumed. Each line of the SRAM is 8 bytes, and there are 2048 lines, addressed by Addr[13:3]. The sum-addressed SRAM idea applies equally well to set associative caches.

==Sum-addressed cache: collapse the adder and decoder==
The SRAM decoder for this example has an 11-bit input, Addr[13:3], and 2048 outputs, the decoded word lines. One word line is driven high in response to each unique Addr[13:3] value.

In the simplest form of decoder, each of the 2048 lines is logically an AND gate. The 11 bits (call them A[13:3] and their complements (call them B[13:3]) are driven up the decoder. For each line, 11 bits or complements are fed into an 11-input AND gate. For instance, 1026 decimal is equal to 10000000010 binary. The function for line 1026 would be:

 wordline[1026] = A[13] &amp; B[12] &amp; B[11] &amp; B[10] &amp; B[9] &amp; B[8] &amp; B[7] &amp; B[6] &amp; B[5] &amp; A[4] &amp; B[3]

Both the carry chain of the adder and the decoder combine information from the entire width of the index portion of the address. Combining information across the entire width twice is redundant. A sum-addressed SRAM combines the information just once by implementing the adder and decoder together in one structure.

Recall that the SRAM is indexed with the result of an add. Call the summands R (for register) and O (for the offset to that register). The sum-addressed decoder is going to decode R+O. For each decoder line, call the line number L.

Suppose that our decoder drove both R and O over each decoder line, and each decoder line implemented:

 wordline[L] = (R+O)==L

 (R+O)==L &lt;=&gt; R+O-L==0
 &lt;=&gt; R+O+~L+1==0
 &lt;=&gt; R+O+~L==-1==11..1.

A set of full adders can be used to reduce R+O+~L to S+C (this is carry save addition). S+C==11..1 &lt;=&gt; S==~C. There will be no carries in the final add. Note that since C is a row of carries, it&#x27;s shifted up one bit, so that R[13:3]+O[13:3]+~L[13:3] == {0,S[13:3]} + {C[14:4],0}

With this formulation, each row in the decoder is a set of full adders which reduce the base register, the offset, and the row number to a carry-save format, and a comparator. Most of this hardware will be proven redundant below, but for now it&#x27;s simpler to think of it all existing in each row.

==Ignoring the LSBs: late select on carry==
The formulation above checks the entire result of an add. However, in a CPU cache decoder, the entire result of the add is a byte address, and the cache is usually indexed with a larger address, in our example, that of an 8-byte block. It is preferable to ignore a few of the LSBs of the address. However, the LSBs of the two summands can&#x27;t be ignored because they may produce a carry-out which would change the doubleword addressed.

If R[13:3] and O[13:3] are added to get some index I[13:3], then the actual address Addr[13:3] is equal to either I[13:3], or I[13:3] + 1, depending on whether R[2:0]+O[2:0] generates a carry-out. Both I and I+1 can be fetched if there are two banks of SRAM, one with even addresses and one with odd. The even bank holds addresses 000xxx, 010xxx, 100xxx, 110xxx, etc., and the odd bank holds addresses 001xxx, 011xxx, 101xxx, 111xxx, etc. The carry-out from R[2:0]+O[2:0] can then be used to select the even or odd doubleword fetched later.

Note that fetching from two half-size banks of SRAM will dissipate more power than fetching from one full-size bank, as it causes more switching in the sense amps and data steering logic.

==Match generation==
Referring to the adjacent diagram, the even bank will fetch line 110 when I[13:3]==101 or I[13:3]==110. The odd bank will fetch line 101 when I[13:3]==100 or I[13:3]==101.

In general, the odd SRAM bank should fetch line Lo==2N+1 when either I[13:3]==2N or I[13:3]==2N+1. The two conditions can be written as:

 I[13:3] = Lo-1 =&gt; R[13:3] + O[13:3] + ~Lo+1 = 11..11
 =&gt; R[13:3] + O[13:3] + ~Lo = 11..10
 I[13:3] = Lo =&gt; R[13:3] + O[13:3] + ~Lo = 11..11

Ignore the last digit of the compare: (S+C)[13:4]==11..1

Similarly, the even SRAM bank fetches line Le==2N when either I[13:3]==2N or I[13:3]==2N-1. The conditions are written as follows, and once again ignore the last digit of the compare.

 I[13:3] = Le-1 =&gt; R[13:3] + O[13:3] + ~Le = 11..10
 I[13:3] = Le =&gt; R[13:3] + O[13:3] + ~Le = 11..11

==Gate-level implementation==

 R13 ... R6 R5 R4 R3
 O13 ... O6 O5 O4 O3
 L13 ... L6 L5 L4 L3
 S13 ... S6 S5 S4 S3
 C14 C13 ... C6 C5 C4
Before collapsing redundancy between rows, review:

Each row of each decoder for each of two banks implements a set of full adders which reduce the three numbers to be added (R[13:3], O[13:3], and L) to two numbers (S[14:4] and C[13:3]). The LSB (==S[3]) is discarded. Carry out (==C[14]) is also discarded. The row matches if S[13:4] == ~C[13:4], which is &amp;( xor(S[13:4], C[13:4])).

It is possible to partially specialize the full adders to 2-input AND, OR, XOR, and XNOR because the L input is constant. The resulting expressions are common to all lines of the decoder and can be collected at the bottom.

 S0;i = S(Ri, Oi, 0) = Ri xor Oi
 S1;i = S(Ri, Oi, 1) = Ri xnor Oi
 C0;i+1 = C(Ri, Oi, 0) = Ri and Oi
 C1;i+1 = C(Ri, Oi, 1) = Ri or Oi.

At each digit position, there are only two possible Si,
two possible Ci, and four possible XORs between them:

 Li=0 and Li-1=0: X0;0;i = S0;i xor C0;i = Ri xor Oi xor (Ri-1 and Oi-1)
 Li=0 and Li-1=1: X0;1;i = S0;i xor C1;i = Ri xor Oi xor (Ri-1 or Oi-1)
 Li=1 and Li-1=0: X1;0;i = S1;i xor C0;i = Ri xnor Oi xor (Ri-1 and Oi-1) = !X0;0;i
 Li=1 and Li-1=1: X1;1;i = S1;i xor C1;i = Ri xnor Oi xor (Ri-1 or Oi-1) = !X0;1;i

One possible decoder for the example might calculate these four expressions for each of the bits 4..13, and drive all 40 wires up the decoder. Each line of the decoder would select one of the four wires for each bit, and consist of a 10-input AND.

==What has been saved?==
A simpler data cache path would have an adder followed by a traditional decoder. For our example cache subsystem, the critical path would be a 14-bit adder, producing true and complement values, followed by an 11-bit AND gate for each row of the decoder.

In the sum-addressed design, the final AND gate in the decoder remains, although 10 bits wide instead of 11. The adder has been replaced by a four input logical expression at each bit. The latency savings comes from the speed difference between the adder and that four input expression, a savings of perhaps three simple CMOS gates.

If the reader feels that this was an inordinate amount of brain-twisting work for a three gate improvement in a multi-cycle critical path, then the reader has a better appreciation for the level to which modern CPUs are optimized.

==Further optimizations: predecode==
Many decoder designs avoid high-fan-in AND gates in the decode line itself by employing a predecode stage. For instance, an 11-bit decoder might be predecoded into three groups of 4, 4, and 3 bits each. Each 3-bit group would drive 8 wires up the main decode array, each 4-bit group would drive 16 wires. The decoder line then becomes a 3-input AND gate. This reorganization can save significant implementation area and some power.

This same reorganization can be applied to the sum-addressed decoder. Each bit in the non-predecoded formulation above can be viewed as a local two-bit add. With predecoding, each predecode group is a local three, four, or even five-bit add, with the predecode groups overlapping by one bit.

Predecoding generally increases the number of wires traversing the decoder, and sum-addressed decoders generally have about twice as many wires as the equivalent simple decoder. These wires can be the limiting factor on the amount of feasible predecoding.

<text>The genus Empidonax is a group of small insect-eating passerine birds in the tyrant flycatcher family, the Tyrannidae. The genus name &quot;Empidonax&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;empis&quot;, &quot;gnat&quot;, and &quot;anax&quot;, &quot;master&quot;.

Most of these birds are very similar in plumage: olive on the upper parts with light underparts, eye rings and wing bars. In the nesting season they may be distinguished by range, habitat and call; in other situations, particularly on migration and in winter, it may not be possible to be sure of specific identification.

&quot;Empidonax&quot; flycatchers often flick their wings and tails rapidly.

Euler&#x27;s flycatcher, &quot;Lathrotriccus euleri&quot; and gray-breasted flycatcher, &quot;Lathrotriccus griseipectus&quot; were formerly placed in &quot;Empidonax&quot;, but differ anatomically and biochemically and are now placed in the genus &quot;Lathrotriccus&quot;.

==Species==
The genus contains 14 species:

<text>Incorporation is the formation of a new corporation. The corporation may be a business, a nonprofit organization, sports club, or a local government of a new city or town.

==In the United States==

Specific incorporation requirements in the United States differ on a state by state basis. However, there are common pieces of information that states require to be included in the certificate of incorporation.

*Business purpose
*Corporation name
*Registered agent
*Inc.
*Share par value
*Number of authorized shares of stock
*Directors
*Preferred shares
*Officers
*Legal address

A business purpose describes the incorporated tasks a company has to do or provide. The purpose can be general, indicating that the budding company has been formed to carry out &quot;all lawful business&quot; in the region. Alternatively, the purpose can be specific, furnishing a more detailed explanation of the products and/or services to be offered by their company.

The chosen name should be followed with a corporate identifier such as &quot;Corp.&quot;, &quot;Inc.&quot;, or &quot;Co.&quot;. A preliminary name availability search is advisable prior to the submission of the Articles of Incorporation. In the case of online incorporation, the state will have the final say with regards to the name chosen for the company. The name should not deceive or mislead consumers.

Registered agents are people or entities responsible for receiving all legal and tax documentation on behalf of the corporation.

Share per value refers to the stated minimum value and generally doesn&#x27;t correspond to the actual share value. In reality, the value of a share is based on its fair market value or the amount a buyer is willing to pay. An Inc. stipulates the exact number of shares the corporation is willing to authorize. It is mandatory for every corporation to have stock. If the corporation is willing to permit both preferred as well as common shares of stock, then this should have a mention in the articles of incorporation, along with the voting rights information. Generally, preferred shares provide their shareholders with preferential payments of distributions of assets or dividends in case the company shuts down its operations. Many small business owners only issue shares of common stock.

===Legal benefits===

There are a number of legal benefits that come with incorporation.

One significant legal benefit is the protection of personal assets against the claims of creditors and lawsuits. Sole proprietors and general partners in a partnership are personally and jointly responsible for all the legal liability (LL) of a business such as loans, accounts payable, and legal judgments. In a corporation, however, shareholders, directors and officers typically are not liable for the company&#x27;s debts and obligations. They are limited in liability to the amount they have invested in the corporation. For example, if a shareholder purchased $100 in stock, no more than $100 can be lost. On the other hand, a corporation (Corp.) or a limited liability company (LLC) may hold assets such as real estate, cars or boats. If a shareholder of a corporation is personally involved in a lawsuit or bankruptcy, these assets may be protected. A creditor of a shareholder of a Corp. or LLC cannot seize the assets of the company. However, the creditor may be able to seize ownership shares in the corporation, as they are considered a personal asset.

In the United States, corporations can sometimes be taxed at a lower rate than individuals. Also, corporations can own shares in other corporations and receive corporate dividends 80% tax-free. There are no limits on the amount of losses a corporation may carry forward to subsequent tax years. A sole proprietorship, on the other hand, cannot claim a capital loss greater than $3,000 unless the owner has offsetting capital gains.

A corporation is capable of continuing indefinitely. Its existence is not affected by the death of shareholders, directors, or officers of the corporation. Ownership in a Corp. or LLC is easily transferable to others, either in whole or in part. Some state laws are particularly corporate-friendly. For example, the transfer of ownership in a corporation incorporated in US-DE is not required to be filed or recorded.

===Legal history of incorporation in the United States===
Legal opinion on corporations has evolved significantly throughout history, and Supreme Court cases provide a means to observe this evolution. While these cases may seem arbitrary and decontextualized when examined individually, when viewed successively and within historical context, a narrative emerges that offers an explanation for why such views are upheld.

====&quot;Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward&quot;, 1819====

In 1816, the New Hampshire state legislature passed a bill intended to turn privately owned Dartmouth College into a publicly owned university with a board of trustees appointed by the governor. The board filed a suit challenging the constitutionality of the legislation. The suit alleged that the college enjoyed the right to contract and the government changing that contract was not allowed. Chief Justice John Marshall delivered the majority opinion and affirmed that the right to contract exists between owners of private property rather than between a government and its citizens. The case was the first in US history to raise fundamental questions about corporate entities and the protections they enjoy. It also set a precedent by extending &quot;individual rights&quot; to corporations.

====&quot;Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad&quot;, 1886====
The railroad was an expensive multi-year project that greatly changed and altered both the physical and commercial landscape of the country. As with most new technological developments that have a broad impact, there are disputes about how those technologies and the businesses they support fit under the umbrella of laws that govern regulations and taxation. In 1886 one such taxation dispute arose between Santa Clara County and Southern Pacific Railroad. The railroad thought the tax code was misapplied to some of their property and assets. In deciding the case, a unanimous court ruled that governments must abide by the same tax code enforcement for individuals that it did for corporations. While not explicitly stated in the case, it was implied that this case extended equal protection rights to corporations under the 14th amendment.

====&quot;Liggett v. Lee&quot;, 1933====
The booming economy the railroad corporations helped build from the late 19th into the early 20th centuries came to a screeching halt in 1929. The Great Depression, as it came to be known, helped a view of corporations emerge that put them at odds with the average worker. The election of Franklin D. Roosevelt reflected many populist sentiments. In 1933 a Florida case came before the court, again disputing taxation. In &quot;Liggett v. Lee&quot; the court ruled that there could be a corporate tax, essentially saying the structure of business was a justifiably discriminatory criterion for governments to consider when writing tax legislation. 

====&quot;First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti&quot;, 1978====
From 1940 to 1990 the percent of total GDP made up by financial service professionals increased by 300%. Along with that growth there was a growth in the profits this industry experienced as well. As the disposable income of banks and other financial institutions rose, they sought a way to use it to influence politics and policy. In response, Massachusetts passed a law limiting corporate donations strictly to issues related to their industry. The First National Bank of Boston challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and won. &quot;First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti&quot; allowed business to use financial speech in political causes of any nature.

====&quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot;, 2010====
In 2010 amidst an outpouring of frustration and blame directed at Wall Street the issue of corporate contributions came before the court again. In &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot; the court said there was virtually no distinction between monetary contributions and political speech, and because we do not limit political speech unless it is tantamount to bribery, corporations have the right as people to donate unlimited amounts of money to any political cause so long as it is not to a direct campaign.

===Steps required for incorporation===
The articles of incorporation (also called a charter, certificate of incorporation or letters patent) are filed with the appropriate state office, listing the purpose of the corporation, its principal place of business and the number and type of shares of stock. A registration fee is due, which is usually between $25 and $1,000, depending on the state.

A corporate name is generally made up of three parts: &quot;distinctive element&quot;, &quot;descriptive element&quot;, and a legal ending. All corporations must have a distinctive element, and in most filing jurisdictions, a legal ending to their names. Some corporations choose not to have a descriptive element. In the name &quot;Tiger Computers, Inc.&quot;, the word &quot;Tiger&quot; is the distinctive element; the word &quot;Computers&quot; is the descriptive element; and the &quot;Inc.&quot; is the legal ending. The legal ending indicates that it is in fact a legal corporation and not just a business registration or partnership. Incorporated, limited, and corporation, or their respective abbreviations (Inc., Ltd., Corp.) are the possible legal endings in the US.

Usually, there are also corporate bylaws which must be filed with the state. Bylaws outline a number of important administrative details such as when annual shareholder meetings will be held, who can vote and the manner in which shareholders will be notified if there is need for an additional &quot;special&quot; meeting.

===Taxation===

Corporations can only deduct net operating losses going back two years and forward 20 years.

===Reporting after incorporation===
Assuming a corporation has not sold stock to the public, conducting corporate business is straightforward. Often, it amounts to recording key corporate decisions (for example, borrowing money or buying real estate) and holding an annual meeting. These formalities can often be supplanted by written agreement and do not usually need a face-to-face meeting.

==Incorporation in the United Kingdom==

In the UK, the process of incorporation is generally called company formation. The United Kingdom is one of the quickest locations to incorporate, with a fully electronic process and a very fast turnaround by the national registrar of companies, the Companies House. The current Companies House record is five minutes to vet and issue a certificate of incorporation for an electronic application.

===Types of companies===
There are many different types of UK companies:

*Public limited company (PLC)
*Private company limited by shares (Ltd.)
*Company limited by guarantee
*Unlimited company (Unltd.)
*Limited liability partnership (LLP)
*Community interest company
*Industrial and provident society (IPS)
*Royal charter (RC)

==Europe==

* In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the GmbH (&quot;Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung&quot;, meaning &quot;limited liability business association&quot;), as well as the AG (&quot;Aktiengesellschaft&quot;, meaning &quot;business association with shares&quot;), are the entities most similar to the corporations in the US.
* In the United Kingdom, with the exception of an unlimited company or corporation which requires no designation as part of its legal company name, the titles Ltd. (limited company), CIC, CIO, or plc (public limited company) are used for corporations (or their Welsh equivalents in Wales).
* In France, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg, the term &quot;SARL (, company with limited liability)&quot; or SA (, anonymous corporation) or SAS (, simplified anonymous joint-stock corporation) is used.
* Spain, Portugal, Romania and Latin America use the title SA (anonymous partnership) for stock corporations or Ltda (limitada or limited liability) for limited companies. (Ltda is denoted SL in Spain, for &quot;Sociedad Limitada&quot;, and SRL in Argentina, for &quot;Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada&quot;).
* In Poland all types of companies are regulated by the Code of Commercial Companies. Companies in Poland are divided into two categories: corporations and partnerships; corporations provide liability limitation, while partnerships do not provide liability limitation or provide limitations just for selected partners. Two most popular forms of corporations are: SA (standing for Spółka Akcyjna - equivalent of joint stock company) and Sp. z o.o. (Spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością - equivalent of limited liability company). Amongst partnerships there are available: Spółka jawna (sp.j.) – a partnership where all the partners are fully liable); Spółka komandytowa (Sp. K.) – a partnership where at least one partner is fully liable and other one has limited liability; and Spółka komandytowo-akcyjna (Sp. K. A.) – a partnership where at least one partner is fully liable and other one is a stock shareholder not being liable.
* Denmark and Norway use the title A/S for stock corporations (, ), while Sweden uses the similar AB (). Finland uses Oy (), Oyj for stock corporations (Osakeyhtiö, julkinen) and Ay (Avoin yhtiö) or Ky (Kommandiittiyhtiö) for private enterprises.
* Italy uses &quot;Srl&quot; or &quot;Società a Responsabilità Limitata&quot; (limited liability company), and &quot;SpA&quot; or &quot;Società Per Azioni&quot; (stock corporation).
* Slovakia and the Czech Republic use s.r.o. (, meaning &quot;business with limited liability&quot;) and a.s. (, meaning &quot;business with shares&quot;).
* In Latvia, the most commonly used title of a corporation is &quot;S.I.A.&quot; () for &quot;limited liability company&quot;, or &quot;LLC&quot;, and &quot;A/S&quot; () for &quot;joint stock company&quot;, or &quot;JSC&quot;. The title &quot;S.I.A.&quot; and &quot;A/S&quot; are put before the name of the corporation. Lithuania uses &quot;UAB&quot; () for &quot;limited liability company&quot; and &quot;AB&quot; () for &quot;joint stock company&quot;, and, like in Latvia, they also appear before the corporation&#x27;s name.
* Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Slovenia uses: &quot;D.O.O.&quot; or &quot;Д.О.О.&quot; (in Cyrillic) (Serbian and Croatian: &quot;Društvo sa Ograničenom Odgovornošću / Друштво са Ограниченом Одговорношћу&quot;, Macedonian: &quot;Друштво со ограничена одговорност&quot;). The only difference is in Bulgaria, where it is reversed: &quot;ООД&quot; (OOD) (Bulgarian: &quot;Дружество с ограничена отговорност,&quot; Druzhestvo s ogranichena otgovornost&quot;).&quot; It also can be used for Ltd. (UK)
*Albania uses &quot;Sh.p.k&quot; () for &quot;limited liability company&quot;, &quot;Sh.a.&quot; (), meaning &quot;anonymous partnership&quot;, for stock corporations. Pursuant to the Albanian legislation, the possible business structures are:

: Sole proprietorship (person fizik) – A business owned and managed by one individual who is personally liable for all business debts and obligations.
: Limited liability company (LLC) – A hybrid legal structure that provides the limited liability features of a corporation and the tax efficiencies and operational flexibility of a partnership.
: Corporation – A legal entity owned by shareholders.
: Non-profit – An organization engaged in activities of public or private interest where making a profit is not a primary mission. Some non-profits are exempt from federal taxes.
* In the Netherlands, N.V. (&quot;Naamloze Vennootschap&quot;) and B.V. (&quot;Besloten Vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid&quot;) are used. In Belgium, the abbreviations NV and Bvba (or BV, resulting the new Belgian Code of Companies and Associations) are used for similar types of entity.

==Asia==

* In India, the term Pvt Ltd is used for a company that is private, an entity similar to an LLC in the United States. Ltd is used for publicly listed companies (shares of a listed company are traded on the stock market) or a public corporation, a similar entity to a corporation in the US.
* Indonesia uses PT (), meaning &quot;private limited&quot;, which is the equivalent of an incorporated entity in the US. This legal title is stated in front of the corporation name. If the shares become publicly listed for trading in stock exchange, it is called Tbk. (), appended after the corporation name.
* China uses WFOE (or WOFE), to refer to a Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise (WFOE). This is the most popular form of business entity for foreign investors wanting to set up a company in China; it is a limited liability company.
* Malaysia uses Sdn. Bhd. (), meaning &quot;private limited&quot;, which is the equivalent of an incorporated entity in the US.
* Singapore uses Pte. Ltd., meaning &quot;private limited&quot;, which is the equivalent of an incorporated entity in the US.
* Dubai uses &quot;LLC&quot; to denote a limited liability company. Listed companies use &quot;PJSC&quot; to denote a public joint stock company.
* In Turkey, there are two types of companies: Joint Stock Company (JSC) and Limited Liability Company (LLC). 100% foreign ownership of a JSC is legally permitted under the Turkish Law. A foreigner who has never been to Turkey can become a shareholder of a Turkish JSC by way of a power of attorney. Ltd. Şti. (which stands for &quot;Limited Şirketi&quot;) is a common form to denote limited liability companies.
* In the Philippines, it uses the terms, Corporation &amp; Incorporated (Inc.). similar entity to a corporation in the US.

==Canada==
In Canada, the process of incorporation can be done either at the federal or provincial level. Companies which incorporate with the federal government will generally need to register extra-provincially in the province that they elect to do business. Similarly, a provincial corporation may need to register extra-provincially if they are to have offices outside of their home province. Incorporated Canadian companies can generally use either Corp., Corporation, Inc., Incorporated, Incorporée, Limited, Limitée, Ltd., Ltée, Société par actions de régime fédéral, and S.A.R.F in their name, but this may vary from province to province. Note that there are two government structures operating within Canada. French system is prevalent in Quebec, while the English system is operating in 9 provinces/territories.

<doc id="414413" wikidata="Q1667982" url="?curid=414413" title="Internet Printing Protocol">
<text>The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is a specialized communication protocol used between client devices (computers, mobile phones, tablets, etc.) and printers (or print servers). The protocol allows clients to submit one or more print jobs to the network-attached printer or print server, and perform tasks such as querying the status of a printer, obtaining the status of print jobs, or cancelling individual print jobs.

Like all IP-based protocols, IPP can run locally or over the Internet. Unlike other printing protocols, IPP also supports access control, authentication, and encryption, making it a much more capable and secure printing mechanism than older ones.

IPP is the basis of several printer logo certification programs including AirPrint, IPP Everywhere, and Mopria Alliance, and is supported by over 98% of printers sold today.

== History ==

IPP began as a proposal by Novell for the creation of an Internet printing protocol project in 1996. The result was a draft written by Novell and Xerox called the Lightweight Document Printing Application (LDPA), derived from ECMA-140: Document Printing Application (DPA). At about the same time, IBM publicly proposed something called the HyperText Printing Protocol (HTPP), and both HP and Microsoft had started work on new print services for what became Windows 2000. Each of the companies chose to start a common Internet Printing Protocol project in the Printer Working Group (PWG) and negotiated an IPP birds-of-a-feather (or BOF) session with the Application Area Directors in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The BOF session in December 1996 showed sufficient interest in developing a printing protocol, leading to the creation of the IETF Internet Printing Protocol (ipp) working group, which concluded in 2005.

Work on IPP continues in the PWG Internet Printing Protocol workgroup with the publication of 23 candidate standards, 1 new and 3 updated IETF RFCs, and several registration and best practice documents providing extensions to IPP and support for different services including 3D Printing, scanning, facsimile, cloud-based services, and overall system and resource management.

IPP/1.0 was published as a series of experimental documents (RFC 2565, RFC 2566, RFC 2567, RFC 2568, RFC 2569, and RFC 2639) in 1999.

IPP/1.1 followed as a draft standard in 2000 with support documents in 2001, 2003, and 2015 (RFC 2910, RFC 2911, RFC 3196, RFC 3510 RFC 7472). IPP/1.1 was updated as a proposed standard in January 2017 (RFC 8010, RFC 8011,) and then adopted as Internet Standard 92 (STD 92,) in June 2018.

IPP 2.0 was published as a PWG Candidate Standard in 2009 (PWG 5100.10-2009,) and defined two new IPP versions (2.0 for printers and 2.1 for print servers) with additional conformance requirements beyond IPP 1.1. A subsequent Candidate Standard replaced it in 2011 defining an additional 2.2 version for production printers (PWG 5100.12-2011,). This specification was updated and approved as a full PWG Standard (PWG 5100.12-2015,) in 2015.

IPP Everywhere was published in 2013 and provides a common baseline for printers to support so-called &quot;driverless&quot; printing from client devices. It builds on IPP and specifies additional rules for interoperability, such as a list of document formats printers need to support. A corresponding self-certification manual and tool suite was published in 2016 allowing printer manufacturers and print server implementors to certify their solutions against the published specification and be listed on the IPP Everywhere printers page maintained by the PWG.

== Implementation ==
IPP is implemented using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and inherits all of the HTTP streaming and security features. For example, authorization can take place via HTTP&#x27;s Digest access authentication mechanism, GSSAPI, or any other HTTP authentication methods. Encryption is provided using the TLS protocol-layer, either in the traditional always-on mode used by HTTPS or using the HTTP Upgrade extension to HTTP (RFC 2817). Public key certificates can be used for authentication with TLS. Streaming is supported using HTTP chunking. The document to be printed is usually sent as a data stream. 

IPP accommodates various formats for documents to be printed. The PWG defined an image format called PWG Raster specifically for this purpose. Other formats include PDF or JPEG, depending on the capabilities of the destination printer.

IPP uses the traditional client–server model, with clients sending IPP request messages with the MIME media type &quot;application/ipp&quot; in HTTP POST requests to an IPP printer. IPP request messages consist of key–value pairs using a custom binary encoding followed by an &quot;end of attributes&quot; tag and any document data required for the request (such as the document to be printed). The IPP response is sent back to the client in the HTTP POST response, again using the &quot;application/ipp&quot; MIME media type.

Among other things, IPP allows a client to:

* query a printer&#x27;s capabilities (such as supported character sets, media types and document formats)
* submit print jobs to a printer
* query the status of a printer
* query the status of one or more print jobs
* cancel previously submitted jobs

IPP uses TCP with port 631 as its well-known port.

Products using the Internet Printing Protocol include Universal Print from Microsoft, CUPS (which is part of Apple macOS and many BSD and Linux distributions and is the reference implementation for most versions of IPP ), Novell iPrint, and Microsoft Windows versions starting from MS Windows 2000. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 offer IPP printing via HTTPS. Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 also support IPP printing over RPC in the &quot;Medium-Low&quot; security zone.

<doc id="414415" wikidata="Q953040" url="?curid=414415" title="Searchlight Pictures">
<text>Searchlight Pictures, Inc. is an American independent film production and distribution company, which since 2019 is owned by Walt Disney Studios, a sub-division of Disney Entertainment, a business segment of the Walt Disney Company. Founded in 1994 as Fox Searchlight Pictures for 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios), the studio focuses primarily on producing, distributing, and acquiring independent and specialty films.

Searchlight is known for distributing the films &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;, &quot;12 Years a Slave&quot;, &quot;Birdman&quot;, &quot;The Shape of Water&quot;, and &quot;Nomadland&quot;, all of which have won an Academy Award for Best Picture. The studio has grossed over $5.3 billion worldwide and amassed 51 Academy Awards, 30 Golden Globe Awards, and 56 BAFTA awards. &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; is the studio&#x27;s largest commercial success, with over $377 million (US) of box office receipts, against a production budget of only $15 million.

Searchlight Pictures was one of the 21st Century Fox film production units that was acquired by Disney in 2019. The studio&#x27;s current name was adopted in order to avoid confusion with Fox Corporation. Searchlight is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongside Walt Disney Pictures, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, and its larger sister unit 20th Century Studios. Compared to 20th Century, whose distribution operations have folded into Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, Searchlight retains its autonomous distribution unit.

== History ==
=== Before the creation of Searchlight Pictures ===

Prior to the creation of Searchlight Pictures, 20th Century Fox was active in the specialty film market, releasing independent and specialty films under the banner of 20th Century-Fox International Classics, later renamed 20th Century-Fox Specialized Film Division, then TLC Films. The most notable of the releases under these banners include &quot;Suspiria&quot;, &quot;Bill Cosby: Himself&quot;, &quot;Eating Raoul&quot;, &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot;, &quot;Reuben, Reuben&quot;, and &quot;Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot;.

In the early 1990s, 20th Century Fox executives decided to emulate the commercial success of Disney&#x27;s newly acquired Miramax studio. In 1994, 20th announced the formation of a subsidiary that would drive their entry into the specialty film market, and in July that year, they brought in Thomas Rothman, then president of production at The Samuel Goldwyn Company, to head up the new subsidiary. It was soon given the name &quot;Fox Searchlight Pictures&quot;, with Rothman as its founding president. The new company inherited the familiar branding elements associated with 20th Century Fox; Fox Searchlight films opened with a production logo consisting of the &quot;Fox Searchlight Pictures&quot; name presented as a large monolith, illuminated by the eponymous searchlights and accompanied by the 20th Century Fox fanfare composed by Alfred Newman.

=== First years and 21st Century Fox era ===
From its first release, &quot;The Brothers McMullen&quot; (1995), Fox Searchlight went to distribute a series of independent films such as &quot;Girl 6&quot;, &quot;Stealing Beauty&quot;, and &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot; (all 1996). While critically well received, these early releases were not commercially very successful; Fox Searchlight&#x27;s first real commercial breakthrough came with &quot;The Full Monty&quot; (1997), garnering the studio&#x27;s first awards.

In 2006, a companion label, Fox Atomic, was created to produce and/or distribute genre films. Fox Atomic closed down in 2009.

On June 28, 2012, Rupert Murdoch announced that Fox Searchlight&#x27;s owner News Corporation would be split into two publishing and media oriented companies: the second News Corporation, which takes on the publishing and Australian broadcasting assets, and 21st Century Fox, which operated Fox Searchlight parent Fox Entertainment Group. Murdoch states that the 21CF name was a way to maintain 20th Century Fox&#x27;s heritage.

Fox Stage Productions was formed in June 2013. The creation of 21st Century Fox was completed on June 28, 2013. In August 2013, 20CF started a theatrical joint venture with a trio of producers, both film and theater, Kevin McCollum, John Davis and Tom McGrath.

=== Disney era ===
On December 14, 2017, the Walt Disney Company agreed to acquire most assets from 21st Century Fox, including Fox Searchlight, for $52.4 billion. After a bid from Comcast (parent company of NBCUniversal) for $65 billion, Disney counterbid with $71.3 billion. On July 19, 2018, Comcast dropped out of the bid for 21st Century Fox in favor of Sky plc and Sky UK. Eight days later, Disney and 21CF shareholders approved the merger between the two companies. On March 12, 2019, Disney announced it has set to close the Fox deal on March 20. On March 19, 2019, 21CF spun off the remaining assets &quot;–&quot; the Fox Broadcasting Company, Fox Television Stations, the Fox News Group (which includes the Fox News Channel), and the domestic operations of Fox Sports &quot;–&quot; to the new Fox Corporation in preparation for the completion of the sale, which occurred the following day. The following day it was announced that Fox Searchlight Pictures would be situated under The Walt Disney Studios banner and several high profile layoffs occurred.

As of November 2019, FX Networks and Fox Searchlight were assigned to supply Hulu with content. On January 17, 2020, it was announced that the &quot;Fox&quot; name would be dropped from several of the Fox assets that were acquired by Disney, shortening the company&#x27;s name to &quot;Searchlight Pictures&quot;, in order to avoid brand confusion with Fox Corporation.

More recently, Nancy Utley has officially left Searchlight Pictures after six months, to launch Lake Ellyn Entertainment, and struck a first look deal with Chernin Entertainment. Disney elevated David Greenbaum and Matthew Greenfield, the then-current heads of production.

<text>Anne Meagher Northup (born January 22, 1948) is an American Republican politician and educator from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. From 1997 to 2007, she represented the Louisville-centered 3rd congressional district of Kentucky in the United States House of Representatives, where she served on the powerful House Appropriations Committee. She lost reelection to Democrat John Yarmuth in the 2006 election. She then ran for Governor of Kentucky, losing by 15 points to embattled governor Ernie Fletcher in the Republican primary election for the 2007 Kentucky gubernatorial election. Prior to her election to the United States House of Representatives, Northup had served in the Kentucky House of Representatives. Northup ran again for her old congressional seat in the 2008 election, losing again to Yarmuth.

==Early life and education==
Anne Meagher Northup was born on
January 22, 1948, in
Louisville, Kentucky to a large family of James and Floy Meagher, having nine sisters and a brother, and grew up in St. Matthews, a suburb of Louisville. Northup was educated at Sacred Heart Academy and Saint Mary&#x27;s College, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics and business.

==Early political career==
Northup first became active in politics as a volunteer for the Barry Goldwater 1964 presidential campaign. She was elected to the Kentucky General Assembly in 1987, where she represented the 32nd district until 1996.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Tenure===

She represented the Louisville-centered 3rd congressional district of Kentucky. Despite the Democratic leanings of the district, she won re-election four times. She served on the powerful House Appropriations Committee. 
She was one of the wealthiest members of the House of Representatives, ranking 34th out of the 435—with assets of $4.4 million to $15.9 million—based on financial disclosure statements made for the 2006 campaign.

===Elections===

====1996====
She was elected to the United States House in 1996, narrowly defeating one-term Democratic incumbent Mike Ward with a vote count of 126,625 to 125,326. The seat had been held for the previous 24 years by Democrat Ron Mazzoli.

====1998====
In 1998, Northup defeated Democratic candidate Chris Gorman, a former state attorney general, by just 4 percentage points.

In December 1998, she voted for three of the four impeachment charges against President Bill Clinton.

====2000====
In 2000, Northup faced state representative Eleanor Jordan, who was trying to become Kentucky&#x27;s first black member of Congress. As with many of Northup&#x27;s other opponents, Jordan, who had begun her political career as an unwed mother on welfare, argued that Northup too often sided with her Republican counterparts, voting the party line over 90% of the time. This would be a common theme for most of Northup&#x27;s Democratic challengers. Northup ran on her record of getting federal money for the district, and argued Jordan would be &quot;too liberal&quot; for constituents.

The competitive race—the candidates were in a dead heat in early polls—was of national interest in a year when Democrats were trying to regain control of the house. It attracted a visit from then-President Clinton in support of Jordan, and became at the time the second most expensive House race in Kentucky history. A memorable Northup ad featured a clip of Jordan speaking in the Kentucky House&#x27;s floor, urging colleagues to hurry up and vote a bill, saying &quot;I have a fund-raiser at 6 o&#x27;clock and I want to get out of here.&quot; The &quot;Courier-Journal&quot; credited that ad, combined with Jordan&#x27;s admission on a local radio program that she did not know the cost of a Medicare bill she had voted for, with Jordan&#x27;s gradual decline in support late in the campaign.

Although the race looked close early on, Northup pulled away to win with 53 percent of the vote to Jordan&#x27;s 44 percent, even as Al Gore carried the district. It would remain Northup&#x27;s biggest victory margin until 2004.

====2004====
Northup was elected to a fifth term with 60 percent of the vote in 2004, her largest margin of victory. Her earlier House races were much closer. She defeated long time Jefferson County Circuit Court Clerk Tony Miller. In three debates in October, she attacked her opponent as uninformed on national issues and unprepared for office. In polls before the debates, Northup led by 7 percentage points; in polls afterwards, she led by 24 points. She ran on her past performance, as well as the promise of securing funding for two new Ohio River bridges and a new Veteran&#x27;s Administration hospital.

Northup was endorsed by &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; (typically seen as liberal), several local Democratic officeholders, and former state Attorney General Chris Gorman, a Democrat who ran against her for the seat in 1998.

====2006====
Political observers had been amazed at Northup&#x27;s ability to hold onto the 3rd, even though it was easily the most Democratic district in Kentucky. However, she was defeated for re-election to a sixth term in the 2006 congressional election by John Yarmuth, former publisher and editorialist of the Louisville Eccentric Observer (LEO), an alternative newsweekly. Although initially considered an underdog for his lack of a political background and the potential for his views to be portrayed as strongly liberal, Yarmuth garnered 122,139 votes (51%) to Northup&#x27;s 116,157 votes (48%). Third-party candidates garnered 2,896 votes (1%).

The campaign was relatively civil, although ads were run calling Yarmuth a hypocrite for his statements condemning the minimum wage as immoral while his family&#x27;s restaurants paid some employees minimum wage. Northup also attempted to exploit Yarmuth&#x27;s lengthy record in print, repeating in campaign ads some of his potentially unpopular statements (such as allegedly supporting the legalization of marijuana) and holding a press conference to complain that not all of his old columns had been made available to her campaign. Major themes of Northup&#x27;s campaign was that she was independent of the then-unpopular President Bush, and that she was uniquely able to secure federal funds for Louisville projects. Due to her support for many of President Bush&#x27;s policies and her past campaigning with the president her reelection was closely watched on election night as an indicator as to how well the Democrats would do in the mid-term elections.

== Later career ==

===2007 gubernatorial campaign===
On January 17, 2007, Northup entered the Republican primary election for Governor of Kentucky. Northup&#x27;s running mate was State Representative Jeff Hoover of Jamestown, Kentucky, Republican leader in the Kentucky House. Northup received endorsements from prominent Kentucky Republicans including U.S. Senator Jim Bunning and Lt. Governor Steve Pence.

After a lengthy scandal and investigation during his first term involving alleged abuses of the state&#x27;s merit-based hiring system, many believed incumbent governor Ernie Fletcher, who sought re-election, no longer had sufficient support from either the Republican Party leadership or voters. It was released from &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; newspaper that Anne Northup was praised as a &quot;formidable&quot; candidate by the state&#x27;s top Republican leader, long-time U.S. Senator and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, although McConnell stopped short of an endorsement of any particular candidate. Northup faced Fletcher and businessman Billy Harper in the primary.

Northup began television advertisements about six weeks before the primary election, with the slogan &quot;The only Republican who can win in November&quot;. On May 22, 2007, Northup was defeated in the Republican primary by Fletcher. Fletcher lost in the general election to Democrat Steve Beshear.

===2008 congressional campaign===
On January 28, 2008, Northup announced she would run for her old congressional seat in the 2008 election. She had previously endorsed Louisville lawyer Erwin Roberts, who had planned to run, and helped raise money for him. However, Roberts withdrew from the race after learning he would likely be called to active duty in the U.S. Army Reserve. Northup defeated Bob DeVore Jr. and developer Chris Thieneman in the Republican primary.

At a press conference held in front of a gas station on June 17, 2008, Northup said that the 2008 elections were about the rising price of energy.

On November 4, 2008, Northup was defeated by incumbent Democrat John Yarmuth, 59% to 41%.

=== Consumer Product Safety Commission ===
On July 30, 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Northup to a seat on the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), and she was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on August 7. The seat was a Republican seat by statute and Northup was the choice of the Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. She was one of the few government regulators who had previously served in Congress. She left the Commission on October 26, 2012. Since her defeat in 2006, no other women have served in Congress from Kentucky.

== Personal life ==
She married Woody Northup, who attended nearby Notre Dame, and they have six children. One of her sisters is Mary T. Meagher, a former competition swimmer and four-time Olympic medalist.

<doc id="414418" wikidata="Q868171" url="?curid=414418" title="CUPS">
<text>CUPS (formerly an acronym for Common UNIX Printing System) is a modular printing system for Unix-like computer operating systems which allows a computer to act as a print server. A computer running CUPS is a host that can accept print jobs from client computers, process them, and send them to the appropriate printer.

CUPS consists of a print spooler and scheduler, a filter system that converts the print data to a format that the printer will understand, and a backend system that sends this data to the print device. CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) as the basis for managing print jobs and queues. It also provides the traditional command line interfaces for the System V and Berkeley print systems, and provides support for the Berkeley print system&#x27;s Line Printer Daemon protocol and limited support for the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. System administrators can configure the device drivers which CUPS supplies by editing text files in Adobe&#x27;s PostScript Printer Description (PPD) format. There are a number of user interfaces for different platforms that can configure CUPS, and it has a built-in web-based interface. CUPS is free software, provided under the Apache License.

== History ==
Michael Sweet, who owned Easy Software Products, started developing CUPS in 1997 and the first public betas appeared in 1999. The original design of CUPS used the Line Printer Daemon protocol (LPD), but due to limitations in LPD and vendor incompatibilities, the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) was chosen instead. CUPS was initially called &quot;The Common UNIX Printing System&quot;. This name was shortened to just &quot;CUPS&quot; beginning with CUPS 1.4 due to legal concerns with the UNIX trademark. CUPS was quickly adopted as the default printing system for most Linux distributions. In March 2002, Apple Inc. adopted CUPS as the printing system for Mac OS X 10.2. In February 2007, Apple Inc. hired chief developer Michael Sweet and purchased the CUPS source code. On December 20, 2019, Michael Sweet announced on his blog that he had left Apple. In 2020, the OpenPrinting organization forked the project, with Michael Sweet continuing work on it. Apple retained the builds for macOS, iOS, and iPadOS with latest release of Apple CUPS being version 2.3.6 on May 25, 2022. In 2024, a critical vulnerability involving remote code execution in CUPS was found impacting all GNU/Linux systems.

== Overview ==
CUPS provides a mechanism that allows print jobs to be sent to printers in a standard fashion. The print data goes to a &quot;scheduler&quot; which sends jobs to a &quot;filter system&quot; that converts the print job into a format the printer will understand. The filter system then passes the data on to a &quot;backend&quot;—a special filter that sends print data to a device or network connection. The system makes extensive use of PostScript and rasterization of data to convert the data into a format suitable for the destination printer.

CUPS offers a standard and modularised printing system that can process numerous data formats on the print server. Before CUPS, it was difficult to find a standard printer management system that would accommodate the very wide variety of printers on the market using their own printer languages and formats. For instance, the System V and Berkeley printing systems were largely incompatible with each other, and they required complicated scripts and workarounds to convert the program&#x27;s data format to a printable format. They often could not detect the file format that was being sent to the printer and thus could not automatically and correctly convert the data stream. Additionally, data conversion was performed on individual workstations rather than a central server.

CUPS allows printer manufacturers and printer-driver developers to create drivers more easily that work natively on the print server. Processing occurs on the server, allowing for easier network-based printing than with other Unix printing systems. With Samba installed, users can address printers on remote Windows computers, and generic PostScript drivers can be used for printing across the network.

=== Scheduler ===
The CUPS scheduler implements Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) over HTTP/1.1. A helper application (cups-lpd) converts Line Printer Daemon protocol (LPD) requests to IPP. The scheduler also provides a web-based interface for managing print jobs, the configuration of the server, and for documentation about CUPS itself.

An &quot;authorization&quot; module controls which IPP and HTTP messages can pass through the system. Once the IPP/HTTP packets are authorized they are sent to the &quot;client&quot; module, which listens for and processes incoming connections. The client module is also responsible for executing external CGI programs as needed to support web-based printers, classes, and job status monitoring and administration. Once this module has processed its requests, it sends them to the &quot;IPP&quot; module which performs Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) validation to prevent a client from sidestepping any access controls or authentication on the HTTP server. The URI is a text string that indicates a name or address that can be used to refer to an abstract or physical resource on a network.

The scheduler allows for classes of printers. Applications can send requests to groups of printers in a class, allowing the scheduler to direct the job to the first available printer in that class. A &quot;jobs&quot; module manages print jobs, sending them to the filter and backend processes for final conversion and printing, and monitoring the status messages from those processes.

The CUPS scheduler utilizes a &quot;configuration&quot; module, which parses configuration files, initializes CUPS data structures, and starts and stops the CUPS program. The configuration module will stop CUPS services during configuration file processing and then restart the service when processing is complete.

A &quot;logging&quot; module handles the logging of scheduler events for access, error, and page log files. The &quot;main&quot; module handles timeouts and dispatch of I/O requests for client connections, watching for signals, handling child process errors and exits, and reloading the server configuration files as needed.

Other modules used by the scheduler include:

* the &quot;MIME&quot; module, which handles a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) type and conversion database used in the filtering process that converts print data to a format suitable for a print device;
* a &quot;PPD&quot; module that handles a list of Postscript Printer Description (PPD) files;
* a &quot;devices&quot; module that manages a list of devices that are available in the system;
* a &quot;printers&quot; module that handles printers and PPDs within CUPS.

=== Filter system ===
CUPS can process a variety of data formats on the print server. It converts the print-job data into the final language/format of the printer via a series of &quot;filters&quot;. It uses MIME types for identifying file formats.

==== MIME databases ====
After the CUPS system has assigned the print job to the scheduler, it is passed to the CUPS filter system. This converts the data to a format suitable for the printer. During start-up, the CUPS daemon loads two MIME databases: codice_1 that defines the known file types that CUPS can accept data for, and codice_2 that defines the programs that process each particular MIME type.

The codice_1 file has the syntax:

codice_4

For example, to detect an HTML file, the following entry would be applicable:

codice_5
:codice_6

The second line matches the file contents to the specified MIME type by determining that the first kilobyte of text in the file holds printable characters and that those characters include HTML markup. If the pattern above matches, then the filter system would mark the file as the MIME type text/html.

The codice_2 file has the syntax:

codice_8

The &quot;source&quot; field designates the MIME type that is determined by looking up the codice_1 file, while the &quot;destination&quot; field lists the type of output requested and determines what program should be used. This is also retrieved from codice_1. The &quot;cost&quot; field assists in the selection of sets of filters when converting a file. The last field, &quot;program&quot;, determines which filter program to use to perform the data conversion.

Some examples:

 text/plain application/postscript 50 texttops
 application/vnd.cups-postscript application/vnd.cups-raster 50 pstoraster
 image/* application/vnd.cups-postscript 50 imagetops
 image/* application/vnd.cups-raster 50 imagetoraster

==== Filtering process ====
The filtering process works by taking input data pre-formatted with six arguments:

# the job ID of the print job
# the user name
# the job name
# the number of copies to print
# any print options
# the filename (though this is unnecessary if it has been redirected from standard input).

It then determines the type of data that is being input and the filter to be used through the use of the MIME databases; for instance, image data will be detected and processed through a particular filter, and HTML data detected and processed through another filter.

CUPS can convert supplied data either into PostScript data or directly into raster data. If it is converted into PostScript data an additional filter is applied called a &quot;prefilter&quot;, which runs the PostScript data through another PostScript converter so that it can add printer-specific options like selecting page ranges to print, setting &quot;n&quot;-up mode and other device-specific things. After the pre-filtering is done, the data can either be sent directly to a CUPS backend if using a PostScript printer, or it can be passed to another filter like Foomatic by linuxprinting.org. Alternatively, it can be passed to Ghostscript, which converts the PostScript into an intermediary &quot;CUPS-raster&quot; format. The intermediary raster format is then passed onto a final filter which converts the raster data to a printer-specific format. The default filters included with CUPS include:

* raster to PCL
* raster to ESC/P or ESC/P2 (an Epson printer language, now largely superseded by their new ESC/P-Raster format)
* raster to Dymo (another printer company).
* raster to Zebra Programming Language or ZPL (a Zebra Technologies printer language)

 other proprietary languages like GDI or SPL (Samsung Printer Language) are supported by Splix, a raster to SPL translator.

However, several other alternatives can integrate with CUPS. HPLIP (previously known as HP-IJS) provides Linux+CUPS drivers for HP printers, Gutenprint (previously known as Gimp-Print) is a range of high-quality printer drivers for (mostly) inkjet printers, and TurboPrint for Linux has another range of quality printer drivers for a wide range of printers.

=== Backends ===
The backends are the ways in which CUPS sends data to printers. There are several backends available for CUPS: parallel, serial, and USB ports, cups-pdf PDF Virtual Printing, as well as network backends that operate via the IPP, JetDirect (AppSocket), Line Printer Daemon (&quot;LPD&quot;), and SMB protocols.

A new codice_11 backend in CUPS 1.4 provides Bonjour (DNS-SD) based printer discovery. In CUPS 1.6, Bonjour printer discovery and sharing using Avahi is also supported.

== Compatibility ==
CUPS provides both the System V and Berkeley printing commands, so users can continue with traditional commands for printing via CUPS. CUPS uses port 631 (TCP and UDP), which is the standard IPP port, and optionally on port 515 by inetd, launchd, the Solaris Service Management Facility, or xinetd which use the cups-lpd helper program to support LPD printing. When CUPS is installed the codice_12 System V printing system command and the codice_13 Berkeley printing system commands are installed as compatible programs. This allows a standard interface to CUPS and allows maximum compatibility with existing applications that rely on these printing systems.

== User interface tools ==
Several tools exist to help set up CUPS.

=== CUPS web-based administration interface ===

On all platforms, CUPS has a web-based administration interface that runs on port 631. It particularly helps organisations that need to monitor print jobs and add print queues and printers remotely.

CUPS 1.0 provided a simple class, job, and printer-monitoring interface for web browsers.

CUPS 1.1 replaced this interface with an enhanced administration interface that allows users to add, modify, delete, configure, and control classes, jobs, and printers.

CUPS 1.2 and later provide a revamped web interface which features improved readability and design, support for automatically discovered printers, and better access to system logs and advanced settings.

=== GNOME ===
In GNOME starting from GNOME 3, CUPS printing has been handled in the Settings application, which is part of the GNOME Core Applications. The GUI can add CUPS printers and manage CUPS printers and queues. Before GNOME 3, the GNOME Print Settings (formerly called CUPS Manager) were used to perform these tasks.

GNOME&#x27;s widget toolkit GTK+ included integrated printing support based on CUPS in its version 2.10, released in 2006.

=== KDE ===
The KDEPrint framework for KDE contains various GUI tools that act as CUPS front ends and allows the administration of classes, print queues and print jobs; it includes a printer wizard to assist with adding new printers amongst other features. KDEPrint first appeared in KDE 2.2.

KDEPrint supports several different printing platforms, with CUPS one of the best supported. It replaced a previous version of printing support in KDE, &quot;qtcups&quot; and is backwards compatible with this module of KDE. &quot;kprinter&quot;, a dialogue-box program, serves as the main tool for sending jobs to the print device; it can also be started from the command line. KDEPrint includes a system to pre-filter any jobs before they are handed over to CUPS, or to handle jobs all on its own, such as converting files to PDF. These filters are described by a pair of Desktop/XML files.

KDEPrint&#x27;s main components include:

* a Print Dialog box, which allows printer properties to be modified
* a Print Manager, which allows management of printers, such as adding and removing printers, through an Add Printer Wizard
* a Job Viewer/Manager, which manages printer jobs, such as hold/release, cancel and move to another printer
* a CUPS configuration module (integrated into KDE)

=== Mac OS X ===
In Mac OS X 10.5, printers are configured in the Print &amp; Fax panel in System Preferences, and in printer proxy applications which display the print queues and allow additional configuration after printers are set up. Earlier versions of Mac OS X also included a Printer Setup Utility, which supplied configuration options missing from earlier versions of the Print &amp; Fax preference pane.

=== PrinterSetup ===
The PrinterSetup system can manage CUPS queues. It takes the approach of assigning a text file to describe each print queue. These &#x27;PrinterSetupFiles&#x27; may then be added to other text files called &#x27;PrinterSetupLists&#x27;. This allows logical grouping of printers. the PrinterSetup project remains in its infancy.

=== Red Hat Linux/Fedora ===
Starting with Red Hat Linux 9, Red Hat provided an integrated print manager based on CUPS and integrated into GNOME. This allowed adding printers via a user interface similar to the one Microsoft Windows uses, where a new printer could be added using an &quot;add new printer wizard&quot;, along with changing default printer properties in a window containing a list of installed printers. Jobs could also be started and stopped using a print manager, and the printer could be paused using a context menu that pops up when the printer icon is right-clicked.

Eric Raymond criticised this system in his piece &quot;The Luxury of Ignorance&quot;. Raymond had attempted to install CUPS using the Fedora Core 1 print manager but found it non-intuitive; he criticised the interface designers for not designing with the user&#x27;s point of view in mind. He found the idea of printer queues not obvious because users create queues on their local computer but these queues are actually created on the CUPS server.

He also found the plethora of queue-type options confusing as he could choose from between networked CUPS (IPP), networked Unix (LPD), networked Windows (SMB), networked Novell (NCP) or networked JetDirect. He found the help file singularly unhelpful and largely irrelevant to a user&#x27;s needs. Raymond used CUPS as a general topic to show that user-interface design on Linux desktops needs rethinking and more careful design. He stated:

The meta-problem here is that the configuration wizard does all the approved rituals (GUI with standardized clicky buttons, help popping up in a browser, etc. etc.) but doesn&#x27;t have the central attribute these are supposed to achieve: discoverability. That is, the quality that every point in the interface has prompts and actions attached to it from which you can learn what to do next. Does your project have this quality?

=== ESP Print Pro ===
Easy Software Products, the original creators of CUPS, created a GUI, provided support for many printers and implemented a PostScript RIP. ESP Print Pro ran on Windows, UNIX and Linux, but is no longer available and support for this product ended on December 31, 2007.

<text>Sir John Cowdery Kendrew, (24 March 1917 – 23 August 1997) was an English biochemist, crystallographer, and science administrator. Kendrew shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Max Perutz, for their work at the Cavendish Laboratory to investigate the structure of haem-containing proteins.

==Education and early life==
Kendrew was born in Oxford, son of Wilfrid George Kendrew, reader in climatology in the University of Oxford, and Evelyn May Graham Sandburg, art historian. After preparatory school at the Dragon School in Oxford, he was educated at Clifton College in Bristol, 1930–1936. He attended Trinity College, Cambridge in 1936, as a Major Scholar, graduating in chemistry in 1939. He spent the early months of World War II doing research on reaction kinetics, and then became a member of the Air Ministry Research Establishment, working on radar. In 1940 he became engaged in operational research at the Royal Air Force headquarters; commissioned a squadron leader on 17 September 1941, he was appointed an honorary wing commander on 8 June 1944, and relinquished his commission on 5 June 1945. He was awarded his PhD after the war in 1949.

==Research and career==
During the war years, he became increasingly interested in biochemical problems, and decided to work on the structure of proteins.

===Crystallography===
In 1945 he approached Max Perutz in the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. Joseph Barcroft, a respiratory physiologist, suggested he might make a comparative protein crystallographic study of adult and foetal sheep haemoglobin, and he started that work.

In 1947 he became a Fellow of Peterhouse; and the Medical Research Council (MRC) agreed to create a research unit for the study of the molecular structure of biological systems, under the direction of Sir Lawrence Bragg. In 1954 he became a Reader at the Davy-Faraday Laboratory of the Royal Institution in London.

===Crystal structure of myoglobin===

Kendrew shared the 1962 Nobel Prize for chemistry with Max Perutz for determining the first atomic structures of proteins using X-ray crystallography. Their work was done at what is now the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. Kendrew determined the structure of the protein myoglobin, which stores oxygen in muscle cells.

In 1947 the MRC agreed to make a research unit for the Study of the Molecular Structure of Biological Systems. The original studies were on the structure of sheep haemoglobin, but when this work had progressed as far as was possible using the resources then available, Kendrew embarked on the study of myoglobin, a molecule only a quarter the size of the haemoglobin molecule. His initial source of raw material was horse heart, but the crystals thus obtained were too small for X-ray analysis. Kendrew realized that the oxygen-conserving tissue of diving mammals could offer a better prospect, and a chance encounter led to his acquiring a large chunk of whale meat from Peru. Whale myoglobin did give large crystals with clean X-ray diffraction patterns. However, the problem still remained insurmountable, until in 1953 Max Perutz discovered that the phase problem in analysis of the diffraction patterns could be solved by multiple isomorphous replacement — comparison of patterns from several crystals; one from the native protein, and others that had been soaked in solutions of heavy metals and had metal ions introduced in different well-defined positions. An electron density map at 6 angstrom (0.6 nanometre) resolution was obtained by 1957, and by 1959 an atomic model could be built at 2 angstrom (0.2 nm) resolution.

===Later career===
In 1963, Kendrew became one of the founders of the European Molecular Biology Organization; he also founded the &quot;Journal of Molecular Biology&quot; and was for many years its editor-in-chief. He became Fellow of the American Society of Biological Chemists in 1967 and honorary member of the International Academy of Science, Munich. In 1974, he succeeded in persuading governments to establish the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg and became its first director. He was knighted in 1974. From 1974 to 1979, he was a Trustee of the British Museum, and from 1974 to 1988 he was successively Secretary General, Vice-President, and President of the International Council of Scientific Unions.

After his retirement from EMBL, Kendrew became President of St John&#x27;s College at the University of Oxford, a post he held from 1981 to 1987. In his will, he designated his bequest to St John&#x27;s College for studentships in science and in music, for students from developing countries. The &quot;Kendrew Quadrangle&quot; at St John&#x27;s College in Oxford, officially opened on 16 October 2010, is named after him.

Kendrew was married to the former Elizabeth Jarvie (née Gorvin) from 1948 to 1956. Their marriage ended in divorce. Kendrew was subsequently partners with the artist Ruth Harris. He had no surviving children.

A biography of Kendrew, entitled &quot;A Place in History: The Biography of John C. Kendrew&quot;, by Paul M. Wassarman was published by Oxford University Press in 2020.

<text>Nelson Smock Riddle Jr. (June 1, 1921 – October 6, 1985) was an American arranger, composer, bandleader and orchestrator whose career stretched from the late 1940s to the mid-1980s. He worked with many vocalists at Capitol Records, including Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole, Judy Garland, Dean Martin, Peggy Lee, Johnny Mathis, Rosemary Clooney and Keely Smith. He scored and arranged music for many films and television shows, earning an Academy Award and three Grammy Awards. He found commercial and critical success with a new generation in the 1980s, in a trio of Platinum albums with Linda Ronstadt.

==Early years==
Riddle was born in Oradell, New Jersey, the only surviving child of Marie Albertine Riddle (a native of Mulhouse, France, whose father was Spanish) and Nelson Smock Riddle, who was of English-Irish and Dutch descent. His mother had suffered six miscarriages and one stillbirth in her lifetime. It was his mother&#x27;s second marriage. The family later moved to nearby Ridgewood. 

Following his father&#x27;s interest in music, he began taking piano lessons at age eight and trombone lessons at age fourteen. He was encouraged to continue his musical pursuits at Ridgewood High School.

A formative experience was hearing Serge Koussevitsky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra playing Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot;. Riddle said later: &quot;... I&#x27;ve never forgotten it. It&#x27;s almost as if the orchestra leaped from the stage and smacked you in the face ...&quot;

By his teenage years, Riddle had decided to become a professional musician; &quot;... I wanted to be a jazz trombone player, but I didn&#x27;t have the coordination.&quot; So he began to turn to composing and arranging.

The Riddle family had a summer house in Rumson, New Jersey. Riddle enjoyed Rumson so much that he convinced his parents to allow him to attend his senior year in high school there (1938).

In Rumson while playing for trumpeter Charlie Briggs&#x27; band, the Briggadiers, he met one of the most important influences on his later arranging style: Bill Finegan, with whom he began arranging lessons. Despite being only four years older than Riddle, Finegan was considerably more musically sophisticated, and within a few years Riddle was creating not only some of the most popular arrangements from the swing era, such as Glenn Miller&#x27;s &quot;Little Brown Jug&quot;, but also great jazz arrangements such as Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s &quot;Chloe&quot; and &quot;At Sundown&quot; from the mid-1940s.

After his graduation from Rumson High School, Riddle spent his late teens and early twenties playing trombone in and occasionally arranging for various local dance bands, culminating in his association with the Charlie Spivak Orchestra. In 1943, Riddle joined the Merchant Marine, serving at Sheepshead Bay, New York for about two years while continuing to work for the Charlie Spivak Orchestra.

Riddle studied orchestration under his fellow merchant mariner, composer Alan Shulman. After his enlistment term ended, Riddle traveled to Chicago to join Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s orchestra in 1944, where he remained the orchestra&#x27;s third trombone for eleven months until drafted by the Army in April 1945, shortly before the end of World War II. He was discharged in June 1946, after fifteen months of active duty. He moved shortly thereafter to Hollywood to pursue a career as an arranger, and spent the next several years writing arrangements for multiple radio and record projects. In May 1949, Doris Day had a #2 hit, &quot;Again&quot;, backed by Riddle.

==Capitol years==
In 1950, Riddle was hired by composer Les Baxter to write arrangements for a recording session with Nat King Cole; this was one of Riddle&#x27;s first associations with Capitol Records. Although one of the songs Riddle had arranged, &quot;Mona Lisa,&quot; soon became the biggest selling single of Cole&#x27;s career, the work was credited to Baxter. However, once Cole learned the identity of the arrangement&#x27;s creator, he sought out Riddle&#x27;s work for other sessions, and thus began a fruitful partnership that furthered the careers of both men at Capitol.

During the same year, Riddle also formed a friendship with Vern Yocum (born George Vernon Yocum), a big band jazz musician (and brother of Pied Piper Clark Yocum) who would transition into music preparation for Frank Sinatra and other entertainers at Capitol Records. A collaboration followed, with Vern becoming Riddle&#x27;s &quot;right hand&quot; as copyist and librarian for the next thirty years.

In 1953, Capitol Records executives viewed the up-and-coming Riddle as a prime choice to arrange for Frank Sinatra. Sinatra was reluctant however, preferring instead to remain with Axel Stordahl, his long-time collaborator from his Columbia Records years. When success of the first few Capitol sides with Stordahl proved disappointing, Sinatra eventually relented and Riddle was called in to arrange his first session for Sinatra, held on April 30, 1953. Riddle drew on Sinatra&#x27;s rhythm section, led by drummer/percussionist Irving Cottler (who was the featured drummer on Nat King Cole&#x27;s &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;). The first product of the Riddle–Sinatra partnership, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got the World on a String,&quot; became a runaway hit and is often credited with relaunching the singer&#x27;s slumping career. Riddle&#x27;s personal favorite was a Sinatra ballad album, one of his most successful recordings, &quot;Only the Lonely&quot;.

For the next decade, Riddle continued to arrange for Sinatra and Cole, in addition to such Capitol artists as Kate Smith, Judy Garland, Dean Martin, Keely Smith, Sue Raney and Ed Townsend. He also found time to record his own instrumental discs, released on Capitol in both 45 RPM single, and LP album format. Riddle&#x27;s most successful tune was &quot;Lisbon Antigua&quot;, released in November 1955, which reached and remained at the #1 position for four weeks in 1956. Riddle&#x27;s most notable LPs were &quot;Hey ... Let Yourself Go&quot; (1957) and &quot;C&#x27;mon ... Get Happy&quot; (1958), both of which peaked at a respectable number twenty on the Billboard charts. In 1959, he won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Composition First Recorded and Released in 1958 (over 5 minutes&#x27; duration) at the inaugural award ceremony for &quot;Cross Country Suite&quot;, which was composed for former bandmate Buddy DeFranco.

While at Capitol, Riddle continued his successful career arranging music for film, most notably with MGM&#x27;s Conrad Salinger on the first onscreen duet between Bing Crosby and Sinatra in &quot;High Society&quot; (1956), and the 1957 film version of &quot;Pal Joey&quot; directed by George Sidney for Columbia Pictures.

==Later years==

In 1957, Riddle and his orchestra were featured on &quot;The Rosemary Clooney Show&quot;, a 30-minute syndicated program.

In 1962, Riddle orchestrated two albums for Ella Fitzgerald, &quot;Ella Swings Brightly with Nelson&quot; and &quot;Ella Swings Gently with Nelson&quot;, their first work together since 1959&#x27;s &quot;Ella Fitzgerald Sings the George and Ira Gershwin Song Book&quot;. The mid-1960s would also see Fitzgerald and Riddle collaborate on the last of Ella&#x27;s &quot;Songbook&quot;s, devoted to the songs of Jerome Kern (&quot;Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Jerome Kern Song Book&quot;) and Johnny Mercer (&quot;Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Johnny Mercer Song Book&quot;).

In 1963, Riddle joined Sinatra&#x27;s newly established label Reprise Records, under the musical direction of Morris Stoloff.

In 1964, Riddle partnered with Tom Jobim, who is considered to be one of the great exponents of Brazilian music and one of the main founders of the bossa nova movement. The record, titled &quot;The Wonderful World of Antônio Carlos Jobim&quot;, was released in 1965.

In 1966, Riddle was hired by television producer William Dozier to create the music for the &quot;Batman&quot; television series starring Adam West. (Neal Hefti had written the &quot;Batman&quot; theme song and was originally hired for the series, but became unavailable.) Riddle did the first two seasons of &quot;Batman&quot; (sans two episodes scored by Warren Barker), along with the theatrically released &quot;Batman: The Movie&quot;. Billy May did the third season&#x27;s music. Re-recordings of Riddle&#x27;s music from &quot;Batman&quot; were issued on one soundtrack LP and a 45 RPM single. There was a &quot;Batmanesque&quot; tone in the soundtrack for Howard Hawks&#x27; John Wayne film &quot;El Dorado&quot;, also scored by Riddle in 1966, due to his continued heavy use of brass.

Riddle was the musical director for 16 episodes of &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; between 1967 and 1969.

Riddle&#x27;s television work in the 1960s included his hit theme song and incidental music for &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot; and &quot;The Rogues&quot;. His film work in the 1960s included the scores for the Rat Pack motion pictures &quot;Robin and the 7 Hoods&quot; and the original &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot;. In 1969, he arranged and conducted the music to the film &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot;, which starred a trio of non-singers, Lee Marvin, Clint Eastwood and Jean Seberg.

In the latter half of the 1960s, the partnership between Riddle and Frank Sinatra grew more distant as Sinatra began increasingly to turn to Don Costa, Billy May and an assortment of other arrangers for his album projects. Although Riddle would write various arrangements for Sinatra until the late 1970s, &quot;Strangers In The Night&quot;, released in 1966, was the last full album project the pair completed together. The collection of Riddle-arranged songs was intended to expand on the success of the title track, which had been a number one hit single for Sinatra arranged by Ernie Freeman.

&quot;Nelson Riddle Conducts The 101 Strings&quot; was recorded in London in 1970. Riddle had been without a recording contract for the first time in more than 25 years. It had been two years since his Liberty Records contract ended. That year, he flew to London and recorded an album with the 101 Strings Orchestra. Produced by Jack Dorsey, it was released on Marble Arch Records. Biographer Peter J. Levinson offered a sober assessment of the project, arguing that Riddle was &quot;out of his depth&quot; with the fusion of contemporary and classical instrumentation. The album went through several re-issues on the Alshire label (including &quot;Nelson Riddle Arranges and Conducts 101 Strings&quot; (1970); &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; (1971); and &quot;Swingin&#x27; Songs&quot; (1972), minus &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;) and the Vogue Records label.

During the 1970s, Riddle&#x27;s film and television efforts included the nostalgic adaptation score for the 1974 version of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, which earned him his first Academy Award, after some five nominations. In 1973, he served as musical director for the Emmy Award-winning &quot;The Julie Andrews Hour&quot;. He wrote the theme songs for the 1972 television series &quot;Emergency!&quot; and the 1975 television series &quot;Caribe&quot;, and scored the 1977 miniseries &quot;Seventh Avenue&quot;. The Nelson Riddle Orchestra also made numerous concert appearances throughout the 1970s, some of which were led and contracted by his good friend, Tommy Shepard.

On March 14, 1977, Riddle conducted his last three arrangements for Sinatra. &quot;Linda&quot;, &quot;Sweet Lorraine&quot; and &quot;Barbara&quot;, were intended for an album of songs with women&#x27;s names. The album was never completed. &quot;Sweet Lorraine&quot; was released in 1990 and the other two were included in &quot;The Complete Reprise Studio Recordings&quot;, released in 1995.

In 1978 Riddle was Musical Director for the 50th Academy Awards ceremony, the only occasion on which he performed the task.

In December 1979, Riddle conducted and arranged &quot;Something&quot; for Sinatra&#x27;s 1980 album &quot;Trilogy&quot;. And in 1981, he also arranged and conducted the medley of &quot;The Gal That Got Away&quot; and &quot;It Never Entered My Mind&quot; for Sinatra&#x27;s album &quot;She Shot Me Down&quot;, which was the final time he worked for Frank.

1982 saw Riddle work for the last time with Ella Fitzgerald, on her last orchestral Pablo album, &quot;The Best Is Yet to Come&quot;.

Riddle had composed most of the incidental music for &quot;Newhart&quot;, and the show&#x27;s 71st episode was dedicated to his memory.

==Career revival==
In the spring of 1982, Riddle was approached by Linda Ronstadt—via telephone through her manager and producer, Peter Asher—to write arrangements for an album of jazz standards that Ronstadt had been contemplating since her stint in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;. The agreement between the two resulted in a three-album contract which included what were to be the last arrangements of Riddle&#x27;s career, with the exception of an album of twelve Great American Songbook standards he arranged and conducted for his old friend, opera singer Kiri Te Kanawa, in April 1985, six months before his death that October. Ronstadt recalls that when she initially approached Riddle, she did not know if he was even familiar with her music. He knew her name, but basically hated rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. However, his daughter was a big Linda Ronstadt fan and told her father, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, Dad. Her checks won&#x27;t bounce.&quot;

When Riddle learned of Ronstadt&#x27;s desire to learn more about traditional pop music and agreed to record with her, he insisted on a complete album or nothing. He explained to Ronstadt that he had once turned down Paul McCartney, who had sought him out to write an arrangement for one of McCartney&#x27;s albums, &quot;I just couldn&#x27;t do it. You can&#x27;t put something like that in the middle of a bunch of other things. The mood comes and then it changes. It&#x27;s like putting a picture in a bad frame.&quot; Riddle was at first skeptical of Ronstadt&#x27;s proposed project, but once he agreed, his career turned around immediately. For her to do &quot;elevator music&quot;, as she called it, was a great surprise to the young audience. Joe Smith, the president of Elektra, was terrified that the albums would turn off the rock audience. The three albums together sold over seven million copies and brought Riddle back to a young audience during the last three years of his life. Arrangements for Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s New&quot; (1983) and &quot;Lush Life&quot; (1984) won Riddle his second and third Grammy Awards.

On January 19, 1985, Riddle conducted at the nationally televised 50th Presidential Inaugural Gala, the day before the second inauguration of Ronald Reagan. The program was hosted by Frank Sinatra, who sang &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot; and &quot;One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)&quot; (backed by a solo dance routine by Mikhail Baryshnikov).

Working with Ronstadt, Riddle brought his career back into focus in the last three years of his life. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;What&#x27;s New&quot; &quot;isn&#x27;t the first album by a rock singer to pay tribute to the golden age of pop, but is ... the best and most serious attempt to rehabilitate an idea of pop that Beatlemania and the mass marketing of rock LPs for teen-agers undid in the mid-60s ... In the decade prior to Beatlemania, most of the great band singers and crooners of the 40s and 50s codified a half-century of American pop standards on dozens of albums ... many of them now long out-of-print.&quot; &quot;What&#x27;s New&quot; is the first album by a rock singer to have major commercial success in rehabilitating the Great American Songbook.

Riddle&#x27;s third and final Grammy was awarded posthumously—and accepted on his behalf by Linda Ronstadt just prior to airtime—in early 1986. Ronstadt subsequently presented the evening&#x27;s first on-air award, at which time she narrated a tribute to the departed maestro.

==Personal life==
Riddle married his first wife, Doreen Moran, on October 10, 1945, while in the Army. The couple had seven children: Nelson Riddle III, Maureen Alicia Riddle, Christopher Riddle, Rosemary Riddle, Leonora Celeste Riddle (1957–1958), Cecily Jean Riddle, and Bettina Riddle.

Riddle had an extramarital affair with singer Rosemary Clooney in the 1960s, which contributed to the breakup of their respective marriages. In 1968, Riddle separated from his wife Doreen; their divorce became official in 1970. A few months later he married Naomi Tenenholtz, who was then his secretary, with whom he would remain for the rest of his life. Riddle&#x27;s eldest son Nelson III resides in London, England, and is married to British actress Paula Wilcox. Riddle&#x27;s eldest daughter, Rosemary, is the trustee of the Nelson Riddle Trust.

Riddle was a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the national fraternity for men in music.

In a 1982 radio interview on WNEW with Jonathan Schwartz, Riddle cited Stan Kenton&#x27;s &quot;23°N — 82°W&quot; arranged by Bill Russo as inspiration for his signature trombone interplay crescendos.

In 1985, Riddle died in Los Angeles, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, at age 64 of cardiac and kidney failure as a result of cirrhosis, with which he had been diagnosed five years earlier. His cremated remains are inurned at Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, California in the Hall of David Mausoleum.

==Legacy==
Following Riddle&#x27;s death, his last three arrangements for Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s &quot;For Sentimental Reasons&quot; album were conducted by Terry Woodson; the album was released in 1986. In February 1986, Riddle&#x27;s youngest son Christopher, himself an accomplished bass trombonist, assumed the leadership of his father&#x27;s orchestra. 

Following the death of Riddle&#x27;s second wife Naomi in 1998, proceeds from the sale of the Riddle home in Bel Air were used to establish a Nelson Riddle Endowed Chair and library at the University of Arizona, which officially opened in 2001. The opening showcased a gala concert of Riddle&#x27;s works, with Ronstadt as a featured guest performer. 

In 2000, Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops released a Nelson Riddle tribute album on Telarc Records titled &quot;Route 66: That Nelson Riddle Sound&quot;. The album showcased expanded orchestral adaptations of the original arrangements provided by the Nelson Riddle Archives, and was presented in a state-of-the-art digital recording that was among the first titles to be released on multi-channel SACD.

<doc id="414426" wikidata="Q3409441" url="?curid=414426" title="Richard Bacon (politician)">
<text>Richard Michael Bacon (born 3 December 1962) is a British politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for South Norfolk from 2001 until 2024. He is a member of the Conservative Party.

==Early life==
Bacon was educated at The King&#x27;s School, Worcester and then studied at the London School of Economics and Political Science, gaining a first in Politics and Economics. He was also executive editor of the student newspaper, &quot;The Beaver&quot;.

He worked variously in investment banking, financial journalism and public relations consultancy, before setting up his own business advising blue chip international companies on communications.

==Parliamentary career==
Bacon joined the Conservative Party in 1978. In 1997, he unsuccessfully contested the South-London constituency of Vauxhall, against the Labour incumbent, Kate Hoey. He finished in third place with 15.2% of the overall vote.

Bacon was then selected for the very safe Conservative seat of South Norfolk on the retirement of its veteran MP and former Cabinet Minister, John MacGregor. He won the seat at the 2001 general election, and was returned again at the 2005 general election with an increased majority. In the 2011 district council elections his constituency lost a single Conservative seat to the Liberal Democrats resulting in a majority of 30 seats. In the 2015 general election, Bacon increased his majority for a third time, to double that of his 2001 winning margin.

Bacon is a former member of the Public Accounts Committee as of 2017.

Though he rarely rebelled against the party line, he consistently rebelled in votes on military action in the Middle East. In March 2003 he was one of only 15 Conservative MPs to vote against the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He stated at the time that &quot;I do not believe war is always wrong. If I had, I would not have served in the Territorial Army&quot;.

Following the Commons debate on Britain&#x27;s response to the Syrian civil war on 29 August 2013, Bacon voted against his own party on a motion approving the use of military force &quot;if necessary&quot; (one of 30 Conservatives to do so), saying he was &quot;voting against the principle of military action&quot;.

In the Commons debate on intervention against ISIS in Iraq held on 26 September 2014, Bacon again voted against his own party, becoming one of only six Conservatives to defy the three-line whip imposed on Conservative MPs. Prior to the vote he said: &quot;After bombing the Middle East for much of the past twenty five years, we should have realised by now that we are making things worse&quot;.

In May 2009, Bacon was one of 15 MPs to sign a Motion of No Confidence in the House of Commons speaker Michael Martin.

He voted against anti-terror laws, top-up fees, foundation hospitals, and the ban on fox hunting, and was one of the few Conservatives to support the Impeach Blair campaign. He was also sceptical about aspects of the climate change debate, having opposed plans to build new wind turbines in South Norfolk, stating the scheme was not viable for the area.

In February 2007, Bacon was alleged to be the politician with the highest expenditure on taxi and car hire during the previous year, a claim which he disputed and referred to the National Audit Office.

Bacon was in favour of Brexit prior to the 2016 referendum.

In May 2023, Bacon announced he would stand down at the 2024 general election.

===Deporting foreign prisoners===
In April 2006, Bacon&#x27;s questioning of Home Office officials concerning the fate of failed asylum seekers released from prison led to a major embarrassment for the Labour administration in the run-up to the local elections the following month, and the dismissal of Charles Clarke, the home secretary. Bacon was not actually himself in favour of the sacking of Clarke, a fellow Norfolk MP, declaring that he had always liked him, and that his questioning had been &quot;business, not pleasure&quot;.

In July 2006, Bacon was named &quot;Backbencher of the Year&quot; by his fellow MPs for the result of his efforts, and in November 2006, he won three more awards: &quot;Parliamentarian of the Year&quot; from &quot;The Spectator&quot; magazine, &quot;Politician of the Year&quot; from the Political Studies Association and &quot;Outstanding Parliamentarian of the Year&quot; from the ConservativeHome website.

===Constituency dissatisfaction===
Bacon was deselected by his local party committee after coming under fire from constituents who complained that he was guilty of repeatedly failing to respond to emails and other forms of correspondence. They also complained that he was virtually anonymous in his South Norfolk constituency. This eventually led to posters being put up throughout South Norfolk asking &#x27;Where is Richard? Has anyone seen our MP?&#x27; The view being that Mr Bacon was not doing his job of representing his constituents.

===&quot;Conundrum&quot;===
Bacon is co-author, along with Christopher Hope, senior political correspondent of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, of &quot;Conundrum: Why every government gets things wrong and what we can do about it&quot; (2013), an analysis of the failure of high-profile UK public sector projects, including the National Health Service IT programme and the Child Support Agency, Passport Agency, Tax Credit scheme, Rural Payments Agency and Student Loans Company. They argue that a key reason for the repeated failure of such projects is that civil servants – charged with turning the grand vision of ministers into reality – &quot;have been recruited on the basis of their cognitive abilities in terms of playing with ideas, not for their ability to make things happen&quot;.

Bacon was married to Victoria Panton in 2006 at St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Westminster, and has two children. The couple divorced in 2019.

<text>Adrian Edward Bailey (born 11 December 1945) is a retired British Labour and Co-operative politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for West Bromwich West from 2000, when he won the seat at a by-election in November 2000 until he stood down at the general election in 2019. He was the Chairman of the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee 2010–2015.

==Early life==

Born in Salisbury, Bailey was educated at Cheltenham Grammar School before going on to university at the University of Exeter, graduating in 1967 with an Honours Degree in Economic History. Subsequently, he trained at the Loughborough College of Librarianship and graduated in 1971 with a postgraduate diploma in Librarianship. From 1971–1982 he was employed as a professional librarian by Cheshire County Council and from 1973 to 1982 he also worked as a librarian and teacher of study skills in a Cheshire Comprehensive school.

==Political career==

Bailey contested the seat of South Worcestershire at the 1970 general election, where he was easily defeated by Gerald Nabarro. At both the February 1974 general election and October 1974 general election he unsuccessfully contested the Cheshire seat of Nantwich, where he was defeated by John Cockcroft.

In 1976, the Speaker of the House of Commons, Selwyn Lloyd decided to stand down from the Commons, and Bailey contested the resulting by-election. However, he was again easily defeated, this time by David Hunt, who was later to enter the Cabinet of John Major. Bailey was not to fight a Parliamentary election again for 24 years, but contested and lost the Cheshire West European seat in 1979.

In 1982, Bailey moved to the West Midlands to become a full-time political organiser for the Co-operative Party covering the Midlands and South Yorkshire region. He held this post until his election to Parliament in 2000.

He was elected as a councillor for Sandwell Borough Council in 1991 and was its Deputy Leader from 1997 to 2000. At the time of the resignation of Commons Speaker, Betty Boothroyd in 2000, Bailey was the Secretary of the constituency Labour Party and Deputy Leader of the local council and seemed the obvious choice to fight what was then a safe Labour seat in the impending by-election. He was chosen to fight the seat and won fairly comfortably on 23 November 2000, entering the Commons 30 years after his first attempt. He is unusual in that he has contested two Parliamentary by-elections caused by the resignation of two different Speakers of the House of Commons.

Following its establishment in 2002, Bailey took the position of Secretary of The All Party Parliamentary Group for Steel which acts as a group to promote the interests of the steel manufacturing industry and the communities that work in that industry.

Following the 2005 general election, Bailey became a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and served successive Secretaries of State, David Blunkett and John Hutton. He also served as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Bob Ainsworth, the Minister of State at the Ministry of Defence.

He supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election.

He retired at the 2019 United Kingdom general election.

==Personal life==

In 1989 Bailey married Jill, a schoolteacher.

<text>Dame Vera Baird (&#x27;Thomas; born 13 February 1950) is a British barrister and politician who has held roles as a government minister, police and crime commissioner, and Victims&#x27; Commissioner for England and Wales.

A Labour Party Member of Parliament for Redcar from 2001 to 2010, Baird was a government minister from 2006 to 2010 and the Solicitor General for England and Wales from 2007 to 2010. She served as the Police and Crime Commissioner for Northumbria Police from November 2012 to June 2019. She was appointed as Victim&#x27;s Commissioner in June 2019 and resigned in September 2022, accusing government ministers of downgrading victims&#x27; interests.

Baird was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to women and equality.

== Education ==

Baird attended Yew Tree County Primary School and the local authority-run Chadderton Grammar School for Girls. She then studied law at Newcastle Polytechnic where she gained an LLB. While at Newcastle Polytechnic she founded and edited a student newspaper, &#x27;Polygon&#x27;, and a year later was elected vice president of the Polytechnic Union.
In 1983 she gained a BA in literature and modern history at the Open University. In 1983 she became a legal associate of the Royal Town Planning Institute. She completed the first year of an MA in modern history at London Guildhall University from 1999 before transferring to the University of Teesside on being selected for Redcar. She is currently studying for an MPhil (History) at the University of Teesside.

She is an honorary fellow of St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford and of Teesside University and an honorary professor of London South Bank University. In November 2017 Baird was appointed an Honorary Fellow of Durham University Law School.

==Legal career==

Baird was called to the Bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1975 and first practised in the North East, setting up Collingwood Chambers in Newcastle upon Tyne, with other young barristers, shortly after she finished her pupilage and becoming its Head of Chambers for some years.

In 1983 she was retained to act for Billingham Against Nuclear Dumping (BAND) when the then nuclear waste disposal agency NIREX planned to store intermediate-level nuclear waste in a disused anhydrite mine under Billingham, though the plans were abandoned in 1985 when the owners of the mine, ICI, refused to co-operate. At the conclusion of the campaign her fees were, at her direction, donated by BAND to the Druridge Bay Campaign. She subsequently represented similar groups opposed to nuclear-waste dumping threatened at Fulbeck in Lincolnshire (Lincolnshire Against Nuclear Dumping- LAND), at North Killingholme on Humberside (HAND) and at Bradwell (BAND) in a lengthy High Court action in 1986 before the plans were abandoned by the Conservative government shortly before the 1987 general election.

Baird represented a dismissed mother-to-be in an early pregnancy discrimination case (&quot;Brown v Stockton on Tees Borough Council&quot;) in the House of Lords. In the late 1980s she represented a mother who was alleged to have killed her three sons, an early example of a parent allegedly suffering from Münchausen syndrome by proxy. She acted for many political protesters, at Greenham Common and other peace camps and on anti-Apartheid marches and demonstrations, and defended women who damaged shops in protest against &#x27;top-shelf&#x27; magazines. She represented local objectors in compulsory purchase and planning inquiries.

During the 1984–85 miners&#x27; strike she represented striking miners, most notably in North East England, charged with offences arising from picketing, demonstrations and the alleged intimidation of miners seeking to break the strike. On Saturdays during the strike Baird was regularly seen outside a supermarket in Jesmond with a wheelbarrow collecting food for miners&#x27; families.

Baird met the 6th Lord Gifford while working on the Orgreave trial where her questioning of the police proved crucial to the outcome. The Orgreave trial concerned allegations of riot and violent disorder against 95 miners, 15 of whom were in the first trial, which was abandoned by the prosecution after 16 weeks. She joined Gifford&#x27;s chambers before moving to the Chambers of Michael Mansfield QC in 1988.

As a member of Mansfield&#x27;s Chambers Baird was involved in many high-profile cases at the bar. She defended in murder cases, robberies, drug cases, fraud and bribery cases at the Old Bailey and on appeal to the Court of Appeal and House of Lords. She also prosecuted in environmental cases for Greenpeace.

In 1994 she represented the defendant in &quot;R v Carol Peters&quot; (the appeal and retrial), in which the Court of Appeal quashed Peters&#x27; murder conviction (alleged temazepam poisoning and the inflicting of 39 stab wounds on her husband) and ordered a retrial. At the retrial Peters was acquitted of murder, the defence being that she was suffering from battered woman syndrome, at the time an undeveloped area of law and fact. She also represented Emma Humphreys on appeal, a disadvantaged young woman convicted of murdering her violent pimp when she was 17 years old. The case drew attention to battered women who kill their violent partners and underpinned legislative changes subsequently made by the Labour Government when Baird was a minister. Baird acted for many other abused women following the Humphreys case and the legal changes that it brought about. 

Other high-profile cases Baird has been involved in include the representation of murderer Jane Andrews in an appeal. She defended prisoners accused of rioting at Risley Remand Centre and at Strangeways Prison and continued to represent campaigners in many kinds of protest case.

In 2000 Baird took silk, 25 years after becoming a barrister.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 1983 general election, Baird contested the constituency of Berwick-upon-Tweed, finishing in third place behind the victor Alan Beith. Despite the party&#x27;s landslide defeat nationally, she received an increase in the Labour vote. At the 2001 general election she was selected to contest Labour&#x27;s then ultra-safe seat of Redcar, following the retirement of the sitting MP and former Cabinet minister, Mo Mowlam. Baird won with 7% smaller vote than Mowlam, taking the seat with a large majority.

In 2004 Baird served on a number of select committees between 2001 and 2005 including Joint Select Committee on Human Rights 2001–2003 and the Select Committee on Work and Pensions between 2003 and 2005.

Baird was re-elected at the 2005 general election with a reduction in her majority. She then became the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Home Secretary, Charles Clarke.

On 8 May 2006, she was appointed as a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the Department for Constitutional Affairs – which was renamed the Ministry of Justice in May 2007, following the reorganisation of the Home Office. In June 2007, newly appointed Prime Minister Gordon Brown appointed Baird Solicitor General for England and Wales.

In 2006 Baird commented that in calculating the sentence of a sex offender the judge had been too lenient; she retracted the comments after her boss Lord Falconer supported the judge saying the fault lay not with the judiciary but with sentencing guidelines. Judge Keith Cutler later suggested that criticism from ministers including Baird and Home Secretary John Reid could force judges to break their tradition of silence when criticised.

In 2009 Baird helped establish the Stern Review on the way rape cases are handled, an independent report by Baroness Stern, it was published in March 2010 concluding that there needed to be a greater focus on victims.

In the recession beginning in mid-2008 the worldwide price of steel halved over a period of 6 months, steel production worldwide reduced and in the UK the blast furnace at Teesside Steelworks Corus was eventually shut down on 19 February 2010. The whole plant was then mothballed following the withdrawal of an international consortium that had been considering the purchase of the plant. There were over a thousand redundancies and the future of Redcar, as a steel town was undermined. A major regional campaign to save the steelworks was operating but, despite receiving praise for her own personal efforts in the campaign which had included a trip to Italy in an attempt to persuade Marcegaglia, the leading consortium business to keep to the contract, the view was that the Labour Government had failed to save the steelworks. Baird lost her seat in the House of Commons on 7 May 2010 at the 2010 general election, with a 21.8% swing, the largest against Labour in the general election and the first time in the short history of the constituency the Labour Party had ever lost the seat in Redcar.

=== Backbencher ===
Baird was a frequent backbench speaker, winning adjournment debates on diverse national and local issues and in 2004 she was awarded &quot;The Spectator&quot; Backbencher of the Year Award. During her time as an MP Baird was a member of both the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Inter-Parliamentary Union. She delivered lectures at conferences on democracy, gender and human rights in many locations around the world and carried out election monitoring duties on nine occasions.

She was a notable figure in several Parliamentary campaigns including that to remove the rule where pensioners going into hospital had to surrender their pension and reapply on discharge and in another campaign that sought, successfully, to amend National Insurance and other rules – the amendments meaning that the number of women who qualified for the Basic State Pension was greatly increased.

Higher profile campaigns included her involvement in a Commons revolt against derogation from Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights in which Baird often took the lead in Parliament and the blocking of the partial abolition of jury trial proposed in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 through the proposal of amendments in the Commons. Bob Marshall-Andrews, another MP opposed to the abolition of jury trials, gave credit to Baird&#x27;s efforts by stating &quot;Saving jury trial was a singular victory and the one of which, in thirteen years at Westminster, I remain most proud. Without Vera&#x27;s voice we would probably have lost and that remains, as they say, big medicine.&quot;

During her time as a backbencher, Baird was involved in various activities and work outside of Parliament. She designed and delivered courses, in consecutive years, for the British Council on aspects of criminal, civil and family law firstly for Ethiopian judiciary and secondly to the Ethiopian Police Service. She was a Fellow of the Norfolk Trust in Summer 2004, visiting New Zealand, South America and East Africa to study her own topic of violence against women and, as is the obligation to the Trust, to study the chosen topics of her 3 Co-Fellows, which were HIV/AIDs, environmental issues in connection with mineral extraction and Health Service delivery.

Baird was a patron of the Jubilee Debt Campaign of EVA-Women&#x27;s Aid of FOCAS (autistic charity) and ROC (disabled charity). She was chair of the Fawcett Commission on Women and Criminal Justice 2002 – 2006. This latter was a seminal review of women as defendant, as victims &amp; witnesses and as workers in the criminal justice system which triggered a number of major legislative and non-legislative changes including the Corston Review on Women with Vulnerabilities in Prison. Baroness Corston succeeded Baird as commission chair when Baird became a minister. Baird worked with MIND on strategies to make the criminal courts more responsive to people with mental illness or learning difficulties and was secretary of the Parliamentary Labour Party Women&#x27;s Committee.

During her time as MP and before she became a PPS, Baird was active in the Parliamentary Committee system. She was a member of the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee 2003–2005 : scrutinising the work of the DWP. Influential Reports included on Women and Pensions and Child Support Agency, the latter bringing the demise this failed organisation; a member of the Joint Select Committee on Human Rights 2001–2003 : joint Lords-Commons Committee scrutinising legislation for compliance with European Convention on Human Rights. Influential reports include recommending the establishment of the Equality and Human Rights Commission; a member of the Pre-Legislative Scrutiny Committee on various constitution and democracy proposals including the Corruption Bill 2003 (With others on the committee, Baird was instrumental in ensuring the rejection of the Corruption Bill, which would not have complied with international obligations); a member of the Pre-Legislative Scrutiny Committee of the Armed Forces Bill 2005–2006: 

The committee approved the bill with modifications, in particular about reform to the Court Martial system; elected onto a large number of House of Commons Standing Committees (now (2012) known as General Committees, they conduct detailed scrutiny of proposed legislation) including: Export Control Bill 2002, Proceeds of Crime Bill 2002, Criminal Justice Bill 2003, Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill 2004, Sexual Offences Bill 2003, Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill 2005, Pensions Bill 2004, Housing Bill 2004; the chair of All Party Parliamentary Groups on: Burma (jointly with John Bercow MP), On Equalities, for Citizens Advice, on Steel Industry, on Domestic and Sexual Violence; a member of All Party Parliamentary Groups on Ethiopia, Botswana, Tanzania, Great Lakes Region, India, the Falklands, Seaside Towns, Town Centre Management, Cancer Research, Cardiac Arrest in the Young and Animal Welfare.

=== Solicitor General for England and Wales: 2007–2010 ===
In June 2007 Baird became the Solicitor General for England and Wales, the senior law officer in the House of Commons and the government&#x27;s chief legal adviser and criminal justice minister, a position she held jointly with the attorney general, Baroness Scotland.

As senior law officer Baird was responsible, together with the attorney general, for the Law Office budget and for setting the strategic direction for the Crown Prosecution Service, Serious Fraud Office, Service Prosecuting Authority (covering the Armed Forces) Treasury Solicitor&#x27;s Department, Government Legal Service and Her Majesty&#x27;s Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate as well as giving lead ministerial sponsorship to the National Fraud Authority. At this time the law officers also oversaw the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland. A further aspect of the role of solicitor general for England and Wales is the requirement for close liaison with various police bodies including the strategic level Association of Chief Police Officers (APCO).

As a senior law officer, Baird held the responsibility, together with the attorney general, for protecting the independence of prosecutors; for providing legal advice to over 20 Whitehall departments and for taking action on contempt of court, (typically when press reporting of criminal cases may inappropriately influence their outcome). She represented the Government in court, in particular in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division on Unduly Lenient Sentence appeals, asking the Appeal Court to increase too lenient Crown Court sentences. She advised on charities law where there were disputes in which the State had an interest. The law officers advise on whether Bills are compatible with the Human Rights Act 1998.

As solicitor general, Baird – together with the attorney general – developed a &quot;pro bono&quot; committee to focus and streamline the availability of free legal advice. They set up the Access to Justice Foundation, to hold costs from pro bono cases and changed the law to allow lawyers who have acted on a for free basis to apply for costs to be put into the fund to support the organisation for future free legal work.

Baird and Scotland oversaw the introduction of Associate Prosecutors, extending the powers of less qualified prosecutors to present cases in the magistrates&#x27; courts, to save fully qualified solicitors from the need to conduct small case, so freeing them to prepare serious work for the Crown Court. They also developed and oversaw the introduction of CPS Online, a phone line for police charging advice.

With the attorney general, Baird, as sponsor minister, deployed a budget of £28 million to implement the recommendations of the 2006 Fraud Review and established the National Fraud Authority (NFA), which became an executive agency of the Law Officers Departments (LODs) in 2008 with Dr Bernard Herdan as its chief executive.

Baird was a senior member of the Inter-Ministerial Group which oversaw the NFA and the co-ordination of the UK&#x27;s first National Fraud Strategy in partnership with over 28 public private and trade bodies. In April 2008, the City of London Police was established as the Lead Force on fraud, to take over complex investigations and strengthen skills and expertise in the police nationwide. In its first year took on 71 major cases involving losses to victims estimated at £1 billion. The National Fraud Intelligence Bureau was established and Baird spoke at key events, such as the Fraud Advisory Panel&#x27;s Conference to promote co-ordinated action against fraud and in particular present a new focus on prevention and protection of what had historically and wrongly been seen as a victimless crime.

In June 2007 the Law Officers approved the enhanced Digital Forensic Unit, a £1 million facility expanding the ability of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) to retrieve information from computers and other devices seized in investigations.

In April 2008 Richard Alderman was appointed to transform the Serious Fraud Office following the highly critical De Grazia Report.

Baird and Scotland launched the Prosecutors&#x27; Convention to streamline the operations of over 40 prosecuting bodies such as the Civil Aviation Authority, Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Financial Services Authority and the Office of Fair Trading.

Baird launched the Homophobic Hate Crime strategy and a Race and Religious Hate Crime strategy, with Sir Ken Macdonald and in 2008 with the CPS launched the first public policy on cases of crime against older people.

The CPS launched its first ever violence against women strategy in 2007, the first in Government and this resulted in policies on the prosecution or rape and domestic violence being updated and publicly launched.

Baird attended the Victims&#x27; Advisory Panel where victims informed of Government policy. She visited several joint CPS and Police Witness Care Unit s to develop the information and support for witnesses. She supported the roll-out of the Witness Intermediaries&#x27; Scheme, which provides support for witnesses with communication difficulties and the introduction of new offences to support those at risk of intimidation. Sara Payne was appointed as the first independent Victims&#x27; Champion with a role to listen to the views and concerns of victims and witnesses, and to challenge criminal justice agencies to improve their practices..

Baird was a member of the National Criminal Justice Board which co-ordinates the agencies which collectively make up the Criminal Justice system. Here she worked with the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, the chair of the Association of Police Authorities, the Judiciary, Probation and other agencies.

Baird was Ministerial sponsor of the Cleveland Local Criminal Justice Board and of the West Yorkshire LCJB.

=== Parliamentary Expenses Scandal ===

Baird was the subject of claims in newspapers at the time of the expenses scandal but, along with those of other MPs, her claims were investigated by Sir Paul Kennedy who found that she had claimed only for payments she was entitled to receive.

==Police and Crime Commissioner==
===First term===
Baird was elected to the post of Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner on 15 November 2012.

Despite it being Labour Party policy throughout the first years of Baird&#x27;s tenure to do away with PCCs, Baird, a Labour Party member and former Labour Solicitor General, continued to promote the role. In 2016 the Labour Party changed its policy towards PCCs, the party leader describing the role as being &quot;vital in a changing world&quot;.

Baird placed responses to domestic and sexual violence at the core of her PCC role and sought to integrate police work into a multi-agency strategic hub (MASH) where the focus is on the care for the victim.

In response to a 2014 report from Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) reviewing the police response to domestic abuse, the Home Secretary, Theresa May, set up a National Oversight Group to drive delivery against the eleven national recommendations given in the HMIC report. Baird became a member of the Oversight Group representing Labour PCCs. The first update on the National Oversight Group was published in December 2014.

After considering the circumstances of a rape incident in Newcastle in 2012, Baird promoted the development of new national training requirements for all door staff. These new requirements were instituted by the Security Industry Authority (SIA) in November 2013.

Together with two other North East region PCCs Baird launched the first regional Violence Against Women And Girls Strategy (VAWG) in November 2013. The strategy detailed a 20-point plan to tackle domestic and sexual abuse, trafficking and sex work, forced marriage, &quot;honour crimes&quot;, harassment, stalking and female genital mutilation.

As a part of Northumbria&#x27;s PCC VAWG strategy in February 2015:
* a Court Observer Panel was established. Consisting of volunteers, this panel monitors rape and sexual abuse court cases and reports back to the criminal justice agencies on possible improvements that may be made in the support of victims. 
* a Rape Scrutiny Panel was established. This panel consists of ten specially-trained volunteers from the voluntary and community sectors with expertise in the subject. Their task is to examine case files where it&#x27;s judged that no crime has been committed, or where it is said that a case has not achieved the required threshold of evidence to be sent to the Crown Prosecution Service. The Panel also examines failed prosecutions, to look for ways to improve the process for future occasions.
Baird&#x27;s office founded a network of Workplace Domestic Violence Champions. Trained by the PCC Office and given ongoing support by the PCC Office, these &quot;Champions&quot; – employees nominated by their companies – are intended to provide a safe haven for anyone suffering domestic violence in the workplace. By 2016, some 600 such &quot;Champions&quot; had been created.

Leading on from the above work, in August 2018 Baird asked the North of England Soroptimists International and her Court Observers Panel to focus their attention on the work of Special Domestic Violence Courts (SDVC). These courts were rolled out across the country in 2005 and 2006 as part of a three-pronged initiative to provide more informed and safer hearings for Domestic Violence cases.

Specialist Volunteer Court Observers trained by the CPS observed 170 cases from July to September 2017 which resulted in the production of the &quot;Specialist Domestic Violence Courts - How Special are they?&quot; report. The report found significant gaps in the system and stated that if funding was improved, SDVCs would work as was originally intended. The report also makes a number of recommendations for how the SDVC&#x27;s can be improved to deliver for victims.

===Second term===
Baird was re-elected to the post of Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner in May 2016 with a majority of 121,766.

In May 2016 Baird was elected to the position of chair by the board of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners.

In August 2016 Baird called for personal, social and health education (PSHE) to be a compulsory part of the national curriculum to assist in combating child abuse.

In December 2016 Baird, together with Northumbria Police, launched the &quot;Words Leave Scars Too&quot; campaign which sought to raise awareness of emotional abuse and its impact.

In 2017 Baird became a Patron for the charity Operation Encompass.

== Victims&#x27; Commissioner ==
Baird was appointed as Victims&#x27; Commissioner for England and Wales in May 2019, taking up the position in mid-June of that year. The role of the Commissioner is set out in the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004. Her resignation letter in September 2022 accused the government of downgrading victims&#x27; interests and side-lining the role, at the same time as the criminal justice system was &quot;in chaos&quot;. 

Baird later said that in her opinion Dominic Raab wanted a &quot;puppet on a string&quot; and his proposed bill of rights would undermine the rights of victims. The bill of rights tries to make it clear UK courts are not bound by rulings from the European court of human rights and would, in Baird&#x27;s opinion destroy &quot;any positive impact from the victims&#x27; bill&quot;. Baird said that women and girls, who were victims of violence would be less able to push the police to perform better. Baird maintained the case of Sarah Everard and what happened since then showed victims rights should not be weakened now.

==Personal life==

Baird married David Taylor-Gooby in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1972. They divorced in 1978 and she married Robert Brian Baird (born July 1928) in the same year in County Durham. A year later, in 1979, Brian Baird died from complications following open heart surgery. She has two stepsons from him. Her interests outside politics include sport and reading. She lives in South Gosforth, Newcastle.

<text>Norman John Baker (born 26 July 1957) is a Liberal Democrat politician in the United Kingdom who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Lewes in East Sussex from the 1997 general election until his defeat in 2015.

In May 2010 he was appointed as Parliamentary under-secretary of state in the Department for Transport. On 7 October 2013, Baker was promoted to Minister of State at the Home Office in the coalition government of 2010–15. He resigned from his role at the Home Office on 3 November 2014.

==Early life==
Baker was born in Aberdeen, but his family moved to Hornchurch in east London in 1968. He was educated at the Royal Liberty School in Gidea Park, near Romford, and at Royal Holloway College, University of London, graduating in 1978 with a BA degree in German &amp; History.

Baker joined the Liberal Party in 1981 while living in Islington and in his memoir he described himself as a &#x27;sleeping&#x27; party member save for one canvassing session in six years. In 1985 he joined the then Ecology Party before seeking his first council seat in Ouse Valley ward of Lewes District Council in 1987. Two years later in 1989 was also elected to the local county council of East Sussex. He became the Leader of Lewes District Council in 1991, a position he held until his election as an MP in 1997.

Outside of politics Baker was a regional director for Our Price Records for five years from 1978. He worked at Malling Street Service Station, Lewes, from 1983 to 1985. He taught English as a foreign language from 1985 to 1997, with a spell as a Liberal Democrat environment researcher in the House of Commons in 1989–90.

==Parliamentary career==
Baker contested Lewes at the 1992 general election, but the sitting Conservative Party MP Tim Rathbone retained the seat. He stood again at the 1997 election, and this time gained the seat with a majority of 1,300 votes over Rathbone, becoming Lewes&#x27;s first non-Conservative MP since 1874.

Baker prided himself on &quot;uncovering scandals and conflicts of interest among MPs and the government&quot;. His consistent questioning of Peter Mandelson may have helped lead to Mandelson&#x27;s second resignation from government. He also raised issues about Lord Birt and his role as Tony Blair&#x27;s adviser. After compiling figures in 2002, which revealed that the government&#x27;s fleet of ministerial cars had grown to its largest ever size, he began in January 2005 to campaign to force disclosure of the details of MPs&#x27; expenses under the Freedom of Information Act, finally succeeding in February 2007. His success enabled &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; to publish details of his own expense claims, which included £3,000 for office rental. 

In October 2001 he won a test case in the High Court, when the National Security Appeals panel ruled that the Data Protection Act required the security service MI5 to allow him access to information which he believed the security service holds on him, the first time this had happened in the 92-year history of MI5. In 2001 he was named &quot;Inquisitor of the Year&quot; in &quot;The Spectator&quot; Parliamentarian of the Year Awards, and in February 2002 he won the Channel 4 Opposition MP of the Year Award.

Baker is regarded as coming from the left-wing of the party, and until losing his seat was a member of the Beveridge Group within the Liberal Democrats. A staunch republican, he is also well known for his vocal support for animal rights groups, and he is a strong proponent for greater protection of animals under law. In 1997, &quot;The Times&quot; columnist Matthew Parris described him as a &quot;classic House of Commons bore&quot;, and in the Commons in 2002, Labour MP Stephen Pound likened his speeches to &quot;root canal surgery without anaesthetic&quot;, but Parris added in 2001 &quot;You underestimate him at your peril. He has a habit of being right.&quot; He asked two parliamentary questions of the Ministry of Defence in 2006 and 2007 on the subject of what the Ministry calls &quot;unexplained aerial phenomena&quot; including: &quot;To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether his Department&#x27;s unidentified flying objects project is extant; and if he will make a statement.&quot;

Following the 2008 Camp for Climate Action at the coal-fired Kingsnorth power station in Kent (since demolished), Baker called for an investigation into police tactics, saying he had witnessed unnecessarily aggressive policing and unprovoked violence against peaceful protesters during the event.

===Front-bench career===
In the 2001–05 Parliament, Baker was a member of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, and was appointed as Liberal Democrat Environment spokesman in 2002, a post he held until his resignation in 2006 following the election of Sir Menzies Campbell as party leader.

As Environment spokesman in May 2005, he joined with two former environment ministers, the Labour MP Michael Meacher and the Conservative John Gummer, to table a cross-party Early day motion No. 178 in support of a Climate Change Bill drafted by Friends of the Earth. The motion called for a Bill to be &quot;brought forward in this Parliament so that annual cuts in carbon dioxide emissions of 3 per cent can be delivered in a framework that includes regular reporting and new scrutiny and corrective processes&quot; and attracted 412 signatures. Baker also opposed nuclear power, describing it as &quot;hopelessly uneconomic&quot;, and warning that new nuclear power stations &quot;would generate vast quantities of nuclear waste and divert essential funding away from energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy.&quot;

He returned to the front bench in July 2007, when he was appointed as Liberal Democrat spokesman on the Cabinet Office and the Duchy of Lancaster. In December 2007, after the election of Nick Clegg as party leader, Baker (who had supported Clegg in the leadership contest) returned to the front bench as spokesman on Transport.

===David Kelly===
Baker announced on 19 May 2006 that he had decided to step down from the Liberal Democrats&#x27; front bench to pursue a quest to establish the truth behind the death in 2003 of David Kelly, an expert in biological warfare employed by the Ministry of Defence and a former United Nations weapons inspector in Iraq. Kelly&#x27;s discussion with BBC &quot;Today&quot; programme journalist Andrew Gilligan about the British government&#x27;s dossier on weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq inadvertently caused a major political scandal. Kelly had been found dead days after appearing before the Parliamentary committee investigating the scandal.

The Hutton Inquiry, a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his death, ruled that he had committed suicide and that Kelly had not in fact said some of the things attributed to him by Gilligan. Baker said that Hutton had &quot;blatantly failed to get to the bottom of matters&quot;, and that &quot;the more I look into it the less convinced I am by the explanation and the more unanswered questions appear which ought to have been addressed properly by the Hutton inquiry or by the coroner.&quot;

In July that year, Baker claimed that data had been wiped from the hard drive on one of his computers. Although some news reports suggested that this related to evidence showing Kelly&#x27;s death was not a suicide, Baker maintained that none of his research on Kelly had been stored on that particular machine. In April 2007 he announced his findings, telling a meeting in Lewes:I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that this could not be suicide. The medical evidence does not support it and David Kelly&#x27;s state of mind and personality suggests otherwise. It was not an accident so I am left with the conclusion that it is murder.&quot;

His book, &quot;The Strange Death of David Kelly&quot;, was published in October 2007, and serialised in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. Some relatives of Kelly have expressed their displeasure at the publication. The husband of Kelly&#x27;s sister Sarah said &quot;It is just raking over old bones ... I can&#x27;t speak for the whole family, but I&#x27;ve read it all [Baker&#x27;s theories], every word, and I don&#x27;t believe it.&quot; However, Baker writes in the book that other relatives of Kelly also think his death was suspicious.

===Censure===
In December 2007, Baker was criticised, but not fined by the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges for a newsletter which contained an &quot;advertising feature&quot; about a Liberal Democrat MEP. The Committee&#x27;s report concluded: &quot;We agree with the Commissioner that this element of Mr Donovan&#x27;s complaint should be upheld, and we reiterate that the inclusion of material of a party political nature is not permissible in publications funded from parliamentary allowances.&quot;

===Tibet===
Baker is President of the Tibet Society, and was a member of the UK All Party Parliamentary Group for Tibet.

In February 2008 he released a statement to mark International Mother Language Day saying &quot;The Chinese government are following a deliberate policy of extinguishing all that is Tibetan, including their own language in their own country. It may be obvious, but Tibetan should be the official language of Tibet.&quot; Tibetan is an official language of Tibet and other Tibetan-inhabited areas in China. In school, the younger grades are taught in Tibetan for new ideas, but the rest is in Mandarin Chinese including for concepts in sciences and maths.

On 18 March 2008 he addressed Tibetan protesters outside the Chinese embassy in London, and also delivered a letter to Prime Minister Gordon Brown from six Tibetan students in the UK who were supporting Tibetans in the 2008 Tibetan unrest. The students&#x27; letter called for an end to the unrest&#x27;s suppression, a UN investigation into it, and for unfettered media access in Tibet.

In March 2010, the BBC ran an investigation detailing 37 occasions that Baker failed to declare a financial interest in Tibet during parliamentary debates and questions, despite receiving hospitality from the Tibetan government-in-exile. Baker released a statement saying that it was an oversight.

===Coalition Government===
At the 2010 general election Baker was again returned as MP for Lewes. The Liberal Democrats entered a coalition agreement with the Conservative Party on 11 May 2010, and Baker was appointed Parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Department for Transport.

In 2013, Baker was quoted as saying that rail fares were &quot;not that expensive&quot; when compared to fares for rail travel in other countries, and that deals that were available reduced the price significantly. This was against fare increases of more than 50% for &quot;the average season ticket&quot; between 2003 and 2013.

In the October 2013 reshuffle, Baker was appointed to the Home Office as Minister of State, overseeing issues relating to national security, replacing fellow Liberal Democrat Jeremy Browne. In this role he repeatedly suggested changes to drug policy, saying that patients should have access to cannabis for cancer pain relief and multiple sclerosis and that all options regarding legal highs were under consideration. The Home Office repeatedly rejected progressive suggestions.

In December 2013, it was reported that Baker had encouraged the Director of Public Prosecutions to reopen or reconsider six cases involving female genital mutilation, as forbidden by the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985. Although this law had been on the books since 1985, there had been no prosecutions under it until February 2014, when it was announced that the first was scheduled soon thereafter. The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; estimated that, up to that point, 170,000 women had been subject to the assault. A doctor was the first person charged with an offence contrary to the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 in March 2014.

He was appointed a member of the Privy Council in 2014, giving him the right to the Honorific Title &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life.

Baker resigned from the Home Office on 3 November 2014, citing conflicts with Home Secretary Theresa May. On the same day, he described being the only Liberal Democrat in the Home Office as like being &quot;a hippy at an Iron Maiden concert&quot;.

===2015 general election===
On two occasions in the run-up to the election, the Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg visited the towns of Seaford, Lewes and Newhaven (which are within the Lewes constituency) with Baker. At the election Baker&#x27;s majority of over 7,000 was overturned by the Conservative candidate Maria Caulfield, a nurse who beat him by 1,083 votes.



==Life after Parliament==
In 2015, Baker, a keen music enthusiast, re-formed his old band The Reform Club, which announced that it would be releasing an album of 15 original songs on 25 March. Baker is the chief lyricist with music written by Mike Phipps. The band also includes Geoff Smith on bass and vocals, Chris Dartnell on drums and vocals, Mike Phipps on guitars, keyboards and vocals, Brian Wiseman on lead guitar and vocals, with Maxwell Gardner on guitar for live appearances. A second album, &quot;Never yesterday&quot;, is awaiting release. As Norman Baker and Friends, he released a four-track EP, &quot;Animal Countdown&quot;, in March 2015, which highlights the plight of endangered species. He also presents two radio shows on the local community radio station Seahaven FM, &quot;The Hidden 60s&quot; on Monday evenings and &quot;Anything Goes&quot; on Sunday mornings.

Baker&#x27;s political memoir &quot;Against The Grain&quot; was published on 18 September 2015. In an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper on 11 August he said he had no intention of seeking election again.

Baker was the managing director of The Big Lemon, a bus operator based in Brighton, from March 2017 to January 2018.

On 15 October 2019, Baker’s book, &quot;... And What Do You Do?: What The Royal Family Don&#x27;t Want You To Know&quot;, which critically examined the Royal Family&#x27;s privileged status in public life, was released by Biteback Publishing.

On 10 September 2022, Baker attended the Accession Council for the Proclamation of King Charles III at St James&#x27;s Palace, London.

<text>Sir Antony Brian Baldry, (born 10 July 1950) is a British Conservative Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Banbury from 1983 to 2015.

==Early life==
Born in 1950, Baldry was educated at Leighton Park School, a Quaker school, and the University of Sussex where he read law. During his university years, Baldry was actively involved in student politics and, whilst attending Sussex, took the Students&#x27; Union to the High Court on the grounds that the Students&#x27; Union was making &quot;ultra vires&quot; payments out of Student Union funds to various political organisations. The case of &quot;Baldry v Feintuck&quot; is notable in legal history for defining the legal status of students&#x27; unions for the first time.

In 1975, Baldry was called to the Bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and became a common lawyer, joining the Oxford and Midlands Circuit.

==Military service==
In 1971, whilst at university, Baldry joined the Sussex Yeomanry. On 19 May 1974, he was commissioned into the Royal Artillery, Territorial Army (TA), as a second lieutenant (on probation). He was given the service number 498590. His commission and rank were confirmed on 19 May 1974. He was promoted to lieutenant on 19 May 1976, and to captain on 18 February 1981.

He retired from the TA on 1 April 1990 with the rank of acting major.

==Political career==
Baldry began his political career in the February 1974 general election, serving as personal assistant to Maurice Macmillan, then Chief Secretary to the Treasury and in the October 1974 general election, he was personal assistant to Margaret Thatcher. When Thatcher later became Leader of the Conservative Party in 1975, Baldry joined her Private Office, working as the link between Thatcher and the &quot;Britain in Europe Campaign&quot; and the &quot;Yes&quot; Campaign, for the 1975 EU referendum. Baldry was active in the European movement and won the Robert Schumann Silver Medal in 1978 for contributions to Europe.

Baldry was first selected as a parliamentary candidate for the Thurrock constituency for the 1979 general election where he secured one of the largest swings to the Conservative Party, reducing a 19,000 Labour majority at the last general election to 6,400.

Following the retirement of veteran Banbury Conservative MP Neil Marten, Baldry successfully contested the seat at the 1983 general election and was elected to Parliament with a majority of 13,025.

From 1985 to 1990, Baldry was a Parliamentary Private Secretary, successively to Lynda Chalker and John Wakeham, who was leader of the House of Commons. In January 1990 Margaret Thatcher made Baldry a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department of Energy, where he helped John Wakeham privatise the electricity industry. Baldry was one of the last of those made a Minister by Margaret Thatcher still to be in the House of Commons.

Following the election of John Major as prime minister in November 1990, Michael Heseltine asked that Baldry move to the Department for the Environment, where he stayed for four years covering every aspect of the department&#x27;s work including housing, planning, Local Government and construction.

In 1994 Baldry moved to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to cover in the House of Commons for Lynda Chalker who was the Minister for Overseas Development but in the House of Lords. As a consequence, he spoke for the Government on International Development in the House of Commons.

In 1995 he was promoted to the rank of Minister of State at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food – where he had to grapple with the twin problems of BSE and increasingly unpopular EU fisheries policies – a position he held until the fall of the Major government in 1997. His civil servants nicknamed him &#x27;Baldrick&#x27;.

On 21 June 2010, Baldry was appointed Second Church Estates Commissioner, with responsibility for answering questions in the House in a manner similar to questions to ministers on the work of the Church Commissioners.

In the 2010 general election Baldry was re-elected with an increased majority, of 18,227 votes.

Following the 2010 general election, he became co-chair of the APPG on Agriculture and Food for Development along with Lord Cameron of Dillington, and joined the Ecclesiastical Select Committee.

Baldry announced his decision to stand down as an MP at the May 2015 general election on 1 September 2014.

Following his retirement from the House of Commons in 2015 he was appointed as the chair of the Church Buildings Council succeeding Anne Sloman. He stepped down on 11 July 2019 and was replaced by the vice chair Jennie Page

==International development==
Tony Baldry is a member of the Council of the Overseas Development Institute, was vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Overseas Development (Apgood), a Trustee of Friends of Africa, which is a UK-based charity, and a Trustee of Afghan Action, a UK-based charity working in Afghanistan. He was one of eleven MPs to volunteer for the VSO&#x27;s project PolVol in 2008. He is on the council of governors of Chatham House.

From 2001 to 2005, Baldry chaired the House of Commons Select Committee on International Development. Since the summer of 2009, Baldry had chaired the Conservative Party&#x27;s Commission on Human Rights.

==Public behaviour==

===Personal loan===
In January 1997, Baldry accepted from Sarosh Zaiwalla (a prominent London solicitor), a £5,000 personal loan, on which he paid interest. Baldry gave Lord Feldman (Chairman of the Conservative Party in London at the time) a letter of support for a recommendation of a public honour that Lord Feldman was making on behalf of Sarosh Zaiwalla. It was later held by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards that in that reference or separately, Baldry should have declared that he was at the time a beneficiary of a loan from Sarosh Zaiwalla. Baldry was consequently ordered to apologise to the House over the incident.

===Sierra Leone===
In January 2005 Baldry wrote to Hilary Benn, Secretary for International Development, on behalf of Milestone Trading, a British company involved in diamond mining in Sierra Leone. He asked Benn whether his department could endorse the company as conforming to &quot;best practices&quot; in the diamond industry. In his letter to Benn, which was written on House of Commons notepaper, he did not reveal that Milestone had paid $75,000 into a company in which he was a one-third shareholder.

Benn replied that the government &quot;could not endorse an individual company&#x27;s activities&quot;. At the time Baldry was the chairman of the House of Commons International Development Committee. He had also written letters to the president and vice-president of Sierra Leone on behalf of Milestone in late 2004.

Baldry also sent a series of letters on Angelgate Aviation notepaper from St James&#x27;s Square (seen by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards) to Sierra Leone Vice President Solomon Berewa on behalf of Angel Gate Aviation, a company that was trying to set up flights between London and Freetown.

In investigating this case, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards concluded that Baldry should not have used House of Commons notepaper in the letter to Benn. Baldry consequently made an apology to the House for the use of House stationery; however, the Commissioner stated that he found no indication whatsoever, in the course of his inquiry, that Mr Baldry had sought to exploit his position as Chairman of the International Development Committee to further his private interests. The parliamentary Standards and Privileges Committee observed that &quot;Baldry did not comply with the House&#x27;s requirements in respect of the declarations of interests.&quot;

===James Ibori===
In September 2009 Baldry, in his capacity as a barrister instructed by the solicitor Sarosh Zaiwalla, wrote a letter to Foreign Secretary David Miliband on behalf of Nigerian state governor James Ibori, who was under investigation by Scotland Yard for corruption. The &quot;Oxford Mail&quot; reported that Mr Baldry had been &quot;paid more than £37,000 for 29 hours&#x27; work between September and December by Sarosh Zaiwalla, a London-based solicitor who had acted for the Ibori family&quot;. Later that same month, &quot;The Independent&quot; printed a correction and an apology over a report in which they had suggested that Tony Baldry had &quot;lobbied&quot; on behalf of James Ibori. The correction clarified that Mr Baldry had not lobbied on Mr Ibori&#x27;s behalf, and supported his claim that despite it being contrary to legal protocol, he had written to the Foreign Secretary in his capacity as a barrister, and not as an MP. It was reported in issue 1320 of the &quot;Private Eye&quot; that Baldry&#x27;s own libel solicitor had described the letter&#x27;s purpose as pointing out that once the case was resolved &quot;relevant agencies might want to reflect on lessons learned&quot;.

==== Panama Papers ====

Tony Baldry was named in the Panama Papers. He was chairman of Westminster Oil Ltd, which was a company registered in the British Virgin Islands. Westminster Oil owned a second company called Westminster Caspian, which was active in Kazakhstan. When asked why the company was registered in the British Virgin Islands, Baldry said, &quot;Given that the project was based in Kazakhstan, and given that the directors and shareholders came from the United States, the United Kingdom and Kazakhstan, whatever jurisdiction was chosen to register the company would inevitably have been &#x27;offshore&#x27; to a number of the shareholders and directors&quot;, according to a quote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

==Political funding==
The Banbury Conservative Constituency Association has received £481,521.32 according to searchthemoney.com. Baldry has received £86,659.32 in remunerations for work done since 2010 from Woburn Energy Plc, an oil- and gas-related company. As of 2012, for work done for Zaiwalla and Co. solicitors, Baldry has been compensated £162,200 in remunerations.

==Personal life==
Baldry is a practising barrister and Head of Chambers at 1 Essex Court in the Temple, London.

He lives in Bloxham, a village about three miles away from Banbury. He married his second wife, Pippa, on 25 May 2001 and has two children, Honor and Edward, from his first marriage.

Baldry is a declared Freemason and has made speeches to parliament on the subject. In 1998 Baldry described himself as &quot;the only surviving member of the Grand Lodge in the House&quot; and in subsequent interviews stated that he was aware of &quot;about a dozen&quot; fellow MPs who were active Freemasons (although not necessarily, like him, members of the Grand Lodge).

According to the Register of Member&#x27;s Interests and on his website, Baldry confirms alongside his parliamentary duties that he is a Director of Westminster Oil (&quot;development of oil licences and exploration&quot;), West Africa Investments (&quot;investing in infrastructure and natural resource projects in Sierra Leone and elsewhere in West Africa&quot;), Halcyon Oil (&quot;a Hong Kong registered company focusing on oil exploration and discovery projects in Central Asia&quot;). He is a director of Mastermailer Holdings plc, and Deputy Chair of Woburn Energy plc, a company &quot;specialising in oil exploration and recovery&quot;.

In September 2012 it was reported that Baldry crashed his car into four stationary vehicles, a bollard, and a portable toilet while attempting to park. Police breath tests later proved negative.

==Honours==
Baldry was knighted in the 2012 Birthday Honours for public and political service.

In 2016 the dormant title of High Steward of Banbury was revived for Baldry. He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant for the County of Oxfordshire on 4 February 2016. This gave him the Post Nominal Letters &quot;DL&quot; for Life.

In 2016, he was awarded the Langton Award for Community Service by the Archbishop of Canterbury &quot;for his community service, especially as an advocate for the continuing contribution of parish churches to the common good&quot;.

<doc id="414436" wikidata="Q1404866" url="?curid=414436" title="Ken Lucas (politician)">
<text>Kenneth Ray Lucas (born August 22, 1933) is an American politician. Lucas, a Democrat, was a U.S. Representative from Kentucky&#x27;s 4th congressional district from 1999 until 2005.

Lucas did not run for reelection in 2004, honoring a promise to serve only three terms. However, he made a bid for his old congressional seat in 2006 against Geoff Davis, the Republican who won the seat in 2004. Lucas narrowly defeated Davis in 2002, even as popular Republican Senator Mitch McConnell breezed to a fourth term in a big midterm cycle for Republicans.

On February 2, 2009, he was appointed as Commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Veterans Affairs by Governor Steve Beshear.

==Life and career==
Lucas was born in Covington, Kentucky and grew up on a dairy and tobacco farm in Grant County. He attended the University of Kentucky, graduating in 1955. Lucas received his MBA from Xavier University in 1970. He served for 12 years in the Air Force, later serving in the Air National Guard and retiring as a major. He then became a certified financial planner.

From 1967 to 1974, Lucas was a city councilman in Florence; after this, he became a county commissioner in Boone County until 1982. In 1992, he was elected county judge-executive of Boone County, and in 1998 he ran successfully for the House.

Lucas&#x27; 1998 victory came as something of a surprise even though Democrats have a substantial majority in registration. He was the first Democrat to represent this district since 1967. Due to the influence of the Cincinnati suburbs, it was widely considered one of the most Republican districts in the South. His victory was even more remarkable since six-term incumbent Jim Bunning made a successful run for the Senate in 1998, winning largely by carrying his old district by a margin that Democrat Scotty Baesler couldn&#x27;t make up in the rest of the state.

Lucas was reelected in 2000 by 12 points even as the district gave George W. Bush his largest victory margin in the state (the territory currently in the district has not supported a Democrat for President since 1964). He had a far closer race in 2002, when Geoff Davis held him to 51 percent.

Lucas opted not to seek reelection in 2004, having promised to serve only three terms (six years) in Congress. He heavily recruited Cincinnati television personality Nick Clooney to run against Davis in his stead, but Davis defeated Clooney 55% to 45%. A member of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Lucas and his wife Mary have five children.
==Run for Congress 2006==
Local and national Democratic Party leaders recruited Lucas to make a run for his old seat. He formally announced his candidacy on January 30.

Lucas&#x27; entry made the race competitive, despite the 4th&#x27;s Republican bent. Historically, among the Commonwealth&#x27;s districts, only the 5th district has been more Republican. The influence of the heavily Republican Cincinnati suburbs kept the district in Republican hands from 1967 until Lucas won the seat in 1998. In August &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot; rated the race as &quot;Lean Republican.&quot; In late July, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; also rated the race as a toss-up. A SurveyUSA poll released on July 25, 2006, showed Lucas leading 50% to 41%, although Davis has a decisive lead in fundraising.

Lucas ended up losing to Davis by nine points: 43% to 52%. To date, this is the last time that a Democrat has managed even 40 percent of the vote.

==A &quot;Blue-Dog&quot; Democrat==
Lucas was one of the most conservative Democrats in the House, as reflected by &quot;National Journal&quot; rankings. He had a lifetime American Conservative Union rating of 72, the highest of any Democrat in the 108th Congress. However, he shared most Democrats&#x27; wariness about privatizing Social Security. He was asked several times to switch parties and become a Republican, but rebuffed these overtures each time.

In a district with a strong social conservative bent, Lucas won his three terms by stressing his conservative social views. He is anti-abortion, pro-gun and against gay marriage. He supported President Bush&#x27;s tax cuts while in Congress and also voted in favor of going to war in Iraq. He identified as a &quot;Blue Dog Democrat.&quot; This comes from the old (Southern) phrase of &quot;Yellow dog Democrats&quot; — people who would vote Democrat even if a yellow dog was the nominee. To distance themselves from attacks (such as being too liberal), they formed the coalition.

<text>Anthony Louis Banks, Baron Stratford (8 April 1942 – 8 January 2006) was a British politician who served as Minister for Sport from 1997 to 1999. A member of the Labour Party, he was a member of Parliament from 1983 to 2005 and subsequently as a member of the House of Lords. He was well known in the House of Commons for his acid tongue.

==Career before politics==

Banks was born at the Jubilee Maternity Hospital, Belfast, the only son and elder child of Albert Herbert Banks, a sergeant in the Royal Army Service Corps who before the Second World War had been a toolmaker, and his wife, Olive Irene (Rene), &quot;née&quot; Rusca. The family returned to England after the birth, and he grew up in Brixton and Tooting. He was educated at St John&#x27;s School, Brixton, and Tenison&#x27;s School, Kennington. He failed his &quot;O&quot; Levels and left school to work as a clerk for a few years, but studied at night school to gain the qualifications necessary for university. From 1964 to 1967 he studied politics at the University of York, where he was President of the Student Representative Council. He graduated with an upper-second degree in 1967, then undertook further study at the London School of Economics.

Banks then became a trade union official, first for the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, from 1969 to 1975, then as Assistant General Secretary of the Association of Broadcasting Staff, from 1976 to 1983 (it later merged with other unions to form the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union or BECTU). For several years Banks was responsible for freelancers.

==Political career==
In 1964 Banks unsuccessfully stood for the Liberal Party in the first elections for the London Borough Councils that began operation in 1965. He later joined the Labour Party. He was a member of Lambeth Council from 1971 to 1974, and during the 1970s and 1980s he was a prominent member of the Greater London Council (GLC), representing Hammersmith (1970–1977) and Tooting (1981–1986). He was Chairman of the Greater London Council from 1985 until its abolition in 1986.

Having unsuccessfully contested East Grinstead in 1970, Newcastle upon Tyne North in October 1974 (by 469 votes), and Watford in 1979, Banks won Newham North West for Labour in 1983, defeating his predecessor, Arthur Lewis, who had been deselected as Labour&#x27;s candidate. Following a boundary review in 1995, Newham North West was expanded and renamed West Ham for the general election in 1997. Banks retained the seat until 2005, when he stood down.

===Ministerial post===
After Labour&#x27;s election victory in 1997 Banks was appointed Minister for Sport in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. He called for foreign players in the English Premiership to become eligible to play for England: &quot;Can you imagine seeing Cantona and Giggs swapping the Red of Manchester for the White of England?&quot; He also suggested that the football teams of the four constituent parts of the UK should merge to compete in the Olympic Games, as eventually occurred in 2012. However his calling for one UK football team in 1997 was met with ridicule from supporters and one colleague, the Scottish Labour MP Sam Galbraith, stated that the creation of such a team would only happen &quot;over his dead body&quot;. Banks also offended Scotland&#x27;s supporters by describing the team as the &quot;West Ham of world football - they never quite perform to their potential&quot;

Among Banks&#x27;s ministerial responsibilities were listed buildings, and he approved controversial additions including the 1930s Three Magpies pub in Birmingham and numerous redundant NHS buildings. He was also responsible for Grade I listing the Severn Bridge. He also controversially approved the demolition of the Twin Towers as part of the redevelopment of Wembley Stadium, dismissively referring to them as &quot;concrete blocks&quot;. 

After two years in office he stepped down to become the Prime Minister&#x27;s envoy for England&#x27;s bid to host the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The bid failed and Germany won instead. From then until his retirement from the Commons in 2005 Banks remained a backbencher, though he made a failed bid to become Labour&#x27;s candidate in the election for Mayor of London in 2004.

====Greater London Council elections====
==Political views==
Banks was a vegetarian, a supporter of animal rights and a Vice-President of the League Against Cruel Sports. He was regarded as on the left of Labour, being a republican, an opponent of the 2003 invasion of Iraq and a member of the Socialist Campaign Group. His only speeches regarding the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan involved requests for government money and the help of the Royal Navy for the animals of the Kabul Zoo, particularly for Marjan, an elderly lion that needed air-conditioning for its rheumatism.

On 21 May 2004 Banks proposed an Early Day Motion in response to newspaper reports that MI5 had proposed using pigeons as flying bombs during the Second World War. The motion condemned the proposal, described human beings as &quot;obscene, perverted, cruel, uncivilised and lethal&quot;, and proposed that the House &quot;looks forward to the day when the inevitable asteroid slams into the Earth and wipes them out, thus giving nature the opportunity to start again&quot;.

Banks was also a supporter of the arts and chaired the House of Commons Works of Art Committee, which had responsibility for historic paintings and sculptures in the Palace of Westminster.

==Outspoken behaviour==

In 1990, responding to a speech by the Conservative MP Terry Dicks opposing government funding for the arts, Banks said that Dicks was &quot;living proof that a pig&#x27;s bladder on a stick can get elected to Parliament&quot;. Banks also described another Conservative MP, Nicholas Soames, as &quot;a one-man food mountain&quot;. Banks referred to Canadians as &quot;dickheads&quot; for culling seals.

During a question on Basildon&#x27;s maternity services in 1994, Banks remarked that then Conservative MP for the area, David Amess had (as the father of five children) &quot;put far too much pressure on Basildon&#x27;s maternity services and suggested he use &quot;a do-it-yourself vasectomy kit with two bricks.&quot;

At the Labour Party conference in 1997 Banks described William Hague, then Leader of the Conservative Party, as a &quot;foetus&quot;, adding that Conservative MPs might be rethinking their views on abortion.

Banks crossed his fingers when he took the oath of allegiance to the Queen during a new session of Parliament. Banks said that he was wishing himself luck in his new job as Minister for Sport.

==Retirement==
On 23 November 2004, Banks announced that he would not stand at the next general election. Three days later, in an interview with Robin Oakley on BBC Radio 4, he said &quot;To be honest, I found it intellectually numbing and tedious in the extreme. I most certainly won&#x27;t miss the constituency work. I&#x27;ve got to tell you that honestly. It&#x27;s 22 years of the same cases, but just the faces and the people changing. It might sound a little disparaging to say this about people&#x27;s lives and their problems, and we did deal with them, ... but I got no satisfaction from this at all. I really didn&#x27;t. And all you were was a sort of high-powered social worker and perhaps not even a good one at that. I will miss being Chairman of the Works of Art Committee . . . because I was having so much intellectual enjoyment, and indeed just straightforward fun, out of reorganising our collection, and that kept me in touch with history&quot;.

On 24 March 2005 he made his final speech in the House of Commons. A week after the general election, on 13 May 2005, it was announced that he would be created a life peer, and on 23 June 2005 the peerage was gazetted as Baron Stratford, of Stratford in the London Borough of Newham.

==Personal life, death and legacy==
Banks was married to Sally Jones. He was a keen supporter of Chelsea F.C. and regularly attended matches. In 2003, when Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea FC, he expressed his disapproval, &quot;We need to look at the source of his money, what his track record has been in Russia, to establish whether he is a fit and proper person to take over a football club in this country.&quot; He was a member of the British Humanist Association.

On 7 January 2006, Banks was reported to have collapsed two days earlier after suffering a massive stroke while having lunch on Sanibel Island in Florida, where he was on holiday. He was flown by helicopter to a hospital in Fort Myers and died on 8 January without regaining consciousness. The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, described him as &quot;one of the most charismatic politicians in Britain, a true man of the people&quot;.

His funeral was held on 21 January at the City of London Crematorium: John Prescott, Tessa Jowell, Margaret Beckett, Alastair Campbell, Tony Benn, Chris Smith and Richard Caborn attended. Banks&#x27;s friend, former Conservative MP David Mellor, gave an address paying tribute. &quot;A lord of misrule, a cheeky chappy, call him what you will—he can be defined but he cannot be replaced,&quot; said Mellor.

Following her husband&#x27;s death, Lady Stratford vowed to continue his animal rights work, leading a campaign against the culling of seal pups in Canada. She is also a patron of the Captive Animals Protection Society, a charity campaigning for an end to the use of animals in circuses, zoos and the exotic pet trade.

==In popular culture==
&quot;The Wit and Wisdom of Tony Banks&quot;, edited by Iain Dale, was published in 1998.

His death on 8 January 2006 was referenced in the first series of &quot;The Ricky Gervais Show&quot; as part of Karl Pilkington&#x27;s diary of his holiday to Gran Canaria. Pilkington spoke of Banks&#x27; death: &quot;There was a piece on the news about how everyone was shocked&quot;.

An American singer-songwriter, Aimee Mann, became a close friend of Banks after meeting him in London in the early 1990s. The song &quot;You&#x27;re With Stupid Now&quot; on her 1995 album &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot; was inspired by their discussions of British politics.

<text>The Louisiana Holiday Trail of Lights is eight cities in north Louisiana (Shreveport, Bossier City, Minden, Monroe, West Monroe, Natchitoches and Alexandria, Pineville) that collectively offer festivals, parades, fireworks shows, shopping and dining in each of the cities starting the day after Thanksgiving through the New Year.

One of the most iconic festivals along the Louisiana Holiday Trail of Lights is the Natchitoches Christmas Festival, also called the &quot;Festival of Lights,&quot; in Natchitoches. It was started in 1927, making it one of the oldest light festivals in the US. In the largest north Louisiana city on the Trail, Shreveport offer Christmas in Roseland at the American Rose Center, Rockets Over the Red Fireworks, Christmas on Caddo Fireworks, nightly blizzards at the Louisiana Boardwalk Outlets and other events. Minden&#x27;s big holiday celebration is Fasching. Alexandria/Pineville offers WinterFete and Monroe-West Monroe is known for Antique Alley shopping.

All of the cities are within a one-hour drive of each other on Interstates 20 and 49.

<doc id="414443" wikidata="Q260562" url="?curid=414443" title="Greg Barker, Baron Barker of Battle">
<text>Gregory Leonard George Barker, Baron Barker of Battle, (born 8 March 1966) is a British Conservative Party politician and life peer. In May 2010 he was appointed Minister of State for Energy and Climate Change, a role in which he served until 2014. At the following year&#x27;s general election he stood down as MP for Bexhill and Battle and was appointed to the House of Lords.

==Early life and education==
Born in Sussex, Barker attended Upper Beeding Primary School, Steyning Grammar School and Lancing College. In 1987, he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history and politics from Royal Holloway College, London. In 1990–91, he attended a corporate finance programme at London Business School.

==Early career==
Barker was a researcher at the Centre for Policy Studies in 1987, before joining Gerard Vivian Gray as an equity analyst in 1988, and was a member of the Honourable Artillery Company between 1989 and 1994. In 1990, he became the director for International Pacific Securities. He was the deputy chairman of Hammersmith Conservative Association in 1993. From 1998, he was a director of Daric plc, an advertising company.

Barker also developed strong links to the Russian oil companies, being head of communications at the Anglo-Siberian Oil Company from 1998 to 2000 and also worked in London and Moscow for the Sibneft Oil Group, owned by Roman Abramovich.

==Career ==

=== House of Commons ===
Barker was at first unsuccessful in his attempts to be elected to Parliament when he contested the safe Labour seat of Eccles in Greater Manchester, where he was defeated by Ian Stewart. Barker then became the deputy chairman of Tooting Conservative Association and an advisor to Conservative MP David Willetts.

In 2001, Barker became the MP for Bexhill and Battle after the retirement of the sitting Conservative MP, Charles Wardle. Barker&#x27;s nomination by the Conservative Party was hotly debated when sitting MP and former Home Office minister Charles Wardle accused Barker of being disingenuous about his business career and after the election, formally requesting new Conservative Party Leader Iain Duncan Smith to investigate possible links between Barker and the infamous Russian billionaire Boris Berezovsky. Wardle supported Nigel Farage (who later became the Leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party), but Barker won the safe seat securing over 10,500 votes ahead of the Liberal Democrat candidate, Stephen Hardy.

Close to Conservative leader David Cameron, Barker, in his capacity as Shadow Environment Minister (which he served in from 2005 to 2008), accompanied Cameron on his trip to the Arctic Circle in April 2006 for a fact-finding mission about global warming.

In April 2011, Barker was filmed addressing an audience at the Moore School of Business at the University of South Carolina, during which he said of the Conservative-led British government: &quot;We are making cuts that Margaret Thatcher, back in the 1980s, could only have dreamed of.&quot;

Barker was implicated in the 2009 MPs&#x27; expenses scandal for his purchase and sale of London flats; this led to widespread outrage from tax payers.

On 5 February 2013 MP Gregory Barker voted in favour in the House of Commons Second Reading vote on marriage equality in Britain.

On 14 July 2014, he announced he would not be standing at the 2015 general election.

===House of Lords===
In August 2015, Barker was nominated for a life peerage in the Dissolution Peerages List. On 12 October 2015, he was created &quot;Baron Barker of Battle, of Battle in the County of East Sussex&quot;. On 10 November of that year, he was introduced to the Lords. He was supported during the ceremony by John Browne, Baron Browne of Madingley, and Guy Black, Baron Black of Brentwood.

In February 2019, Barker took a leave of absence from the House of Lords upon accepting an executive chairmanship position with the En+ Group. Barker was credited with having helped the Russian company to have the US sanctions lifted earlier that year, for which he was awarded a bonus of about £3-4 million (US$3.9-$5.2 million) that he described as &quot;relatively modest&quot;.

=== Business ===
Barker was appointed as Independent Chairman of the Board of Directors of En+ Group in October 2017, a company owned by the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, who sits on the U.S. sanctions list. In February 2019, he was appointed as Executive Chairman of the Board. In March 2022 he resigned as chairman of EN+. &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;The new company [a company En+ is considering setting up] would be owned by management and non-Russian investors, and potentially led by Barker, according to a report by Bloomberg News that was referenced by EN+. It would take on Rusal&#x27;s alumina, bauxite and aluminium assets across the world, including in Africa, Australia and Europe.&quot;

==Personal life==
Barker married Celeste Harrison, an heiress to the Charles Wells brewery fortune, in 1992. Following a diary report in &quot;The Observer&quot;, Barker confirmed he and his wife had separated, and on 26 October 2006 the tabloid newspaper the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; revealed that he had left his wife and children for vintage fashion expert William Banks-Blaney. The paper backed the story by quoting his mother-in-law.
&quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; later reported that Barker has confirmed that he is gay.

In 2009, Barker&#x27;s wealth was estimated at £3.9 million.

In May 2012, Barker attracted media attention, after it was reported he had used a staff microwave at the Department of Energy and Climate Change to warm a cushion for his pet dachshund, Otto.

<text>Harold Barnes (born 22 July 1936) is an English politician who was the Labour Party Member of Parliament for North East Derbyshire from 1987 to 2005.

==Life and career==

Born in Easington, County Durham, Barnes was educated at Ruskin College in Oxford and the University of Hull. He was elected to Parliament in the 1987 election. Barnes stood down at the May 2005 general election, and was succeeded by Natascha Engel.

===Political Positions===

Barnes was considered to be on the left of the party, and as a member of the Socialist Campaign Group (SCG) he voted against Tony Blair&#x27;s leadership on a number of issues. However, unlike other members of the SCG he was not an advocate of the Troops out movement (from Northern Ireland). When the group split over NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999, he supported intervention, which was the position of the government.

Before entering parliament, Barnes was a member of the Independent Labour Party&#x27;s successor organisation, Independent Labour Publications. As an MP, he joined a supporters group, Friends of the ILP.

<doc id="414448" wikidata="Q547153" url="?curid=414448" title="Hal Rogers">
<text>Harold Dallas Rogers (born December 31, 1937) is an American lawyer and politician serving his 23rd term as the U.S. representative for , having served since 1981. He is a member of the Republican Party. Upon Don Young&#x27;s death in 2022, Rogers became the dean of the House of Representatives.

Born in Barrier, Kentucky, Rogers graduated from the University of Kentucky with a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws degree. He entered private practice after serving in the National Guard for the states of Kentucky and North Carolina. In 1969, he became the commonwealth&#x27;s attorney for the counties of Pulaski and Rockcastle, an office he would hold until his election to Congress. In 1979 he was the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor.

After incumbent U.S. Representative Tim Lee Carter announced his retirement in 1980, Rogers launched a campaign for Kentucky&#x27;s 5th congressional district. He won the primary with a plurality of the vote and went on to easily win the general election. As his district is considered a Republican stronghold, Rogers has won reelection with over 65% of the vote in every election since 1980, with the sole exception of 1992.

==Early life and education==

Rogers was born in Barrier, Kentucky. After attending Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, he earned a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws from the University of Kentucky. Rogers served in the Kentucky Army National Guard and North Carolina Army National Guard.

== Early career ==
As a lawyer Rogers was in private practice and was elected to serve as commonwealth&#x27;s attorney for Pulaski and Rockcastle counties in Kentucky, an office he held from 1969 to his election to Congress in 1980.

Rogers was the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor of Kentucky in 1979. He was on the ballot with former Governor Louie B. Nunn. He lost to Democratic nominee John Y. Brown Jr. 59%–41%. The following year, Rogers won election to Congress.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===

In 1980, incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Tim Lee Carter of Kentucky&#x27;s 5th congressional district decided to retire. Rogers won the Republican primary with a plurality of 23 percent. The losing candidates included the 1971 gubernatorial nominee, Tom Emberton. He won the general election with 67% of the vote. He has won reelection with at least 65% of the vote since then, except in 1992, when he defeated Democratic candidate John Doug Hays, a former member of the Kentucky State Senate with 55% of the vote to Hays&#x27; 45% of the vote.

===Tenure===
Rogers is the longest-serving Kentucky Republican ever elected to federal office. He represents one of the few ancestrally Republican districts south of the Ohio River. South-central Kentucky, historically the heart of the district, is very similar demographically to East Tennessee. Its voters identified with the Republicans after the Civil War and have supported the GOP ever since. Rogers served as a delegate to nine Republican National Conventions from 1976 to 2008.

The Center for Rural Development––a 501c(3) nonprofit organization established in Somerset, Kentucky, in March 1996––was Rogers&#x27;s idea.

In 2001 the City of Williamsburg, Kentucky named their new water park and miniature golf facility the Hal Rogers Family Entertainment Center as a &quot;thank-you for the federal money he has brought back to Whitley County, the City of Williamsburg, and the other 40 counties he represents&quot;.

On the House/Senate conference decision to bolster the Department of Commerce and support the Clinton Administration priorities, President Clinton remarked, &quot;I commend the congressional leadership, Senator Ernest Hollings, Senator Pete Domenici, Congressman Neal Smith, and Congressman Harold Rogers, for their foresight and support in revitalizing this country through these programs. It is a dramatic step forward for the United States toward a solid economic future.&quot;

Kentucky state biographer Amy Witherbee commented: &quot;Rogers&#x27;s multiple roles on the Appropriations Committee have honed his skills as a bipartisan negotiator, and his economically challenged district often prompts him to stray from hard-line conservative stances. Although voting with his party against raising environmental standards on sports utility vehicles and against a controversial amendment that would have prohibited oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Rogers has been the creator and leading proponent of large environmental protection and clean-up programs throughout the Appalachian region... [His] reluctance to involve the federal government in local issues has not deterred him from supporting a multitude of economic development programs aimed at creating new job bases in economically disadvantaged areas, and particularly in Appalachia. In 1993, Rogers was one of only three Republicans to vote for then-President Bill Clinton&#x27;s economic stimulus package. In March 2003, Rogers&#x27;s ability to work through the bipartisan tangles of the Appropriations Committee won him the chairmanship on the subcommittee designated to control funding for the new Department of Homeland Security.&quot;

Ready evidence is found on March 20, 2008, when the invitation to testify in support of environmental legislation by Democratic House Majority Leader Rocky Adkins, and, on the same day, a rare invitation to speak from the Senate floor was afforded by Republican Senate Majority Leader Senator David L. Williams of Cumberland County as part of the Senate&#x27;s unanimously passed bipartisan resolution honoring Rogers for his service.

Rogers called a bill to reduce funding for law enforcement &quot;the result of this new Republican majority&#x27;s commitment to bring about real change in the way Washington spends the people&#x27;s money&quot;.

In 2011 Rogers voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which included a controversial provision that allowed the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.

In December 2017 Rogers voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

Rogers, along with all other congressional Republicans, voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

Following Grace Napolitano&#x27;s retirement in 2024, Rogers became the oldest voting member of the House (Washington, D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who cannot vote on the House floor, is older).

===Criticism===

Rogers has been widely criticized by both liberal and conservative pundits for his priorities when it comes to national security. &quot;National Review&quot; called him &quot;a national disgrace&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named him one of America&#x27;s &quot;Ten Worst Congressmen&quot;, calling him &quot;Bin Laden&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; for steering federal homeland security money away from large cities to his home district, which critics claim is one of the least likely terrorist targets in America because of its lack of any notable monuments or population centers. In 2007 Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Rogers to its list of the Most Corrupt Members of Congress.

On May 14, 2006, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that Rogers had used his legislative position, as chair of the House subcommittee that controls the Homeland Security budget, to create &quot;jobs in his home district and profits for companies that are donors to his political causes&quot;.
The &quot;Lexington Herald-Leader&quot; in 2005 called Rogers the &quot;Prince of Pork&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; article reported that Rogers had inserted language (&quot;existing government card issuance centers&quot;) into appropriations bills that effectively pushed the federal government into testingat a cost of $4millionolder, inappropriate technology for a new fraud-resistant green card for permanent legal immigrants, at a production plant in Corbin, Kentucky, within Rogers&#x27;s district. The study concluded that the smart card approach was far superior. The &quot;New York Times&quot; found that Rogers had received about $100,000 in contributions from parties with at least some ties to the identification card effort.

In response to these critics, Rogers said, &quot;It should surprise no one that this article from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; regarding my activity in connection with the Transportation Worker Identity Card (TWIC) is grossly incorrect, and highly slanderous ... A true and honest analysis would reveal that my sole interest in TWIC is simply to protect America&#x27;s seaports, airports, and other transportation facilities from terrorist penetration. To purport that my actions have compromised national security in an effort to bring jobs to Kentucky or for personal gain is an absolute lie.&quot;

After Iran objected to the interim deployment of an Afloat Forward Staging Base to counter their threats to close the Persian Gulf, Rogers cut the funding for the project.

Rogers faced some criticism after he reportedly poked his colleague and Congressional Black Caucus Chair Joyce Beatty in the back and told her to &quot;kiss my ass&quot; after she asked him to put on a mask, as required on the United States Capitol subway system where the incident occurred. Rogers soon issued an apology to Beatty.

===MilCon/VA Bill===

On June 12, 2013, the White House threatened to veto the MilCon/VA spending bill because Republicans did not agree with the Senate&#x27;s number of $1.058trillion intended for military operations and research, after the MilCon/VA bill received 421 bipartisan votes in House. &quot;We&#x27;re marking up to $967billion, the top line under current law,&quot; said Rogers, as chair of United States House Committee on Appropriations.

===Legislation===

On January 15, 2013, Rogers introduced H.R. 298, officially titled &quot;To direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study to evaluate the significance of the Mill Springs Battlefield located in Pulaski and Wayne Counties, Kentucky, and the feasibility of its inclusion in the National Park System, and for other purposes&quot;. The bill would direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study to evaluate the significance of the Mill Springs Battlefield in Kentucky (relating to the Battle of Mill Springs fought on January 19, 1862, in Pulaski and Wayne Counties during the Civil War) and the feasibility of its inclusion in the National Park System (NPS). Rogers said, &quot;the Battle of Mill Springs is a source of great pride and interest to the people I serve.&quot; Rogers argued that the Battlefield was a &quot;jewel&quot; and would be &quot;an excellent addition to the National Park Service&quot;.

On March 5, 2014, Rogers introduced the To provide for the costs of loan guarantees for Ukraine (H.R. 4152; 113th Congress) into the House. The bill would provide loan guarantees to Ukraine of up to $1billion, part of the American response to the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine. The bill passed in the House on March 6, 2014.

In 2014 Rogers&#x27;s committee called for cuts in the National Nuclear Security Administration budget that cast doubt on the Navy&#x27;s ability to provide an Ohio Replacement Submarine class.

On July 29, 2014, Rogers introduced the Making supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014 (H.R. 5230; 113th Congress), a bill that would provide supplemental FY2014 appropriations to several federal agencies for expenses related to the rise in unaccompanied alien children and alien adults accompanied by an alien minor at the southwest border. The bill would also change the procedures for screening and processing unaccompanied alien children who arrive at the border from certain countries. The bill would provide $659million in supplemental funding. Rogers urged members to pass the bill, arguing that &quot;more and more immigrants will continue to flood across the border if you fail to act&quot; because resources were running out.

===Committee assignments===
For the 118th Congress:
* Committee on Appropriations
** Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (Chair)

==Political positions==

Throughout his congressional tenure, Rogers has sometimes been regarded as a bipartisan negotiator, although his views are staunchly conservative. He is anti-abortion, scoring a 100 percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee, opposes LGBT rights, and supports a balanced budget amendment for the United States. Nonetheless, a FiveThirtyEight analysis of the voting records of members of the 118th Congress deemed him a moderate Republican, indicating unusually high support for bipartisan spending legislation and unusually low support for Republican &quot;messaging&quot; amendments. Currently in his 22nd term in Congress, Rogers is the longest-serving Republican from Kentucky ever elected to federal office.

===Budget and economy===
Rogers is in favor of dismantling the Home Affordable Modification Program. He opposed the GM and Chrysler bailout in 2009. He opposes regulating the subprime mortgage industry. He supports a balanced budget amendment.

===Domestic issues===
====Gun control====

In 2018, Rogers co-sponsored a bill to &quot;strengthen school safety and security&quot;, which required a two-thirds vote for passage, given it was brought up under an expedited process. The House voted 407–10 to approve the bill, which would &quot;provide $50million a year for a new federal grant program to train students, teachers and law enforcement on how to spot and report signs of gun violence&quot;. Named STOP (Students, Teachers, and Officers Preventing) School Violence Act, it would &quot;develop anonymous telephone and online systems where people could report threats of violence&quot;. At the same time, it would authorize $25 million for schools to improve and harden their security, such as installing new locks, lights, metal detectors and panic buttons. A separate spending bill would be required to provide money for the grant program.

====Crime====

Rogers supports expanding the juvenile justice system, including renovating and hiring additional prosecutors. Rogers supports the death penalty.

====Environment====

Rogers has a 13 percent rating from the Humane Society for his anti-animal welfare voting record.

The U.S. intelligence community had concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and that it was continuing to interfere in election systems as of July 2018.

===Social issues===
====Abortion====

Rogers is anti-abortion. He has a 100 percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee and a zero percent rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America for his abortion-related voting record. He is in favor of banning federal funding from supporting organizations that provide abortions, as well as federal health insurance covering abortions, unless the pregnancy is the result of rape, incest, or threatens the mother&#x27;s life. He opposes embryonic stem cell research. He opposes human cloning.

====Cannabis====

Rogers has a &quot;D&quot; rating from NORML for his voting history regarding cannabis-related causes. Rogers opposes veterans having access to medical marijuana if recommended by their Veterans Health Administration doctor and if it is legal for medicinal purposes in their state of residence.

====Civil rights====

Rogers has a 28 percent rating from the NAACP for his civil rights voting record. He opposes affirmative action.

====LGBT rights====

Rogers has a 92 percent rating from the Christian Coalition for his socially conservative voting record. He has a zero percent rating from the Human Rights Campaign regarding his voting record on LGBT rights. Rogers opposes same-sex marriage. He opposes prohibiting job discrimination based on sexual orientation. He opposes single people and same-sex couples being allowed to adopt children. Rogers opposes classifying crimes motivated by the victim&#x27;s sexual orientation as hate crimes.

==Personal life==

Rogers had three children with his first wife, Shirley Rogers. She died of cancer in 1995. Rogers remarried. His current wife is Cynthia Doyle.

In January 2024, Rogers was involved in a car crash in the Washington, D.C., area. According to a statement released by his office, he was in &quot;good condition” after he was admitted to a nearby hospital. By the next month, Rogers was expected to return to Capitol Hill and resume his duties.

<doc id="414450" wikidata="Q337720" url="?curid=414450" title="John Baron (politician)">
<text>John Charles Baron (born 21 June 1959) is a British Conservative Party politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Basildon and Billericay, previously Billericay, from 2001 to 2024. He has frequently rebelled against his party, specifically in his calling for a referendum on the European Union (EU) before the 2015 election and in opposing military intervention in Iraq, Libya, and Syria.

Baron is a strong critic of the EU; he was a vocal supporter of Brexit during the 2016 EU referendum. He later supported the pro-Brexit campaign Leave Means Leave campaign.

Baron stepped down after 23 years as an MP at the 2024 general election, despite being reselected by the local Conservative association.

==Early life and education==
John Baron was born in Redhill, Surrey, and was privately educated at the Queen&#x27;s College, Taunton, followed by studies at Jesus College, Cambridge and at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

==Career==
===Military service===
After university, Baron was accepted into the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers on 3 January 1984 as a second lieutenant (on probation). He was commissioned and promoted to lieutenant with seniority from 8 August 1984. He was promoted to captain on 8 February 1987. He served in Northern Ireland, Cyprus and Germany.

On 3 January 1988, he transferred to the Regular Army Reserve of Officers. This signalled the end of his military career, but he remained liable to call up. He resigned his commission on 1 June 1997.

===Banking career===
In 1987, he became a merchant banker: working as a fund manager then director of Henderson Private Investors Ltd (later Henderson Global Investors) and Rothschild Asset Management.

===Political career===
In 1995, Baron became the treasurer of the Streatham Conservative Association. 

In 1997 David Amess decided not to risk standing again in his ultra-marginal Conservative seat of Basildon and was elected for the safer seat of Southend West. Baron was selected as the Conservative in Basildon. At the 1997 general election, Baron came second with 30.8% of the vote behind the Labour candidate Angela Smith.

== Parliamentary career ==
In November 1999, Teresa Gorman announced intention to stand down at the next general election from Billericay. Baron was selected to defend Billericay at the 2001 general election, when he was elected as MP for Billericay with 47.4% of the vote and a majority of 5,013. He made his maiden speech on 20 July 2001.

Baron was a member of Iain Duncan Smith&#x27;s frontbench team, but resigned in March 2003 in protest at his support of the Iraq War. He was re-appointed by Duncan Smith as a health spokesman four months later, a position he held until July 2007 when he was moved to the Conservative Whip&#x27;s Office.

At the 2005 general election, Baron was re-elected as MP for Billericay with an increased vote share of 52.2% and an increased majority of 11,206.

Baron was a strong backer of David Davis in the 2005 Conservative leadership election, having also supported him in the 2001 leadership contest won by Iain Duncan Smith.

Prior to the 2010 general election, Baron&#x27;s constituency of Billericay was abolished, and was replaced by Basildon and Billericay. At the general election, Baron was elected as MP for Basildon and Billericay with 52.8% of the vote and a majority of 12,338.

Baron was the only Conservative among just 15 MPs who voted against British participation in the attack on Libya in the Commons on 21 March 2011. In 2013 he tabled a backbench motion to mandate a vote in Parliament before providing &quot;lethal support&quot; to anti-government forces in Syria, which ultimately prevented further military intervention when the government was unable to secure the necessary parliamentary support and he was also part of a minority voting against the government on air strikes against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

In June 2012, Baron delivered a letter, signed by over 100 Tory MPs, to the Prime Minister David Cameron urging him &quot;to place on the Statute Book before the next General Election a commitment to hold a referendum during the next Parliament on the nature of our relationship with the European Union&quot;. In May 2013 he tabled a rebel amendment to the Queen&#x27;s Speech to &quot;express regret&quot; that a referendum on the EU could not be held sooner, which was backed by over 100 MPs.

His reputation as a Eurosceptic and &quot;serial rebel&quot; saw his name mentioned as a possible defector to the UK Independence Party. Speaking to the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; in response to speculation in late 2014, Baron said: &quot;You should never say never in politics, but the bottom line is my very strong preference is to stay within the Conservative party.&quot;

In July 2014, Mark d&#x27;Arcy of the BBC named Baron his choice in &quot;Parliamentarians of the Year&quot; for 2013/14 for his role in opposing military action in Syria and seeking a promise of a referendum on membership of the European Union, writing that &quot;he is not a household name or a fiery orator, but his fingerprints are all over the two most significant parliamentary events of the last 12 months.&quot; 

At the 2015 general election, Baron was re-elected as MP for Basildon and Billericay with a decreased vote share of 52.7% and an increased majority of 12,482.

In December 2015 he voted against further airstrikes in Syria.

He was again re-elected at the snap 2017 general election, with an increased vote share of 61% and an increased majority of 13,400. At the 2019 general election he was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 67.1% and an increased majority of 20,412.

Following the publication of the Sue Gray Report, Baron withdrew support for prime minister Boris Johnson calling for his resignation stating, “I&#x27;m afraid the Prime Minister no longer enjoys my support”.

Baron was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2023 Birthday Honours for political and public service.

==Personal life==
Baron is married and has two daughters.

<text>Christopher Nigel Beard (10 October 1936 – 31 July 2017) was a British Labour politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bexleyheath and Crayford in London from 1997 to 2005.

He previously contested several parliamentary constituencies: Woking at the 1979 general election, Portsmouth North at the 1983 general election and Erith and Crayford at the 1992 general election. At the 1997 general election, he was returned as MP for Bexleyheath and Crayford. Before this, he had been senior research manager for ICI and Zeneca. He retained the seat at the 2001 election but lost it in the 2005 election to David Evennett of the Conservative Party.

Beard was a loyal follower of the Labour whip, voting for the Iraq War and other government policies. He also introduced a Private Member&#x27;s Bill to fix British Summer Time as standard time all year round. He died at the age of 80 in Surrey after a long illness.
