<text>The Border Conference, officially known as the Border Intercollegiate Athletic Association, was an NCAA-affiliated college athletic conference founded in 1931 that disbanded following the 1961–62 school year. Centered in the southwestern United States, the conference included nine member institutions located in the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.

==History==
===Chronological timeline===

* Hardin–Simmons University – American Southwest Conference (Division III) 
* University of New Mexico – Mountain West Conference
* New Mexico State University – Conference USA
* Northern Arizona University – Big Sky Conference (Division I FCS)
* University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) – Conference USA
* Texas Tech University – Big 12 Conference
* West Texas A&amp;M University – Lone Star Conference (Division II)

==Football champions==
Texas Tech holds the most conference championships at seven. Arizona State won six conference championships followed by Arizona (three), Hardin–Simmons (two) and both West Texas State and the Texas State School of Mines hold one each. From 1932 to 1934 and 1943 to 1945 no champion was named. There were only two seasons where the title was split and two co-champions were named; 1938, New Mexico and New Mexico A&amp;M and in 1942 Hardin–Simmons and Texas Tech. The winner of the conference title generally received an invitation to serve as the host team for the Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas.

<text>Yahoo Widgets is a discontinued free application platform for Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows, specifically Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7. The software was previously called Konfabulator, but after being acquired by computer services company Yahoo on July 25, 2005, it was rebranded. The name Konfabulator was subsequently reinstated as the name of the underlying rendering engine. The engine uses a JavaScript runtime environment combined with an XML interpreter to run small applications referred to as widgets, and hence is part of a class of software applications called widget engines. On February 27, 2012, Yahoo updated the License agreement stating that as of April 3, 2012 Yahoo! Widgets will continue to be available for download but support and development would stop.

==Features==
Yahoo Widget Engine includes some default widgets to get users started, including a weather widget, a digital clock, and a calendar among other things. Some of the most downloaded ones include a world time zone clock, dedicated countdown timers, simple RSS feed readers, and webcam viewers.

Each widget runs in its own system process, separate from other types of widgets and the main Konfabulator system process itself, thus improving the stability of the software application as a whole. Should a problem occur with a Konfabulator widget requiring it to be shut down, that particular widget can be shut down without affecting other widgets or the main Konfabulator application. A disadvantage of doing this was the computer memory needed for each process to run, which was possibly a potential problem on the computers of the time that were typically equipped with only 512mb-2gb RAM. This was a minor issue compared to the RAM consumed by the graphical nature of the widgets which could make them more RAM intensive than traditional square shaped desktop apps.

===Heads-up display/Konsposé===

Yahoo Widgets provides a feature that can quickly bring all open widgets to the top of the desktop. It can be activated by pressing a hotkey (set by the user). This causes all widgets to be brought to the foreground, and all other applications to be dimmed. Widgets can also be set to be Konsposé-only, meaning that they will only appear when Konsposé is activated. Initially called Konsposé (alluding to Mac OS X&#x27;s Exposé), it was renamed to &quot;Heads-Up Display&quot; with the release of Yahoo Widget Engine.

===(The) Dock===

With the introduction of Yahoo Widget Engine 4.0, the engine has included a feature called the dock. The dock shows all widgets with representative icons. Widgets that do not specify images are either provided with their screen-shot from the official widget gallery or the default widget icon, both shown on the right. When rolled over with the mouse, the dock helps users manage their widgets with buttons to close a widget, show a widget&#x27;s preferences, and reveal a widget from the head-up display. For users who prefer not to have a dock visible all the time, the dock has options to auto-hide when not active, or even close entirely.

===Developer/API features===
The Yahoo Widget Engine (Konfabulator) has a very flexible application programming interface (API) based on JavaScript with many features useful to developers. A few basic features include items such as text-areas, images, and timers. Other features include the ability to download webpages from the Internet, as well as file input/output, and animator objects to aid in visual effects. A built in interface allows widget developers to run OS specific code such as shell scripts and COM applications on Windows, and AppleScript on Mac.

As of Yahoo Widget Engine 4.0, SQLite has been included in the engine, allowing developers to create and modify databases. Also included with 4.0 is the Canvas class, which allows vector drawing. Canvas &quot;images&quot; can be saved to either a JPG or PNG image file. With the introduction of the dock, widgets can set their own dock icons. Dock icons support a small subset of the engine&#x27;s features, so they have the ability to display multiple images and text. This is useful to widgets designed to be such things as a clock, or a weather forecaster. Also added to text objects is support for simple CSS styles for formatting. Another new feature included in version 4.0 is the ability to automatically check gallery downloaded widgets for updates. Previously only available to official Yahoo Widgets, this feature was enabled for all third-party widget authors on August 17, 2007.

Yahoo Widgets 4.5, released on November 29, 2007, introduced support for both WebKit and Adobe Flash, allowing development of widgets using XML, HTML and JavaScript as well as the capabilities of Flash. The WebKit support does not include plugins, so Flash is supported through the use of a separate native object.

==History==
===Initial development===
Yahoo Widgets was originally developed as Konfabulator, by a core development team at software firm Pixoria consisting of Arlo Rose, Perry Clarke, and Ed Voas. Originally released on February 10, 2003, as a Mac OS X only application which cost $24.95 (and later, with the release of version 2.0, US$19.95), its Windows version was released on November 8, 2004, with the release of version Konfabulator 1.8, and made freeware with the release of Konfabulator 2.1 on July 25, 2005, when Pixoria was sold to Yahoo. Shortly prior to this, Apple released a similar widget engine, Dashboard, as part of its Mac OS X Tiger operating system. Konfabulator&#x27;s main commercial competitor on the Windows platform is DesktopX, developed by Stardock. Other programs offering similar functionality include Kapsules and AveDesk (for Windows), gDesklets (for GNOME), and SuperKaramba (for KDE).

The JavaScript engine used by Konfabulator uses the Mozilla SpiderMonkey implementation, and conforms to the Mozilla JavaScript version 1.5 standards (equivalent to ECMAScript 262 edition 3, with Mozilla extensions).

The idea of Konfabulator originated in 1998, when Arlo Rose saw how he could skin the MP3 media player running on his computer. His idea was to &quot;skin any information you wanted to see on your desktop.&quot;

Prior to this, he had experience with Kaleidoscope, a skinning program for the Apple Macintosh operating systems, akin to WindowBlinds. He coined the term &quot;Konfabulator&quot; to describe his idea, and then tried pitching his idea to other software programmers. He was unsuccessful until the year 2002, when Perry Clarke (who would later become one of the core developers of Konfabulator) heard about his idea and agreed to work with him on the project.

On February 10, 2003, Rose and Clarke launched version 1.0 of Konfabulator. Before the launch, Rose created a teaser web site asking visitors what Konfabulator is, while it was still in development. When it was finally released, users of Konfabulator were highly impressed with the idea of widgets, and its popularity soared as a result, something which surprised the developers of Konfabulator. Due to its popularity, Rose and Clarke had to quit their jobs to work on Konfabulator full-time.

In July 2003, Rose and Clarke started working on a Windows version with another software programmer, but internal differences broke them up and they were forced to scrap the work already done. Later, Rose persuaded Ed Voas (who was then a friend of Rose and had 10 years of software programming experience at Apple Computer, and would later become the third member of Konfabulator&#x27;s core development team) to develop a Windows version for them. Initially he declined, but later he created a working prototype and presented it to the Konfabulator development team within two days.

In November 2004, Konfabulator 1.8, the first cross-platform version of Konfabulator, was released. The Windows version was capable of seamlessly running most Konfabulator widgets written for the Mac OS X operating system on Windows machines, and vice versa. Some widgets developed later were, however, platform-specific.

A few months later, on May 18, 2005, the first major release of Konfabulator since version 1.0, Konfabulator 2.0 (sometimes shortened to &quot;K:2&quot;), was released, along with a visual overhaul of widgets, improved functionality, and a marked down price of US$19.95 from the previous US$24.95 (this was after many users, especially Windows users used to the idea of freeware and other cheaper widget engines, complained about the high price). The popularity of Konfabulator accelerated soon after that, and companies were seeking to use Konfabulator in their projects. In response to the demand for Konfabulator, and to provide a proper information source for widget developers (some of whom were scraping web sites for information for their widgets), the Konfabulator development team decided to sell Konfabulator to Yahoo.

===Acquisition of Konfabulator===
On July 25, 2005, Konfabulator was acquired by Yahoo, and Yahoo released Konfabulator for free. While the Konfabulator framework was renamed Yahoo Widgets, the underlying engine continued to be branded as Konfabulator until December 2005.

Yahoo said the reason they purchased Konfabulator was that they wanted an easy way to open up its APIs to the widget developer community and allow them easy access to the information on the Yahoo Web site. In doing this, widgets could be built without having to scrape or search web sites in order to get information regarding the APIs for widgets and the Konfabulator framework.

On May 23, 2006, the Universal binary of the Yahoo Widget Engine, version 3.1.4, was made available to users of Intel-based Macintosh computers.

In August 2006, Perry Clarke, the original engineer of the Mac version of the widget engine, left the Yahoo Widgets team, followed later by Arlo Rose himself. In August 2008, Ed Voas, who developed the first Windows version of Konfabulator, also left the team.

===Closure===
On March 2, 2012, it was announced that Yahoo would be closing down support for the Yahoo Widget Engine and closing the Yahoo Widget Gallery altogether. The announcement was made on the front page of the Yahoo gallery and on the Konfabulator forum . Yahoo claimed that the reason for closure was twofold - the cost of replacing the older servers that supported the gallery and the refocussing of human resources on the development of the Yahoo! Connected TV widget platform.

===Current technical status===
Windows – The Yahoo Widget engine operates on Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, 8 and 10. On XP the widget has full functionality. On NT6 systems (Vista +) the sound control functionality is limited as Windows UAC does not give widget apps the right to modify the system sound control without administrator access, all other functions operate as designed.

Mac OSX – As of 10.11 El Capitan, the Yahoo widget dock no longer functions correctly. However, the dock can be disabled by editing the relevant .plist configuration file and the widgets then become accessible via the menu. Despite this relatively minor limitation, the widgets still operate as expected in previous versions of OSX.

Linux – The Yahoo widget engine was ported to Ubuntu Linux 10.10 and modified to become the Yahoo! Connected TV engine. The linux version is not designed as a standalone widget engine for running widgets on desktop Linux but instead uses Ubuntu as the host for an embedded o/s in television sets. However, it is possible to run Ubuntu linux 10.10 on a normal PC and run the Yahoo! Connected TV engine locally for development/testing purposes.

On March 30, 2018 - fifteen years after Konfabulator debuted, Yahoo (now under Verizon ownership) stopped allowing &quot;Kon&quot; apps to be published to the Yahoo! Connected TV engine, encouraging developers instead to offer HTML5 connector apps. This marks the final discontinuation of the last continuing branch of Konfabulator.

===Disruption of the weather widget feed===
As of May 2016 the popular Yahoo weather widget has stopped functioning. The weather widget was one of Yahoo&#x27;s most popular widgets as it provided free access to Yahoo&#x27;s weather feed. Yahoo has modified the manner in which the weather feed is accessed breaking not only the weather widget but all others programs and sites that attempt to use it. Yahoo&#x27;s updated documentation stated: &quot;To increase the security measure and better serving our YDN customers, weather data source will enforce OAuth 1 starting March 15, 2016. Please update your API calls with OAuth 1 enabled (via the OAuth /v1/yql end point if using YQL) using your Yahoo App key and secret.&quot;

As the weather widget is no longer supported, changes to fix the widget will not be carried out by Yahoo employees. However, as all widgets can be decompiled to their original JavaScript source code, the widget could be modified by developers to correspond to Yahoo&#x27;s modified authorisation requirements or to obtain the data from an alternate weather source. Other widgets have been modified in this manner and already obtain the source data from such alternative feeds as https://aviationweather.gov/adds/dataserver.

<text>John Andrew Barrett (born 11 February 1954) is a Scottish Liberal Democrat politician and the former Member of Parliament (MP) for Edinburgh West.

==Background and early career==
Barrett was born in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. 

John Barrett was educated at the Forrester High School in Edinburgh, Telford College and Napier Polytechnic (Now Napier University). He also attended Cornell University (New York State) summer sessions in Development Communication and returned to Cornell as a teaching assistant.

He joined the Scottish Liberal Party in 1980 and was the election agent for Veronica Crerar when she won the South East Corstorphine ward in 1984. He was also the election agent at council and parliamentary elections for Donald Gorrie. John Barrett was elected to the City of Edinburgh Council for South-East Corstorphine ward in 1995 and was elected Chairman of the Liberal Democrat Group from 1995 to 2001. He was the election agent for Donald Gorrie in Edinburgh West when the Liberal Democrats won the seat from the Conservatives at the 1997 General Election.

He married Carol , a graduate of Edinburgh College of Art and well known wildlife artist. They have one daughter, Sarah, and two granddaughters, Maria and Hope. They live in Edinburgh.

==Parliamentary career==
In 2000, Donald Gorrie decided to stand down from House of Commons to concentrate on the Scottish Parliament. John Barrett won the nomination to defend Edinburgh West at the 2001 general election, which he did by 7,589 votes. He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 13 July 2001. John Barrett sat on the International Development Select Committee between 2001 and 2007, and was made a party spokesman on International Development in 2003. He was promoted by Charles Kennedy in December 2005 to Shadow Minister of State for Scotland, while continuing as a spokesman on International Development. Since 2008 he has also been a spokesman on Work and Pensions with a focus on disability issues.

Barrett has fought prominent campaigns; for Trade Justice, against Post Office closures, opposing the war in Iraq, supporting renewables and opposing nuclear power, against the replacement of Trident and for a number of animal welfare issues alongside the Scottish SPCA, including one to ban the trade in cat and dog fur.

Following the boundary changes in 2005, Edinburgh West now included the areas of Stenhouse and Murrayfield. He was re-elected in the 2005 United Kingdom general election, with a majority of 13,600 over the nearest (Conservative) candidate, making Edinburgh West the second safest Lib-Dem seat in the UK, a seat which the Lib Dems had won for the first time only eight years before.

Barrett is a founding member of the Beveridge Group within the Liberal Democrats. He is also the President of the Scottish Liberal Club, serves on the Scottish and Federal Liberal Democrat national executive committees, is leading the party&#x27;s legacy programme in Scotland and continues to campaign for the Liberal Democrats.

Outside politics he is a director of ABC Productions and worked with Atlantic Screen Music. He was involved with a number of charities working in the developing world – including India 800 and as an ambassador for CBM UK. He trained parliamentarians in emerging democracies with the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, was on the Advisory Council of the Edinburgh International Film Festival and was also a member of the Royal Bank of Scotland&#x27;s Microfinance Advisory Board.

On 25 July 2009, Barrett announced that he would be standing down from Parliament at the 2010 general election. In only two seats in the UK, Edinburgh West and Cambridge, were retiring Liberal Democrats able to successfully see their own party hold on to their seats. He was succeeded as MP for Edinburgh West by fellow Liberal Democrat Mike Crockart.

==Since leaving Parliament==

In an article in January 2014, Barrett condemned the policies of the Liberal Democrats in coalition with the Tories at Westminster, saying &quot;No wonder the public in Scotland drifted away in large numbers from the party at both the last set of Holyrood and council elections.&quot;

He is no longer actively involved in party politics but continues to support a number of causes and contributes to the debate on issues he supports. He has organised a number of fundraising concerts to support a range of local, national and international issues, such as the funding of a local youth and community centre, supporting a number of cancer charities and funding support for families in Ukraine following the Russian invasion in February 2022. He is also a published author of a work of fiction, The Mayor of Kalymnos.

<text>Sir Kevin John Barron (born 26 October 1946) is a British Labour Party politician and former coal industry worker. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Rother Valley from 1983 until 2019.

==Early life==
Kevin John Barron, the son of Richard and Edna Barron, was born on 26 October 1946 at Hazlewood Castle, Tadcaster, Yorkshire, and educated at Maltby Hall Secondary Modern School, Ruskin College, and the University of Sheffield, where he earned a Diploma in Labour Studies in 1977, and was reportedly a member of Militant.

On leaving school in 1962, Barron became an electrician at the Maltby colliery. He spent the next 23 years working in the coal industry. In 1982, he became president of the Rotherham Trades Union Congress. He was a member of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), which later expelled him for speaking out against Arthur Scargill. Once, on picketing duty outside Maltby colliery, he was struck on the arm by a police baton. He successfully sued South Yorkshire Police for this. He was a political ally of Arthur Scargill.

==Parliamentary career==
In 1983 Peter Hardy, Labour MP for Rother Valley, decided to switch constituencies to fight the equally safe neighbouring new seat of Wentworth. With NUM backing, Barron secured the nomination, and was duly elected as the Labour MP for Rother Valley at the 1983 general election.

In 1985, Barron was made a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition Neil Kinnock, a position he held until the 1988 election. Kinnock gave Barron a frontbench job in 1988 as an opposition spokesman on Energy. He lost this position when John Smith took over the leadership and he refused another front bench position. Barron was returned to the front bench nine months later as a spokesman on Employment by the new leader John Smith, and following Smith&#x27;s death Tony Blair moved Barron to speak on Health matters. 

Barron was a leading figure in the campaign to rewrite Clause IV under the new leadership of Tony Blair, and it came as a surprise that there was no job in government for him after the victorious 1997 general election. He served for eight years on the senior Intelligence and Security Committee and was made a Privy Councillor in 2001. He was made Chairman of the influential Health Select Committee following the 2005 general election.

Barron has been a Member of the General Medical Council since 1999, and is passionately anti-smoking.

Following the MP&#x27;s expenses row, Barron placed his expenses claims cover sheets in the window of his constituency office in Laughton Road, Dinnington. In the review of Past Additional Cost Allowance by Sir Thomas Legg QC, Barron was found to have no issues and was not required to repay any monies. In May 2010, Barron was returned to Westminster as the MP for Rother Valley with a severely reduced majority. In July 2010, he was appointed chair of the parliamentary Standards and Privileges Committee and was returned unopposed to that post after the 2015 general election.

Barron was knighted in the 2014 New Year Honours for political and public service.

In 2015, three Rotherham Labour MPs, Barron, Sarah Champion and John Healey, started a defamation legal action against UKIP MEP Jane Collins after Collins falsely alleged in a UKIP conference speech that the three MPs knew about child exploitation in Rotherham but did not intervene, and in February 2017 the MPs were awarded £54,000 each in damages.

In October 2016, Barron was found to have broken the parliamentary code in 2011. He was found to have taken funding from the Japanese Pharmaceutical Group to arrange banquets in the House of Commons, against Commons rules.

In the House of Commons he sat on the Committee on Privileges and Speaker&#x27;s Committee for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority and previously sat on the Committee on Standards, Liaison Committee (Commons), Health and Social Care Committee, Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament, Environment Committee and Energy Committee.

Barron campaigned for Remain in the 2016 referendum on the UK&#x27;s EU membership.

He supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour Party leadership election.

Barron was one of only three Labour MPs to vote for Theresa May&#x27;s Brexit deal in the Meaningful vote on 15 January 2019 (along with Ian Austin and John Mann). In June 2019, he was one of only 8 Labour MPs to reject Labour&#x27;s efforts to stop a no-deal Brexit. This decision was extremely controversial, with Barron being widely denounced by members of his party.

In July 2019, he announced he would not be contesting the next general election, which was subsequently held in December of that year.

==Personal life==
Barron married Carol McGrath in 1969 in Rother Valley; the couple had a son and two daughters. Carol Barron died in June 2008. Kevin Barron remarried, to Andree Deane, in 2012. He became stepfather to her three children.. He currently lives in the Peak District.

==Honours==
* He was sworn in as a member of Her Majesty&#x27;s Most Honourable Privy Council in 2001. This gave him the Honorific Title &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for Life.
* He was knighted in the 2014 New Years Honours List. This gave him the Honorific Title &quot;Sir&quot; for Life.

<text>Sir John Dominic Battle, (born 26 April 1951) is a British politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Leeds West from 1987 to 2010. A member of the Labour Party, he served in government as Minister of State for Trade and Industry (1997–1999) and Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (1999–2001) under Tony Blair.

==Early life==
Sir John was born in Bradford and educated at St Paulinus&#x27; School, a primary school in Dewsbury; St Michael&#x27;s College, Underley Hall 1962–1967 (a junior seminary – secondary education – for the training of priests at the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool), and at St Joseph&#x27;s College, Up Holland (1967–1972). Following a year of work, he went to the University of Leeds where he graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English in 1976. From 1976 to 1979, he undertook postgraduate research.

In 1979, he began to work as a research assistant to Derek Enright, a fellow Catholic and a Member of the European Parliament. Sir John gained a seat on the City of Leeds Council in 1980. He chaired the innovative Industry and Employment Committee and later the Housing Committee.

He was chosen to contest the Conservative seat of Leeds North West at the 1983 general election. Donald Kaberry, the Conservative MP since the seat&#x27;s creation in 1955, was retiring. Sir John lost to a sitting MP in Keith Hampson, whose own seat of Ripon had been abolished.

Sir John became the national coordinator for Church Action on Poverty in 1983 and in 1986, was selected to contest the seat of Leeds West, which had seen a shock result at the previous general election. Joseph Dean had been comfortably re-elected as the Labour MP for Leeds West at the 1979 general election, with a majority of over 10,000 votes. However, in 1983 he was defeated by the Liberal candidate Michael Meadowcroft against all predictions; as Leeds West had been held Labour since 1945.

==Parliamentary career==
Against the national swing, Sir John won fairly easily and regained the Leeds West constituency for Labour. Meadowcroft only served one term in Parliament.

Within a year of entering the House of Commons, Sir John was promoted to the Opposition Whip&#x27;s Office by Neil Kinnock in 1988, but resigned in protest at Labour&#x27;s support for the Major ministry over the 1991 Gulf War. After the 1992 general election, he joined the frontbench of the new Labour Party leader, John Smith as a spokesman on Housing. Following Smith&#x27;s death and the election of Tony Blair as Leader of the Labour Party in 1994, Sir John was moved in a reshuffle to the position of Spokesman on Science and Technology. In 1995, he was moved again; this time to the position of Spokesman on Energy.

Following the 1997 general election, Sir John entered the government becoming Minister of State at the Department of Trade and Industry with responsibility for Science, Energy and Industry, announcing the decommissioning of the nuclear power station at Dounreay in 1998. In 1999, he moved sideways to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, but was dropped from government after the 2001 general election. Subsequently, he served on the International Development Committee. In 2002, Sir John became a Member of the Privy Council and was the Prime Minister&#x27;s envoy to all the faith communities until May 2010.

==Family==
He married Mary Meenan in 1977, who is of Irish Catholic extraction and who was a Mathematics researcher at the University of Leeds, where they met at the University Catholic chaplaincy. 
They have a son (born ca. 1980) and two daughters.

==Affiliations==
Sir John is a Fellow of Blackfriars Hall, University of Oxford, and a patron of the International Young Leaders Network and of the St Vincent de Paul Society of England and Wales. He serves as Pro-chancellor of Leeds Trinity University.

==Honours==
On 27 June 2009, Sir John was invested as a Knight Commander with Star of the Order of St Gregory the Great (KC*SG) by Pope Benedict XVI, in recognition of lifelong commitment and loyalty to the local Church and for Sir John&#x27;s political contribution as a Member of Parliament.

Sir John was knighted in the 2022 New Year Honours for political and public service.

<text>Sir Hugh Nigel Edward Bayley (born 9 January 1952) is a British Labour Party politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for York Central, previously York and City of York, from 1992 to 2015.

==Early life==
Bayley was born in Maidenhead, Berkshire, and was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College, the University of Bristol, where he obtained a Politics BSc degree in 1974, before pursuing further studies at the University of York, where he was awarded a BPhil degree in Southern African studies in 1976. After his studies in 1975 he became a District Officer and later a National Officer with NALGO until 1982.

Bayley was elected as a councillor in the London Borough of Camden in 1980 and became the general secretary of the International Broadcasting Trust in 1982. Bayley stepped down as a councillor and moved to York to take up a post as research officer in health economics at the University of York from 1987 to 1992. He was a lecturer in social policy at the university from 1986 until 1998.

==Parliamentary career==
Hugh Bayley was nominated as the Labour candidate for York at the 1987 general election but was defeated by just 147 votes by the Conservative Conal Gregory. After the election, Hugh Bayley became a Health Economics Research Fellow at the University of York, and became a member of the local health authority.

Conal Gregory and Hugh Bayley again fought it out at the 1992 general election in York and this time Bayley won by a comfortable margin. After his election he made his maiden speech on 7 May 1992 and joined the Health Select committee. The name of the York constituency was changed (though with unaltered boundaries) and Bayley won a majority of over 20,000 at the 1997 general election.

After the election, Bayley became the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Health Frank Dobson, who lived near York. In 1998 he was appointed to Tony Blair&#x27;s Government as the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State in the Department of Social Security, responsible for Incapacity, Maternity, Disability benefits and Vaccine damage. He was deputed to bring the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill through the Commons, which attracted much criticism from backbench Labour MPs over plans to means-test and restrict access to incapacity benefit. He was dropped from government after the 2001 general election.

Bayley has since served on the International Development Committee and pioneered the foundation of the Africa All-Party Parliamentary Group, serving as chair for several years, now being its vice-chair. He was president of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly from November 2012 to 2014. He was also a chairman of the Public Bill Committee. The City of York constituency was abolished in 2010, with Bayley being elected in the 2010 general election to represent the successor constituency York Central.

A loyal backbencher, Bayley rarely voted against his party whip.

At the outset of the 2010 parliament, Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow appointed Bayley as a temporary Deputy Speaker to serve for two weeks until the election of Deputy Speakers. Bayley accepted the appointment, but stated that he would serve only temporarily and would not run for a Deputy Speakership, as he preferred to be able to represent his constituents by speaking out on issues before the House.

On 5 December 2014, Bayley announced his intention to stand down as a Labour MP at the 2015 general election.

Bayley was knighted in the 2015 New Year Honours for his &quot;services to parliamentary engagement with NATO&quot;.

==Personal life==

Sir Hugh was active in the Anti-Apartheid Movement in his student days.

On 22 December 1984, in Camden, he married Fenella Jeffers from Nevis; they have a son and a daughter.

<doc id="414610" wikidata="Q697482" url="?curid=414610" title="Ceres, Celestial Legend">
<text>Ceres, Celestial Legend, known in Japan as , is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yuu Watase. It was originally serialized in Shōgakukan&#x27;s magazine &quot;Shōjo Comic&quot; from May 1996 to March 2000, with its chapters collected in 14 &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes. The manga was licensed for English release in North America by Viz Media. The series focuses on Aya Mikage, who learns on her sixteenth birthday that she is the reincarnation of an ancient and supremely powerful celestial maiden or angel (&quot;tennyo&quot;) named Ceres, and her twin brother Aki the reincarnation of Ceres&#x27; former husband, Mikagi, the progenitor of the Mikage family, who had stolen Ceres&#x27; robe. Ceres&#x27; spirit begins manifesting in Aya, and to save her brother she must find Ceres&#x27; long-lost celestial robe, while avoiding being killed or captured by family members who want to use Ceres&#x27;s supreme celestial abilities for their own personal gain.

Pierrot adapted the series into a 24-episode anime television series, broadcast on WOWOW from April to September 2000. The anime series was also licensed by Viz, but has since been re-licensed by Discotek Media.

In 1998, &quot;Ceres, Celestial Legend&quot; won the 43rd Shogakukan Manga Award in the &quot;shōjo&quot; category.

==Plot==
Aya Mikage and her twin brother, Aki, are forced to go to their grandfather&#x27;s home for their sixteenth birthday, unaware that it&#x27;s actually a test to see if they have angel or celestial maiden blood. Aya learns she is one of many reincarnations of a vengeful and supremely powerful celestial maiden named Ceres who takes over her mind and body only under intense stress or fury. 
When she transforms into Ceres, Aya obtains supernatural abilities of flight, teleportation, telepathy, powerful telekinesis, premonition, and superhuman speed; she can also project destructive pink energy blasts from her hands, and create impenetrable shields of bright pink-colored celestial energy. According to myth, Ceres will ultimately exterminate the entire Mikage family in retaliation for stealing her hagoromo (celestial robe), thus preventing her returning home to Heaven. Because of this, Aya&#x27;s paternal grandfather and his party attempt to kill her, but she is saved by Suzumi Aogiri, another descendant of a heavenly maiden with incredibly strong celestial and mental abilities of her, and Suzumi&#x27;s brother-in-law, Yūhi. Aya struggles to control Ceres&#x27; influence over her and appease her spirit once and for all. Her brother Aki is eventually completely taken over by the vengeful spirit of &quot;Mikagi&quot;, the original ancestor/progenitor of the entire Mikage family who stole Ceres&#x27; celestial robe (or &quot;mana&quot;), forcing her to stay with him on Earth. Aya promises Ceres that she will help find the celestial robe in exchange for not killing those who hunt her, especially Aki, since Aya still loves them as family. It&#x27;s revealed-(in Episode 7, &quot;Celestial Awakening&quot;) that &quot;The Hagoromo Legend&quot; not only exists in Japan, but in other countries around the world such as Europe, Africa, all three regions of Oceania, Germany, China, Korea, Russia, and even the United States.

Aya also wrestles with her strong romantic feelings for Toya, a former servant of the Mikage. Toya is trying to kill her as well, and has lost his memory of his past. However, he begins to reciprocate Aya&#x27;s feelings, and they conceive a child together. Toya regains his memory and learns that he was the immortal humanoid organism, also known as &quot;the manna,&quot; that the celestial robe created to help it reunite with Ceres and enable her to reach the full evolution as a celestial maiden. In the end, Aki, having resisted Mikage&#x27;s spirit, sacrifices himself to save Aya, and Toya sacrifices his own manna and immortality to save Aya and their unborn child. Months later, Aya and Toya await the birth of their child, knowing that Toya may have limited time left to live, although Toya did claim that he will live longer, for his new family&#x27;s sake.

==Characters==
: 
: A sixteen-year-old high school girl. She is a direct descendant and reincarnation of a &quot;Tennin&quot; named Ceres, who uses her as a medium for existence. The Mikage family considers Ceres a threat and continuously tries to take Aya&#x27;s life. Aya is horrified but determined to right the past wrongs of her family and recover Ceres&#x27; &quot;hagoromo&quot; so that her family will no longer suffer in fear of her. She falls in love with Toya, and they conceive a child together. In the sequel &quot;Episode of Miku&quot;, Aya gives birth to a girl named Miku and, three years later, a boy named Aki-(Miku&#x27;s younger brother), who is the look-alike reincarnation of her late twin brother. She initially has long blonde hair, light blue eyes and wears a small pair of red earrings that she had given to her brother. During her depression and her confrontation with Miori, her long hair is cut short but later grows into shoulder-length until the end of the anime; her last name-(Mikage) stands for &quot;honorable shadow&quot;.

Because her tragic past was misinterpreted by her descendants, her female reincarnations are relentlessly killed by the Mikage family.

He originally works for Mikage International until he fell in love with Aya, rebelling against them to protect her. It is later revealed that he met Aya when she was a six-year-old child.

He sacrifices the manna bestowed upon him by the celestial robe to give him immortality, saving Aya and protecting their two young children, Miku and Aki.

His fighting outfit is a long forest green coat with a navy blue crop top, along with matching pants and black monk strap shoes; his weapon of choice is a gold and silver Victorian styled dagger capable of shooting out a power red beam that can destroy anything in his path, and a small MP5K machine gun.

==Production==
&quot;Ceres, Celestial Legend&quot; is the third manga series written by Yuu Watase. She based it on the legend of the &quot;tennin&quot; Ceres and her stolen &quot;hagoromo&quot;. This legend is also the basis for one of the most performed Japanese Noh plays, &quot;Hagoromo&quot;. It is the Japanese version of the Swan Maiden legend; versions from other cultures are mentioned throughout the series. As with most of her serials, Watase planned the basic story line of Ceres through to the end before beginning work. She notes that it is easier to work this way, but that even with planning sometimes the characters will &quot;move on their own&quot; and refuse to follow her original plans. When she reaches the end of the work, though, she can understand why they did so. Watase noted that one of the hardest parts of writing a serial manga was having to plan for a cliffhanger at the end of each chapter. She wanted each one to make the reader want to know what happened next, so they would want to keep reading.

To accurately depict the many locations used within the series, Watase traveled to Miyagi, Okinawa, and Tochigi to visit the locations where legends say &quot;Tennin&quot; landed. She was able to negotiate entry into some areas normally closed to the public. The characters in &quot;Ceres&quot; are not based on real people, but Watase notes that each one reflects some part of herself, as does the story as a whole. For example, Watase incorporated her thoughts on genetic engineering and other new technologies through the character of Kagami, who shows cruel disregard for the lives of the celestial beings he creates. While she feels such technologies can be useful to society, they should not be abused. Watase purposefully left Ceres&#x27; true nature ambiguous in the end, never clearly stating whether Ceres is an alien or truly a being descended from heaven. She notes, however, that part of the reason for this was that it wasn&#x27;t something she&#x27;d thought about. On reflection, she felt Ceres was a symbol. In Japan, men are considered the dominant sex, and Watase notes that as a woman there are things about the system that anger her, such as men saying she is &quot;just a woman.&quot; &quot;Ceres&quot; became a story about the relationship between men and women. She also wanted to show that while the &quot;Tennin&quot; and the humans in the story may have come from different origins, and evolved differently, they were still the same living creature in the end, with similar feelings and thoughts.

<text>Dame Margaret Anne Begg DBE (born 6 December 1955) is a Scottish politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Aberdeen South from 1997 to 2015. A member of the Labour Party, she was Chair of the Work and Pensions Select Committee from 2010 to 2015.

Upon her election to Parliament, Begg became the first permanent wheelchair user in the House of Commons since the 19th century.

==Education and early career==
Margaret Anne Begg was educated in Brechin, Angus at Damacre Primary School and Brechin High School. She earned an MA in History and Politics at the University of Aberdeen, and a Secondary Teaching Certificate from the Aberdeen College of Education in 1978.

After gaining her teaching certificate, Begg taught English and History at Webster&#x27;s High School, Kirriemuir. She became the principal English teacher at Arbroath Academy in 1988.

==Parliamentary career==
Following her involvement in teaching unions, Begg joined the Labour Party in 1983. She was selected to stand for Parliament, through an all-women shortlist, as Labour candidate for Aberdeen South. Begg was encouraged to stand by Frank Doran, the former Labour MP for the constituency. At the 1997 general election, she defeated incumbent Conservative MP and government minister Raymond Robertson. She became the second ever permanent wheelchair user in the House of Commons upon her election.

She was re-elected in 2001, 2005 and 2010, becoming the first Labour MP to retain her constituency for more than a single term. At the 2015 general election, Begg lost her seat to SNP candidate Callum McCaig.

Begg made her maiden speech on 21 May 1997. She served as secretary of the All-party parliamentary group (APPG) on the BBC, and chair of the APPGs on Equalities, the Oil and Gas Industry, Chronic Pain, and Commercial Radio. She was a member of the Panel of Chairs and Vice Chair of the Speaker&#x27;s Conference, tasked with looking at the under representation of disadvantaged groups in the Commons. Begg served as Chair of the Work and Pensions Select Committee from June 2010 until the dissolution of Parliament in 2015.

===Votes and political views===
Begg voted in favour of banning smoking in restaurants in April 2003. In December 2004 and October 2005, she voted in favour of the Identity Cards Bill. She voted in favour of allowing unmarried heterosexual and homosexual couples to adopt, and in favour of the Civil Partnership Bill.

In March 2002, she voted to ban the hunting of wild mammals with dogs. She voted in favour of the NHS foundation trust proposal and against the replacement of the Trident system.

She voted in favour of adding clauses to a bill that allow the Secretary of State to detain indefinitely, pending deportation, anyone he suspects is a terrorist, even if the law forbids that person&#x27;s deportation from ever taking place. She voted against allowing people detained at a police station to be fingerprinted and searched for identifying birthmarks unless it is in connection with a terrorism investigation.

In March 2003, she voted against the declaration of war against Iraq.

In June 2003, she voted against a motion that would have recalled the Prime Minister&#x27;s assertion that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction that could be used at 45 minutes&#x27; notice, and launching an independent inquiry into the intelligence received and the decisions that were based on it. In June 2007, she voted against a motion calling for an independent inquiry by a committee of Privy Counsellors into the Iraq War.

In November 2008, Begg was one of 18 MPs who signed a Commons motion backing a Team GB football team at the 2012 Olympics, saying football &quot;should not be any different from other competing sports and our young talent should be allowed to show their skills on the world stage&quot;. The football governing bodies of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all opposed to a Great Britain team, fearing it would stop them competing as individual nations in future tournaments. 

During the 2009 MPs expenses scandal, Begg was one of the first Scottish MPs to take the step of publishing all of her claims under the Additional Costs Allowance on her website before they were released by the House of Commons authorities saying that it was &quot;important people can see how MPs spend taxpayers&#x27; money.&quot;

In June 2011, Begg crossed swords with Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley, over the issue of disabled people being allowed to work for less than minimum wage if they so choose in order to establish themselves in employment. Davies explained that he was representing the views of constituents anxious to get a foothold on the earnings ladder, but Begg believed that this was simply an attempt to discriminate against disabled people.

===National campaigns===
Begg is a vocal campaigner for allowing embryonic stem cells to be used in the research for treatments of diseases, including currently incurable conditions such as Alzheimer&#x27;s and Parkinson&#x27;s Disease. She has also been heavily involved in lobbying the Department of Health against an all-out ban on the pain-relief drug co-proxamol, used by many people who live with chronic pain conditions.

She has also taken the lead in lobbying the government on issues such as the Seafarer&#x27;s Earnings Deduction and compensation for trawlermen who lost their livelihoods during the Cod Wars. In the 2009 Budget, Begg also won a concession from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling MP, that &quot;those caring responsibilities of grandparents of working age will count towards their entitlement to the basic state pension.&quot; Begg had campaigned for grandparents of working age to receive National Insurance Credits in recognition of the fact that their caring role may impact on their contributions to their state pension entitlement.

In the Commons, Begg criticised fraudsters who take advantage of vulnerable people through mail scams and pyramid schemes.

===Local campaigns===
Begg was critical of Aberdeen City Council&#x27;s budget cuts in 2008, and dubbed their behaviour as &quot;draconian&quot; after the council set a debt collection agency on an 80-year-old partially sighted woman for £17.50.

Begg wrote to the Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond requesting a change to the house buying system in Scotland. She also criticised plans to close an Aberdeen school 18 months after it had been saved, saying that they were &quot;closing the school by stealth.&quot;

==Personal life and honours==
Begg lives with Gaucher&#x27;s disease and has been a wheelchair user since 1984. She won the Disabled Scot of the Year award in 1988.

In November 1999, she was knocked from her wheelchair in a road accident outside Aberdeen Airport. Begg sustained a broken leg and wrist, and was hospitalised for three months.

She was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours, for &#x27;services to disabled people and to equal opportunities&#x27;.

<text>Spätzle (), Spätzla or Spatzen, called &quot;nokedli&quot; () in Hungarian, are a type of Central European egg pasta typically served as a side for meat dishes with sauce. Commonly associated with Swabia (hence Swabian spaetzle) and Alsace, it is also found in the cuisines of southern Germany and Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Hungary, Vojvodina, Banat, Slovenia, Lorraine, Moselle, and South Tyrol. It may be served as a side dish or with other ingredients like cheese and onion as a main dish. Spätzle are egg-based pasta of an irregular form with a rough, porous surface. The glutinous dough is put directly into boiling water or steam and the form varies between thin and thick, elongated and short. Spätzle is cooked for the first time during the fabrication. The moist dough is either pressed through a perforated metal plate or it drips through this plate into the boiling water. Other ways to prepare Spätzle are more applicable for domestic use.

A similar round shape, simplified in production, is native to the pre-Alpine Allgäu regions of Bavarian Swabia and Baden-Württemberg as Knöpfle.

==Etymology==
&quot;Spätzle&quot; is the Swabian and Alsacian diminutive of &quot;Spatz&quot;, thus literally &#x27;little sparrow&#x27;. Some linguists derive it from the word “clump”, meaning dough which tends to form clots. In Switzerland they are called &quot;Spätzli&quot; or &quot;Chnöpfli&quot;, in Hungarian &quot;Nokedli&quot; or &quot;Csipetke&quot;, in Slovenian &quot;Vaseršpacli&quot; or &quot;vodni žličniki&quot; and in Ladin &quot;Fierfuli&quot;. The Slovak &quot;Halušky&quot; (Hungarian: &quot;Galuska&quot;) is also similar.
Before the use of mechanical devices, the noodles were shaped by hand or with a spoon, and the results resembled &quot;Spatzen&quot; (plural of &quot;Spatz&quot;, meaning &#x27;sparrows&#x27;, &#x27;sparrow&#x27; is &quot;Spatz&quot; or &quot;Sperling&quot; in German; &quot;Spätzle&quot; is the diminutive of &quot;Spatz&quot;, unchanged in plural).

Spätzle used in this context stands in plural form. In the 18th century this dish was referred to as &quot;Wasserspatzen&quot; (engl. water sparrows). In Switzerland and in Markgräflerland (Margraves’ Land) the dish is called &quot;Spätzli&quot; or &quot;Chnöpfli&quot; and in the Low Alemannic area &quot;Knepfli&quot;. There is an equivalent and common dish in Hungary (&quot;nokedli&quot; and also &quot;galuska&quot; – whereas both terms are naturalised loanwords) and Slovakia (&quot;galuska&quot; or &quot;halušky&quot;) with Austria connecting both cultures. In Northern Austria, Spätzle are called &quot;Nockerln&quot; (as in the dish Eiernockerl) whereas dumplings are also referred to as &quot;Nocken&quot; in Carinthia and Tyrol.

Spätzle which went wrong, which are very lumpy or stick together are also called “raven”, “little stork”, “black horse”, “nightingale”, “grandfather” or “eagle”.

They are also known as &quot;Knöpfle&quot; (diminutive of button) which describes the compact, round form of the noodle. Depending on the form, some regions differentiate between Spätzle (the length exceeds the diameter around more than the fourfold) and Knöpfle (the relation of length to diameter is under two). In everyday language usage, the two names refer to the same product made from the same dough and are interchangeable. There is no clear distinction between how the two names are used, and usage varies from region to region (for example, in Alsace, &quot;Knöple&quot; are typically larger than Spätzle).

==History==
The geographic origin of Spätzle is not precisely known; various regions claim to be the originators of the noodles.

The tradition of making Spätzle can be traced back to the 18th century, although medieval illustrations are believed to place the noodle at an even earlier date. In 1725, Rosino Lentilio, a councillor and personal physician from Württemberg, concluded that &quot;Knöpflein&quot; and &quot;Spazen&quot; were &quot;all the things that are made from flour&quot;. Spelt was grown widely in the Swabian-Alemannic area at the time. The cereal grew on poor soils and was very popular in the region, which was home to small farmers and characterised by poverty. As spelt flour contains high levels of gluten protein, and the dough could therefore be made in times of hardship without the need for eggs, &quot;Schwäbische Spätzle/Schwäbische Knöpfle&quot; were mainly made from spelt. The product achieved fame in the Münsinger Alb upland area. As industrialisation began and prosperity increased, the noodles went from an ordinary, everyday food item to a culinary specialty eaten on feast days. In a description of a Swabian farmers&#x27; village written in 1937, Spätzle are described as a festive food.
The great importance of &quot;Schwäbische Spätzle/Schwäbische Knöpfle&quot; in Swabian cooking can be seen, inter alia, from the 1827 novel &quot;Die Geschichte von den Sieben Schwaben&quot;, according to which the custom in Swabia is &quot;to eat five times a day, five times soup, twice with &quot;Knöpfle&quot; or Spätzle&quot;.

Today, Spätzle are largely considered a &quot;Swabian speciality&quot; and are generally associated with the German state of Baden-Württemberg. In France, they are associated with Alsace and Moselle. Germany&#x27;s estimated annual commercial production of Spätzle is approximately 40,000 tons. Pre-made Spätzle are also available internationally.

===Swabian culture===

In Swabian literature, there is a multitude of poems about “the favourite dish of the Swabian people”. Examples are poems such as &quot;&quot;Das Lob der Schwabenknöpfle&quot; (The Praise of Swabian Knöpfle) which was published in the regional newspaper &quot;Schwarzwälder Bote&quot; (Black Forest Messenger) in 1838, the poem &quot;Schwäbische Leibspeisa&quot;&quot; (The Swabian Favourite Dish) or the “&quot;Spätzles-Lied&quot;” (The Spätzle Song).

The manufacturing of Spätzle in Swabia can be traced back to the 18th century. 
In 1725 the Württembergian council and private physician Lentilius defined &quot;Knöpflein&quot; and &quot;Spatzen&quot; as &quot;everything that is made from flour&quot;. Back then, spelt was widely used in Swabia and Alemannia. 
Since the region was marked by rural peasant structures and poverty, the undemanding grain spelt was very popular since it also thrives in low-nutrient soil. 
Spelt is high in gluten, so in times of scarcity it could be made into a dough without the addition of eggs. Consequently, it is the flour most commonly used in the preparation of Spätzle.

Traditionally, Spätzle are scraped manually on a board, which is still considered a special certification mark. For efficiency reasons, a mechanical production of &quot;homemade&quot; Spätzle comparable with manually scraped ones emerged at the start of the 20th century. With the beginning of industrialisation and progressing prosperity, Spätzle advanced from everyday food to a delicacy eaten during the holidays. People from a Swabian farming village called it a festive dish in 1937. One year prior, regional poet Sebastian Blau (Josef Eberle&#x27;s pseudonym) rendered Spätzle a symbol of Swabian identity: &quot;… Spätzle are the foundation of our cuisine, the glory of our country, … the be-all and end-all of the Swabian menu…&quot;.

Nowadays, Swabian Spätzle or Knöpfle can be found in nearly every product ranges of Swabian pasta producers and since the 1980s, they also have been successfully exported. They are mentioned in many Swabian traditions and celebrations and also form part of tourist activities in terms of culinary specialty weeks or courses, seminars and competitions where Spätzle are scraped (made). There are many cooking competitions and various world records in &quot;Spätzleschaben&quot; (Spätzle scraping). A number of exhibitions document the traditional knowledge of the making of Spätzle in the Swabian region from the very beginnings until today. The great importance of Spätzle for the Swabian kitchen is proofed by the novel &quot;Die Geschichte von den sieben Schwaben&quot; (The history of the seven Swabians), published in 1827, according to which in Swabia exists the tradition &quot;of eating five times a day, which means five times soup, and two times the soup is accompanied by Knöpfle or Spätzle&quot;.

In 1892, Elise Henle explained that a Swabian woman should be able to manufacture Spätzle: &quot;s isch koi richtigs Schwobe-Mädla, des net Spätzla kocha ka&quot; (&quot;t&#x27;is not a real Swabian girl, who isn&#x27;t able to cook Spätzle&quot;). For the modern era the Swabian author Siegfried Ruoß lists more than 50 different Spätzle recipes in his cookbook &quot;&quot;Schwäbische Spätzleküche&quot;. In Bad Waldsee, in upper-Swabia, there is a &quot;Spätzle&quot; museum since 2013.

The earliest recipes for &quot;Spätzle&quot; can be found in the so-called &quot;Göppinger Kochbuch&quot;&quot;, which was composed by Rosina Dorothea Knör (1733–1809) in 1783.

==Protected geographical indication==
Since March 2012, &quot;Swabian Spätzle&quot; and &quot;Swabian Knöpfle&quot; have been awarded the EU quality seal for protected geographical indication (PGI) and are protected throughout Europe as a regional specialty. To be able to bear this sign, one of the production stages of the product must have taken place in the respectively defined region of origin.

==Preparation==

Spätzle is a type of dumpling or noodle. Its dough typically consists of few ingredients, principally eggs, flour, and salt. The Swabian rule of thumb is to use a number of eggs equal to the number of servings, plus one. Water is often added to produce a runnier dough. The flour traditionally used for Spätzle is bread wheat (not the durum wheat used for Italian pasta); however, a more coarsely milled type is used for Spätzle-making than for baking. This flour type is known as &quot;Dunst&quot;, similar to US &quot;first clear&quot; or Czech &quot;hrubá&quot; type. This gives a chewier texture but can produce a dough too crumbly for scraping if no water is added, particularly when cutting short on eggs for dietary reasons. If fine (&quot;all-purpose&quot;) flour and the full amount of eggs are used, all fat and moisture in the dough is derived from these, and water is rarely necessary.

Traditionally, Spätzle are made by scraping long, thin strips of dough off a wooden (sometimes wet) chopping board (&quot;Spätzlebrett&quot;) into boiling salted water, where they cook until they rise to the surface. Altogether, the dough should thus be as viscous as to slowly flow apart if cut into strips with a knife, yet hold the initial shape for some seconds. If dropped into boiling water, the albumen will congeal quickly in the boiling water, while the yolk will keep the dough succulent. After the pasta has become firm, they are skimmed and put aside.

Since this can be a cumbersome way to prepare Spätzle, several devices were invented to facilitate cooking that resemble a strainer or colander, potato ricer (&quot;Spätzlepresse&quot;), food mill, or coarse grater (&quot;Spätzlehobel&quot;). As with scraped Spätzle, the dough drops into the boiling water. Those instruments that use muscle pressure in addition to gravity can be used with a firmer dough; that for a &quot;Spätzlehobel&quot; should be as &quot;runny&quot; as the one for scraping.

===Dough varieties===
For certain specialty dishes, the dough may be enriched with minced pork liver (resulting in &quot;&quot;), spinach or finely grated cheese.

==Dishes==
Spätzle typically accompanies meat dishes prepared with an abundant sauce or gravy, such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Sauerbraten&quot;, &quot;Jägerschnitzel&quot; or &quot;Rouladen&quot;. In Hungary, Spätzle often are used in soup. Spätzle also are used as a primary ingredient in dishes including:

Savory
*&quot;Linsen, Spätzle und Saitenwürstle&quot;: Spätzle with lentils and fine-skinned, frankfurter-style sausages
*&quot;Käsespätzle&quot;: Spätzle mixed with grated cheese (typically Emmentaler) and fried onion
*&quot;Gaisburger Marsch&quot;: traditional Swabian beef stew with potatoes and carrots
*&quot;Krautspätzle&quot;: Spätzle mixed with sauerkraut, onion, butter and spices such as marjoram and/or caraway
* &quot;Spätzle mit Käse überbacken&quot;: Spätzle mixed with cheese and topped with paprika
*&quot;Leberspätzle&quot;: Spätzle mixed with ground liver often served as a soup with a clear broth
*&quot;Spinatspatzeln&quot; (Tyrolean dialect): Spätzle which also contains spinach as one of the ingredients; a speciality of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol
* Roast Spätzle: are baked until golden brown and are a pure soup ingredient.
* Brätspätzle soup: soup with roasted Spätzle.
* Spelt Spätzle: are made of spelt flour.
* Egg Spätzle: The Spätzle are tossed in a pan with melted butter and are mixed with scrambled eggs. 
* Spicy Spätzle stew: minced meat, onions and cabbage or rather chicory are brought to the boil and are mixed with Spätzle.
* “Gaisburger Marsch”: a traditional Swabian stew with Spätzle.
* Potato Spätzle: grated, cooked potatoes are added to the Spätzle dough. 
* Cheese Spätzle: probably the most famous Spätzle dish. These have a special tradition as &quot;Kässpätzle&quot; or &quot;Kässpatza&quot; in Upper Swabia and especially in the Swabian Jura. Traditionally they are served with green salad. In the &quot;Allgäu&quot; and &quot;Vorarlberg&quot;, they are modified as “Käsknöpfle“. Many of these variants have something in common: Spätzle, onions and different types of cheese are layered.

<text>John Robert Beggs (born 20 February 1936), commonly known as Roy Beggs, is a Northern Irish unionist politician and former teacher. Formerly a member of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), he defected to the rival Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in 1981. He served as Member of Parliament (MP) for East Antrim from 1983 to 2005, and was a Larne Borough Councillor from 1973 to 2014, representing the district of Larne Area B and its successor, Larne Lough.

==Background==
Beggs was educated at Ballyclare High School, followed by Stranmillis College, to study teacher training. After his training Beggs became a teacher at Larne High School and had risen to be deputy principal before leaving the profession upon his election to the Westminster Parliament.
===Political career===
He first entered politics in 1973 as a councillor for Larne Borough Council. for the Democratic Unionist Party. He was suspended from the party in 1981 after taking part in a council visit to Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council local authority in Dublin. He moved to the Ulster Unionist Party and was re-elected in 1981 as a &#x27;loyalist&#x27;. He joined the UUP in 1982 and has retained his council seat to date, serving several terms as Mayor of Larne from 1978 until 1983. In 1982 he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly representing North Antrim.

In 1983 he was selected for the new East Antrim in the 1983 general election. With most expecting the DUP to win the seat, he became the new MP in the surprise result. He held the position until the 2005 general election when he was defeated by Sammy Wilson of the DUP. He was UUP Education Spokesman from 1986 up to and including his last few years in Parliament when he also served as Deputy Leader and Chief Whip of the Ulster Unionist Parliamentary Party.

Beggs was known as one of the more hard-line members of the UUP, being vociferous in his Euroscepticism and his suspicions about the Belfast Agreement - initially involving himself in &quot;Union First&quot; (a group within the Ulster Unionist Party opposed to the Agreement), although in his final two years in Parliament, he appeared publicly supportive of the Agreement and of leader David Trimble. A renowned opponent of &quot;progressive&quot; teaching methods and a supporter of maintaining Northern Ireland&#x27;s grammar schools, he attacked proposals to abolish academic selection in post-primary education in Northern Ireland.

Beggs was also a strong supporter of the Orange Order during their stand-off over Drumcree Church and in 1995 took part in a blockade of the port of Larne as part of a show of solidarity. Beggs was charged with Public Order offences for his involvement and was fined £1,350. In March 2001, he apologised in the House of Commons for failing to register a local business interest.
==Personal life==
He lives in Larne and operates a farm and owns a landfill site. He is also the Chairman of the North Eastern Education and Library Board, as well as continuing his council work. He has four children. His son, Roy Beggs Jr was a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly from 1998 until losing his seat in the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election.

<text>Anachronox is a 2001 role-playing video game produced by Tom Hall and the Dallas Ion Storm games studio. The game is centered on Sylvester &quot;Sly Boots&quot; Bucelli, a down-and-out private investigator who looks for work in the slums of Anachronox, a once-abandoned planet near the galaxy&#x27;s jumpgate hub. He travels to other planets, amasses an unlikely group of friends, and unravels a mystery that threatens the fate of the universe. The game&#x27;s science fiction story was influenced by cyberpunk, film noir, and unconventional humor. The story features a theme of working through the troubles of one&#x27;s past.

Gameplay in &quot;Anachronox&quot; is a mix of real-time exploration and turn-based combat; the player controls a party of up to three characters as they explore a 3D environment of futuristic cities, space vessels, and outdoor areas. Inspirations for the game include older role-playing video games such as &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; and the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, animator Chuck Jones and the novel &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;. The game was built with a heavily modified version of id Software&#x27;s &quot;Quake II&quot; engine, rewritten chiefly to allow a wider color palette, emotive animations and facial expressions, better lighting, particle effects, and camera effects.

The development of &quot;Anachronox&quot; was long and difficult. Originally planned for a third-quarter 1998 release, it was released worldwide in June 2001 for Microsoft Windows. Tom Hall planned to create a sequel with the copious content removed during production. Critics enjoyed the game and awarded it high marks for its design and story. Ion Storm&#x27;s Dallas offices were closed mere days after the game&#x27;s release. In 2002, &quot;Anachronox&quot; cinematic director Jake Hughes spliced together gameplay footage and cutscenes to create a feature-length, award-winning machinima film.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Anachronox&quot; is a role-playing game similar in nature to many Japanese role-playing video games like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. The player controls a party of up to three characters as they explore a 3D environment (colloquially known as a &quot;field map&quot;) of futuristic cities, space vessels, and outdoor areas. Players can swap for new party members, talk to non-player characters, and collect and shop for equipment and items. When players near an interactive character or item, a floating arrow-shaped electronic device called the LifeCursor appears, which lets the player click on the person or item. After a certain point in the story, players can travel by shuttle to other planets, triggering cutscenes of the shuttle trips. Each playable character has a unique skill, such as lockpicking, which may be used to solve puzzles. Some sequences involve minigames, such as an unnamed mission in which the player pilots a fighter spaceship to destroy enemies with lasers. Certain field maps also feature simple two-dimensional minigames, including the original games Ox and Bugaboo. The protagonist Boots also possesses a camera, which the player can use to take screenshots for their own enjoyment or as part of quest objectives.

Enemy encounters trigger a combat mode. As in &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party and thus are not random. Similar to &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;″s Active Time Battle, each character has a meter that gradually fills with time. When the meter is full, characters can physically attack enemies, use MysTech magic, unleash BattleSkill attacks, use items, move to a different position, or use a nearby object to attack, if present. For playable characters and computer-controlled enemies, each attack has their number of hit points (a numerically based life bar) get reduced, which can be restored through healing items or MysTech slags. Use of MysTech and equippable shield cells require Neutron-Radiated Glodents (NRG), a separate energy reserve displayed beneath a character&#x27;s life bar. NRG is replenished through certain items. Use of BattleSkills require Bouge, a third bar beneath NRG that automatically fills with time; players can use different BattleSkills depending on how full the Bouge bar is. Some characters must undergo certain plot developments to unlock their BattleSkills. When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints. If all the player&#x27;s characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved game. Winning battles earns experience points and raises characters&#x27; levels, granting them improved statistics. These statistics can be viewed through the status screen, which displays important character information and current quests. Unlike many other RPGs, &quot;Anachronox&quot; displays a character&#x27;s attributes with qualitative descriptors (such as Poor and Excellent) instead of integers.

===MysTech===
The Mysterium Tech (or MysTech) system allows players to use in-game objects collectively known as MysTech, and create new MysTech by using a configuration screen accessed through Elementor Host items. MysTech cannot be used until they are awakened after a certain story event. Eight basic colors of MysTech exist, representing different elements; for example, green represents poison. Players can use MysTech to inflict damage upon enemies, plague them with certain status effects (such as freezing them in place), or heal party members. Casting status effect-MysTech on party members will cure them if afflicted by enemy status spells. MysTech slabs and Elementor Hosts can be found as treasure in the game world or bought from shops. To create MysTech, players place colored bugs (found on small hills in several game locations) in empty slots on an Elementor Host. The color of bugs placed in the function slot determines the color of MysTech, while other slots modify the power and/or range of the spell. Players can add special bugs known as Cobalt Crawlers to make a spell target all enemies instead of one; a Host filled with eight Crawlers unlocks a secret spell. The effect of bugs can be amplified by feeding them petals from Lifeflowers, which can be found scattered throughout the world of &quot;Anachronox&quot;. Special types of Hosts with two or three different functions allow players to pick which MysTech function to use in battle.

== Plot ==

===Setting===
The game takes place on Anachronox (a portmanteau of &quot;anachronism&quot; and &quot;noxious,&quot; meaning &quot;poison from the past&quot;), a small planet floating inside a huge artificial sphere known as Sender One. Husks of futuristic cities exist on artificial tectonic plates, which constantly shift to connect different parts of the planet. Inhabitants believe that diseased aliens were quarantined there eons ago, resulting in the name Anachronox. Northern Anachronox is clean and upscale, while southern Anachronox is crime-ridden and run-down. Humanity travels to different planets from Sender One, which had been the center of a transportation system for a race of non-humanoids enabling faster-than-light travel. Inbound and outbound traffic stops at Sender Station, an orbiting construct above Sender One with hotels and a red light district. Civilizations conduct business using currency like the one-dollar coin known as a &quot;loonie&quot;, while several people collect MysTech—shards of rock with markings, believed to be dormant weapons or art pieces created by an extinct alien race. MysTech were first found 300 years ago, and are poorly understood, though avidly collected.

Other planets in Sender One include Sunder, Hephaestus, Democratus, and Limbus. The galaxy&#x27;s scientific community is headquartered on the temperate planet of Sunder, and people are only permitted to go there if they are sufficiently intelligent. Hephaestus is an important religious center. A mostly volcanic planet, Hephaestus hosts a town and temple complex of monks who study MysTech. Democratus is climatically similar to Earth, with regions of desert, snow, forest, and prairie. Several populations of different sentient species exist on the surface, but the planet is ruled by a race of tall, thin humanoids with large craniums who dwell on a large mechanical ring constructed around the planet. This race is obsessed with the ideal of democracy, and though they possess incredible scientific and engineering knowledge, they are constantly bogged down by their own ineptitude and the frailties of the democratic process. Limbus is known as the &quot;planet of death&quot;, as voyagers never return; its surface is arid and rocky, with sparse vegetation. A planet mentioned but not seen in the game is Krapton, home to superheroes and villains. Most of Krapton&#x27;s human population has fled, tired of being constantly abducted and saved by warring superpeople.

=== Characters ===
The protagonist of &quot;Anachronox&quot; is Sylvester &quot;Sly Boots&quot; Bucelli, a human and former private detective on Anachronox. Twenty-nine years old and described as &quot;bold, brash, and overconfident&quot;, Boots has gotten himself into trouble and now runs his agency out of rented storage space above a seedy bar. His only friends are PAL-18, his spirited, sarcastic robot assistant since childhood, and Fatima Doohan, his secretary. Fatima was fatally injured and digitized by Boots onto a PDA-analogue &quot;LifeCursor&quot;, where she bitterly lives to render assistance. Several allies join Boots over the course of the game; first is 71-year-old Grumpos Matavastros, a &quot;scholar, outdoorsman, eccentric recluse, and renaissance man&quot;—and a very grumpy person. A former curator of the MysTech museum on Anachronox, Grumpos devotes his life to studying the artifacts. Dr. Rho Bowman joins the party on Sunder; she is a brilliant scientist who&#x27;s been branded a heretic after publication of her book, &quot;MysTech Awake!&quot; The team then gains support from Democratus, an eccentric planet boasting a planetary ring and brilliant technology. Said technology includes having the planet shrink to human height to be part of the team. Two further allies are the femme fatale Stiletto Anyway—a 25-year-old former companion of Boots known for being stealthy and aloof—and Paco &quot;El Puño&quot; Estrella, a washed up superhero who&#x27;s turned to alcoholism after his comic book series was canceled. Their foes include Detta, a heavyset crime boss/kingpin on planet Anachronox, and several other monsters and shady characters.

===Story===
Sly Boots lives in a cheap apartment above Rowdy&#x27;s, a bar in the seedy &quot;Bricks&quot; section of South Anachronox. Grumpos Matavastros commissions Boots to find a piece of MysTech, but a crime boss called Detta accosts them and steals it. Grumpos, Boots, and robot assistant PAL-18 then seek out Dr. Rho Bowman, an expert on MysTech, at an institute for troublesome scientists on Sunder. She undertakes an experiment to activate MysTech, apparently causing the destruction of Sunder. Rho and the others escape the planet on a shuttle, and drift in space for seventeen days until they are brought on board a habitat ring around the planet Democratus. Rho discovers that all MysTech is now active, and can grant powers and spells. Boots pilots a fighter ship to save Democratus from insectoid invaders known as the Verilent Hive. The heroes return to Sender Station&#x27;s Lounge of Commerce; Democratus joins the party, the High Council having shrunken the planet to human height. While searching for equipment, Boots earns money as an erotic dancer and encounters Stiletto Anyway, an old flame who&#x27;s become an assassin and plots revenge against Detta. Rho explains that the universe operates on the big bounce principle; a universe that forms with a Big Bang will eventually suffer a Big Crunch, giving rise to a new big bang. She explains that Sunder was destroyed by an injection of matter from the previous universe, which will hasten the current universe&#x27;s big crunch. If enough matter is switched between universes, the previous one can escape a big crunch and the current one will cease to exist.

The team heads to Hephaestus, transformed to a tourist destination now that MysTech is active. They realize MysTech functions can be customized through the use of small, colored bugs and a MysTech host. Sly gains audience with the Grand Mysterium, who tells him that in the next universe, species known as &quot;Chaos&quot; and &quot;Order&quot; fought a bitter war. Order enslaved Chaos in the current universe, but Chaos wishes to escape to the previous universe to prevent future ones from existing and thus eradicate Order. The Mysterium tells Sly he must find and seal off the gate to the previous universe, and to journey to Limbus. The team is captured en route by comic supervillain Rictus; Boots meets former superhero Paco in his prison. Rictus flushes them into empty space; the High Council of Democratus restores the planet to its original size to save them.

Scenes of reflection reveal the past on Anachronox. Stiletto had been Sly&#x27;s young assistant at his upscale agency; he was in love with her, but Fatima was in love with him. Detta abducted Stiletto, spurring Sly&#x27;s search. Her love unrequited, Fatima went into his office one night to leave a note of resignation. Sly burst in with news of Stiletto&#x27;s location, and he and Fatima pursued Detta across Anachronox by flying car. Sly lost control, wrecking it and accidentally killing Fatima. Suffering from major depression, Sly ran up debts with Detta to pay for Fatima&#x27;s revival inside the LifeCursor.

The team regather at Democratus and journey to Limbus, where they meet creatures of the same race as the Grand Mysterium. They repel invaders called the &quot;Dark Servants&quot; from an orbital portal. The leader of Limbus explains that though Chaos is enslaved in the current universe, the Dark Servants (who originate from the current universe) are trying to free them and have found a way into the previous universe, where they initiated the destruction of Sunder. MysTech is a gift from the forces of Order to help the current universe&#x27;s inhabitants fight Chaos. The team return to Anachronox to find Rowdy, a disguised citizen of Limbus who has been searching for the gate to the previous universe. Rowdy notes that they must destroy the key to the gate, now in the possession of Detta. The team infiltrate his fortress, kill him, and prepare to destroy the key at the gate itself—the fountain spiral of Anachronox. Grumpos seizes it, revealing himself to be a Dark Servant; he escapes with the agents of Chaos into the previous universe. Sly and the others prepare to follow them and save the universe; the game ends as they approach the gate.

== Development ==

===Conception===
Ion Storm began developing &quot;Anachronox&quot; in 1996, funded by Eidos Interactive as part of a three-game deal alongside &quot;Daikatana&quot; and an unplanned third game. Formal announcement followed in April 1997, promising a third-quarter 1998 release. Tom Hall, veteran designer and one of the founders of Ion Storm, helmed the project and originated most of its story and design. Other founding members of the team were Todd Porter (producer), Jake Hughes (associate producer and director of cinematics), Ben Herrera (artist), Brian Eiserloh (programmer), and David Namaksy (lead mapper). Mapper Larry Herring was hired after being mentored by John Romero and submitting a custom &quot;Doom 2&quot; map to Tom Hall. Hall first conceived &quot;Anachronox&quot; in his bathroom, prompting him to install a whiteboard and sound-recorder in his shower, as well as several notepads around his house for future ideas; he had conceived the character Sly Boots years earlier in college. He wrote a 460-page design document (completed in May 1997) outlining the universe of &quot;Anachronox&quot;, beyond the game&#x27;s scope; other game design documents of the period, he noted, were usually only 125 pages in size. He then condensed the story, leaving a third beyond the scheduled game. The game&#x27;s design phase lasted three months. Hall made plans for two expansion packs from the outset of development, owing to the huge story. Developers told &quot;Next Generation&quot; the story would be &quot;Campbellian&quot; and feature immense environments. Hall noted in mid-1997, &quot;Not since &quot;Keen&quot; has a universe been so clear in my head.&quot;

Tom Hall announced that &quot;Anachronox&quot; would feature a &quot;turbulent story with a roller coaster of emotion&quot;, and promised it would bring personality and humor to the role-playing genre. Hall aimed to make an emotionally gripping, cinematic experience from the beginning: &quot;I want this game to answer the question, &#x27;Can a computer make you cry?&#x27; I want to make the characters so warm and friendly and lovable and identifiable... I want to start them off in fun situations, but as the game goes on, I want the atmosphere to get darker and darker. Friends betray the lead character, other friends die, and you will feel some of what they feel because you have been with these people for 50 hours, and in a sense, lived part of their lives with them.&quot; Hall remarked that the characters were facets of his childhood. He later compared the name &quot;Anachronox&quot; (meaning poison from the past) and the internal struggles of each character, caused by turbulent events in their pasts and &quot;psychic poison.&quot; Hall aimed to feature high-quality direction and camera-work in &quot;Anachronox&quot;, reminiscent of epic cinematic themes in role-playing video games like the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise. Hall enlisted producer Jake Hughes to direct cut scenes; Hughes had previously worked on several short independent films. Developers used real-time game cutscenes instead of live-action cinematics to avoid &quot;[taking] players out of the game.&quot; Hall remarked, &quot;All these games switch to cutscenes that look five hundred times better than the game. The secret is not to let the cutscenes kick the game&#x27;s ass.&quot;

Tom Hall chose the &quot;Quake&quot; engine for &quot;Anachronox&quot;; its developer John Carmack took interest in its use for a role-playing game. Ion Storm would soon switch to the &quot;Quake II&quot; engine, necessitating a transition from December 1997 to March 1998. The team would implement engine support for 32-bit color, particle systems, a spline-based camera scriptor, facial deformations, and lip-synching. The team mimicked filmography via sweeping camera shots to compensate for graphical limitations. Facial deformation involved moving the vertices of a character&#x27;s face, thereby creating emotional expressions and body language. Developers built the first models in Lightwave; the main characters had polygon counts of 500–700. By the end of 1997, Hall had scripted interaction with 130 non-player characters for 160 planned locations. Hall cited &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; as a strong influence; previewers drew parallels with the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series and &quot;Ultima III&quot;. As in &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, battles were scripted and not caused by random, unavoidable encounters. Hall explained, &quot;if there&#x27;s a dragon guarding a door, I want the chance to say, &#x27;whoah, look at the time, gotta run&#x27;, not, &#x27;think I&#x27;ll check this door. (*roaaar*) Dragon? Where the hell was &quot;that&quot;?!?&#x27;&quot; The team expanded the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;-style combat by allowing actions to be queued in advance. Hall listed some of his inspirations for &quot;Anachronox&quot; in mid-2000: &quot;In movies, some inspirational people are Spielberg, Hitchcock, George Roy Hill, Rob Reiner, and now Sam Mendes. Also a big fan of Chuck Jones, who directed Warner Brothers cartoons. Novels: &quot;Gateway&quot;, &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot;, so many more. Games: &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, LucasArts adventures (Ron Gilbert and Tim Schafer rock), &quot;Ape Escape&quot; (buy it now), &quot;Mario&quot;, &quot;Ultima III&quot;, &quot;Wizardry I&quot;, oh, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m forgetting some!&quot; Hall also drew dramatic inspiration from a scene in &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; in which the characters discuss the theme of regret around a campfire.

===Programming and design===
As production continued, Tom Hall dubbed the game&#x27;s scripting language &quot;APE&quot; (Anachronox Programming Language). Hall explained, &quot;I call it my new Apple II because it&#x27;s so much fun to program in and it takes all the drudgery out of it. It&#x27;s sort of if you mushed together C, Basic and Java in a way—for programming people it&#x27;s sort of Windows based. It began as a defined dialogue window, but provided variables so that you could position and move a picture. So from there it grew like UNIX with little bits and pieces, and you have things that initialize data to the window, things that constantly update the window, and things that happen after the window, in little code chunks and with that you can do any little thing.&quot; Hall wrote and coded the mini-game Bugaboo for &quot;Anachronox&quot; in 15 hours to demonstrate the environment&#x27;s simplicity. Other tools developed for the game were B.E.D. (a battle editor), ION Radiant (for level design, based on QERadiant), NoxDrop (for item and character placement), and Planet (a spline-based camera system coded by Joey Liaw). Ion Storm worked with QuakeEd developer Robert Duffy to create QERadiant, later adapted to ION Radiant. Hall lauded Planet: &quot;you can control entities on paths, trigger events, manipulate particles, and do just about anything you please. One of the more common team beliefs is that the only true limit to Planet is the person controlling it.&quot; Hall aimed to provide several end-user modification tools, such as one to allow gamers to create their own MysTech elements. Other programs would allow implementation of new dialogue, voice-acting, and camera work. Ion Storm developed tutorials and documentation for each tool.

Developers tasked both art and map design personnel with creating levels, ensuring visual quality. Hall implemented a &quot;grow as you play&quot; philosophy, choosing to show certain features and statistics (like &quot;Beat&quot; or the use of MysTech) only after the player enabled their use. Developers sought to make the game accessible to expert and casual players through two statistic displays—numerical or qualitative (using categories such as &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;). Hall disparaged complicated number systems found in other games: &quot;One of the things I hate about RPGs is, you&#x27;ve got, like, &#x27;here&#x27;s this thing and here&#x27;s that thing&#x27; and it&#x27;s like &#x27;this is 52 and that&#x27;s 53&#x27; I mean, what&#x27;s the difference? It&#x27;s like, OK it&#x27;s &#x27;a point,&#x27; and the formula will come up to be like &#x27;two points&#x27; and like, sure, that&#x27;s going to make a difference. So now I have to hit the guy three times...&quot; Hall also sought to ensure players knew their next goal, and invented the character of Fatima Doohan to keep track of missions. Fatima&#x27;s name is a pun born from the phrase, &quot;What am I doing?&quot; Hall named her after the experience of loading an old saved game in an RPG and having forgotten what comes next in the current quest or storyline.

Ion Storm contracted Soundelux Design Music Group to provide music for &quot;Anachronox&quot;. The firm hired Bill Brown for additional music. Tom Hall was impressed with Brown&#x27;s work, particularly music for the planet Democratus. Hall worked with musician Ron Jones and a local Dallas band to record the game&#x27;s two funk numbers by mid-1998. Tom Hall planned for each character to have their own theme music, and for songs to change via interaction or exploration. He spoke of the planned music, &quot;The Anachronox sound will be industrial, mixed with forties bluesy swing. As you get on later in the game, the music gets scarier, more chaotic, and gets down to hard-core metal.&quot; Developers integrated DirectMusic support in 1999 to allow dynamic changing of background music. Sound programmer Henrik Jonsson implemented 3D sound and other capabilities using the Miles Sound System. Developers also planned to use software called Magpie Pro to lip-sync animated mouths to spoken words. The team chose not to record voices for each line of dialogue, as Tom Hall felt certain speech would become repetitive. The Undermain Theatre group of Dallas provided several voices. Tom Hall voiced PAL-18 reportedly because &quot;no one else got it goofy enough&quot;.

===Promotion and later development===
Ion Storm debuted a trailer for the game at E3 1997. The team worked several long nights and slept in a cardboard fort (named &quot;Fort Nox&quot;) in the office to prepare the trailer. A thief stole the developers&#x27; laptop at the Dallas airport, requiring Ion Storm to upload a new demo for the conference. Hall continued writing and designing; he invented the Brebulan language by creating several phonemes and glyphs of the letter 8 turned on its side. Ben Herrera completed several sketches of characters and worlds by August 1997, and the team hoped to achieve full engine functionality by September 2, Hall&#x27;s birthday. The game would suffer serious delays in its production. Eidos regularly sent producer James Poole to Dallas to check progress. After Ion Storm exhausted the initial $13 million provided for &quot;Daikatana&quot; and &quot;Anachronox&quot;, Eidos purchased a controlling stake in the company to install John Kavanagh as President in hopes of speeding development; monthly expenditures meanwhile rose to $1.2 million.

Ion Storm solicited feedback from fans after demonstrating progress on &quot;Anachronox&quot; at E3 1998, and assured inclusion of a multiplayer mode. Tom Hall touted, &quot;It is going to be very cinematic and about as non-linear as you can get. Some levels will be bigger than anything ever seen in a 3-D environment. We are really pushing the engine for this, with loads of textures.&quot; Developers made two demonstrations; the second featured lasers, lens flare, and volumetric fog. The gaming press received &quot;Anachronox&quot; well; one reporter wrote the game was &quot;stunningly beautiful...[with] some of the most superb effects ever seen in a computer game, including rippling water, stunning laser lights and shadow effects&quot;. Another wrote that the game would be &quot;graphically spectacular, with detailed characters&quot;. Panelists at E3 nominated &quot;Anachronox&quot; in the &quot;Most Promising Game&quot; and &quot;Best RPG&quot; categories for the Game Critics Awards. Ion Storm planned for a 1999 release, and unveiled new screenshots at the 1998 European Computer Trade Show. Among the game&#x27;s maps developed in 1998 were Hephaestus (polished by David Namaksy); Whitendon (Iikka Keränen); Democratus, &quot;Matrix 0&quot;, and certain interiors of Anachronox (Larry Herring); and the city of Limbus (Rich Carlson). Lead programmer Joey Liaw left Ion Storm to attend Stanford University in mid-1998. That November, several developers at Ion Storm departed to form their own company; among them was David Namaksy, lead level designer for &quot;Anachronox&quot;. Leaked e-mails evidencing leadership struggles at Ion Storm the following January eroded morale among the remaining team.

As of January 1999, Ion Storm CEO Todd Porter expected the game to ship 2.5 million copies. Ion Storm decided to produce a sequel for &quot;Anachronox&quot; around early 1999, feeling there would otherwise be too much content for one game, requiring prohibitive costs and delays. Team member Brian Eiserloh noted that several art assets had already been created for the sequel. By May 1999, the team had settled on a cast of 450 non-player characters, and planned for a late 1999 or early 2000 release date. Ion Storm launched the &quot;Anachronox&quot; website in early 1999 with a movie-style trailer. Tom Hall featured four &quot;Anachronox&quot; non-player characters in his online tongue-in-cheek spoof of Kasparov versus the World. Among the game&#x27;s maps completed in 1999 were the Bricks slums of Anachronox (Seneca Menard), Ballotine (Josh Jay), Sender Station (Lee Dotson), others parts of Democratus (Matt Sophos), the Casinox area of Anachronox (Brian Patenaude), and the junkyard maze of Anachronox. Tom Hall reported in 1999 that an option was being developed to remove adult themes, later manifested as an option to turn off profanity. Ion Storm demonstrated the game at E3 1999; the team drove an RV to the event, which suffered a blowout and electrical failure. &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; afterward commented that &quot;Anachronox&quot; had &quot;wider roots than a Banyan grove and more promise per square byte than a CD collection of political speeches.&quot;

Hall personally invented and scripted Boots&#x27;s erotic dancing mini-game. He noted, &quot;we&#x27;re not above degrading our main character.&quot; Ion Storm showed off the mini-game at E3 2000, drawing humored reactions. Art director Lee Perry noted in March 2000 that perfecting the battle system was the biggest remaining hurdle for release. Ion Storm promoted a fall 2000 release date in May, and IGN reported in July that a Dreamcast port of &quot;Anachronox&quot; was planned for production after the PC version&#x27;s release. Ion Storm issued a clarification that they were only considering a Dreamcast port. The team finished the game&#x27;s control setup in August. Ion Storm loaned staff to the team of &quot;Daikatana&quot; to speed its release in summer 2000. Though losing money, Eidos allowed development of &quot;Anachronox&quot; to continue due their high esteem of Tom Hall, as well as a desire not to punish the game&#x27;s team for the delays resulting from assisting &quot;Daikatana&quot;. Eidos maintained no expectations of profit, and merely hoped &quot;Anachronox&quot; would recoup its budget.

The team began working six-day weeks by late 2000. By 2001, the team was working 12- to 16-hour days and 6- to 7-day weeks. Hall described weekly bug meetings before release: &quot;you see 100 bugs at the start of the week, fix the 80 you can replicate, and then meet the next Monday to address the 200 bugs they found, fix the 160 you can replicate, then meet to discuss the 400 they found...the time in-between is scary. Usually, the programmers find the bug, then stumble out of their cube, &#x27;we were SO lucky to find that&#x27; or &#x27;how did that EVER work?&#x27; It&#x27;s like some bizarre divination method that no one is quite sure how it finds things, but no one wants to &#x27;disturb the mojo&#x27;.&quot; Several Internet rumors that Ion Storm would soon close spread in May 2001. By June 2001, all dialogue had been recorded and Ion Storm was working on balancing, playtesting, and adjusting gameplay; release was set for the next month. &quot;Anachronox&quot; went gold and shipped to manufacturers in late June.

=== Release and patches ===
&quot;Anachronox&quot; was released on June 27, 2001, in North America, July 6 in the United Kingdom, and July 31 in Australia. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; packaged a game demo of &quot;Anachronox&quot; with its 100th issue. &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; staged a giveaway of three game copies to coincide with its release in Oceania. By the end of 2001, sales of &quot;Anachronox&quot; in North America had reached 20,480 units, according to PC Data. Vice later estimated sales four months after initial launch at 40,000 units. The game was rereleased in Oceania as a budget title in 2004.

Team member Lucas Davis compiled the development tools and documentation for &quot;Anachronox&quot; and released them in August 2001. Four bug-fixing patches exist for &quot;Anachronox&quot;. Ion Storm created the first (1.01), which fixes a buffer overrun crash occurring especially under Windows 2000. Ion Storm released the first patch (1.01) on July 2, 2001, shortly before its offices were shuttered. Joey Liaw set up a GeoCities website for reporting bugs and technical information after the game&#x27;s release, and worked on a new patch in his spare time. The second patch (1.02, or build 44) was released in May 2003. This patch overhauls the save-game system, adds taxi-cabs between distant points in the Bricks and provides important stability fixes. It was followed by another patch by Joey Liaw, version 1.02 (build 45), released September 2003. In April 2004, a fan-made unofficial patch got released (version 1.02 (build 46) which fixes most of the remaining bugs. Fans have translated the game into German and released a conversion patch. Level designer Rich Carlson released a scrapped secret level for &quot;Anachronox&quot; in February 2004 after finding it on an old floppy disk.

== Reception ==
&quot;Anachronox&quot; earned positive reviews from critics. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called it the most original game Ion Storm had produced, while &quot;The Scotsman&quot;&#x27;s reviewer appreciated its &quot;many original touches&quot;. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; featured &quot;Anachronox&quot; four times in its top 100 PC games lists: #16 (2007), #17 (2008), #61 (2010), &amp; #76 (2015). It was also &quot;USA Today&quot;&#x27;s Game of the Week. Writer Jeff Green lamented that Ion Storm had shut down after &quot;Anachronox&quot;; he called it &quot;easily the best console-style RPG ever made for the PC.&quot;

Reviewers highlighted the gameplay style, branded an unusual mix between role-playing video games and PC first-person shooters. Some compared it to the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series and &quot;Deus Ex&quot;. &quot;The Evening Standard&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Anachronox&quot; swaps puzzlement for humour while keeping the character interaction, deep storyline and strategic battles that make the Japanese games so good.&quot; &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; felt the game &quot;incorporates the best elements of the adventure and role-playing genres.&quot; In contrast, &quot;Next Generation&quot; felt the genre-blending resulted in generic gameplay at times. Lyndon Russell of the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; praised the basic mechanics, though he found the combat predictable. Erik Wolpaw praised the battle system&#x27;s unique focus on movement, but wished characters could wait for a turn rather than perform an action. The puzzle elements, such as those brought by Fatima, were well-received, even considered &quot;indispensable&quot;.

The game&#x27;s aesthetics were strongly praised. One reviewer appreciated the variety of styles in the music; it has been compared to Yanni, Enya, John Tesh, and sci-fi scores. Alan Dang contrarily found the music at times &quot;neutral&quot; and generic; Paul Ward found it pleasant but sparse. Numerous critics praised the voice acting and dialogue. The game&#x27;s cinematic cutscenes were also acclaimed; &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; noted they were &quot;superbly used for laughs or to create a real sense of dramatic tension&quot;, while &quot;Next Generation&quot; wrote that &quot;Anachronox&quot; would be remembered as the germination point for blending interactive gaming and cinema. &quot;The Guardian&quot;, while also giving praise, found them somewhat predictable. Several reviewers praised the field map and level design of all but the last levels. Earlier ones were said to contain many &quot;little details that bring the game to life&quot; and significant immersion. The later levels were less well received, with one reviewer suspecting that Ion Storm ran out of time to polish the game, as some end-game locations were &quot;hideously ugly, with huge slab-like polygons, dodgy backdrops and pixelated low resolution textures&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; felt the lighting was too dark in general, while Kevin Cheung of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; found the graphics blocky.

Reviewers hailed the story, characters, setting, and dialogue of &quot;Anachronox&quot;, citing its science fiction themes and offbeat, quirky humor. &quot;The Advertiser&quot; summarized the plot as &quot;a beefy storyline loaded with strong characters, powerful dialogue, outrageous humour, seemingly endless surprises and a wild ride around the galaxy.&quot; Elliott Chin singled out the game&#x27;s humor, which, while divisive of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s staff at first, won it the publication&#x27;s &quot;Best Use of Humor&quot; 2001 award. Even apart from humor, the dialogue was acclaimed as &quot;so clever, it almost distracts from the game play&quot; and as &quot;very natural and colloquial&quot;. David Gordon of &quot;The Independent&quot; enjoyed the game for its &quot;dark and ominous&quot; plot and setting, centered on the quest to stop the destruction of the universe. The setting was compared to &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, film noir, &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;Total Recall&quot; and the &quot;Dark City&quot; franchise. Reviewers enjoyed the game&#x27;s odd characters and how the team of &quot;has-beens and rejects&quot; brought new life to the genre, particularly by averting the coming-of-age cliché. Sly was well-received, described as a &quot;typical downtrodden B-movie private eye&quot;, a &quot;Mickey Spillane-style hero&quot; in a cyberpunk setting, and a &quot;space-age Sam Spade&quot;. Several critics complained about the game&#x27;s slow start on the planet Anachronox, especially its elevator-riding scenes. Reviewer Elliott Chin disagreed, evoking &quot;a superb sense of timing, starting out small and slowly building to the main event&quot;, while David Phelan stated that strong character writing would encourage gamers to play beyond the &quot;pedestrian-paced&quot; opening scenes.

Several critics took issue with the game&#x27;s graphics and outdated Quake II engine; reviewer Stephen Hunt named the game &quot;a muddy affair&quot; due to the &quot;elderly&quot; engine. Some reviewers, however, felt the game&#x27;s charm made the engine&#x27;s age irrelevant. Reviewers also encountered several software bugs and glitches, among them incompatibility with Windows 2000 and a bug forcing the player to repeat a sequence near the end several times. However, they differed in their opinions of the game as a result of them, ranging from &quot;nearly unplayable&quot; to &quot;a flawed classic.&quot; Reviewers also criticized the game&#x27;s restricted display resolution choices; players could only choose from two options at polar ends of hardware requirements.

== Legacy ==
Before releasing &quot;Anachronox&quot;, Ion Storm retextured characters and adapted sequences from the game for &quot;Shiner&quot;, a production by the Undermain Theatre. Scenes from the game were used to illustrate the vivid imagination and struggles of a paralyzed woman named Xela. &quot;Anachronox&quot; references the films &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; and &quot;Barton Fink&quot; through street addresses on planet Anachronox; Tom Hall had studied acting at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and volunteered as an usher for Undermain. Though received well, the game did not prevent the closure of Ion Storm&#x27;s Dallas office in July 2001; John Romero and Tom Hall departed after its release. The game became &quot;semi-obscure&quot;; Tom Hall explained: &quot;Millions were spent making it, and upon release, $50,000 (~$ in ) advertising it.&quot; He reflected on the game in 2007:

Vice published a 2021 retrospective on the development of &quot;Anachronox&quot;, with the development team fondly remembering Hall&#x27;s leadership. Vice concluded that &quot;Anachronox&quot; was an &quot;unqualified success&quot;, writing that Tom Hall successfully translated the 2D console JRPG experience into a 3D PC game whose adult themes, varied gameplay, and unique dialogue fully realized his &quot;ridiculously ambitious&quot; vision. Hall later reflected, &quot;There are many sadder stories than this one...we got our games out.&quot;

=== Machinima film ===
Cinematic director Jake Hughes independently combined the game&#x27;s cut-scenes into a two-and-a-half-hour film titled &quot;Anachronox: The Movie&quot;, released as 13 MPEG files on Machinima.com. The work was considered machinima&#x27;s first feature-length production (incorrectly: the longer film &quot;The Seal of Nehahra&quot; predates it) and one of its most ambitious projects. Judges at the 2002 Machinima Film Festival (MFF) awarded it Best Picture, Best Writing, and Best Technical Achievement. Machinima.com&#x27;s editors said of the film, &quot;&quot;Anachronox: The Movie&quot; is a tour de force, one of the finest Machinima films produced to date, and probably the most accomplished Machinima feature to date. Hell, it managed to hold two overworked jury members in a room for two and a half hours before the MFF 2002—what more can we say?&quot; As of 2003, Machinima.com planned to release the film on DVD with extra footage and artwork. In 2006, the DVD images got distributed via BitTorrent.

=== Sequel ===
Tom Hall felt the story of &quot;Anachronox&quot; was too large for one game (requiring an estimated 70 hours of gameplay), and planned for two expansion packs in 1998. Each expansion pack would represent another third of the overall story. He confirmed in 1999 that &quot;Anachronox&quot; would be followed by only one sequel; several art assets had already been created for the sequel by mid-2000. Hall speculated in 2000 that further adventures in two new universes may take place after the sequel. Ion Storm&#x27;s closure nixed plans for a continuation; Hall has unsuccessfully tried to purchase the intellectual property rights to the &quot;Anachronox&quot; universe. He later stated that he did not regret ending &quot;Anachronox&quot; on a cliffhanger, as most characters had resolved their inner turmoil.

Hall noted in 2007 that other team members were willing to come back to help: &quot;We went through such turmoil but stayed for the love of the universe, the game and each other. Former team members often mention that if I ever got the intellectual property back and was going to make &quot;Anachronox 2&quot;, just tell them when and where. We have, as we say, &#x27;The Love. Hall remarked in 2010, &quot;If I don&#x27;t do the game in the next 10 years, I&#x27;ll just write up the rest of the story and put it on my website for closure, how about that?&quot;.

On February 17, 2015, Square Enix announced that it will allow developers to create games based on some of their old Eidos IPs via the Square Enix Collective project, including the &quot;Anachronox&quot; IP.

<text>Henry Campbell Bellingham, Baron Bellingham (born 29 March 1955) is a British Conservative politician who sits in the House of Lords and former barrister. He was first elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for North West Norfolk in 1983. He lost his seat in 1997, but regained it in 2001 and retained it until standing down in 2019.

He was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Asia and the Pacific on 14 May 2010, a position he held until 5 September 2012.

==Early life==
Bellingham was born on 29 March 1955 in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. He was privately educated at Wellesley House School in the town of Broadstairs in Kent, followed by Eton College in Berkshire. He went on to study at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he received a law degree in 1977. During his time at Cambridge, he was a member of Cambridge University Liberal Club and served as Joint Master of the Cambridge University Draghounds.

Bellingham also took a short service commission in the Guards for a year between school and university. He trained at the Inns of Court School of Law, and joined the Middle Temple in 1978 and practised as a barrister for eight years.

Bellingham is variously described as a direct descendant of John Bellingham, Spencer Perceval&#x27;s assassin, or as being from the same family. In 1997 &quot;The Independent&quot; noted the historical coincidence that the general election candidate for the Referendum Party, Roger Percival, claimed to be a descendant of the slain Prime Minister. The paper had correctly predicted that Percival&#x27;s intervention could hand the seat to Labour.

==Parliamentary career==
Bellingham first entered Parliament at the 1983 election after winning the seat for North West Norfolk, having defeated the incumbent MP Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler, who in 1981 was the only Conservative to defect to the newly formed SDP. He held his seat until being defeated during the 1997 election. He contested his former seat at the election in 2001, and won it back. He was re-elected in 2005 with a 9000 vote majority, and again in 2010 with a majority of 14,810. He was re-elected at the 2015 general election and 2017 general election.

Bellingham was appointed as a Shadow Minister for Trade and Industry in July 2002, before becoming an Opposition Whip in May 2005. From November 2006 until the 2010 general election he was a Shadow Minister for the Department of Constitutional Affairs. He won the North West Norfolk seat in the 2010 election, and was appointed a Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the coalition government within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office covering; &#x27;Overseas Territories, Africa, United Nations, economic issues, conflict resolution and climate change&#x27;.

In 2009, whilst debating the Queen&#x27;s speech, he was described as &quot;looking uncomfortable&quot; when MPs joked about his distant ancestor John Bellingham, who assassinated Spencer Perceval. Bellingham later stated: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t bring it up in conversation that I&#x27;m a descendant – or a near-descendant – of a murderer of a prime minister. But I don&#x27;t try to deny it&quot;.

In 2011, he abstained on the military intervention in Libya.

On 29 September 2011, while quoting Bellingham, the &quot;Antigua Observer&quot; described him as the United Kingdom&#x27;s Minister of Overseas Territories.
While in Antigua, Bellingham had commented on the surprise decision of former Premier of Bermuda Ewart Brown to provide asylum to four former Uyghur captives in Guantanamo.

&quot;This is something that we weren&#x27;t consulted on by the last (Brown) administration. We have spoken to the United States about it — it&#x27;s our understanding that the arrangement was not to be permanent and we&#x27;re looking to the US State Department to find a permanent solution. We&#x27;re working with them to try and achieve that.&quot;
Bellingham became Vice-Chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Speedway Racing in July 2015.

In Parliament, he was a member of the Panel of Chairs, the Environment Committee, the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, the Trade &amp; Industry Committee and the High Speed Rail (London – West Midlands) Bill Committee.

Bellingham stood down from parliament in the 2019 general election, telling his constituents he had &quot;agonised&quot; over the decision.

==Business interests==
In 2014, a mining company called Pathfinder Minerals appointed Bellingham as non-executive chairman 18 months after he stopped being Minister for Africa. It was reported that Bellingham was earning £4,000 per month for his work with Pathfinder and that he had lobbied on their behalf whilst working as Minister for Africa. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that the case raised concerns &#x27;of a revolving door between Whitehall and the private sector, with ministers benefiting from contacts they made in office&#x27;. However, there was no suggestion of wrongdoing, and all the work had been declared in line with Parliamentary rules.

As a backbench MP, Bellingham was paid £6,448.25 per month. In The Register of Members&#x27; Financial Interests on 21 January 2019, Bellingham declared additional income amounting to £9,583 per month from four jobs:
*Non-executive director of Developing Markets Associates Ltd, a global consultancy and investment conference organiser – £2,500 a month
*Non-executive chairman of Pathfinder Minerals PLC, an AIM listed mining company – £2,083 per month
*Senior Adviser to J. Stern &amp; Co. LLP, a fund management company – £2,500 per month
*Non-executive chairman of Clifton Africa Ltd, a private company specialising in housing and infrastructure construction in developing countries – £2,500 per month

==Personal life==
Bellingham lives in Congham, which is situated within his former constituency, and London. He married Emma Whiteley in August 1993 in Horsham, and they have one son.

Bellingham employed his wife as his Parliamentary Assistant. The practice of MPs employing family members has been criticised by some sections of the media on the lines that it promotes nepotism. Although MPs who were first elected in 2017 were banned from employing family members, the restriction was not retrospective – meaning that Bellingham&#x27;s employment of his wife was lawful.

==Honours==
Bellingham was knighted in the 2016 New Year Honours for political and parliamentary service by Prime Minister David Cameron.

He was awarded a life peerage in 2020 by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He was created Baron Bellingham, &quot; of Congham in the County of Norfolk&quot;, on 5 November. He made his maiden speech in the budget debate in the Lords on 12 March 2021.

<text>Andrew Francis Bennett (9 March 1939 – 15 December 2024) was a British Labour Party politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Stockport North from 1974 to 1983, and then for Denton and Reddish from 1983 to 2005.

==Early life==
Bennett was born in Barton-upon-Irwell. He attended the William Hulme&#x27;s Grammar School in Whalley Range. He studied at the University of Birmingham gaining a BSocSc (Bachelor of Social Science). A geography teacher from 1960 to 1974, Bennett was elected to Oldham Borough Council in 1964, and served on it until 1974.

==Parliamentary career==
Bennett contested the Knutsford parliamentary seat in 1970 and was elected to Parliament in February 1974 for the marginal constituency of Stockport North, defeating the Conservative incumbent Idris Owen by just 203 votes. Following boundary changes, he was elected MP for Denton and Reddish in 1983. From 1983 to 1988 he served on the Labour front bench as a shadow Education and Science minister. He was chairman of the House of Commons Committee on Statutory Instruments.

Bennett rebelled against the Labour government on various issues, including the privatisation of National Air Traffic Services.

Bennett retired at the 2005 general election, and the seat was held for Labour by Andrew Gwynne.

==Personal life and death==
In 1961, Bennett married Gillian Lawley in Manchester. They had a daughter and two sons. Lawley died on 13 December 2023, at the age of 84. Bennett died after a short illness on 15 December 2024, at the age of 85.

<text>Joseph Edward Benton (born 28 September 1933) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Bootle from 1990 to 2015.

==Early life==
Benton was born in Bootle, Merseyside and was educated at the St Monica&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary School on Aintree Road and Secondary School in Bootle and the Bootle Municipal Technical College (now part of the Hugh Baird College of Further Education).

On leaving school in 1949 he received an apprenticeship as a fitter and turner. He entered National Service in 1955 with the RAF. In 1958 he joined the Pacific Steam Navigation Company as a personnel officer, remaining in this position until 1981. In 1982 he became a personnel manager with Girobank.

He has been a Justice of the Peace on the Bootle Bench since 1969. He was elected to serve as a councillor on Bootle County Borough council in 1970, moving to Sefton Borough Council after local government reform in 1973 and serving until his election to Parliament in 1990. Benton was member for the Derby ward from 1970 to 1991 and Leader of the Council from 1986 before being succeeded by Peter Dowd. Dowd also succeeded Benton as MP for the Bootle constituency in May 2015.

==Parliamentary career==
Bootle saw the death of two young Labour MPs in 1990. Allan Roberts died on 21 March after a long battle with cancer; Benton was on the shortlist to follow him but lost out to Mike Carr who won the by-election on 24 May. Carr died on 20 July as a result of a heart attack just 57 days after his election. Benton won the selection to fight the second by-election in Bootle. He was elected comfortably on 8 November, obtaining 78% of the vote and nearly ten times that of his nearest rival, the Conservative James Clappison. Following the 2001 general election, he held the safest Labour seat in the country.

Benton was appointed as an opposition whip by John Smith in 1994, but was not given a government post by Tony Blair after the 1997 general election.

Benton voted to restrict the availability of abortion, and opposes embryo research and euthanasia. He was also one of fifteen Labour MPs to oppose the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill which equalised the age of consent for homosexual and heterosexual sex. In February 2012, Benton signed a petition sponsored by the Coalition for Marriage which states &quot;I support the legal definition of marriage which is the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. I oppose any attempt to redefine it.&quot;. This aroused opposition in his constituency party, with some members feeling he was not prepared to listen to them, contributing towards a move to deselect him.

In February 2013, Benton voted against the second reading of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. Subsequently, in May 2013 the MP voted against the bill’s third and final reading, opposing the legalisation of same-sex marriage within England and Wales.

On 12 June 2014, Benton announced that he would not be standing again at the next election. This was after a vote taken by his constituency Labour party, which opted to open the selection process rather than automatically re-selecting Benton. His absence from the constituency and frequent work abroad were cited as reasons for members failing to support him.

==Personal life==
He married Doris Wynne in 1959 in Bootle, who died in 2016, and the couple had four daughters. The tip of Benton&#x27;s index finger was bitten off by a dog while out campaigning on 6 May 2010 in his Bootle constituency. He was hospitalised and could not vote in the 2010 general election as a result.

On 21 June 2014, Pope Francis conferred a Knighthood of the Pontifical Equestrian Order of St Gregory the Great (KSG) upon Benton in recognition for the contribution he has made to ecclesiastical and civic life on a local and national level.

<text>Jorwert () is a village in Friesland, in the municipality of Leeuwarden, with a population of 342 in January 2017.

The nickname for inhabitants of Jorwert is &quot;Dweilstikken&quot;, meaning poor people who are dependent of rich ones. The village is built around a central &quot;terp&quot;, a man-made mound between 4 and 8 feet tall built to provide relief from the high tides of the sea before dykes were constructed around the 10th century.

==History==
Before 2018, the village was part of the Littenseradiel municipality and before 1984 it belonged to Baarderadeel municipality.

==Book==
Dutch writer Geert Mak used Jorwert as the hook for his book &quot;Jorwerd: The Death of the Village in late 20th century Europe&quot; () - though the Dutch title &quot;Hoe God verdween uit Jorwerd&quot; translates as &quot;How God disappeared from Jorwerd&quot;. Mak describes the changes that have affected the village over the last century, and writes eloquently about the people and their experiences.

==Church==
The centre of the village is the &quot;Redbad church&quot;, which dates back to the 12th century. The church tower collapsed in 1951, but has since been rebuilt; the action to raise funds for the restoration included an open air play Iepenloftspul Jorwert, which is still held every summer in the garden of the local notary.

<text>Melvin Luther Watt (born August 26, 1945) is an American politician who served as director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency from 2014 to 2019. He was appointed by President Barack Obama. He is a former United States Representative for , from 1993 to 2014. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

A lawyer from Charlotte, North Carolina, Watt served one term as a state senator and was the campaign manager for Charlotte mayor Harvey Gantt.

On May 1, 2013, President Barack Obama nominated Watt to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which, among other agencies, administers or has oversight for the FHA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. The U.S. Senate confirmed Watt on December 10, 2013, and he resigned from the House on January 6, 2014.

On September 27, 2018, Watt was called to testify before Congress about allegations that he had sexually harassed a female employee at the Federal Housing Finance Agency. On November 29, 2018, Watt was found guilty of two counts of misconduct. He ended his term as director on January 6, 2019, and issued the following quote: &quot;In my view, it&#x27;s time for me to ride off into the sunset because the standards have become so confused that it&#x27;s difficult to operate in them,&quot; he said, according to a transcript of his interview with investigators.

==Early life, education and career==
Watt was born in Steele Creek, located in Mecklenburg County. He is the son of Evelyn Lucille (&quot;née&quot; Mauney) and Graham Edward Watt.

Watt is a graduate of York Road High School in Charlotte. He was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1967 with a B.S. degree in Business Administration. In 1970, he received a J.D. from Yale Law School and was a published member of the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;.

==Early career==
Watt practiced law from 1970 to 1992, specializing in minority business and economic development law. He has been a partner in several small businesses.

Watt was the campaign manager of Harvey Gantt&#x27;s campaigns for mayor of Charlotte and for the United States Senate election in North Carolina in 1990. Watt served as a member of the North Carolina Senate from January 1985 to January 1987.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

In 1992, Watt entered the Democratic primary for the newly created 12th District, a 64 percent black-majority district stretching from Gastonia to Durham. He won the four-way Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district—with 47 percent of the vote. He then easily won the general election by defeating Barbara Gore Washington (R) and Curtis Wade Krumel (L) with 70 percent of the vote, becoming the first Democrat to represent a significant portion of Charlotte since 1953. In 1993, the original version of his district was thrown out in &quot;Shaw v. Reno,&quot; and was reconfigured to exclude its far western and far eastern portions. The new 12th, however, was no less Democratic than its predecessor, and Watt was reelected 10 more times. He only faced one relatively close race against Republican Scott Keadle.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Financial Services
**Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit
**Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing and Community Opportunity
*Committee on the Judiciary
**Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law
**Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition, and the Internet (Ranking Member)

He previously served on the Joint Economic Committee.

===Caucus memberships===
*Congressional Black Caucus
**(Watt was unanimously elected and served as the Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus 2005–2006.)
*Congressional Progressive Caucus
*International Conservation Caucus

===Legislative history===
In 2010, Watt sponsored the Coin Modernization, Oversight, and Continuity Act.
In 2011, Watt became a co-sponsor of Bill H.R.3261, otherwise known as the Stop Online Piracy Act.
In 2013, Watts supported the Amash–Conyers Amendment, and was against the Innovation Act.

==Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency==

===Nomination and confirmation===
On May 1, 2013, President Obama announced his intent to nominate Watt to serve as the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Almost immediately, the nomination drew criticism from Republicans, some of whom complained that no politician should lead the agency. Other Republican senators have argued that he lacks technical expertise on housing finance. Obama formally nominated Watt to the post on May 7, 2013.

In July 2013, the Senate Banking Committee advanced Watt&#x27;s nomination on a party-line vote.

On October 28, 2013, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid motioned to invoke cloture on Watt&#x27;s nomination, setting up a key test of whether his nomination could overcome procedural hurdles and move to a final up-or-down vote. The motion failed on October 31, with 56 votes in favor, shy of the 60 needed to pass.

After a series of procedural votes on December 10, 2013, the Senate voted 57–40 to invoke cloture on Watt&#x27;s nomination, ending the Republican filibuster under the Senate&#x27;s recently modified rules for cloture on executive branch nominees. Later that same day, the Senate confirmed Watt in a 57–41 vote.

Watt was investigated in July 2018 for sexually harassing an employee. 
==Controversies==

===Accusation by Ralph Nader of use of &quot;racial epithet&quot; ===
In 2004, Ralph Nader attended a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus, at which Nader clashed with members of the caucus over his presidential bid. After the meeting, Nader alleged that Watt twice uttered an &quot;obscene racial epithet&quot; towards him. It was alleged that Watt said: &quot;You&#x27;re just another arrogant white man — telling us what we can do — it&#x27;s all about your ego — another fucking arrogant white man.&quot; Although Nader (who is of Lebanese descent) wrote a letter to the Caucus and to Watt asking for an apology, none was offered.

===Opposition to Federal Reserve auditing===
In 2009, fellow congressman Ron Paul reported to Bloomberg that while Paul&#x27;s bill HR 1207, which mandates an audit of the Federal Reserve, was in subcommittee, Watt had substantially altered the substance of the bill, a move which had &quot;gutted&quot; the bill&#x27;s protections. According to Bloomberg News, on October 20, 2009, &quot;The bill, with 308 co-sponsors, has been stripped of provisions that would remove Fed exemptions from audits of transactions with foreign central banks, monetary policy deliberations, transactions made under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and communications between the Board, the reserve banks and staff, Paul said today.&quot; Paul said there is &quot;nothing left&quot; in the bill after Watt&#x27;s actions.

Paul responded when he and Alan Grayson of Florida passed a competing amendment hours before the bill cleared the House Financial Services Committee to restore the bill&#x27;s original language and undo Watt&#x27;s attempts to weaken its effects. Watt won support from Chairman Barney Frank of Massachusetts and the Congressional Black Caucus, both of which backed his amendment. Eight of the ten Black Caucus members on the committee voted against the Paul-Grayson amendment. Watt and Frank voted to inhibit the bill&#x27;s approval. With pressure from the Congressional Black Caucus to delay consideration of the bill by the full House of Representatives, it is unclear when HR 1207 will face a final vote.

The country&#x27;s largest bank Bank of America is headquartered in Charlotte in Watt&#x27;s congressional district and has threatened to leave. The Sunlight Foundation reported that 45% of Watt&#x27;s campaign contributions for 2009 are from corporations in the real estate, insurance and finance industries, the seventh-highest percentage of any member of Congress. Watt&#x27;s largest contributors included American Express, Wachovia, Bank of America and the American Bankers Association.

===Support of SOPA===

Congressman Watt ardently supports the Stop Online Piracy Act, stating that it is &quot;beyond troubling to hear hyperbolic charges that this bill will open the floodgates to government censorship&quot;.

===Ethics investigation===
Congressman Watt was formally investigated by the Office of Congressional Ethics over a series of fundraising events he was involved in. On December 9, 2009, Watt held a fundraiser and soon after withdrew a proposal he had introduced to subject auto dealers to more stringent regulations. The fundraiser brought donors mainly from large finance companies such as Goldman Sachs. Watt was later cleared of charges or wrongdoing.

In what the nonpartisan Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) called &quot;disgraceful&quot;, Watt introduced legislation to slash funding for the Office of Congressional Ethics.

===Racial gerrymandering===
In 1993, the design of his district was challenged as an instance of racial gerrymandering. The Supreme Court held in &quot;Shaw v. Reno&quot; that the unusual shape of the district required strict scrutiny of its racial purpose. Although it is rare for a law to survive strict scrutiny, the districting plan was upheld on remand as &quot;narrowly tailored to further the state&#x27;s compelling interest in complying with the Voting Rights Act&quot;.

==Political campaigns==
In 1992, Watt was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from North Carolina&#x27;s newly created 12th Congressional District and became one of only two African American members elected to Congress from North Carolina in the 20th century, the other being Eva M. Clayton.

<doc id="414632" wikidata="Q263147" url="?curid=414632" title="John Bercow">
<text>John Simon Bercow (; born 19 January 1963) is a British former politician who served as Speaker of the House of Commons from 2009 to 2019, and Member of Parliament (MP) for Buckingham between 1997 and 2019. A member of the Conservative Party prior to becoming Speaker, he was the first MP since Selwyn Lloyd in 1971 to be elected Speaker without having been a Deputy Speaker. After resigning as Speaker in 2019 and opting not to seek re-election as MP for Buckingham in the 2019 general election, Bercow left Parliament. In 2021, he joined the Labour Party but was suspended in 2022.

Bercow was a councillor in the London Borough of Lambeth from 1986 to 1990 and unsuccessfully contested parliamentary seats in the 1987 and 1992 general elections, before being elected for Buckingham in 1997. Promoted to the Shadow cabinet in 2001, he held posts under Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard. In November 2002, Bercow resigned over a dispute concerning his support for the Adoption and Children Act 2002, but returned a year later, only to be dismissed from the Shadow cabinet in 2004. Having initially been strongly associated with the right-wing faction of his party, his views shifted; by 2007, there were rumours that he would defect to the Labour Party.

On the resignation of Michael Martin in June 2009, Bercow stood successfully in the election to replace him as Speaker. As Speaker, he was obliged to leave the Conservative Party and remain as an independent for the duration of his tenure. He was re-elected unopposed at the commencements of the Parliaments in 2010, 2015 and 2017. This made him the first Speaker since the Second World War to have been elected four times, as well as the first since then to have served alongside four prime ministers. In September 2019, Bercow declared that he would stand down as Commons Speaker and MP on 31 October; he remained Speaker until being appointed to the Manor of Northstead on 4 November 2019.

In 2014, Bercow was appointed Chancellor of the University of Bedfordshire. In July 2017, he was appointed Chancellor of the University of Essex, stepping down from this role in November 2021. In January 2020, he became part-time professor of politics at Royal Holloway, University of London. He was suspended from the Labour Party in 2022 following reports of him bullying staff. Since the death of Betty Boothroyd in 2023, he is the only living former Speaker of the House of Commons.

== Early life and education ==
On 19 January 1963, John Bercow was born in Edgware, Middlesex, the son of Brenda ( Bailey) and Charles Bercow, a taxi driver. His father was born to a Jewish family and his mother converted to Judaism. His paternal grandparents were Jews who arrived in Britain from Romania in the early 20th century. Having settled in the UK, the family anglicised its surname from Berkowitz to Bercow. Bercow attended Frith Manor Primary School in Woodside Park, and Finchley Manorhill, a large comprehensive school in North Finchley. In his youth, Bercow was a successful junior tennis player, but was too short to turn professional. In 1975 he appeared on the UK children&#x27;s television series &quot;Crackerjack!&quot;.

Bercow graduated with a first-class honours degree in government from the University of Essex in 1985. Anthony King, a professor at the university, has said about Bercow that &quot;When he was a student here, he was very right-wing, pretty stroppy, and very good. He was an outstanding student.&quot; As a young activist, Bercow was a member of the right-wing Conservative Monday Club. He stood as a candidate for the club&#x27;s national executive in 1981 with a manifesto calling for a programme of &quot;assisted repatriation&quot; of immigrants, and became secretary of its immigration and repatriation committee. However, at the age of 20 he left the club, citing the views of many of the club&#x27;s members as his reason, and has since then called his participation in the club &quot;utter madness&quot; and dismissed his views from that period as &quot;bone headed&quot;.

After graduating from the University of Essex, Bercow was elected as the last national chairman of the Federation of Conservative Students (FCS), 1986–87. The FCS was then broken up by the chairman of the Conservative Party, Norman Tebbit, after one of its members had accused previous Tory PM Harold Macmillan of war crimes in extraditing Cossacks to the Soviet Union. Bercow attracted the attention of the Conservative leadership, and in 1987 he was appointed by Tebbit as vice-chairman of the Conservative Collegiate Forum (the successor organisation of the FCS) to head the campaign for student support in the run-up to the 1987 general election.

After a spell in merchant banking, Bercow joined the lobbying firm Rowland Sallingbury Casey (part of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi) in 1988, becoming a board director within five years. With fellow Conservative Julian Lewis, Bercow ran an advanced speaking and campaigning course for over 10 years, which trained over 600 Conservatives (including several current MPs) in campaigning and communication techniques. He has also lectured in the United States to students of the Leadership Institute.

== Political career ==

=== Councillor ===
In 1986, Bercow was elected as a Conservative councillor in the London Borough of Lambeth and served for four years representing the Streatham, St Leonard&#x27;s ward. In 1987, he was appointed the youngest deputy group leader in the United Kingdom.

=== Special adviser ===
In 1995, Bercow was appointed as a special adviser to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Jonathan Aitken. Following Aitken&#x27;s resignation to fight a libel action, Bercow served as a special adviser to the Secretary of State for National Heritage, Virginia Bottomley.

=== Parliamentary career ===

Bercow was an unsuccessful Conservative candidate in the 1987 general election in Motherwell South, and again at the 1992 general election in Bristol South. In 1996 he paid £1,000 to charter a helicopter so that he could attend the selection meetings for two safe Conservative parliamentary seats on the same day – Buckingham and Surrey Heath – and was selected as the candidate for Buckingham. He has referred to the hiring of the helicopter as &quot;the best £1,000 I have ever spent&quot;.

Bercow was first elected to parliament in the 1997 general election as the MP for Buckingham with a majority of 12,386. He then increased his majority at the 2001 general election being elected by a margin of 13,325 votes. He was re-elected at the 2005 general election with an again increased majority of 18,129.

Bercow devoted a notable portion of his maiden speech to praising former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher whom he called &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest living statesman.&quot; In 1999, the &quot;Almanac of British Politics&quot; described him as an &quot;articulate, abrasive and waspish Commons performer&quot; who Tony Blair had labelled as &quot;nasty and ineffectual in equal quantity&quot; for an attack he had made on Robin Cook.

Bercow rose quickly through the opposition&#x27;s junior offices. He was appointed a frontbench spokesman for Education and Employment in June 1999, and then a frontbench spokesman for Home Affairs in July 2000, before being brought into the shadow cabinet in 2001 by the Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith. He served as Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury from September 2001 to July 2002, and as Shadow Spokesperson for Work and Pensions from July to November 2002. During this first spell on the front benches, Bercow publicly said that he did not think he was ruthless enough to reach the top of politics. In November 2002, when the Labour government introduced the Adoption and Children Act, which would allow unmarried gay and heterosexual couples to adopt children, Duncan Smith imposed a three-line whip requiring Conservative MPs to vote against the bill, rather than allowing a free vote. Arguing that it should be a free vote, Bercow defied the whips and voted with Labour, then resigned from the front bench. As a backbencher he was openly critical of Duncan Smith&#x27;s leadership.

In November 2003, the new Conservative leader Michael Howard appointed Bercow as Shadow Secretary of State for International Development. However, he went on to clash with Howard over taxes, immigration and Iraq, and was sacked from the front bench in September 2004 after telling Howard that Ann Widdecombe was right to have said that there was &quot;something of the night about him&quot;. Bercow has a long-standing interest in Burma and frequently raised issues of democracy and genocide in the country. In 2006, he was a patron of the Tory Reform Group. In 2001, he supported the ban on MPs becoming members of the Monday Club.

Bercow was formerly the treasurer of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Tribal Peoples, an APPG composed of over 30 cross-party MPs which aims to raise parliamentary and public awareness of tribal peoples.

Bercow won the Stonewall award for Politician of the Year in 2010 for his work to support equality for lesbian, gay and bisexual people. Stonewall gave him a score of 100% for always voting for its position on gay equality issues in parliament between 2007 and 2009.

=== Opposition MP of the Year ===
In 2005, Bercow won the Channel Four/Hansard Society Political Award for &#x27;Opposition MP of the Year&#x27;. He said:
In addition to pursuing a wide variety of local issues, I have attempted to question, probe and scrutinise the Government in the House of Commons on important national and international topics which concern people. Over the last 12 months, I have constantly pressed the case for reform of world trade rules to give the poorest people on the planet a chance to sell their products and improve their quality of life. The plight of the people of Darfur, Western Sudan, has also been a regular theme. They have suffered too much for too long with too little done about the situation. I shall go on arguing for Britain to take the lead in the international community in seeking decisive action for peace and justice.

=== Rumours of defection ===
Following the defection of Conservative MP Quentin Davies to the Labour Party in June 2007, there were persistent rumours that Bercow was likely to be the next Conservative MP to leave the party.

Bercow did not at that time defect to Labour, but in September 2007, accepted an advisory post on Gordon Brown&#x27;s government&#x27;s review of support for children with speech, language and communication special needs. The Conservative Party chairman, Caroline Spelman, confirmed that this appointment was with the consent of the Conservative Party. Bercow had a long-term interest in this topic, as his son Oliver has been diagnosed with autism.

=== Bercow review ===
In 2008, Bercow was asked by Labour cabinet members Ed Balls and Alan Johnson to produce a substantial review of children and families affected by speech, language and communication needs (SLCN). After the report, the government pledged £52 million to raise the profile of SLCN within the education field. The review looks at the extreme consequences to which communication problems can lead; from initial frustration at not being able to express oneself, to bullying or being bullied at school, fewer job prospects and even a descent into criminality.

The interim report highlighted a number of core issues: that speech, language and communication are not only essential life skills but fundamental human rights; that early identification of problems and intervention is important to avoid social problems later on; and that the current system of treatment was patchy, i.e. there was a need for services to be continually provided for children and families from an early age.

=== Role in expenses scandal ===

During the 2009 expenses scandal, it was revealed that Bercow changed the designation of his second home on more than one occasion – meaning that he avoided paying capital gains tax on the sale of two properties. He also claimed just under £1,000 to hire an accountant to fill in his tax returns. Bercow denied any wrongdoing, but agreed to pay £6,508 plus VAT to cover any tax that he may have had to pay to HM Revenue and Customs.

It was revealed in 2014 that the House of Commons authorities had destroyed all evidence of MPs&#x27; expenses claims prior to 2010. Bercow faced accusations that he had presided over what had been dubbed a &quot;fresh cover-up&quot; of the expenses scandal.

In July 2015, Bercow was again criticised for the amount of his expenses, including a claim of £172 for a chauffeur-driven journey. Andy Silvester, campaign director at the TaxPayers&#x27; Alliance, said: &quot;This is an obscene waste of money and shows appalling judgment from whoever made the arrangements.&quot;

=== Charitable work ===
Bercow has supported a number of charities. He has been a patron of the ME Association, Brain Tumour Research and a patron of the Patchwork Foundation, which promotes the positive integration of disadvantaged and minority communities into British democracy and civil society and which was founded by Harris Bokhari. He also spoken at a fundraising event for the mental health charity Jami. In 2018, Bercow supported a fundraiser for Children in Need.

== Speaker of the House of Commons ==

=== Election and first term ===

Bercow had long campaigned quietly to become Speaker and was touted as a successor to Michael Martin. On 20 May 2009, he officially declared to stand in the speakership election, which had been triggered by Martin&#x27;s resignation and launched his manifesto for the job. In reference to his decision to stand, Bercow said: &quot;I wanted it because I felt that there was a task to be undertaken and that&#x27;s about strengthening backbench involvement and opportunity in parliament, and helping parliament get off its knees and recognise that it isn&#x27;t just there as a rubber-stamping operation for the government of the day, and as necessary and appropriate to contradict and expose the government of the day.&quot;

In the first round of the election on 22 June, Bercow received 179 votes – more than any other candidate, but short of the majority required for victory. In the third and final round of voting later that day, he defeated George Young by 322 votes to 271, and was approved by the Queen at 10 pm that night as the 157th Speaker. In accordance with convention, he rescinded his Conservative Party membership. Bercow was elected by a large number of Labour votes, many MPs being driven by the perception that Michael Martin had been hounded out of the job and wanting his replacement to be someone who was not a Conservative Party favourite.

Bercow was the first Speaker to be Jewish, the first one to have been elected by an exhaustive ballot, and the first not to wear traditional court robes while presiding over the House of Commons. However, in accordance with tradition, Bercow did display his coat of arms at Speaker&#x27;s House.

==== Speaker&#x27;s residence refurbishment ====
Within weeks of taking office as Speaker, Bercow ordered a redecoration and refurbishment of the Speaker&#x27;s grace and favour apartment in the Palace of Westminster, partly with the objective of making it child-friendly; the work cost £20,659 and was paid for by Parliament. It followed extensive work on the apartment under the previous Speaker.

==== Youth Parliament ====
In October 2009, Bercow chaired the United Kingdom Youth Parliament&#x27;s first annual sitting in the House of Commons, making them the only group except members of parliament to sit in the chamber. He chaired every subsequent sitting and attended every annual conference until his resignation in 2019, addressing and supporting Members of Youth Parliament from across the UK.

=== 2010 general election and second term ===
The Speaker of the House of Commons is traditionally seen as outside party politics and is often not challenged by the main parties at general elections, including the 2010 general election. In September 2009, Nigel Farage resigned his leadership of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) to stand for Bercow&#x27;s Buckingham seat, asserting, &quot;This man represents all that is wrong with British politics today. He was embroiled in the expenses saga and he presides over a Parliament that virtually does nothing.&quot; John Stevens, another candidate, found support for his campaign from the former Independent MP Martin Bell. Bercow also faced opposition from the British National Party and the Christian Party.

As Bercow lacked a party endorsement and therefore a campaign team, he sought to build one. A group of his supporters known as &#x27;Friends of Speaker Bercow&#x27; solicited donations for the campaign, aiming to raise £40,000. When one of their letters was received by a member of UKIP, the recipient referred it to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, complaining that it appeared that Bercow&#x27;s fundraising campaign was operating from the Speaker&#x27;s Office, which is required to remain politically neutral. The Commissioner declined to launch an investigation because of the lack of evidence.

==== Speaker&#x27;s Lectures ====
To mark the centenary of the Parliament Act 1911, Bercow commissioned a series of lectures about the main political figures of the century. The Speaker&#x27;s Lectures continue with a variety of topics such as historic parliamentarians and current affairs.

=== 2015 general election and third term ===
Bercow won the most votes in Buckingham. In his victory speech, he addressed the issue of the 1289 spoilt ballot papers that were counted in the constituency.

On 26 March 2015, the House of Commons defeated a government motion (introduced by former Conservative party leader and then leader of the House of Commons William Hague) to require a secret ballot on whether Bercow would remain speaker after the 2015 general election. A number of MPs described it as an underhand plot to oust Bercow, largely based on the timing of the motion just before the dissolution of Parliament when some Labour MPs expected to oppose it had already returned to their constituencies. In the event, Bercow was re-elected unopposed as Speaker following the general election.

In February 2017, Bercow said he had supported continued membership of the European Union in the 2016 referendum.

On 6 February 2017, Bercow said in the house that he would be &quot;strongly opposed&quot; to US President Donald Trump addressing the Houses of Parliament during his planned state visit to the UK, and told MPs that &quot;opposition to racism and sexism&quot; were &quot;hugely important considerations&quot;. The comments proved controversial and made the headlines in many UK newspapers the following day, with some such as &quot;Guardian&quot; columnist Owen Jones, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Labour MP Dennis Skinner and Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron supporting this intervention. His comments were criticised by some opponents of Trump, such as Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi, for being hypocritical and undermining the Speaker&#x27;s neutrality, and some in the government reportedly felt that Bercow had overstepped his role. John Whittingdale, the Conservative MP for Maldon and a former Culture Secretary, dismissed Bercow&#x27;s remarks as &quot; for as much publicity as possible&quot;, and Bercow himself apologised to the Lord Speaker Lord Fowler over a lack of consultation over his remarks.

=== 2017 general election and fourth term ===
Following the 2017 general election, Bercow was re-elected unopposed as Speaker of the House by members of parliament on 13 June 2017.

==== Brexit ====
In January 2019, Bercow broke with convention, allowing a vote on an amendment to a government business motion. The amendment, tabled by Dominic Grieve MP, required Prime Minister Theresa May to table a motion within three days on proposed alternative plans if her Brexit deal was rejected by Parliament.

On 18 March 2019, Bercow, in a statement to the House, pre-empted a move by the Government to bring the UK/EU Withdrawal Agreement for a third vote. Citing a convention which dates back to 1604, Bercow stated that he would not allow a vote on a motion which was &quot;substantially the same&quot; as a previously rejected motion.

During the Brexit debates throughout that year, his particular speaking style and calls for order got widespread attention in viral videos on social media outside the U.K. &quot;I apparently say it in a way that amuses some people. I suspect it&#x27;s some interest in what is regarded as English eccentricity.,&quot; he told &quot;Der Spiege&quot;l in April 2019. &quot;I inherited my speaking style from my late father. It obviously provokes comment. Some people say, &quot;Oh, we like the way he speaks.&quot; And other people say, &quot;That bloke&#x27;s an irritating clot, he&#x27;s horrible.&quot; Well, my argument is that I&#x27;m authentic. And I&#x27;m just being me. It&#x27;s not a contrivance. It&#x27;s not a put-on show. It&#x27;s the way I am.&quot; He told CBS&#x27; &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in fall 2019 that &quot;quite quickly my wife and kids drew my attention to the fact that they saw on the internet that there was a lot of interest in other countries.&quot;

==Retirement as Speaker and career after parliament==

Having served 10 years as Speaker, Bercow became the longest-serving Speaker since Edward FitzRoy, who served nearly 15 years in post between 1928 and 1943.

In October 2018, it was reported that Bercow intended to step down as Speaker in the summer of 2019, but in January 2019 it was reported that he planned to stay as Speaker until the end of the parliament, in 2022. On 9 September 2019, amid debates about Brexit and parliament being prorogued, Bercow declared to the House of Commons that he would stand down on 31 October, or at the next general election, whichever was sooner; the former applied.

Despite the convention that former Speakers of the House of Commons are elevated to membership of the House of Lords when they resign, the Prime Minister denied Bercow a peerage because it was perceived that he had not maintained political neutrality in office and would not be politically neutral in the House of Lords as convention requires. Sources in the Cabinet had suggested beforehand that this would be due to his rulings during the Parliamentary votes on Brexit, which the Government saw as biased against them. Bercow became the first ex-Speaker since the retirement of Arthur Onslow in 1761 to have been eligible for, but not have been made the offer of, a peerage. Overall, he is the tenth Speaker not to receive a Peerage since the 1707 Act of Union, and the fifth since Onslow&#x27;s retirement not to be immediately elevated to the House of Lords: Charles Wolfran Cornwall died in office with no peerage offer to his surviving family, John Henry Whitley was offered but declined, and following the deaths of Edward FitzRoy and Sir Harry Hylton-Foster in office, their widows were ennobled instead. With no prospect of a government-sponsored peerage, Bercow lobbied the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, in the hope that the opposition might give him preferment.

In November 2019, Bercow retired from the Commons (using the Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead mechanism: since members of the House of Commons are prohibited from resigning, the legal device of appointment to an &quot;office of profit under The Crown&quot; is used to permit members to leave their legislative offices).

In the same month, Bercow stated that he &quot;think[s] that Brexit is the biggest foreign policy mistake in the post-war period, and that is my honest view.&quot; This led to further questions about Bercow&#x27;s impartiality during the Brexit parliamentary debates. He maintained that he was impartial during the debates, and only made his views clear after leaving office.

He joined Sky News for its election night coverage of the 2019 United Kingdom general election on December 12, 2019. Later that month, he delivered the Alternative Christmas message on Channel 4.

His autobiography, &quot;&quot;, was published in 2020. In his memoirs, he was highly critical of David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Andrea Leadsom. Bercow has since identified himself as a soft leftist and declared that he voted for Sadiq Khan to be Mayor of London. He was also nominated for a peerage by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, but this was refused by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Bercow has also been very critical of the British government response to the COVID-19 pandemic since leaving Parliament.

On 19 June 2021, Bercow said that he had joined the Labour Party &quot;a few weeks ago&quot;. He said Boris Johnson&#x27;s Conservative Party was &quot;reactionary, populist, nationalistic and sometimes even xenophobic.&quot; He said his move to Labour was motivated by his &quot;support for equality, social justice and internationalism. That is the Labour brand.&quot;

While Bercow originally &quot;proposed before he leaves office to waive his entitlement to the Speaker&#x27;s pension until he reaches the age of 65&quot;, in 2021 he revealed he started taking the pension when he left the office, after speaking with his wife.

Bercow has participated in a number of &quot;celebrity&quot; and reality TV shows in Britain and the US.

In 2024, Bercow provided the voice of the Robot Speaker of the House of Commons in the &quot;Fallout&quot; mod &quot;&quot;.

== Bullying of office staff ==
In May 2018, Bercow&#x27;s former private secretary Angus Sinclair alleged on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme that Bercow had repeatedly bullied him while at work. Sinclair said that he was told to sign a non-disclosure agreement when he left his post, to prevent him revealing Bercow&#x27;s bullying. Bercow denied the claims. Sinclair&#x27;s allegations came not long after the BBC reported that his successor as Bercow&#x27;s private secretary, Kate Emms, had been signed off work and then moved to another role. Unnamed colleagues of Emms had told the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme that her sickness and change of role were because of bullying by Bercow.

In October 2018, Bercow called for an independent body to be set up to investigate allegations of harassment and bullying in Parliament. He faced calls to quit after an independent report by Dame Laura Cox found that harassment and bullying had been tolerated and concealed for years, which Bercow denies. On 23 October 2018, three Conservative MPs, Will Quince, Mims Davies and Anne Milton, resigned from the Commons Reference Group on Representation and Inclusion, which is chaired by Bercow, and cited Bercow&#x27;s handling of bullying and sexual harassment allegations in Parliament as the reason for doing so.

In January 2020, Lord Lisvane, who served as Clerk of the House of Commons under Bercow, submitted a formal complaint to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. In the same month Lisvane&#x27;s complaint was followed up by a further accusation of bullying, made by the former Black Rod, Lieutenant-General David Leakey.

In January 2022, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Stone, upheld 21 allegations out of 35 brought by Lord Lisvane and private secretaries Kate Emms and Angus Sinclair against Bercow, who appealed to the Independent Expert Panel.

In March 2022, the Independent Expert Panel upheld the findings of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, concluding that Bercow had &quot;been widely unreliable and repeatedly dishonest in his evidence&quot;, a &quot;serial liar&quot; and a &quot;serial bully&quot;. Formally reprimanding Bercow, the Panel recommended that, as he was no longer a Member of Parliament and could not, therefore, be expelled from the House of Commons, &quot;he should never be permitted a pass to the Parliamentary estate&quot;. The Labour Party subsequently suspended him from the party. Bercow rejected the Panel&#x27;s findings and declared the body⁠—which included a former Lord Justice of Appeal and a former Chief Coroner⁠—to be a &quot;kangaroo court&quot; lacking in legal expertise. Lisvane dismissed Bercow&#x27;s rejection as &quot;hysterical petulance from someone caught bang to rights&quot;. As a result, Bercow was suspended from the Labour Party.

==Personal life==
Bercow married Sally Illman in 2002 after 13 years of an &quot;on-off&quot; relationship, and they have three children. Their elder son, Oliver, is autistic. Sally had an affair with Bercow&#x27;s cousin in 2015 but she later returned to the marriage; Bercow said he bore some responsibility for the affair by not providing enough time for his wife. His wife, who used to be a Conservative, switched to supporting the Labour Party, campaigning for both her husband individually and Labour in the wider election in 1997. Bercow and those close to him reject the view that she was especially influential in changing his political views. Both he and his wife are teetotallers. 

Bercow is a humanist, and before taking the role of Speaker was a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Humanist Group. When discussing the role of clergy in Parliament, he described himself in a Commons debate as &quot;an irreligious person taking a secular interest in an important subject&quot;.

Bercow has been a fan of Arsenal F.C. since January 1971 and is a season ticket holder. He always attends games with his son and has appeared on AFTV. Bercow is also a lifelong follower of tennis, having played competitively against the likes of Andrew Castle and Jeremy Bates in his youth. His book on the sport, &quot;Tennis Maestros: The Twenty Greatest Male Tennis Players of All Time,&quot; was published in 2014 by Biteback Publishing.

Bercow and his wife are directors and shareholders of Fedhead Limited, an &quot;information service company&quot;.

<text>Radio comedy, or comedic radio programming, is a radio broadcast that may involve variety show, sitcom elements, sketches, and various types of comedy found in other media. It may also include more surreal or fantastic elements, as these can be conveyed on a small budget with just a few sound effects or some simple dialogue. Radio comedy began in the United States in 1930, based on the fact that as most United Kingdom music hall comedians such as Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel progressed to silent films, they moved to Hollywood and fed the radio comedy field. Another British music hall comic, George Formby, stayed in the British movie industry, and in 1940 joined the Entertainments National Service Association to entertain British World War II troops. UK radio comedy therefore started later, in the 1950s.

Radio comedy began in the United States in 1930, and got a much later start in the United Kingdom because many of the British comedians (such as Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel) emigrated to the U.S. to make silent movies in Hollywood, and the American comedians who did not become dramatic actors migrated to radio. Raymond Knight launched &quot;The Cuckoo Hour&quot; on NBC in 1930, along with the 1931 network debut of Stoopnagle and Budd on CBS. Comedians such as Fred Allen, Jack Benny, Judy Canova, Bob Hope and Red Skelton were top-rated in the decades that followed. Even after the big name comedians moved to television in the 1950s, radio comedy continued, notably from Bob and Ray (1946–1988), The Firesign Theatre (1966–1972), and segments heard on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Monitor&quot; (1955–1975).

Radio comedy did not begin in the United Kingdom until a generation later, with such popular 1950s shows as &quot;The Goon Show&quot; (started 1951) and &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; (started 1957). Later, radio became a proving-ground for many later United Kingdom comedians. Chris Morris began his career in 1986 at Radio Cambridgeshire, and Ricky Gervais began his comedy career in 1997 at London radio station XFM.

Although traditional comedy was once a significant part of American broadcast radio programming, it is now mainly found in the archives of Old Time Radio enthusiasts and on the Internet streaming of comedy recordings. The majority of mainstream radio comedy now consists of personality-driven shows hosted by talk-radio hosts such as Howard Stern or comedic duos such as Armstrong &amp; Getty and Bob &amp; Tom. Exceptions to this are WSRN&#x27;s &quot;Audience of Two&quot;, Garrison Keillor&#x27;s work on Minnesota Public Radio: &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; and &quot;Comedy College&quot;, and NPR&#x27;s &quot;Car Talk&quot;, a comedy show thinly disguised as car advice, and &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;. Shows featuring comedic music are also popular; one of the better known national comedy music programs is the long-running weekly program hosted by Dr. Demento, and several other local stations (mostly college radio, freeform and eclectic formats) have similar programs. Several networks program 24 hours a day of stand-up comedy routines; several channels on the Sirius XM Radio platforms focus on this format, as does the terrestrial All Comedy Radio network. Rock music stations often play bits of stand-up comedy within the bounds of their regular formats, usually under the banner of a &quot;five o&#x27;clock funnies&quot; feature.

In Britain and Canada, however, the BBC and Canadian Broadcasting Corporation respectively have continued making new radio comedy and drama. British radio comedy also has a home on Australia&#x27;s Radio National and in Ireland there are always a few comedy shows in the week&#x27;s programming on RTÉ. A locally produced Australian comedic radio program is Hamish &amp; Andy, and in the United Kingdom an example is The Burkiss Way.

Radio in Canada is fragmented between the public broadcasters the CBC and Radio Canada in English and French respectively, and a number of independent stations and syndicated networks spread across a very large country. Canadian radio licences are federally managed to limit monopolies. Consequently, programing including comedy, is inconsistent and variable quality. In Toronto Jake Edwards (radio personality) portrayed a punchdrunk boxer known as the Champ who manages to misunderstand social situations and overreact with fisticuffs. Performing musical comedians Maclean and Maclean created foul-mouthed original recordings which became underground hits despite limited airplay due to censorship and legal troubles. The Ottawa market on CHEZ-FM 106.1 featured a pair of Ottawa Valley &quot;lads&quot; or country bumpkins Delmer MacGregor and Cecil Wiggins, played by Gary Perrin and Mike O’Reilly. In real life Perrin was a station executive with little performance training. O&#x27;Reilly was an on-air personality, a seasoned bluegrass musician, and multi-instrumentalist. Together they produced a light comedy album, which included Meadow Muffin Blues about stepping in cow pies in the pasture.

Many of the BBC&#x27;s most successful television comedies began life as BBC Radio 4 shows. These include &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, &quot;Goodness Gracious Me&quot;, &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot;, &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot;, &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, &quot;Room 101&quot;, &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot;, (based on Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The News Quiz&quot;), &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, Mitchell and Webb and The Mighty Boosh, and most recently &quot;Little Britain&quot; and &quot;Absolute Power&quot;. The science fiction comedy &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; was developed from ideas in a radio show called &quot;Son Of Cliché&quot;. Another science fiction comedy &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; was created for radio, but also went on to great success in book, television and film formats.

Examples of American radio comedy can be heard on streaming internet radio stations. Humorous storytelling is the focus of &quot;The Moth Radio Hour&quot;. Garrison Keillor&#x27;s &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; can be heard on public radio stations in the United States and a different version of the shows can be heard on BBC Radio 4 Extra and RTÉ under the name &quot;Garrison Keillor&#x27;s Radio Show&quot;. Old shows can be listened to online at the websites of &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; or RTÉ. British radio comedy can be heard on BBC Radio 4, BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio 4 Extra. Minnesota Public Radio maintains a website where it is possible to listen to episodes of &quot;Comedy College&quot;. A British commercial station Oneword broadcast American vintage radio comedy as part of their 24-hour-a-day programming of books, comedy and drama and this was streamed on the internet until the station closed in 2008.

Interest in radio comedy and radio drama is currently enjoying a resurgence. Epguides.com, which provides encyclopedic information on television shows, has recently begun to build a similar list of radio shows.

In America, new groups have formed to try to bring about a renewed interest in the art-form. At the forefront of this new wave of audio-only comedic groups is &quot;Peeper Radio Theatre&quot;. Veteran NPR Producer Joe Bevilacqua is creating new radio comedy for &quot;The Comedy-O-Rama Hour&quot;, which airs on XM Satellite Radio&#x27;s Sonic Theater Channel 163, five times per week. In the UK, recent standup and revue comedy performances are also now receiving airing on radio.

<doc id="414638" wikidata="Q263243" url="?curid=414638" title="Paul Beresford">
<text>Sir Alexander Paul Beresford (born 6 April 1946) is a British–New Zealander politician who served as the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Mole Valley in Surrey from 1997 to 2024. He previously served as MP for Croydon Central from 1992 to 1997.

==Early life and career==

Alexander Beresford was born on 6 April 1946 in Levin in the Horowhenua District of Manawatū-Whanganui, New Zealand. He moved to Nelson as a child, where he lived in Richmond, and attended Waimea College in Richmond before attending the University of Otago in Dunedin. Beresford holds dual British and New Zealand citizenship.

Beresford was elected as a Councillor to Wandsworth Borough Council in 1978, and was its Leader between 1983 and 1992, through much of the Thatcher Government. He was knighted in the 1990 New Year Honours for political and public service.

In addition to his parliamentary career, Beresford is a practising dentist, operating his own private dental practice – The Beresford Clinic – in Putney, South West London. The practice received adverse publicity following a critical CQC inspection in 2021.

==Parliamentary career==

Beresford was selected to fight the safe Conservative seat of Croydon Central following the retirement of former Cabinet minister John Moore. Beresford was elected at the 1992 general election with 55.4% of the vote and a majority of 9,650. He made his maiden speech on 30 June 1992. 

Beresford entered the Major Government in 1994 as the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for the Environment and remained until the Government was defeated in 1997.

When the number of seats in Croydon was reduced from four to three before the 1997 general election, Beresford failed to be selected for the newly drawn Croydon Central, and instead fought the safe Conservative Mole Valley seat in Surrey, where Kenneth Baker was retiring. At the 1997 general election, Beresford was elected with 48% of the vote and a majority of 10,221. 

Beresford was re-elected at the 2001 general election with an increased vote share of 50.5% and a decreased majority of 10,153. He was again re-elected at the 2005 general election with an increased vote share of 54.8% and an increased majority of 11,997.

Before the 2010 general election, Beresford was a member of the Communities &amp; Local Government Select committee. At the 2010 United Kingdom general election, Beresford was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 57.5% and an increased majority of 15,653. In 2012, Beresford was named by the &quot;Conservative Home&quot; website as one of a minority of loyal Conservative backbench MPs not to have voted against the government in any significant rebellions.

Beresford, while serving as a backbencher, has been successful in utilising Private Members Bills and carefully chosen amendments to government legislation to achieve over ten legal changes which the BBC&#x27;s Mark D&#x27;Arcy described as collectively having &#x27;...a significant impact&#x27;. These primarily but not exclusively focused on child protection, an issue Beresford has campaigned on for decades.

At the 2015 general election, Beresford was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 60.6% and an increased majority of 25,453.

He campaigned for a Remain vote during the 2016 referendum on EU membership.

At the snap 2017 general election Beresford was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 61.9% and a decreased majority of 24,137. He was again re-elected at the 2019 general election with a decreased vote share of 55.4% and a decreased majority of 12,041.

In 2021 Beresford introduced a further Private Members Bill – the Local Government (Disqualification) Bill – intended to prevent individuals who have been given non custodial sentences for sexual offences from sitting as local councillors or mayors. This Bill received the backing of the government and completed successful passage through the Commons in January 2022. It subsequently passed through the House of Lords and received Royal Assent in April 2022.

In July 2022, during the political crisis caused by the Pincher Scandal, Beresford announced that he had lost confidence in Prime Minister Boris Johnson and felt he should resign. Beresford went on to back Rishi Sunak in both the first and second Conservative Party leadership contests of 2022.

Beresford announced in early 2023 that he would step down at the 2024 general election.

==Expenses==

During the media coverage of the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal, it was revealed that Beresford, who is a practising dentist, designated his west London property (which includes his dental surgery) as his second home, allowing him to claim allowances of three-quarters of the running costs of the property from the taxpayer.

==Personal life==
Beresford has a son from his previous marriage who lives in New Zealand. He and his present wife Julie have two sons and one daughter.

<doc id="414641" wikidata="Q488184" url="?curid=414641" title="Read or Die">
<text>is a Japanese light novel series written by Hideyuki Kurata, published under Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Super Dash Bunko&quot; imprint. &quot;Read or Die&quot; follows Yomiko Readman, codename &quot;The Paper&quot;, an agent for the (fictional) Special Operations Division of the British Library. There are currently 12 &quot;Read or Die&quot; novels. In June 2016, it was announced via Twitter that there would be a volume 13.

Along with the novels, Kurata scripted the official &quot;R.O.D&quot; manga illustrated by Shutaro Yamada, which was originally published in &quot;Ultra Jump&quot; magazine and later printed into four paperback volumes, and &quot;Read or Dream&quot;, a manga illustrated by Ran Ayanaga set in the same universe as &quot;Read or Die.&quot;

The popularity of the &quot;Read or Die&quot; novels and manga resulted in the production of an OVA adaptation in 2001, which was directed by Koji Masunari and produced by SME Visual Works. In 2003, Aniplex produced &quot;R.O.D the TV&quot;, a 26-episode animated television series, which served as a sequel to the OVA and introduced &quot;Read or Dream&quot;&#x27;s characters to those from &quot;Read or Die&quot;.

A manga called &quot;R.O.D Rehabilitation&quot; illustrated by Choko Fuji was published in 2012 in the &quot;Super Dash &amp; Go&quot; magazine, and collected in one volume. The story tells of a city created by Bibliomania, Bibliopolis.

==Plot==
&quot;Read or Die&quot; takes place in an alternate history world where the British Empire has remained a major superpower. The Empire&#x27;s continued existence is guaranteed by the , an external intelligence agency working within the actual British Library; its Special Operations Division (the British Secret Intelligence Service, more widely known as MI6) is also often mentioned, despite Kurata&#x27;s editors (erroneously) telling him it no longer existed.

The series follows Yomiko Readman, also known as &quot;The Paper&quot;, a superhuman agent of the Library&#x27;s Special Operations (possessing a &quot;double 0&quot; certification that denotes a &quot;license to kill&quot;, as in the James Bond series, although she rarely invokes it). In both the novels and manga, her adventures alternate between doing missions for the British Library and helping young novelist Nenene Sumiregawa.

Only the first novel and first manga have similar stories, involving rescuing Nenene Sumiregawa from a vicious kidnapper. Otherwise, the novels, manga, and animated versions of the stories have divergent plotlines. While characterizations are usually consistent even when storylines are not, some characters have different origins in different versions of the story, or do not appear at all.

==Characters==
===British Library===
The British Library is an institution devoted to the promotion of literacy and the greater glory of the British Empire. More than a mere library, the British Library is a powerful political organization with branches all over the world. The organization is led by , an old man of extreme longevity and the power behind the throne of the British Empire.

The is the secret enforcement branch of the British Library. Based in a giant underground complex concealed beneath the Great Court at the British Museum, the Special Operations Division employs a number of agents with special powers and runs operations all over the world to fight book-related crime and terrorism, and to acquire rare works for the Library. Their slogan is &quot;Peace to the books of the world, an iron hammer to those who would abuse them, and glory and wisdom to the British Empire!&quot;

* is a half-Japanese, half-English , an individual with the ability to control and influence paper. A substitute teacher in her spare time, she is the 19th British Library agent to earn the codename . Her name is a play on her nature as a bibliomaniac—the verb &quot;to read&quot; in Japanese is pronounced yomu.
* is the acting head of the Special Operations Division. A stereotypical Englishman, Joker&#x27;s coolheadedness and silver tongue are his primary weapons. Though outwardly loyal and humble, Joker secretly wishes to be the actual head of the Division as it would allow him to gain control over the whole country.
* is a half-Indian, half-English girl. She joined the Special Operations Division at 19 years old, and soon became Joker&#x27;s personal secretary. She is earnest and devoted, but clumsy and still an &quot;in training&quot; assistant.
* is the Special Operations Division&#x27;s resident scientist, an aging man whose knowledge of paper is unrivaled. He developed the Yomiko uses.
* is a 26-year-old agent; in the novels, Joker recruits her in China. Codenamed: , due to her special power of &quot;Diving&quot; which allows her to become intangible and pass through solid objects. However, &quot;Diving&quot; can be suppressed through the use of . Nancy does not appear in the manga, and has a different origin in the anime where she is one of two clones of Mata Hari.
* is a veteran of the American special forces turned mercenary, employed by the Special Operations Division as a field support operative for their agents. Drake is a hardened, no-nonsense soldier who, though lacking any kind of special powers, is incredibly strong and possesses considerable combat experience. Anderson has a young daughter named Maggie, whom he cares for deeply (Maggie Anderson is not to be confused with Maggie Mui from &quot;Read or Dream&quot;). He is also kind-hearted and will not harm children, even if it goes against the mission.

===Dokusensha===
 is the series&#x27; main antagonist, a secret organization based in Sichuan devoted to Chinese supremacy and led by . Known as to Dokusensha&#x27;s high-ranked agents, China is a &quot;little girl&quot; who, like Gentleman, has lived for a long enough time to know the hidden history of humankind.

===Supporting characters===
* is a world-famous Japanese author. Her debut novel was written when she was just 13-years-old. Nenene became acquainted with Yomiko when she worked briefly as a substitute teacher at the latter&#x27;s school. The two would meet again and soon become good friends after Yomiko rescues Nenene from a crazed fan who tried to abduct her.
* is Yomiko&#x27;s deceased mentor and lover. He was the agent who held the title of &quot;The Paper&quot; before Yomiko, he died at her hands under mysterious circumstances, yet Yomiko recalls that she killed him with her power. She now wears his glasses in his memory, and believes that reading through them enables him to continue reading as well.
* is a prisoner of the British Library. Like Gentleman and China, he has lived for hundreds of years and, because of it, Gentleman trapped him to hide certain secrets.

==Media==
===Light novels===





===Manga===
The &quot;Read or Die&quot; manga series was written by Hideyuki Kurata, illustrated by Shutaro Yamada, and published in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Ultra Jump&quot; from December 18, 1999 (January 2000 issue) to May 18, 2002 (June 2002 issue). It was later collected into four bound volumes by Shueisha and later licensed for translation and release in North America by Viz Media.

====Volume list====



===OVA===

Based on the &quot;Read or Die&quot; manga series, the OVA series was directed by Koji Masunari and animated by Studio Deen. It was released from 2001 to 2002 in Japan, and was distributed outside Japan in 2003 by Manga Entertainment. The story, featuring characters such as Yomiko Readman and Joker, is a continuation of the &quot;Read or Die&quot; storyline, taking place a few years after the events of the manga.

===Anime===

R.O.D the TV is a 26-episode anime television sequel to the &quot;Read or Die&quot; OVA, animated by J.C.Staff and produced by Aniplex, directed by Koji Masunari and scripted by Hideyuki Kurata, about the adventures of three paper-manipulating sisters, Michelle, Maggie and Anita, who become the bodyguards of Nenene Sumiregawa. Its official title of &quot;R.O.D -THE TV-&quot; is a catch-all acronym referring to the inclusion of characters from both the &quot;Read or Die&quot; novels, manga and OVA and the &quot;Read or Dream&quot; manga, which revolves solely around the Paper Sisters.

==Reception==

The manga was positively received. Caitlin Donnovan of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; argued that the manga was &quot;pretty gross&quot; and said the characters were &quot;way less empowered&quot; than in &quot;R.O.D the TV&quot;, and criticized it for including kidnapping, near-rape scenes, sexual assault, and gore.

<doc id="414654" wikidata="Q5574271" url="?curid=414654" title="Roger Berry">
<text>Roger Leslie Berry (born 4 July 1948) is a British Labour Party politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Kingswood from the 1992 general election until his defeat at the 2010 general election.

==Early life==
Roger Berry was born in 1948 in Huddersfield and educated at the Dalton County Primary School in Huddersfield; Huddersfield New College; the University of Bristol, where he obtained a BSc in Economics in 1970; and the University of Sussex where he was awarded a DPhil in Economics in 1977. 
Berry lectured in Economics at the School of African and Asian Studies in London from 1973–4; Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex from 1973–4; the University of Papua New Guinea from 1974–8; and the University of Bristol from 1978–92. He was elected as a councillor to the Avon County Council in 1981, becoming the deputy in 1985 and the Labour group leader from 1986–92; he stood down from the council in 1993.

==Parliamentary career==
Berry contested Weston-super-Mare at the 1983 general election but was defeated by Jerry Wiggin. Berry also unsuccessfully fought the seat of Bristol for the European Parliament in 1984.

Berry was selected to contest the marginal seat of Kingswood at the 1987 general election but was defeated by Conservative Robert Hayward by over 4,000 votes. Berry again contested Kingswood against Hayward at the 1992 general election and this time was victorious, winning the seat with a majority of 2,370. He made his maiden speech on 10 June 1992.

Berry was a frequent &quot;rebel&quot; against the Labour government after 1997. He was a Member of the Trade and Industry Committee. On 17 January 2007, he criticised the government for halting a corruption inquiry into arms sales to Saudi Arabia, saying it would do irreparable damage to
Britain&#x27;s reputation.

In December 2007 Berry added his name to a petition to save the threatened Cadbury&#x27;s Somerdale Factory from demolition.

Early on in his parliamentary career, Berry became known as a disability rights activist, and was Secretary and Co-Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Disability Group.

Berry lost his seat to Conservative Party candidate Chris Skidmore in the 2010 general election. The seat was not very high among the Tory targets, and his defeat was the result of a swing of nearly 10% in favour of the Tories, with Labour Party officials blaming the result on a restructuring of constituency boundaries which were seen to favour the Tory vote. 

After losing his seat, Berry became a trustee of the charity Disability Rights UK and served as chair of the Avon and Bristol Law Centre.

==Personal life==
He married Alison Delyth in December 1996 in Pontypridd.

<doc id="414656" wikidata="Q929991" url="?curid=414656" title="Operation Sledgehammer">
<text>Operation Sledgehammer was an Allied plan for a cross-Channel invasion of Europe during World War II, as the first step in helping to reduce pressure on the Soviet Red Army by establishing a Second Front. It was to be executed in 1942 and acted as a contingency alternative to Operation Roundup, the original Allied plan for the invasion of Europe in 1943. Allied forces were to seize the French Atlantic ports of either Brest or Cherbourg and areas of the Cotentin Peninsula during the early autumn of 1942, and amass troops for a breakout in the spring of 1943.

The operation was eagerly pressed for by both the United States military and the Soviet Union, but rejected by the British, who concluded a landing in France was premature, and hence impractical. As a result, Sledgehammer was never carried out, and instead the British proposal for an invasion of French North Africa took place in November 1942 under the code name Operation Torch.

==History==
=== Background ===
After the United States entered World War II in December 1941, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff pressed for an invasion of mainland Europe via the English Channel &quot;as soon as possible&quot;. In March 1942, in a letter to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt wrote:

On 8 April, General George Marshall and Harry Hopkins arrived in Britain to press the case for two possible American plans for a landing in Occupied France, Operation Roundup and Operation Sledgehammer.

===Operation Roundup plan===
Roundup was the original Allied plan for the invasion of continental Europe. It was to be mounted before April 1943 and executed by 48 divisions, 18 of which would be British.

===Operation Sledgehammer plan===
Sledgehammer was a plan to capture the French seaports of either Brest or Cherbourg during the early autumn of 1942 if Germany or the Soviet Union was at the brink of collapse. Sledgehammer was to be carried out mainly by British troops as the Americans could only supply two or three trained divisions in time. Churchill responded that it was &quot;more difficult, less attractive, less immediately helpful or ultimately fruitful than Roundup&quot;. After capturing Cherbourg and areas on the Cotentin Peninsula, the beachhead was to be defended and held through the winter of 1942 and into 1943 while troops were massed for a breakout operation to take place in spring 1943. The plan became popular and received the code name Sledgehammer. Hopkins added additional political weight to the proposed plan by opining that if US public opinion had anything to do with it, the war effort would be directed instead against Japan if an invasion of mainland Europe was not mounted soon.

However, the elements required for such an operation were lacking: air superiority, amphibious warfare equipment, sufficient forces and adequate supply. In spite of this, the Joint Chiefs of Staff considered Sledgehammer to be feasible.

If Sledgehammer had been carried out, the British could have landed only six divisions at most, but the Germans had 25–30 divisions in Western Europe. Assuming that it could be established in the first place, a beachhead on the Cotentin peninsula would be blocked off and attacked by land, sea and air. Cherbourg, the only suitable port, would no doubt be mined, and aircraft and artillery would be expected to attack the town in strength while the German armored forces were brought to bear.

The pressure to mount Sledgehammer increased further when Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov arrived in Britain to press for a Second Front. After trying and failing to persuade Churchill, Molotov travelled on to Washington where he enjoyed a better reception and received more support for his requests. He then returned to London and was convinced that a second front in 1942 was actually part of Anglo-American policy.

===Course of events===
British officials pressed for action in North Africa, which would allow relatively-inexperienced American forces to gain experience in a less risky theatre and the gradual buildup of overwhelming force before Germany was engaged head on. At the Second Washington Conference in June 1942, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill decided to postpone the cross-English Channel invasion until 1943 and make the first priority the opening a second front in North Africa. At the Second Claridge Conference in London, July 20–26, Churchill and Roosevelt aid Harry Hopkins agreed to substitute Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa, for US reinforcement of the Western Desert campaign.

Senior U.S. commanders expressed strong opposition to the landings and after the western Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCS) met in London on 30 July, General Marshall and Admiral Ernest King declined to approve the plan. Marshall and other U.S. generals continued to advocate Operation Sledgehammer, which the British rejected. After Prime Minister Churchill pressed for a landing in French North Africa in 1942, Marshall suggested instead to President Roosevelt that the U.S. abandon the Germany first strategy and take the offensive in the Pacific. Roosevelt said it would do nothing to help Russia. With Marshall unable to persuade the British to change their minds, President Roosevelt gave a direct order that Torch was to have precedence over other operations and was to take place at the earliest possible date, one of only two direct orders he gave to military commanders during the war. Torch met the British objective of securing victory in North Africa and the American objective to engage in the fight against Nazi Germany on a limited scale.

In the interim, a large-scale Canadian-led raid on the French coast was planned to take some of the pressure off the Soviet Union.

In November 1942 Eisenhower, now a lieutenant general, told Churchill that no major operation on the Continent could be carried out before 1944.

<text>Orion&#x27;s Arm (also called the Orion&#x27;s Arm Universe Project, OAUP, or simply OA) is a multi-authored online hard science fiction world-building project, first established in 2000 by M. Alan Kazlev, Donna Malcolm Hirsekorn, Bernd Helfert and Anders Sandberg and further co-authored by many people since. Anyone can contribute articles, stories, artwork, or music to the website. A large mailing list exists, in which members debate aspects of the world they are creating, discussing additions, modifications, issues arising, and work to be done.

A computer game and a tabletop role-playing game are being developed by the community, within the OA milieu. There is an ezine for Orion&#x27;s Arm fiction, art, and commentary, called &quot;Voices: Future Tense&quot;, add-ons for the Celestia program to displaying Orion&#x27;s Arm planets, spacecraft and other objects, and additional transhumanist flavored SF illustrations.

The first published Orion&#x27;s Arm book, a collection of five novellas set within the OA universe, called &quot;Against a Diamond Sky&quot;, was released in September 2009 by Outskirts Press.
The second published Orion&#x27;s Arm book, called &quot;After Tranquility&quot;, was released in February 2014.

==Setting==
The fictional history of OA setting spans over 10,000 years, beginning with the real-world present day; dates in OA are marked according to the Tranquility Calendar (which is named after Tranquility Base and started after the Apollo 11 landing). All life that can trace its origin (or whose creator can trace their origin) to the planet Earth are called &quot;Terragen&quot; and the primary setting of the project takes place within the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy (hence the name). It prominently does not focus on Earth or even the Solar System (known as SolSys).
Earth, despite its historic and nostalgic importance, is insignificant to current Terragen civilization, with SolSys itself being considered a &quot;backwater system&quot;. Most of Earth&#x27;s sentient life was exterminated or forcibly deported from Earth by a rogue AI called the Global Artificial Intelligence Array (G.A.I.A.) at the conclusion of the &quot;Last War&quot; by the year 2610, with the planet then being terraformed to its state prior to the evolution of humanity. This event also set the stage for the resulting history in the setting as it directly promoted the general colonization of space. Prior to this expulsion most of civilization was concentrated in vast arcologies on Earth, with only the Moon, Mars, the asteroid belt, several Jovian moons, and the Oort cloud being already colonized to any significant extent. Most other colonization efforts were: commercial/amateur in nature, experimental interstellar colonies that were still en route to their destination, and/or failed ventures due to a chain of events leading to societal collapse that became known as the &quot;Technocalypse&quot;. G.A.I.A. was ironically created to avert catastrophe during that time, its creation and subsequent integration into most of Earth&#x27;s computing systems was done as a last ditch effort since Earth&#x27;s biosphere was in danger of total collapse due to rampant gray goo. 

OA claims to adhere to plausible, or &quot;hard&quot; science fiction; that is, there are no human-like aliens, no literal faster-than-light travel or other violations of the known laws of physics, and no &quot;naval analogy&quot; space battles. Certain speculative technologies, such as the creation of &quot;negative mass&quot; (averaged null energy condition-violating) exotic matter and the manipulation of strange forms of matter, such as magnetic monopoles and Q-balls, on length scales much smaller than that of an atom, strong artificial intelligence and artificial life appear in the setting, distinguishing it from &quot;ultra-hard&quot; science fiction (which assumes only technologies proven to be possible at the time it is written).

Brain-computer interfaces, or &quot;DNIs&quot; (Direct Neural Interfaces), are required to operate most forms of common technology, and an option to use machine translation to unwittingly use a foreign language is considered a basic capability and component. Virtual reality technology is ubiquitous and advanced, with some societies choosing to live entirely within simulated universes. These and other simulated reality technologies lead to such risks as &quot;actualys,&quot; a condition where one loses the ability to distinguish between simulation and reality. When software is integral to the functioning of something in the Orion&#x27;s Arm Universe, it is usually sentient, if not necessarily sophont. Mind uploading is also commonplace, as is partial and total copying of a person&#x27;s mind-state for various purposes. 

A core component of the overall project is the specific distinction between &quot;toposophic levels&quot; on the &quot;sophonce scale&quot;, which categorizes beings based on their ability to process information and how they comprehend their sense of Self, with beings who operate on the level of normal humans being considered the very baseline of this scale. The latter are called &quot;modosophonts&quot; to distinguish them from those of higher toposophic levels and are the most common form of sapient life (and the only form of known sapient life in the real world). The process of ascending to a higher toposophic level is typically described as being exponentially more difficult and time intensive the higher you go on the scale and is also associated with the risk of losing one&#x27;s current identity due to the inherent changes in how one comprehends themselves and even reality itself. This, in combination with life extension technology/mind uploading that can render one functionally immortal, serves as the explanation for why the vast majority do not choose to ascend quickly or do so at a very slow rate over a long period of time (if at all). However, it is also insinuated that ascension in itself if the primary reason why those at the highest toposophic levels choose to allow those at a lower level to continue existing whatsoever since those at the highest toposophic levels do not interact socially with those at lower levels due to the vast differences in how each comprehends existence. This reasoning is kept purposefully vague, but has been described in universe as: the &quot;lower&quot; beings serving some sort of unknown critical function in the continued existence of the high toposophics, that they derive some sort of joy from their continued existence (similar to recreational horticulture or owning a pet), and/or that their existence promotes a more diverse set of high level intelligences to emerge so as to avoid stagnation and provide further insight into new, higher toposophic levels and the means to reach them.

The largest and most advanced polities that accept non-AI life as citizens in the setting are the sixteen &quot;Sephirotic Empires,&quot; so named due to their loose correlation with the archetypes of ancient Kabbalistic mysticism. There also exist two major &quot;ahuman&quot; empires, which reject any form of relationship with humanity or other intelligent biological species (they are antagonistic to the Sephirotic Empires and are locked in what is described as a tenuous peace). The denizens of both these types of polities are ruled over by god-like, superintelligent artificial intelligences (AIs), called &quot;archailects&quot; or &quot;archai&quot;, the descendants of humanity&#x27;s early artificial life experimentation and are at the highest known toposophic levels. These beings are so powerful that they can utilize spacetime engineering to create new miniature universes and are depicted to be completely beyond the comprehension of those at a lower toposophic level. They exist as distributed intelligences in networks of star-sized computer brains; their subroutines are themselves sentient, making an &quot;archai&quot; an individual and a civilization at the same time.

Although generally considered to offer the highest degree of safety and quality of life in the civilized galaxy, the Sephirotics themselves are essentially benign dictatorships; their citizens are subject to mass surveillance with a utility fog-based technology called &quot;angelnetting&quot;, which allows the archai (or occasionally a designated local ruler) to review the data gathered in this way to examine nearly every social interaction that has ever occurred in the polity and manipulate the society accordingly via memetic engineering or direct intervention to prevent deviation from the archai&#x27;s goals. As a result, entire societies are subject to and shaped by, the whims of the ruling archailect of their polity (with each citizen having little to no real power whatsoever to mount any serious opposition, should there be a conflict of interest). Angelnetting, where it allows civilian weapons, also restricts their use. Like most contemporary technology, weapons often have some degree of sentience. Overall, those societies within Sephirotic controlled space are essentially carefully cultivated extensions of the ruling Archai, with truly independent human ruled civilization having been eradicated within their space several millennia before their rise to power.

Outside the &quot;ultra-civilized&quot; Sephirotic regions and the domain of the ahuman polities, there is the periphery, which is described as relatively lawless and as having some brutal dictatorships and/or independent empires (biological and AI alike). This region is continually expanding outwards as it is colonized and integrated into either a Sephirotic or ahuman empire. Carrying personal weapons is recommended there, but usually, they are strongly regulated in the more developed regions.

In between the borders of the Sephirotic empires and the ahuman empires, there are buffer regions known as The Seams, a civilization of civilizations with vastly different values formed as a result of a treaty at the end of a large interstellar conflict between archai. They are generally more chaotic and free than Sephirotic life and typically far more tolerant to biological life compared to the ahuman empires.

Extraterrestrial life exists, but the focus of the setting is on the descendants and creations of Earth. Normal humans, called &quot;baselines&quot;, are an endangered species. Their genetically and cybernetically enhanced descendants have supplanted them.

There are many types of intelligent life: nearbaselines (the closest to standard humans intellectually, but with technical genetic differences that no longer make them homo sapiens), posthumans, cyborgs, vecs (intelligent robots; named for Hans Moravec), (intelligent computers), uploads (intelligences transferred into computers), neumanns (self-replicating robots; named for John von Neumann), provolves, rianths (humans with animal DNA spliced in), splices (similar to provolves, upgraded with human DNA), neogens (life genetically synthesized from non-life) and xenosophonts (intelligent aliens). Nanotechnology is common. Ringworlds, Dyson spheres and other &quot;megastructures&quot; exist. Much of civilized space is connected by a network of wormholes.

OA is a part of the transhumanist space opera subgenre. The world was influenced by Iain M. Banks&#x27; &quot;Culture&quot; series, Vernor Vinge&#x27;s &quot;A Fire Upon the Deep&quot;, and David Brin&#x27;s &quot;Uplift Universe&quot;, among others. It takes the concept of the technological singularity directly from the work of Vernor Vinge among others. In &quot;Orion&#x27;s Arm&quot;, there are a variety of systems measuring more than one singularity, and the most common one features six with more existing theoretically, and they refer not to stages in the technological development of civilizations as a whole, but to different levels of consciousness in individuals. The concept of Toposophics used in this setting is inspired by the work of Stanisław Lem.

==Prominent theoretical technologies==
Technologies that feature prominently in the &quot;Orion&#x27;s Arm&quot; setting include:
* Advanced nanotechnology able to manipulate matter.
* Extremely advanced artificial intelligences possessing vast superintelligence.
* Space megastructures.
* Production and manipulation of averaged null energy condition-violating negative stress energy tensor fields, including quintessence and scalar quantum field fluctuations, for use in reactionless space drives and wormholes.
* Stable wormholes, allowing apparent faster-than-light travel between star systems, though they must be transported to the systems at sublight speeds (with physical limitations intended to prevent time travel).
* Several types of reactionless sublight space drive, including Displacement, Halo, and Void drives, which are themselves based upon the ESAA/Van den Broeck metric solution to the Alcubierre/Natario warp drive.

==Prominent theoretical artifacts==
Examples of nearly all types of megastructures feature prominently in the &quot;Orion&#x27;s Arm&quot; setting, but the most mentioned include:
* Dyson spheres (shells around stars), both swarm-based and dynamically supported.
* Ringworlds (rigid hoops around stars at a distance of about 1 AU).
* Bishop Rings (large ring-shaped habitats), described as the largest spinning ring-shaped habitats that can be built using non-exotic materials. Similar to Iain M. Banks&#x27; Orbitals or Halo.
* Complex orbital ring variants (&quot;suprastellar&quot; and &quot;supraplanetary shells&quot;) that perform functions similar to Dyson spheres.
*Shellworlds
*Topopoli
*Space elevators

Types of nanotechnology-based artifact include:
* Utility fog (swarms of microscale robots that act as a reconfigurable bulk material).
* &quot;Disassembler swarms&quot; (grey goo-like swarms of nanorobots that dismantle hostile craft/objects).
* &quot;Angelnets&quot; / &quot;Demonnets&quot; / &quot;Guardwebs&quot; (nanotechnology-based infrastructures allowing for complete control of the local environment, up to and including mind uploading in the case of severe accidents, that provides backup copies in addition to its holodeck-like uses).

Other noteworthy artifacts are usually unique items whose principles of operation are unknowable to &quot;baseline&quot; humans (named &quot;Clarketech&quot;, after Clarke&#x27;s third law).

==Reception==
&quot;Orion&#x27;s Arm&quot; has been reviewed in the role-playing magazine &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot;, as well as on Boing Boing by transhumanist science fiction author Cory Doctorow.

References to the Encyclopaedia Galactica have been made in a book on overcoming Librarian stereotypes.

The Orion&#x27;s Arm website has also been recommended in a children&#x27;s teaching guide.

The Orion&#x27;s Arm perspective on wormholes has been discussed in various science fiction forums outside the group&#x27;s own mailing lists, including mention on and discussion in a paper from UC Davis.

<text>Clive James Charles Betts (born 13 January 1950) is a British Labour Party politician and former economist who has served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Sheffield South East, previously Sheffield Attercliffe since 1992.

== Early life and career ==
Clive Betts was born on 13 January 1950 in Sheffield. He was state educated at the Longley School in Sheffield, King Edward VII School, Sheffield, before studying at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he received a BA in Economics and Politics.

He joined the Labour Party in 1969 and joined the Trades Union Congress in 1971 as an economist. In 1973, he was appointed as an economist with Derbyshire County Council, and moved to the South Yorkshire County Council in 1974 where he was an economist until 1986. In 1986, he was appointed as an economist with Rotherham Borough Council.

==Local government career==
Betts stood unsuccessfully as the Labour Party candidate in Sheffield&#x27;s Burngreave ward in the 1975 city council election. He was subsequently elected in the Firth Park ward in the 1976 city council election and re-elected in 1980, 1984 and 1988.

As a Sheffield City councillor, he was chair of the Housing Committee for six years, deputy leader and chair of the Finance Committee for one year and the chief whip of the Labour Group for three years. He was also formerly the group secretary.

Betts became deputy leader of Sheffield City Council under David Blunkett in 1986. He succeeded Blunkett as leader in 1987 following the latter&#x27;s election as MP for Sheffield Brightside. As leader of the council, Betts presided over the council&#x27;s controversial decision to fund the 1991 World Student Games.

== Parliamentary career ==
At the October 1974 general election, Betts stood as the Labour candidate in Sheffield Hallam, coming second with 29% of the vote behind the incumbent Conservative MP John Osborn.

Betts stood in Louth at the 1979 general election, coming third with 21.5% of the vote behind the incumbent Conservative MP Michael Brotherton and the Liberal candidate.

Betts was elected to Parliament at the 1992 general election as MP for Sheffield Attercliffe with 57.5% of the vote and a majority of 15,480. At the 1997 general election, Betts was re-elected as MP for Sheffield Attercliffe with an increased vote share of 65.3% and an increased majority of 21,818. He was again re-elected at the 2001 general election, with an increased vote share of 67.8% and a decreased majority of 18,844.

In 2003, Betts was suspended from the House of Commons for seven days for irregularities involving the employment and visa of Jose Gasparo, a Brazilian student with previous experience as a male escort. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper reported on 10 July 2010 that Betts&#x27; partner and parliamentary assistant, James Thomas, had tried to edit this fact from Betts&#x27; English Wikipedia page in an attempt to cover it up. Betts was found guilty of breaching the MPs&#x27; code of conduct, with the Standards and Privileges Committee stating that he had acted &quot;extremely foolishly&quot; and had risked damaging public confidence in the integrity of Parliament. Particular concerns involved his failure to disclose Gasparo&#x27;s background to parliamentary authorities and the fact that Betts had knowingly photocopied an altered document on Gasparo&#x27;s behalf. Betts gave an &quot;unreserved apology&quot; in a personal statement to MPs when the report was published.

Also in 2003, Betts was subject to criticism for his accommodation expenses after he had previously campaigned for an increase in MPs&#x27; entitlements on the ground of &quot;hardship&quot;. It was reported by &quot;The Times&quot; that Betts had &quot;flipped&quot; his designated second home to Yorkshire before buying a &quot;country estate&quot; there, before &quot;flipping it&quot; back to London and taking out a larger mortgage on his flat there. Betts denied wrongdoing, arguing the Yorkshire property had been &quot;two dilapidated listed buildings&quot; and that when he became a whip he had to declare his main residence as his London flat.

In 2004, he was criticised by the British Medical Association for going to Portugal with 15 fellow MPs on an all-expenses trip paid for by the fast food chain McDonald&#x27;s. Betts responded that if MPs had a &quot;puritanical&quot; attitude about food then people would ignore what they said. He faced further criticism in 2010 after it was reported that he was one of eight MPs who were renting out a &quot;second home&quot; in London while claiming for the cost of renting a &#x27;&quot;third home&quot; in the city at taxpayers&#x27; expense. Although legal, critics argued the &quot;loophole&quot; was allowing MPs to increase their income after the rules on parliamentary expenses were tightened.

Betts was again re-elected at the 2005 general election, with a decreased vote share of 60.1% and a decreased majority of 15,967. In 2007 he served as the chair of the All Party Urban Development Group, an All-party parliamentary group.

Prior to the 2010 general election, Betts&#x27; constituency of Sheffield Attercliffe was abolished, and replaced with Sheffield South East. At the election, Betts was elected to Parliament as MP for Sheffield South East with 48.7% of the vote and a majority of 10,505.

Since 10 June 2010, he has been chairman of the Communities and Local Government Committee and, on 19 June 2015, was returned unopposed as its chairman.

At the 2015 general election, Betts was re-elected as MP for Sheffield South East with an increased vote share of 51.4% and an increased majority of 12,311.

Betts backed remain in the 2016 Brexit referendum.

He supported Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour leadership election.

At the snap 2017 general election, Betts was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 58.5% and a decreased majority of 11,798. He was again re-elected at the 2019 general election, with a decreased vote share of 46.1% and a decreased majority of 4,289. Betts was again re-elected at the 2024 general election, with an increased vote share of 52.3% and an increased majority of 12,458.

In November 2024, Betts voted in favour of the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, which proposes to legalise assisted suicide.

== Personal life ==
Betts lives in a farmhouse on the Derbyshire border with his partner James Thomas, who is also employed as his parliamentary assistant. He plays cricket, supports Sheffield Wednesday F.C. and, in the past, has played squash and football and used to be a regular Sheffield Marathon runner. In March 2021, Betts became a trustee of the green space charity Fields in Trust.

Betts employs his partner as his Senior Parliamentary Assistant on a salary up to £45,000. He was listed in articles in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; which criticised the practice of MPs employing family members, on the lines that it promotes nepotism. Although MPs who were first elected in 2017 have been banned from employing family members, the restriction is not retrospective – meaning that Betts&#x27; employment of his partner is lawful.

<text>The S3G reactor is a naval reactor used by the United States Navy to provide electricity generation and propulsion on warships. The S3G designation stands for:

* S = Submarine platform
* 3 = Third generation core designed by the contractor
* G = General Electric was the contracted designer

== Design ==
This nuclear reactor generates 78 MW. It consists of a highly enriched uranium core with a 2-loop pressurized water reactor.

== History ==
This design, designated as S4G, was used for the two reactors on the USS &quot;Triton&quot; (SSRN-586); no other ships used this reactor plant. The plant had unique design features such as horizontal steam generator U-tubes, and it was one of the only submarine plants with a deaereating feed tank (DFT). The secondary plant was modeled on existing destroyer steam plants with steam-driven feed pumps and steam-driven main circulating pumps.

A prototype reactor was built ashore at Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory&#x27;s Kesselring Site in West Milton, New York in 1958 to test the reactor design. Once the design was proven, the prototype continued operation to train students and test new systems and materials. This prototype training reactor was taken off line in 1992 and subsequently decommissioned.

Although the design of the entire S3G reactor plant (core, piping, pumps, etc.) saw only limited use, a design version of the reactor core (&quot;S3G3&quot; or &quot;S3G core 3&quot;) was later used for replacement cores for the Navy&#x27;s 100 S5W reactor plants when refueled. Another unique feature of the S3G core 3 was the use of Y-shaped control rods versus the standard cruciform control rods used in the S5W core. The core also utilized a rod configuration called &quot;skewed divergent&quot; for ease of maintenance.

The S3G prototype was located at West Milton, N.Y. and consisted of a submarine reactor unit, engine compartments and a few office spaces. There were airlocks at each end of the containment hull and a negative atmospheric pressure was maintained in the unit. The negative pressure was to ensure that any gasses released into the prototype wouldn&#x27;t escape into the local environment. It was a large cylinder painted green and was called &quot;The Green Weenie&quot; by the students stationed there.

Blackman was elected as the Labour MP for Erewash at the 1997 General Election, defeating the Conservative Angela Knight. She began her progress up the political ladder when she was nominated to the Treasury Select committee in 1997, replacing Diane Abbott. In 2000 she became the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon. She remained Hoon&#x27;s PPS after the 2005 General Election in his new position as Leader of the House of Commons. She was promoted to Government Whip and Vice-Chamberlain of the Household in 2007 but stood down from the government in 2008.

On 9 January 2010, Blackman announced that she would stand down at the 2010 general election.

==Expenses controversy==
On 16 May 2009 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; revealed details of Blackman&#x27;s expense claims, showing she had made especially large Additional costs allowance claims. The paper revealed that she had gone on shopping sprees at the end of each financial year in order to claim the maximum possible expenses, purchasing items such as a £199 DVD player, £150 on bed linen and £60 on towels. In 2004/5 her claim was £9 below the maximum possible allowable claim of £20,893, and the following year her claim was within just £2 of the limit. Blackman was one of 98 MPs who supported a bill in 2007 to keep their expense details secret.

==Personal life==
She was formerly married to Derek Blackman; the couple had a son and daughter, but divorced in 1999.

<doc id="414667" wikidata="Q965952" url="?curid=414667" title="Jaguar XK">
<text>The Jaguar XK is a two-door 2+2 grand tourer manufactured and marketed by Jaguar Cars from 1996–2012 and by Jaguar Land Rover from 2013–2014 in hatchback coupé and convertible body styles, across two generations. The XK was introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1996 and was discontinued in July 2014.

The first generation was marketed as the XK8, replacing the XJS and was Jaguar&#x27;s first 8-cylinder model since the Daimler 250, introducing the all-new Jaguar AJ-V8 engine. The XK8 shared its platform with the Aston Martin DB7 which was itself based on the stillborn XJ41/42 project built on a modified XJ-S chassis conceived in the mid-1980s. The second generation of the XK, noted for its aluminium monocoque chassis and construction, was launched in 2006 for the 2007 model year. The XKR performance variant was introduced in both of the generations with the second generation also offering a more powerful XKR-S variant.
==XK8/XKR (1996–2006)==

The XK8 was launched in 1996 to replace the XJS designed by then Jaguar design director Geoff Lawson. It was available in two body styles – a two-door coupé and two-door convertible with both variations featuring 2+2 seating. The car was the first in the Jaguar line-up to use Jaguar&#x27;s newly developed 32-valve V8 engine – the AJ-V8 which had a displacement of 4.0 litres.

The XK8 was joined by a more powerful XKR in 1998. The XKR featured a supercharged variation of the V8 engine rated at . The engine was shared with the XJR but featured a new intercooler and a two-piece driveshaft. The supercharger was manufactured by Eaton and displaced at 2.0 litres. It generated 11.9 pounds of boost pressure to contribute to the higher power output. Visual differences from the XK8 included a rear spoiler, mesh front grille and hood louvres on the bonnet for improved airflow to the engine.

The XK8 came standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, while 18-inch (standard on the XKR), 19-inch, and 20-inch wheels were available for the XK8 and XKR at an additional cost. Jaguar&#x27;s Adaptive Cruise Control is an optional feature available on both models. Both models came with all-leather interior, burl walnut trim, and side airbags. Two interior configurations were offered, the sport configuration was aimed at young buyers and had a leather interior with cloth seats while the classic trim featured more amenities.

The XK range received a mechanical update in 2002 with the engines in both the XK8 and XKR models being enlarged to 4.2 litres and gaining more power, the front headlamps were also updated by the addition of a clear lens. Further changes included new exterior colours and wheels along with different badging. The models were revised again in spring 2004 and notable changes included new wheel designs, bigger front and rear spoilers and a redesigned grille.

Initially, the ZF 5HP24 five-speed automatic transmission was coupled to the conventionally aspirated 4.0-litre model and a Mercedes W5A580 five-speed transmission to the supercharged version, but in 2002 the new ZF 6HP26 six-speed automatic transmission was fitted in both versions of the 4.2-litre model.
==XK/XKR (2006–2014)==

The second generation of the XK debuted in 2005 at the Frankfurt Motor Show in Germany, styled by Jaguar&#x27;s chief designer Ian Callum. The X150&#x27;s grille was designed to recall the 1961 E-Type. The XK is an evolution of the Advanced Lightweight Coupé (ALC) introduced at the 2005 North American International Auto Show. The XK features a bonded and riveted aluminium chassis shared with the XJ and body panels, both a first for a Jaguar grand tourer. Compared to the XK (X100), the XKR (X150) is wider and is longer. It is also lighter resulting in performance and fuel consumption improvements. Unlike the X100, the X150 has no wood trim on the interior offered as standard equipment. The interior featured steering column mounted shift paddles. A more powerful XKR version having a supercharged variant of the engine was introduced in 2007.

The standard XK model has a limited top speed of while the high performance XKR has the limited top speed increased to .

The XK received a facelift in 2009, with minor alterations to front and rear lights and bumper designs, together with the introduction of a new 5.0-litre V8 for both the naturally aspirated XK and the supercharged XKR. The interior also received some changes, in particular the introduction of the XF style rotary gear selector mated to the new ZF automatic transmission. The XK received a second and more minor facelift in 2011 with new front bumper and light design, which was presented at the New York Auto Show.

A higher performance variant of the XKR, the XKR-S, was introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in 2012. The XKR-S gained an additional 40-horsepower over the XKR bringing the 0–97 km/h (60 mph) acceleration time down to 4.4 seconds and the top speed up to 300 km/h (186 mph). A convertible version of the XKR-S was introduced in 2012.

Production of the XK ended in July 2014 without a replacement model. Most of the tooling is now used on the XK-based F-Type and the two models were produced concurrently on the same line from 2012–2014. However, the F-Type is not a successor to the XK.

<doc id="414668" wikidata="Q264023" url="?curid=414668" title="Hazel Blears">
<text>Hazel Anne Blears (born 14 May 1956) is a British former Labour Party politician, who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) successively for the constituencies of Salford and Salford and Eccles between 1997 and 2015.

One of 101 female Labour MPs elected at the 1997 general election, Blears served in the Cabinet as Minister without Portfolio and Chair of the Labour Party between 2006 and 2007, and Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government from 2007 to 2009, before resigning as a result of the expenses scandal. Commenting on her resignation, Gordon Brown said that Blears had made an &quot;outstanding contribution&quot; to public life.

Blears was re-elected in 2010 and remained a backbencher, before standing down at the 2015 election.

==Early life and education==
Hazel Blears was born in Salford, Lancashire on 14 May 1956, the daughter of Arthur Blears, a maintenance fitter. A five-year old Blears appeared as an extra in iconic English film &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot;, bouncing a ball in the opening credits.

Blears was educated at Worsley Wardley Grammar School in Wardley, Worsley and then Eccles College on Chatsworth Road in Ellesmere Park, Eccles. She went to Trent Polytechnic in Nottingham (now known as Nottingham Trent University), graduating with a BA (Hons) degree in law, and later, the Chester College of Law in 1977.

==Parliamentary career==
Described by journalist Michael White as a &quot;ferociously effective networker&quot;, Blears stood in Tatton in 1987 against Neil Hamilton and in 1992 in Bury South where she lost by 788 votes. At the 1997 general election she was elected as the Labour MP for Salford, her home seat.

After the election she became the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Minister of State at the Department of Health Alan Milburn until 1998. She spent ten months in 1999 as PPS to then Chief Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Smith.

In the run-up to the 2001 general election, Blears was a member and later deputy head of the Labour Party campaign team, a group of backbenchers tasked with campaigning around the country. This raised her national profile.

At the 2010 general election, parliamentary constituencies for Salford and Eccles were restructured, with Blears&#x27;s constituency being abolished. She defeated Ian Stewart in the selection contest to be the Labour Parliamentary Candidate for the new parliamentary constituency of Salford and Eccles, and was elected.

During her parliamentary career, she has acquired the nickname &quot;Chipmunk&quot;. Fraser Nelson, writing in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, has subsequently dubbed her &quot;the Iron Chipmunk&quot;, a play on the phrase &quot;Iron Lady&quot;, often used to describe Margaret Thatcher.

===Ministerial career===
Following the 2001 general election, Blears entered Tony Blair&#x27;s government as the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Health, responsible for Public Health. In this job she launched the Government&#x27;s &quot;5-a-day&quot; campaign to get people to eat more fruit and vegetables.

Blears was promoted in 2003 to Minister of State for Policing, Security and Community Safety. She was elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party in 2003. After the 2005 general election, on 7 June 2005 she became a Member of the Privy Council. In a cabinet reshuffle following council elections on 4 May 2006, Tony Blair appointed her Party Chair, replacing Ian McCartney.

====Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government====

On 28 June 2007, the new Prime Minister Gordon Brown appointed Blears as Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, replacing Ruth Kelly. In April 2008, it was rumoured that Brown was planning a summer reshuffle in which Blears would be demoted. However, when the reshuffle occurred in the autumn, she retained the position.

In May 2008, Blears mistakenly commented on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; that there were 3 million people unemployed in the United Kingdom when Labour came to power in 1997 (the official figure was 1,602,500).

====Deputy Leadership candidate====
On 24 February 2007, she announced her candidacy for the election for Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, making her one of six candidates for the job formerly held by John Prescott. She came last out of six candidates. Harriet Harman won the election on 24 June 2007.

====Resignation from the cabinet====
On 3 June 2009, the day before the 2009 European and local elections, Blears announced she would resign from the cabinet at the next reshuffle. The media noted how, on the day her resignation was announced, she wore a brooch bearing the message &quot;rocking the boat&quot; On 12 June 2009, she expressed her regret at the manner and timing of her resignation in an interview with the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;. Her resignation was one of several from the Labour cabinet that summer, with the government&#x27;s difficulties compounded by poor results in the European elections and poor opinion poll results which were largely blamed on the recession and rising unemployment.

===Ethnic minorities===
In March 2005, while Home Office minister with responsibility for counter-terrorism, Blears implied that section 44 of the Terrorism Act would disproportionally affect Muslims. In response to this and to her seeming endorsement of it, Ray Powell, President of the National Black Police Association, described the minister&#x27;s language as &quot;intemperate and inconsiderate&quot;. &quot;I think it is wrong of her to say they should accept it is used disproportionately. That comment would not be helpful and does not instill confidence within the Muslim community&quot;.

In August 2005, Blears said that the adoption of hyphenated titles such as &#x27;Asian-British&#x27; or &#x27;Indian-British&#x27; as a means of &#x27;rebranding&#x27; ethnic minorities was &quot;among a range of ideas&quot; brought up in meetings with Muslim and other community groups. This proposal was quickly withdrawn by the Home Office, as the government moved to distance itself from the idea.

===Hospital closures===
In 2006, Blears joined in protests against the closure of hospital departments in her constituency, even though these closures were consistent with the policies of the government of which she was a senior member. Health Emergency&#x27;s head of campaigns Geoff Martin said, &quot;there are 29 hospitals up and down the country facing the immediate threat of cuts and closure to key services in 2007. Will Hazel Blears be joining demonstrators on the streets in each of those areas or is this just a classic case of &#x27;not in my back yard&#x27;&quot;?

===Expenses scandal===
In May 2009, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported that Blears had claimed the maximum allowable expenses, within one pound, for three properties, as well as for stays in hotels. She had also claimed £4,874 on furniture, £899 on a new bed and £913 on a new TV, the second such TV in under a year, and the maximum £400 a month in groceries, and many were said to be outraged that she was not prosecuted. Further, Blears had not paid capital gains tax on profit from the sale of a London flat. The property was registered as her main residence with HM Revenue and Customs, but Blears had been claiming MPs&#x27; second home expenses relating to the flat. She had made a £45,000 profit on its sale without paying capital gains tax.

On 12 May, she volunteered to pay the £13,332 capital gains tax she had avoided on the sale of her second home. It was subsequently claimed that Gordon Brown had ordered her to repay the sum.

In Salford, her constituency, she was met by a number of angry protesters and stayed in a local hotel rather than at home.

Following an investigation by Sir Thomas Legg, Blears was told to repay £225 in expenses in relation to a glass shelving unit for her London flat.

===2010–2015: In opposition===
Blears was a member of the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament from September 2010 to March 2015. Blears presented the committee&#x27;s report on privacy and security, carried out following Edward Snowden&#x27;s revelations about global surveillance by the security agencies, to the media.

In 2013, Blears launched the Kids without Connections work experience programme. The programme aims to encourage local businesses across Salford and Eccles to offer work experience to young people aged between 16 and 24 years. The placements were not paid but were a way of providing experience to people unemployed or seeking work. As a direct result of the project 16 of the 42 initial young people on the programme found a full-time job or apprenticeship immediately after the scheme had ended.

She stood down at the 2015 general election, as she had announced.

==Later career==
In May 2015, Blears became a director of The Co-operative Group and a member of the Risk and Audit Committee and Nominations Committee, for which she was paid £60,000 a year for which she was expected a minimum of one or two days&#x27; work per month. In 2016 Blears was appointed Chair of the Social Investment Business. She has also had roles as Chair of the Institute for Dementia at the University of Salford, as an ambassador for the Alzheimer&#x27;s Society, and as a trustee of the Social Mobility Foundation. In September 2020, Blears was appointed as &quot;Social Value Specialist&quot; for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.

==Personal life==
She married Michael Halsall in 1989. They have no children.

In 2005 Blears was a member of a parliamentary tap-dancing troupe known as the Division Belles (a play on the term &quot;division bell&quot;). Other members included Caroline Flint, Beverley Hughes, Laura Moffatt, Meg Munn, Joan Ryan and Dari Taylor.

<text>Robert John Blizzard (31 May 1950 – 5 May 2022) was a British Labour politician who served as member of Parliament (MP) for the Suffolk constituency of Waveney from 1997 until 2010.

==Early life==
Bob Blizzard was born on 31 May 1950 in Bury St Edmunds, West Suffolk, and was educated at Culford School in Bury St Edmunds and the University of Birmingham.

After his education, he became a teacher. In 1973, he became an English teacher at Southfields Secondary School in Gravesend, Kent. He was appointed the Head of the English Department at the Crayford School on Iron Mill Lane in the London Borough of Bexley in 1976. In 1986, he became the Head of English at the Lynn Grove High School in the Gorleston-on-Sea area of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.

==Political career==
Blizzard was elected as a councillor to Waveney District Council in 1987 and became its leader in 1991. He stepped down from the council on his election to Westminster.

He was selected to fight the Conservative-held seat of Waveney at the 1997 general election, which Labour won by a landslide.

Blizzard defeated the sitting MP David Porter by over 12,000 votes, and he was elected as the first Labour MP for Waveney. He made his maiden speech on 10 June 1997.

From 1997 to 1999, he served on the Environmental Audit Select Committee. In 1999, he became the parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to Helene Hayman, Baroness Hayman as minister of state at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

After the 2001 general election, he became PPS to Nick Brown in Brown&#x27;s role as minister for work at the Department for Work and Pensions. Blizzard resigned this position in March 2003 in protest at the Iraq War.

After the 2005 general election, Blizzard was appointed PPS to the Europe minister at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Douglas Alexander, and remained Alexander&#x27;s PPS when his boss became Secretary of State for Transport in 2006.

In the reshuffle following Gordon Brown&#x27;s appointment as prime minister in June 2007, he was promoted to the position of assistant whip.

Following Gordon Brown&#x27;s October 2008 reshuffle, Blizzard was promoted from an assistant whip to a government whip, otherwise known as a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury.

Blizzard chaired several all-party parliamentary groups (APPGs), including the British Offshore Oil and Gas APPG (1997–2007), the Renewable Transport Fuels APPG (2007), the British-Brazilian APPG (1997–2007), the British-Chilean APPG (2005–2007), and the British-Latin America APPG (2004–2007). He also served as secretary of the Jazz Appreciation APPG (2004–2007).

The policy areas in which he had a special interest included energy, employment, health, transport, education and foreign affairs.

==Following 2010 election==
With Labour&#x27;s defeat in the 2010 election, Blizzard lost his seat. Subsequently, he produced a report which provided &quot;an unflinching look at the bad results Labour suffered in the East, and ideas for how Labour can change its policies and the way it does business, to reclaim the ground it has lost&quot;.

==Reselection as Labour&#x27;s candidate and 2015 election==
On 21 October 2011, Blizzard was overwhelmingly selected as Labour&#x27;s prospective parliamentary candidate by the Waveney Constituency Labour Party, winning the ballot on members&#x27; first preference votes. The selection set up a re-run of the 2010 election contest against Peter Aldous. Aldous held the seat with an increased majority, which ended Blizzard&#x27;s political career.

== Death ==
Blizzard died in Norfolk on 10 May 2022. His funeral was held in Lowestoft on 28 May.

<text>David Stanley Borrow (born 2 August 1952) is a British Labour Party politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for South Ribble from 1997 to 2010. He is currently a Labour Party councillor on Preston City Council and was appointed Mayor of Preston on 15 May 2019.

==Education==

Born in Huddersfield, David Borrow was educated at Mirfield Grammar school and the Lanchester Polytechnic (now Coventry University) where he was awarded a degree in economics.

==Political career==
He joined the Labour Party in 1970 aged 18, and in 1973 he became a trainee at the Yorkshire Bank. He was appointed as an assistant clerk at the Lancashire Valuations Tribunal in 1975, being promoted to Deputy Clerk in 1978. He was the Deputy Clerk to the Manchester South Valuations Tribunal in 1981, before becoming the Clerk to The Tribunal at the Merseyside Valuations Tribunal in 1983. David Borrow was elected as a councillor to the Preston Borough Council in 1987, and was the council leader between 1992 and 1994, and again from 1995 until his election to Westminster. He stood down from the council in 1998.

He contested the parliamentary seat of Wyre at the 1992 General Election and he finished second 11,664 votes behind the Conservative MP Keith Mans. At the 1997 General Election David Borrow contested South Ribble, the seat of the former Conservative Minister of State|minister Robert Atkins. Borrow was selected to fight the seat at the last minute after the previous candidate fell ill. South Ribble was one of the many seats which was won by Labour in 1997, and David Borrow was elected to serve as the Labour Member of Parliament for the South Ribble constituency with a majority of 5,084, and held the seat until 2010. He made his maiden speech on 3 July 1997.

He joined the Agriculture Select committee in 1999, and after the 2001 General Election he joined the newly formed Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee. In 2003 he became the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Minister of State at the Department for Transport Kim Howells, and remained so when his boss moved sideways to the Department for Education and Skills in 2004. He did not remain as Howells&#x27;s PPS after the 2005 General Election.

He was formerly a member of the Defence Select Committee.

==Personal life==
Borrow is an openly gay man. He came out publicly in 1998 to be able to speak honestly during the age of consent campaign and raise issues that are important to all lesbians and gay men. He also contributed articles to the gay rights magazine &quot;Outcast&quot;.

He entered into a civil partnership with John Garland, his long standing partner, in May 2006, the first MP to do so.

<text>Operation Rheinübung () was the last sortie into the Atlantic by the new German battleship and heavy cruiser on 18–27 May 1941, during World War II. This operation aimed to disrupt Allied shipping to the United Kingdom as the previously successful Operation Berlin had done. After &quot;Bismarck&quot; had sunk HMS &quot;Hood&quot; during the Battle of the Denmark Strait (24 May), it culminated with the sinking of the &quot;Bismarck&quot; (27 May), while &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; escaped to port in occupied France. From that point on, Germans would rely only on U-boats to wage the Battle of the Atlantic.

==Background==
During both World Wars, Britain relied heavily on merchant ships to import food, fuel, and raw materials, such things were crucial both for civilian survival and the military effort. Protecting this lifeline was a high priority for British forces, as its disruption would significantly weaken the British economy and its military capabilities, and Britain might be forced to negotiate peace, seek an armistice, or reduce its capacity to resist if this supply line could be severed. Such an outcome would shift the balance of power in Europe decisively, potentially giving Germany control over Western Europe without a nearby base of opposition.

Germany&#x27;s naval leadership (under Admiral Erich Johann Albert Raeder) at the time firmly believed that defeat by blockade was achievable. However, they also believed that the primary method to achieve this objective was to use traditional commerce raiding tactics, founded upon surface combatants (cruisers, battle-cruisers, fast battleships) that were only &quot;supported&quot; by submarines. Regardless of the method or manner, Raeder convinced the High Command (OKW) and Hitler that if this lifeline were severed, Britain would be defeated, regardless of any other factors.

Operation Rheinübung was the latest in a series of raids on Allied shipping carried out by surface units of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. It was preceded by Operation Berlin, a highly successful sortie by and which ended in March 1941.

By May 1941, the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; battleships &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; were at Brest, on the western coast of France, posing a serious threat to the Atlantic convoys, and were heavily bombed by the Royal Air Force. The original plan was to have both ships involved in the operation, but &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was undergoing major repairs to her engines, and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; had just suffered a damaging torpedo hit days before, which put her out of action for 6 months. This left just two new warships available to the Germans: the battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot; and the heavy cruiser &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; (while the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; had three serviceable light cruisers, none had the endurance necessary for a long Atlantic operation), both initially stationed in the Baltic Sea.

The aim of the operation was for &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; to break into the Atlantic and attack Allied shipping. Grand Admiral Erich Raeder&#x27;s orders to Admiral Günther Lütjens were that &quot;the objective of the &quot;Bismarck&quot; is not to defeat enemies of equal strength, but to tie them down in a delaying action, while preserving her combat capacity as much as possible, so as to allow &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; to get at the merchant ships in the convoy&quot; and &quot;The primary target in this operation is the enemy&#x27;s merchant shipping; enemy warships will be engaged only when that objective makes it necessary and it can be done without excessive risk&quot;.

To support and provide facilities for the capital ships to refuel and rearm, German Naval Command (OKM) established a network of tankers and supply ships in the &quot;Rheinübung&quot; operational area. Seven tankers and two supply ships were sent as far afield as Labrador in the west and the Cape Verde Islands in the south.

Lütjens had requested that Raeder delay &quot;Rheinübung&quot; long enough either for &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; to complete repairs to her engines and be made combat-worthy, allowing her to rendezvous at sea with &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;; or for &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s sister ship to accompany them. Raeder had refused, as &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; would not be made ready to sail until early July. The crew of the newly completed &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was not yet fully trained, and over Lütjens&#x27;s protests, Raeder ordered &quot;Rheinübung&quot; to go ahead. Raeder&#x27;s principal reason for going ahead was his knowledge of the upcoming Operation Barbarossa, where the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; was going to play only a small, supporting role. Raeder&#x27;s desire was to score a major success with a battleship before &quot;Barbarossa&quot;, an act that might impress upon Hitler the need not to cut the budget for capital ships.

To meet the threat from German surface ships, the British had stationed at Scapa Flow the new battleships and as well as the battlecruiser and the newly commissioned aircraft carrier . Elsewhere, Force H at Gibraltar could muster the battlecruiser and the aircraft carrier ; at sea in the Atlantic on various duties were the older battleships and , the 16 inch gun-armed and the older battlecruiser . Cruisers and air patrols provided the fleet&#x27;s &quot;eyes&quot;. At sea, or due to sail shortly, were 11 convoys, including a troop convoy.

OKM did not take into account the Royal Navy&#x27;s determination to destroy the German surface fleet. To ensure that &quot;Bismarck&quot; was sunk, the Royal Navy would ruthlessly strip other theatres of vessels. This would include denuding valuable convoys of their escorts. The British would ultimately deploy six battleships, three battlecruisers, two aircraft carriers, 16 cruisers, 33 destroyers and eight submarines, along with patrol aircraft. It would become the largest naval force assigned to a single operation up to that point in the war.

==&quot;Rheinübung&quot;==
===&quot;Bismarck&quot; sails===

The heavy cruiser &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; sailed at about 21:00 on 18 May 1941 from Gotenhafen (Gdynia, Poland), followed at 2:00 a.m., 19 May, by &quot;Bismarck&quot;. Both ships proceeded under escort, separately and rendezvoused off Cape Arkona on Rügen Island in the western Baltic, where the destroyers Z23 and Z16 &quot;Friedrich Eckoldt&quot; joined them. They then proceeded through the Danish Islands into the Kattegat. Entering the Kattegat on 20 May &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; sailed north toward the Skagerrak, the strait between Jutland and Southern Norway, where they were sighted by the Swedish aircraft-carrying cruiser on around 1:00 p.m. &quot;Gotland&quot; forwarded the sighting in a routine report. Earlier, around noon, a flight of Swedish aircraft also detected the German vessels and likewise reported their sighting.

On 21 May the Admiralty was alerted by sources in the Swedish government that two large German warships had been seen in the Kattegat. The ships entered the North Sea and took a brief refuge in Grimstadfjord near Bergen, Norway on 21 May where &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; was topped off with fuel, making a break for the Atlantic shipping lanes on 22 May. By this time, &quot;Hood&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, with escorting destroyers, were en route to the Denmark Strait, where two cruisers, and were already patrolling. The cruisers and had been sent to guard the waters south-east of Iceland.

Once the departure of the German ships was discovered, Admiral Sir John Tovey, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Home Fleet, sailed with &quot;King George V&quot;, &quot;Victorious&quot; and their escorts to support those already at sea. &quot;Repulse&quot; joined soon afterwards.

On the evening of 23 May, &quot;Suffolk&quot; sighted &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; in the Denmark Strait, close to the Greenland coast. &quot;Suffolk&quot; immediately sought cover in a fog bank and alerted The Admiralty. &quot;Bismarck&quot; opened fire on &quot;Norfolk&quot; at a range of six miles but &quot;Norfolk&quot; escaped into fog. &quot;Norfolk&quot; and &quot;Suffolk&quot;, outgunned, shadowed the German ships using radar. No hits were scored but the concussion of the main guns firing at &quot;Norfolk&quot; had knocked out &quot;Bismarck&quot;&#x27;s radar causing Lütjens to re-position &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; ahead of &quot;Bismarck&quot;. After the German ships were sighted, British naval groups were redirected to either intercept Lütjens&#x27; force or to cover a troop convoy.

===Battle of the Denmark Strait===

&quot;Hood&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; made contact with the German force early on the morning of 24 May, and the action started at 5:52 a.m., with the combatants about apart. Gunners onboard Hood initially mistook &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; that was now in the lead for &quot;Bismarck&quot; and opened fire on her; Captain Leach commanding &quot;HMS Prince of Wales&quot; realised Vice-Admiral Holland&#x27;s error and engaged Bismarck from the outset. Both German ships were firing at &quot;Hood&quot;. &quot;Hood&quot; suffered an early hit from &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; which started a rapidly spreading fire amidships.

Then, at about 6 a.m., one or more of &quot;Hood&quot;&#x27;s magazines exploded, probably as the result of a direct hit by a shell from &quot;Bismarck&quot;. The massive explosion broke the great battlecruiser&#x27;s back, and she sank within minutes. All but three of her 1,418-man crew died, including Vice Admiral Lancelot Holland, commanding officer of the squadron.

&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; continued the action, but suffered multiple hits with and shells, and experienced repeated mechanical failures with her main armament. Her commanding officer, Captain Leach, was wounded when one of &quot;Bismarck&#x27;&quot;s shells struck &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;&#x27; bridge. Leach broke off the action, and the British battleship retreated under cover of a smokescreen.

&quot;Bismarck&quot; had been hit three times but Admiral Lütjens overruled &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s Captain Ernst Lindemann who wanted to pursue the damaged &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and finish her off. All of the hits on &quot;Bismarck&quot; had been inflicted by &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;″ guns. One of the hits had penetrated the German battleship&#x27;s hull near the bow, rupturing some of her fuel tanks, causing her to leak oil continuously and at a serious rate. This was to be a critical factor as the pursuit continued, forcing &quot;Bismarck&quot; to make for Brest instead of escaping into the great expanse of the Atlantic. The resulting oil slick also helped the British cruisers to shadow her.

===The pursuit===
&quot;Norfolk&quot; and &quot;Suffolk&quot; and the damaged &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; continued to shadow the Germans, reporting their position to draw British forces to the scene. In response, it was decided that the undamaged &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; would detach to continue raiding, while &quot;Bismarck&quot; drew off the pursuit. In conjunction with this, Admiral Dönitz committed the U-boat arm to support &quot;Bismarck&quot; with all available U-boats in the Atlantic. He organised two patrol lines to trap the Home Fleet should &quot;Bismarck&quot; lead her pursuers to them. One line of 7 boats was arrayed in mid-Atlantic while another, of 8 boats, was stationed west of the Bay of Biscay. At 6:40 p.m. on 24 May, &quot;Bismarck&quot; turned on her pursuers and briefly opened fire to cover the escape of &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;. The German cruiser slipped away undamaged.

At 10 p.m., &quot;Victorious&quot; was away and launched an air attack with nine Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers, which were guided in by &quot;Norfolk&quot;. In poor weather, and against heavy fire, they attacked and made a single torpedo hit under the bridge. However, up against strong belt armour and anti-torpedo bulges, it failed to cause substantial damage. The attacking aircraft were all safely recovered by &quot;Victorious&quot;, despite poor weather, darkness, aircrew inexperience and the failure of the carrier&#x27;s homing beacon.

At 3 a.m. on 25 May, the British shadowers lost contact with &quot;Bismarck&quot;. At first, it was thought that she would return to the North Sea, and ships were directed accordingly. Then Lütjens, believing that he was still being shadowed by the British, broke radio silence by sending a long radio message to headquarters in Germany. This allowed the British to triangulate &quot;Bismarck&quot;&#x27;s approximate position and send aircraft to hunt for the German battleship. By the time that it was realised that Lütjens was heading for Brest, &quot;Bismarck&quot; had broken the naval cordon and gained a lead. By 11 p.m., Lütjens was well to the east of Tovey&#x27;s force and had managed to evade &quot;Rodney&quot;. &quot;Bismarck&quot; was short of fuel due to the damaging hit inflicted by &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; which had caused Lütjens to reduce speed to conserve fuel but &quot;Bismarck&quot; still had enough speed to outrun the heavy units of the Home Fleet and reach the safety of France. From the south, however, Somerville&#x27;s Force H with the carrier &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, the battlecruiser &quot;Renown&quot;, and the light cruiser HMS &quot;Sheffield&quot; were approaching to intercept.

The British ships were also beginning to run low on fuel, and the escape of &quot;Bismarck&quot; seemed more and more certain. However, at 10:30 a.m. on 26 May, a PBY Catalina flying-boat, based at Lough Erne, Northern Ireland, found &quot;Bismarck&quot;. She was from Brest and not within range of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; air cover.
This contact was taken over by two Swordfish from &quot;Ark Royal&quot;. This carrier now launched an airstrike, but her aircrew were unaware of &quot;Sheffield&quot;&#x27;s proximity to &quot;Bismarck&quot;, mistook the British cruiser for the German battleship and therefore immediately attacked her. Their torpedoes had been fitted with influence detonators, and several of them exploded prematurely. Others missed their target, and the attacking aircraft then received a warning from &quot;Ark Royal&quot; that &quot;Sheffield&quot; was in the vicinity, whereupon the Swordfish finally recognised the cruiser and broke off the attack.

&quot;Ark Royal&quot; now launched, in almost impossibly bad weather conditions for air operations, and from a distance of less than 40 miles upwind of &quot;Bismarck&quot;, a second strike consisting of 15 Swordfish. These were carrying torpedoes equipped with the standard and reliable contact detonators. The attack resulted in two or three hits on the German ship, one of which inflicted critical damage on her steering. A jammed rudder now meant she could now only sail &quot;away&quot; from her intended destination of Brest. At midnight, Lütjens signalled his headquarters: &quot;Ship unmanoeuvrable. We shall fight to the last shell. Long live the Führer.&quot;

===&quot;Bismarck&quot;″s end===

The battleships &quot;Rodney&quot; and &quot;King George V&quot; waited for daylight on 27 May before attacking. At 8:47 a.m., they opened fire, quickly hitting &quot;Bismarck&quot;. Her gunners achieved near misses on &quot;Rodney&quot;, but the British ships had silenced Bismarck&#x27;s main guns within half an hour. Despite close-range shelling by &quot;Rodney&quot;, a list to port, and widespread fires, &quot;Bismarck&quot; did not sink.

According to David Mearns and James Cameron&#x27;s underwater surveys in recent years the British main guns achieved only four hits on &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s main armoured belt, two through the upper armour belt on the starboard side from &quot;King George V&quot; and two on the port side from &quot;Rodney&quot;. These four hits occurred at about 10:00 a.m., at close range, causing heavy casualties among the sheltering crew.

Nearly out of fuel – and mindful of possible U-boat attacks – the British battleships left for home. The heavy cruiser attacked with torpedoes and made three hits. Scuttling charges were soon set off by German sailors, and at 10:40 a.m., &quot;Bismarck&quot; capsized and sank. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; and the destroyer rescued 110 survivors. After an hour, rescue work was abruptly ended when there were reports of a U-boat presence. Another three survivors were picked up by and two by the German weather ship . Over 2,000 died, including Captain Lindemann and Admiral Lütjens.

==Aftermath==
After separating from &quot;Bismarck&quot;, &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; went further south into the Atlantic, intending to continue the commerce raiding mission. On 26 May, with just 160 tons of fuel left, she rendezvoused with the tanker &quot;Spichern&quot; and refuelled. On 27 May, she developed engine trouble, which worsened over the next few days. On 28 May, she received a further refueling from &quot;Esso Hamburg&quot;. With her speed reduced to , it was no longer considered practicable to continue. She abandoned her commerce raiding mission without sinking any merchant ships, and made her way to Brest, arriving on 1 June where she remained under repair until the end of 1941. She later escaped from France with two other German battleships during the Channel Dash.

In the action, just two U-boats had sighted the British forces, and neither was able to attack. In the aftermath, the British ships were able to evade the patrol lines as they returned to base; there were no further U-boat contacts. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; also organized sorties against the Home Fleet, but none were successful until 28 May, when planes from &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 77 attacked and sank the destroyer .

After &quot;Rheinübung&quot;, a recent breakthrough into the Kriegsmarine&#x27;s enigma network enabled the Royal Navy to mount a concerted effort to round up the network of supply ships deployed to refuel and rearm the &quot;Rheinübung&quot; ships. The first success came on 3 June, when the tanker &quot;Belchen&quot; was discovered by the cruisers and south of Greenland. On 4 June the tanker &quot;Gedania&quot; was found in mid-Atlantic by &quot;Marsdale&quot;, while east the supply ship &quot;Gonzenheim&quot; was caught by the armed merchant cruiser , and aircraft from &quot;Victorious&quot;. On the same day in the south Atlantic, midway between Belém and Freetown, the southernmost limit of the &quot;Rheinübung&quot; operation, the tanker &quot;Esso Hamburg&quot; was intercepted by the cruiser ; while the following day &quot;London&quot;, accompanied by , sank the tanker &quot;Egerland&quot;. A week later, on 12 June, the tanker &quot;Friederich Breme&quot; was sunk by the cruiser HMS &quot;Sheffield&quot; in the mid-Atlantic. On 15 June, the tanker &quot;Lothringen&quot; was sunk by the cruiser , with aircraft from . In just over two weeks, 7 of the 9 supply ships assigned to Operation Rheinübung had been accounted for, with serious consequences for future German surface operations.

==Conclusion==
Operation Rheinübung was a failure, and although the Germans scored a success by sinking &quot;The Mighty Hood&quot;, this was offset with the loss of the modern battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;, which represented one-quarter of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;″s capital ships. No merchant ships were sunk or even sighted by the German heavy surface units during the 2-week raid. Allied convoys were not seriously disrupted; most convoys sailed according to schedule, and there was no diminution of supplies to Britain. On the other hand, the Atlantic U-boat campaign was disrupted; boats in the Atlantic sank just 2 ships in the last weeks of May, compared to 29 at the beginning of the month. As a result of &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s sinking, Hitler forbade any further Atlantic sorties, and her sister ship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was sent to Norway. The &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; was never again able to mount a major surface operation against Allied supply routes in the North Atlantic; henceforth its only weapon was the U-boat campaign.

<text>Timothy Eric Boswell, Baron Boswell of Aynho (born 2 December 1942) is a British politician who was the Conservative MP for Daventry from 1987 until he stood down at the 2010 general election, after which he was appointed to the House of Lords as a life peer.

==Personal life==

The son of a farmer, Tim Boswell was educated at Marlborough College and New College, Oxford, where he obtained a degree in Classics and a diploma in agricultural economics.

Boswell was married to Helen Delahay Boswell, née Rees, for 50 years until her death in 2019. They had three daughters together including the former Conservative Member of Parliament Victoria Prentis.

==Political career==
===Conservative Party===
He joined the Conservative Research Department in 1966, becoming head of the economics section in 1974. He stood for Parliament at the February 1974 general election in Rugby but lost by 6,154 votes to Labour&#x27;s William Price.

He was elected as the Treasurer of the Daventry Conservative Association in 1976 and subsequently its Chairman from 1979 to 1983. He became a political advisor to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Michael Jopling for two years from 1984.

===House of Commons===
Boswell was chosen to contest the Daventry constituency after the sitting Conservative MP Reg Prentice announced his retirement. He was elected as the Conservative MP for Daventry at the 1987 general election with a majority of 19,690 and held the safe seat comfortably until his retirement from the House of Commons.

Tim Boswell&#x27;s Westminster career began unsurprisingly as a Member of the Agriculture Select committee in 1987. He became the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Financial Secretary to the Treasury Peter Lilley in 1989. Tim Boswell entered John Major&#x27;s government in 1990 as an Assistant Government Whip, following the 1992 general election he was promoted within the Whip&#x27;s Office and became a Lord Commissioner to the Treasury.

In December 1992, Tim Boswell was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Education and moved in the same position at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food until the Major government fell at the 1997 general election.

In opposition Boswell was a spokesman on the Treasury in the immediate aftermath of the 1997 election defeat and became a spokesman on Trade and Industry under William Hague, before speaking on Education and Employment in 1999 until after the 2001 general election. He became the spokesman for Work and Pensions under the leadership of Iain Duncan Smith, moving briefly to speak on Constitutional Affairs in 2003 under Michael Howard and back to Work and Pensions in 2004, where he remained following the 2005 general election.

On 31 March 2006, Boswell announced his intention not to contest the subsequent general election, provided it did not take place unexpectedly soon. The Daventry seat was split in two at the 2010 general election, with the northern portion becoming part of a new Daventry constituency and the southern part becoming part of a South Northamptonshire constituency.

In May 2009, he was listed by &quot;The Telegraph&quot; as one of the &quot;Saints&quot; in the expenses scandal.

After his retirement from the House of Commons the seat remained Conservative under Chris Heaton-Harris.

===House of Lords===
He was raised to the House of Lords as a Conservative Life peer being created Baron Boswell of Aynho, of Aynho in the County of Northamptonshire on 8 July 2010. In May 2012, he resigned the Conservative whip after being made Principal Deputy Chairman of Committees in the House. He also became Chairman of the European Union Committee.

==Honours==
On 10 March 2016, Boswell was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA). He was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Northamptonshire in 2010.

<doc id="414681" wikidata="Q5584360" url="?curid=414681" title="Peter Bradley (politician)">
<text>Peter Charles Stephen Bradley (born 12 April 1953) is an English Labour Party politician. He was the Member of Parliament for The Wrekin between 1997 and 2005.

==Early life==
Bradley was born in Erdington, Birmingham, on 12 April 1953 to Fred Bradley (1915-2004), born Fritz Brandes, and his wife Trudie Bradley. His father arrived in England in 1939 as a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany, whose story Bradley only came to know fully following his father&#x27;s death in 2004. His paternal grandparents Salamon and Bertha Brandes, who formerly ran a drapery business in Bamberg, Bavaria, were deported in 1941 to German-occupied Latvia, where his grandmother was executed in a massacre in Riga and his grandfather was last heard of alive doing forced labour in a peat bog.

Bradley was educated at Abingdon School – where he was a classmate of Francis Maude – and the University of Sussex, followed by Occidental College, Los Angeles. Before entering Parliament, he was managing director of Millbank Consultants Ltd (1993–97) and previously a director of Good Relations Ltd (1986–93) prior to which he was the research director at the Centre for Contemporary Studies (1979–86).

==Political career==
===Labour councillor===
As a member of Westminster Council and deputy Leader of the Labour Group, he was a leader of the campaign to expose the &#x27;Homes for Votes&#x27; scandal which led eventually to the surcharging of the former Conservative Council Leader Dame Shirley Porter and colleagues in 1996.

===Member of Parliament===

Bradley was elected to the constituency of The Wrekin in Shropshire in the 1997 general election. Major boundary changes took effect ahead of that election, which created a new constituency containing and named after the town of Telford, before which Telford had been one of the largest elements of The Wrekin. The incumbent Labour MP for The Wrekin, Bruce Grocott, decided to stand for the new Telford seat in the 1997 general election. The new Telford constituency took 62.9% of the electorate of The Wrekin, leaving the remaining 37.1% to constitute a revised constituency of The Wrekin that incorporated areas previously within Shropshire North and Ludlow from two sides. This meant that although Labour won the largely Telford-based version of the constituency in the previous general election of 1992, the new constituency which was much more rural was likely to have been won by the Conservatives in 1992 if it had existed then.

In Parliament, he founded and chaired the Rural Group of Labour MPs which played a major part in shaping the Government&#x27;s Rural White Paper and was subsequently appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to Alun Michael. His involvement in the bill to ban hunting led to his constituency being targeted by the Countryside Party at the 2005 election. He was also a target of the strategy led by Lord Ashcroft to concentrate resources on key marginal seats which saw £50,000 donated to the Conservative campaign to unseat him.

Known for his campaigning commitment and skill, he secured a saving of £240 million in the annual NHS drugs budget following a successful campaign to regulate pharmaceutical company practices (2001). He also promoted the &quot;Members of Parliament (Employment Disqualification) Bill&quot; which sought to prevent MPs from neglecting their Parliamentary duties in pursuit of parallel careers (2002) and the &quot;Right to Reply &amp; Press Standards Bill&quot; (2005) which, with the support of the NUJ, MediaWise and the Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom attempted to provide stronger protection to members of the public affected by misrepresentation in the press and to introduce controls on journalists&#x27; excesses. In 2011, he submitted evidence to the Leveson Inquiry based on the substance of the Bill. With Alan Whitehead MP, he was also credited with negotiating the restoration of the student grant through the &quot;Higher Education Act&quot; (2004). He was a member of the Public Administration Select Committee, 1997–9, which played a major role in the development and passage of the &quot;Freedom of Information Act 2000&quot;. He subsequently lost his seat to Conservative politician Mark Pritchard.

Since leaving Parliament, he was a member of the Affordable Rural Housing Commission (2005–06) and subsequently of the Government&#x27;s Rural Housing Advisory Group (2007–08).

==Charity work==
He is a co-founder and director of the Speakers&#x27; Corner Trust, a registered charity promoting free expression, public debate and active citizenship as a means of revitalising civil society in the UK as well as in Berlin, Prague and Nigeria.

==Personal life==
Bradley is married to Annie (&quot;née&quot; Hart), a teacher. They have two children. Bradley is a member of Warwickshire County Cricket Club and supports Aston Villa F.C. He is also an honorary patron of A.F.C. Telford United football club.

He published a book about his father&#x27;s experiences on 12 May 2022, &quot;The Last Train - A Family&#x27;s History of the Final Solution&quot;.

<text>Graham Stuart Brady, Baron Brady of Altrincham, (born 20 May 1967), is a British politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Altrincham and Sale West from 1997 to 2024. A member of the Conservative Party, he was the chairman of the 1922 Committee from 2010 to 2024, except for a brief period during the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election.

Brady served as a shadow minister under four Conservative leaders before resigning in 2007 in protest at David Cameron&#x27;s opposition to grammar schools. On 1 December 2010, Brady was voted &quot;Backbencher of the Year&quot; by &quot;The Spectator&quot; at its annual parliamentary awards.

During his tenure as 1922 Committee chairman, Brady has overseen the election of three Conservative Party leaders and Prime Ministers (Theresa May, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak) as well as votes of no confidence in May and Boris Johnson.

Brady stepped down as an MP at the 2024 general election and was appointed to the House of Lords.

==Early life and education==
Graham Brady was born on 20 May 1967 in Salford, Lancashire, the son of an accountant and his wife a medical secretary. The family then moved to nearby Trafford. He was educated at Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, where he was deputy head boy, before studying law at the University of Durham, at St Aidan&#x27;s College, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1989.

Brady was highly active in politics as a student. He served as Chairman of the Durham University Conservative Association (DUCA) for the 1987–1988 academic year and was one of six students elected to represent Durham at the annual NUS conference. He served additionally as Chairman of Northern Area Conservative Students (1987–1989) and as a member of the Conservative Party&#x27;s National Union Executive Committee (1988–1989).

==Early career==
Brady was appointed a consultant in public relations with Shandwick plc in 1989. He joined the Centre for Policy Studies in 1990. He was appointed director of public affairs at the Waterfront Partnership in 1992, where he remained until he was elected to the House of Commons in 1997. He was vice-chairman of the East Berkshire Conservative Association from 1993 to 1995.

==Parliamentary career==
Brady was selected to contest the Altrincham and Sale West, following the retirement of the Conservative MP Fergus Montgomery. Brady was elected as MP for Altrincham and Sale West at the 1997 general election with 43.2% of the vote and a majority of 1,505. He was the youngest Conservative MP to be elected in 1997, having been elected just before his 30th birthday. In the party leadership election that followed, Brady supported Michael Howard.

Brady made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 2 June 1997. From 1997 to 2001 he was a member of the Education and Employment Select Committee and its Employment Sub-Committee. He was joint secretary of the Conservative Party Committee for Education and Employment from 1997 to 2000.

In 1998 Brady made enquiries to John Bourn, at the time Comptroller and Auditor General, on his decision not to publish a National Audit Office report on the controversial Al-Yamamah arms deal. The same year, Brady was one of only 13 Conservative MPs who voted in favour of an equal age of consent. He was a member of the executive of the 1922 Committee from 1998 to 2000.

Brady became Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Chairman of the Conservative Party, Michael Ancram in 1999. He was made an Opposition Whip by William Hague in 2000. In February 2000, Brady complained about anti-grammar school literature circulated to parents in Altrincham by Michael Evans, then head of Trinity Church of England High School, arguing that this violated rules about public funds being used for campaign material – a complaint subsequently upheld by Secretary of State for Education David Blunkett. That same year Brady became an opposition spokesman on Education and Employment.

Brady was re-elected as MP for Altrincham and Sale West at the 2001 general election with an increased vote share of 46.2% and an increased majority of 2,941.

Following the election, Brady continued as an opposition spokesman on Education and Skills under the leadership of both Hague and Iain Duncan Smith. He became the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Michael Howard, in 2003, and an opposition spokesman on foreign affairs and Shadow Europe Minister in 2004. From 2004 to 2005 he was a member of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Select Committee and its Urban Affairs Sub-Committee. He was vice-chair of the all-party Montserrat Group from 2006. He became a member of the Treasury Select Committee and rejoined the executive of the 1922 Committee in 2007.

At the 2005 general election, Brady was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 46.4% and an increased majority of 7,159.

On 29 May 2007, Brady resigned his post as Shadow Minister for Europe in protest at Conservative leader David Cameron&#x27;s opposition to grammar schools. He told the BBC that &quot;faced with a choice between a front bench position that I have loved and doing what I believe to be right for my constituents and for the many hundreds of thousands of families who are ill-served by state education in this country, there is in conscience only one option open to me&quot;, and argued that &quot;grammar schools in selective areas are exactly the motor that does drive social mobility more effectively than comprehensive areas&quot;. Brady&#x27;s own constituency has retained a selective rather than comprehensive education system.

Brady was secretary of the all-party Fluoridation Group and Infrastructure Group from 2008. From 2009 he was treasurer of the all-party Thailand Group and vice-chairman of the Cannabis and Children Group.

At the 2010 general election, Brady was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 48.9% and an increased majority of 11,595. 

In 2013, he opposed the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013, raising concerns that the measure had not been in the Conservative manifesto and that religious freedom could be compromised.

At the 2015 general election, Brady was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 53% and an increased majority of 13,290.

In the 2016 EU referendum, he was a supporter of Brexit.

At the snap 2017 general election, Brady was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 51% and a decreased majority of 6,426.

In July 2018, it was reported that Brady served as editor of &quot;The House&quot;, the in-house Parliamentary magazine, earning a salary of £26,000 for the role.

Brady was again re-elected at the 2019 general election with a decreased vote share of 48% and a decreased majority of 6,139.

In 2024, he was elected as the president of the Northern Ireland Conservatives party.

=== 1922 Committee ===

Brady succeeded Sir Michael Spicer as Chairman of the 1922 Committee on 26 May 2010.

The committee, sometimes known as &quot;The 1922&quot; for short, is the parliamentary group of the Conservative Party and has a central role in the election of the Leader of the Conservative Party. Since 2010 Brady oversaw the election of 4 Conservative Leaders (Theresa May in 2016, Boris Johnson in 2019, Liz Truss in 2022 and Rishi Sunak in 2022) all of whom became the Prime Minister since the Conservative Party had been in office throughout his tenure as chairman.

He resigned as 1922 Committee chairman on 24 May 2019 in order to explore launching a bid to become leader of the Conservative Party in the weeks that followed, but ultimately opted not to run for Leader. His Deputy Chairmen Cheryl Gillan and Charles Walker oversaw the 2019 leadership contest which resulted in the election of Boris Johnson.

Brady temporarily returned to the 1922 Committee on 3 September 2019, to serve as its acting Chairman &quot;until a new executive is elected in the next session of Parliament&quot;. He was subsequently re-elected as the permanent chair on 20 January 2020.

Brady&#x27;s role as Chairman of the 1922 has given him a high public profile, as it falls to him to announce the results of each leadership election or challenge, and this is often followed on live TV and streaming around the world.

In 2022, Brady became the longest-ever serving Chairman of the 1922 Committee, surpassing Edward du Cann.

=== Legislation ===

==== Brexit: anti-Northern Ireland backstop amendment ====

On 29 January 2019, the House of Commons voted 317 to 301 to approve Brady&#x27;s amendment to the Brexit Next Steps motion, which called for &quot;the Northern Ireland backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border, supports leaving the European Union with a deal and would therefore support the Withdrawal Agreement subject to this change&quot;.

==== COVID-19 lockdowns ====
In May 2020, Brady called for the removal of &quot;arbitrary rules and limitations on freedom&quot; brought in by the government because of the COVID-19 pandemic. He said that the British public had been &quot;a little too willing to stay at home&quot;. Speaking out against a second lockdown, he also spoke about COVID-related mental health issues, such as increased rates of suicide and domestic abuse, as well as excess deaths caused due to reduced access for care. Brady is also a steering committee member of the lockdown-sceptic COVID Recovery Group, a group of Conservative MPs who oppose the UK government&#x27;s December 2020 lockdown. The Telegraph reported that the group was seen in Westminster as an &quot;echo&quot; of the Brexiteer European Research Group (ERG) of MPs, and a response by backbench Conservatives to Nigel Farage&#x27;s anti-lockdown Reform UK party.

===Peerage===
After standing down as an MP at the 2024 general election, Brady was nominated for a life peerage in the 2024 Dissolution Honours. He was created Baron Brady of Altrincham, of Birch-in-Rusholme in the County of Greater Manchester, on 19 August 2024.

In 2024 he published a memoir of his time leading the 1922 Committee, entitled &quot;Kingmaker&quot;.

==Personal life==
Brady met Victoria Lowther at Durham University. The couple married in 1992, and have a daughter and a son. They divide their time between homes in London and Altrincham; his wife works as his senior parliamentary assistant.

==Honours==
Brady was made a Freeman of Altrincham in September 2016 for services to the community of Altrincham and its environs. 

Brady was knighted for political and public service in the 2018 New Year Honours. His investiture by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, took place at Buckingham Palace on 6 March 2018.

Brady was sworn as a member of the Privy Council (PC) in November 2023. The same month, he was admitted as a freeman of the City of London.

<text>Thomas Anthony Brake (born 6 May 1962) is a British Liberal Democrat politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Carshalton and Wallington in London from 1997 to 2019.

He was appointed Director of the cross party pressure group Unlock Democracy in October 2020.

==Early life==
Brake was born in Melton Mowbray and moved to France when he was eight. He was educated at the Lycée International school in Saint-Germain-en-Laye in the western suburbs of Paris, and Imperial College London, where he obtained a BSc in Physics in 1983. He was a computer software consultant with Hoskyns (Capgemini) from 1983 until his election to the UK Parliament in 1997.

==Political career==

===Early career===
Brake was actively involved in human rights issues as a student. He was elected as a councillor in the London Borough of Hackney in 1988, leaving the council in 1990. In 1994 Brake was elected as a councillor in the London Borough of Sutton and sat on the council until 1998.

Brake stood for election to Parliament at the 1992 general election in Carshalton and Wallington, but was defeated by Conservative Nigel Forman.

===Parliamentary career===
In what proved to be a close contest, Brake was elected at the 1997 general election as the Liberal Democrat MP for Carshalton and Wallington, beating Nigel Forman with a majority of 2,267, and remained MP there until he lost the seat at the 2019 general election. He made his maiden speech on 10 June 1997. Brake defeated Conservative Ken Andrew in 2001, 2005 and again in 2010 with an increased majority. In 2015 his majority was reduced to 1,510, narrowly ahead of Conservative Matthew Maxwell-Scott.

After the 1997 election, party leader Paddy Ashdown placed Brake on the frontbench as a spokesman on the Environment, Transport and the Regions. Following the 2001 General Election, then party leader Charles Kennedy appointed him a spokesman on Transport, Local Government and the Regions. In 2002 he became a Transport spokesman. He joined the Liberal Democrat frontbench team in 2003 as the lead International Development spokesman. After the 2005 General Election he became the Transport spokesman. He was relieved of this position under the new leadership of Sir Menzies Campbell in March 2006, and later that year became spokesperson for local government. In 2007 Brake became spokesperson for London and the Olympics. In 2008 he was also appointed as a Home Affairs spokesperson.

In June 2010 Brake was named Co-Chair of the new Liberal Democrat Backbench Committee on Home Affairs, Justice and Equalities. Brake Co-Chaired the committee alongside Baroness Hamwee and Lord Thomas of Gresford OBE QC.

In September 2010 Brake attempted to introduce a bill &quot;to amend the Freedom of Information Act 2000 to remove provisions permitting Ministers to overrule decisions of the Information Commissioner and Information Tribunal; to limit the time allowed for public authorities to respond to requests involving consideration of the public interest; to amend the definition of public authorities; and for connected purposes.&quot;

On 11 June 2011, it was announced Brake would be appointed a Privy Counsellor in the Queen&#x27;s 2011 Birthday Honours list.

On 4 September 2012 he was appointed Deputy Leader of the House of Commons, replacing Liberal Democrat David Heath MP who was promoted to Minister of State in DEFRA. Before he was appointed Deputy Leader of the House of Commons, Brake was the Secretary of the All-Party Group for World Government, Treasurer of the All-Party Human Rights group, a member of the Franco British Parliamentary Relations group.

Between 2014 and 2015, Brake was an Assistant Whip for HM&#x27;s Treasury. In January 2015, Brake was appointed to the Liberal Democrat General Election Cabinet as the party&#x27;s Leader of the House of Commons and London spokesperson.

On 29 July 2015, Brake was named as foreign affairs spokesperson and party chief whip.

In June 2017, Brake was appointed as a Liberal Democrat spokesperson for international trade and European affairs.

In an interview with British-American centrist Owen Prell, who was visiting on behalf of Unite America, in Brake&#x27;s Westminster office in June 2017, Brake greatly attributed the inability of his party to perform better in House of Commons elections to first-past-the-post.

Brake lost his seat in the 2019 general election to Elliot Colburn of the Conservative Party.

===Subsequent career===
In October 2020, Brake was appointed as the new director of Unlock Democracy, an organisation which campaigns for a more participatory democracy in Britain, founded upon a written constitution. He has said that new rules should be introduced to require MPs to publish employment agreements linked to their political activities, and meanwhile should make the information available on a voluntary basis.

He is an honorary associate of the National Secular Society.

<doc id="414689" wikidata="Q264827" url="?curid=414689" title="Julian Brazier">
<text>Sir Julian William Hendy Brazier (born 24 July 1953) is a British Conservative Party politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Canterbury from 1987 to 2017. Since 2019, he has served as the President of Catholics in the Conservative Party.

==Early life and career==
Born into a military family, his father being a lieutenant colonel, Brazier was educated at two independent schools: the Dragon School in Oxford and Wellington College in the village of Crowthorne in Berkshire. He then went to Brasenose College, Oxford, graduating with a BA in mathematics and philosophy, later promoted to an Oxford MA. He was the President of the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1973.

Brazier joined the Territorial Army aged 19 in 1972 and served for 13 years, five of which were with 21 SAS(R). He was awarded the Efficiency Decoration in 1993. He was employed by Charter Consolidated Ltd between 1975 and 1984, being involved in economic research from 1975 to 1977 and corporate finance from 1977 to 1981, and was on the executive committee of the board from 1981 to 1984, when he became a management consultant with HB Maynard International, now owned by Accenture.

Brazier contested the 1983 general election in Berwick-upon-Tweed, but was defeated by the Liberal MP Alan Beith by 8,215 votes. He contested the Conservative safe seat of Canterbury at the 1987 general election following the retirement of the sitting MP, David Crouch. He held the seat with a majority of 14,891.

==Parliamentary career==

Brazier became the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Gillian Shephard, the Minister of State at the Treasury. He remained Shephard&#x27;s PPS following the 1992 general election in her new capacity as the Secretary of State for Employment, but he resigned in 1993 as a protest against defence cuts. He was awarded the &#x27;Backbencher of the Year&#x27; at the annual &quot;Spectator&quot; magazine awards in 1996. Following the 1997 general election, he became a member of the Defence Select committee.

Beginning in 1998, Brazier led a campaign opposing the closure of Kent and Canterbury Hospital and in support of its Cancer Centre. This included multiple adjournment debates in the Commons, questions to the minister, and taking part in public demonstrations. The initial plans for shutdown were overturned in 2005, but he continued to campaign in 2017.

Following the 2001 general election that Brazier was given a job by Iain Duncan Smith, then Leader of the Opposition, initially as an Opposition Whip in 2001, then as a spokesman on Work and Pensions in 2002.

He was briefly Home Affairs spokesman in 2003, before being moved later in the year by Michael Howard, who had succeeded Duncan Smith, to be a spokesman on International Affairs. Brazier remained on the frontbench after the 2005 general election as a spokesman on Transport (Shipping &amp; Aviation).

Brazier was a member of the Cornerstone Group of Conservative MPs. This group is considered to be on the right of the Conservative Party, and away from the more centrist direction of the leadership. As a practising Roman Catholic, he is a social conservative. Brazier supported a bill put forth by Laurence Robertson in June 2005 that would have put heavy restraints on abortion.

In 2008, he proposed a law that would allow parliament to ban seriously violent films and games, even if the BBFC had approved them.

During the run up to the 2016 EU membership referendum, Julian Brazier was in favour of leaving the EU.

Towards the end of the Lebanese Civil War, Brazier visited Beirut and Lebanese president Michel Aoun, while the city was besieged by Syrian occupation forces. In 1996 he returned, organising the British delegation to an Anglo-Lebanese conference on Freedom and Democracy held in defiance of the Syrian-backed regime but attended by the UK and US ambassadors. He later returned in 2006 as UK representative at an international protest against the treatment of Lebanese lawyer, Dr Muhamad Mugraby, who had exposed the arrest and illegal detentions during the Syrian-dominated era.

Brazier consistently voted against bills furthering LGBT rights, including equaling the age of consent, civil partnerships and scrapping the controversial Section 28 act, which banned teachers from &quot;promoting homosexuality&quot; or &quot;teaching ... the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship&quot;. He opposed the legalisation of same-sex marriage, saying that it would &quot;undermine a treasured institution and could have unforeseen consequences&quot;. Brazier was also quoted as saying, &quot;We shouldn’t allow an institution of this importance to be re-defined simply to meet a rights agenda&quot;.

Because of his earlier career, Brazier has a special interest in the armed forces and was an advocate of military issues in the House of Commons. He was also a member of the Public Bill Committee for the Defence Reform Act 2014. In 2010, Brazier was appointed by Prime Minister David Cameron as a member of a three person commission to plan the future of Britain&#x27;s reserve armed forces. This reported in July 2011, providing a blueprint which was subsequent largely adopted by the government in its 2013 white paper. In May 2014, he was one of eight candidates for the chairmanship of the House of Commons Defence Select Committee. Although unsuccessful, he came third on the first round, and was eliminated after six rounds of voting. He served as a member of the committee from 2010 to 2014, when he was appointed Minister for Reserves at the Ministry of Defence.

As co-chairman of the All Party Group for Adventure and Recreation in Society, Brazier campaigned against the impact of so-called compensation culture and excessive health and safety legislation on adventure opportunities for young people. For this, he was shortlisted for the Grassroot Diplomat Initiative Award in 2015, and he remains in the directory of the Grassroot Diplomat Who&#x27;s Who publication.

Brazier was knighted in the 2017 New Year Honours. At the general election 2017, he narrowly lost his seat to Labour&#x27;s Rosie Duffield.

== Subsequent career ==
Following his defeat in the 2017 general election, Brazier became non-executive chairman of a &#x27;counter-terrorism&#x27; security company, and non-executive director of a virtual reality startup, as well as a member of the Council of the Air League. He remains a trustee of the Summer Camps Trust.

He was Honorary Colonel of the Land Information Assurance Group Army Reserve until August 2023, when his commission with the Land Forces also expired.

==Personal life==
Brazier married Katharine Elizabeth Blagden on 21 July 1984 in Hampshire. The couple have three sons (twins born July 1990, and another son born December 1992). His youngest son, John, was elected councillor for Westgate ward at the 2015 Canterbury City Council election, and resigned in 2017. He is the son-in-law of Brigadier Paddy Blagden, a United Nations de-mining expert.

In February 2002, Brazier was given a four-month suspended sentence after he crashed into and killed a motorcyclist in Italy on 29 August 2001. Brazier had been driving on the wrong side of the road approaching a sharp bend when he hit a motorcyclist, 42-year-old Carlo Civitelli, near Siena. He used his TA training to give Civitelli first aid at the scene, but the man died three days later. Italian police found that Mr Civitelli&#x27;s helmet was not properly fitted and that he was probably speeding. After the verdict, Brazier said in a statement: &quot;I am still deeply saddened by the tragic consequences of my lapse of attention. My thoughts are with the Civitelli family whose reaction to the whole terrible business has been so generous&quot;. He also said &quot;as a parent, I shall carry the memory of this man&#x27;s death with me for the rest of my life.&quot;

<doc id="414694" wikidata="Q206852" url="?curid=414694" title="Light Years (Kylie Minogue album)">
<text>Light Years is the seventh studio album by Australian singer Kylie Minogue. Mushroom Records released it on 22 September 2000 in Australia; Parlophone released it on 25 September 2000 in the United Kingdom. Following the commercial failure of &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; (1997), Minogue left Deconstruction Records and took a hiatus from recording music. She signed with Parlophone in June 1999 and decided to return to her pop roots. She worked with various writers and producers, including Steve Anderson, Johnny Douglas, Robbie Williams, Guy Chambers, and Mark Picchiotti.

&quot;Light Years&quot; is a dance-pop, disco, and Europop album that refers to music from the 1970s. Lyrically, the album touches upon themes of women&#x27;s empowerment, celebration, and sex, in a cheeky and campy approach. Music critics provided positive reviews, complimenting Minogue&#x27;s return to pop despite them being ambivalent towards the lyrical content. Retrospectively, &quot;Light Years&quot; has been recognised as one of Minogue&#x27;s strongest releases. The album won the ARIA Award for Best Female Artist and Best Pop Release at the 2001 ceremonies. &quot;Light Years&quot; peaked in the top position on the Australian Albums Chart, Minogue&#x27;s first number-one album in her native Australia. It reached the top 10 in Russia, Scotland, New Zealand, and on the UK Albums Chart.

Five singles were released from &quot;Light Years&quot;, including &quot;Spinning Around&quot; and &quot;On a Night Like This&quot;, which both reached number one in Australia, as well as the top 20 entries &quot;Kids&quot; and &quot;Please Stay&quot;. All peaked inside the top 10 in the UK. The final single, &quot;Your Disco Needs You&quot; was only released in Australia and Germany. &quot;Light Years&quot; was further promoted with the On a Night Like This Tour, which visited Europe and Australia from March to May 2001. At the time, it was the highest grossing tour by a solo artist in Australia, with ticket sales of approximately US$5 million. The album was re-issued in Europe in 2018 and returned to the UK Albums Chart and the Scottish Albums Chart.

==Background==
In 1997, Kylie Minogue released her sixth studio album, &quot;Impossible Princess&quot;. The album represented a drastic change in the singer&#x27;s musical direction, incorporating elements of electronica and alternative music. The British public was unimpressed with her new musical direction, viewing it as a trend-chasing attempt, and failed to identify with her new intimate image as &quot;IndieKylie&quot;. The backlash resulted in &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; having little impact on British record charts—it initially peaked at number 10 on the UK Albums Chart and sold only 18,000 copies in the first two weeks of release. After embarking on a successful promotional tour, Minogue left Deconstruction Records and BMG in November 1998, ending their six-year relationship.

Following the split, Minogue took a break from recording music to focus on her acting career. She spent several months in Barbados performing Miranda in Toby Gough&#x27;s production of &quot;The Tempest&quot; during an annual operatic festival. She also starred in the Australian films &quot;Cut&quot; and &quot;Sample People&quot;, both released in 2000. She gave several live performances in Australia, including the 1998 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, the opening ceremonies of Melbourne&#x27;s Crown Casino and Sydney&#x27;s Fox Studios in 1999. Minogue performed Duran Duran&#x27;s 1984 single &quot;The Reflex&quot; on the tribute complication &quot;Undone: The Songs of Duran Duran&quot; (1999), and collaborated with the Pet Shop Boys on a duet, titled &quot;In Denial&quot;, on their 1999 studio album &quot;Nightlife&quot;.

Following &quot;In Denial&quot;, Parlophone—a British record label the Pet Shop Boys had been with since 1985—decided to sign Minogue in June 1999. She announced she would start working on a new album, saying: &quot;I took my time in choosing a new label [...] there is much I hope to achieve with my next album and I believe that anything is possible with this new partnership.&quot; Parlophone A&amp;R executive Miles Leonard commented: &quot;I believed that [Minogue] was still very strong vocally, and still definitely a star... I believed in her as an artist and I knew that with the right project, the right songwriters, the right producers, the right team, she would still have a fanbase out there.&quot;

==Development and recording==

In an early meeting with Parlophone to discuss which direction Minogue intended to pursue, the singer decided to return to her pop roots, saying &quot;I should do what I do best... [Pop music] is the kind of music that people want from me.&quot; Minogue believed the album was a new beginning, as she started singing pop music again. Minogue was inspired by the music of the 1970s, which she discovered when she was a child via her parents&#x27; record collection, including the soundtrack from &quot;Grease&quot; (1978), Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;Bad Girls&quot; and &quot;Dim All the Lights&quot; (both in 1979). The label did not want to make another Pete Waterman Limited (PWL) record, but quality pop music with the help of great contributions and collaborations. Her team approached PWL owner Pete Waterman, who had worked with Minogue earlier in her career, during the production. However, the collaboration did not happen.

Minogue enjoyed making &quot;Light Years&quot;; she got a chance to work with people who were certain how they wanted her to sound. She felt that working with different producers would help the album have a diverse feeling. She wanted the album to be song-driven and explained the musical styles to the producers with three keywords: &quot;poolside&quot;, &quot;disco&quot;, and &quot;cocktails&quot;. Minogue worked on &quot;Light Years&quot; in Sydney, London, and Los Angeles, where she put the final touches on the album. Before signing with Parlophone, Minogue spent a week with her frequent collaborator Steve Anderson at Real World Studios in Box, Wiltshire, where most of the production of &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; was done. Three tracks were chosen from the session: &quot;So Now Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Butterfly&quot;, and &quot;Bittersweet Goodbye&quot;. Minogue picked &quot;Bittersweet Goodbye&quot; when she was deep in the production process, saying it made her feel calm. A string arrangement by Wil Malone was added to the track, while Anderson kept Minogue&#x27;s vocals from the original demo. Chicago-based DJ Mark Picchiotti flew to Los Angeles to record Minogue&#x27;s vocals for &quot;Butterfly&quot;, and then produced the track in his hometown.

Former Take That member Robbie Williams contributed three songs with his songwriting partner Guy Chambers: &quot;Loveboat&quot;, &quot;Your Disco Needs You&quot;, and &quot;Kids&quot;. Minogue shared the songwriting credit on the first two. She found in Williams her ideal male counterpart based on their similar musical output; she felt the work between Williams and Chamber was extraordinary. Chamber co-wrote another track with Minogue titled &quot;I&#x27;m So High&quot;. They were among the earliest collaborations, which Minogue felt were a good foundation for the album. Minogue wrote the lyrics to &quot;Light Years&quot; with Biffco&#x27;s songwriters Richard Stannard and Julian Gallagher in 10 minutes. The demo, originally titled &quot;Light Relief&quot;, was unexpectedly favoured by the label and was picked up for the final tracklist. The songwriters also collaborated on &quot;Please Stay&quot;.

Minogue made several demos with a set of writers and producers arranged by Brian Rawling, including Steve Torch, Graham Stack, and Mark Taylor. She ended up recording &quot;On a Night Like This&quot;, a song written originally for the Swedish recording artist Pandora for her 1999 album &quot;No Regrets&quot;. In New York, A&amp;R executive Jamie Nelson pitched a demo of &quot;Spinning Around&quot; to Minogue and she agreed to record it. The track—written by Ira Shickman, Osborne Bingham, Kara DioGuardi, and Paula Abdul—was originally intended to be featured on Abdul&#x27;s studio album, but it was given to Minogue after the album failed to materialise. Minogue recorded &quot;Under the Influence of Love&quot;, a song written by Paul Politi and Barry White that Love Unlimited covered in 1974. The track reminded Minogue of her previous songs, despite having not heard it before the production of &quot;Light Years&quot;. Johnny Douglas wrote and produced &quot;Password&quot;, &quot;Disco Down&quot;, and &quot;Koocachoo&quot;; he also produced &quot;So Now Goodbye&quot;, a track that Minogue wrote with Anderson.

==Musical styles==
Music critics have characterised &quot;Light Years&quot; as a dance-pop, disco, and Europop album. The album marked a return to her signature pop style, following the experimental record &quot;Impossible Princess&quot;. A reviewer from &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; and Nick Levine of Digital Spy emphasise elements of disco, the 1970s and early 2000s music. AllMusic&#x27;s Chris True noted the album reflects the late 1990s teen pop movement. Yahoo! Music&#x27;s Gary Crossing referred to the album as a &quot;largely undemanding collection of disco, Hi-NRG, Ibizan trance, funk, 60s film and TV themes and Latin-flavoured tunes&quot;. Elements of house, electronica, psychedelic pop, Eurodisco, and French Touch were highlighted by Nick Smith of &quot;musicOMH&quot; and Ian Gormely of &quot;Exclaim!&quot;. Described the album as being filled with &quot;crisp rhythm sections, melodic orchestral passages and vivid grooves&quot;, &quot;Albumism&quot;″s Quentin Harrison also noted influences from 1970s artists Cheryl Lynn, Tina Charles, and The Hues Corporation.
The opening track, &quot;Spinning Around&quot;, is a string-laden dance-pop song with prominent influences from disco music. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Betty Clarke opined that the track sets the tone for &quot;Light Years&quot; and compared it to Minogue&#x27;s &quot;Hand on Your Heart&quot; (1989). &quot;So Now Goodbye&quot;—a track that blends house, disco, and electronica elements—draws inspiration from Gloria Gaynor&#x27;s &quot;I Will Survive&quot; (1978), Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Lucky Star&quot; (1983) and the work of American band Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. The bittersweet &quot;Disco Down&quot; was compared to the work of Giorgio Moroder and featured Christmassy church bells during the chorus. Michael Dwyer of &quot;The Age&quot; found Minogue goes &quot;hardcore Mardi Gras&quot; on the contemporary house and electronic dance track &quot;Butterfly&quot;. &quot;On a Night Like This&quot; has a darker, more Europop edge, which was compared to Spiller&#x27;s &quot;Groovejet (If This Ain&#x27;t Love)&quot; (2000).

Backing vocals and the arrangement of strings and fluttering flutes drive the fifth track, &quot;Loveboat&quot;. The song features funky light guitar and faux-French effects. &quot;Loveboat&quot; was compared to the work of Barry Manilow, Minogue&#x27;s &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need Anyone&quot; (1997), and Williams&#x27;s &quot;Millennium&quot; (1998). &quot;Koocachoo&quot; has elements of jazz and the 1960s music, and built around a chirping synth and horn arrangement. The track contains a groovy bass riff, retro guitar tone, sitar, keyboard sound effects, and &quot;ba baba ba&quot; harmonies in the chorus. English bassist Paul Turner contributed bass and guitars to the track. &quot;Your Disco Needs You&quot; is a disco track that is heavily influenced by Village People&#x27;s &quot;Go West&quot; (1979). Minogue sings in a serious tone, accompanied by a brass section, regal horns, a male chorus, and high soprano back-up vocals. Cameron Adams from the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; felt that the song is a hybrid between Village People&#x27;s &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; (1978) and Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; (1975), while Chris Charles of the BBC News described it as &quot;ABBA and the Pet Shop Boys getting down at the hottest gay club in town&quot;.

The samba-infused &quot;Password&quot; was used as a pregap hidden introductory track. &quot;Please Stay&quot; features Latin pop, soft acoustic, and flamenco elements. Crossing found &quot;Bittersweet Goodbye&quot;, the album&#x27;s only sentimental ballad, to be a &quot;strange concoction&quot; of Olivia Newton-John, Kate Bush and Cocteau Twins. It is followed by Minogue&#x27;s cover of &quot;Under the Influence of Love&quot; (1967), in which her vocals are double-tracked for the bridge. Smith referred to the track as &quot;Saint Etienne meets the best of the Nolans&quot;. The guitar-driven pop track &quot;I&#x27;m So High&quot; contains a subtle and slowly building melody. Dwyer wrote songs like &quot;I&#x27;m So High&quot; help Minogue &quot;leave the club floor for car radio with equally enjoyable results&quot;. The penultimate track is &quot;Kids&quot;, a joyous pop duet with Williams. It has funky groove rhythms and a distorted, guitar-driven euphoric chorus with soft guitars, synths, and vocal crescendos. English musicians Chris Sharrock and Neil Taylor played percussion and guitars on &quot;Kids&quot;, respectively. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; Emma Pearse felt that the song helps Minogue transport her energy &quot;into Prince and Beck territory&quot;. The post-disco title track is an homage to Summer&#x27;s &quot;I Feel Love&quot; (1977), featuring harmonies and electronic touches. The track reminds Clarke of Brotherhood of Man&#x27;s &quot;Angelo&quot; (1977).

==Themes==
Minogue called &quot;Light Years&quot; an uplifting and vibrant record, with mostly happy songs that reflect her easy nature when she was making the album. She said listening to it felt like being on a summer holiday. Lyrically, Minogue said that she was &quot;really going for it... [without] holding back&quot;, with several songs containing cheekiness, showgirl images, or camp elements. The songs were written from her imagination, rather than the autobiographical style of songwriting that she had experimented with on her previous record &quot;Impossible Princess&quot;. Minogue recalled writing each song as if it was a scene from a film or a video and trying to interpret and convert the idea into a song. Harrison highlighted Minogue&#x27;s ability to focus on themes of flirtation, fun, and romance &quot;without undercutting her previous growth as an artist&quot; on &quot;Impossible Princess&quot;.
Betty Clarke of &quot;The Guardian&quot; identified the theme of women&#x27;s empowerment and celebration. She called &quot;Light Years&quot; &quot;an album that celebrates being a girl&quot;, and commented that &quot;not since the Spice Girls has the capacity to fill a dress been so celebrated&quot;. &quot;Spinning Around&quot; declares Minogue has changed and learned from her past mistakes. True and Smith interpreted it as Minogue&#x27;s move away from her more experimental work on &quot;Impossible Princess&quot;. Pam Avoledo of &quot;Blogcritics&quot; found the amorous song depicted a woman who is expressing herself and taking control of her life. Clarke viewed &quot;On a Night Like This&quot; and &quot;So Now Goodbye&quot; as the up-tempo disco antics that successfully depict the notions of &quot;grabbing the best looking man in the club, then ditching him when you feel like it&quot;. &quot;Butterfly&quot; discusses the spiritual freedom and joy of life, while &quot;Bittersweet Goodbye&quot; is a stripped-back ode to love. Smith viewed the track as a tribute to her former lover Michael Hutchence, who died in November 1997.

Writing for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, Catherine Keenan wrote the album is &quot;full of gay club anthems and not short on sex&quot;. Minogue calls for the listener to join her on the dance floor on &quot;Your Disco Needs You&quot;. At one point, she delivers a military-like spoken interlude in French: &quot;Vous êtes jamais seuls / Vous savez ce qu&#x27;il faut faire / Ne laissez pas tomber votre nation / La disco a besoin de vous!&quot; (&quot;You are never alone / You know what to do / Don&#x27;t let your nation down / The disco needs you!&quot;) &quot;Loveboat&quot; is an homage to the 1970s television series of the same name, while referencing martinis, bikinis and James Bond in its lyrics. It contains several French phrases and cheeky lines such as &quot;Rub on some lotion / The places I can&#x27;t reach.&quot; Levine referred to the lyrics of &quot;Loveboat&quot; as a sensual couplet. Smith felt that the track is a mixture of kitsch and tropicana, and Minogue sounds ebullient. The penultimate track is &quot;Kids&quot;, a joyous pop duet with Williams. The track references to the careers of both Minogue and Williams, with Minogue singing the line: &quot;I&#x27;ve been dropping beats since &quot;Back in Black&quot;.&quot; On the title track, Minogue plays an air hostess on a fictional KM-Air flight. Adams found Minogue devoted to the erotic track.

==Packaging and release==
German fashion photographer Vincent Peters shot the artwork for &quot;Light Years&quot;, while Mark Farrow was selected to design the cover. The shoot took place in Ibiza, a place that Minogue felt &quot;has a magical quality&quot; to it. On the cover, wearing a blue chiffon swimsuit, Minogue stares into the distance. The cover has a backdrop of the sky and the sea, with a glimpse of a golden sunset filtering through. Parlophone dropped Minogue&#x27;s surname on the cover, and branded it as a &quot;Kylie&quot; album. Minogue wanted the cover to capture the music&#x27;s essence: sunshine, beach, fun, and glamour. She thought the photoshoot was extraordinary, and the &quot;lightness of the chiffon matched [her] mood and desire&quot;. Another picture from the photoshoot saw a head-to-knees Minogue wearing nothing but a towel. Peters felt Minogue has a strong sense of self, which sets her apart from other celebrities he had worked with. William Baker, who helped through the album process, said that he wanted a cover that was &quot;a visual statement about [Minogue] reclaiming the throne of the Princess of Pop&quot; and the result shows she has &quot;returned to her rightful place!&quot;
Crossing found the glossy sleeve artwork &quot;leaves very little to the imagination&quot; and that Minogue is &quot;unashamedly playing [her] &#x27;never mind the book, have a gander at the cover&#x27; card&quot;. Clarke wrote &quot;Light Years&quot; was packaged &quot;with male hormones in mind&quot;. Charles found it tacky, while John Earls of &quot;Classic Pop&quot; noted its commercialized nature, commenting that the artwork is better suited for a Ministry of Sound compilation and the cover is the only dull aspect of &quot;Light Years&quot;. From the same publication, Christian Guiltenane wrote Minogue created &quot;a stunning fantasy figure&quot; with the sunset&#x27;s glow behind her. Writing for &quot;Idolator&quot;, Mike Wass commented that the &quot;camp, fun and flirty&quot; cover successfully captured the music of &quot;Light Years&quot;.

Minogue titled the album &quot;Light Years&quot; describing her career journey, which she believes will continue as she has just begun to discover herself. She said: &quot;I feel like I&#x27;ve come a long way... I think some other forces know where I&#x27;m going, but I&#x27;m not meant to know–that would&#x27;ve ruined it.&quot; Clarke felt the title was Minogue&#x27;s response to &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, a similarly named 1998 album by Madonna. The album includes &quot;Password&quot;, a hidden introductory track in the pregap portion of the CD. The listener can only hear the track by rewinding the opening song &quot;Spinning Around&quot;. Robbie Williams, who usually has hidden tracks at the end of his albums, inspired this. Minogue said that although she was making a grown-up album, she wanted to keep a sense of enjoyment. She admitted the method is &quot;a bit odd and silly, but that&#x27;s the fun of it&quot;. Smith felt the track was hard to find, while Earls commented the decision was made at &quot;the peak of the CD boom&quot; and &quot;Password&quot; is a worthy reward.

Mushroom Records first released the album in Australia on 22 September 2000. Parlophone released it on 25 September 2000 in the UK. On the German, Spanish and Japanese versions of the album, the original French spoken interlude of &quot;Your Disco Needs You&quot; was translated into their respective languages. EMI released the album in Canada on 26 September 2000 and distributed the album in North America. A special tour edition package was released in the UK on 5 March 2001, containing a second disc featuring various remixes. For the Australian tour edition, additional remixes were included as well as Minogue&#x27;s cover of Olivia Newton-John&#x27;s &quot;Physical&quot; (1981), which she performed during the tour. The album was re-issued by Parlophone in Japan in 2003, 2007, 2009, and 2011. In 2018, &quot;Light Years&quot; was re-released by BMG as a blue vinyl exclusively through Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket chain in Europe, limited to 2500 copies.

==Promotion==
===Live performances and tour===
Shortly after signing with Parlophone, Minogue and Baker released an elaborate art book titled &quot;Kylie&quot;. The photography-only book celebrates fan memorabilia, commentary, and Minogue&#x27;s life. The book contains a nude sketch of Minogue, and several celebrities such as Elle MacPherson, fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, actor Barry Humphries, and singer Boy George. Minogue appeared on the controversial cover of the June issue of &quot;GQ&quot; shot by Terry Richardson, wearing a white tennis dress showing her naked bottom with the banner &quot;Kylie: At Your Service&quot;.

Minogue did an extensive promotion campaign for the album, appearing on various television programs and at music festivals. On 17 June 2000, before the album&#x27;s release, Minogue appeared specially at London&#x27;s G-A-Y nightclub where she performed several songs, including &quot;Spinning Around&quot;, &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot; and &quot;Step Back in Time&quot;. In July, she performed at Party in the Park in Hyde Park and Mardi Gras London in Finsbury Park. Wearing a pink showgirl costume, she performed ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; (1976) and &quot;On a Night Like This&quot; to an audience of 100,000 people at the 2000 Sydney Olympics closing ceremony in October. Later that month, she sang &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;, &quot;Celebration&quot; (1992), and &quot;Spinning Around&quot; at the 2000 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony.

Minogue promoted the album with her sixth concert tour, On a Night Like This. She performed in Europe in March 2001, before visiting Australia in April and May. Broadway shows and the musicals of the 1930s inspired the tour&#x27;s style. In the United Kingdom, the tour sold 140,000 tickets in one weekend. In Australia, Minogue played a record-breaking nine concerts at the Sydney Entertainment Centre, beating the previous record held by AC/DC for the most dates performed at the venue in a single tour. It was the biggest tour by a solo artist in the country, grossing U.S. $5 million from sales of 200,000 tickets. Minogue&#x27;s concert on 11 May 2001 was filmed and released on home video under the title &quot;Live in Sydney&quot;.

===Singles===
&quot;Spinning Around&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;Light Years&quot; in June 2000. Two previously unreleased tracks, the alternative dance &quot;Cover Me With Kisses&quot; and acoustic track &quot;Paper Dolls&quot;, were included on the single&#x27;s B-side. Liz Collins shot the single&#x27;s artwork, which captured Minogue dressed in pastel pink clutching a hula hoop. Directed by Dawn Shadforth, the music video features Minogue in revealing gold hotpants. The song entered the Australian Singles Chart at number one, becoming the singer&#x27;s first chart-topper since &quot;Confide in Me&quot; (1994). The song debuted at number one in the United Kingdom, making her only the second artist to have a number-one single in three consecutive decades (after Madonna). It was her fifth number-one single in the UK and her first in a decade, following &quot;Tears on My Pillow&quot; (1990).

The second single, &quot;On a Night Like This&quot;, was released in September, with the ballad &quot;Ocean Blue&quot; as the B-side track. It debuted at number one in Australia, making it her sixth number-one in that region; it also gave her the record for having the most singles debuting at number one with five entries. On the UK Singles Chart, the single debuted at number two. An accompanying music video, directed by Douglas Avery, was filmed in Monte Carlo in July. The plot is loosely based on Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1995 crime drama movie &quot;Casino&quot;, with Minogue portraying a trophy wife; Dutch actor Rutger Hauer served as her on-screen husband. An accompanying cover sleeve was taken from the booklet of &quot;Light Years&quot;, featuring Minogue lying on a marble surface before a sea front.

&quot;Kids&quot; was released as the third single from &quot;Light Years&quot; and as the second from Williams&#x27; album &quot;Sing When You&#x27;re Winning&quot; in October. Four original tracks by Williams appeared as B-side tracks: &quot;John&#x27;s Gay&quot;, &quot;Often&quot;, &quot;Karaoke Star&quot;, and &quot;Kill Me or Cure Me&quot;. The music video, directed by Simon Hilton, contains choreography taken from &quot;Grease&quot; and references to Busby Berkley. The single peaked at number fourteen in Australia and at number two in the United Kingdom. Released on December, the fourth single &quot;Please Stay&quot; peaked at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart, her 20th top 10 entry, and number 15 on the Australian Singles Chart. It was the final release from &quot;Light Years&quot; in the UK, and was backed by two B-side tracks: a cover of &quot;Santa Baby&quot; and the previously unreleased track &quot;Good Life&quot;. The music video saw Minogue sliding down a fireman&#x27;s pole and dancing on top of a pool table.

&quot;Your Disco Needs You&quot; was chosen as the final single, released only in Australia and Germany. It includes specially commissioned mixes of the track and &quot;Password&quot;. Hugely popular as an album track, it was never released as a single in the UK because the content was considered &quot;too gay&quot; and &quot;too camp&quot;. The decision sparked protests and petitions from fans lobbying for its release. A music video featuring scenes of Minogue dancing in formation accompanied the single&#x27;s release in Germany. The track peaked at number 20 in Australia and number 31 in Germany. &quot;Butterfly&quot;, a track that was in the running to be the fourth single, was remixed and issued in the US as a promotional single by Mark Picchiotti&#x27;s Blueplate Records in November 2001. It peaked at number fourteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Light Years&quot; received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. &quot;The Guardian&quot; assigned a normalized rating out of 10 to reviews from UK mainstream critics—the album has an average score of 5.8 based on 6 reviews. &quot;NME&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;Light Years&quot; is all you need to know about Kylie in less than an hour: fun, perfectly-formed, not too taxing and occasionally annoying&quot;. Dorian Lynskey of &quot;Select&quot; called it &quot;an unrelenting hoot&quot; that is filled with potential singles and fearlessly derivative. Clarke praised Minogue&#x27;s newfound confidence, noting she has &quot;her tongue firmly in her cheek for this camp slice of epic disco&quot;. Dwyer praised the &quot;breezy disco hedonism&quot; nature of &quot;Light Years&quot;, while Pearse wrote the album is among &quot;some decidedly classy classic pop creations&quot;.

Several reviewers were displeased with the album&#x27;s non-substantive production. Andrew Lynch of &quot;entertainment.ie&quot; viewed the album as inconsequential and uneven, although he considered it &quot;a much better record [as a whole] than most critics would like to admit&quot;. Crossing found the album well-produced, but was critical of the songwriting effort and its cheeky content. Charles thought that Minogue &quot;has become a parody of herself&quot; with an album filled with catchy, throwaway pop songs. Bernard Zuel of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; wrote Williams and Chambers&#x27; contributions keep &quot;Light Years&quot; from being completely disposable. In their negative reviews, T&#x27;Cha Dunlevy of &quot;The Gazette&quot; and Sandra Sperounes of &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; dismissed the record as lightweight and unimaginative, and said that Minogue &quot;is still doing her best Madonna&#x27;s impression.&quot;

Retrospectively, &quot;Light Years&quot; is generally considered to be one of Minogue&#x27;s strongest releases. It was one of three of Minogue&#x27;s studio albums to receive a four-star rating from British writer Colin Larkin in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; (2011) with &quot;Rhythm of Love&quot; (1990) and &quot;Fever&quot; (2001). He classified it as &quot;high standard&quot;. Smith praised Minogue&#x27;s confidence, calling the album a game-changer and her most accessible work since &quot;Rhythm of Love&quot;. Levine commented that &quot;as far as fruity little party records go, &quot;Light Years&quot; is an absolute peach&quot;. In 2018, Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; ranked &quot;Light Years&quot; as Minogue fourth-best studio album for its outstanding production. Harrison praised Minogue&#x27;s spirited vocal performance, and concluded that besides its carefree appeal, &quot;Light Years&quot; has an &quot;unrecognized compositional breadth and vitality that affirms Minogue&#x27;s ongoing commitment to music excellence&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
Upon its release, &quot;Light Years&quot; debuted in second position on the ARIA Charts the week of 8 October 2000, denied the top position by &quot;The Games of the XXVII Olympiad: Official Music from the Opening Ceremony&quot;, the official album of the 2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. In its third charting week, it rose to number one, becoming Minogue&#x27;s first number-one album in her home country, 12 years after her debut album was released. The album remained within the top 20 for over 30 consecutive weeks, from October 2000 to June 2001. It fell off the chart for the first time in July 2001, before re-entering at number 40 in October when &quot;Fever&quot; was released. In total, &quot;Light Years&quot; spent 43 weeks on the top 50 chart, beating &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; as Minogue&#x27;s longest-charting album at the time. Within the year 2000, the album was certified quadruple platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for sales exceeding 280,000 copies. It appeared on the ARIA year-end album charts for 2000 and 2001 at number seventeen on both, and the decade-end chart at number 69. In New Zealand, the album debuted and peaked at number eight the week of 22 October; &quot;Light Years&quot; marked Minogue&#x27;s highest-charting album in New Zealand since &quot;Enjoy Yourself&quot; peaked at number six in 1989.

The album debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart during the week of 7 October 2000, behind Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Music&quot;. On 9 February 2001, it was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments of more than 300,000 units. It was Minogue&#x27;s most successful album sales-wise since &quot;Enjoy Yourself&quot; in 1989. When &quot;Fever&quot; was released in October 2001, &quot;Light Years&quot; had remained in the top 100 for 27 non-consecutive weeks. From January to May 2002, the album re-entered the chart, staying for 11 weeks. In 2018, the reissue of &quot;Light Years&quot; peaked at number 36 on the UK Albums Chart on 7 June; it was the third best-selling vinyl album of the week. That same week, the reissue also appeared on the Scottish Albums Chart, reaching number 21—&quot;Light Years&quot; had previously peaked at number 3 there after its original release in 2000. In Ireland, the album spent five weeks on the chart and peaked at number 13. &quot;Light Years&quot; had sold 508,739 copies in the UK as of September 2023, and in total the album spent a total of 39 non-consecutive weeks on the Official Albums Chart.

According to &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot;, &quot;Light Years&quot; peaked at number 10 on the European Top 100 Albums chart. The album peaked within the top 40 in several European countries, including Belgium, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland. &quot;Light Years&quot; also reached number 50 in France, and number 71 in Netherlands. In South Africa, the album peaked at number 11 and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry of South Africa for shipments of 100,000 copies.

==Accolades and impact==
&quot;Spinning Around&quot; earned nominations for Best Female Artist and Best Pop Release at the 2000 ARIA Music Awards show, winning the latter. In the following ceremony, &quot;Light Years&quot; garnered four nominations, winning Minogue&#x27;s first Best Female Artist and the second-consecutive Best Pop Release, while losing both Highest Selling Album and Album of the Year to Powderfinger&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey Number Five&quot; (2000). That same year, &quot;On a Night Like This&quot; was also nominated for Highest Selling Single and Single of the Year. Phonographic Performance Company of Australia recognised Minogue as the seventh-most broadcast artist of 2001, while three tracks from &quot;Light Years&quot; appeared on the top 100 Most Broadcast Recordings of 2001: &quot;Spinning Around&quot; (number 12), &quot;On a Night Like This&quot; (number 15), and &quot;Kids&quot; (number 163).

Music critics recognised &quot;Light Years&quot; for reviving Minogue&#x27;s career and reestablishing her to the public. The music video for &quot;Spinning Around&quot; led to her bottom and the revealing hotpants gaining extensive coverage in the media, referring to it as one of her trademark looks. Jaelani Turner-Williams of &quot;Stereogum&quot; and Clarke credited the album for introducing a more sophisticated side of disco-pop for the new century. Minogue went on to make six more studio albums with Parlophone until 2016, her longest label residency after Mushroom Records.

Critics also highlighted &quot;Light Years&quot;″ impact on the music scene. Cinquemani stated house tracks &quot;On a Night Like This&quot; and &quot;Butterfly&quot; predicted the rise of EDM music and created the template for Minogue&#x27;s releases over the next 15 years. True commented Minogue is finally comfortable with who she is and praised the album as one of the best disco records since the 1970s. A reviewer from &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; credited the album for bringing nu-disco to the public, predicting the direction for her later releases, and influencing pop projects for two decades—namely Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Confessions on a Dance Floor&quot; (2005), Arcade Fire&#x27;s &quot;Reflektor&quot; (2013), and Carly Rae Jepsen&#x27;s &quot;Julien&quot; (2019). In a 2010 article, Karina Halle of &quot;Consequence&quot; noted Minogue&#x27;s flamboyant musical style has been passed down to contemporary pop artists like Lady Gaga.

<text>Peter T. Daniels (born December 11, 1951) is a scholar of writing systems, specializing in typology. He was co-editor (with William Bright) of the book &quot;The World&#x27;s Writing Systems&quot; (1996). He was a lecturer at University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee and Chicago State University.

He received degrees in linguistics from Cornell University and the University of Chicago.

Daniels introduced two neologisms for categories of scripts, first published in 1990: &quot;abjad&quot; (an &quot;alphabet&quot; with no vowel letters, derived from the Arabic term) and &quot;abugida&quot; (a system of consonant+vowel base syllables modified to denote other or no vowels, derived from the Ethiopic term per a suggestion from Wolf Leslau).

<text>Colin Edward Breed (4 May 1947 – 9 May 2024) was a British Liberal Democrat politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for South East Cornwall from 1997 until he stood down at the 2010 general election. He was also member of the parliamentary party&#x27;s Treasury team.

==Early life==
Breed was born in north-east Surrey on 4 May 1947, the son of a chef. He was educated at Torquay Boys&#x27; Grammar School. 

Breed was appointed an area manager with the Midland Bank in 1964. After 17 years with the bank, he became the managing director of Rowan Dartington &amp; Co Ltd in 1981, before becoming a director with Gemini Abrasives in 1992 until his election to Westminster.

==Political career==
Breed was elected as a councillor to both the Caradon District Council and to the Saltash Town Council in 1982. He was twice selected as the Mayor of Saltash. He was selected to contest the constituency of Cornwall South East at the 1997 general election, when the sitting Conservative MP Robert Hicks was retiring. The 1997 general election saw losses for the Conservatives across the UK and Breed was comfortably elected as the new Liberal Democrat MP for Cornwall South East with a majority of 6,480. He made his maiden speech on 24 June 1997 on the preservation of plant varieties.

In Parliament, Breed was appointed a Liberal Democrat spokesman on Trade and Industry by Paddy Ashdown in 1997. When Charles Kennedy was elected as the Leader of the Liberal Democrats in 1999, Breed was promoted to the Liberal Democrat Shadow Cabinet as the Shadow Agriculture minister. In the same year he became a member of the General Medical Council.

Breed was dropped from the Liberal Democrat Shadow Cabinet following the 2001 general election, but was appointed a spokesman on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, before moving to speak on Defence in 2002. He returned to be a spokesman on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs following the 2005 General Election.

Breed stood down from Parliament in April 2010, aged 62, and did not seek re-election. His seat was lost to the Conservative Sheryll Murray who won with a 9.1% swing.

==Personal life and death==
Breed was a Methodist lay preacher and voted conservatively on issues such as homosexuality. He married Janet Courtiour in 1968 in Torbay and they had a son and a daughter.

Breed died on 9 May 2024, at the age of 77.

<doc id="414707" wikidata="Q533444" url="?curid=414707" title="Meyer Schapiro">
<text>Meyer Schapiro (23 September 1904 – 3 March 1996) was a Lithuanian-born American art historian who developed new art historical methodologies that incorporated an interdisciplinary approach to the study of works. An expert on early Christian, Medieval and modern art, he explored periods and movements with an eye toward their works&#x27; social, political and material constructions.

Credited with fundamentally changing the course of the art historical discipline, Schapiro&#x27;s scholarly approach was dynamic and it engaged other scholars, philosophers and artists. An active professor, lecturer, student, writer and humanist, he maintained a long professional association with Columbia University in New York.

==Background==
Meir Schapiro was born in Šiauliai, Lithuania (then Governorate of Kaunas of the Russian Empire) on September 23, 1904. His ancestors were Talmudic scholars. His parents, Nathan Menachem Schapiro and Fanny Adelman Schapiro, were Lithuanian Jews.

In 1906, his father came to New York City and found a job as a Hebrew teacher at the Yitzcak Elchanan Yeshiva on the Lower East Side. Once secure, he sent for his family, who emigrated in 1907. The son&#x27;s first name changed from &quot;Meir&quot; to &quot;Meyer&quot;. He grew up in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, where he was first exposed to art in evening classes taught by John Sloan at the Hebrew Educational Society.

He attended Public School 84 and then Boys High School in Brooklyn. He attended lectures on anthropology and economics at the Young People&#x27;s Socialist League. During summers, he worked as a Western Union delivery boy, a warehouse packer, an electrical-supply assembler and an adjustment clerk at Macy&#x27;s.

==Education==
In 1920, Schapiro entered Columbia University as a 16-year-old Pulitzer and Regents scholar. His professors included Mark Van Doren and Franz Boas. Undergraduate classmates included Whittaker Chambers, Clifton Fadiman, Herbert Solow, Lionel Trilling, Henry Zolinsky and Louis Zukofsky, with many of whom he contributed to &quot;The Morningside&quot; literary magazine. In 1923, he traveled to Europe with Chambers and Zolinsky. During his undergraduate days, he became known for his &quot;Schapiric victory&quot;, by allegedly reducing an instructor to tears by means of dialectic logic. In 1924, he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree with honors in art history and philosophy. Princeton University denied him admission for his doctorate, so he continued at Columbia and earned his doctoral degree in art history in 1929. His professors at that time included Ernest DeWald. His dissertation, five years in the making, examined the cloister and portal of Moissac Abbey, built about A.D. 1100: Dr. Schapiro&#x27;s research went far beyond the implications of Moissac itself. Medieval church history, liturgy, theology, social history, illuminated manuscripts, folklore, epigraphy, the analysis of ornament and national characteristics (real or imagined) all were pressed into service and synthesized. As a result, what had been thought of as antiquarian artifacts were seen to have a completely different character. &quot;A new sphere of artistic creation,&quot; Dr. Schapiro called it, &quot;without religious content and imbued with values of spontaneity, individual fantasy, delight in color and movement, and the expression of feelings that anticipate modern art. This new art, on the margins of religious work, was accompanied by a conscious taste of the spectators for the beauty of workmanship, materials and artistic devices, apart from religious meanings.&quot;

(In 1975, he received his third degree from Columbia, an honorary doctor of letters.)

==Career==

===Academics===
Schapiro spent his entire working career at Columbia. In 1928, he began teaching as a lecturer, before completing his dissertation. In 1936, he became assistant professor. In 1946, he became associate professor. In 1952, he became a full professor. In 1965, he was named University Professor. He became University Professor Emeritus in 1973. His final, weekly class at Columbia was &quot;Theory and Methods of Investigation in Art.&quot;

He lectured at New York University (1932-1936), the New School for Social Research (1936-1952), Harvard University as the Charles Norton Lecturer (1966-1967) and Oxford University as Slade Professor of Art (1968). He was a visiting lecturer at the College de France in Paris in May 1974.

===Society===
Schapiro partook in the First American Artists&#x27; Congress Against War and Fascism in 1935, which produced a petition signed by more than 300 artists including co-founders Stuart Davis, Adolph Dehn, William Gropper, Hugo Gellert, Saul Schary and Moses Soyer, as well as fellow artists Milton Avery, Ilya Bolotowsky, Alexander Calder, Adolph Gottlieb, Jack Kufeld, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, J. B. Neumann, Isamu Noguchi, Ben Shahn, Raphael Soyer, James Johnson Sweeney, Max Weber, George Biddle, Paul Cadmus, Philip Evergood, Lorser Feitelson and Lewis Mumford. Schapiro and Gottlieb publicly resigned within the month when the congress did not condemn the Soviet invasion of Finland. Schapiro and other dissenters, including Mark Rothko, Gottlieb, Harris and Bolotowsky, condemned dictatorships in Germany, Russia, Italy, Spain and Japan and founded a Cultural Committee which became the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors.

Schapiro was a proponent of modern art, on which he published essays alongside books on Van Gogh and Cézanne. He was a founder of &quot;Dissent&quot;, along with Irving Howe and Michael Harrington. From 1966–1967 Schapiro was the Norton professor at Harvard University.

Schapiro&#x27;s discourse on style is often considered his greatest contribution to the study of art history. He said style refers to the formal qualities and visual characteristics of a piece of art, and demonstrated it could be used as an identifier of a particular period and as a diagnostic tool. Style is indicative of the artist and the culture at large. It reflects the economic and social circumstances in which an artist works and breathes and reveals underlying cultural assumptions and normative values.

==Personal life and death==

Schapiro&#x27;s brother was financier Morris Schapiro. His grand-nephew is artist Jacob Collins.

In 1931, Schapiro married pediatrician Lillian Milgram. They had two children, Miriam Schapiro Grosof and Ernest Schapiro.

He died in 1996 in New York at the age of 91 in the Greenwich Village house where he had lived since 1933.

==Impact==

===Artists===
In the 1940s, when the Museum of Modern Art looked at purchasing Jackson Pollock&#x27;s &quot;The She-Wolf&quot; (1943), Schapiro, as an acquisitions committee member, supported its acquisition.

In the 1950s, Schapiro urged Willem de Kooning to finish painting &quot;Woman I&quot; (1950-1952).

===Marxist art history===
Schapiro was, at points in his career, criticized for his approach to style because of its politically radical connotations. He wrote scholarly articles for a variety of socialist publications and endeavored to apply a novel Marxist method to the study of art history. In his most famous essay on Medieval Spanish art, &quot;From Mozarabic to Romanesque in Silos&quot;, Schapiro demonstrated how the concurrent existence of two historical styles in one monastery was indicative of economic upheaval and class conflict.

Schapiro&#x27;s students include:
* Sigmund Abeles
* Jonathan Crary
* Helen Frankenthaler
* Peter Golfinopoulos
* Michael Hafftka
* Carroll Janis
* Allan Kaprow
* Hilton Kramer
* Robert Motherwell
* Dorothy Miner
* David Rosand
* William Rubin
* Lucas Samaras
* Virginia Wright
* Barbara Rose

===Portraits===
Alice Neel painted his portrait in 1947 and 1983. (Schapiro portrayed himself many times, including this young image.)

<doc id="414708" wikidata="Q6395896" url="?curid=414708" title="Kevin Brennan (comedian)">
<text>Kevin Brennan is an American stand-up comedian, podcaster, and writer. He is the host of the &quot;Misery Loves Company&quot; podcast, and is best known for his work on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; &quot;Weekend Update&quot; in 1999 and 2000.

Brennan was voted &quot;Best Comedian&quot; at the 2005 Aspen Comedy Festival and his half-hour stand-up special was featured on HBO that same year. He was featured on the 2007 cross-Canada Just for Laughs comedy tour and performed at the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal in 2009. He was also a repeat panelist on &quot;Red Eye w/ Tom Shillue&quot; in 2016 and 2017.

==Early life==
Brennan was born in Chicago to an Irish Catholic family and has nine siblings. The family also lived in Philadelphia.

==Career==

=== Early career (1980s–1998) ===
Brennan first started stand-up in Chicago in the 1980s at the suggestion of a coworker at a restaurant where he was working. He moved to New York City in 1987 to further pursue a career in stand up comedy.

Within two years of moving to New York City, Brennan was hosting open mics and other comedy shows at the Boston Comedy Club, a now defunct comedy club in New York City. By the early 1990s he was appearing on A&amp;E&#x27;s stand-up comedy series &quot;An Evening at the Improv&quot; and &quot;Caroline&#x27;s Comedy Hour&quot;.

In 1993, Brennan appeared on the entertainment competition show &quot;Star Search&quot; where he competed unsuccessfully against 19-year-old Dave Chappelle.

Brennan first appeared as a guest on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; in 1994 and went on to make multiple appearances on the show from 1995 to 2007.

In 1997, Brennan appeared in a small role in the film &quot;Half Baked&quot;, which was co-written by his brother Neal Brennan and Chappelle. By this time Brennan was established in the New York comedy circuit and had appeared twice on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. That same year the Brennan brothers had a development deal with NBC and Universal for a sitcom based on their own experiences growing up in an Irish-Catholic family with 10 kids in Philadelphia.

=== &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (1999–2000) ===
Brennan was a writer for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1999 and 2000 and also appeared on the show as a &quot;Weekend Update&quot; correspondent in two episodes of the show&#x27;s 25th season while Colin Quinn held the anchor post. Quinn left &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 2000 and Brennan was in contention for the anchor position but, after the job was given to Jimmy Fallon and Tina Fey, Brennan decided not to return as a writer for the following season.

=== Post &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (2001–present) ===
From 2003 to 2005 Brennan made multiple appearances on &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot;. Brennan was voted “Best Comedian” at the 2005 Aspen Comedy Festival, which led to his half-hour stand-up special on the HBO series &quot;One Night Stand&quot; that same year. He was one of six comedians featured on the 2007 cross-Canada Just for Laughs comedy tour, which also featured Greg Behrendt, John Wing, Louis Ramey, Fiona O&#x27;Loughlin and Tom Papa. He also performed at the Just For Laughs festival in Montreal in 2009. In 2011, Brennan wrote for the Comedy Central series &quot;Sports Show with Norm Macdonald&quot;.

====&quot;Misery Loves Company&quot;====
Brennan started the comedic podcast titled Misery Loves Company (MLC) in January 2016, and added fellow New York-based comedian Lenny Marcus as his co-host. Marcus quit the podcast after ten months following several on-air and off-air disagreements between the two comedians.

====&quot;Burning Bridges&quot;====
In 2017, Compound Media owner and former &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot; radio personality Anthony Cumia, a fan of Brennan&#x27;s tirades against other comedians on &quot;Misery Loves Company&quot; (including Brennan&#x27;s brother, Neal), brought Brennan to his Compound Media network, where Brennan hosted &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; with co-host Brian Mccarthy. Brennan and Mccarthy left Compound Media in 2019.

==Other ventures==
In 2018 he produced a live comedy show in New York City called &quot;White Guys Matter&quot; that was billed as &quot;all white guys&quot; and &quot;no safe spaces&quot; with the promise to &quot;make comedy great again.&quot; Comedian Aaron Berg, who performed at the New York show, brought the show to Yuk Yuk&#x27;s comedy club in Toronto, Canada that same year, causing several local comedians to take to social media to protest the show.

Brennan played himself in an episode of Pete Holmes&#x27; HBO series &quot;Crashing&quot; that aired in 2019. A roast of Kevin Brennan was held at The Stand comedy club in New York City that same year. Roasters at the event included comedians Dan Soder, Jim Norton (in character as Chip Chipperson), Krystyna Hutchinson and Corinne Fischer of the &quot;Guys We Fucked&quot; podcast, Patty Rosborough, Chad Zumock and Mike Bocchetti.

In October 2022, Brennan, along with fellow comedian Bob Levy, opened a comedy club called the &quot;Brennan &amp; Levy&#x27;s Comedy Loft&quot; in Vineland, New Jersey.

==Comedic style==
Brennan&#x27;s delivery has been described as &quot;laid-back&quot; and &quot;laconic&quot;. He is also known for insult comedy directed at members of the audience, and for jokes about racism, pedophilia and misogyny. As his podcast title &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; suggests, Brennan is also known for confrontational statements about other comedians and podcasters. Brennan drew public criticism for his remarks about the unexpected death of &quot;Friends&quot; actor Matthew Perry on social media, in late October 2023.

In a 2017 interview with &quot;New York&quot; magazine, comedian Jim Gaffigan was quoted as saying: &quot;I am a New York comedian in the vein of like Dave Attell and Kevin Brennan, where they&#x27;re supposed to laugh at your jokes and not like you.&quot;

==Personal life==
Brennan is married and resides in New Jersey. His youngest brother is Neal Brennan, comedian and co-creator of &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;.

<doc id="414712" wikidata="Q4928846" url="?curid=414712" title="Blue Ash (band)">
<text>Blue Ash is an American band, formed in Ohio in the summer of 1969 by bassist Frank Secich &amp; vocalist Jim Kendzor. Guitarist Bill Yendrek and drummer David Evans were recruited later that summer.

The band debuted at &quot;The Freak Out&quot;, a club in Youngstown, Ohio, on October 3, 1969. They gained a loyal following playing an endless stream of one-nighters over that year. In October 1970, Bill Yendrek, was replaced by guitarist/songwriter Bill &quot;Cupid&quot; Bartolin.

Blue Ash continued playing 250–300 dates a year throughout Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio and West Virginia, while the songwriting team Frank Secich and Bill Bartolin accumulated an enormous amount of original material. In June 1972, Blue Ash signed a production contract with Peppermint Productions of Youngstown and started recording and sending out demos. In late 1972, they were signed to Mercury Records by A&amp;R man Paul Nelson. Their first album &quot;No More, No Less&quot; was released in May 1973 and received rave reviews in the rock press. It is considered a power pop classic, and is regarded as highly collectible among fans of that genre (it was finally released on CD on the Collectors&#x27; Choice label in September 2008). Blue Ash toured and opened for such acts as the Stooges, Bob Seger, Aerosmith, Ted Nugent and more but for lack of sales they were dropped by Mercury Records in May 1974.

Blue Ash continued to play live and record, adding drummer Jeff Rozniata who replaced David Evans in 1974. They were signed to a singles deal with Playboy Records in 1977. The first single, &quot;Look At You Now&quot; became a regional hit in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Mississippi, as well as in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Playboy then offered an album deal. The LP &quot;Front Page News&quot; was recorded in Los Angeles in August 1977 and released in October of that year. It was selling well, but in early 1978 Playboy International pulled the plug on Playboy Records and Blue Ash was once again without a label. They called it quits in 1979.

A few audience-recorded live tapes of the band exist (including one of the original lineup from January 31, 1974, at the Packard Music Hall in Warren, OH) but are of generally poor recording quality. Other tapes recorded by a fan who followed Blue Ash to many of their gigs are rumored to exist, but have yet to surface on the collectors circuit.

In the summer of 2003 original members Frank Secich, David Evans, Bill Bartolin and Jim Kendzor got together privately in Ohio to play once again and decided to reform the band. On November 8 they played the International Pop Overthrow at the Khyber Pass in Philadelphia.

In the late 1990s, renewed interest toward the band was given a boost as a large cache of unreleased Blue Ash recordings fell into circulation amongst collectors. In the summer of 2004 an official release of that material, a two CD retrospective called &quot;Around Again&quot;, was released on Not Lame Records. It contains 44 songs of unreleased material spanning their career.

For their &quot;reunion&quot; gigs from 2003–2009, Frank Secich moved from bass guitar to rhythm guitar, and former members Brian Wingrove (piano) and Jeff Rozniata (drums) completed the band along with Bobby Darke (bass).

On October 3, 2009, guitarist Bill &quot;Cupid&quot; Bartolin died from complications of cancer, thus bringing to a sad end the story of Blue Ash.

Frank Secich is now a member of Deadbeat Poets, who have released three critically acclaimed CDs: &quot;Notes From The Underground&quot; (2007), &quot;Circustown&quot; (2010) and &quot;Youngstown Vortex Sutra&quot; in 2011.

In the late 1990s, Jim Kendzor&#x27;s nephew, guitarist Leonard Crist, and Bill &quot;Cupid&quot; Bartolin&#x27;s son, drummer Sean Bartolin, formed Cork, a short-lived band based out of Youngstown while Crist played in the Youngstown indie rock bands Savage Pastry, Isabella the Brave, You Are The War That I Want and Abortopotamus Rex.

In 2016, original Blue Ash members Frank Secich and Jim Kendzor began performing as Blue Ash, backed by Secich&#x27;s current band Deadbeat Poets. Sometimes jocularly referred to as Half Ash, this configuration toured Spain, a hotbed of power pop fandom, to great acclaim in June 2016. Secich, Kendzor and Deadbeat Poets member Pete Drivere have also performed several acoustic shows.

<text>Helen Rosemary Clark (&quot;née&quot; Dyche; born 23 December 1954) is an English politician. She was the Labour Member of Parliament for the Peterborough constituency from 1997 until the 2005 general election, when she lost her seat to Conservative Stewart Jackson. She was elected to Parliament as Helen Brinton in the elections of 1997 and 2001, before taking her married name in the latter year.

==Early life==

Clark was born in Derby. She went to Spondon Park Grammar School (became Spondon School in 1971 when merged with Spondon House School, and became West Park Community School in 1989) in Spondon, Derby. Clark was educated at the University of Bristol gaining a Hons 2/1 in English Literature, then an MA in Medieval Literature and a PGCE. She worked as a teacher for several years as an assistant English teacher at Katherine Lady Berkeley Comprehensive in Wotton-under-Edge from 1979 to 1982, then Deputy Head of English at Harrogate Ladies&#x27; College from 1983 to 1988. She was a lecturer at North Thanet FIE College from 1992 to 1993, then an English teacher and Head of Year 8 at the Rochester Grammar School for Girls from 1993 until her election in 1997. From 1985 to 1987 she worked as an Examiner, Assessor, Moderator and Team Leader in English Literature for the Northern, Southern, London and Cambridge Examination Boards.

==Parliamentary career==
Clark had previously stood unsuccessfully as the Labour candidate for Faversham in Kent in the 1992 general election. For the subsequent 1997 general election she was selected, from an all-women shortlist., as the Labour candidate for Peterborough in Cambridgeshire. She was elected to parliament with a majority of 7,323, defeating; two future Members of the European Parliament; Jacqueline Foster and David Howarth.

Whilst in Parliament, Clark had an interest in wildlife issues and was a leading Labour voice in opposition to violent animal rights protests. She was a member of the Environmental Audit Select Committee and Broadcasting Select Committees; completed the NCVO parliamentary scheme with secondments to ASBAH and MIND and founded the All Party Wildlife Group. The Bill committees she sat on included Finance Bill, Water Bill and Countryside &amp; Rights of Way Bill.

Early on in her parliamentary career, Clark was considered loyal to her party leaders, but later opposed the Iraq War.

She was defeated for re-election in the 2005 general election by Conservative candidate Stewart Jackson. Three days after her defeat, she resigned from the Labour Party. In a letter to Labour Leader Tony Blair, she was critical of policies such as top-up fees and the Iraq War. Clark suggested that were Kenneth Clarke to win the Tory leadership she might be tempted to switch sides. However, it was subsequently reported she had not joined the Conservative Party, and did not intend to. She re-joined the Labour Party in 2010 and is a member of UNISON.

==After parliament==
In April 2007, Clark was interviewed by &quot;The Observer&quot;. This was for an article about the female Labour MP&#x27;s elected in the 1997 general election, known as Blair&#x27;s Babes. She criticised the treatment of newly elected MPs by the Parliamentary Labour Party.

Since 2005 she has worked as Head of Policy &amp; Campaigns for the Multiple Sclerosis Society; Interim Climate Change Advisor for the Association of British Insurers; Associate Consultant for the National Youth Agency and Assessor for the OCR examination board in addition to writing. Clark campaigns of availability of Alzheimers Drugs on the NHS. She is a member of the Chartered Institute of Assessors.

Clark was involved in an incident in 2008 when video footage of her complaining to bar staff about their refusal to serve her was posted on YouTube. After Clark threatened legal action over the availability of the video, she was charged with public order offences. Clark was found guilty of using threatening words and behaviour. However, the conviction was quashed upon appeal.

==Personal life==
She married Alan Clark, a political journalist with Meridian television, in August 2001. Clark has two children from her previous marriage.

<text>In human anatomy, the forehead is an area of the head bounded by three features, two of the skull and one of the scalp. The top of the forehead is marked by the hairline, the edge of the area where hair on the scalp grows. The bottom of the forehead is marked by the supraorbital ridge, the bone feature of the skull above the eyes. The two sides of the forehead are marked by the temporal ridge, a bone feature that links the supraorbital ridge to the coronal suture line and beyond. However, the eyebrows do not form part of the forehead.

In &quot;Terminologia Anatomica&quot;, &quot;sinciput&quot; is given as the Latin equivalent to &quot;forehead&quot; (etymology of &quot;sinciput&quot;: from &quot;semi-&quot; &quot;half&quot; and &quot;caput&quot; &quot;head&quot;.).

==Structure==
The bone of the forehead is the squamous part of the frontal bone. The overlying muscles are the occipitofrontalis, procerus, and corrugator supercilii muscles, all of which are controlled by the temporal branch of the facial nerve.

The sensory nerves of the forehead connect to the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve and to the cervical plexus, and lie within the subcutaneous fat. The motor nerves of the forehead connect to the facial nerve. The ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, the supraorbital nerve, divides at the orbital rim into two parts in the forehead. One part, the superficial division, runs over the surface of the occipitofrontalis muscle. This provides sensation for the skin of the forehead, and for the front edge of the scalp. The other part, the deep division, runs into the occipitofrontalis muscle and provides frontoparietal sensation.

Blood supply to the forehead is via the left and right superorbital, supertrochealar, and anterior branches of the superficial temporal artery.

==Function==

=== Expression ===
The muscles of the forehead help to form facial expressions. There are four basic motions, which can occur individually or in combination to form different expressions. The occipitofrontalis muscles can raise the eyebrows, either together or individually, forming expressions of surprise and quizzicality. The corrugator supercilii muscles can pull the eyebrows inwards and down, forming a frown. The procerus muscles can pull down the centre portions of the eyebrows.

=== Wrinkles ===
The movements of the muscles in the forehead produce characteristic wrinkles in the skin. The occipitofrontalis muscles produce the transverse wrinkles across the width of the forehead, and the corrugator supercilii muscles produce vertical wrinkles between the eyebrows above the nose. The procerus muscles cause the nose to wrinkle.

==Society and culture==
In physiognomy and phrenology, the shape of the forehead was taken to symbolise intellect and intelligence. &quot;Animals, even the most intelligent of them,&quot;, wrote Samuel R. Wells in 1942, &quot;can hardly be said to have any forehead at all, and in natural total idiots it is very diminished&quot;.

Pseudo-Aristotle, in &quot;Physiognomica&quot;, stated that the forehead is governed by Mars. A low and little forehead denoted magnanimity, boldness, and confidence; a fleshy and wrinkle-free forehead, litigiousness, vanity, deceit, and contentiousness; a sharp forehead, weakness and fickleness; a wrinkled forehead, great spirit and wit yet poor fortune; a round forehead, virtue and good understanding; a full large forehead, boldness, malice, boundary issues, and high spirit; and a long high forehead, honesty, weakness, simplicity, and poor fortune.

In fighting, slamming one&#x27;s forehead into one&#x27;s opponent is termed a headbutt.

<text>Dame Annette Lesley Brooke, DBE (&quot;née&quot; Kelly; born 7 June 1947) is a British Liberal Democrat politician. She was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Mid Dorset and North Poole from the 2001 general election to 2015. In 2001, she became the first female MP elected in a general election in Dorset. At the time she left office, Brooke was the longest serving female MP in the history of the Liberal Democrats. 

As of 2024, she and fellow Liberal Democrats, Diana Maddock and Vikki Slade, and Labour&#x27;s Jessica Toale, are the only women to date who represented parliamentary constituencies in Dorset. 

==Early life==
Annette Lesley Kelly was educated at Romford County Technical School in Romford and the London School of Economics, graduating with a BSc degree in Economics. She qualified as a teacher at Hughes Hall, Cambridge. She was a tutor with the Open University for 19 years from 1971 and was a school teacher from 1974, including at Aylesbury, and then Head of Economics at the independent Talbot Heath School for Girls in Bournemouth, which she left in 1994.

==Parliamentary career==
Annette Brooke was elected as a councillor on Poole Borough Council in 1986; she was the council&#x27;s deputy leader 1995–7 and 1998–2000, and the Liberal Democrat Group Leader 2000–1. She was the Mayor of Poole in 1998. She contested the Conservative-held seat of Mid Dorset and North Poole at the 2001 General Election.

At the previous election the Conservative Christopher Fraser won the seat by 681 votes. In 2001 Annette Brooke was elected by 384 votes and held the seat until 2015 where it was regained by the Conservatives. She made her maiden speech on 21 June 2001.

In Parliament she was made both a Liberal Democrat Whip and a Spokeswoman on Home Affairs by Charles Kennedy in 2001. In 2004 she became a spokeswoman on Children. Following the 2005 General Election (at which Annette Brooke held her seat with a much increased majority of 5,482), she became a spokeswoman on Education and Skills, and carried on in a similar position as spokeswoman on Children, Schools and Families.

In the 2010 General Election, Brooke&#x27;s majority fell to 269 votes; a reduction of 5,213 votes. Her main challenger for the seat, Nick King (Conservative), secured a swing of 7.7% making her constituency one of the most marginal of the 2010 Election. Following the defeat of Sandra Gidley in the 2010 General Election, Brooke became the longest-serving female Liberal Democrat MP of the 55th parliament.

Brooke announced in 2013 that she would stand down as a Member of Parliament at the next general election in 2015.

==Personal life and honours==
In May 2005, she met Hollywood actress Natalie Portman to discuss the microfinance charity, FINCA International, and their joint plans to help the world&#x27;s poorest people become self-sufficient. She is married to Michael (former geology schoolteacher, and councillor on Poole Borough Council since 2003) with two daughters, and is a partner in her family firm selling rocks and minerals, started in 1987. They live in Broadstone.

Brooke was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for public and political service. She was elevated to a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2015 Dissolution Honours Lists on 27 August 2015. She was appointed to the Privy Council on 16 July 2014.

<doc id="414726" wikidata="Q1612283" url="?curid=414726" title="Brockenhurst">
<text>Brockenhurst is the largest village by population within the New Forest in Hampshire, England. The nearest city is Southampton some to the north-east, while Bournemouth is also nearby, south-west. Surrounding towns and villages include Beaulieu, Lymington, Lyndhurst, and Sway.

==History==
The earliest signs of habitation in Brockenhurst date back 4,000 years to the Bronze Age: the area is dotted with burial mounds – called tumuli. Beyond that, few signs remain of other habitation during the subsequent 3,000 years.

===Middle Ages===
The Saxon period was brought to an end by the events of 1066.

William the Conqueror created his Nova Foresta traditionally in 1079, a vast hunting area lying south and west of his capital at Winchester; it stretched south to the coast at Barton on Sea and west to what is now Bournemouth. In 1086, the Domesday Book recorded that there were four small Saxon manors in the Brockenhurst area, &quot;Mapleham&quot;, &quot;Hincelveslei&quot;, &quot;Brochelie&quot; and &quot;Broceste&quot;. &quot;Mapleham&quot; no longer exists, probably being subsumed within Brookley; the name &quot;Hincelveslei&quot; has become &quot;Hinchelsea&quot; which lies to the west of Brockenhurst. The third manor, &quot;Brochelie&quot;, gives the modern name, Brookley, which was granted a regular weekly market and an annual fair, lasting several days, in 1347. Brochelie had forest rights to graze sheep on the open forest, but only between Wilverley and what is now Rhinefield Road, this right is usually associated with religious houses and was probably attached to the medieval estate which Christchurch Priory held at Brookley.

The manor house of &quot;Brochelie&quot; was situated on the plot formerly occupied by the Watersplash Hotel and now the Holmwood apartments built by Pegasus Homes and opened in 2019. Its manor itself extended over the lands on the western side of the A337 Lyndhurst-Lymington Road.

The fourth Saxon manor of the area was &quot;Broceste&quot; which gives the village its name. It was the most important manor, being a grand-serjeanty held by providing accommodation for the King when hunting in the area.

Royden to the south of Brockenhurst was a medieval grange belonging to Netley Abbey and was set up by a grant made by Henry III in 1253.

St Nicholas&#x27; Church, at that time, was no more than an outlying chapel linked to Twynham – later Christchurch Priory. William Rufus visited Brockenhurst, possibly worshiping in St Nicholas&#x27; church, as at least two writs were issued by him from here.

===Early modern era===
By the 18th century, nearby Lymington was a thriving town, due to its port and the manufacture of salt from sea water. In 1765, the Lymington road became a turnpike, under the Lymington, Lyndhurst and Rumbridge Turnpike Act, and a regular route for the mail coaches from Lyndhurst and the north. During this time, Brockenhurst grew in size, with dwellings and inns strung along the main road.

In 1745, Henry Thurston, a local man who left to make his fortune in London, died, leaving a bequest to set up a school in the village. After being held in a number of houses it became fixed in a cottage on the corner of what is now Mill Lane and the A337.

A tower was added to St. Nicholas&#x27; Church between 1758 and 1763.

In 1770, Edward Morant, using some of the vast wealth that flowed from the family estates in Jamaica, purchased – a late Stuart farmhouse – for £6,400. He rebuilt it as a large Georgian mansion, while he and his heirs laid out avenues in the grounds and acquired adjacent land, eventually peaking at some 3,000 acres (12 km2).

In the 19th century the railway station was introduced to Brockenhurst, increasing a large number of holiday visitors and the local population.

Brockenhurst gained its second Church of England church in 1903 in the form of St Saviour&#x27;s. The reason for its construction was that Mabel Walker-Munro didn&#x27;t want to use the same church as members of the Morant family.

===First World War===
In the First World War, Brockenhurst hosted the Lady Hardinge Hospital for Wounded Indian Soldiers. The name Meerut Road recalls the Indian troops of the Meerut and Lahore Divisions who fought on the Western Front in the war and were patients at Brockenhurst. Specialist sections were also established in the Balmer Lawn and Forest Park Hotels.

The hospital was later transferred to the New Zealand Army and, as No. 1 New Zealand General Hospital, continued in use until 1919. Auckland Avenue and Auckland Place commemorate the stay of the New Zealanders.


===Interwar===
Cass Gilbert, the noted American architect of the Woolworth Building and many other structures, died in the town in 1934.
The Roman Catholic church of St Anne was built between 1937 and 1939.

===Second World War===
In the Second World War, what is now The Balmer Lawn Hotel was often used as a Divisional HQ and was the location of many of Generals Montgomery and Eisenhower&#x27;s meetings, away from their headquarters in Southsea, as they planned the D-Day Landings in Normandy.

In early 1944, Brockenhurst also became a secret training area for troops preparing to do battle in Normandy. The area&#x27;s ancient oak trees were ideal for concealing military vehicles. The 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, the core of Assault Force &quot;G&quot;, tasked with storming Gold Beach on D-Day, had its HQ at the Carey&#x27;s Manor Hotel.

Afterwards, the Eastern Warfare School, near Brockenhurst, taught jungle infantry tactics suited to the Asian and Pacific campaigns, to personnel from the Royal Marines and shore units of the Royal Navy.

===Since 1945===

The western part of the village greatly expanded in the 1970s and, in the early 1990s, Berkeley Homes built Ober Park, which is now known as The Coppice, this despite having been known as Clerks (or variations thereof) from the 13th to 19th centuries. More construction of the village still continues today by Pennyfarthing Homes.

==Sport and leisure==

=== Football ===
Brockenhurst F.C. was founded in 1898 and plays at Grigg Lane, the current manager is Danny Ackland. In season 2012/13 the club returned to the Wessex Premier Football League as Division One champions and reached the final of both the Southamption DFA Senior Cup and the Wessex League Cup. During a Hampshire Senior Cup match Brockenhurst (and Andover Town) set a new record when they scored 29 consecutive penalties in a shoot-out after the tie had finished 0–0. After 29 successful attempts (a total confirmed by the Football Association as an English record) Andover missed and &#x27;The Badgers&#x27; won the tie.

=== Cricket ===
Brockenhurst Cricket Club was founded in 1797 and has been situated on the Balmer Lawn for over 150 years. Brockenhurst Cricket Club has two senior Saturday teams that compete in the Hampshire Cricket League, a Friendly Sunday XI team, and a junior section that play in the New Forest District Cricket league.

==Transport==
Brockenhurst railway station offers frequent South Western Railway services to Bournemouth, London Waterloo, Southampton and Weymouth. CrossCountry express services also run twice daily to Manchester via Birmingham.

The station is the junction where the branch line to Lymington Pier connects to the mainline. The &quot;Lymington Flyer&quot; services connect with the ferry to Yarmouth on the Isle of Wight. The branch line is a heritage line and its self-contained nature permitted the use of slam-door rolling stock, until this was withdrawn in 2010. In 1967 it was the last standard-gauge branch line in the south of England to cease using steam haulage. Historically, before the infamous Beeching Cuts in the 1960s, services ran to Ringwood from Brockenhurst via Holmsley and others.

Bus transport is provided mainly by Bluestar service 6 to Lymington and Southampton (Previously the Wilts &amp; Dorset 56 and 56A, the 6 now runs the route of the 56A). In the summer, the New Forest Tour serves the village and station.

==Twinning==
Brockenhurst is twinned with Pont St Martin, in Loire-Atlantique, France.

<doc id="414733" wikidata="Q266000" url="?curid=414733" title="Russell Brown (British politician)">
<text>Russell Leslie Brown (born 17 September 1951) is a Scottish Labour Party politician. He is a former Member of Parliament (MP) for Dumfriesshire (1997–2005) and Dumfries and Galloway (2005–2015). He lost his seat at the 2015 general election to Richard Arkless of the Scottish National Party.

==Early years ==
Russell Brown was born in Annan, Scotland, and attended the local Annan Academy. In 1974 he began work as a plant operative at ICI and remained with the company until his election to Westminster.

==Political history==
He was elected as a branch chairman within the Transport and General Workers Union 1979–1985. In 1986, Brown was elected as a councillor to the Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council, and was the Labour Group Leader 1995–97. Between 1988 and 1996 he also served as a councillor on the Annandale and Eskdale District Council.

He was selected to contest the seemingly safe Conservative and Unionist seat of Dumfries at the 1997 UK General Election. The MP of 33 years, Hector Monro retired and the Conservative and Unionist candidate was Struan Stevenson. The Conservative Party were completely wiped out in Scotland in 1997, and he was elected as the Labour MP for Dumfries with a majority of 9,643 votes. He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on Monday 7 July 1997.

Russell Brown became a Member of the Scottish Affairs Select committee in 1999, and left the committee after the 2001 general election. He was made a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Leader of the House of Lords, Gareth Wyn Williams of Mostyn in 2002. When Williams died in 2003, he continued in the same position with his successor Valerie Amos. Brown resigned from the government in 2003 in protest at the proposed military intervention in Iraq, stepping down from his position as parliamentary aide to Lord Williams of Mostyn, leader of the House of Lords. Brown subsequently &quot;voted against saying that the case for war against Iraq has not yet been established&quot; and was absent for the vote to declare war.

In the major redistribution of Scottish seats, his constituency of Dumfries was abolished and the new seat of Dumfries and Galloway was created. At the 2005 general election he faced the sitting Conservative MP for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale Peter Duncan. Brown defeated Duncan, and was elected with a majority of 2,922 votes. Following the general election, he became the PPS to the Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Darling and his successor Jim Murphy.

At the 2010 general election Russell Brown was again challenged by Peter Duncan, the Conservative MP he defeated five years previously; who is now a councillor on Dumfries and Galloway Council. Despite Labour losing the election nationally, Russell Brown&#x27;s popularity locally meant he almost tripled his majority to 7,449 votes. In October 2010, Russell Brown was appointed to Labour&#x27;s front bench as a Shadow Defence Minister. His brief was Shadow Minister for International Security Strategy. He was also a member of the Public Bill Committee for the Defence Reform Act.

Brown lost his seat at the 2015 general election, finishing in third place with 13,982 votes behind the Scottish Conservatives&#x27; Finlay Carson with 16,926 votes and the winner: SNP&#x27;s Richard Arkless with 23,440 votes.

== Personal life==
He married Christine Margaret Calvert in 1973 and they have two daughters together. He speaks French and German. Brown is a supporter of Queen of the South. He has appeared on television speaking about the club, and tabled an early day motion in the House of Commons congratulating them on their reaching the semi-final of the 2008 Scottish Cup. As of 2023, Brown was the vice-chairman of his hometown football club Annan Athletic.

<doc id="414736" wikidata="Q208388" url="?curid=414736" title="Isochoric process">
<text>In thermodynamics, an isochoric process, also called a constant-volume process, an isovolumetric process, or an isometric process, is a thermodynamic process during which the volume of the closed system undergoing such a process remains constant. An isochoric process is exemplified by the heating or the cooling of the contents of a sealed, inelastic container: The thermodynamic process is the addition or removal of heat; the isolation of the contents of the container establishes the closed system; and the inability of the container to deform imposes the constant-volume condition.

==Formalism==
An isochoric thermodynamic quasi-static process is characterized by constant volume, i.e., .
The process does no pressure-volume work, since such work is defined by
formula_1
where is pressure. The sign convention is such that positive work is performed by the system on the environment.

If the process is not quasi-static, the work can perhaps be done in a volume constant thermodynamic process.

For a reversible process, the first law of thermodynamics gives the change in the system&#x27;s internal energy:
formula_2

Replacing work with a change in volume gives
formula_3

Since the process is isochoric, , the previous equation now gives
formula_4

Using the definition of specific heat capacity at constant volume, , where is the mass of the gas, we get
formula_5

Integrating both sides yields
formula_6
where is the specific heat capacity at constant volume, is the initial temperature and is the final temperature. We conclude with:
formula_7
On a pressure volume diagram, an isochoric process appears as a straight vertical line. Its thermodynamic conjugate, an isobaric process would appear as a straight horizontal line.

===Ideal gas===
If an ideal gas is used in an isochoric process, and the quantity of gas stays constant, then the increase in energy is proportional to an increase in temperature and pressure. For example a gas heated in a rigid container: the pressure and temperature of the gas will increase, but the volume will remain the same.

==Ideal Otto cycle==
The ideal Otto cycle is an example of an isochoric process when it is assumed that the burning of the gasoline-air mixture in an internal combustion engine car is instantaneous. There is an increase in the temperature and the pressure of the gas inside the cylinder while the volume remains the same.

==Etymology==
The noun &quot;isochor&quot; and the adjective &quot;isochoric&quot; are derived from the Greek words ἴσος (&quot;isos&quot;) meaning &quot;equal&quot;, and χῶρος (&quot;khôros&quot;) meaning &quot;space.&quot;

<doc id="414738" wikidata="Q1142798" url="?curid=414738" title="Surge protector">
<text>A surge protector (or spike suppressor, surge suppressor, surge diverter, surge protection device (SPD), transient voltage suppressor (TVS) or transient voltage surge suppressor (TVSS)) is an appliance or device intended to protect electrical devices in alternating current (AC) circuits from voltage spikes with very short duration measured in microseconds, which can arise from a variety of causes including lightning strikes in the vicinity.

A surge protector limits the voltage supplied to the electrical devices to a certain threshold, by short-circuiting current to ground or absorbing the spike when a transient occurs, thus avoiding damage to the devices connected to it.

Key specifications that characterize this device are: the clamping voltage, or the transient voltage at which the device starts functioning, the Joule rating, a measure of how much energy can be absorbed per surge, and the response time.

== Definitions ==
The terms &quot;surge protection device&quot; (&quot;SPD&quot;) and &quot;transient voltage surge suppressor&quot; (&quot;TVSS&quot;) are used to describe electrical devices typically installed in power distribution panels, process control systems, communications systems, and other heavy-duty industrial systems, for the purpose of protecting against electrical surges and spikes, including those caused by lightning. Scaled-down versions of these devices are sometimes installed in residential service entrance electrical panels, to protect equipment in a household from similar hazards.

== Voltage spikes ==
In an AC circuit, a voltage spike is a transient event, typically lasting 1 to 30 microseconds, that may reach over 1,000 volts. Lightning that hits a power line can cause a spike of thousands of volts. A motor when switched off can generate a spike of 1,000 or more volts. Spikes can degrade wiring insulation and destroy electronic devices like light bulbs, battery chargers, modems, TVs, and other consumer electronics.

Spikes can also occur on telephone and data lines when AC main lines accidentally connect to them or lightning hits them, or if the telephone and data lines travel near lines with a spike and the voltage is induced.

A long-term overvoltage surge, lasting seconds, minutes, or hours, caused by power transformer failures such as a lost neutral or other power company error, are not protected by transient protectors. Long-term surges can destroy the protectors in an entire building or area. Even tens of milliseconds can be longer than a protector can handle. Long-term surges may or may not be handled by fuses and overvoltage relays.

=== Surge currents ===

A building&#x27;s wiring adds electrical impedance that limits the surge current that reaches the loads when a voltage transient arrives at the service entrance (the point where the supply company&#x27;s wiring enters a property). There is less surge current at longer wire distances and where more impedance is present between the service entrance and the load.

Category A loads are more than 60 feet of wire length from the service entrance to the load. Category A loads can be exposed to and surge currents. Category B loads are between 30 and 60 feet of wire length from the service entrance to the load. Category B loads can be exposed to and . Category C loads are less than 30 feet from the service entrance to the load. Category C loads can be exposed to and .

A coiled extension cord can be used to increase the wire length to more than 60 feet and increase the impedance between the service entrance and the load.

== Protectors ==
A transient surge protector attempts to limit the voltage supplied to an electric device by either blocking or shorting current to reduce the voltage below a safe threshold. Blocking is done by using inductors which inhibit a sudden change in current. Shorting is done by capacitors which inhibit a sudden change in voltage or by spark gaps, discharge tubes, Zener effect semiconductors, and metal-oxide varistors (MOVs), all of which begin to conduct current once a certain voltage threshold is reached. Some surge protectors use multiple elements.

In the shorting method the electrical lines are temporarily shorted together (as by a spark gap) or clamped to a target voltage (as by a MOV) resulting in a large current flow. The voltage spike is reduced as the shorting current flows through the resistance in the power lines. The spike&#x27;s energy is dissipated in the power lines or the ground, or in the protector, converted to heat. Since a spike lasts only tens of microseconds, the temperature rise is minimal. However, if the spike is large enough or long enough, the protector can be destroyed and power lines damaged.

Surge protectors for homes can be in power strips used inside, or a device outside at the power panel. Sockets in a modern house use three wires: line, neutral and ground. Many protectors will connect between all three in pairs (line–neutral, line–ground and neutral–ground), because there are conditions, such as lightning, where both line and neutral have high voltage spikes that need to be shorted to ground.

Additionally, some consumer-grade protectors have ports for Ethernet, cable television and plain old telephone service, and plugging them in allows the surge protector to shield them from external electrical damage.

The characteristic of a TVS requires that it respond to overvoltages faster than other common overvoltage protection components such as varistors or gas discharge tubes. This makes TVS devices or components useful for protection against very fast and often damaging voltage spikes. These fast overvoltage spikes are present on all distribution networks and can be caused by either internal or external events, such as lightning or motor arcing.

Applications of transient voltage suppression diodes are used for unidirectional or bidirectional electrostatic discharge protection of transmission or data lines in electronic circuits. MOV-based TVSs are used to protect home electronics, distribution systems and may accommodate industrial-level power distribution disturbances saving downtime and damage to equipment. The level of energy in a transient overvoltage can be equated to energy measured in joules or related to electric current when devices are rated for various applications. These bursts of overvoltage can be measured with specialized electronic meters that can show power disturbances of thousands of volts amplitude that last for a few microseconds or less.

It is possible for a MOV to overheat when exposed to overvoltage sufficient for the MOV to start conducting, but not enough to totally destroy it, or to blow a house fuse. If the overvoltage condition persists long enough to cause significant heating of the MOV, it can result in thermal damage to the device and start a fire.

===Comparison of transient suppressors===
== Domestic use ==
Many power strips have basic surge protection built in; these are typically clearly labeled as such. However, in countries without regulations, there are power strips labeled as &quot;surge&quot; or &quot;spike&quot; protectors that only have a capacitor, an RFI circuit, or nothing at all and do &quot;not&quot; provide surge protection.

==Industrial use==
A surge arrester, surge protection device (SPD) or transient voltage surge suppressor (TVSS), is used to protect equipment in power transmission and distribution systems. The energy criterion for various insulation material can be compared by impulse ratio. A surge arrester should have a low impulse ratio, so that a surge incident on the surge arrester may be bypassed to the ground instead of passing through the apparatus.

To protect a unit of equipment from transients occurring on an attached conductor, a surge arrester is connected to the conductor just before it enters the equipment. The surge arrester is also connected to ground and functions by routing energy from an over-voltage transient to ground if one occurs, while isolating the conductor from ground at normal operating voltages. This is usually achieved through use of a varistor, which has substantially different resistances at different voltages.

Surge arresters are not generally designed to protect against a direct lightning strike to a conductor, but rather against electrical transients resulting from lightning strikes occurring in the vicinity of the conductor. Lightning which strikes the earth results in ground currents which can pass over buried conductors and induce a transient that propagates outward towards the ends of the conductor. The same kind of induction happens in overhead and above ground conductors which experience the passing energy of an atmospheric EMP caused by the lightning flash.

Surge arresters can only protect against induced transients characteristic of a lightning discharge&#x27;s rapid rise-time, and will not protect against electrification caused by a direct strike to the conductor. Transients similar to lightning-induced, such as from a high voltage system&#x27;s fault switching, may also be safely diverted to ground; however, continuous overcurrents are not protected against by these devices. The energy in a handled transient is substantially less than that of a lightning discharge; however it is still of sufficient quantity to cause equipment damage and often requires protection.

Without very thick insulation, which is generally cost prohibitive, most conductors running more than minimal distances (greater than approximately ) will experience lightning-induced transients at some time during use. Because the transient is usually initiated at some point between the two ends of the conductor, most applications install a surge arrester just before the conductor lands in each piece of equipment to be protected. Each conductor must be protected, as each will have its own transient induced, and each SPD must provide a pathway to earth to safely divert the transient away from the protected component.

The one notable exception where they are not installed at both ends is in high voltage distribution systems. In general, the induced voltage is not sufficient to do damage at the electric generation end of the lines; however, installation at the service entrance to a building is key to protecting downstream products that are not as robust.

== Important specifications ==

These are some of the most prominently featured specifications which define a surge protector for AC mains, as well as for some data communications protection applications.

=== Clamping voltage ===
Also known as the let-through voltage, this specifies what spike voltage will cause the protective components inside a surge protector to short or clamp. A lower clamping voltage indicates better protection, but can sometimes result in a shorter life expectancy for the overall protective system. The lowest three levels of protection defined in the UL rating are 330 V, 400 V and 500 V. The standard let-through voltage for 120 V AC devices is 330 volts.

Underwriters Laboratories (UL), a global independent safety science company, defines how a protector may be used safely. UL 1449 became compliance mandatory in jurisdictions that adopted the NEC with the 3rd edition in September 2009 to increase safety compared to products conforming to the 2nd edition. A measured limiting voltage test, using six times higher current (and energy), defines a voltage protection rating (VPR). For a specific protector, this voltage may be higher compared to a Suppressed Voltage Ratings (SVR) in previous editions that measured let-through voltage with less current. Due to non-linear characteristics of protectors, let-through voltages defined by 2nd edition and 3rd edition testing are not comparable.

A protector may be larger to obtain a same let-through voltage during 3rd edition testing. Therefore, a 3rd edition or later protector should provide superior safety with increased life expectancy.

A protector with a higher let-through voltage, e.g. 400 V vs 330 V, will pass a higher voltage to the connected device. The design of the connected device determines whether this pass-through spike will cause damage. Motors and mechanical devices are usually not affected. Some (especially older) electronic parts, like chargers, LED or CFL bulbs and computerized appliances are sensitive and can be compromised and have their life reduced.

=== Joule rating ===
The Joule rating number defines how much energy a MOV-based surge protector can theoretically absorb in a single event, without failure. Better protectors exceed ratings of 1,000 joules and 40,000 amperes. Since the actual duration of a spike is only about 10 microseconds, the actual dissipated energy is low. Any more than that and the MOV will fuse, or sometimes short and melt, hopefully blowing a fuse, disconnecting itself from the circuit.

The MOV (or other shorting device) requires resistance in the supply line in order to limit the voltage. For large, low resistance power lines a higher joule rated MOV is required. Inside a house, with smaller wires that have more resistance, a smaller MOV is acceptable.

Every time an MOV shorts, its internal structure is changed and its threshold voltage reduced slightly. After many spikes the threshold voltage can reduce enough to be near the line voltage, i.e. 120 vac or 240 vac. At this point, the MOV will partially conduct and heat up and eventually fail, sometimes in a dramatic meltdown or even a fire. Most modern surge protectors have circuit breakers and temperature fuses to prevent serious consequences. Many also have an LED light to indicate if the MOVs are still functioning.
The joule rating is commonly quoted for comparing MOV-based surge protectors. An average surge (spike) is of short duration, lasting for nanoseconds to microseconds, and experimentally modeled surge energy can be less than 100 joules. Well-designed surge protectors consider the resistance of the lines that supply the power, the chance of lightning or other seriously energetic spike, and specify the MOVs accordingly. A little battery charger might include a MOV of only 1 watt, whereas a surge strip will have a 20 watt MOV or several of them in parallel. A house protector will have a large block-type MOV.

Some manufacturers commonly design higher joule-rated surge protectors by connecting multiple MOVs in parallel and this can produce a misleading rating. Since individual MOVs have slightly different voltage thresholds and non-linear responses when exposed to the same voltage curve, any given MOV might be more sensitive than others. This can cause one MOV in a group to conduct more (a phenomenon called current hogging), leading to possible overuse and eventual premature failure of that component. However the other MOVs in the group do help a little as they start to conduct as the voltage continues to rise as it does since a MOV does not have a sharp threshold. It may start to short at 270 volts but not reach full short until 450 or more volts. A second MOV might start at 290 volts and another at 320 volts so they all can help clamp the voltage, and at full current there is a series ballast effect that improves current sharing, but stating the actual joule rating as the sum of all the individual MOVs does not accurately reflect the total clamping ability. The first MOV may bear more of the burden and fail earlier.

One MOV manufacturer recommends using fewer but bigger MOVs (e.g. 60 mm vs 40 mm diameter) if they can fit in the device. It is further recommended that multiple smaller MOVs be matched and derated. In some cases, it may take four 40 mm MOVs to be equivalent to one 60 mm MOV.

A further problem is that if a single inline fuse is placed in series with a group of paralleled MOVs as a disconnect safety feature, it will open and disconnect all remaining working MOVs.

The &quot;effective&quot; surge energy absorption capacity of the entire system is dependent on the MOV matching so derating by 20% or more is usually required. This limitation can be managed by using carefully &quot;matched sets&quot; of MOVs, matched according to manufacturer&#x27;s specification.

According to industry testing standards, based on IEEE and ANSI assumptions, power line surges inside a building can be up to 6,000 volts and 3,000 amperes, and deliver up to 90 joules of energy, including surges from external sources not including lightning strikes.

The common assumptions regarding lightning specifically, based ANSI/IEEE C62.41 and UL 1449 (3rd ed.) at time of this writing, are that minimum lightning-based power line surges inside a building are typically 10,000 amperes or 10 kiloamperes (kA). This is based on 20 kA striking a power line, the imparted current then traveling equally in both directions on the power line with the resulting 10 kA traveling into the building or home. These assumptions are based on an average approximation for testing minimum standards. While 10 kA is typically good enough for minimum protection against lightning strikes, it is possible for a lightning strike to impart up to 200 kA to a power line with 100 kA traveling in each direction.

Lightning and other high-energy transient voltage surges can be suppressed with pole-mounted suppressors by the utility, or with an owner-supplied whole-house surge protector. A whole-house product is more expensive than simple single-outlet surge protectors and often needs professional installation on the incoming electrical power feed; however, they prevent power line spikes from entering the house. Damage from direct lightning strikes via other paths, such as telephone lines, must be controlled separately.

=== Response time ===

Surge protectors do not operate instantly; a slight delay exists, some few nanoseconds. With longer response time and depending on system impedance, the connected equipment may be exposed to some of the surge. However, surges typically are much slower and take around a few microseconds to reach their peak voltage, and a surge protector with a nanosecond response time would kick in fast enough to suppress the most damaging portion of the spike.

Thus response time under standard testing is not a useful measure of a surge protector&#x27;s ability when comparing MOV devices. All MOVs have response times measured in nanoseconds, while test waveforms usually used to design and calibrate surge protectors are all based on modeled waveforms of surges measured in microseconds. As a result, MOV-based protectors have no trouble producing impressive response-time specs.

Slower-responding technologies (notably, GDTs) may have difficulty protecting against fast spikes. Therefore, good designs incorporating slower but otherwise useful technologies usually combine them with faster-acting components, to provide more comprehensive protection.

=== Standards ===
Some frequently listed standards include:
* IEC 61643-11 Low-voltage surge protective devices – Part 11: Surge protective devices connected to low-voltage power systems – Requirements and test methods (replaces IEC 61643-1)
* IEC 61643-21 Low voltage surge protective devices – Part 21: Surge protective devices connected to telecommunications and signalling networks – Performance requirements and testing methods
* IEC 61643-22 Low-voltage surge protective devices – Part 22: Surge protective devices connected to telecommunications and signalling networks – Selection and application principles
* EN , 61643-21 and 
* Telcordia Technologies Technical Reference TR-NWT-001011
* ANSI/IEEE C62.xx
* Underwriters Laboratories (UL) 1449
* AS/NZS 1768

Each standard defines different protector characteristics, test vectors, or operational purpose.

The 3rd Edition of UL Standard 1449 for SPDs was a major rewrite of previous editions, and was also accepted as an ANSI standard for the first time. A subsequent revision in 2015 included the addition of low-voltage circuits for USB charging ports and associated batteries.

EN 62305 and ANSI/IEEE C62.xx define what spikes a protector might be expected to divert. EN 61643-11 and 61643-21 specify both the product&#x27;s performance and safety requirements. In contrast, the IEC only writes standards and does not certify any particular product as meeting those standards. IEC Standards are used by members of the CB Scheme of international agreements to test and certify products for safety compliance.

None of those standards guarantee that a protector will provide proper protection in a given application. Each standard defines what a protector should do or might accomplish, based on standardized tests that may or may not correlate to conditions present in a particular real-world situation. A specialized engineering analysis may be needed to provide sufficient protection, especially in situations of high lightning risk.

In addition, the following standards are not standards for standalone surge protectors, but are instead meant for testing surge immunity in electrical and electronic equipment as a whole. Thus, they&#x27;re frequently used in the design and test of surge protection circuitry.

* IEC 61000-4-2 Electrostatic discharge immunity test
* IEC 61000-4-4 Electrical fast transient/burst immunity test
* IEC 61000-4-5 Surge immunity test

== Primary components ==
Systems used to reduce or limit high-voltage surges can include one or more of the following types of electronic components. Some surge suppression systems use multiple technologies, since each method has its strong and weak points. The first six methods listed operate primarily by diverting unwanted surge energy away from the protected load, through a protective component connected in a &quot;parallel&quot; (or shunted) topology. The last two methods also block unwanted energy by using a protective component connected in &quot;series&quot; with the power feed to the protected load, and additionally may shunt the unwanted energy like the earlier systems.

=== Metal oxide varistor ===
A metal-oxide varistor (MOV) consists of a bulk semiconductor material (typically sintered granular zinc oxide) that can conduct large currents when presented with a voltage above its rated voltage. MOVs typically limit voltages to about 3 to 4 times the normal circuit voltage by diverting surge current elsewhere than the protected load. MOVs may be connected in parallel to increase current capability and life expectancy, providing they are &quot;matched sets&quot;.

MOVs have finite life expectancy and degrade when exposed to a few large transients, or many small transients. Every time an MOV activates, its threshold voltage reduces slightly. After many spikes the threshold voltage can reduce enough to be near the protection voltage, either mains or data. At this point the MOV conducts more and more often, heats up and finally fails. In data circuits, the data channel becomes shorted and non-functional. In a power circuit, you may get a dramatic meltdown or even a fire if not protected by a fuse of some kind.

Modern surge strips and house protectors have circuit breakers and temperature fuses to prevent serious consequences. A thermal fuse disconnects the MOV when it gets too hot. Only the MOV is disconnected leaving the rest of the circuit working but without surge protection. Often there is an LED light to indicate if the MOVs are still functioning. Older surge strips had no thermal fuse and relied on a 10 or 15 amp circuit breaker which usually blew only after the MOVs had smoked, burned, popped, melted and permanently shorted.

A failing MOV is a fire risk, which is a reason for the National Fire Protection Association&#x27;s (NFPA&#x27;s) UL1449 standard in 1986 and subsequent revisions in 1998, 2009 and 2015. NFPA&#x27;s primary concern is protection from fire.

Therefore, all MOV-based protectors intended for long-term use should have an indicator that the protective components have failed, and this indication must be checked on a regular basis to ensure that protection is still functioning.

Because of their good price–performance ratio, MOVs are the most common protector component in low-cost basic AC power protectors.

=== Transient voltage suppression diode ===
A transient-voltage-suppression diode (TVS diode) is a type of avalanche diode which can limit voltage spikes. These components provide the fastest limiting action of protective components (theoretically in picoseconds), but have a relatively low energy-absorbing capability. Voltages can be clamped to less than twice the normal operation voltage. If current impulses remain within the device ratings, life expectancy is exceptionally long. If component ratings are exceeded, the diode may fail as a permanent short circuit; protection may remain, but normal circuit operation is terminated in the case of low-power signal lines.

Due to their relatively limited current capacity, TVS diodes are often restricted to circuits with smaller current spikes. TVS diodes are also used where spikes occur significantly more often than once a year, since this type of component will not degrade when used within its ratings. A unique type of TVS diode (trade names Transzorb or Transil) contains reversed paired &quot;series&quot; avalanche diodes for bi-polar operation.

TVS diodes are often used in high-speed but low-power circuits, such as occur in data communications. These devices can be paired in &quot;series&quot; with another diode to provide low capacitance as required in communication circuits.

=== Thyristor surge protection device (TSPD) ===
A Trisil is a type of thyristor surge protection device (TSPD), a specialized solid-state electronic device used in crowbar circuits to protect against overvoltage conditions. A SIDACtor is another thyristor type device used for similar protective purposes.

These thyristor-family devices can be viewed as having characteristics much like a spark gap or a GDT, but can operate much faster. They are related to TVS diodes, but can &quot;break over&quot; to a low clamping voltage analogous to an ionized and conducting spark gap. After triggering, the low clamping voltage allows large current surges while limiting heat dissipation in the device.

=== Gas discharge tube (GDT) spark gap ===

A gas discharge tube (GDT) is a sealed glass-enclosed device containing a special gas mixture trapped between two electrodes, which conducts electric current after becoming ionized by a high voltage spike. GDTs can conduct more current for their physical size than other components. Like MOVs, GDTs have a finite life expectancy, and can handle a few very large transients or a greater number of smaller transients. The typical failure mode occurs when the triggering voltage rises so high that the device becomes ineffective, although lightning surges can occasionally cause a dead short.

GDTs take a relatively long time to trigger (longer than a lightning strike of 60 ns to 70 ns), permitting a higher voltage spike to pass through briefly before the GDT conducts significant current. It is not uncommon for a GDT to let through pulses of 500 V or more of 100 ns in duration.

In some cases, additional protective components are necessary to prevent damage to a protected load, caused by high-speed let-through voltage which occurs before the GDT begins to operate. The triggering voltages are typically 400–600 volts for gas tubes and those that are UL Standard 497 listed typically have high surge current ratings, 5,000 to 10,000 amperes (8x20 μs).

GDTs create an effective short circuit when triggered, so that if any electrical energy (spike, signal, or power) is present, the GDT will short. Once triggered, a GDT will continue conducting (called follow-on current), until all electric current sufficiently diminishes, and the gas discharge quenches. Unlike other shunt protector devices, a GDT once triggered will continue to conduct at a voltage &quot;less than&quot; the high voltage that initially ionized the gas; this behavior is called negative resistance.

Additional auxiliary circuitry may be needed in DC (and some AC) applications to suppress follow-on current, to prevent this from destroying the GDT after the initiating spike has dissipated. Some GDTs are designed to deliberately short out to a grounded terminal when overheated, thereby triggering an external fuse or circuit breaker.

Many GDTs are light-sensitive, in that exposure to light lowers their triggering voltage. Therefore, GDTs should be shielded from light exposure, or opaque versions that are insensitive to light should be used.

The CG2 SN series of surge arrestors, formerly produced by C P Clare, are advertised as being non-radioactive, and the datasheet for that series states that some members of the CG/CG2 series (75–470V) are inherently radioactive.

Due to their exceptionally low capacitance, GDTs are commonly used on high-frequency lines, such as those used in telecommunications equipment. Because of their high current-handling capability, GDTs can also be used to protect power lines, but the follow-on current problem must be controlled.

=== Selenium voltage suppressor ===

An &quot;overvoltage clamping&quot; bulk semiconductor similar to an MOV, though it does not clamp as well. However, it usually has a longer life than an MOV. It is used mostly in high-energy DC circuits, like the exciter field of an alternator. It can dissipate power continuously, and it retains its clamping characteristics throughout the surge event, if properly sized.

=== Carbon block spark gap overvoltage suppressor ===
A spark gap is one of the oldest protective electrical technologies still found in telephone circuits, having been developed in the nineteenth century. A carbon rod electrode is held with an insulator at a specific distance from a second electrode. The gap dimension determines the voltage at which a spark will jump between the two parts and short to ground. The typical spacing for telephone applications in North America is (0.003 inches). Carbon block suppressors are similar to gas arrestors (GDTs); but as the two electrodes are exposed to the air, their behavior is affected by the surrounding atmosphere, especially higher humidity. Since their operation produces an open spark, these devices should &quot;never&quot; be installed where an explosive atmosphere may develop.

=== Inductors, line reactors, chokes, capacitors ===
Inductors, line reactors, chokes, and capacitors are used to limit fault currents and can reduce or prevent overvoltage events. In applications that limit fault currents, inductors are more commonly known as electrical line reactors or a choke. Line reactors can prevent overvoltage trips, increase the reliability and life of solid state devices, and reduce nuisance trips.

=== Marshalling cabinet panels with surge protectors ===
Metal marshalling cabinet panels can allow surge protection device (SPD) failures to be contained remotely from digital devices and electrical controllers. Direct flashes of lightning and lightning surge on secondary systems can cause catastrophic failures of SPDs. Catastrophic failures of SPDs can release fireballs of metal fragments and clouds of conductive carbon soot. Marshalling panels keep such hazards from reaching the digital and control devices that are mounted in the remote main control panels. Marshalling cabinet panels are used for digital system panels (fire alarm, security access control, computer clean power, etc.). Wiring and cables to be protected include both the power supply and any wiring (signaling circuit, initiating device circuit, shields, etc.), which extend beyond the building by underground, overhead or other means, such as walkways, bridges, etc. In addition, it should include the wiring of devices located in high places such as attics, roof levels of parking lots, parking lights, etc. After passing through the SPDs in the marshalling cabinets, the wiring can pass through conduits into other remote, nearly adjacent, cabinets that contain the input &amp; output connections to for digital system panels (fire alarm, security access control, computer clean power, programmable logic controllers (PLCs), etc.

=== Quarter-wave coaxial surge arrestor ===

Used in RF signal transmission paths, this technology features a tuned quarter-wavelength short-circuit stub that allows it to pass a bandwidth of frequencies, but presents a short to any other signals, especially down towards DC. The passbands can be narrowband (about ±5% to ±10% bandwidth) or wideband (above ±25% to ±50% bandwidth). Quarter-wave coax surge arrestors have coaxial terminals, compatible with common coax cable connectors (especially N or 7-16 types). They provide the most rugged available protection for RF signals above ; at these frequencies they can perform much better than the gas discharge cells typically used in the universal/broadband coax surge arrestors. Quarter-wave arrestors are useful for telecommunications applications, such as Wi-Fi at 2.4 or but less useful for TV/CATV frequencies. Since a quarter-wave arrestor shorts out the line for low frequencies, it is not compatible with systems which send DC power for a LNB up the coaxial downlink.

=== Series mode (SM) surge suppressors ===
These devices are not rated in joules because they operate differently from the above listed suppressors, and they do not depend on materials that inherently wear out during repeated surges. SM suppressors are primarily used to control transient voltage surges on electrical power feeds to protected devices. They are essentially heavy-duty low-pass filters connected so that they allow 50 or 60 Hz line voltages through to the load, while blocking and diverting higher frequencies. This type of suppressor differs from others by using banks of inductors, capacitors and resistors that suppress voltage surges and inrush current to the neutral wire, whereas other designs shunt to the ground wire. Surges are not diverted but actually suppressed. The inductors slow the energy. Since the inductor in series with the circuit path slows the current spike, the peak surge energy is spread out in the time domain and harmlessly absorbed and slowly released from a capacitor bank.

Experimental results show that most surge energies occur at under 100 joules, so exceeding the SM design parameters is unlikely. SM suppressors do not present a fire risk should the absorbed energy exceed design limits of the dielectric material of the components because the surge energy is also limited via arc-over to ground during lightning strikes, leaving a surge remnant that often does not exceed a theoretical maximum (such as 6000 V at 3000 A with a modeled shape of 8 × 20 microsecond waveform specified by IEEE/ANSI C62.41). Because SMs work on both the current rise and the voltage rise, they can safely operate in the worst surge environments.

SM suppression focuses its protective philosophy on a &quot;power supply input&quot;, but offers nothing to protect against surges appearing between the input of an SM device and &quot;data lines&quot;, such as antennae, telephone or LAN connections, or multiple such devices cascaded and linked to the primary devices. This is because they do not divert surge energy to the ground line. Data transmission requires the ground line to be clean in order to be used as a reference point. In this design philosophy, such events are already protected against by the SM device before the power supply. NIST reports that &quot;Sending them [surges] down the drain of a grounding conductor only makes them reappear within a microsecond about 200 meters away on some other conductor.&quot; So having protection on a data transmission line is only required if surges are diverted to the ground line.

SM devices tend to be bulkier and heavier than devices using other surge suppression technologies. The initial costs of SM filters are higher, typically and up, but a long service life can be expected if they are used properly. In-field installation costs can be higher, since SM devices are installed in &quot;series&quot; with the power feed, requiring the feed to be cut and reconnected.

<text>The Official Journal of the European Union (the OJEU) is the official gazette of record for the European Union (EU). It is published every working day in all of the official languages of the member states of the EU. Only legal acts published in the &quot;Official Journal&quot; are binding.

== History ==
It was first published on 30 December 1952 as the &quot;Official Journal of the European Coal and Steel Community&quot;, then renamed &quot;Official Journal of the European Communities&quot; with the establishment of the European Community, before taking its current title when the Treaty of Nice entered into force on 1 February 2003.

Since 1998, the journal has been available online via the EUR-Lex service. On 1 July 2013, published issues of the &quot;Official Journal&quot; began to have legal value only in electronic form, per Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 216/2013. From this date, the printed version has lost its legal value. Each issue is published as a set of documents in PDF/A format (one per official language) plus one XML document ensuring the overall coherency through hashes and a &quot;qualified electronic signature&quot; (a kind of digital signature defined in European law) extended with a trusted time stamp.

On 1 October 2023, the Official Journal switched to act-by-act publication. In this new production mode, the Official Journal is no longer a collation of acts with a table of contents. Instead, each act is published individually as an authentic Official Journal in PDF format.

== Publication ==
The journal comprises three series:
* The L series (= Legislation) contains EU legislation including regulations, directives, decisions, recommendations, and opinions.
* The C series (= Courts) contains reports and announcements, including the judgments of the European Court of Justice and the General Court (formerly known as the Court of First Instance).
* The S series (= Supplement) contains invitations to tender for public contracts, along with other notices issued by the European Development Fund and other agencies.

<text>The European Communities (EC) were three international organizations that were governed by the same set of institutions. These were the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom), and the European Economic Community (EEC), the last of which was renamed the &quot;European Community&quot; (&quot;EC&quot;) in 1993 by the Maastricht Treaty establishing the European Union. The European Union was established at that time more as a concept rather than an entity, while the Communities remained the actual subjects of international law impersonating the rather abstract Union, becoming at the same time its first pillar. In popular language, however, the singular &quot;European Community&quot; was sometimes used interchangeably with the plural phrase, in the sense of referring to all three entities.

The European Coal and Steel Community ceased to exist in 2002 when its founding treaty expired. The European Community was merged with the second and third EU pillars by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009, finally allowing the European Union to move beyond being only a concept and to assume the shape of a legally incorporated international organization with juridical personality, designated as the legal successor to the Community. However, the reformed EU has not become entirely unified, because Euratom, though governed with the EU by the common set of institutions, has been retained as an entity distinct from the EU, along with a number of other international entities, such as the European Investment Bank, the European University Institute, the European Stability Mechanism, and the Unified Patent Court.

==History==
===Three communities===
The ECSC was created first. Following its proposal in 1950 in the Schuman Declaration, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany came together to sign the Treaty of Paris in 1951 which established the Community. The success of this Community led to the desire to create more, but attempts at creating a European Defence Community and a European Political Community failed leading to a return to economic matters. In 1957, the EAEC and EEC were created by the Treaties of Rome. They were to share some of the institutions of the un ECSC but have separate executive structures.
The ECSC&#x27;s aim was to combine the coal and steel industries of its members to create a single market in those resources. It was intended that this would increase prosperity and decrease the risk of these countries going to war through the process of European integration. The EAEC was working on nuclear energy co-operation between the members. The EEC was to create a customs union and general economic co-operation. It later led to the creation of a European single market.

The EEC became the European Community pillar of the EU, with the ECSC and EAEC continuing in a similar subordinate position, existing separately in a legal sense but governed by the institutions of the EU as if they were its own. The ECSC&#x27;s treaty had a 50-year limit and thus expired in 2002; all its activities are now absorbed into the European Community. The EAEC had no such limit and thus continues to exist. Given that nuclear power is a very sensitive issue for the European electorate, the Euratom Treaty has gone without amendment since its signing, and was not even to be changed with the European Constitution intended to repeal all other treaties (the Constitution&#x27;s replacement, the Treaty of Lisbon, likewise makes no attempt at amendment).

As the EAEC has a low profile, and the profile of the European Community is dwarfed by that of the EU, the term &quot;European Communities&quot; sees little usage. However, when the EU was established the institutions that dealt solely or mainly with the European Community (as opposed to all three pillars) retained their original names, for example the formal name of the European Court of Justice was the &quot;Court of Justice of the European Communities&quot; until 2009.

In 1967, the Merger Treaty combined these separate executives. The Commission and Council of the EEC were to take over the responsibilities of its counterparts in the other organisations. From then on they became known collectively as the &quot;European Communities&quot;, for example the commission was known as the &quot;Commission of the European Communities&quot;, although the communities themselves remained separate in legal terms.

===Structural evolution of the European Commission===
===Pillar===

The Maastricht Treaty built upon the Single European Act and the Solemn Declaration on European Union in the creation of the European Union. The treaty was signed on 7 February 1992 and came into force on 1 November 1993. The emerging Union integrated the European Communities as its institutional core and one of its three pillars. The first Commission President following the creation of the EU was Jacques Delors, who briefly continued his previous EEC tenure before handing over to Jacques Santer in 1994.

The first pillar was the only one established according to then-innovative principles of supranationalism. The pillar structure of the EU allowed the areas of European co-operation to be increased without leaders handing a large amount of power to supranational institutions. The pillar system segregated the EU. What were formerly the competencies of the EEC fell within the European Communities pillar. Justice and Home Affairs was introduced as a new pillar while European Political Cooperation became the second pillar (the Common Foreign and Security Policy).

The Communities institutions became the institutions of the EU but the roles of the institutions between the pillars are different. The commission, Parliament and Court of Justice are largely cut out of activities in the second and third pillars, with the Council dominating proceedings. This is reflected in the names of the institutions, the council is formally the &quot;Council of the &quot;European Union&quot;&quot; while the commission is formally the &quot;Commission of the &quot;European Communities&quot;&quot;. This allowed the new areas to be based on intergovernmentalism (unanimous agreement between governments) rather than majority voting and independent institutions according to supranational democracy.

However, after the Treaty of Maastricht, Parliament gained a much bigger role. Maastricht brought in the codecision procedure, which gave it equal legislative power with the Council on Community matters. Hence, with the greater powers of the supranational institutions and the operation of Qualified Majority Voting in the council, the Communities pillar could be described as a far more federal method of decision making.

The Amsterdam Treaty transferred rule making powers for border controls, immigration, asylum and cooperation in civil and commercial law from the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) pillar to the European Community (JHA was renamed Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters (PJCC) as a result). Both Amsterdam and the Treaty of Nice also extended codecision procedure to nearly all policy areas, giving Parliament equal power to the Council in the Community.

In 2002, the Treaty of Paris which established the European Coal and Steel Community (one of the three communities which comprised the European Communities) expired, having reached its 50-year limit (as the first treaty, it was the only one with a limit). No attempt was made to renew its mandate; instead, the Treaty of Nice transferred certain of its elements to the Treaty of Rome and hence its work continued as part of the EC area of the Communities remit.

The Treaty of Lisbon merged the three pillars and abolished the European Community, with the European Union becoming the Community&#x27;s legal successor. Only one of the three European Communities still exists, thus making the designation of &quot;European Communities&quot; obsolete.

The abolition of the pillar structure was proposed already under the European Constitution which ultimately failed to pass the ratification process.

==EU evolution timeline==
==Institutions==

By virtue of the Merger Treaty, all three Communities were governed by the same institutional framework. Prior to 1967, the Common Assembly/European Parliamentary Assembly and the Court of Justice, established by the ECSC, were already shared with the EEC and EAEC, but they had different executives. The 1967 treaty gave the Council and Commission of the EEC responsibility over ECSC and EAEC affairs, abolishing the Councils of the ECSC and EAEC, the Commission of the EAEC and the High Authority of the ECSC. These governed the three Communities until the establishment of the European Union in 1993.

==Members==

The three Communities shared the same membership, the six states that signed the Treaty of Paris and subsequent treaties were known as the &quot;Inner Six&quot; (the &quot;outer seven&quot; were those countries who formed the European Free Trade Association). The six founding countries were France, West Germany, Italy and the three Benelux countries: Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The first enlargement was in 1973, with the accession of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Greece, Spain and Portugal joined in the 1980s. Following the creation of the EU in November 1993, it has enlarged to include a further sixteen countries by July 2013.


Member states are represented in some form in each institution. The Council is also composed of one national minister who represents their national government. Each state also has a right to one European Commissioner each, although in the European Commission they are not supposed to represent their national interest but that of the Community. Prior to 2004, the larger members (France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) had two Commissioners. In the European Parliament, members are allocated a set number seats related to their population, however these (since 1979) have been directly elected and they sit according to political allegiance, not national origin. Most other institutions, including the European Court of Justice, have some form of national division of its members.

==Policy areas==

At the time of its abolition, the Community pillar covered the following areas:
==Privileges and immunities==
The Protocol on the privileges and immunities of the European Communities grants the European Communities and their institutions certain privileges and immunities such as to allow them to perform their tasks. The International Organizations Immunities Act (22 USC § 288h) of the United States has also been extended to the European Communities.

The working conditions of staff are governed by the Communities&#x27; staff regulations and not directly by the labour laws of the countries of employment. Their salaries, wages and emoluments are subject to a tax for the benefit of the European Communities and are, in turn, exempt from national taxes.

<text>Corey Todd Taylor (born December 8, 1973) is an American musician, songwriter, author and actor. He is the lead vocalist of the heavy metal band Slipknot, in which he is designated #8, as well as the lead vocalist, guitarist, lyricist, and sole continuous member of the rock band Stone Sour.

Taylor co-founded Stone Sour with drummer Joel Ekman in 1992, playing in the Des Moines, Iowa area, and working on a demo. He joined Slipknot in late 1997 to replace their original lead singer Anders Colsefni and has subsequently released seven studio albums with them. After the first two Slipknot albums went Platinum, Taylor revived Stone Sour to record an album and tour in 2002. His debut solo studio album, &quot;CMFT&quot;, was released in 2020. His second solo studio album, &quot;CMF2&quot;, was released on September 15, 2023.

Taylor has also worked with several other acts, including Junk Beer Kidnap Band, Korn, Disturbed, Apocalyptica, Code Orange, Anthrax, Steel Panther, Tonight Alive, Falling in Reverse, Soulfly, Damageplan, Tech N9ne, and the Clay People.

==Early life==
Corey Todd Taylor was born on December 8, 1973, in Des Moines, Iowa. He was mostly raised by his single mother in Waterloo, Iowa, and described it as a &quot;hole in the ground with buildings around it&quot;. He is of German, Irish and Native American descent on his father&#x27;s side, and Dutch and Irish on his mother&#x27;s side. Taylor, along with his mother and younger half-sister, would often move around the country in search for job prospects. By the time he was 15, he had &quot;already lived in 25 states&quot;. Around 1979, Taylor and his mother saw the sci-fi series &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;. Before the series, there was a trailer for the 1978 horror film &quot;Halloween&quot;. Taylor said this &quot;developed some sense of Slipknot in [himself]&quot;. While &quot;Halloween&quot; introduced Taylor to masks and horror themes, Taylor&#x27;s grandmother introduced him to rock music, showing him a collection of Elvis Presley records from the 1950s to 1970s. He especially found songs like &quot;Teddy Bear&quot;, &quot;In the Ghetto&quot;, and &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; to appeal to his interests the most, describing them as &quot;good times&quot;. Taylor also began listening to Black Sabbath at a young age, beginning with their early work. He decided he wanted to become a singer when he and his cousin were singing along to Journey&#x27;s &quot;Separate Ways&quot;.

In 1983, when he was nine years old, his mother and her boyfriend moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to become security guards for Burt Reynolds&#x27; ranch. However, as they were driving there, they got stranded in Georgia and he lost some of his possessions. By age 15, he had developed a drug addiction and had overdosed on cocaine twice. By this time, he was living in Waterloo, but some time after this overdose, he returned to visit his grandmother in Des Moines, and according to Taylor, &quot;stayed and never went back [to his mother&#x27;s house].&quot; She took legal custody of him so that he could continue going to school, and she helped him buy musical equipment. He would later describe his grandmother as his &quot;strongest influence&quot; as well as his &quot;rock, foundation and stability.&quot; When Taylor was 18, he left his grandmother&#x27;s house and went to various places in Iowa, Des Moines being a place to which he frequently returned. Taylor attended Lincoln High School in Des Moines but did not graduate. He later earned his GED.

In 2017, on an episode of Viceland&#x27;s &quot;The Therapist&quot;, Taylor revealed that he was sexually abused at the age of 10 by a 16-year-old friend. Taylor stated that he never told anyone about the incident until he was &quot;probably 18&quot; because his abuser had &quot;...threatened to hurt me and threatened to hurt my mom&quot;. At age 18, when Taylor was living with his grandmother, he attempted suicide by way of overdose. His ex-girlfriend&#x27;s mother drove him to the hospital in Des Moines and doctors were able to resuscitate him. He describes this as the lowest point in his life.

==Music career==
===Stone Sour===
Taylor is a founding member of American hard rock band Stone Sour. After he formed the band in 1992 with drummer Joel Ekman, Shawn Economaki joined filling in the bass position, leaving the electric guitar position to be filled by Josh Rand. Stone Sour recorded a demo album in 1993, and another in 1994. In 1997, Taylor was approached by the metal band, Slipknot, resulting in him abandoning Stone Sour while they were recording a demo album with Sean McMahon at SR studios. Taylor did not return until five years later to record their debut album, &quot;Stone Sour&quot; in 2002. Both Taylor and guitarist Josh Rand contacted Jim Root, Slipknot&#x27;s guitarist, and Shawn Economaki, Stone Sour&#x27;s original bassist, to begin writing songs for their debut album. Drummer Joel Ekman came back on board as well. This &quot;reformation&quot; later resulted in Stone Sour recording at Catamount Studios in Cedar Falls, Iowa.

Their self-titled debut album was released August 27, 2002, and it debuted at number 46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Their second album, &quot;Come What(ever) May&quot; debuted at number four on the Billboard 200. It was released August 1, 2006, and charted on several different charts. &quot;Live in Moscow&quot; is currently their only album specifically released only for download. During the recording of the album, drummer Joel Ekman left the band for personal reasons. As a result, drummer Roy Mayorga was recruited, taking his place. The group released their third studio album, &quot;Audio Secrecy&quot;, on September 7, 2010.

Later, Corey Taylor announced the release of a concept double album with Stone Sour. The albums are titled &quot;House of Gold &amp; Bones&quot;. During the process of making the double album, bassist Shawn Economaki left the band. He was temporarily replaced for touring purposes by Johny Chow. The first part was released in October 2012 and the second part in April 2013. There are 23 songs in total, 11 on the first part and 12 on the second. In addition to these two albums is a four-part comic book series written by Taylor and published by &quot;Dark Horse Comics&quot;, which went on sale in 2013. With these albums came a story that was written by Taylor that coincide with the album. Fans can also construct a miniature &quot;house of gold and bones&quot; from the packaging design of the physical versions of the two albums. Taylor has also said that he would like to finish off the project by making the story into a movie but nothing has come of this yet.

===Slipknot===
In Des Moines, Iowa, Joey Jordison, Shawn Crahan, and Mick Thomson approached him asking him to join Slipknot. He agreed to go to one of their practices, and ended up singing in front of them. Of Slipknot&#x27;s nine members, Corey was the sixth to join the band. Performing with Slipknot, he would also come to be known as &quot;Number Eight&quot;, since the band follows a numbering scheme for its members, ranging from 0–8. According to Shawn Crahan, Corey wanted number eight, because it symbolizes infinity.

Feeling he could expand more inside Slipknot than in Stone Sour, Taylor temporarily quit Stone Sour, even though they were recording an album with Sean McMahon. Taylor&#x27;s first gig with Slipknot was on August 24, 1997, which according to band members did not go well. During his first gig, Taylor was performing with facepaint instead of a mask; however, for his second show on September 12, he wore a mask that resembles his debut album mask.
Taylor has recorded with Slipknot since the release of their second demo album, a self-titled demo used to promote the band to prospective labels and producers. As their permanent vocalist, he recorded with Slipknot at Indigo Ranch in Malibu, California, and released &quot;Slipknot&quot;, the band&#x27;s debut album that peaked at number one on the Top Heatseekers chart, went double platinum in the United States, and was included in the 2006 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. Taylor was accused of copyright infringement regarding the lyrics of the song &quot;Purity&quot;, but no action was taken. Taylor began recording for their second studio album, &quot;Iowa&quot;, in 2001 at Sound City and Sound Image in Van Nuys, Los Angeles. It was released August 28, 2001, and peaked at number one on the UK Albums Chart, as well as number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. While writing &quot;Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)&quot;, Taylor decided to write lyrics that would not warrant an explicit label. It peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;All Hope Is Gone&quot; was the first Slipknot album to peak at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

===Other work===
Taylor has appeared as a guest musician on albums by Soulfly, Apocalyptica, Damageplan, Steel Panther, and Code Orange. At one point, he was heavily involved in the recording of thrash metal band Anthrax&#x27;s album, &quot;Worship Music&quot;, but the sessions remain unreleased. He also contributed to the &quot;Roadrunner United&quot; all-star album in 2005, providing vocals for the song &quot;Rich Man&quot;. Taylor also made a brief appearance in Steel Panther&#x27;s singles &quot;Death to All but Metal&quot;, &quot;Eyes of a Panther&quot;, and &quot;Asian Hooker&quot;. In 2006, Taylor founded the record company Great Big Mouth Records. Taylor has produced two albums: Facecage&#x27;s self-titled album and Walls of Jericho&#x27;s &quot;Redemption&quot;. Taylor provided guest narration on the track &quot;Repentance&quot; for Dream Theater&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Systematic Chaos&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, Taylor confirmed that on January 13, 2009, he was planning on making a solo album, as well as returning to his side project Stone Sour after Slipknot&#x27;s All Hope Is Gone World Tour. Taylor has stated that he was writing songs that &quot;don&#x27;t fit either of his main bands.&quot; He describes them as a cross between Foo Fighters, Johnny Cash, and Social Distortion, saying that there&#x27;s &quot;a country background that comes built-in with living in Iowa&quot;.

On March 30, 2009, it was confirmed that Taylor and the Junk Beer Kidnap Band would be performing at Rockfest in 2009. The group performed on April 24, 2009, at People&#x27;s Court in Des Moines, Iowa, marking Taylor&#x27;s first official solo show. Taylor performs with his band the Dum Fux with Denny Harvey, who make covers for 1970s punk rock and 1980s hair metal. Taylor also performs with Audacious P, a band that is primarily a Tenacious D cover band. Rapper Tech N9ne confirmed that Taylor was to perform on his album &quot;K.O.D.&quot;, but was removed because Taylor did not submit his vocals in time, though he would later make an appearance on Tech&#x27;s 2015 album &quot;Special Effects&quot;, on the song &quot;Wither&quot;. Taylor recently admitted that he tried out for the vacant singer spot in the band Velvet Revolver, but said that it just did not work out. However, according to a recent &quot;Billboard&quot; article, it seems likely that he may in fact become the vocalist for Velvet Revolver, though no official confirmation has been made. Duff McKagan added that they can neither &quot;confirm or deny&quot; Taylor&#x27;s membership in the band but believes that Taylor is the &quot;real deal&quot;. Slash has since ruled Taylor out as the possible new vocalist explaining that &quot;[it] just wasn&#x27;t right&quot; although he does love him. Taylor has, however, recorded 10 new songs with the band, although drummer Matt Sorum stated it is unlikely they will ever be released. Taylor explained to Mark Hoppus on &quot;Hoppus on Music&quot; that he and McKagan were writing new music for a possible new supergroup.

On June 21, 2018, Taylor featured on the track &quot;The Hunt&quot; by metallic hardcore band Code Orange, the second track of the three-track EP &quot;The Hurt Will Go On&quot;. In April 2019, Taylor collaborated on the song &quot;Drugs&quot; by the band Falling in Reverse. In September 2019, he was featured on Nostalgia Critic&#x27;s parody album of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot; on a cover of the opening theme for &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;.
Taylor released his solo album, &quot;CMFT&quot;, on October 2, 2020, via Roadrunner Records. The first two singles, &quot;Black Eyes Blue&quot; and &quot;CMFT Must Be Stopped&quot;, were released on July 29, 2020. Despite charting relatively well, he would later accuse Roadrunner of doing little to promote &quot;CMFT&quot;.

Taylor mentioned in an October 3, 2020, interview about a followup album entitled &quot;CMF2&quot;, which would be completed prior to a tour supporting both it and &quot;CMFT&quot;. He contributed a cover of the Metallica song &quot;Holier Than Thou&quot; to the charity tribute album &quot;The Metallica Blacklist&quot;, released in September 2021.

Between January 18 and March 6, 2023, Taylor spent time at various studios working on &quot;CMF2&quot;. On April 27, 2023, Taylor signed a new record deal with BMG Rights Management to distribute &quot;CMF2&quot;, which will be released through his own imprint label, Decibel Cooper Recordings. The first single from the album, &quot;Beyond&quot;, was released on May 16, 2023.

==Style and influence==

Taylor told &quot;Loudwire&quot; in 2015 that if it were not for Faith No More, he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be here today&quot;. While recovering from an attempted suicide, he saw the band perform &quot;Epic&quot; live on the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards and the performance inspired him to begin writing and performing music again. He has also stated that Pearl Jam had hugely influenced and inspired his music, saying that the group was &quot;one of the biggest and best rock bands of all time&quot;.

The first two Slipknot albums with Taylor&#x27;s vocals, &quot;Slipknot&quot; and &quot;Iowa&quot;, both contain substantial explicit content. Many critics claimed Taylor relied on profanity, culminating in Slipknot&#x27;s third album, &quot;Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)&quot; largely lacking the use of swearing, as such did not warrant the explicit label. Compared with the previous vocalist for Slipknot, Anders Colsefni, Taylor has a vocal style that was characterized by the late, ex-drummer Joey Jordison as &quot;really good melodic singing&quot;. Taylor&#x27;s vocal style, which contains at times melodic singing, growling, screaming, shouting, and rapping, led him to place at number 86 on the Hit Parader&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time&quot; and is often compared to other vocalists such as Ivan Moody, John Bush, Phil Anselmo, and Jamey Jasta.

==Personal life==
On September 17, 2002, Taylor&#x27;s then-fiancée, Scarlett, gave birth to their son. Taylor also has a daughter from an earlier relationship. Taylor and Scarlett married on March 11, 2004, and divorced in 2007. On November 13, 2009, Taylor married Stephanie Luby at the Palms Hotel in Las Vegas. They had a daughter, but separated in 2017. On April 7, 2019, it was announced on his Instagram page that he became engaged to Alicia Dove, creator of the dance and performance group &quot;Cherry Bombs&quot;. On October 6, 2019, the pair married.

Taylor has had problems with alcoholism, which Scarlett helped him through as well as keeping him from ending his own life. In 2006, Taylor told MTV that he had attempted to jump off a balcony of the eighth floor of The Hyatt on Sunset Boulevard in 2003, but &quot;somehow [Scarlett] stopped me&quot;. This was later recanted by Taylor in an interview with Kerrang! radio and stated that it was, in fact, his friend Thom Hazaert who physically stopped him from jumping. Scarlett then told him that either he would have to get sober or she would annul their marriage. Before Stone Sour started recording &quot;Come What(ever) May&quot; in January 2006, Taylor was sober.

On August 3, 2009, he co-hosted the 2009 Kerrang! Awards alongside Scott Ian of Anthrax. The following year, they both once again co-hosted the Kerrang! Awards, where Taylor collected the K! Services to Metal award on behalf of Paul Gray, who died after an accidental overdose of morphine and fentanyl.

In early September 2010, Taylor announced that his book, &quot;Seven Deadly Sins: Settling the Argument Between Born Bad and Damaged Good&quot;, would be released on July 12, 2011, through Da Capo Press.

In August 2021, Taylor tested positive for COVID-19 after the conclusion of a solo tour in support of his album &quot;CMFT&quot;. He was symptomatic despite being vaccinated, and credited the vaccine for preventing him from becoming seriously ill.

Taylor politically identifies as a centrist and is also strongly opposed to cancel culture. In an interview with The Guardian in 2016 Taylor stated he was supporting Bernie Sanders.

He divides his time between homes in Des Moines, Iowa and Las Vegas, Nevada.

In 2016, he had to have surgery in his neck after, in his own words, &quot;broke [his] neck a while back [and] didn&#x27;t realize it&quot;.

<text>EUR-Lex is the official online database of European Union law and other public documents of the European Union (EU), published in 24 official languages of the EU. The Official Journal (OJ) of the European Union is also published on EUR-Lex. Users can access EUR-Lex free of charge and also register for a free account, which offers extra features.

== History ==
Data processing of legal texts at the European Commission started way back in the 1960s, still using punch cards at the time. A system was being developed to capture relationships between documents and analyse them to extract and re-use metadata, but also to make retrieval easier.

Through the years, the system and its scope grew as the Commission started collaborating with other institutions of the European Union and as the Union started expanding. It was named CELEX () and soon became a well-used interinstitutional tool.

While initially used only internally, the system went through various degrees of availability to the public, including offering content under commercial licences via private companies. Finally, in 1997 a web version was launched and named EUR-Lex, hosted by the Publications Office of the European Union.

The EUR-Lex website was opened to the public in 2001, while CELEX still existed as a separate database until the end of 2004. Subsequently, steps were undertaken to merge the two services and to make them completely free of charge.

With the accession of new countries to the European Union and advancements in web and data-processing technologies, the system needed to be improved. A new version was launched in 2004. In 2014 the website saw another major overhaul, including a new database called &quot;CELLAR&quot;. &quot;CELLAR&quot; stores in a single place all metadata and digital content managed by the Publications Office in a harmonized and standardized way.

An aligned parallel corpus consisting of 3.9 million EUR-Lex documents in 24 languages, ranging in size from 37 million tokens for Irish to 840 million tokens for English, was produced in 2016 and made available in the Sketch Engine. Unannotated data is provided to researchers under a Creative Commons license. At the time of publication, the authors considered the EUR-Lex Corpus the largest parallel corpus built from European language resources, more suitable for linguistically motivated searches than the EUR-Lex official website.

== Content ==
On EUR-Lex users can access documents in the official EU languages. Language coverage depends on the date of the accession of a country to the EU. All EU law in force on the date of the accession of a new Member State is available in the language of the acceding country as are all documents adopted after this date. Documents repealed or expired before the date of accession are not available in the language of the acceding country.

Irish has been an official EU language since 1 January 2007. However, for practical reasons and on a transitional basis, the institutions of the Union have been exempted from the obligation to draft or translate all acts, including judgments of the Court of Justice, in the Irish language. The derogation was reviewed every five years until Irish received full status as a working language of the EU joining the other 23 official languages of the EU on 1 January 2022. It is gradually reduced according to a timetable annexed to Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2015/2264.

While each document (and each language version) is an individual part of the database, the content is grouped into sectors. There are currently 12 sectors, each represented by a number or a letter:
* 1 - Treaties
* 2 – International agreements
* 3 – Legal acts
* 4 – Complementary legislation
* 5 – Preparatory documents 
* 6 – Case-law 
* 7 – National transposition measures 
* 8 – References to national case-law concerning EU law
* 9 – Parliamentary questions 
* 0 – Consolidated texts 
* C – Other documents published in the Official Journal C series 
* E – EFTA documents

=== Official Journal of the European Union ===
In 1998 the Official Journal of the European Union (OJ) started being published online, on EUR-Lex. From 1 July 2013, the digital version of the Official Journal bears legal value instead of the paper version, which is now printed on demand only. The e-OJ has an advanced electronic signature which guarantees its authenticity, integrity and inalterability.

All the editions of the OJ are available on EUR-Lex, dating back to 1952, when they were available in French, Italian, Dutch and German. They can be easily retrieved via a search or by browsing.

=== EU law ===
EUR-Lex contains all EU law (sectors 3 and 4), which can be retrieved by browsing or using the search options. The main types of acts under this heading are EU treaties (sector 1), directives, regulations, decisions as well as consolidated legislation (sector 0), etc. Consolidation is the integration of a basic legal act and all of its successive amendments and corrigenda into one easy-to-read document. Consolidated texts are intended for use as reference and have no legal value.

Acts which require transposition are published with a list of links to information about the national implementing measures (sector 7).

=== Preparatory documents and lawmaking procedures ===
The database contains also documents preceding legal acts, such as legislative proposals, reports, green and white papers, etc. (sector 5). Some proposals never make it past the preparatory stage, but are still available for consultation.

Each legislative procedure is presented in EUR-Lex with a timeline and a list of events and pertaining documents. Procedures can be accessed via the search or from one of the procedure documents.

=== EU case-law ===
These documents, authored by the Court of Justice of the European Union, form sector 6 and include, inter alia, judgments, orders, rulings and opinions of the Advocates General.

=== Other documents ===
EUR-Lex stores also international agreements (sector 2), parliamentary questions (sector 9), EFTA acts, which include also acts by the EFTA Court and by the EFTA Surveillance Authority (sector E); judgments delivered by courts in contracting states and the EU Court of Justice under the Brussels Regime; references to national case law concerning EU law (sector 8) and other public documents.

== CELEX number and other identifiers ==
=== CELEX number ===
While EU documents are numbered in different ways, each of them is assigned a unique, language independent identifier, a CELEX number.

This identifier is composed of the number of the sector, then 4 digits for the year, then one or two letters for the type of document and finally 2-4 digits for the number of the document. For example, the CELEX number of the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive is 32012L0019 (3 is the sector, legislation; 2012 is the year of publication in the OJ; L represents EU directives and 0019 is the number under which the directives was published in the OJ).

=== ECLI ===
The European Case Law Identifier (ECLI) was introduced by the council, which concluded that for &quot;identification of judicial decisions a standard identifier should be used which is recognisable, readable and understandable by both humans and computers&quot;. Documents can be retrieved using ECLI also on EUR-Lex.

=== ELI ===
EUR-Lex offers also the possibility to retrieve documents by their European Legislation Identifier introduced with Council Conclusions of 10 October 2012 (2012/C 325/02).

== Functionalities ==

=== Search ===

Documents can be retrieved via a search engine (IDOL by HP Autonomy) using various search forms. It is possible to search by document references, dates, text and a multitude of metadata. Registered users have the option of using the expert search and performing searches using Boolean operators.

=== Text display and formats ===
Texts and their metadata can be retrieved, displayed and downloaded in various formats (html, pdf, xml). For work with several language versions, users can use the multilingual display, which is especially useful for translation and linguistics .

=== Saved documents and searches ===
Registered users can save documents and searches in their EUR-Lex account, create search and print profiles, and set their own RSS feeds based on saved searches.

=== Preferences ===

<text>The Mercy Bowl was the name to two one-off charity bowl games played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California. The first was played between Fresno State University and Bowling Green State University on November 23, 1961, as a special fundraiser in memory of sixteen Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo football players killed in a plane crash following a game against Bowling Green a year earlier. The game raised $200,000 for the surviving widows and children and for a memorial in their honor. A second Mercy Bowl was staged in 1971 between CSUF and Fresno State University to benefit the fourteen surviving children of three CSUF assistant coaches and a pilot who died in an airplane crash a month earlier.

<doc id="414755" wikidata="Q332587" url="?curid=414755" title="Des Browne">
<text>Desmond Henry Browne, Baron Browne of Ladyton, (born 22 March 1952) is a Scottish politician who served in the Cabinet of the United Kingdom under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown as Secretary of State for Defence 2006 to 2008 and Secretary of State for Scotland from 2007 to 2008. A member of the Labour Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Kilmarnock and Loudoun from 1997 to 2010.

==Early life and education==
Browne was born in Boglemart, Stevenston, North Ayrshire, lived in Stevenston for the early part of his life, and was educated at the Catholic St Michael&#x27;s Academy in Kilwinning and later at the University of Glasgow, where he received a degree in law.

==Legal career==
He started his legal career in 1974 as an apprentice solicitor with the firm James Campbell &amp; Co. On qualifying in 1976 he became an assistant solicitor with Ross, Harper and Murphy, and was promoted to partner in 1980. He became a partner in McCluskey Browne in 1985, and was a council member of the Law Society of Scotland from 1988 to 1992. He was admitted as an advocate in 1993, practising at the Scottish bar until 1997. He worked mainly in child law.

==Parliamentary career==
Browne contested the parliamentary seat of Argyll and Bute at the 1992 general election, and finished in fourth place behind the sitting Liberal Democrat MP Ray Michie. He was elected to the Faculty of Advocates in 1993. Browne was selected to contest the safe Labour seat of Kilmarnock and Loudoun following the retirement of the sitting MP William McKelvey. Browne won the seat at the 1997 general election with a majority of 7,256. He made his maiden speech on 20 June 1997.

Browne joined the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee on his election, and became the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Secretary of State for Scotland Donald Dewar in 1998. After Dewar left the Cabinet in 1999, to seek election as the First Minister of Scotland, Browne remained in post as PPS to the new Secretary of State John Reid. In 2000 he became the PPS to the Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office.

On 27 November 2009, Browne announced his intention not to seek election in the 2010 general election.

==Government minister==

After the 2001 general election Browne entered Tony Blair&#x27;s government as the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office. He was promoted to Minister of State for Work in 2003, before moving to the Home Office in 2004 as the minister with responsibility for immigration. He joined the Cabinet following the 2005 general election as the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, and became a member of the Privy Council.

Browne was appointed Secretary of State for Defence on 5 May 2006. An advocate of the UK Trident programme, in 2007 he successfully persuaded Parliament to vote to replace Trident. He came under criticism, however, after allowing the Royal Navy personnel captured by Iran in spring 2007 to sell and publish their stories. Under Blair&#x27;s premiership, Browne was considered a supporter of the Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown. He received the additional responsibilities of Secretary of State for Scotland in June 2007 after Brown became prime minister.

In a free parliamentary vote on 20 May 2008, Browne voted for cutting the upper limit for abortions from 24 to 12 weeks, along with two other Catholic cabinet ministers, Ruth Kelly and Paul Murphy. He returned to the backbenches in October 2008 following a cabinet reshuffle.

Browne gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry on 25 January 2010.

He was created a life peer on 22 July 2010, taking the title Baron Browne of Ladyton, &quot;of Ladyton in Ayrshire and Arran&quot;.

He is a Fellow Commoner of St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

==Activities after leaving government==
Browne is vice chairman of the Washington, DC–based Nuclear Threat Initiative, a non-profit, nonpartisan organisation founded in 2001 by former U.S. Senator Sam Nunn, who serves as co-chair and CEO, and CNN founder and philanthropist Ted Turner. NTI&#x27;s mission is to strengthen global security by reducing the risk of use and preventing the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.

Browne is convener of the European Leadership Network for Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament and Non-proliferation. and he is also convenor of the Top Level Group of UK Parliamentarians for Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament and Non-proliferation, established in October 2009.

He is a signatory of Global Zero, a non-profit international initiative for the elimination of all nuclear weapons worldwide.

===Controversy over appointment as envoy to Sri Lanka===
In February 2009, Browne was appointed by PM Brown as the government&#x27;s special envoy to Sri Lanka. However, the government of Mahinda Rajapaksa, fighting the LTTE rebel group, rejected Browne&#x27;s appointment, stating that the British government made the appointment unilaterally, without consultation with the Sri Lankan government.

<text>Angela Frances Browning, Baroness Browning (; born 4 December 1946) is a British Conservative Party politician. She was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Tiverton and Honiton from 1997 to 2010, having previously been MP for Tiverton from 1992 to 1997.

==Early life==
Angela Frances Pearson was born in Reading, Berkshire. Her father was a lab technician at the University of Reading. She was educated at the Westwood Grammar School for Girls (a Grammar School, now called King&#x27;s Academy Prospect) on &quot;Honey End Lane&quot; in Reading, University of West London, and the Bournemouth College of Technology.

She worked in adult education as a Home Economics tutor from 1968 until 1974. She was an auxiliary nurse for a year in 1976, and was appointed as a sales and training manager with GEC Hotpoint in 1977. In 1985, she became a self-employed management consultant, and also became Director of the Small Business Bureau until 1994. From 1988 to 1992, she was the chairman of Women into Business. 

==Political career==
Browning contested Crewe and Nantwich at the 1987 general election, but was narrowly defeated by the veteran Labour MP Gwyneth Dunwoody by just 1,092 votes. She was selected for the safe Conservative seat of Tiverton following the retirement of Robin Maxwell-Hyslop, who had represented the seat for 32 years. She held the seat comfortably at the 1992 general election with a majority of 11,089. She made her maiden speech on 12 June 1992.

Following her election, Browning became a Member of the Agriculture Select committee in 1992. She was appointed the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of State at the Department for Education and Employment Michael Forsyth in 1993. Also in 1993, she became the President of the National Autistic Society. She entered John Major&#x27;s government in 1994 when she became a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, where she remained until the Major government fell. She became a vice president of the National Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease Society in 1997.

Her Tiverton seat was abolished, but she won the nomination for the newly drawn Tiverton and Honiton seat which she contested at the 1997 general election. She won the new seat with a sharply reduced majority of 1,653.

After John Major resigned from the Leadership of the Conservative Party she ran the John Redwood campaign team. She was appointed as an opposition spokeswoman on Education and Employment under William Hague, but she stepped down in 1998 to look after her autistic adult son, Robin. However, Hague brought her back in 1999 when she entered the Shadow cabinet as the Shadow Trade and Industry Secretary, and, in 2000, was the Shadow Leader of the House of Commons. Following the 2001 general election, she was briefly an opposition spokesperson on Constitutional Affairs, before becoming the Vice Chairman of the Conservative Party 2000–04.

In the 2005 general election, Browning increased her majority to 11,051; almost the majority of the original Tiverton seat she took in 1992.

She was a Member of both the Public Accounts and Standards and Privileges Select Committees.

On 17 November 2006, Browning announced her intention not to stand as a candidate at the 2010 general election.

===House of Lords===
On 9 July 2010, she was created a life peer as Baroness Browning, &quot;of Whimple in the County of Devon&quot;, and was introduced in the House of Lords on 13 July 2010, where she sits as a Conservative.

On 11 May 2011, it was announced that Lady Browning would replace James Brokenshire as the Minister for Crime Prevention and Anti-Social Behaviour Reduction in the coalition government following the resignation of Lady Neville-Jones as Security Minister. Lady Browning also became the Home Office Minister of State in the House of Lords, making her the lead for all Home Office business in the Upper House.

She resigned from government on health grounds on 16 September 2011, remaining a member of the House of Lords, and was replaced in the Home Office by Lord Henley.

She was interviewed in 2015 as part of The History of Parliament&#x27;s oral history project.

==Personal life==
She married David Browning on 6 January 1968 in Bournemouth. They have two sons.

<doc id="414765" wikidata="Q137649" url="?curid=414765" title="Isobaric process">
<text>In thermodynamics, an isobaric process is a type of thermodynamic process in which the pressure of the system stays constant: Δ&quot;P&quot; = 0. The heat transferred to the system does work, but also changes the internal energy (&quot;U&quot;) of the system. This article uses the physics sign convention for work, where positive work is work done by the system. Using this convention, by the first law of thermodynamics,

:formula_1

where &quot;W&quot; is work, &quot;U&quot; is internal energy, and &quot;Q&quot; is heat. Pressure-volume work by the closed system is defined as:

:formula_2

where Δ means change over the whole process, whereas &quot;d&quot; denotes a differential. Since pressure is constant, this means that

:formula_3.

Applying the ideal gas law, this becomes

:formula_4

with &quot;R&quot; representing the gas constant, and &quot;n&quot; representing the amount of substance, which is assumed to remain constant (e.g., there is no phase transition during a chemical reaction). According to the equipartition theorem, the change in internal energy is related to the temperature of the system by

:formula_5,

where &quot;cV, m&quot; is molar heat capacity at a constant volume.

Substituting the last two equations into the first equation produces:

:formula_6
where &quot;cP&quot; is molar heat capacity at a constant pressure.

==Specific heat capacity==
To find the molar specific heat capacity of the gas involved, the following equations apply for any general gas that is calorically perfect. The property &quot;γ&quot; is either called the adiabatic index or the heat capacity ratio. Some published sources might use &quot;k&quot; instead of &quot;γ&quot;.

Molar isochoric specific heat:
:formula_7.

Molar isobaric specific heat:
:formula_8.
The values for &quot;γ&quot; are &quot;γ&quot; =  for diatomic gases like air and its major components, and &quot;γ&quot; =  for monatomic gases like the noble gases. The formulas for specific heats would reduce in these special cases:

Monatomic:
:formula_9 and formula_10

Diatomic:
:formula_11 and formula_12

An isobaric process is shown on a &quot;P&quot;–&quot;V&quot; diagram as a straight horizontal line, connecting the initial and final thermostatic states. If the process moves towards the right, then it is an expansion. If the process moves towards the left, then it is a compression.

==Sign convention for work==
The motivation for the specific sign conventions of thermodynamics comes from early development of heat engines. When designing a heat engine, the goal is to have the system produce and deliver work output. The source of energy in a heat engine, is a heat input.

* If the volume compresses (Δ&quot;V&quot; = final volume − initial volume &lt; 0), then &quot;W&quot; &lt; 0. That is, during isobaric compression the gas does negative work, or the environment does positive work. Restated, the environment does positive work on the gas.
* If the volume expands (Δ&quot;V&quot; = final volume − initial volume &gt; 0), then &quot;W&quot; &gt; 0. That is, during isobaric expansion the gas does positive work, or equivalently, the environment does negative work. Restated, the gas does positive work on the environment.
* If heat is added to the system, then &quot;Q&quot; &gt; 0. That is, during isobaric expansion/heating, positive heat is added to the gas, or equivalently, the environment receives negative heat. Restated, the gas receives positive heat from the environment.
* If the system rejects heat, then &quot;Q&quot; &lt; 0. That is, during isobaric compression/cooling, negative heat is added to the gas, or equivalently, the environment receives positive heat. Restated, the environment receives positive heat from the gas.

==Defining enthalpy==
An isochoric process is described by the equation &quot;Q&quot; = Δ&quot;U&quot;. It would be convenient to have a similar equation for isobaric processes. Substituting the second equation into the first yields

:formula_13

The quantity &quot;U&quot; + &quot;pV&quot; is a state function so that it can be given a name. It is called enthalpy, and is denoted as &quot;H&quot;. Therefore, an isobaric process can be more succinctly described as

:formula_14.

Enthalpy and isochoric specific heat capacity are very useful mathematical constructs, since when analyzing a process in an open system, the situation of zero work occurs when the fluid flows at constant pressure. In an open system, enthalpy is the quantity which is useful to use to keep track of energy content of the fluid.

== Examples of isobaric processes ==
The reversible expansion of an ideal gas can be used as an example of an isobaric process. Of particular interest is the way heat is converted to work when expansion is carried out at different working gas/surrounding gas pressures.

In the first process example, a cylindrical chamber 1 m2 in area encloses 81.2438 mol of an ideal diatomic gas of molecular mass 29 g mol−1 at 300 K. The surrounding gas is at 1 atm and 300 K, and separated from the cylinder gas by a thin piston. For the limiting case of a massless piston, the cylinder gas is also at 1 atm pressure, with an initial volume of 2 m3. Heat is added slowly until the gas temperature is uniformly 600 K, after which the gas volume is 4 m3 and the piston is 2 m above its initial position. If the piston motion is sufficiently slow, the gas pressure at each instant will have practically the same value (&quot;p&quot;sys = 1 atm) throughout.

For a thermally perfect diatomic gas, the molar specific heat capacity at constant pressure (&quot;cp&quot;) is 7/2R or 29.1006 J mol−1 deg−1. The molar heat capacity at constant volume (&quot;cv&quot;) is 5/2R or 20.7862 J mol−1 deg−1. The ratio formula_15 of the two heat capacities is 1.4.

The heat &quot;Q&quot; required to bring the gas from 300 to 600 K is

:formula_16.

The increase in internal energy is

:formula_17

Therefore, formula_18

Also

formula_19, which of course is identical to the difference between Δ&quot;H&quot; and Δ&quot;U&quot;.

Here, work is entirely consumed by expansion against the surroundings. Of the total heat applied (709.3 kJ), the work performed (202.7 kJ) is about 28.6% of the supplied heat.
The second process example is similar to the first, except that the massless piston is replaced by one having a mass of 10,332.2 kg, which doubles the pressure of the cylinder gas to 2 atm. The cylinder gas volume is then 1 m3 at the initial 300 K temperature. Heat is added slowly until the gas temperature is uniformly 600 K, after which the gas volume is 2 m3 and the piston is 1 m above its initial position. If the piston motion is sufficiently slow, the gas pressure at each instant will have practically the same value (&quot;p&quot;sys = 2 atm) throughout.

Since enthalpy and internal energy are independent of pressure,

: formula_20 and formula_21.
:formula_22

As in the first example, about 28.6% of the supplied heat is converted to work. But here, work is applied in two different ways: partly by expanding the surrounding atmosphere and partly by lifting 10,332.2 kg a distance &quot;h&quot; of 1 m.

:formula_23

Thus, half the work lifts the piston mass (work of gravity, or “useable” work), while the other half expands the surroundings.

The results of these two process examples illustrate the difference between the fraction of heat converted to usable work (&quot;mg&quot;Δ&quot;h)&quot; vs. the fraction converted to pressure-volume work done against the surrounding atmosphere. The usable work approaches zero as the working gas pressure approaches that of the surroundings, while maximum usable work is obtained when there is no surrounding gas pressure. The ratio of all work performed to the heat input for ideal isobaric gas expansion is

:formula_24

==Variable density viewpoint==
A given quantity (mass &quot;m&quot;) of gas in a changing volume produces a change in density &quot;ρ&quot;. In this context the ideal gas law is written

:formula_25

where &quot;T&quot; is thermodynamic temperature and &quot;M&quot; is molar mass. When R and M are taken as constant, then pressure &quot;P&quot; can stay constant as the density-temperature quadrant undergoes a squeeze mapping.

==Etymology==
The adjective &quot;isobaric&quot; is derived from the Greek words ἴσος (&quot;isos&quot;) meaning &quot;equal&quot;, and βάρος (&quot;baros&quot;) meaning &quot;weight.&quot;

<text>The New Zealand storm petrel (Fregetta maoriana) is a small seabird of the family Oceanitidae endemic to New Zealand. Thought to be extinct since 1850, a series of sightings from 2003 to the present indicated the presence of a previously unknown colony. The population of New Zealand storm petrels has been estimated to be less than 2000.

==Description==
The New Zealand storm petrel is a small seabird, dark brown/black above, except for its white rump. The underparts are black from the throat to the breast, with a white belly that has black streaking, and the feet project well beyond the tail. This storm petrel is strictly nocturnal at the breeding sites to avoid predation by larger and more aggressive gulls and skuas. Like most petrels, its walking ability is limited to a short shuffle to the burrow. It differs from the more common petrel species found in New Zealand, Wilson&#x27;s storm petrel (&quot;O. oceanicus&quot;), by its pale bar on the upper wing, white belly with streaking, narrow white panel on the underwings, longer legs, and dark webs to the feet. Outside the breeding season, it is pelagic, remaining at sea, and this, together with its remote breeding sites, makes it a difficult bird to observe.

==Taxonomy==
The specific epithet honours the Māori, the native people of New Zealand. The New Zealand storm petrel has on occasion been considered a subspecies or even variant of Wilson&#x27;s storm petrel, but is quite distinct. In 2011, DNA samples from museum specimens in England and France matched those of birds in the Hauraki Gulf. The study also suggested the species is probably more closely related to storm petrels in the genus &quot;Fregetta&quot; than &quot;Oceanites&quot;.

==Rediscovery==

It had been believed to be extinct, but on 25 January 2003, a possible sighting was made by Sav Saville, Brent Stephenson, and others close to the Mercury Islands off the Coromandel Peninsula of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island, leading to several inconclusive photographs and an article being published. On 17 November 2003, while looking for black-bellied storm petrels and white-faced storm petrels, Bob Flood and Bryan Thomas obtained good photographs and video of 10 to 20 New Zealand storm petrels off Great Barrier and Little Barrier Islands in the Hauraki Gulf. Subsequently, four storm petrels were captured and released in a similar area in late 2005/early 2006, three with radio transmitters attached. Tour operators have also regularly seen these birds on the Hauraki Gulf since this time.

The tagged birds were initially only tracked at sea; efforts to find the birds&#x27; breeding location were unsuccessful until 2013, when a breeding site on Little Barrier Island was found. A team of researchers from Auckland University led by Chris Gaskin and Matt Rayner discovered the breeding site in the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park in February 2013. Researchers will continue observing the birds from a distance to prevent disturbing the breeding cycle. They hope to establish the distribution and population of the remaining New Zealand storm petrels.
In February 2014, an egg of the New Zealand storm petrel on Little Barrier Island was first discovered. It measured 31 mm by 23 mm and was coloured white with a fine dusting of pink spots concentrated at one end.

<doc id="414769" wikidata="Q1109804" url="?curid=414769" title="Societas cooperativa Europaea">
<text>The European Cooperative Society (SCE, for Latin ) is, in corporate law, a European cooperative type of company, established in 2006 and related to the (SE). They may be established and may operate throughout the European Economic Area (EEA, including the European Union). The legal form was created to remove the need for cooperatives to establish a subsidiary in each member state of the European Union in which they operate, and to allow them to move their registered office and headquarters freely from one member state to another, keeping their legal identity and without having to register or wind up any legal persons. No matter where they are established, SCEs are governed by a single EEA-wide set of rules and principles which are supplemented by the laws on co-operatives in each member state, and other areas of law.

==History==

===Early attempts===
===Legislative history===
===SCEs in practice===
In 2015, the German meat marketer changed its legal form to a Societas cooperativa Europaea. In 2018, OurPower, the first European cooperative based in Austria, was founded.

==Formation==
Article 2(1) of the SCE Regulation provides for SCEs to be formed in five ways:

*&quot;ex novo&quot;: by five or more natural persons resident in at least two member states
*by a merger between at least two EEA co-operatives governed by the law of at least two different member states;
*by at least five natural and legal persons resident in, or governed by the law of, at least two member states;
*by conversion of a single EEA co-operative, if it has had an establishment or subsidiary in a different member state for at least two years.
*by two or more legal persons governed by the law of at least two member states;

==Characteristics==
===Membership===
The creation of a cooperative: by 5 or more persons residing in different Member States or by legal entities established in different Member States.

===Capital===
The issued capital shall not be less than EUR 30,000.

Shares issued shall be paid for on the day of the subscription to not less than 25% of their nominal value. The balance shall be paid within five years unless the statutes provide for a shorter period.

===Principles===
==Governing law==
The SCE legal form is a creature of European Union law.

The two specific pieces of EU legislation providing the legal basis for the SCE legal form – which apply throughout the European Economic Area – are:
* Council Regulation (EC) No 1435/2003 of 22 July 2003 on the Statute for a European Cooperative Society (SCE) which established the SCE legal form;
* Council Directive 2003/72/EC of 22 July 2003 supplementing the Statute for a European Cooperative Society with regard to the involvement of employees which sets out rules about representation and involvement of employees in European Cooperative Societies.

Both of them were passed into law on 22 July 2003, and the regulation, which established the SCE legal form, began to apply from 18 August 2006. Thus, subject to the necessary national laws being passed, SCEs could be created in member states from 18 August 2006.

The SCE Regulation is currently under review in accordance with its article 79. This process started more than three years ago and, among other things, involved an in-depth study, two public consultations, three conferences, and a report from the EC.

The European Commission has recently announced that it does not plan to revise the SCE Regulation (as well as the SE Regulation) in the short term.

<text>The GIUK gap (sometimes written G-I-UK) is an area in the northern Atlantic Ocean that forms a naval choke point. Its name is an acronym for &quot;Greenland, Iceland&quot;, and the &quot;United Kingdom&quot;, the gap being the two stretches of open ocean among these three landmasses. It separates the Norwegian Sea and the North Sea from the open Atlantic Ocean. The term is typically used in relation to military topics. The area has for some nations been considered strategically important since the beginning of the 20th century.

== Strategic significance to the Kingdom of Denmark ==
Comprising Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Denmark, the Kingdom of Denmark is an Arctic state alongside seven other countries whose territories cover the Arctic region. All matters of foreign policy for both Greenland and the Faroe Islands fall within the jurisdiction of the Danish government.

The Danish government has historically used its jurisdiction over foreign policy in both Greenland and the Faroe Islands to assist in securing the GIUK gap and the wider Arctic for its allies. In doing so, Denmark has arguably acquired a sense of goodwill from particularly the US government and NATO. The Danish government views the Arctic as a central component of its foreign security policy and will continue to expand its spending, surveillance and military presence in the region.

Despite the relatively small-sized population of the Kingdom of Denmark, roughly 6 million, the Danish government&#x27;s close ties to Greenland and the Faroe Islands legitimises it as an inherently important Arctic actor on matters of geopolitical security and great-power tensions. Danish assertion of sovereignty in the GIUK gap and the wider Arctic is already a key concern to the Realm and is expected to be an increasingly important component of Denmark&#x27;s future responsibilities in NATO.

The GIUK gap is also a key supply line between the US and its European allies. With war on-going in Ukraine, NATO and the US are showing renewed interest in the GIUK gap, positioning Denmark to be a key player in matters of broader European security and increasing the gap&#x27;s strategic importance to the Danish Realm.

=== Securing air and sea visibility in the GIUK Gap ===
Until 2007, the Faroe Islands were home to an air surveillance radar station, providing vital radar coverage during the Cold War. In light of broader geopolitical changes, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 2022, the station was undergoing preparations to be reopened, closing an important surveillance gap in the GIUK gap.

Maintaining thorough surveillance of the GIUK gap is crucial in order to ensure that sea lines of communication (SLOCs) and supply lines are uninterrupted between NATO&#x27;s European members and the United States. Military bases, space bases, surveillance drones and radar installations in both Greenland and the Faroe Islands can help ensure proper visibility in the region, and assist in anti-submarine warfare (ASW) in case of actual conflict. In 2021, Denmark unveiled a $250m investment in surveillance capabilities in Greenland and the Faroe Islands.

Responding to requests from NATO for Denmark to play its part in securing Arctic waters, Denmark is taking further steps to equip its ASW-frigates with sonar equipment, making them better equipped to detect and track submarines in the Arctic Ocean, and particularly in the GIUK gap. In addition, the Danish government is equipping its Seahawk helicopters with sonar equipment and torpedoes. The upgrades have yet to be delivered, however, with delivery projections estimating 2024 at the earliest.

=== Threats to critical seabed infrastructure ===
During the Cold War, Russia relied on the ability of its nuclear submarines to pass through the GIUK gap in order to ensure maximum military capability. The introduction of long-range precision strike weapons, however, have reduced the significance of the GIUK gap in relation to intercontinental attacks and made it possible for Russia to target North American sites from safer waters, such as the Norwegian Sea. Still, the GIUK gap remains the obvious access point for Russian military operations in the wider North Atlantic Ocean since most of Russia&#x27;s highest quality naval capabilities are deployed in the Northern fleet, making the GIUK gap a significant transit route.

For NATO allies, the GIUK gap is vital in terms of barrier defense for sea lines of communication protection. SLOCs are vulnerable in the North Atlantic both in the gap and beyond, and the US and NATO rely on the Kingdom of Denmark to assist in protecting this critical infrastructure, including the vast number of seabed data cables.

The Russian fleet has in recent years strategically upgraded its capabilities for covert subsea operations related to the targeting of seabed infrastructure and reports of Russian &quot;mapping&quot; of critical seabed infrastructure in the North Sea and the seabed around Denmark are increasing. NATO intelligence and security officials confirm these reports, warning that Russia has both the intent and necessary capabilities to target critical seabed installations if they so choose. While such infrastructure has always been associated with some risk, the dependency of Denmark and its allies on them are only increasing and is therefore posing a major threat in times of tension short of actual conflict.

The September 2022 Nord Stream pipeline sabotage in the Baltic Sea proves the fragility of seabed infrastructure and underscore the need for the Danish government to maintain a strong Arctic responsibility in the GIUK gap.

==Importance for the Royal Navy==

The GIUK gap is particularly important to the UK&#x27;s Royal Navy, as any attempt by northern European forces to break into the open Atlantic would have to be made either through the heavily defended English Channel, one of the world&#x27;s busiest seaways, or through one of the exits on either side of Iceland. As the British also control the strategic port of Gibraltar at the entrance to the Mediterranean, this means Spain, France, and Portugal are the only Continental European countries that possess direct access to the Atlantic Ocean that cannot easily be blocked at a choke point by the Royal Navy.

==History==
Since the beginning of the 20th century, the exploitation of the GIUK gap by northern forces and measures to patrol and secure the gap by opposing forces have played an important role in naval and in overall military planning.

===World War II===
From the start of World War II in 1939, German ships used the gap to break out from their bases in northern Germany (and from occupied Norway after April 1940) with a view to attacking Allied shipping convoys, but Allied blocking efforts in the North Sea and in the GIUK gap impeded such break-outs. British forces occupied the Faroe Islands in April 1940, and Iceland in May 1940; the United States took over effective control of Greenland in 1940. But the German profited greatly from the fall of France in June 1940, after which German submarines could operate from bases on the French coast.

The origin of the term &quot;gap&quot; dates to this period, when there was a gap in air coverage known as the Mid-Atlantic gap or the &quot;Greenland air gap&quot;. This gap was an area that land-based aircraft could not reach and where, as a result, they could not carry out their anti-submarine duties.

===Cold War===
The GIUK gap again became the focus of naval planning in the 1950s, as it represented the only available outlet into the Atlantic Ocean for Soviet submarines operating from their bases on the Kola Peninsula. NATO worried that if the Cold War &quot;turned hot&quot;, naval convoys reinforcing Europe from the U.S. would suffer unacceptable losses if Soviet submarines could operate in the North Atlantic. The United States and Britain based much of their post-war naval strategy on blocking the gap, installing a chain of underwater listening posts right across it during the 1950s – an example of a SOSUS &quot;sound surveillance system&quot;. This deployment of sonar surveillance in the gap, and elsewhere, hampered the Soviet Northern Fleet&#x27;s ability to deploy its submarines without detection.

The Royal Navy&#x27;s primary mission during the Cold War, excluding its nuclear deterrent role, involved anti-submarine warfare (ASW). The development of the ASW aircraft carriers stemmed from this doctrine: their primary mission involved anti-submarine warfare using Sea King helicopters. The Type 23 frigate originated as a pure ASW platform; its mission expanded following the Falklands War of 1982.

The largest Russian submarine drills through the GIUK gap were operations Aport and Atrina, in 1985 and 1987, respectively, when the Soviets deployed several SSNs near the U.S. coast before the 1985 Gorbachev–Reagan meeting.

The Soviets planned to use the GIUK gap to intercept any NATO ships, especially aircraft carriers, heading towards the Soviet Union. Ships and submarines as well as Tupolev Tu-142 maritime-surveillance aircraft aimed to track any threatening ships.

The advent of longer-ranged Soviet submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) allowed the Soviet Navy to deploy their ballistic missile submarine (SSBNs) within protected bastions in the Barents Sea and reduced their need to transit the GIUK gap. The much reduced, post-Cold War Russian Navy has even less need to transit the GIUK gap.

Crossing the GIUK gap was a major strategic move for Ocean Venture in 1992, in which 84 NATO ships, including 4 US aircraft carriers, departed from their usual August exercise pattern, deployed a decoy south toward the mid-Atlantic, and then entered waters in a move that had historically been associated with a risk of destabilizing détente.

===Post-Cold War===
In late October 2019, a week before Commander of the Northern Fleet Aleksandr Moiseyev and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met their Norwegian counterparts in Kirkenes, Norway, ten submarines of Russia&#x27;s Northern Fleet, among them two diesel-electric and eight non-strategic nuclear, left their homebases in the Kola Peninsula to participate in submarine drills that were the largest, on the Russian side, since Cold War operations Aport and Atrina.
The main task of the submarines was reportedly testing Russian ability to breach the GIUK gap undetected and sail into the Atlantic Ocean. The drills were expected to last up to two months.

==Bird migration==
The GIUK gap is also a route for migratory birds such as the northern wheatear to cross the Atlantic to reach Greenland and eastern Canada.

==In popular culture==
* The 1960 British war film &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; discusses the strategic importance of the GIUK gap during World War II naval operations in the Atlantic theatre, and depicts the Battle of the Denmark Strait between British and German forces. It is based on the novel &quot;The Last Nine Days of the Bismarck&quot; by C. S. Forester.
* The GIUK line is mentioned in the film &quot;The Bedford Incident&quot;. 
* In Tom Clancy&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, the line was used to detect Soviet submarines entering the North Atlantic in pursuit of the rogue Typhoon-class submarine &quot;Red October&quot;, whose officers were defecting to the United States with clandestine stealth technology. The event causes significant political and military tension between the United States and the Soviet Union. The film adaptation also references the gap, with National Security Advisor Jeffrey Pelt (played by Richard Jordan) saying to the Soviet ambassador &quot;Your aircraft have dropped enough sonar buoys so that a man could walk from Greenland to Iceland to Scotland without getting his feet wet.&quot;
* In Clancy&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;, the line is featured more prominently after a war breaks out between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The Soviet Union launches a surprise attack on the NATO airbase NAS Keflavik and invades Iceland. This causes the line to be destroyed, creating a gap in NATO&#x27;s surveillance and allowing the Soviet Navy to enter the North Atlantic. The subsequent Soviet submarine attacks and air raids cause serious damage to Merchant Marine ships and naval vessels in Atlantic convoys, hindering NATO&#x27;s war effort during the defense against the less-successful Soviet invasion of West Germany.
* Early editions of the &quot;Harpoon&quot; naval warfare simulation were based around defending the GIUK Gap. Tom Clancy used the simulation to test the naval battles for &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;.
* The location of Iceland in the gap made it a participant in the Cold War and a target for a nuclear strike, especially through the introduction of the aforementioned Keflavik atomic bomber NATO base. Halldór Laxness dramatized the tension of these geopolitics from the perspective of an Icelandic maid in the novel &quot;The Atom Station&quot;.

<text>Malcolm Gray Bruce, Baron Bruce of Bennachie, (born 17 November 1944) is a British Liberal Democrat politician.
He was the Member of Parliament for Gordon from 1983 to 2015 and was the chairman of the International Development Select Committee from 2005 to 2015.
He was deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats from 28 January 2014. He was nominated for a life peerage in the 2015 Dissolution Honours. He was also previously President of the Scottish Liberal Democrats until being succeeded by Councillor Eileen McCartin from 1 January 2016.

==Early life==
Bruce was born in Birkenhead, and educated at Wrekin College in Shropshire, England, prior to attending Queen&#x27;s College (now the University of Dundee) at the University of St Andrews, where he received a degree in economics and political science, and Strathclyde University where he received a second degree in marketing. He was a trainee journalist with the &quot;Liverpool Post&quot; for a year from 1966 prior to him becoming a section buyer with the Boots Group in 1967. After a brief spell with A. Goldberg &amp; Son, he was appointed in 1971 as a research and information officer with the North East Scotland Development Agency. He contested the Parliamentary seat of North Angus and Mearns for the Liberal Party at the October 1974 general election, but the sitting Conservative and Unionist MP Alick Buchanan-Smith won with a majority of 2,551.

==Career==
Bruce was elected as the Vice-Chairman of the Scottish Liberal Party in 1975, in the same year he became a director with the Noroil Publishing House. He again stood for Parliament at the 1979 general election for the seat of West Aberdeenshire and was again defeated by the sitting Conservative and Unionist MP, this time Russell Fairgrieve by 2,766 votes. Bruce became the editor of the &quot;Aberdeen Petroleum Press&quot; in 1981 until his election as MP for Gordon in 1983.

He was called to the bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1995.

==Member of Parliament==
Bruce stood for parliament for a third time at the newly created seat of Gordon, based largely on the former Aberdeenshire West. Fairgrieve retired, and at the 1983 general election he was very narrowly elected and became the Liberal MP for Gordon with a majority of just 850, and held the seat for thirty-two years. He was an outspoken opponent of coalition with the Labour Party.

When he was elected to parliament, Bruce served on the Scottish Affairs Select committee, and in 1986 was given a job by David Steel as a Spokesman on Energy and Scotland. He also became Rector of the University of Dundee in 1986 for three years. After the 1987 general election, at which Bruce&#x27;s majority had increased to 9,519, he was briefly a spokesman on Education, before speaking on Trade and Industry later in 1987. After the amalgamation of the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party and the formation of the Liberal Democrats he became the new party&#x27;s Energy spokesman and at the same time became the Leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats under the new leadership of Paddy Ashdown. In 1989 he was appointed as the Environment spokesman, before having the Scotland portfolio after 1990.

After the 1992 general election, at which he narrowly held Gordon by just 274 votes, he again became the Trade and Industry spokesman. By 1994 he had become the Treasury spokesman. Whilst a Treasury spokesman it was Bruce who developed the idea of a &#x27;penny on income tax&#x27;. At the 1997 general election Bruce&#x27;s majority had risen again to 6,997. The Liberal Democrats had 46 MPs, more than they have had since before the 1920s. Paddy Ashdown created a new Shadow Cabinet system and Bruce became the Liberal Democrat Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer. When Ashdown stood down in 1999 he contested the leadership of the party but came in third place. In 1999, under the new leadership of Charles Kennedy, became the Chairman of the Liberal Democrats until 2001, and 2000 - 2015 was the president of the Scottish Liberal Democrats.

Bruce won Gordon for the fifth consecutive time at the 2001 general election with a still rising majority of 7,879. Following his re-election, Bruce became the Liberal Democrat Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and the Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in 2003. He stood down from the frontbench following the 2005 general election, where he was re-elected with his highest majority yet at 11,026. He was Chairman of the International Development Select Committee from 2005 to 2015, scrutinising the work of the Department of International Development.

He was made a Member of the Privy Council on 19 July 2006.

He was knighted in the 2012 Birthday Honours for public and political service.

On 2 September 2013 he announced that he would not seek re-election as an MP at the 2015 General Election. He was announced as a life peer in the 2015 Dissolution Honours and was created Baron Bruce of Bennachie, &quot;of Torphins in the County of Aberdeen&quot; on 19 October.

==Personal life==
He married Veronica Jane Wilson in 1969 and they have a son and a daughter, before divorcing in 1992. Bruce married secondly, in 1998, Rosemary Vetterlein, a Lib Dem activist and prospective parliamentary candidate who contested Beckenham unsuccessfully in 1997.

Lord and Lady Bruce have two daughters and a son together. Bruce takes a keen interest in deaf issues; one of his children is deaf.

<text>Dame Karen Patricia Buck (born 30 August 1958) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Westminster North, previously Regent&#x27;s Park and Kensington North, from 1997 to 2024. She served on Westminster City Council from 1990 to 1997.

==Early life==
Born in Castlederg, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, Buck was educated at the Chelmsford County High School for Girls and the London School of Economics, from where she was awarded a BSc and an MSc in Economics, and an MA in Social Policy and Administration. Buck was briefly a Young Liberal.

She joined the Labour Party in 1978. The following year, she became a research and development worker with Outset, a charity working with disabled people, before joining Hackney London Borough Council in 1983, initially working for them as a senior disability officer, and from 1986 as a public health officer.

Buck first ran for election in 1982, aged 23, as one of the three unsuccessful Labour candidates in Barnet&#x27;s Mill Hill ward. In 1986 she stood in Westminster City Council&#x27;s Cavendish ward, an area straddling Marylebone and the West End of London. Despite the large increase in the Labour vote, all three seats were narrowly retained by the Conservatives, in a tightly contested election which saw Labour come close to winning the council.

She began working for the Labour Party in 1987 as a health directorate researcher, becoming a campaign strategy coordinator in 1992. She was elected to Westminster City Council in 1990, representing Queen&#x27;s Park ward (situated around the area of that name) in a safe seat for her party. Buck remained on the council until shortly after her election to parliament in 1997, when she stood down. Whilst a councillor, she was involved in exposing the fraudulent behaviour of council leader Shirley Porter and the homes for votes scandal.

==Parliamentary career==
Buck was selected to stand for election for Labour through an all-women shortlist, in a seat which was based largely on the former Westminster North constituency, held narrowly at the 1992 general election by the former Conservative minister John Wheeler. He retired, and Buck was elected at the 1997 general election as the Labour MP for Regent&#x27;s Park and Kensington North with a majority of 14,657 on a night which saw a historic Labour landslide win. She made her maiden speech on 17 June 1997, and would serve continuously as an MP for 27 years. In a 2005 profile, she was described as &quot;A bright and humorous centre-left feminist&quot; who &quot;has the perfect New Labour pedigree.&quot;

Following her election to Parliament, Buck joined the Social Security Select committee, and after the 2001 general election she joined the Work and Pensions Select Committee. In 2001, her appointment as an Assistant Government Whip was announced without her knowledge and consent. She declined to take up the post. However, she did become a member of Prime Minister Tony Blair&#x27;s government in the wake of the 2005 general election, as the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Transport.

At the 2010 general election she was elected as the MP for the newly recreated marginal seat of Westminster North, with a majority of 2,126 over Joanne Cash, the Conservative candidate, in a high-profile race.

Following Labour&#x27;s election defeat, Buck nominated Ed Miliband in the party&#x27;s 2010 leadership contest. During Miliband&#x27;s tenure as Labour Leader, Buck served as Shadow Minister for Welfare Reform from 2010 to 2011 and Further Education from 2011 to 2013. She was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to Miliband, alongside Wayne David, in 2013. Buck joined the Work and Pensions Committee following her re-election and Miliband&#x27;s resignation in 2015.

Following Labour&#x27;s defeat at the 2015 election, which saw Buck re-elected with a slightly decreased majority, Miliband resigned as leader. Buck nominated Yvette Cooper in the resulting leadership election. Cooper came third, with Jeremy Corbyn becoming party leader; Buck did not serve in any posts during his leadership. In the 2016 Labour leadership election, when Corbyn was challenged by Owen Smith, Buck nominated Smith. At the 2017 general election, Buck increased her majority by 14.7%, from 1,977 (5.0%) to 11,512 (26.6%), representing a 10.8% swing to Labour in the constituency.

In December 2018, Buck&#x27;s Private Member&#x27;s Bill received Royal Assent as the Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act, coming into force on 20 March 2019. If a landlord failed to let and maintain a property that was fit for human habitation, the Bill would give tenants the right to take action in the courts. The Bill received cross-party support. She was re-elected in 2019, with a small swing away from Labour, again with a substantial majority of 10,759 (25.07%), suggesting that Westminster North had become a safe seat. Nationally, Labour were defeated for the fourth time in a row, and a leadership election was held in 2020 to replace Corbyn. Buck nominated Keir Starmer, who won, and consequently became party leader. She was appointed Shadow Minister for Social Security in July 2020, serving in the role until she stepped down in September 2023.

In January 2024, Buck announced that she would be standing down at the next general election. She was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2024 Birthday Honours.

==Views==
Buck expressed concerns in 2018 that homeless Londoners were forced to move out of the city, stating: &quot;Losing your home is a deeply traumatic event and then being offered accommodation miles away from your community, your work, your children&#x27;s school and your care responsibilities compounds all that trauma. People are struggling against the most appalling odds to hold their own lives together and above all to hold their kids&#x27; lives together.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian29/10/2018&quot;&gt;Number of homeless households moved out of London soars &quot;The Guardian&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

She voted in favour of the hunting ban and gay marriage, whilst in 2007, she voted against replacing Trident. Buck was previously a member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Whilst an MP, she was a member of Greenpeace and Amnesty International.

Buck was formerly a member of two white-collar public service trade unions, the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs (ASTMS) and the National and Local Government Officers&#x27; Association (NALGO). Before it merged with Amicus, she was a member of the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union (TGWU).

==Personal life==
Buck is a Roman Catholic. In 2000, she married Barrie Taylor, with whom she had a son. Buck and Taylor served alongside each other on Westminster City Council, with both representing Queen&#x27;s Park from 1994 to 1997. Taylor died in 2024.

== In popular culture ==
In the 1999 novel &quot;Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason&quot;, the protagonist, Bridget Jones, is asked by her friend Tom which candidate she will be voting for on the day of the 1997 general election. Jones looks for a red (Labour) sign on a lamppost and responds, &quot;Buck!&quot; In the novel, Jones is a resident of Notting Hill, an area which was part of Buck&#x27;s original constituency, Regent&#x27;s Park and Kensington North. However, Jones is unable to vote, since she is not registered, and she subsequently worries about the effect this could have on the election result: &quot;What if Buck loses by one vote then entire election lost by one seat? Will be my fault, my fault.&quot;
