<text>SMS (&quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Ship &quot;) was a German light cruiser built for the (Imperial Navy). The lead ship of her class, she was laid down at the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg in 1906, launched in October 1907, and completed in November 1908. Her entrance into service was delayed by accidents during sea trials, including a collision with another vessel which necessitated major repairs. Like the preceding cruisers upon which her design was based, was armed with ten SK L/40 guns and two torpedo tubes.

 spent much of her career overseas. After commissioning, she visited the United States in 1909 during the Hudson–Fulton Celebration, before returning to Germany to serve in the reconnaissance force of the High Seas Fleet for three years. In 1913, she was assigned to the Mediterranean Division. She was then sent to the Caribbean to protect German nationals during the Mexican Revolution. In mid-1914, she carried the former dictator Victoriano Huerta to Jamaica, where the British had granted him asylum. She was due to return to Germany in July 1914, but was prevented from doing so by the outbreak of World War I. At the onset of hostilities, operated as a commerce raider in South American waters in the Atlantic, then moved to the Pacific Ocean in September and joined Maximilian von Spee&#x27;s East Asia Squadron.

 saw action in the Battle of Coronel in November, where she engaged the British cruiser , and at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December, where she was the only German warship to escape destruction. She eluded her British pursuers for several more months, until she put into Robinson Crusoe Island in March 1915. Her engines were worn out and she had almost no coal left for her boilers, so the ship&#x27;s captain contacted the local Chilean authorities to have interned. She was trapped by British cruisers, including her old opponent &quot;Glasgow&quot;. The British violated Chilean neutrality and opened fire on the ship in the Battle of Más a Tierra. The Germans scuttled and the majority of the crew escaped to be interned in Chile for the duration of the war. The wreck remains in the harbor; several artifacts, including her bell and compass, have been returned to Germany.

==Design==

The 1898 Naval Law authorized the construction of thirty new light cruisers; the program began with the , which was developed into the and es, both of which incorporated incremental improvements over the course of construction. The primary alteration for the two -class cruisers, assigned to the 1906 fiscal year, consisted of an additional boiler for the propulsion system to increase engine power.

 was long overall with a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship had a minimal superstructure, which consisted of a small conning tower and bridge structure. Her hull had a raised forecastle and quarterdeck, along with a pronounced ram bow. She was fitted with two pole masts. She had a crew of 18 officers and 343 enlisted men.

Her propulsion system consisted of two Parsons steam turbines, which drove a pair of screw propellers. Steam was provided by twelve coal-fired water-tube boilers that were vented through three funnels. The propulsion system was designed to give for a top speed of . carried up to of coal, which gave her a range of at .

The ship was armed with a main battery of ten SK L/40 guns in single pivot mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle; six were located on the broadside, three on either side; and two were placed side by side aft. The guns could engage targets out to . They were supplied with 1,500 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun. The secondary battery comprised eight SK L/55 guns, with 4,000 rounds of ammunition. She was also equipped with two torpedo tubes with four torpedoes, mounted on the deck.

The ship was protected by a curved armored deck that was up to thick. It sloped downward at the sides of the hull to provide defense against incoming fire; the sloped portion was thick. The conning tower had thick sides, and the guns were protected by thick gun shields.

==Service history==

 was ordered under the contract name . She was laid down at the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg in 1906 and launched on 5 October 1907. The of her namesake city, Otto Beutler, christened the ship. Fitting-out work then commenced, and was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 14 November 1908. Following her commissioning, began her sea trials. On 28 November she accidentally collided with and sank the Swedish galeas outside Kiel. ″s starboard propeller shaft was shoved in , and she required six months of repair work. She resumed sea trials in 1909, but a turbine accident necessitated further repairs, which lasted until September.

Although had not completed the required testing, her trials were declared over on 7 September, as she had been ordered to visit the United States. The purpose of the voyage was to represent Germany at the Hudson–Fulton Celebration in New York; was joined by the protected cruisers and and the light cruiser . left Wilhelmshaven on 11 September and stopped in Newport, where she met the rest of the ships of the squadron. The ships arrived in New York on 24 September, remained there until 9 October, and arrived back in Germany on 22 October.

 then joined the reconnaissance force for the High Seas Fleet; the following two years consisted of the peacetime routine of squadron exercises, training cruises, and annual fleet exercises. On 16 February 1910, she collided with the light cruiser . The collision caused significant damage to , though no one on either vessel was injured. She made it back to Kiel for repairs, which lasted eight days. visited Hamburg on 13–17 May that year. From 14 to 20 April 1912, she was temporarily transferred to the Training Squadron, along with the armored cruiser and the light cruiser . For the year 1911–12, won the Kaiser&#x27;s (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery amongst the light cruisers of the High Seas Fleet. From September 1912 through September 1913, she was commanded by (Frigate Captain) Fritz Lüdecke, who would command the ship again during World War I.

On 6 April 1913, she and the cruiser were sent from Kiel to the Adriatic Sea, where she joined the (Mediterranean Division), centered on the battlecruiser and commanded by (Rear Admiral) Konrad Trummler. The ships cruised the eastern Mediterranean for several months, and in late August, was ordered to return to Germany. After arriving in Kiel on 23 September, she was taken into the (Imperial Shipyard) for an overhaul that lasted until the end of December. She was scheduled to return to the Mediterranean Division, but the (Admiralty Staff) reassigned to the North American station to protect German interests in the Mexican Revolution. The cruiser , then in North American waters, was also due to return to Germany, but her intended replacement, , had not yet entered service. On 27 December 1913, departed Germany and arrived off Vera Cruz on 21 January 1914, under the command of Erich Köhler. The United States had already sent a squadron of warships to the city, as had several other countries.

The ordered , which had been on a training cruise for naval cadets, to join off Mexico. was also recalled to reinforce the German naval contingent; after arriving, she was tasked with transferring European nationals to German HAPAG liners. and the British cruiser rescued 900 American citizens trapped in a hotel in Vera Cruz and transferred them to American warships. The German consul in Mexico City requested additional forces, and so provided a landing party of a (Junior Petty Officer) and ten sailors, armed with two MG 08 machine guns. On 15 April 1914, steamed to Tampico on Mexico&#x27;s Gulf coast. That month, the German-flagged merchant ship arrived in Mexico, carrying a load of small arms for the regime of Mexican dictator Victoriano Huerta. The United States had put an arms embargo into effect in an attempt to reduce the violence of the civil war. The US Navy intercepted &quot;Ypiranga&quot; on 21 April. arrived, confiscated the merchantman, and pressed her into naval service to transport German refugees out of Mexico. Despite the American embargo, the Germans delivered the weapons and ammunition to the Mexican government on 28 May.

On 20 July, after the Huerta regime was toppled, carried Huerta, his vice president, Aureliano Blanquet, and their families to Kingston, Jamaica, where Britain had granted them asylum. Upon arriving in Kingston on the 25th, Köhler learned of the rising political tensions in Europe during the July Crisis that followed the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. By this time, the ship was in need of a refit in Germany, and met with her replacement, , in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, the following day. Lüdecke, who had arrived in command of , traded places with Köhler aboard . The initially ordered to return to Germany for overhaul, but the heightened threat of war by the 31st led the staff to countermand the order, instead instructing Lüdecke to prepare to conduct (trade war) in the Atlantic.

===World War I===

After receiving the order to remain in the Atlantic, Lüdecke turned his ship south while maintaining radio silence to prevent hostile warships from discovering his vessel. On the night of 4–5 August, he received a radio report informing him of Britain&#x27;s declaration of war on Germany. He chose the South Atlantic as ″s operational area, and steamed to the Brazilian coast. Off the mouth of the Amazon River, he stopped a British merchant ship on 6 August. The ship, , whose captain professed to know nothing of Britain&#x27;s entry into the war, was permitted to proceed unmolested in accordance with the rules set forth in the Hague Convention of 1907. rendezvoused with the German collier , a converted HSDG vessel. The cruiser moved to the Rocas Atoll on the 12th, along with the HAPAG steamers , , and . After departing the atoll, en route to Trindade, caught the British steamer ; Lüdecke took off the ship&#x27;s crew and then sank the merchantman. captured the British collier on 24 August and sank her after evacuating her crew. After arriving in Trindade, she rendezvoused with the gunboat and several steamers.

On 26 August, while steaming off the mouth of the Río de la Plata, she caught two more British steamers, but the poor condition of ″s engines curtailed further operations. On 5 September, put into Hoste Island for engine maintenance until the 16th. While the ship was there, the HAPAG steamer arrived from Punta Arenas with news of the war, and the heavy merchant traffic off the western coast of South America. Lüdecke decided to steam there, and on 18 September passed the Strait of Magellan. While en route, encountered the French steamer ; Lüdecke refrained from attacking the transport ship, since she had fled into neutral waters. After steaming up the Chilean coast, she stopped in the Juan Fernández Islands, where she made radio contact with the light cruiser , which was operating on the Pacific coast of South America. saw no further success against British shipping, and on 12 October, she joined (Vice Admiral) Maximilian von Spee&#x27;s East Asia Squadron, which had crossed the Pacific and was coaling at Easter Island. The following day, Lüdecke was promoted to (Captain at Sea).

On 18 October, and the East Asia Squadron, centered on the armored cruisers and , departed Easter Island for the South American coast. They arrived at Más a Fuera island on 26 October. The following evening, the German cruisers escorted the auxiliary cruiser and the merchant ships and to Chile. The flotilla arrived off Valparaiso on 30 October, and the following evening, Spee received intelligence that a British cruiser was at the Chilean port of Coronel. Spee decided his squadron should ambush the cruiser——when it was forced to leave port due to Chile&#x27;s neutral status, which required belligerent warships to leave after twenty-four hours. Spee did not realize &quot;Glasgow&quot; was in the company of Rear Admiral Christopher Craddock&#x27;s 4th Cruiser Squadron, which also included the armored cruisers and and the auxiliary cruiser .

====Battle of Coronel====


Early on the morning of 1 November, Spee took his squadron out of Valparaiso, steaming at south toward Coronel. At around 16:00, spotted the smoke column from the leading British cruiser. By 16:25, the other two ships had been spotted. The two squadrons slowly closed the distance, until the Germans opened fire at 18:34, at a range of . The German ships engaged their opposite numbers, with firing on &quot;Otranto&quot;. After ″s third salvo, &quot;Otranto&quot; turned away; the Germans claimed a hit that caused a fire, though &quot;Otranto&quot; reported taking no damage. Following &quot;Otranto&quot;″s departure, shifted her fire to &quot;Glasgow&quot;, which was also targeted by . The two German cruisers hit their British opponent five times.

At around 19:30, Spee ordered and to launch a torpedo attack against the damaged British armored cruisers. increased speed to position herself off the British bows, and briefly spotted &quot;Glasgow&quot; as she was withdrawing, but the British cruiser disappeared in the haze and gathering darkness. then encountered ; both ships initially thought the other was hostile. ″s crew was loading a torpedo when the two ships confirmed each other&#x27;s identity. By 22:00, and the other two light cruisers were deployed in a line that searched unsuccessfully for the British cruisers. had emerged from the battle completely unscathed.

On 3 November, Spee took , , and back to Valparaiso for provisioning and to consult with the . Neutrality laws permitted only three belligerent warships in a port at a given time. and remained with the squadron&#x27;s colliers in Más a Fuera. Spee returned to Más a Fuera on 6 November, and detached and for a visit to Valparaiso, where they also restocked their supplies. The two cruisers arrived on 12 November, left the following day, and met the rest of the squadron at sea on 18 November. Three days later, the squadron anchored in St. Quentin Bay in the Gulf of Penas, where they coaled. The Royal Navy had deployed Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee&#x27;s pair of battlecruisers, and , to hunt down the German squadron. They left Britain on 11 November, and arrived in the Falkland Islands on 7 December. There, they joined the armored cruisers , , and , and the light cruisers &quot;Glasgow&quot; and .

On 26 November, the German East Asia Squadron left St. Quentin Bay, bound for the Atlantic. On 2 December, they caught the Canadian sailing ship &quot;Drummuir&quot;, which was carrying of high-grade Cardiff coal. The following morning, the Germans anchored off Picton Island, where they unloaded the coal from &quot;Drummuir&quot; into their own auxiliaries. On the morning of 6 December, Spee held a council aboard to discuss their next moves. With the support of the captains of and , he successfully argued for an attack on the Falklands to destroy the British wireless station and coal stocks there. Lüdecke and the captains of and all opposed the plan, and were in favor of bypassing the Falklands and proceeding to the La Plata area to continue to raid British shipping.

====Battle of the Falkland Islands====


On the afternoon of 6 December, the German ships departed Picton Island, bound for the Falklands. On 7 December, they rounded Tierra del Fuego and turned north into the Atlantic. They arrived off the Falklands at around 02:00; three hours later, Spee detached and to land a party ashore. By 08:30, the ships were approaching Port Stanley, when they noticed thick columns of smoke rising from the harbor. After closing to the harbor entrance, they quickly realized they were confronted by a much more powerful squadron, which was just getting up steam. Spee immediately broke off the operation and turned east to flee before the British ships could catch his squadron. By 10:45, and had rejoined the fleet, and the German auxiliaries were detached to seek shelter in the maze of islands off Cape Horn.

The British ships set off in pursuit, and by 12:50, Sturdee&#x27;s two battlecruisers had overtaken the Germans. A minute later, he gave the order to open fire at the trailing German ship, . Spee ordered the three small cruisers to try to escape to the south, while he turned back with and in an attempt to hold off the British squadron. Sturdee had foreseen this possibility, and so had ordered his armored and light cruisers to pursue the German light cruisers. The battlecruisers quickly overwhelmed Spee&#x27;s armored cruisers, and destroyed them with heavy loss of life. , with her turbine engines, was able to outpace her pursuers, and was the only German warship to escape destruction. Lüdecke decided to take his ship into the islands off South America to keep a steady supply of coal available.

On 9 December, she passed back around Cape Horn to return to the Pacific. That day, she anchored in Sholl Bay, with only of coal remaining. (lieutenant at sea) Wilhelm Canaris convinced the Chilean naval representative for the region to permit to remain in the area for an extra twenty-four hours so enough coal could be taken aboard to reach Punta Arenas. She arrived there on 12 December, and received of coal from a German steamer. The hoped would be able to break through to the Atlantic and return to Germany, but the poor condition of her engines precluded this. Lüdecke instead decided to attempt to cross the Pacific via Easter Island, the Solomon Islands, and the Dutch East Indies and raid commerce in the Indian Ocean. took on another of coal on 19 January. On 14 February, left the islands off the South American coast for the South Pacific. On 27 February, the cruiser captured the British barque &quot;Conway Castle&quot; south of Más a Tierra. From December to February, the German liner had supplied and had accompanied her northward to a final coaling at Juan Fernández Islands just before the cruiser was scuttled.

On 8 March, was drifting in dense fog when lookouts spotted &quot;Kent&quot;, which also had her engines off, about away. Both ships immediately raised steam, and escaped after a five-hour chase. The strenuous effort depleted her coal stocks and overtaxed her engines. Lüdecke decided his ship was no longer operational, and determined to have his ship interned to preserve it. The following morning, she put into Más a Fuera, dropping anchor in Cumberland Bay at 8:30. The following day, Lüdecke received by wireless the German Admiralty&#x27;s permission to let be interned, and so Lüdecke informed the local Chilean official of his intention to do so.

====Battle of Más a Tierra====


On the morning of 14 March, &quot;Kent&quot; and &quot;Glasgow&quot; approached Cumberland Bay; their appearance was relayed back to by one of her pinnaces, which had been sent to patrol the entrance to the bay. was unable to maneuver, owing to her fuel shortage, and Lüdecke signaled that his ship was no longer a combatant. The British disregarded this message, as well as a Chilean vessel that approached them as they entered the bay. &quot;Glasgow&quot; opened fire, in violation of Chile&#x27;s neutrality; Britain had already informed Chile that British warships would disregard international law if they located in Chilean territorial waters. Shortly thereafter, &quot;Kent&quot; joined in the bombardment as well. The German gunners fired off three shots in response, but the guns were quickly knocked out by British gunfire.

Lüdecke sent the signal &quot;Am sending negotiator&quot; to the British warships, and dispatched Canaris in a pinnace; &quot;Glasgow&quot; continued to bombard the defenseless cruiser. In another attempt to stop the attack, Lüdecke raised the white flag, which prompted &quot;Glasgow&quot; to cease fire. Canaris came aboard to speak with Captain John Luce; the former strongly protested the latter&#x27;s violation of Chile&#x27;s neutrality. Luce simply replied that he had his orders, and demanded an unconditional surrender. Canaris explained that had already been interned by Chile, and thereafter returned to his ship, which had in the meantime been prepared for scuttling.

At 10:45, the scuttling charge detonated in the bow and exploded the forward ammunition magazines. The bow was badly mangled; in about half an hour, the ship had taken on enough water to sink. As it struck the sea floor, the bow was torn from the rest of the ship, which rolled over to starboard. As the rest of the hull settled below the waves, a second scuttling charge exploded in the ship&#x27;s engine rooms.

===Aftermath===

Most of the ship&#x27;s crew managed to escape; only eight men were killed in the attack, with another twenty-nine wounded. The British auxiliary cruiser took fifteen severely wounded men to Valparaiso; four of them died. The destruction of his ship had left Lüdecke in shock, and so Canaris took responsibility for the fate of the ship&#x27;s crew. They remained on the island for five days until two Chilean warships brought a German passenger ship to take the men to Quiriquina Island, where they were interned for the duration of the war. Canaris escaped from the internment camp on 5 August 1915 and reached Germany exactly two months later. On 31 March 1917, a small group of men escaped on the Chilean barque ; the voyage back to Germany lasted 120 days. The rest of the crew did not return to Germany until 1920.

The wreck lies at a depth of . In 2002, the first survey of the wreck was done by a team led by James P. Delgado for the &quot;Sea Hunters&quot; documentary produced by the National Underwater and Marine Agency. The team included the archaeologist Dr. Willi Kramer, the first German to visit the wreck since she sank 88 years before. lies on her starboard side pointed north, toward the beach. The wreck is heavily damaged; much of the upper works, including the bridge, the masts, the funnels, and many of the guns have been torn from the ship. The bow was cut off by the scuttling charges detonated by the ship&#x27;s crew, and sits upright on the sea floor. The stern is also badly damaged, with the main deck blasted away and many shell holes in the ship&#x27;s side. Some of the damage to the aft of the ship appears to have been done by an undocumented salvage operation before Delgado&#x27;s survey. According to German records, was carrying gold coins from their colony at Qingdao; Delgado speculated that this salvage work was an attempt to retrieve these.

In 1965, the ship&#x27;s compass and several flags were recovered and returned to Germany, where they are held at the German Naval Academy Mürwik in Flensburg-Mürwik. In 2006, Chilean and German divers found and recovered ″s bell, which is now in Germany. C. S. Forester&#x27;s 1929 novel &quot;Brown on Resolution&quot;, and two subsequent movies, were inspired by the ″s escape and subsequent destruction.

<text>Sigma ( ; uppercase Σ, lowercase σ, lowercase in word-final position ς; ) is the eighteenth letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 200. In general mathematics, uppercase Σ is used as an operator for summation. When used at the end of a letter-case word (one that does not use all caps), the final form (ς) is used. In &quot;&quot; (Odysseus), for example, the two lowercase sigmas (σ) in the center of the name are distinct from the word-final sigma (ς) at the end. The Latin letter S derives from sigma while the Cyrillic letter Es derives from a lunate form of this letter.

==History==
The shape (Σς) and alphabetic position of sigma is derived from the Phoenician letter (&quot;shin&quot;).

Sigma&#x27;s original name may have been &quot;san&quot;, but due to the complicated early history of the Greek epichoric alphabets, &quot;san&quot; came to be identified as a separate letter in the Greek alphabet, represented as Ϻ.
Herodotus reports that &quot;san&quot; was the name given by the Dorians to the same letter called &quot;sigma&quot; by the Ionians.

According to one hypothesis, the name &quot;sigma&quot; may continue that of Phoenician &quot;samekh&quot; (), the letter continued through Greek &quot;xi&quot;, represented as Ξ. Alternatively, the name may have been a Greek innovation that simply meant &#x27;hissing&#x27;, from the root of (, from Proto-Greek &quot;*sig-jō&quot; &#x27;I hiss&#x27;).

=== Lunate sigma ===
In handwritten Greek during the Hellenistic period (4th–3rd century BC), the epigraphic form of Σ was simplified into a C-like shape, which has also been found on coins from the 4th century BC onward. This became the universal standard form of sigma during late antiquity and the Middle Ages.

Today, it is known as &quot;lunate sigma&quot; (uppercase Ϲ, lowercase ϲ), because of its crescent-like shape, and is still widely used in decorative typefaces in Greece, especially in religious and church contexts, as well as in some modern print editions of classical Greek texts.

A dotted lunate sigma (&quot;sigma periestigmenon&quot;, Ͼ) was used by Aristarchus of Samothrace (220–143 BC) as an editorial sign indicating that the line marked as such is at an incorrect position. Similarly, a reversed sigma (&quot;antisigma&quot;, Ͻ), may mark a line that is out of place. A dotted antisigma (&quot;antisigma periestigmenon&quot;, Ͽ) may indicate a line after which rearrangements should be made, or to variant readings of uncertain priority.

In Greek inscriptions from the late first century BC onwards, Ͻ was an abbreviation indicating that a man&#x27;s father&#x27;s name is the same as his own name, thus Dionysodoros son of Dionysodoros would be written Διονυσόδωρος Ͻ (&quot;Dionysodoros Dionysodorou&quot;).

In Unicode, the above variations of lunate sigma are encoded as ;
, and

===Derived alphabets===
Sigma was adopted in the Old Italic alphabets beginning in the 8th century BC.
At that time a simplified three-stroke version, omitting the lowermost stroke, was already found in Western Greek alphabets,
and was incorporated into classical Etruscan and Oscan, as well as in the earliest Latin epigraphy (early Latin &quot;S&quot;), such as the Duenos inscription.
The alternation between three and four (and occasionally more than four) strokes was also adopted into the early runic alphabet (early form of the &quot;s&quot;-rune).
Both the Anglo-Saxon runes and the Younger Futhark consistently use the simplified three-stroke version.

The letter С of Cyrillic script originates in the lunate form of Sigma.

==Uses==

===Language and linguistics===
* In both Ancient and Modern Greek, the sigma represents the voiceless alveolar fricative . In Modern Greek, this sound is voiced to the voiced alveolar fricative when occurring before , , , , or .
* The uppercase form of sigma (Σ) was re-borrowed into the Latin alphabet—more precisely, the International African Alphabet—to serve as the uppercase of modern &quot;esh&quot; (lowercase: ʃ).
* In phonology, σ is used to represent syllables.
* In linguistics, Σ represents the set of symbols that form an alphabet (see also computer science).
* In historical linguistics, Σ is used to represent a Common Brittonic consonant with a sound between and ; perhaps an aspirated [ʃʰ].

=== Science and mathematics ===

==== Mathematics ====
* In general mathematics, lowercase σ is commonly used to represent unknown angles, additionally serving as a shorthand for &quot;countably&quot;, whereas Σ is regularly used as the operator for summation, e.g.:
formula_1
* In mathematical logic, formula_2 is used to denote the set of formulae with bounded quantifiers beginning with existential quantifiers, alternating formula_3 times between existential and universal quantifiers. This notation reflects an indirect analogy between the relationship of summation and products on one hand, and existential and universal quantifiers on the other. See the article on the arithmetic hierarchy.
* In statistics, σ represents the standard deviation of population or probability distribution (where mu or μ is used for the mean).
* In topology, σ-compact topological space is one that can be written as a countable union of compact subsets.
* In mathematical analysis and in probability theory, there is a type of algebra of sets known as σ-algebra (aka σ-field). Sigma algebra also includes terms such as:
** σ(&quot;A&quot;), denoting the generated sigma-algebra of a set &quot;A&quot;
** Σ-finite measure (see measure theory)
* In number theory, σ is included in various divisor functions, especially the sigma function or sum-of-divisors function.
* In applied mathematics, σ(&quot;T&quot;) denotes the spectrum of a linear map &quot;T&quot;.
* In complex analysis, σ is used in the Weierstrass sigma-function.
* In probability theory and statistics, Σ denotes the covariance matrix of a set of random variables, sometimes in the form formula_4 to distinguish it from the summation operator.
* Theoretical spectral analysis uses σ as standard deviation opposed to lowercase mu as the absolute mean value.

====Biology, physiology, and medicine====
* In biology, the sigma receptor (σ–receptors) is a type of cell surface receptor.
* In biochemistry, the σ factor (or specificity factor) is a protein found in RNA polymerase.
* In bone physiology, the bone remodeling period—i.e., the life span of a basic multicellular unit—has historically been referred to as the sigma period.
* In early 20th-century physiology literature, σ had been used to represent milliseconds.

====Business, finance, and economics====
* In finance, σ is the symbol used to represent volatility of stocks, usually measured by the standard deviation of logarithmic returns.
* In accounting, Σ indicates the balance of invoice classes and the overall amount of debts and demands.
* In macroeconomics, σ is used in equations to represent the elasticity of substitution between two inputs.
* In the machine industry, Six Sigma (6σ) is a quality model based on the standard deviation.

====Chemistry====
* Sigma bonds (σ bonds) are the strongest type of covalent chemical bond.
* In organic chemistry, σ symbolizes the sigma constant of Hammett equation.
* In alchemy, Σ was sometimes used to represent sugar.

====Engineering and computer science====
* In computer science, Σ represents the set of symbols that form an alphabet (see also linguistics)
* Relational algebra uses the values formula_5 and formula_6 to denote selections, which are a type of unary operation.
* In machine learning, σ is used in the formula that derives the Sigmoid function.
* In radar jamming or electronic warfare, radar cross-sections (RCS) are commonly represented as σ when measuring the size of a target&#x27;s image on radar.
* In signal processing, σ denotes the damping ratio of a system parameter.
* In theoretical computer science, Σ serves as the busy beaver function.
* In civil engineering, σ refers to the normal stress applied on a material or structure.

====Physics====
* In nuclear and particle physics, σ is used to denote cross sections in general (see also RCS), while Σ represents macroscopic cross sections [1/length].
* The symbol is to denote the Stefan–Boltzmann constant.
* In relation to fundamental properties of material, σ is often used to signify electrical conductivity.
* In electrostatics, σ represents surface charge density.
* In continuum mechanics, σ is used to signify normal stress.
* In condensed matter physics, Σ denotes self-energy.
* The symbol can be used to signify surface tension (alternatively, &quot;γ&quot; or &quot;T&quot; are also used instead).
* In quantum mechanics, σ is used to indicate Pauli matrices.
* In astronomy, σ represents velocity dispersion.
* In astronomy, the prefix Σ is used to designate double stars of the Catalogus Novus Stellarum Duplicium by Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve.
* In particle physics, Σ represents a class of baryons.

=== Organizations ===
* During the 1930s, an uppercase Σ was in use as the symbol of the Ação Integralista Brasileira, a fascist political party in Brazil.
* Sigma Corporation uses the name of the letter but not the letter itself, but in many Internet forums, photographers refer to the company or its lenses using the letter.
* Sigma Aldrich incorporate both the name and the character in their logo.

<text>NextBus is a public transit vehicle tracking system which uses global positioning satellite information to predict when the next vehicle will arrive at any given transit stop, which attempts to reduce wait times and reliance on schedules.

NextBus is developed by Nextbus Information Systems, Inc., a subsidiary of Cubic Transportation Systems, for buses, trams, light rail operations and other public transport vehicles.

The company was founded by Ken Schmier, Bryce Nesbitt and Paul Freda in 1997 in Emeryville, California with U.S. Patents 6,006,159 &amp; 6,374,176. As of 2013, the company systems were operating in over 130 locations. NextBus Information Systems, Inc. was previously a subsidiary of Webtech Wireless, Inc. and was acquired by Cubic Transportation Systems in January 2013.

==Overview==

Each vehicle is fitted with a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, which transmits speed and location data to a central location. There, a computer running proprietary software calculates the projected arrival times for all stops in the system using this data, along with configuration information and historic travel times. These times are then converted to a &#x27;wait time&#x27; and made available via the NextBus website and electronic signs at bus stops and tram stops as well as cell phones, and other wireless devices via the Internet.

==Usage==
NextBus provides a real-time passenger information system for all routes for several major transportation agencies including the San Francisco Municipal Railway, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, and the Toronto Transit Commission. The system is also available in many other smaller universities and public transportation agencies for a total of approximately 100 systems.

<text>The Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) is a non-profit organization formed in 1985 to recognize beer tasting and evaluation skills. The BJCP certifies and ranks beer judges through an examination and monitoring process.

==Purpose==
The BJCP has three functions within the US beer community. First, it provides a standards-based organization supplying qualified judges to both amateur and commercial brewing competitions designed to promote the appreciation of beer styles and their accurate production by brewers. The BJCP tracks members&#x27; participation as judges, organizers, or stewards in BJCP-sanctioned brewing competitions and awards continuing education units for participation.

The BJCP also publishes style guidelines categorizing beer, mead, and cider styles. These guidelines are used in both the examination of Judges by the BJCP and, voluntarily, by brewing competition organizers; the BJCP also encourages prospective test-takers to study the available literature on styles and brewing. New style guidelines were released in May 2015. As well as better addressing world styles, the BJCP Style Guidelines comprise three separate documents for beer, mead, and cider styles, allowing them to be updated on different schedules.

Finally, the BJCP organizes a program of beer examinations wherein test-takers complete a series of written questions regarding brewing, beer styles and judging and then perform six beer judging exercises.

==Organization==
Judges are ranked within the certification program based upon a combination their score on a standardized certification test and experience points received for participating in sanctioned competition program events, in BJCP exams, or continuing education program events. The ranks include Apprentice, Recognized, Certified, National, Master, Grand Master (with incremental levels, for example Grand Master I, Grand Master II, etc.), and Honorary Grand Master. The BJCP also certifies judges in mead and cider.

==Influence==
Its standards for beers have been cited by the Wall Street Journal and by &quot;Zymurgy&quot;, the journal for members of the American Homebrewers Association, among others.

==History==

The BJCP was founded in 1985, when the first exam was given at the American Homebrewers Association (AHA) annual conference in Estes Park, Colorado. During its formative years, the program was jointly sponsored by the AHA and the Home Wine and Beer Trade Association (HWBTA). Both organizations sanctioned local homebrew competitions, and each had a national competition. Consequently, both were interested in fostering the improvement of judging skills and building up a pool of experienced beer judges. The program was administered at the AHA offices, and there were two Co-Directors, one from each association. Jim Homer was the AHA Co-Director, and Pat Baker served the same role for the HWBTA.

In August 1995, after a successful ten-year history, support was withdrawn by the AHA, which had intentions of starting its own beer judging program. The HWBTA was unable to continue operating the program by itself, so the BJCP was expected to simply fade away. However, a considerable number of judges had been built up by this time, and many of them were quite active. A small number of these activists decided that the program could be operated solely by volunteers from among themselves, and decided to attempt the continuation of the BJCP as an independent entity.

The effort was coordinated in a haphazard fashion, mainly through e-mail, but a consensus gradually emerged and the program was able to continue its growth. A board of directors was established to guide the program, composed of six (currently ten) Regional Representatives elected by members from each of seven geographical regions throughout North America. The U.S. was divided into geographic regions, and an election for the board of directors was held by mailing ballots to members.

Assisting the board was program administrator Russ Wigglesworth, who remained in his post and assumed the duties of maintaining the database of members, sending program materials to competition organizers, providing certificates and pins to new and newly promoted judges, and performing other essential administrative tasks. Wigglesworth remains in his position, but began to transfer his duties to other members in 2004 and this transfer is nearly complete.

In the early years, there were regional elections for the Board, conducted entirely by postal ballot, and a newsletter was published for several years to inform the membership. An annual letter was also sent by the Program Administrator to each member, listing the experience points earned from judging in various competitions. These activities are now done electronically, with the BJCP website serving as the repository of information including a password-protected section where members can check their personal record, and website voting, competition registration, and point reporting.

In 2007, former BJCP Treasurer William R. Slack was indicted for mail fraud in the District Court of the District of New Hampshire. Slack later entered a plea agreement. Mr. Slack admitted that he misappropriated BJCP funds steadily during his tenure as BJCP Treasurer. Mr. Slack was sentenced to (1) restitution of approximately $43K, (2) five years probation, and (3) incarceration of one week per month for twelve months.

<text>Johannes Winkler (29 May 1897 – 27 December 1947) was a German rocket pioneer who co-founded with Max Valier of Opel RAK the first German rocket society &quot;Verein für Raumschiffahrt&quot; and launched, after Friedrich Wilhelm Sander&#x27;s successful Opel RAK liquid-rocket launches in 1929, one of the first successful liquid-fuelled rocket in Europe.

In 1915 during World War I, he joined the German army and was wounded in action the following year, leading to a lengthy hospitalisation. After his recovery, he studied as a machinist at the Danzig technical college and found a job at Junkers.

On 5 July 1927, he was one of the founders the &quot;Verein für Raumschiffahrt&quot; (VfR – &quot;Spaceflight Society&quot;). He also was the society&#x27;s first president and editor of the VfR&#x27;s &quot;Die Rakete&quot;&#x27; journal.

On 14 March 1931 at 4:45 pm, he launched the Hückel-Winkler I (HW-I) at the Gross Kühnau drill field near Dessau. According to his account, it was planned to reach an altitude of 500 meters, but it turned and flew horizontally, landing 200 meters from the pad. The maximum altitude of the rocket was not recorded. It was powered by liquid oxygen and liquid methane.

Eighteen months after the HW-I flight, Winkler launched the HW-II on 6 October 1932 in a public demonstration, which included invited officials from the Königsberg council. Unfortunately, the rocket exploded within seconds of ignition because of a faulty fuel valve.

Winkler designed a number of other rockets and JATO units for Junkers and then a government aviation research institute, but none left the drawing board.

<doc id="421008" wikidata="Q2138614" url="?curid=421008" title="Pearl (poem)">
<text>Pearl () is a late 14th-century Middle English poem that is considered one of the most important surviving Middle English works. With elements of medieval allegory and from the dream vision genre, the poem is written in a North-West Midlands variety of Middle English and is highly—though not consistently—alliterative; there is, among other stylistic features, a complex system of stanza-linking.

A father, mourning the loss of his (pearl), falls asleep in a garden; in his dream, he encounters the &#x27;Pearl-maiden&#x27;—a beautiful and heavenly woman—standing across a stream in a strange landscape. In response to his questioning and attempts to obtain her, she answers with Christian doctrine. Eventually she shows him an image of the Heavenly City, and herself as part of the retinue of Christ the Lamb. However, when the Dreamer attempts to cross the stream, he awakens suddenly from his dream and reflects on its significance.

The poem survives in a single manuscript (London, British Library MS Cotton MS Nero A X), which includes two other religious narrative poems: &quot;Patience&quot;, and &quot;Cleanness&quot;, and the romance &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;. All are thought to be by the same author, dubbed the &quot;Pearl poet&quot; or &quot;Gawain poet&quot;, on the evidence of stylistic and thematic similarities. The first complete publication of &quot;Pearl&quot;, &quot;Patience&quot; and &quot;Cleanness&quot; was in &quot;Early English Alliterative Poems in the West Midland Dialect of the fourteenth century&quot;, printed by the Early English Text Society in 1864.

==Author==

Though the real name of &quot;The Pearl Poet&quot; (or poets) is unknown, some inferences about them can be drawn from an informed reading of their works. The original manuscript is known in academic circles as &quot;Cotton Nero A.x&quot;, following a naming system used by one of its owners, Robert Cotton, a collector of medieval English texts. Before the manuscript came into Cotton&#x27;s possession, it was in the library of Henry Savile of Bank in Yorkshire. Little is known about its previous ownership, and until 1824, when the manuscript was introduced to the academic community in a second edition of Thomas Warton&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; edited by Richard Price, it was almost entirely unknown. Now held in the British Library, it has been dated to the late 14th century, so the poet was a contemporary of Geoffrey Chaucer, author of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;; however, it is highly unlikely that the two ever met. The three other works found in the same manuscript as &quot;Pearl&quot; (commonly known as &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, &quot;Patience&quot;, and &quot;Cleanness&quot; or &quot;Purity&quot;) are often considered to be written by the same author. However, the manuscript containing these poems was transcribed by a copyist and not by the original poet. Although nothing explicitly suggests that all four poems are by the same poet, comparative analysis of dialect, verse form, and diction have pointed towards common authorship.

What is known today about the poet is general. As J. R. R. Tolkien and E. V. Gordon, after reviewing the text&#x27;s allusions, style, and themes, concluded in 1925:
The poet is understood to have lived in the North Shropshire/Cheshire/Staffordshire dialect region. 

Some scholars believe that the Pearl Poet was also the author of the poem &quot;St. Erkenwald&quot;, which bears stylistic similarities to &quot;Gawain&quot;.

The most commonly suggested candidate for authorship is John Massey of Cotton, Cheshire, though he has been dated by some scholars to a time outside the Gawain poet&#x27;s era. 
Thus, ascribing authorship to John Massey is still controversial and a number of critics are not confident to go beyond saying the Gawain poet cannot yet be confidently identified beyond the region he came from.

==Genre and poetics==
Since the time of the poem&#x27;s first publication in the late 19th century, a great deal of critical discussion has taken place on the question of to which genre the poem belongs. Early editors, such as Morris, Gollancz and Osgood, took for granted that the poem was an elegy for the poet&#x27;s lost daughter (presumed to have been named Margaret, i.e. &#x27;pearl&#x27;); several scholars however, including W. H. Schofield, R. M. Garrett, and W. K. Greene were quick to point out the flaws in this assumption and sought to establish a definitive allegorical reading of the poem. There is no doubt that the poem has elements of medieval allegory and dream vision (as well as the slightly more esoteric genre of the verse lapidary), but all attempts to reduce the poem&#x27;s complex symbolism to a single interpretation have fallen flat. More recent criticism has pointed to the subtle, shifting symbolism of the pearl as one of the poem&#x27;s chief virtues, recognizing that there is no inherent contradiction between the poem&#x27;s elegiac and its allegorical aspects, and that the sophisticated allegorical significance of the Pearl Maiden is not unusual but in fact has several quite well-known parallels in medieval literature, the most celebrated being probably Dante&#x27;s Beatrice.

Besides the symbolic, on a sheer formal level, Pearl is almost astounding in its complexity, and is recognized to be, in the words of one prominent scholar, &quot;the most highly wrought and intricately constructed poem in Middle English&quot; (Bishop 27). It is 1212 lines long, and has 101 stanzas of 12 lines, each with the rhyme scheme ABABABABBCBC. Stanzas are grouped in sections of five (except for XV, which has six), and each section is marked by a capital letter in the manuscript; within each section, the stanzas are tied together by the repetition of a key &quot;link&quot;-word in the last line of each section, which is then echoed in the first line of the following section. The oft-praised &quot;roundness&quot; of the poem is thus emphasized, and the final link-word is repeated in the first line of the whole, forging a connection between the two ends of the poem and producing a structure that is itself circular. Alliteration is used frequently, but not consistently, throughout the poem, and there are several other sophisticated poetic devices.

==Structure and content==
The poem may be divided into three parts: an introduction (or &quot;Prologue&quot;), a dialogue between the two main characters in which the Pearl instructs the narrator, and a description of the New Jerusalem with the narrator&#x27;s awakening.

===Prologue===
Sections I–IV (stanzas 1–20)
The narrator, distraught at the loss of his Pearl, falls asleep in an &quot;erber grene&quot; – a green garden – and begins to dream. In his dream he is transported to an other-worldly garden; the divine is thus set in opposition to the terrestrial, a persistent thematic concern within the poem. Wandering by the side of a beautiful stream, he becomes convinced paradise is on the other shore. As he looks for a crossing, he sees a young maid whom he identifies as his Pearl. She welcomes him.

===Dialogue===
; Sections V–VII (stanzas 21–35)
When he asks whether she is the pearl he has lost, she tells him he has lost nothing, that his pearl is merely a rose which has naturally withered. He wants to cross to her side, but she says it is not so easy, that he must resign himself to the will and mercy of God. He asks about her state. She tells him that the Lamb has taken her as His queen.

; Sections VIII–XI (stanzas 36–60)
He wonders whether she has replaced Mary as Queen of Heaven. He also objects that she was too young to merit such an exalted position through her works. She responds that no one envies Mary&#x27;s position as Queen of courtesy, but that all are members of the body of Christ. Adopting a homiletic discourse, she recounts as proof the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard. He objects to the idea that God rewards every man equally, regardless of his apparent due. She responds that God gives the same gift of Christ&#x27;s redemption to all.

; Sections XII–XV (stanzas 61–81)
She instructs him on several aspects of sin, repentance, grace and salvation. She describes the earthly and the heavenly Jerusalem, citing the Apostle John and focusing on Christ&#x27;s past sacrifice and present glory. She wears the Pearl of Great Price because she has been washed in the blood of the Lamb and advises him to forsake all and buy this pearl.

===Epilogue===
; Sections XVI–XX (stanzas 82–101)
He asks about the heavenly Jerusalem; she tells him it is the city of God. He asks to go there; she says that God forbids that, but he may see it by a special dispensation. They walk upstream, and he sees the city across the stream, which is described in a paraphrase of the Apocalypse. He also sees a procession of the blessed. Plunging into the river in his desperation to cross, he awakes from the dream back in the &quot;erber&quot; and resolves to fulfill the will of God.

==Afterlife==
Death and transience are major themes in the poem; outside of the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard which we are presented in stanzas 42–60 we see notable reference to another biblical passage Matthew&#x27;s Sermon on the Mount, in which he states &quot;Do not lay up for yourselves treasure on earth where they moth and rust destroy ... but lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys&quot; (Matthew 6:19–21). This lesson becomes vital to the speakers understanding of death: we see him at the opening of the text tormented by images of death and decay in relation to his daughter who we are told &quot;lyfed not two yer&quot;. The text repeatedly highlights the faults in her father&#x27;s materialistic views, as the maiden never refers to him by name but simply as &quot;jeweller&quot;, and a distinctly poor one at that, appearing unable to realise the girl&#x27;s true heavenly wealth; while her purity and innocence are displayed through several features—her white clothing, radiance, and pale complexion (all of which could also be considered as traits of a pearl). The apparition then rejoicingly informs the man that she now stands at the side of Christ as one of the 144 thousand brides of the lamb, residing in New Jerusalem as a Queen.

The text&#x27;s structure of 1212 lines is reflective of this heavenly city, which is said in the Book of Revelation to be twelve thousand by twelve thousand furlongs and containing twelve gates for the twelve tribes of Israel (Revelation 21:12–17). But its poetic symmetry seems to be offset with the addition of an extra stanza bringing its total to 101, several scholars have suggested it to be reflective of the Pearl&#x27;s encasement while others such as literary critic Sarah Stanbury believe it &quot;suggests new beginnings after return&quot;. Towards the close of the poem, we are given a hallucinatory description of the spiritual bliss which awaits the virtuous within this golden citadel situated on a hill of precious stones. We will begin to see a slow and gradual break down in our protagonist&#x27;s urbanity as he struggles to grasp the conventions of this realm, the dreamer&#x27;s perceived ownership of the maiden &quot;my Pearl&quot;, is an attitude derived from the social norms of the period as &quot;the woman has no life outside the home, but simply moves, plotlessly, from daughterhood to wifehood&quot;. A process which death has interrupted for the Pearl and the Jeweller, but still, he assumes a patriarchal role and wrongly surmises that he may remain in this paradise devoid of her permission. However, the reversal in social status enables the divinely proclaimed Queen to ethically educate the dreamer during her assault on his morality, yet it seems to little avail. In the final stanzas of the poem, we witness the jeweller defiantly attempt to leap the brook which separates the living from this Edenic paradise, only for him to awaken once more upon the burial mound.

&quot;Pearl&quot; is the source of Thomas Eccleshare&#x27;s 2013 play &quot;Perle&quot;, a solo performance staged in the Soho Theatre.

The Mediaeval Baebes set a passage from Part III to music, recording &quot;Pearl&quot; on their 1998 album &quot;Worldes Blysse&quot;.

<text>Henry Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel (23 April 151224 February 1580) was an English nobleman, who over his long life assumed a prominent place at the court of all the later Tudor sovereigns.

==Court career under Henry VIII==
He was the only son of William Fitzalan, 11th Earl of Arundel, and his second wife Anne Percy, daughter of Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland, and was named for Henry VIII, who personally stood as his godfather at his baptism.

At 15, Henry Fitzalan became a page at the court of King Henry VIII, attending the king to Calais in 1532. When he came of age, in 1533, he was summoned to Parliament as Lord Maltravers, a subsidiary title of his father, who was still alive. He attended the trials of Anne Boleyn and her alleged lover Lord Rochford in May 1536.

In 1540 he was appointed deputy of Calais. He remained there, improving the fortifications at his own expense, until his father&#x27;s death in early 1544. He returned to England to assume the earldom, and was made a Knight of the Garter. War with France soon brought him back to the continent, where he spent much of 1544. He then returned to England, where the king appointed him Lord Chamberlain.

==Edward VI==
After King Henry&#x27;s death in 1547, the Earl was Earl Marshal acted as Edward VI&#x27;s coronation. He continued as Lord Chamberlain, and in addition, by the terms of Henry&#x27;s will, was designated one of the council of 12 assistant executors. Under the new King&#x27;s uncle, Lord Protector Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, Arundel&#x27;s influence diminished, and he soon became an advocate of Somerset&#x27;s removal.

Somerset was deposed and sent to the Tower of London in October 1549, with Arundel, Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton, and John Dudley, Earl of Warwick (later Duke of Northumberland) among the leaders of the new governing group. In early 1550 Warwick removed Arundel and Southampton, who were religious conservatives, from office. Arundel was placed under house arrest under dubious charges of peculation. He was also fined £12,000, £8,000 of which was later remitted. Within a few months, he was cleared of the charges, but the experience pushed him into the camp of the Duke of Somerset, who had been released from the Tower and readmitted to the Privy Council. When Somerset was again arrested in 1551, Arundel was implicated in some of his plots, and was himself arrested and imprisoned for a year. He was eventually pardoned, again heavily fined, and returned to his place on the Council in May 1553.

==Intrigues and position under Mary I==
King Edward&#x27;s health was seriously declining, and on 21 June 1553 Arundel was among those who signed Edward&#x27;s letters patent which conferred the succession on Lady Jane Grey. After the King&#x27;s death, and after Northumberland had left London, however, together with the Earl of Pembroke, he worked for the proclamation of Mary I on 19 July 1553. Arundel tricked Northumberland into attacking Mary, then called an assembly of the leaders of the city, denounced Northumberland, and had Mary proclaimed queen. Taking the great seal and a letter of submission by the Council, he then rode off to Framlingham, where Mary was staying. He then secured Northumberland in Cambridge, and returned to London with Mary.

At Mary&#x27;s coronation, Arundel was for the second time High Constable, and was then appointed Lord Steward of the royal household. He served in various roles in her court, being, for example, one of the nobles who received her husband Philip II of Spain when he landed at Southampton. Later, he presided over the trial of his brother-in-law, Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, assisted in suppressing Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion in 1554, was dispatched on foreign missions, and in September 1555 accompanied Philip to Brussels. The same year he and others received a charter under the name of Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands, for the discovery of unknown lands, and was made high steward of the University of Oxford, being chosen chancellor in 1559, but resigning his office in the same year. In 1557, on the prospect of a war with France, he was appointed lieutenant-general of the forces for the defence of the country, and in 1558 attended the conference for the negotiation of peace. He returned to England on the death of Mary in November 1558.

In 1555 he promoted the marriage of his daughter Mary to 4th Duke of Norfolk. Mary died in August 1557, but shortly before she died she gave birth to her only son, Philip Howard, who would later become Henry&#x27;s sole heir.

In 1556, Mary I sold the unfinished Nonsuch Palace that had been designed and built by her father and predecessor, King Henry VIII, to Arundel, who completed it by 1559. In 1585, the Treaty of Nonsuch was signed by Elizabeth I of England and the Dutch Republic at the palace. After Arundel&#x27;s death in 1580, his son-in-law, John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley, sold the palace back to Elizabeth I and the Crown in 1590–1592, in exchange for lands valued at £534. Elizabeth I continued to use Nonsuch Palace as a royal residence until her death in 1603, whereupon her successor, James I and VI of England and Scotland, inherited it.

==Positions under Elizabeth I==
Although Elizabeth I did not trust him, he was too powerful to be slighted or ignored, and so he was retained in his various offices when she ascended the throne. For the third time, he had a high place at a royal coronation. However, as a Roman Catholic, he opposed the arrest of his co-religionists and the war with Scotland. He incurred the queen&#x27;s displeasure in 1562 by holding a meeting at his house during her illness to consider the question of succession and promote the claims of Lady Katherine Grey. In 1564, being suspected of intrigues against the government, he was dismissed from the lord-stewardship and confined to his house, but was restored to favour in December.

In March 1566 he went to Padua, but being summoned back by the queen he returned to London on the 17th of April 1567. The following year he served on the commission of inquiry into the charges against Mary, Queen of Scots. He made use of an international incident in 1568 as a means of effecting William Cecil&#x27;s overthrow, and urged upon the Spanish government the stoppage of trade.

In January he alarmed Elizabeth by communicating to her a supposed Spanish project for aiding Mary and replacing her on her throne, and put before the queen in writing his own objections to the adoption of extreme measures against her. In September, on the discovery of Norfolk&#x27;s plot, he was arrested, but not having committed himself sufficiently to incur the charge of treason in the rebellion he escaped punishment, was released in March 1570, and was recalled by Robert Dudley to the council with the aim of embarrassing Cecil. He again renewed his intrigues, which were at length to some extent exposed by the discovery of the Ridolfi plot in September 1571. He was once more arrested, and not liberated till December 1572 after Norfolk&#x27;s execution.

In June 1578 his daughter, Jane died without living descendants, as her only three children from her marriage to John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley all died in infancy. With the death of his daughter Jane, his grandson Philip Howard, son of his daughter Mary, was left as his only surviving descendant and thus became the heir to the Earldom of Arundel and the entirety of the vast estates Henry owned in Sussex, including Arundel Castle. 

Henry died on 24 February 1580 and was buried in the Fitzalan Chapel of Arundel Castle, where a monument was erected to his memory.
Coaches were introduced into England from France by Henry Fitzalan, who travelled widely on the Continent in the mid-1560s.

==Marriage and children==

Henry Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel, was first married to Lady Katherine Grey, daughter of Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset, and Margaret Wotton. By her, he had three children:
* Lady Jane FitzAlan (1537–1576/7), who married John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley
* Henry Fitzalan, Lord Maltravers (1538–1556), died young 
* Lady Mary FitzAlan (1540–1557), who married Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, and whose son Philip, eventually inherited the Earldom of Arundel.

It is by said marriage that Arundel was the brother-in-law of Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, father of Lady Jane Grey.

Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, 3rd Marquess of Dorset had been betrothed to Henry Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel&#x27;s sister, also named Katherine, but refused the match. The plan had been to make them double brothers-in-law. Instead, Henry Grey, then the 3rd Marquess of Dorset, opted to marry Frances Brandon.

His second wife was Mary, daughter of Sir John Arundell of a prominent Cornish family, and widow of Robert Radcliffe, 1st Earl of Sussex. They had no children.

Widower again, Henry is presented as suitor of Princess Cecilia of Sweden. However, nothing came out of it.

==Portraiture==

Arundel&#x27;s portrait was painted several times, including once by Hans Holbein and by Hans Eworth.

<doc id="421012" wikidata="Q194181" url="?curid=421012" title="War reparations">
<text>War reparations are compensation payments made after a war by one side to the other. They are intended to cover damage or injury inflicted during a war. War reparations can take the form of hard currency, precious metals, natural resources, industrial assets, or intellectual properties. Loss of territory in a peace settlement is usually considered to be distinct from war reparations.

War reparations are often governed by treaties which belligerent parties negotiate as part of a peace settlement. Payment of reparations often occur as part of a condition to remove occupying troops or under the threat of re-occupation. The legal basis for war reparations in modern international law is Article 3 of the Hague Convention of 1907.

Prominent examples of war reparations include Carthage&#x27;s indemnity paid to Rome following the First Punic War, French reparations following the Napoleonic Wars, Haiti&#x27;s reparations to France following the Haitian War of Independence (1791–1804), French reparations to Germany following the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), and German reparations following World War I.

== History ==
Making one party pay a war indemnity is a common practice with a long history.

Rome imposed large indemnities on Carthage after the First (Treaty of Lutatius, 241 BC) and Second Punic Wars.

There was also the case of 230 million silver taels in reparations imposed on defeated China after the First Sino-Japanese War led Japan to a similar decision.

There have been attempts to codify reparations both in the Statutes of the International Criminal Court and the UN Basic Principles on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims, and some scholars have argued that individuals should have a right to seek compensation for wrongs they sustained during warfare through tort law.

=== Europe ===
==== Kalmar War ====
King Christian IV of Denmark attacked Sweden in the 1611–1613 Kalmar War but failed to accomplish his main objective of forcing it to return to the Kalmar Union. The war led to no territorial changes, but Sweden was forced to pay a war indemnity of 1 million silver riksdaler to Denmark, an amount known as the &quot;Älvsborg ransom&quot;. King Christian used this money to found several towns and fortresses, most notably Glückstadt (founded as a rival to Hamburg) and Christiania.

==== Napoleonic War ====
Following Napoleon&#x27;s final loss at the Battle of Waterloo, under the Treaty of Paris (1815), defeated France was ordered to pay 700 million francs in indemnities. France was also to pay additional money to cover the cost of providing additional defensive fortifications to be built by neighbouring Coalition countries. It was the most expensive war reparation ever paid by a country (in proportion to its GDP).

==== Franco-Prussian War ====

After the Franco-Prussian War, according to conditions of Treaty of Frankfurt (May 10, 1871), France was obliged to pay a war indemnity of 5 billion gold francs in five years. The indemnity was proportioned, according to population, to be the exact equivalent to the indemnity imposed by Napoleon on Prussia in 1807. German troops remained in parts of France until the last installment of the indemnity was paid in September 1873, ahead of schedule.

==== Greco-Turkish War of 1897 ====

Following the Greco-Turkish War (1897), defeated Greece was forced to pay a large war indemnity to Turkey (£4 million). Greece, which was already in default, was compelled to permit oversight of its public finances by an international financial commission.

==== World War I ====

Russians agreed to pay reparations to the Central Powers when Russia exited the war in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (which was repudiated by the Bolshevik government eight months later). Bulgaria paid reparations of 2.25 billion gold francs (90 million pounds) to the Entente, according to the Treaty of Neuilly.

Germany agreed to pay reparations of 132 billion gold marks to the Triple Entente in the Treaty of Versailles. When Germany stopped making payments in 1932 after the agreement reached at the Lausanne Conference failed to be ratified, Germany had paid only a part of the sum. This still left Germany with debts it had incurred in order to finance the reparations, and these were revised by the Agreement on German External Debts in 1953. After another pause pending the reunification of Germany, the last installment of these debt repayments was paid on 3 October 2010.

==== World War II Germany ====

During World War II, Germany extracted payments from occupied countries, compelled loans, stole or destroyed property. In addition, countries were obliged to provide resources, and forced labour.

After World War II, according to the Potsdam conference held between July 17 and August 2, 1945, Germany was to pay the Allies US$23 billion mainly in machinery and manufacturing plants. Dismantling in the West stopped in 1950. Reparations to the Soviet Union stopped in 1953 (only paid by the GDR).

Beginning before the German surrender and continuing for the next two years, the United States pursued a vigorous program of harvesting technological and scientific know-how as well as patents and many leading scientists in Germany (known as Operation Paperclip). Historian John Gimbel, in his book &quot;Science Technology and Reparations: Exploitation and Plunder in Postwar Germany&quot;, states that the &quot;intellectual reparations&quot; (referring to German scientists) taken by the Allies amounted to close to $10 billion.
German reparations were partly to be in the form of forced labor. By 1947, approximately 4,000,000 German POWs and civilians were used as forced labor (under various headings, such as &quot;reparations labor&quot; or &quot;enforced labor&quot;) in Europe, Canada and the United States after the end of the Second World War.

==== World War II Italy ====
According to the Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947, Italy agreed to pay reparations of about US$125 million to Yugoslavia, US$105 million to Greece, US$100 million to the Soviet Union, US$25 million to Ethiopia, and US$5 million to Albania.

==== World War II Hungary ====
Hungary agreed to pay reparations of US$200 million to the Soviet Union, and US$100 million apiece to Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.

==== World War II Romania ====
Romania agreed to pay reparations of US$300 million to the Soviet Union. Romanian economists estimated that by February 1947 the Romanian economy had suffered further losses due to returning seized goods (US$320 million), restoring properties to the United Nations and their nationals (US$200 million), renouncing German debts (US$200 million), irregular requisitioning (US$150 million) and maintenance of the Soviet Army unit on its territory (US$75 million). Romania paid $5.6 million in 1945 and, in the assessment of Digi24, it was coerced to pay through SovRom $2 billion.

==== World War II Finland ====

Finland could only negotiate an interim peace deal with Soviet Union by agreeing to extensive reparations, and was eventually the only country to pay settled war reparations in full. The total amount of reparations rose to US$500 million, at the value of the dollar in 1953.

=== Japan ===

==== Sino-Japanese War of 1895 ====
The Treaty of Shimonoseki, signed on April 17, 1895, obliged China to pay an indemnity of 200 million silver taels (¥3.61 billion) to Japan; and to open the ports of Shashi, Chongqing, Suzhou and Hangzhou to Japanese trade.

==== World War II Japan ====
According to Article 14 of the Treaty of San Francisco (1951):

It is recognized that Japan should pay reparations to the Allied Powers for the damage and suffering caused by it during the war...Japan will promptly enter into negotiations with Allied Powers so desiring, whose present territories were occupied by Japanese forces and damaged by Japan, with a view to assisting to compensate those countries for the cost of repairing the damage done, by making available the services of the Japanese people in production, salvaging and other work for the Allied Powers in question.

War reparations made pursuant to the San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan (1951) include: reparations amounting to US$550 million (198 billion yen 1956) were made to the Philippines, and US$39 million (14.04 billion yen 1959) to South Vietnam; payment to the International Committee of the Red Cross to compensate prisoners of war (POW) of 4.5 million pounds sterling (4.54109 billion yen) was made; and Japan relinquished all overseas assets, approximately US$23.681 billion (379.499 billion yen).

Japan signed the peace treaty with 49 nations in 1952 and concluded 54 bilateral agreements that included those with Burma (US$20 million 1954, 1963), South Korea (US$300 million 1965), Indonesia (US$223.08 million 1958), the Philippines (US$525 million/52.94 billion yen 1967), Malaysia (25 million Malaysian dollars/2.94 billion yen 1967), Thailand (5.4 billion yen 1955), Micronesia (1969), Laos (1958), Cambodia (1959), Mongolia (1977), Spain ($5.5 million 1957), Switzerland, the Netherlands ($10 million 1956), Sweden and Denmark. Payments of reparations started in 1955, lasted for 23 years and ended in 1977. For countries that renounced any reparations from Japan, it agreed to pay an indemnity and/or grants in accordance with bilateral agreements. In the Joint Communiqué of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (1972), the People&#x27;s Republic of China renounced its demand for war reparations from Japan. In the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956, the Soviet Union waived its rights to reparations from Japan, and both Japan and the Soviet Union waived all reparations claims arising from war. Additionally, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), under President J. R. Jayewardene, declined war reparations from Japan.

===Iraq===
====Invasion of Kuwait====
After the Gulf War, Iraq accepted United Nations Security Council Resolution 687, which declared Iraq&#x27;s financial liability for damage caused in its invasion of Kuwait. The United Nations Compensation Commission (UNCC) was established, and US$350 billion in claims were filed by governments, corporations, and individuals. UNCC accepted and awarded compensations claims for $52.4 billion to approximately 1.5 million successful claimants; as of July 2019, $48.7 billion has been paid and only $3.7 billion was left to be paid to Kuwait on behalf of the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation. The UNCC says that its prioritization of claims by natural people, ahead of claims by governments and entities or corporations (legal persons), &quot;marked a significant step in the evolution of international claims practice&quot;. Funds for these payments were to come from a 30% share of Iraq&#x27;s oil revenues from the oil for food program.

====Invasion by the United States====
Certain groups in Iraq and the United States have campaigned for reparations by the United States for the devastation and health effects suffered by Iraqi citizens during the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in the Iraq War. However, there has been little international support.

<doc id="421015" wikidata="Q964658" url="?curid=421015" title="Outlaw country">
<text>Outlaw country is a subgenre of American country music created by a small group of artists active in the 1970s and early 1980s, known collectively as the outlaw movement, who fought for and won their creative freedom outside of the Nashville establishment that dictated the sound of most country music of the era. Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson, David Allan Coe and Jerry Jeff Walker were among the movement&#x27;s most commercially successful members.

The music has its roots in earlier subgenres like Western, honky tonk, rockabilly, and progressive country, and is characterized by a blend of rock and folk rhythms, country instrumentation, and introspective lyrics. The movement began as a reaction to the slick production and limiting structures of the Nashville sound developed by Chet Atkins and other record producers.

==History==
Some country fans consider outlaw country a slightly harder-edged variant of progressive country. The outlaw sound has its roots in blues music, honky tonk music of the 1940s and 1950s, rockabilly of the 1950s, and the evolving genre of rock and roll. Early outlaws were particularly influenced by predecessors such as Bob Wills, Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, and Buddy Holly. A greater transition occurred after Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson were able to secure their own recording rights, and began the trend of bucking the &quot;Nashville sound&quot;. According to Michael Streissguth, author of &quot;Outlaw: Waylon, Willie, Kris, and the Renegades of Nashville&quot;, Jennings and Nelson became outlaws when they &quot;won the right&quot; to record with the producers and studio musicians they preferred.

The 1960s was a decade of enormous change, a change reflected in the music of the time. The Beatles, Brian Wilson, Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones, and many who followed in their wake cast off the traditional role of the recording artist. They wrote their own material, had creative input in their albums, and refused to conform to what society required of its youth. One author states that the Beatnik movement, from the late 1940s to the mid-1960s, was a precursor to outlaw country. Participants in both movements emphasized that they felt &quot;out of place&quot; in mainstream soeciety.

At the same time, country music was declining into a formulaic genre that appeared to offer the establishment what it wanted with artists such as Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton making the kind of music that was anathema to the growing counterculture. While Nashville continued to be the focus of mainstream country music, cities like Lubbock and Austin became the creative centers of outlaw country. Southern rock also had a strong influence on the outlaw country movement, and that sound and style of recording was centered in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. In the Western United States, the Bakersfield sound was providing a counterpoint to the traditional Nashville sound, and the counterculture was also giving rise to the fusion genre of country rock, with groups such as the Flying Burrito Brothers and The First National Band (whose lead singer Michael Nesmith had similar creative rebellion against the West Coast music establishment dating to his time with The Monkees).

===Origin of term===
The movement was named, at various points, &quot;redneck rock&quot;, progressive country, or &quot;armadillo country&quot;, after the animal which would become the movement&#x27;s unofficial mascot, before it was termed &quot;outlaw country&quot;. The origin of the outlaw label is debated. According to Jason Mellard, author of &quot;Progressive Country: How the 1970s Transformed the Texan in Popular Culture&quot;, the term &quot;seems to have sedimented over time rather than exploding in the national consciousness all at once&quot;.

The term is often attributed to &quot;Ladies Love Outlaws&quot;, a song by Lee Clayton and sung by Waylon Jennings on the 1972 album of the same name. Another plausible explanation is the use of the term a year later by publicist Hazel Smith of Glaser Sound Studios to describe the music of Jennings and Tompall Glaser. Art critic Dave Hickey, who wrote a 1974 profile in &quot;Country Music&quot; magazine, also used the term to describe artists who opposed the commercial control of the Nashville recording industry.

In 1976, the outlaw movement solidified the term with the release of &quot;Wanted! The Outlaws&quot;, a compilation album featuring songs sung by Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Jessi Colter, and Tompall Glaser. &quot;Wanted! The Outlaws&quot; became the first country album to be platinum-certified, reaching sales of one million.

===Development===
As Southern rock flourished, veteran country artists incorporated rock into their music in this genre. Songwriters/guitarists such as Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, and Hank Williams, Jr. shed the formulaic Nashville sound, grew long hair, and replaced rhinestone-studded suits with leather jackets. Outlaw country artists spoke openly about smoking marijuana. Fiercely independent, the &quot;outlaws&quot; abandoned lush orchestrations, stripped the music to its country core, and added a rock sensibility to the sound. At the same time, outlaw country performers brought back older styles that had fallen into disuse, such as honky tonk songs and &quot;cowboy ballads&quot;. As well, Nelson and Jennings incorporated more R&amp;B and soul music into their country music by working with Memphis and Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section musicians.

The outlaw country artists aimed to resist the big &quot;machine&quot; of the Nashville establishment, which &quot;codified&quot; norms of sounds, styles, and even appearance and behavior through influential &quot;tastemaker&quot; shows such as Grand Ole Opry. The Grand Ole Opry, which was &quot;staunchly conservative&quot;, used its influence over Nashville&#x27;s Music Row to control who could play and what types of songs they could perform. Jennings described his experience in that city&#x27;s recording industry as like working on an assembly line, in which records were produced like &quot;clockwork&quot;.

In 1973 Jennings produced &quot;Lonesome, On&#x27;ry and Mean&quot;. The theme song was written by Steve Young, a songwriter and performer who never made it in the mainstream, but whose songs helped to create the outlaw style. The follow-up album for Jennings was &quot;Honky Tonk Heroes&quot; and the songwriter hero was Texan Billy Joe Shaver. Like Steve Young, Shaver never made it big, but his 1973 album &quot;Old Five and Dimers Like Me&quot; is considered a country classic in the outlaw genre.

Willie Nelson&#x27;s career as a songwriter in Nashville peaked in the late 1960s. As a songwriter, he had written a number of major pop-crossover hits, including &quot;Crazy&quot; for Patsy Cline and &quot;Hello Walls&quot; for Faron Young, but as a singer, he was getting nowhere. He left Nashville in 1971 to return to Texas. The musicians he met in Austin had been developing the folk and rock influenced country music that grew into the outlaw genre. Performing and associating with the likes of Jerry Jeff Walker, Michael Martin Murphey, and Billy Joe Shaver helped shape his future career.

Williams Jr. had long spent much of his early career in the shadow of his father Hank Williams Sr., who died when Williams Jr. was three years old. In 1975, Williams was severely injured in an avalanche while mountain climbing, disfiguring him to the point where he no longer resembled his father; he grew a beard to hide the scars, which he has maintained ever since. He also began collaborating with the other outlaws, beginning with his album &quot;Hank Williams Jr. and Friends&quot; released shortly before he was injured.

At the same time as Nelson was reinventing himself, other influential musicians were writing songs and playing in Austin and Lubbock. Butch Hancock, Joe Ely, and Jimmie Dale Gilmore formed the Flatlanders, a group that never sold huge numbers of albums, but continues to perform. The three founders have each made a significant contribution to the development of the outlaw genre. The Lost Gonzo Band and their work in conjunction with Jerry Jeff Walker and Michael Murphey were integral in the birth of Outlaw Country.

Other Texans, like Townes Van Zandt, Steve Earle, and Guy Clark, developed the outlaw ethos through their songwriting and ways of living.

Although Johnny Cash spent most of his time in Arkansas and Tennessee, he experienced a revival of his career with the outlaw movement, especially after his live albums &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot; and &quot;At San Quentin&quot;, both of which were recorded in prisons. Cash had working relationships with Nelson, Jennings, and Kris Kristofferson (who considered Cash one of his most influential mentors) in his later career, culminating in the formation of The Highwaymen; the four would record and perform as a supergroup in addition to their solo careers through the late 1990s. Cash had also been on good terms with several folk counterculture figures, a fact that irked Nashville and television executives (Cash hosted a variety show from 1969 to 1971). Like the other outlaw singers, he eschewed the polished Nashville look with a somewhat ragged (especially in later years), all-black outfit that inspired Cash&#x27;s nickname, the &quot;Man in Black&quot;.

Kristofferson, in turn, brought in connections to the Chicago folk scene such as John Prine and Steve Goodman. Prine, in particular, became a close associate of Kristofferson&#x27;s over the years.
===Decline of the movement===
The outlaw movement&#x27;s heyday was in the mid- to late 1970s; although the core artists of the movement continued to record for many years afterward (Nelson, in particular, was recording hits well into the following decade while Hank Williams, Jr. achieved his greatest success during the 1980s), the outlaw movement as a fad was already declining by 1978. By 1980 mainstream country music was practically dominated by country pop artists and crossover acts. The movement was furthermore falling victim to the same pigeonholing and commercialization as mainstream country music; Mickey Newbury, a prominent influence on many outlaw artists, rejected the &quot;outlaw&quot; label, stating &quot;I quit playing cowboys when I grew up.&quot; Williams also noted in his song &quot;All My Rowdy Friends (Have Settled Down)&quot; that many of the core &quot;outlaws&quot; were growing up and abandoning the drugs and hard partying that had driven much of their lives in the 1970s in favor of their home lives and other pursuits. Jennings had a hit song with &quot;Don&#x27;t You Think This Outlaw Bit&#x27;s Done Got Out of Hand&quot; in 1978, which likewise attributed the decline to pressures from drug use. Some of the outlaws would have a slight career renaissance in the mid-1980s with the neotraditional country revival, which revived the older styles of both mainstream and &quot;outlaw&quot; country music of years past.

==Related genres==
The Tulsa sound out of Tulsa, Oklahoma was closely related to outlaw country; &quot;Tulsa Time&quot; became a hit for Don Williams in 1978, and for Eric Clapton (who, though English, was closely associated with the Tulsa sound in the late 1970s and early 1980s) in 1980. The Tulsa sound, in turn, influenced Red Dirt, a genre that arose out of Stillwater, Oklahoma.

<text>A rocket launcher is a weapon that launches an unguided, rocket-propelled projectile.

==History==


The earliest rocket launchers documented in imperial China consisted of arrows modified by the attachment of a rocket motor to the shaft a few inches behind the arrowhead. The rocket was propelled by the burning of the black powder in the motor; these should not be confused with early fire arrows, which were conventional arrows carrying small tubes of black powder as an incendiary that ignited only after the arrow hit its target. The rocket launchers were constructed of wood, basketry, and bamboo tubes. The launchers divided the rockets with frames meant to keep them separated, and the launchers were capable of firing multiple rockets at once. Textual evidence and illustrations of various early rocket launchers are found in the 1510 edition of the &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot; translated by Needham and others at Princeton University. (The original &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot; was compiled between 1040 and 1044 and described the discovery of black powder but preceded the invention of the rocket. Partial copies of the original survived and &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot; was republished in 1231 during the Southern Song dynasty, including military developments since the original 1044 publication. The British scientist, sinologist, historian Joseph Needham asserts that the 1510 edition is the most reliable in its faithfulness to the original and 1231 versions, since it was printed from blocks that were re-carved directly from tracings of the edition made in 1231 AD.) The 1510 &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot; describes the &quot;long serpent&quot; rocket launcher, a rocket launcher constructed of wood and carried with a wheelbarrow, and the &quot;hundred tiger&quot; rocket launcher, a rocket launcher made of wood and capable of firing 320 rocket arrows. The text also describes a portable rocket carrier consisting of a sling and a bamboo tube.

Rocket launchers known as &quot;wasp nest&quot; launchers were used by the Ming dynasty in 1380 and in 1400 by Li Jinglong against Zhu Di.

Rockets were introduced to the West during the Napoleonic Wars; the Congreve rocket was a British weapon devised by Sir William Congreve in 1804 after experiencing Indian rockets at the Siege of Seringapatam (1799). Congreve rockets were launched from an iron trough about 18 inches (45 centimetres) in length, called a &quot;chamber&quot;. These chambers could be fixed to the ground for horizontal launching, secured to a folding copper tripod for high angle fire or mounted on frames on carts or the decks of warships.

The collection of the royal armies includes man portable rocket launchers that appear (based on lock designs) to date from the two decades after 1820. These don&#x27;t appear to have entered general use and no surviving documentation on them has been found.

During the American Civil War, both the US and the Confederate militaries experimented upon and produced rocket launchers. Confederate forces used Congreve rockets in limited uses due to its inaccuracies, while the US forces used Hale patent rocket launcher which fired seven to ten inch rockets with fin stabilizers at a range of .

===World War II===

Pre-war research programmes into military rocket technology by many of the major powers led to the introduction of a number of rocket artillery systems with fixed or mobile launchers, often capable of firing a number of rockets in a single salvo. In the United Kingdom, solid fuel rockets were initially used in the anti-aircraft role; the 7-inch Unrotated Projectile was fired from single pedestal-mounted launchers on warships and a 3-inch version was used by shore based Z Batteries, for which multiple &quot;projectors&quot; were developed. Later developments of these weapons included the Land Mattress multiple launchers for surface-to-surface bombardment and the RP-3 air-to-ground rockets that were launched from rails fitted to fighter bomber aircraft. In Germany, the 15 cm Nebelwerfer 41 was an adaptation of a multiple barrelled smoke mortar for artillery rockets. The Soviet″s &quot;Katyusha&quot; was a self-propelled system, being mounted on trucks, tanks and even trains. The United States Army deployed the tank mounted T34 Calliope system late in the war.

==Types==
===Shoulder-fired===

The rocket launchers category includes shoulder-fired weapons, any weapon that fires a rocket-propelled projectile at a target yet is small enough to be carried by a single person and fired while held on one&#x27;s shoulder. Depending on the country or region, people might use the terms &quot;bazooka&quot; or &quot;RPG&quot; as generalized terms to refer to such weapons, both of which are in fact specific types of rocket launchers. The Bazooka was an American anti-tank weapon which was in service from 1942 to 1957, while the RPG (most commonly the RPG-7) is a Soviet anti-tank weapon.

A smaller variation is the gyrojet, a small arms rocket launcher with ammunition slightly larger than that of a .45-caliber pistol.

Recoilless rifles are sometimes confused with rocket launchers. A recoilless rifle launches its projectile using an explosive powder charge, not a rocket engine, though some such systems have sustainer rocket motors.

===Rocket pod===

A rocket pod is a launcher that contains several unguided rockets held in individual tubes, designed to be used by attack aircraft or attack helicopters for close air support. In many cases, rocket pods are streamlined to reduce aerodynamic drag. The first pods were developed immediately after World War II, as an improvement over the previous arrangement of firing rockets from rails, racks or tubes fixed under the wings of aircraft. Early examples of pod-launched rockets were the US Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket and the French SNEB.

===Large scale===
Larger-scale devices which serve to launch rockets include the multiple rocket launcher, a type of unguided rocket artillery system.

She is best known as a long-term regular panellist on the ITV daytime talk show &quot;Loose Women&quot;, being one of the original panellists from its start in 1999 until 2002, before returning to the show in 2013 after a panellist revamp. She played the role of Gina in the ITV comedy &quot;Second Thoughts&quot; from 1992 to 1994, and Annie Palmer on the BBC One soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; from 1997 to 1999. She has also had minor roles in &quot;The Bill&quot;, &quot;Casualty&quot;, &quot;Benidorm&quot; and &quot;99-1&quot;. Sawalha presented a number of television programmes in the early 2000s, whilst taking a break from &quot;Loose Women&quot;.

Sawalha won the 2007 series of &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot;. She has been cooking with her sister Dina on YouTube since January 2023.

==Early life==
Sawalha was raised and still lives in Croydon, south London. She is the daughter of the Jordanian-born British actor Nadim Sawalha and his English wife Roberta Lane. She is the sister of television actress Julia Sawalha and has appeared on &quot;Lily Savage&#x27;s Blankety Blank&quot; with her. In 1997, the three starred together in &quot;Dearest Daddy... Darling Daughter&quot; at the Young Vic Theatre in South London. However, the family pulled out of the performance after hearing of Nadia&#x27;s husband&#x27;s death.

==Career==
After training at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts, Sawalha began her career in theatre. From 1997 to 1999, she starred in &quot;EastEnders&quot; as businesswoman Annie Palmer.

In 2001, Sawalha presented the short-lived ITV quiz programme &quot;It&#x27;s Not the Answer&quot;, with Peter Dickinson as the announcer.

For the BBC, Sawalha has fronted four series of &quot;Passport to the Sun&quot;, one series each of &quot;Total&quot; , &quot;TV Mail&quot;, &quot;Heir Hunters&quot;, &quot;Perfect Partner&quot; and &quot;Family Exchange&quot;. She was also a co-host on the live documentary &quot;City Hospital&quot;. Sawalha has previously hosted the BBC One show &quot;Living in the Sun&quot;, about British expats living in Spain and &quot;Wanted Down Under&quot;, which shows families who want to make the move Down Under (Australia, occasionally New Zealand) and what it would be like to live and work in those Antipodean nations. She could also be seen on &quot;Accidents Can Happen&quot;, a daytime BBC One programme produced by Twofour, which follows families as they try to rebuild their homes and their lives following disaster.

In 2005, Sawalha presented one series of the BBC One programme &quot;Mirror, Signal, Manoeuvre&quot; which followed learner drivers as they learnt to drive and took their driving tests with varying degrees of success. Sawalha was one of the learner drivers who ended up passing her driving test at the end of the second series. In the same year and on the same network, Sawalha also co-presented with Jeremy Milnes for one series of the programme &quot;Keeping Up with the Joneses&quot;.

In the summer of 2006, Sawalha began co-presenting &quot;The One Show&quot; with Adrian Chiles. However, due to her pregnancy, she did not return to the show in the summer of 2007, and was replaced by Christine Bleakley.

After winning &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot;, Sawalha went on to co-present the children&#x27;s version of the show &quot;Junior Masterchef&quot;, she was said to be &#x27;delighted&#x27; to be given the chance to host the show. From the 2012 series, Sawalha was replaced by Irish cook Donal Skehan.

In 2008, Sawalha returned to BBC One, to present the daytime programme &quot;Wanted Down Under&quot;. She presented the 2009 programme &quot;Eating in the Sun&quot;, produced by her husband Mark Adderley, in which Sawalha is challenged by celebrity chefs to cook in their favourite holiday restaurants.

From 15 February until 20 August 2010, Sawalha presented a series of the reality programme &quot;Instant Restaurant&quot; for BBC Two.

In July 2011, Sawalha guest presented ITV Breakfast programme &quot;Lorraine&quot; and made a total of 17 appearances on the show, as a relief presenter and as a resident chef.

In January 2011, Sawalha starred in the sixth series of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; with Scottish professional Mark Hanretty, but was voted out in a double elimination in the first week, along with Angela Rippon and her partner Sean Rice.

In April 2012, she began co-presenting &quot;Saturday Cookbook&quot; on ITV Breakfast with chef Mark Sargeant. The same year, Sawalha presented the UKTV Home series &quot;Kitchen SOS&quot;.

From 27 October to 29 December 2013, Sawalha and Kaye Adams co-hosted a series of &quot;Sunday Scoop&quot;, a cookery show.

From 7 January 2015, Sawalha took part in the fifteenth series of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; on Channel 5. She lasted 24 days in the house before being evicted.

Sawalha presented her own cookery show, &quot;Nadia&#x27;s Family Feasts&quot; on ITV. She took inspiration from busy households around the world as she searched for new ideas for recipes that would fit into hectic schedules. Each week, she was joined by a guest chef with a passion or expertise in that cuisine. The series lasted one season and was replaced by &quot;John and Lisa&#x27;s Weekend Kitchen&quot;.

Sawalha now hosts a podcast with her husband. In &quot;How to Stay Married (So Far)&quot;, they talk about the ups and downs of married life.

==YouTube==

Sawalha started a YouTube channel with fellow &quot;Loose Women&quot; panellist Kaye Adams. They had their own YouTube account, Instagram account and Facebook page, in which they did weekly vlogs, cooking videos, film and TV programme reviews. They also focused on daily normal family routines as well. This account, however, is now inactive.

Sawalha also launched a Sawalha-Adderley YouTube channel. &quot;The Sawalha-Adderleys&quot; (Originally &quot;Nadia Sawalha and Family&quot;) on Monday 25 August 2014, featuring Sawalha with her husband Mark Adderley. Also regularly appearing are Adderley&#x27;s mother Diane Adderley and Sawalha&#x27;s sister Dina.

The channel began as a film and TV show review in which Sawalha, Adderley and sometimes their children would review films coming out in the cinema, or a popular TV show on television. But by the end of 2014, her family decided to make varied content with the first being Vlogmas where the family do a vlog every day in December. This proved to be a hit with their followers. From 2015 onwards, the channel has been releasing at least two videos daily, but their children no longer appear in their content.

In December 2016, the channel launched a subscription service. It had a monthly cost of £1.99 and included their weekly &quot;The No-Named Sunday show&quot; which features different segments from memes, cooking, newspapers, book reviews, &quot;Teddy Talks&quot;, and an occasional livestream for members only.

In February 2019, the channel reached 50,000 subscribers. On 4 May 2020, the channel reached 100,000 subscribers and received a &quot;silver play button&quot;.

==Personal life==
Sawalha has suffered from psoriasis and has used homeopathy rather than conventional treatment. In 2019, Sawalha revealed on &quot;Loose Women&quot; that she suffers from tinnitus.

On 25 December 1997, Sawalha&#x27;s first husband, Justin Mildwater, ended his life by suicide. They had been married for five years, but had split up a few months before.

On 6 June 2002, she married her second husband, Mark Adderley. The following year, he was caught on the M4 near Chippenham at more than two times over the drink-drive limit. Adderley has been sober following a period of rehabilitation. Both Sawalha and Adderley have discussed his path to sobriety on their YouTube channel. Sawalha is an atheist.

On 31 May 2017, Sawalha spoke in an emotional video online about losing her hair at the age of 52. Sawalha said that her curls were fake and she was going through the perimenopause, the start of the menopause. She said that a doctor told her in September 2016 she had the balding gene.

On 25 November 2022, Sawalha announced on &quot;Loose Women&quot; that she had been diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 58.

In the wake of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war, Sawalha has been an outspoken advocate for Palestine, and a critic of Israel.

<doc id="421025" wikidata="Q243998" url="?curid=421025" title="Bongo drum">
<text>Bongos (Spanish: &quot;bongó&quot;) are an Afro-Cuban percussion instrument consisting of a pair of small open bottomed hand drums of different sizes. The pair consists of the larger &quot;hembra&quot; () and the smaller &quot;macho&quot; (), which are joined by a wooden bridge. They are played with both hands and usually held between the legs, although in some cases, as in classical music, they may be played with sticks or mounted on stands.

Bongos are mainly employed in the rhythm section of son cubano and salsa ensembles, often alongside other drums such as the larger congas and the stick-struck timbales. In these groups, the bongo player is known as &quot;bongosero&quot; and often plays a continuous eight-stroke pattern called &quot;martillo&quot; () as well as more rhythmically free parts, providing improvisatory flourishes and rhythmic counterpoint.

Bongos originated in eastern Cuba at the end of the 19th century, possibly from a pair of larger drums such as the bokú. These older, larger bongos are known as &quot;bongó del monte&quot; and played in changüí. The smaller bongos used in son cubano were popular across Cuba by the 1910s and reached the concert halls of the eastern United States in the 1930s. By the 1940s, bongos and congas were sharing the stage as son ensembles grew in size and Latin music began to cross-pollinate with jazz and other genres. During the second half of the 20th century, bongos began to be played in a wide variety of genres, from bachata to Latin rock.

== Construction ==
Bongo drums are about high and have diameters of approximately and . The shells of the drums and the bridge (the small block that joins them) are usually made of wood, although fiberglass is also common. The heads are typically made of calfskin and attached to the shells via steel hardware that enables their tuning (lug tuning). Originally, metal tacks were used, so the skins had to be tightened by heating the skins with a flame and loosened with water or by striking them vigorously. This method of tuning is still used for the traditional bongos used in changüí. Therefore, Fernando Ortiz places the original bongó in the category of &quot;tambores de candela&quot; (flame-tuned drums), along with bokú, yuka, conga, bembé and smaller drums, since these were all tuned with the flame of an oil lamp.

== Technique ==

Bongo drums produce relatively high-pitched sounds compared to conga drums, and should be held behind the knees with the larger drum on the right when right-handed. It is most often played by hand and is especially associated in Cuban music with a steady pattern or ostinato of eighth-notes known as the &quot;martillo&quot; (hammer). They are traditionally played by striking the edge of the drumheads with the fingers and palms. The glissando used with &quot;bongó de monte&quot;, called &quot;bramido&quot; (howl), is done by rubbing the third finger, supported by the thumb, across the head of the drum. Usually, this is done during the climax of a changüí performance. The finger is sometimes moistened with saliva or sweat before rubbing it across the head, but many players use beeswax instead.

When playing son cubano and other popular genres, the &quot;macho&quot; is on the left and the &quot;hembra&quot; on the right. In changüí, the &quot;bongó de monte&quot; is positioned the opposite way. Playing patterns are also different in changüí, where the &quot;bongó&quot; does not follow a steady beat. Instead, it usually marks offbeats and beat four while improvising. Thus, the playing technique in changüí resembles that of the congas (moreover, their pitch is often lower than both bongos and congas). This reflects it origin, since the &quot;bongó del monte&quot; evolved from pairs of &quot;bokús&quot;, a larger drum from eastern Cuba similar to the conga.

Bongos can also be played on a stand, as is the case with concert orchestras and bands. In classical music performances, bongos are usually struck with mallets or drumsticks. Examples of pieces featuring bongos include &quot;Ionisation&quot; by Varèse (1931), &quot;Le Marteau sans maître&quot; by Boulez (1955) and &quot;In seinem Garten liebt Don Perlimplin Belisa&quot; by Fortner (1962). Steve Reich&#x27;s 1971 piece &quot;Drumming&quot; features four pairs of carefully tuned bongos played with drumsticks.

== History ==

=== Origin and etymology ===

The origin of the bongo is largely unclear. Its use was first documented in the eastern region of Cuba, the Oriente Province, during the late 19th century, where it was employed in music styles such as nengón, changüí, and their descendant, the son cubano. According to Fernando Ortiz, the word &quot;bongó&quot; derived from the Bantu words &quot;mgombo&quot; or &quot;ngoma&quot;, meaning drum. He hypothesizes that the word evolved through metathesis and by similarity with another Bantu word, &quot;mbongo&quot;. According to Ortiz&#x27;s early 20th century informants, the large &quot;bongó del monte&quot; (mountain bongo) used in changüí was the ancestor of the smaller bongó used in son cubano and salsa.

As explained by eastern Cuban informants to Benjamin Lapidus, the oral tradition among changüí musicians in Oriente is that the &quot;bongó&quot; originated as a replacement for pairs of bokús that were slung over the player&#x27;s knee. Bokús are tall drums popular in the eastern provinces, particularly during carnival processions, and featured in early changüí groups. Eventually, these drums were cut in half into bongos. This may explain why the &quot;bongó del monte&quot; used in changüí is larger than the bongos used in son. In Holguín, similar drums which are considered possible ancestors of the &quot;bongó&quot; are known as &quot;tahona&quot;, which might have a been a generic word for drum in Cuba and also refers to an unrelated music genre. Other generic terms that have been used to refer to bongos across eastern Cuba include tahonitas, tambora, atambora and tumba.

The bokú/tahona origin of the bongos agrees with the generally agreed notion held by Afro-Cuban cultural historians that the bongo derives from Bantu drum models from Central Africa, noticeable in the open bottoms. The strong historical presence of Africans from the Congo/Angola region in eastern Cuba (where the bongo first appeared) makes such an influence possible, as does the widespread use of the term bongó/bonkó among Bantu speakers. Moreover, Central African/Congo influences are also documented in both son cubano and changüí, and initially the development of the bongo drum was in parallel with these genres. From such conceptual African drum models, the bongo developed further in Cuba itself, and some historians state that the attaching of the two drums was a later invention that took place in Cuba. Therefore, the instrument has been described as &quot;African in concept but Cuban in invention&quot;. Ortiz&#x27;s hypothesis for the origin of the bokú is that their tall unusual shape was the result of a purposeful avoidance of &quot;African-looking&quot; drums by Afro-Cuban musicians at a time when most drums of that sort were banned.

Less supported hypotheses for the origin of the bongos, largely based on their superficial similarity to other twin drums, include the Cuban pailas and timbales (descended from European tympani), the Arab nakers, the North African tbilat (called &quot;African clay bongos&quot;), the Indian tabla, etc.

=== Evolution and popularization ===

The bongo entered Cuban popular music as a key instrument of early son ensembles, quickly becoming—due to the increasing popularity of the son—&quot;the first instrument with an undeniable African past to be accepted in Cuban “society” circles&quot;. This is attested, for example, in poems by Nicolás Guillén. As son evolved and distanced itself from its precursor, the changüí, so did the bongos. The bongos used in changüí, known as &quot;bongó de monte&quot;, are larger and tuned lower than their modern counterparts, have tack-heads instead of tunable hardware, and play in a manner similar to the lead conga drum (quinto) and other folkloric lead drum parts. Unlike modern son, changüí never extended its popularity beyond eastern Cuba, and hence its bongos remain a rare sight. It is commonly accepted that the son reached Havana partly as a result of the arrival of musicians members of Cuba&#x27;s &quot;ejército permanente&quot; (permanent army), which brought music from eastern Cuba with them. Among the first known &quot;bongoseros&quot; to enlist in the &quot;ejército permanente&quot; in Santiago de Cuba was Mariano Mena.

During the &quot;sexteto&quot; era, son groups began performing and touring more than ever before, and for the first time, recordings were being made. It was in this context that the first great innovators of the bongo made their mark, and unlike their predecessors, their names were not lost in time. Of particular note were Óscar Sotolongo of the Sexteto Habanero and José Manuel Carriera Incharte &quot;El Chino&quot; of the Sexteto Nacional, the two leading groups of the 1920s and &#x27;30s. Sotolongo himself would later leave the Habanero and direct his own group, the Conjunto Típico Cubano. His replacement was Agustín Gutiérrez &quot;Manana&quot;, who is widely considered one of the most influential &quot;bongoseros&quot;, partly due to his condition as an Abakuá member, which allowed him to develop techniques based on the ekué (secret drum) drumming of such society. In 1930, Sotolongo&#x27;s son, Andrés Sotolongo replaced Gutiérrez in the Habanero. Decades later, at 82 years of age, Andrés Sotolongo was recorded for the &quot;Routes of Rhythm&quot; documentary playing alongside Isaac Oviedo.

In 1929, bongos and other drums were banned by the Cuban government. This prohibition extended that of 1925, which outlawed congas in the context of street carnivals, but not the comparsas themselves. Ironically, this original ban was enacted by the mayor of Santiago de Cuba, Desiderio Arnaz II, father of Desi Arnaz, who later popularized congas, bongos and bokús across America and the world. This repression of Afro-Cuban culture was denounced by poets in the Afrocubanismo such as Guillén, whose &quot;Canción del bongó&quot; (Song of the bongo) was published in 1931.

The 1930s saw an increase in the technical skill of &quot;bongoseros&quot;, as evidenced by Clemente &quot;Chicho&quot; Piquero, whose virtuosic performances inspired a young Mongo Santamaría to take up the instrument. By the early 1940s, Santamaría had become a master of the instrument, performing with the Lecuona Cuban Boys, Sonora Matancera, Conjunto Matamoros and Arsenio Rodríguez&#x27;s &quot;Conjunto Segundo&quot; among others. Arsenio had pioneered the &quot;conjunto&quot; format by incorporating a &quot;tumbadora&quot; (conga drum) into the rhythm section and having the &quot;bongosero&quot; double on cowbell. Arsenio&#x27;s long-time &quot;bongosero&quot; was Antolín &quot;Papa Kila&quot; Suárez, who is often cited as one of the greatest of his time along with Pedro Mena of the Conjunto Matamoros. Arsenio&#x27;s group also helped break the barriers of race, which particularly affected &quot;bongoseros&quot;. For example, the Orquesta Casino de la Playa did not allow their black &quot;bongosero&quot; Ramón Castro to perform on stage, nor was Arsenio allowed on the tres. The Casino de la Playa would also feature &quot;bongosero&quot; Cándido Requena, who later joined the Conjunto Kubavana and Conjunto Niágara, and became one of Cuba&#x27;s foremost makers of bongos and &quot;tumbadoras&quot;. Requena, as well as the Vergara brothers, were instrumental in the technological improvement of bongos and congas. Before the advent of mechanically tunable bongos and congas in the 1940s, both instruments used to be tuned with oil or kerosene lamps. The heat of the flame was used to contract the drumhead to achieve the desired sound.

Following the popularization of the &quot;tumbadora&quot;, Santamaría switched to the instrument, while remaining a close friend of &quot;bongosero&quot; Armando Peraza. Both moved to New York by 1950, bringing their music abilities with them. Among the &quot;bongoseros&quot; who stayed in Cuba were the aforementioned Chicho Piquero, who had become a close friend of Benny Moré in Mexico and became his Banda Gigante&#x27;s &quot;bongosero&quot; back in Cuba. Also important during the 1950s were Papa Gofio of the Conjunto Rumbavana and Rogelio &quot;Yeyo&quot; Iglesias, the main bongo player in Havana&#x27;s descarga scene. Over the course of the 20th century, the bongo spread throughout Latin America. In the Dominican Republic, the bongo became integral to bachata, a genre related to bolero that emerged in the 1960s.

=== In the United States ===

In the 1920s, bongos were first played in the United States during the recording sessions of Cuban son ensembles such as Sexteto Nacional, which recorded in New York City for Columbia Records. Among the tracks recorded in their 1927 sessions was &quot;Viva el bongó&quot;, a song about the instrument itself which—unlike the stylized Cuban son popular at the time—brought percussion to the foreground. Since these recordings were mainly sold in Cuba, they did not have any cultural impact in the US.

Things changed one Saturday afternoon in April 1930, when the Havana Casino Orchestra directed by Don Azpiazú debuted their live show at the Palace Theatre in New York. Featuring José &quot;Chiquito&quot; Socarrás on bongos, Don Azpiazú&#x27;s successful performances and recordings of &quot;El manisero&quot; gave rise to a dance craze known as &quot;rhumba&quot; (in reality based on Cuban son) which led to the widespread use of the bongo among Latin bands in New York. In the early 1930s, Cuban orchestras proliferated in New York, featuring the bongo as key percussion instrument, including those directed by Antonio Machín, Alberto Socarrás, Pedro Vía, Antobal, Enrique Bryon, etc. However, apart from Chiquito Socarrás, who was also a singer, there were no &quot;bongoseros&quot; of renown and the instrument did not yet permeate American music styles.

Spearheaded by the iconic &quot;conguero&quot; Chano Pozo, the late 1940s saw an exodus of Afro-Cuban percussionists from Cuba to the United States. Among the leading &quot;bongoseros&quot; of Cuban origin in the United States were Armando Peraza, Chino Pozo (unrelated to Chano) and Rogelio Darias, who had a long career in Las Vegas and was known as the King of the Bongo. Many others, however, would become primarily conga players, such as Mongo Santamaría, Sabú Martínez and Cándido Camero.

The Latin music scene of New York, and the US in general, was primarily constituted by Puerto Ricans, and many influential &quot;bongoseros&quot; were Puerto Ricans who learned from Cubans. An early example is Rafael &quot;Congo&quot; Castro, who arrived in New York in 1924 and had a long career as a &quot;bongosero&quot; in Chicago until the 1980s. In New York, many Puerto Rican &quot;bongoseros&quot; would go on to join the pioneering Afro-Cuban jazz ensembles of the time such as Machito and his Afro-Cubans, whose singles &quot;Tangá&quot; and &quot;Mango mangüé&quot;—considered the first examples of the genre—featured José Mangual Sr. &quot;Buyú&quot; on bongos. Mangual&#x27;s prolific career was continued by his sons José Mangual Jr. and Luis Mangual, who played in a variety of salsa groups in the 1970s. The two biggest Latin orchestras of the 1950s in New York, led by Tito Puente and Tito Rodríguez, were home to two generations of &quot;bongoseros&quot; represented by Johnny &quot;La Vaca&quot; Rodríguez and his son Johnny &quot;Dandy&quot; Rodríguez, of Puerto Rican ancestry.

Other Puerto Rican musicians who made a name for themselves on the bongos were Richie Bastar of El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico, Ralph Marzán of Johnny Pacheco&#x27;s charanga, &quot;Little&quot; Ray Romero, Frank Colón and Roberto Roena. On the other hand, American master &quot;bongoseros&quot; include Jack Costanzo and Willie Bobo (of Puerto Rican origin), the latter more active on timbales. Other &quot;bongoseros&quot; who had more impact as &quot;timbaleros&quot; were Manny Oquendo, Orestes Vilató and Nicky Marrero. American novelty rock acts such as Preston Epps and Michael Viner&#x27;s Incredible Bongo Band capitalized on the popularity of the instrument as well as its exotic and rhythmic qualities.

<text>John Fitzalan II (1223–1267), Lord of Oswestry, Clun, and Arundel, was an English nobleman and Marcher Lord with lands in the Welsh Marches.

==Family==
The son and heir of John Fitzalan, Lord of Oswestry and Clun, from Shropshire. His mother was Isabel, the daughter of William d&#x27;Aubigny, 3rd Earl of Arundel by his wife, Mabel of Chester. John obtained possession of his paternal estates on 26 May 1244, aged 21 years.

After the death of his mother&#x27;s childless brother Hugh d&#x27;Aubigny, 5th Earl of Arundel, he inherited &quot;jure matris&quot; the castle and honour of Arundel in 1243, by which, according to Henry VI&#x27;s &quot;admission&quot; of 1433, he was later retrospectively held to have become &quot;de jure&quot; Earl of Arundel. He was never styled as such during his lifetime, however.

== Welsh conflicts ==

In 1257, Welsh Lord Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn, in the southern realm of the Kingdom of Powys, sought the aid of the Lord of Oswestry against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. John Fitzalan was a surviving member of the English force that was defeated at the hands of the Welsh at Cymerau (near Nantgaredig) in Carmarthenshire.

In 1258, he was one of the key English military commanders in the Welsh Marches and was summoned yet again in 1260 for further conflict against the Welsh. John vacillated in the conflicts between Henry III and the Barons. He fought on the King&#x27;s side at the Battle of Lewes in 1264, where he was taken prisoner. From 1278 to 1282, his sons were engaged in Welsh border hostilities, attacking the lands of Llywelyn.

He is buried at Haughmond Abbey in Shropshire.

== Marriage ==
He married Maud de Verdon, daughter of Theobald le Botiller (Boteler) by his wife Rohesia de Verdon &quot;alias&quot; Rohese (daughter of Nicholas de Verdun and Clemence); by whom he had children including:
*John Fitzalan III, eldest son and heir.
*Joan FitzAlan (c. 1267after 6 October 1316), wife of Sir Richard of Cornwall (died 1296), an illegitimate son of Richard of England, 1st Earl of Cornwall and King of the Romans (1209–1272) (the second son of King John (1199–1216)) by his mistress Joan de Bath (&quot;alias&quot; de Valletort).

<doc id="421034" wikidata="Q434909" url="?curid=421034" title="Mike Krzyzewski">
<text>Michael William Krzyzewski ( , ; born February 13, 1947), nicknamed &quot;Coach K&quot;, is an American former college basketball coach. He served as the head coach at Duke University from 1980 to 2022, during which he led the Blue Devils to five national titles, 13 Final Fours (the most of any coach in men&#x27;s basketball), 15 ACC tournament championships, and 13 ACC regular season titles. Among men&#x27;s college basketball coaches, only UCLA&#x27;s John Wooden has won more NCAA championships (10). Krzyzewski is widely regarded as one of the greatest college basketball coaches of all time.

Krzyzewski has also coached the United States national team, which he led to gold medals at the 2008, 2012, and 2016 Olympics. He was the head coach of the U.S. team that won gold medals at the 2010 and the 2014 FIBA World Cup, and an assistant coach for the &quot;Dream Team&quot; at the 1992 Olympics.

Krzyzewski was a point guard at Army from 1966 to 1969 under coach Bob Knight. From 1975 to 1980, he was the head coach for his alma mater. He is a two-time inductee into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, in 2001 for his individual coaching career and in 2010 as part of the collective induction of the &quot;Dream Team.&quot; He was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006, and the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2009 (with the &quot;Dream Team&quot;).

On November 15, 2011, Krzyzewski led Duke to a 74–69 victory over Michigan State at Madison Square Garden to become the coach with the most wins in NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball history. Krzyzewski&#x27;s 903rd victory set a new record, breaking that held by his former coach, Bob Knight. On January 25, 2015, Duke defeated St. John&#x27;s, 77–68, again at Madison Square Garden, as Krzyzewski became the first Division I men&#x27;s coach to reach 1,000 wins.

==Early life==
Krzyzewski was born in Chicago, the son of Polish American parents Emily M. (née Pituch) and William Krzyzewski and was raised as a Catholic. Krzyzewski attended St. Helen Catholic School in Ukrainian Village, Chicago and, later, Archbishop Weber High School in Chicago, a Catholic prep school for boys.

He was captain of the Army basketball team in his senior season, 1968–69, leading the Cadets to the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) at Madison Square Garden in New York City, where West Point finished fourth.

From 1969 to 1974, Krzyzewski served as an officer in the U.S. Army and directed service teams for three years. In 2005, he was presented West Point&#x27;s Distinguished Graduate Award.

== Education ==
He graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1969. He comes from a working-class family and is a first-generation college student.

==Coaching career==

===Indiana and Army===
He was discharged from active duty in 1974 with the rank of captain, and started his coaching career as an assistant on Knight&#x27;s staff with the Indiana Hoosiers during their historic 1974–75 season. After one year with Indiana, Krzyzewski returned to West Point as head coach at age 28; in his five seasons, he led the Army Cadets to a record and an NIT berth in 1978.

===Duke===

On March 18, 1980, Krzyzewski was named the head coach at Duke University after five seasons at Army. After a few rebuilding seasons, he and the Blue Devils became a fixture on the national basketball scene with 35 NCAA Tournament berths in the past 36 years and 24 consecutive from 1996 to 2019, behind Kansas which has appeared in the tournament in 30 consecutive seasons. Overall, he has taken his program to postseason play in 36 of his 39 years at Duke and is the most winning active coach in men&#x27;s NCAA Tournament play with a 100–30 record for a .769 winning percentage. His Duke teams have won 15 ACC Championships, been to 13 Final Fours, and won five NCAA tournament National Championships.

Krzyzewski had surgery to repair a ruptured disk in his back in October 1994, but insisted on returning to the sidelines for the 1994–95 season, using a special stool to keep him off his feet. However, the pain became so debilitating that he went several days without sleeping early in the season. By the start of ACC play, the pain had progressed to a point that he could not continue. Shortly after the first game of ACC play, Krzyzewski told his players and coaches that he was taking a leave of absence, with longtime assistant Pete Gaudet serving as interim head coach for the remainder of the season. He had actually planned to resign, but athletic director Tom Butters persuaded him to take a leave of absence instead. Per longstanding NCAA guidance, Duke only credits the first 12 games of the season to Krzyzewski and credits the remainder of the season to Gaudet. Years later, Krzyzewski said that he probably would have been out of basketball if he had not endured that season, since it made him realize he needed to manage his time better and delegate more responsibility.

On February 13, 2010 – his 63rd birthday – Krzyzweski coached in his 1,000th game as the Duke head coach. On March 20, 2011, Krzyzewski won his 900th game, becoming the second of three Division I men&#x27;s basketball coaches to reach 900 basketball wins, the other two being Jim Boeheim at Syracuse and his head coach at Army, Bob Knight. On November 15, 2011, Krzyzewski got his 903rd win passing Knight&#x27;s record for most Division I wins. In an interview of both men on ESPN the previous night, Krzyzewski discussed the leadership skills he learned from Knight and the United States Military Academy. Knight credited Krzyzewski&#x27;s understanding of himself and his players as keys to his success over the years.

On January 25, 2015, Krzyzewski won his 1,000th game, when Duke defeated St. John&#x27;s in Madison Square Garden. He is the first men&#x27;s coach to win 1,000 NCAA Division I basketball games.

On April 6, 2015, Krzyzewski won his fifth NCAA championship, when Duke defeated Wisconsin in the title game.

Winning against Yale in the 2016 NCAA tournament on March 19, Krzyzewski became the all-time winningest coach in the NCAA Division I tournament with 90 total wins.

On November 11, 2017, Krzyzewski won his 1,000th game with the Duke Blue Devils, making him the first head coach to win 1,000 games with one NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball program.

On March 17, 2018, Krzyzewski won his 1,099th game in his career, passing Pat Summitt for most wins by a Division I coach, male or female.

On February 16, 2019, Krzyzewski won his 1,123rd game to become the winningest coach in college basketball history at any level (men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s), passing Harry Statham of Division II McKendree University. However, on January 21, 2024, Tara VanDerveer became the winningest head coach in college basketball history at any level, men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s, upon passing Krzyzewski with her 1,203rd win.

On June 2, 2021, Krzyzewski announced that he would retire at the conclusion of the 2021–22 season. Krzyzewski coached his final home game on March 5, 2022, against rival North Carolina, where Duke lost 94–81. Krzyzewski reached his 13th Final Four appearance, passing John Wooden for the most Final Four appearances as a coach, where Duke lost 81–77 to North Carolina in his final game on April 2, 2022. He ended his career at Duke with a 1,129–309 win-loss record.

On April 5, 2022, former Duke player Jay Williams theorized that Krzyzewski could return for another season, but Krzyzewski quickly put that theory to rest when he said he was not going to &quot;pull a Tom Brady&quot; on ESPNU Radio.

===National team===

Krzyzewski&#x27;s teams won three consecutive gold medals in the Olympics with him as head coach of the USA men&#x27;s national team. His other international coaching accolades include a silver medal at the 1987 World University Games, a bronze medal at the 1990 FIBA World Championship, a silver medal at the 1990 Goodwill Games, a bronze medal at the 2006 FIBA World Championship, and gold medals at the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship, the 2010 FIBA World Championship, and the 2014 FIBA World Cup.

He was also an assistant coach for USA teams that won gold medals at the 1984 and 1992 Olympics, 1979 Pan American Games, and 1992 Tournament of the Americas.

In 2005, he was appointed coach of the national team through the 2008 Olympics. In the 2006 FIBA World Championship, the USA won the bronze medal after losing in the semifinals to Greece, then beating defending Olympic gold medalist Argentina for third place.

On August 24, 2008, Krzyzewski&#x27;s U.S. team won the gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. &quot;The Redeem Team&quot; finished the tournament with a perfect 8–0 record. He coached the U.S. team for the 2010 FIBA World Championship and led Team USA to a perfect 9–0 record, defeating host Turkey in the gold medal game, 81–64. His team won a second Olympic gold in London, defeating runners-up Spain, 107–100. Krzyzewski has amassed a total record of 75–1 (.987) as head coach of the USA National Team.

In February 2013, Krzyzewski stepped down after seven years of coaching the national team, but Team USA in May announced that he would return as head coach from 2013 through 2016.

===NBA coaching offers===

During his long tenure at Duke, Krzyzewski had been given the opportunity to coach in the NBA at least five times. The first time came after the 1990 season when he led the Blue Devils to their third straight Final Four appearance. The Boston Celtics offered a coaching position to Krzyzewski, but he soon declined their offer. The next season, Krzyzewski proceeded to lead the Blue Devils to the first of two straight national championships. In 1994, he was pursued by the Portland Trail Blazers, but again he chose to stay with Duke. In 2004, Krzyzewski was also interviewed by the Los Angeles Lakers following the departure of high-profile coach Phil Jackson. He was given a formal offer from Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak, reportedly for five years, $40 million and part ownership, but again turned down the NBA. In 2010, the New Jersey Nets were reportedly willing to pay Krzyzewski between $12 million and $15 million per season to coach the Nets. Krzyzewski again declined the offer and stayed at Duke. In 2011, Krzyzewski was offered the vacant coaching position for the Minnesota Timberwolves, but he again declined the offer and chose to stay at Duke.

==Post-retirement==
Although Krzyzewski retired as Duke&#x27;s basketball coach in 2022, he maintained a position at Duke University and continued to use his office in the Schwartz-Butters Athletic Center. As of 2023, he said he talked to successor coach Jon Scheyer on a near-daily basis. According to &quot;The Athletic&quot;, Krzyzewski&#x27;s post-retirement focuses included charity work for The V Foundation and the Emily Krzyzewski Center, speaking gigs, and time with family. He made his first post-retirement appearance at a Duke game on February 14, 2023.

==Family and charity==

Krzyzewski married his wife, Carol &quot;Mickie&quot; Marsh, in the Catholic chapel at West Point on the day of his graduation in 1969. They have three daughters and ten grandchildren. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal,&quot; she was the only person who could persuade him to step down during the 1994–95 season when he was suffering from a ruptured disk. She actually went as far as to give her husband an ultimatum–if he wanted to come home on what would prove to be his final day of coaching that season, he needed to skip practice and go to the doctor. His grandson, Michael Savarino, was a walk-on player at Duke for the 2019–20 season.

Krzyzewski and his family founded the Emily Krzyzewski Center, a non-profit organization affiliated with Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in Durham, which was established in 2006 and named in honor of Krzyzewski&#x27;s mother. The mission is to inspire students from kindergarten to high school to dream big, act with character and purpose, and reach their potential as leaders in their community. The center&#x27;s K to College Model serves academically focused students in out-of-school programming designed to help them achieve in school, gain entry to college, and break the cycle of poverty in their families. Krzyzewski and his wife, Mickie, have also been active for years in fundraising and support for the Duke Children&#x27;s Hospital, Children&#x27;s Miracle Network, the V Foundation for Cancer Research. In all of those entities they have both served as chairs and/or led major fundraising efforts. In addition, the Krzyzewskis have been major donors to Duke University in supporting a number of areas, including establishing scholarship endowments for students in North and South Carolina as well as a Duke student-athlete every year. He also serves on the board of advisors of the Code of Support Foundation, a nonprofit military services organization.

In 2012, Krzyzewski received the U.S. Basketball Writers Association&#x27;s Wayman Tisdale Humanitarian Award honoring his civic service and charitable efforts in making a significant positive impact on society.

<text>Willy Otto Oskar Ley (October 2, 1906 – June 24, 1969) was a German and American science writer and proponent of cryptozoology. The crater Ley on the far side of the Moon is named in his honor.

==Early life and Berlin years==
Willy Otto Oskar Ley was the son of Julius Otto Ley, a traveling merchant, and Frida May, the daughter of a Lutheran sexton. Ley grew up in his native Berlin during the First World War under the supervision of two aunts. When war erupted, his father was in Great Britain, and consequently he spent the remainder of the war at a detention camp on the Isle of Man. Meanwhile, his mother worked as milliner in a distant city in Germany.

As Ley later recalled he &quot;grew up, so to speak, in the shadow of the Museum of Natural History in Berlin&quot;. When his school teacher asked him to compose an essay on the subject &quot;What Do I Want to Be When I Am Grown and Why?&quot;, Ley responded: &quot;I want to be an explorer.&quot; His teacher thought this silly, but Ley was unconvinced.

At the University of Berlin, he studied astronomy, physics, zoology, and paleontology. Ley explained, &quot;I was never quite sure whether my studies would earn me the title of &#x27;zoologist&#x27; or &#x27;geologist&#x27;, but I kept exploring, in a manner of speaking, looking especially into such corners as others had neglected.&quot; He then became interested in spaceflight after reading Hermann Oberth&#x27;s book &quot;Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen&quot; (The Rocket into Interplanetary Space). Although it was a difficult technical book, Ley worked through the calculations and concluded that outer space would soon become the next great frontier of human exploration. 

Ley was so convinced by Oberth&#x27;s book that he sat down at the age of 19 to write a popularization of its contents. He also began corresponding with every known rocket enthusiast in Europe, including Oberth himself. After publishing &quot;Die Fahrt ins Weltall&quot; (Travel in Outer Space) in 1926, Ley became one of the first members of Germany&#x27;s amateur rocket group, the &quot;Verein für Raumschiffahrt&quot; (VfR – &quot;Spaceflight Society&quot;) in 1927 and wrote extensively for its journal, &quot;Die Rakete&quot; (The Rocket). Ley would eventually become the group&#x27;s Vice-President during a time when it had no active President. Meanwhile, he was writing hundreds of short articles about rockets for German and foreign newspapers.

Due to the influence of Ley and other popular science writers, such as Max Valier, Germans witnessed a short-lived &quot;rocketry fad&quot; in Berlin. From exhibits at public locations to large spectator events, such as Fritz von Opel&#x27;s rocket-car stunts, the German public was excited about both the future possibilities of space travel and the potential for new &quot;weapons of wonder&quot; that could revive the German Empire.

The &quot;rocketry fad&quot; culminated with Fritz Lang&#x27;s 1929 film &quot;Die Frau im Mond&quot; (&quot;Woman in the Moon&quot;), which became the first realistic depiction of spaceflight in cinematic history. Although Oberth is often credited as the main technical consultant to the film, Ley&#x27;s role was of central importance. Oberth was tasked with building a small rocket to be launched at the film&#x27;s premiere. This project never materialized. However, Ley&#x27;s work on the movie did. As director Fritz Lang later recalled, &quot;The work he had done as consultant and advisor ... was amazing. The models of the spaceship, really a highly advanced model of a rocket, the trajectories and the orbits of the modular capsule from the earth, around the earth and to the moon and back ... were so accurate that in 1937 the Gestapo confiscated not only all models of the spaceship but also all foreign prints of the picture.&quot;

Despite the many successes the &quot;rocketry fad&quot; could not be sustained during the early years of the Great Depression. The German public lost interest amidst economic turmoil. Meanwhile, some rocket researchers formed closer ties with the military, which greatly expanded under the leadership of Wernher von Braun. With the collapse of the VfR, the rise of a culture of necessary secrecy and the loss of public enthusiasm, Ley grew discouraged. He continued to write articles for the domestic and foreign press while he stayed in touch with close friends. Yet for the most part, Ley turned back to his original scientific interests, while writing a biography of Conrad Gessner (the &quot;father&quot; of modern zoology). To make ends meet, Ley also worked as a clerk and then manager at a Berlin bank.

When the Nazis seized power, Ley&#x27;s situation became increasingly desperate. He was horrified by National Socialism, its ideology and its style of violent politics. His perception of political events can be inferred from a short science fiction story &quot;Fog&quot;, which Ley wrote in 1940 under the pen name of Robert Wiley. It is a biographical narrative about an office manager dealing with the everyday effects of totalitarianism. Although the story is set in New York City during a failed Communist revolution, it is clear that Ley is retelling his personal experiences in Berlin. In fact, John Campbell, the editor of &quot;Astounding&quot;, requested that Ley center the narrative on his personal experience. Ley not only disliked the irrational nature of German politics, but he also associated the Nazis with the rise of &quot;Pseudo-science&quot;. To make matters worse, Ley had an established reputation as an international scientist, who openly shared and popularized technical information about rocketry, while his articles continued to be republished by foreign newspapers throughout 1934.

In January 1935, Ley used company stationery to write a letter that authorized his vacation in London. Carrying only his favorite books, a few changes of clothing and travel documentation, Ley fled Germany for the United Kingdom and ultimately the United States.

==In the United States==


In 1936, he supervised operations of two rocket planes carrying mail at Greenwood Lake, New York. Ley was an avid reader of science fiction, and began publishing scientific articles in American science fiction magazines, beginning with &quot;The Dawn of the Conquest of Space&quot; in the March 1937 issue of &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;. In the magazine&#x27;s February 1937 issue, he had published a science fiction short story &quot;At the Perihelion&quot; under the pseudonym Robert Wiley, which was later reprinted as &quot;A Martian Adventure&quot; in the 1962 anthology &quot;Great Science Fiction by Scientists&quot; (Collier Books, Groff Conklin, ed.). He was a member of science fiction fandom as well, attending science fiction conventions, and was eventually a Guest of Honor at Philcon II, the 1953 World Science Fiction Convention.

In 1940 Ley joined the staff of &quot;PM&quot;. In the winter of 1941 he met the paper&#x27;s fitness columnist and model, Olga Feldmann (1912–2001). They became engaged on December 11 and married on Christmas Eve.

His book &quot;Rockets – the Future of Travel Beyond the Stratosphere&quot; (1944) describes the early rockets at VfR and more futuristic projects to reach the moon using a 3-stage rocket &quot;as high as of the Empire State Building&quot; — a very good estimate of the height of the Saturn V rocket designed 20 years later. His works from the 1940s, 50s and &#x27;60s are regarded as classics of popular science and include &quot;The Conquest of Space&quot; 1949 (with Chesley Bonestell), &quot;The Conquest of the Moon&quot; (with Wernher von Braun and Fred Whipple, 1953), and &quot;Beyond the Solar System&quot; (1964). His book, &quot;Rockets, Missiles, and Space Travel&quot;, (1957) was cited in the &quot;Space Handbook: Astronautics and its Applications&quot;, a staff report of the Select Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration of the U.S. House of Representatives, which provided non-technical information about spaceflight to U.S. policy makers. 

Ley had a regular science column called &quot;For Your Information&quot; in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; from March 1952 until his death. Ley participated in &quot;Man in Space&quot;, a 1955 episode of &quot;Disneyland&quot; which explained spaceflight to a large television audience. Fellow &quot;Galaxy&quot; columnist Floyd C. Gale wrote that Ley &quot;has become as familiar to TV audiences as Howdy Doody&quot;. 

In the late 1950s, he designed for Monogram models a range of space vehicles. The kits included informational booklets on space travel written by Ley. He also consulted for the Tom Corbett, Space Cadet series of children&#x27;s science fiction books and TV series, as well as the 1959 feature film entitled &quot;The Space Explorers&quot;. Robert A. Heinlein honored him by mentioning a future &quot;Leyport&quot; on the Moon in his 1952 juvenile novel &quot;The Rolling Stones.&quot; Likewise and long after his death, Larry Niven and Steven Barnes named a future Space Shuttle the “Willy Ley” in their 1982 novel &quot;The Descent of Anansi&quot;.

In 1954, Ley wrote &quot;Engineers&#x27; Dreams&quot; in which he discussed &#x27;Seven Future Wonders of the World&#x27;. These included accurate predictions of the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France and commercial wind, solar and geothermal power. Other schemes were less practical: damming the River Jordan to provide power and irrigation to Israel/Palestine and the plans of fellow German Herman Sörgel to drain the Mediterranean to link Europe with Africa and create the new continent of Atlantropa.

He was a member of the all-male literary banqueting club the Trap Door Spiders, which served as the basis of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s fictional group of mystery solvers the Black Widowers.

Ley died at the age of 62 on June 24, 1969 – less than a month before men first landed on the Moon – in his home in Jackson Heights, Queens, where he had lived with his family since the mid-1950s.

==Cryptozoology==
Ley was best known for his books on rocketry and related topics, but he also wrote a number of books about cryptozoology, a pseudoscience. In 1949, Ley published an article &quot;Do Prehistoric Monsters Still Exist?&quot; which popularised the living dinosaur idea and included a discussion on the Mokele-mbembe legend. Ley collected much source material on anomalous animals for his writings. Science historian Brian Regal has noted that Ley &quot;copied entire chapters of Heuvelmans&#x27;s &quot;On the Track of Unknown Animals&quot; for his own reference.&quot;

<text>Cliff Johnson (born 1953) is an American game designer, best known for the puzzle video games &quot;The Fool&#x27;s Errand&quot; (1987) and &quot;3 in Three&quot; (1990). Both games use visual puzzles and a metapuzzle structure. Both won &quot;GAMES Magazine&quot;″s Best Puzzle Game of the Year.

== Biography ==
Johnson was born August 14, 1953, in Hanover, New Hampshire, the only child of Norman and Leatrice Johnson. He attended Bristol Eastern High School in Connecticut, where he started making Super 8 movies. In 1972, he had jobs &quot;building monsters&quot; for five different amusement parks. He later attended University of Southern California&#x27;s film school, where he became a teaching assistant in animation and created some of the Monty Pythonesque animations for Nickelodeon&#x27;s television series &quot;Out of Control&quot;.

In 1984, using his first computer, a Macintosh 512K, he learned to program and created the game &quot;The Fool&#x27;s Errand&quot;, which in 1987 won &quot;Best Puzzle Game of the Year&quot; from &quot;GAMES Magazine&quot; and was declared &quot;Best Retro Game Ever&quot; by British &quot;GamesTM&quot; magazine.)

From 1990 to 1995, he directed the &quot;*FunHouse*&quot; production group for Philips Media, and from 1996 to 2001, he consulted with Mattel, Warner Bros. and Disney for online puzzles and treasure hunts.

In 2002, Johnson designed a $100,000 Challenge for the book &quot;Mysterious Stranger&quot; by street magician David Blaine. It was solved in 2004.

<text>Ustad Alla Rakha Qureshi (29 April 1919 – 3 February 2000) was an Indian tabla player who specialised in Hindustani classical music. Widely revered as one of history&#x27;s most iconic players of the tabla, he was a frequent accompanist of sitar player Pandit Ravi Shankar and was largely responsible for introducing tabla to the Western audience.

==Personal life and education==
Allah Rakha Qureshi was born on 29 April 1919 in Ghagwal village in the Jammu Province of the princely kingdom of Jammu and Kashmir under British Raj; today located in the Samba District of the union territory of the same name in India. His mother tongue was Dogri and his family were Muslim Dogras, although most of the Dogra clan around them were Hindus. Growing up on a farm, Ustad Alla Rakha was always in awe of music, praising the travelling musicians he would occasionally have the opportunity to witness. His father, at that time, looked down upon singing or learning to play a musical instrument as a profession for his boy, due to his family&#x27;s origins as Dogras of Jammu.

At the age of 12, Ustad Alla Rakha ran away from home to stay with his uncle in the nearby Gurdaspur city to pursue his passion for music. Finding little chances for grooming and appreciation, the determined young lad began his training in tabla with Mian Kader Baksh of the Punjab gharana of tabla players. Mian Kadir Bakhsh, who had no sons, formally adopted Alla Rakha and called him the next head of the Punjab gharana of tabla players (a &#x27;gharana&#x27; is a community of musicians sharing a distinctive musical style).

Alla Rakha also took vocal training in classical music and &quot;Raag Vidya&quot; under Ustad Ashiq Ali Khan of the Patiala gharana. His regimen of practice and dedication were legendary: hours upon hours of hard, disciplined practice, that would later pay off. He performed at All India Radio in Lahore as a staff artist in 1936 and was later transferred to All India Radio in Bombay in 1938. In 1943, he quit that job and started working for the Bombay film industry, also known as Bollywood these days, and composed music for nearly two dozen Urdu/Hindi and Punjabi films. By 1958, he had become disillusioned with the film industry and started focusing more on classical music.

He was married to his cousin Bavi Begum and the couple had three sons, Zakir Hussain, Fazal Qureshi and Taufiq Qureshi; two daughters, Khurshid Aulia née Qureshi and Razia; and nine grandchildren. They all survived him except Razia; it was the news of her death a day earlier that is thought to have caused his fatal heart attack.

Allah Rakha had a third daughter named Roohi Bano (1951–2019) who was born in Pakistan and achieved a &quot;legendary&quot; status in television and film acting in that country.

==Career==
Ustad Alla Rakha began his career as an accompanist in Lahore and then as an All India Radio, Delhi staffer in 1936 but later moved to Bombay in 1940, playing the station&#x27;s first ever tabla solo and elevating the instrument&#x27;s position in the process. Soon after, he also started composing music for Hindi films under the name A. R. Qureshi. He composed for a total of 23 films between 1943 and 1964.
However, he still played as an accompanist, for soloists like Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Allauddin Khan, Vilayat Khan, Vasant Rai, Ali Akbar Khan, and Ravi Shankar. The venerable master achieved world renown as Shankar&#x27;s chief accompanist during his apex in the 1960s, delighting audiences in the West with his percussive wizardry, not only as an uncanny accompanist with flawless timing and sensitivity but also as a soloist where he was a master of improvisation, a prolific composer and an electric showman.

His musical partnership with Ravi Shankar was particularly successful and lasted nearly three decades, and their legendary and spellbinding performances at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 and the Woodstock Festival in 1969 served to introduce classical Indian music to general worldwide audiences.

Alla Rakha also was a devoted music teacher. He founded &#x27;Alla Rakha Institute of Music&#x27; in Mumbai in 1985.

==Global influence==
Alla Rakha popularised the art of tabla, playing across the globe, elevating the status and respect of this instrument. &quot;Abbaji&quot; (as he was affectionately known by his disciples) also bridged the gap between Carnatic music and Hindustani music by playing with both renowned Carnatic musicians and other Hindustani stalwarts. Ravi Shankar and Alla Rakha duo represented India at several international music festivals.

Leading American percussionists in rock n&#x27; roll, such as the Grateful Dead&#x27;s Mickey Hart, admired him and studied his technique, benefiting greatly even from single meetings. Hart, a published authority on percussion in world music, said: &quot;Allah Rakha is the Einstein, the Picasso; he is the highest form of rhythmic development on this planet.&quot; Rakha also collaborated with jazz drummer Buddy Rich on their 1968 album &quot;Rich à la Rakha&quot;.

Alla Rakha&#x27;s partnership with Ravi Shankar began in the early 1950s. He was part of the ensemble accompanying Ravi Shankar during George Harrison&#x27;s Concert for Bangladesh shows, held in New York City in August 1971. The success of the live album and concert film from this event presented Indian classical music to a wide audience in the West. He also collaborated and shared the stage with many leading figures in Indian music like sitar player Vilayat Khan and sarod player Ali Akbar Khan.

He was also featured in a Google doodle on 29 April 2014, on the occasion of his 95th birthday.

==Awards and recognition==
* Alla Rakha was awarded the Padma Shri in 1977
* Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1982.

==Death and legacy==
Qureshi died on 3 February 2000 at his Simla House residence on Nepean Sea Road following a heart attack, which he suffered on learning of the death of his daughter, Razia, the previous evening during cataract surgery.

In his obituary, The New York Times called him &quot;the most important tabla drummer of his generation&quot;. The newspaper further stated that Alla Rakha was given the title Ustad or master musician and teacher of the art of tabla playing. Alla Rakha... &quot;used his skill to invigorate every musician who shared the stage with him.&quot;

The Then-Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee also issued a formal statement regretting the loss in his death.

<doc id="421044" wikidata="Q39532" url="?curid=421044" title="IPX/SPX">
<text>IPX/SPX stands for Internetwork Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange. IPX and SPX are networking protocols used initially on networks using the (since discontinued) Novell NetWare operating systems. They also became widely used on networks deploying Microsoft Windows LANs, as they replaced NetWare LANs, but are no longer widely used. IPX/SPX was also widely used prior to and up to Windows XP, which supported the protocols, while later Windows versions do not, and TCP/IP took over for networking.

==Protocol layers==
IPX and SPX are derived from Xerox Network Systems&#x27; IDP and SPP protocols respectively. IPX is a network-layer protocol (layer 3 of the OSI model), while SPX is a transport-layer protocol (layer 4 of the OSI model). The SPX layer sits on top of the IPX layer and provides connection-oriented services between two nodes on the network. SPX is used primarily by client–server applications.

IPX and SPX both provide connection services similar to TCP/IP, with the IPX protocol having similarities to Internet Protocol, and SPX having similarities to TCP. IPX/SPX was primarily designed for local area networks (LANs) and is a very efficient protocol for this purpose (typically SPX&#x27;s performance exceeds that of TCP on a small LAN, as in place of congestion windows and confirmatory acknowledgements, SPX uses simple NAKs). TCP/IP has, however, become the de facto standard protocol. This is in part due to its superior performance over wide area networks and the Internet (which uses IP exclusively), and also because TCP/IP is a more mature protocol, designed specifically with this purpose in mind.

Despite the protocols&#x27; association with NetWare, they are neither required for NetWare communication (as of NetWare 5.x), nor exclusively used on NetWare networks. NetWare communication requires an NCP implementation, which can use IPX/SPX, TCP/IP, or both, as a transport.

==Implementations==
Novell was largely responsible for the use of IPX as a popular computer networking protocol due to their dominance in the network operating system software market (with Novell Netware) from the late 1980s through the mid-1990s.

===DOS===
Novell&#x27;s original NetWare client was written for DOS. Initial versions required a hard-linked protocol stack, where a separate executable would be created by the network administrator for each network card configuration on the network. This executable would be loaded at boot time and remain resident in memory until the system was shut down. Later implementations allowed the network stack to be loaded and unloaded dynamically, using pre-existing modules. This greatly simplified maintenance of client workstations on the network.

IPX/SPX was the de facto standard for DOS-era multi-user network games. Many games&#x27; longevity were extended through tunneling programs like Kali and Kahn which allowed them to be played over the internet instead of LAN-only. DOSBox emulates IPX over UDP.

===Windows===
Because of IPX/SPX&#x27;s prevalence in LANs in the 1990s, Microsoft added support for the protocols into Windows&#x27; networking stack, starting with Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT. Microsoft even named their implementation &quot;NWLink&quot;, implying that the inclusion of the layer 3/4 transports provided NetWare connectivity. In reality, the protocols were supported as a native transport for Windows&#x27; SMB/NetBIOS, and NetWare connectivity required additional installation of an NCP client (Microsoft provided a basic NetWare client with Windows 95 and later, but it was not automatically installed, and initially only supported NetWare bindery mode). NWLink was still provided with Windows (up to and including Windows Server 2003), but it is neither included with nor supported in Windows Vista. Its use is strongly discouraged because it cannot be used for Windows networking except as a transport for NetBIOS, which is deprecated.

For the most part, Novell&#x27;s 32-bit Windows client software have eschewed NWLink for an alternative developed by Novell, although some versions permit use of Microsoft&#x27;s IPX/SPX implementation (with warnings about potential incompatibility).

===Others===
For several years, Novell supplied a native NetWare client for OS/2. This was similar in structure to the client for DOS.

Novell also published an IPX client for Classic Mac OS called MacIPX. This was not only used by the Mac NetWare client, but also by games such as Doom and Warcraft III for multiplayer play.

Implementations have been written for various flavors of Unix/Linux, both by Novell and other vendors. In particular, Novell&#x27;s UnixWare supported IPX/SPX natively. However, while UnixWare could act as a client to NetWare servers, and applications could optionally support IPX/SPX as a transport, UnixWare did not provide the ability to share files or printers on a NetWare network without an additional software package. Open Enterprise Server - Linux does not support IPX/SPX. The Linux kernel used to support IPX/SPX, but SPX support was removed in 2002, and IPX support was removed in 2018.

The open source FreeBSD operating system includes an IPX/SPX stack, to support both a NetWare file system client, nwfs, as well as NetWare server using Mars NWE (providing some functionality). OpenBSD dropped support with version 4.2, and 4.1 needed some work to compile with IPX.

==Legacy==
IPX usage has declined in recent years, as the rise of the Internet has made TCP/IP ubiquitous. Novell&#x27;s initial attempt to support TCP/IP as a client protocol, called NetWare/IP, simply &quot;tunneled&quot; IPX within IP packets, allowing NetWare clients and servers to communicate over pure TCP/IP networks. However, due to complex implementation and a significant loss in performance due to the tunnelling overhead, NetWare/IP was largely ignored, except as a mechanism to route IPX through TCP/IP-only routers and WAN links. NetWare 5.x introduced native support for NCP over TCP/IP, which is now the preferred configuration. The successor to NetWare, Open Enterprise Server, comes in two flavors: OES-NetWare, which provides legacy support for IPX/SPX (deprecated), and OES-Linux, which only supports TCP/IP.

Both Microsoft and Novell have provided support (through Proxy Server/ISA Server and BorderManager respectively) for IPX/SPX as an intranet protocol to communicate through a firewall. This allows a machine using client software to access the Internet without having TCP/IP installed locally; the client software emulates a native TCP/IP stack and provides WinSock support for local applications (e.g. web browsers), but actually communicates with the firewall over IPX/SPX. In addition to simplifying migration for legacy IPX LANs, this provides a measure of security, as the use of the IPX protocol on the internal network provides a natural barrier against intruders, should the firewall be compromised.

One area where IPX remains useful is for bypassing VPN connections with security policies that prohibit communication with other LAN devices (such as printers and network-attached storage) via TCP/IP.

<doc id="421047" wikidata="Q1133595" url="?curid=421047" title="Meridiani Planum">
<text>Meridiani Planum (alternatively Terra Meridiani) is a large plain straddling the equator of Mars. The plain sits on top of an enormous body of sediments that contains bound water. The iron oxide in the spherules is crystalline (grey) hematite (Fe2O3).

The Meridiani Planum is one of the most thoroughly investigated regions of Mars. Many studies were carried out by the scientists involved with NASA&#x27;s Mars Exploration Rover (MER) &quot;Opportunity&quot;. Two outstanding features found by these investigations are the actions of water flow and aqueous chemistry in this plain&#x27;s geological history and, particularly specific to the plain, an abundance and ubiquity of small spherules composed mainly of grey-hematite that sit loosely on top of the plain&#x27;s soils and underneath embedded inside its sediments. The loose surface spherules were eroded out of the sediments. They are informally called &quot;blueberries&quot;. The plain&#x27;s sediments have extremely high sulfur content (as sulfates) and high phosphate levels.

The boundaries of the Meridiani Planum are not firmly fixed and accepted by the community of Mars planetary scientists. However, the boundaries of the hematite-bearing plain were operationally defined in the late 1990s and early 2000s by the extent of the orbital detection of the plain&#x27;s surface hematite by the thermal emission spectrometer (TES) on the satellite &quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot;. The various names for this region (i.e., Terra Meridiani, Meridiani Planum) started to be used in the published literature in 2002/2003/2004. Each name reflects the coincidental (somewhat arbitrary) fact that the plain straddles the prime meridian for the system of longitude lines introduced for east/west Mars mapping.

The area covered by the detected surface hematite is around 150,000 km2, i.e., larger than Lake Superior () in North America. Except for transport by large meteor impact, loose surface spherules tend to remain within a few meters of their starting embedded location. The surface hematite spherules and sediments are coextensive in surface area. So, the area extent of the underlying sediments is at least as large as the area of detected surface hematite spherules but likely somewhat larger since, for example, a significant area of surface hematite was covered by ejecta from the Bopolu Crater impact. The typical depth of the underlying sediments is several hundred meters.
The Meridiani plain&#x27;s sediments overlay older geological formations that appear around the sediments&#x27; boundary. The plain&#x27;s sediments and surface hematite spherules were formed in three geological epochs and by three different sets of geological processes (more below).

The MER &quot;Opportunity&quot; rover investigated the rim of Endeavour Crater from August 2011 until the rover&#x27;s demise in 2018. The plain&#x27;s sediments do not cover this crater rim and are geologically younger than this rim. As such, the rim of Endeavour Crater is distinct from the plain, although it is surrounded by the plain and its sediments.

==19th Century Maps==
The Meridiani Planum was first observed as part of a larger region that appeared as a distinct dark (low albedo) spot in small telescope images of Mars. Around 1830 the earliest Mars map-makers, Johann Heinrich von Mädler and Wilhelm Beer, 
chose to place the prime meridian for maps of Mars through this dark spot. In the late 1870s, Camille Flammarion called this dark region Sinus Meridiani (&quot;Meridian Bay&quot;). The Meridiani Planum covers the western part of the Sinus Meridiani.

==Viking 1 &amp; Viking 2: Smooth Terrain, Sediments, Water==
The &quot;Viking 1&quot; and &quot;Viking 2&quot; missions successfully landed the first landers on Mars at locations far away from the Meridiani Planum. However, both missions also included satellites (operating between 1976 and 1982) that took many images of the surface of Mars from orbit. Viking 1 and Viking 2 satellite images of what is today called the Meridiani Planum (and its adjacent regions) were studied in three works in the 1980s
and again in two 1997 papers
 published in the months between the launch of the &quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot; mission and its arrival at Mars. Edgett and Parker noted the smooth terrain of what we now call the Meridiani Planum and realized early that the plain was likely made of sediments and probably had a wet, watery past.

== Strategy Impacting the Exploration of Meridiani Planum: Search for Water &amp; Life ==
In the 1990s, NASA officials, especially Daniel S. Goldin, wanted to delineate a framework for &quot;faster, better, cheaper&quot; exploration of Mars. In this context, the &quot;Water Strategy&quot; was outlined in 1995/1996. The &quot;Water Strategy&quot; was &quot;to explore and study Mars in three areas: - Evidence of past or present life, - Climate (weather, processes, and history), - Resources (environment and utilization).&quot; All three areas were seen as intimately connected to water.
High priority goals for NASA in the mid-1990s were to gather some evidence for surface water using satellite surveys and to land robotic rovers on the surface to collect detailed local evidence of water and signs of life.
==Global Satellite Surveys: Surface Hematite &amp; Water==
Two NASA missions arrived at Mars in mid-1997: &quot;Mars Pathfinder&quot; and &quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot;. &quot;Mars Pathfinder&quot; made the first successful Mars landing in over twenty years and the first-ever deployment of a Mars rover, the small, short-lived &quot;Sojourner&quot;. &quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot; surveyed most of the surface of Mars to map its surface topography, some mineral distributions, and make some other measurements.

=== Hematite, Water, Plain, Life Potential: A Place to Land a Rover ===

An important survey carried out between 1997 and 2002 by the &quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot; collected surface hematite levels with the satellite&#x27;s thermal emissions spectrometer (TES). The TES hematite survey data was turned into the low-resolution map shown in Figure 1a. This map, covering all of Mars, has just one large spot covering a region with high hematite levels. This green, yellow, and red spot straddles the equator and the prime meridian in the middle of Figure 1a. A higher resolution image of the high-hematite region is shown in Figure 1b.
In early the 2000s, the hematite map of Figure 1b and the confirmation (from the topography mapping done by the &quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot;) that this area is a flat plain and relatively easy to land on were the decisive pieces of evidence for choosing the Meridiani Planum as one of the landing sites for NASA&#x27;s two bigger 
Mars Exploration Rovers (MERs), named &quot;Opportunity&quot; and &quot;Spirit&quot;.
The decisiveness for NASA of the hematite map of Figure 1b for choosing the landing site for &quot;Opportunity&quot;
was due to the fact that NASA was using high hematite levels as proxy evidence for large amounts of liquid water flowing in the region in the past (hematite only forms in the presence of liquid water in geological settings). In 2003, this high-hematite region was a high-priority place to start to search for signs of life on Mars.

=== Present Day Water at Meridiani Planum (satellite evidence) ===

Since 2001, evidence for water at the present-day Meridiani Planum was collected by the High Energy Neutron Detector (HEND) mounted on the &quot;Mars Odyssey&quot; orbiter. This neutron detector collects signals of &quot;water-equivalent hydrogen&quot; (WEH) over the entire planet. It gradually built up global maps of surface WEH. These maps show that polar and near-polar regions of Mars have the highest levels of surface WEH; although, the Meridiani Planum has relatively high WEH for a non-polar region. The WEH maps are likely to underestimate the present-day water resources at Meridiani Planum since (a) the HEND has a shallow (1 m) penetration depth, (b) the majority of the plain&#x27;s surface is covered in dehydrated soils, and hematite spherules.

==Starting Missions: &quot;Opportunity&quot; rover and other landers==

Starting with Daniel S. Goldin&#x27;s strategies and NASA&#x27;s engineering attention to detail, Mars Exploration Rover &quot;Opportunity&quot; successfully made the &quot;hole-in-one&quot; landing into Eagle Crater at Meridiani Planum on January 24 (PST), 2004. NASA named this landing site the Challenger Memorial Station to honor the final crew of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;, who died in 1986 when that shuttle broke up in flight.

The Meridiani Planum was also the target landing site for two other missions: &quot;Mars Surveyor 2001&quot; Lander and &quot;Schiaparelli&quot; EDM. However, these other two lander missions were not successful. The &quot;Mars Surveyor 2001&quot; Lander was canceled after the failures of the &quot;Mars Climate Orbiter&quot; and &quot;Mars Polar Lander&quot; missions, while the &quot;Schiaparelli&quot; EDM (Entry, Descent, and Landing Demonstrator Module) system lost control during the descent stage and terminally crash-landed on October 19, 2016. (&quot;Schiaparelli&quot; EDM was part of the ExoMars program of the European Space Agency.)

==&quot;Opportunity&quot;&#x27;s Traverse==

&quot;Opportunity&quot; traveled 28.06 miles (45.16 kilometers) across the Meridiani Planum and around the rim of Endeavour Crater between January 2004 and June 2018. Figure 2 highlights the rover&#x27;s traverse route (yellow line). The route&#x27;s position within the Meridiani Planum is shown by the blue line traverse route labeled &quot;OT&quot; in Figure 1b. The journey started on January 25, 2004, with the landing in Eagle Crater. The rover crossed the plain&#x27;s sediments and soils and studied many small and medium-sized craters until August 2011, when it reached the rim of the enormous Endeavour Crater. Between August 2011 and June 10, 2018, it studied the rim of Endeavour (which has different geological features from the plain). The rover&#x27;s last communication with NASA was on June 10, 2018. The &quot;Opportunity&quot; mission was declared ended on February 13, 2019.

==&quot;Opportunity&quot;&#x27;s human-like (Pancam) view of Meridiani Planum==

The &quot;Opportunity&quot; rover had five cameras. One, the Pancam (panoramic cam), was mounted at the height of 1.5 m, i.e., a height similar to the eye height of most people. The Pancam was used to take scientific data, and it also took images that were approximate true color (ATC) photographs of the rover&#x27;s surroundings; that is, the Pancam photographed images close to what people would see if standing in the rover&#x27;s place. The following pictures, Figure 3 through Figure 10, provide a selection of images that cover the common and outstanding features a person would see standing at locations along &quot;Opportunity&quot;&#x27;s traverse of the Meridiani Planum.

===The Wide View: A Flat Plain with Smooth or Ripple Soils===
===Inside Craters: Layered Sediments, Burns Cliff===
===Iron on the ground: Spherules (Blueberries), Meteorites===
===Crater Rim Overview (large and small)===
The dominant visual impressions at eye level are that:
* Meridiani is a very flat plain.
* The plain is primarily covered in dark soils but with patches of lighter sediment outcrop.
* Vast numbers of small bluish-grey hematite spherules (mostly 1 mm - 6 mm in diameter) sit loosely on the soils and sediment outcrop (many more spherules are on soils than outcrop).
* At most locations, you are close to a visible small crater (5 to 30-meter diameters) - the visible small crater density is 65 to 127 craters per km2 (about 1 per hectare or about 1 per 2.5 acres). (There are plenty of tiny craters with diameters below 5 m.)
* At larger craters (like Endurance and Victoria Craters), the crater walls expose large (stratigraphic) sections of Meridiani sediments in which many sediment layers and partly embedded hematite spherules are visible.
* Scattered across the plain are (usually smallish) ejecta blocks of sediment from crater-forming meteorite impacts.
* The tall rims of enormous craters (like Endeavour and Bopolu Craters) are visible from great distances.
* Large meteorites sitting on soils and top sediment outcrops are somewhat rare but outstanding features.
* The soils come in fields with two main bedform types (i) &quot;smooth sheets&quot; (these are remarkably flat, and almost no sediment outcrop is visible in smooth sheet fields) and (ii) &quot;plains ripples&quot; (these are slopped and usually 10 to 40 cm tall and 1.5 to 5 m wide) that are often interspersed with top sediment outcrop.
* There are many sinuous, 1 cm tall &quot;crest&quot; ripples running on top of smooth sheet fields. These crest ripples are made up of sub-millimeter fragments of hematite spherules.

==Composition of the Major Materials found at Meridiani Planum==

This section covers the composition of the major materials found at the Meridiani plain (i.e., sediments, spherules, soils, and dust). The discoveries and compositions of meteorites and long-distance ejecta are given in the next section. 
A later section covers the geological materials found by &quot;Opportunity&quot; after August 2011, i.e., around the rim of Endeavour Crater.

===Sediments===

The layered sedimentary outcrop rocks exposed in Eagle, Fram, and Endurance caters were examined by the suite of instruments on &quot;Opportunity&quot;. Mature data analysis found the following (broad category) mineral composition of the sediments (excluding embedded spherules): 36-37 wt% hydrated sulfates, 35 wt% hydrated aluminosilicates, 16 wt% basaltic rock, 10 wt% hematite and other oxides, 2 wt% chlorides, and 1-2 wt% phosphates. An outstanding feature of this composition is the extreme levels of the sulfates. These are about 5 times higher than the overlying Meridiani soils, about 20 times higher than in the basalts in Gusev Crater (investigated Spirit, the sibling MER), and even more extreme relative to typical Earth rocks. The principle sulfates are hydrated magnesium sulfates (e.g., kieserite &amp; epsomite), hydrated calcium sulfates (e.g., bassanite &amp; gypsum), and jarosite (a complicated hydrated sulfate containing iron and probably potassium or sodium); the chloride salts include halite and bischofite. Detecting jarosite was a surprise, and its presence significantly constrains the possible geochemical pathways leading to the formation of Meridiani sediments.

Water Content? 
An outstanding unknown is the amount of residual water in the layered sediments today. Answers from direct measurement by the rover &quot;Opportunity&quot; were not possible because the rover&#x27;s instruments could not detect water or hydrogen. However, in 2005, Clark et al. gave a range of 6 wt% to 22 wt% based on an indirect geochemical argument. Further, the actual water content should be higher than the water equivalent hydrogen (WEH) measurements made by the neutron detector orbiting on &quot;Mars Odyssey&quot; (due to the shallow (1m) penetration depth of the neutron detector and the layer of water-poor top soil covering most areas of Meridiani). In 2005 the measured WEH level at Meridiani was 7 wt%, but continued neutron detection produced a 2018 WEH map indicating 9-10 wt% WEH across Meridiani.

There is a small field of scientific study concentrating on how hydration levels of hydrated magnesium and calcium sulfates vary with temperature at Martain atmosphere pressures. At Martian pressures, these studies readily extracted water from magnesium sulfates with various levels of hydration using applied temperatures between 50 oC and 200 oC. They also observed a hyper-hydrated magnesium sulfate on Earth that they called meridianiite (after Meridiani Planum), with the formula MgSO4.11H2O, which decomposes to epsomite, MgSO4.7H2O, and water at 2 oC.

&quot;Opportunity&quot;&#x27;s Alpha particle X-ray spectrometer (APXS) found rather high levels of phosphorus in the rocks. Since the solubility of phosphorus is related to the solubility of uranium, thorium, and rare-earth elements, it was suggested these other metals are also enriched in Meridiani outcrop sediments.

===Spherules===

====Early Spherule Results====
Early on, &quot;Opportunity&quot;&#x27;s Mössbauer spectrometer took data that determined that the iron mineral component of these spherules is dominated by hematite. However, the Mössbauer spectrometer provided no information about the mineral components of these spherules that do not contain iron.
The &quot;berry bowl&quot; experiment took alpha particle X-ray spectrometer (APXS) readings of two sampling targets just centimeters apart: One had no (zero or one) spherules in the spectrometer&#x27;s field of view (FOV), while the other had around 25 spherules in the FOV. Figure 11 shows the adjacent &quot;berry bowl&quot; sampling targets. The APXS results indicated there was noticeably more iron in the target with ~25 spherules relative to the target with 0 or 1 spherules. Based on this and similar experiments, several unreviewed conference abstracts claimed (deliberately not cited here) 
that hematite dominated the composition of the spherules and some published papers cited these conference claims. However, there were reasons to be cautious. The instruments detected mixed signals from sampling targets that included signals not only from the spherules but also from dust and rock (in the &quot;berry bowl&quot; experiment) or dust and soils (in other composition data collections). In 2006, Morris et al. showed that the methods used by some researchers to pick out the spherule composition signal from the dust and soil signals were flawed and that such methods could do no more than constrain the iron oxide content of the spherules to between 24 wt% and 100 wt% (that is, almost no constraint at all).

====Later Spherule Results====
A 2008 paper published the result of a clever experiment that showed &quot;Opportunity&quot;&#x27;s mini-TES (thermal emission spectrometer) could not detect any silicate minerals in the spherules. This non-detection constrained silicate levels in spherules to less than 10 wt% and probably below 8 wt%. This result is helpful since the APXS data shows a strong anti-correlation between silicates and iron oxide in the spherules -
so low silicate levels indicate high iron oxide levels.

A recent paper used the mini-TES&#x27;s non-detection of silicates and some improved data analysis methods to find over 340,000 allowable standard oxide chemical compositions for the spherules (allowable = consistent with the silicate non-detection). The lowest and highest weight percentages for the iron oxide content in these allowable spherule compositions were, respectively, 79.5 wt% and 99.8 wt%. While, for the large majority of the allowable compositions, the iron oxide contents in the spherules were between 85 wt% and 96 wt%; further, the nickel content was always close to 0.3 wt%, a group of five standard oxides (MgO, Na2O, P2O5, SO3, and Cl) each had content above trace-level with a combined group content of 6.8 +/- 2.4 wt%, the SiO2 levels ranged between 8 wt% and 0 wt%, and the other eight APXS standard oxides had either 0 wt% content or only trace level content.

===Soils===

The underlying soils at Meridiani Planum are similar to those at Gusev Crater, Ares Vallis, and Gale Crater; although, the levels of sulfates in Meridiani soils are noticeably higher than other locations. At Meridiani Planum, the soils are armored with a thin top layer of hematite spherules with their distinct composition (not found at Gusev Crater, Ares Vallis, and Gale Crater). This layering of spherules (and spherule fragments) on top, with basaltic soils below, is shown in Figure 12.

Most of the underlying soil consists of basaltic material but mixed with varying amounts of dust and sulfate-rich ejecta debris from the sediments. A typical mineral composition for basaltic Meridiani soils is 40 wt% plagioclase, 35 wt% pyroxenes, 15 wt% amorphous glasses, 10 wt% olivine, and around 5 wt% sulfates and oxides. Standard oxide compositions for typical basaltic soils are 44-46 wt% SiO2, 18-19 wt% FeO + Fe2O3, 9-10 wt% Al2O3, 7.4 wt% MgO, 6.9 wt% CaO2, 5.8 wt% SO3, 2.2 wt% Na2O, ~5 wt% other oxides (total).

===Dust===

Dust covers everything all over Mars and the composition of this dust is essentially uniform everywhere, due to the many dust storms over Mars, including global dust storms every few years.

&quot;Opportunity&quot;&#x27;s APXS measurement of a commonly referenced dust-covered sampling target, MontBlanc_LeHauches, gives a dust composition that is largely basaltic in character with the following weight perecentages for the standard oxides: 45.3 wt% SiO2, 17.6 wt% Fe0, 9.2 wt% Al2O3, 7.6 wt% MgO, 7.3 wt% SO3, 6.6 wt% CaO, 2.2 wt% Na20, 1.0 TiO2, 0.9 wt% P2O5, and a total of 2.0 wt% for the other seven standard oxides.

A Mössbauer spectrum was made of the dust that gathered on &quot;Opportunity&quot;″s capture magnet. The results suggested that the magnetic component of the dust was titanomagnetite, rather than just plain magnetite, as was once thought. A small amount of olivine was detected which was interpreted as indicating a long arid period on the planet. On the other hand, a small amount of hematite that was present meant that there may have been liquid water for a short time in the early history of the planet.

==Discoveries of Meteorites &amp; Long Distance Ejecta==

===Meteorites===
&quot;Opportunity&quot; found six large iron-nickel meteorites just sitting on the plains (Heat Shield Rock (shown in Figure 8), Block Island, Shelter Island, Mackinac Island, Oileán Ruaidh, and Ireland), 
although these six may originate from fewer impacts (i.e., an original meteor broke into pieces). 
Examination with the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES), Mossbauer spectrometer, and APXS led researchers to classify Heat Shield Rock as an IAB meteorite with close to 93 wt% iron content and 7 wt% nickel content (mostly in metallic form). Heat Shield Rock (see Figure 8) was the first meteorite recognized on another planet. 
(The other MER, Spirit, found two rocks in Gusev Crater, &quot;Allan Hills&quot; and &quot;Zhong Shan,&quot; that may be iron meteorites.)

The top layers of the plain&#x27;s soils contain a noticeable content (~1 wt%) of small-particle, iron-nickel meteoritic material 
 - many iron-nickel meteorites disintegrate during descent and impact, and these pieces were too small for the Pancam to identify.

Stony meteorites are more challenging to identify than iron-nickel meteorites. However, the cobble named &quot;Fig Tree Barberton&quot; and three others in the &quot;Barberton group&quot; are thought to be stony or stony-iron meteorites (mesosiderite silicate).

&quot;Opportunity&quot; studied nine cobbles in the &quot;Arkansas Group&quot; that were breccias displaying evidence of material melting from heat generated by meteorite impacts.

===Long Distance Ejecta===
The rover found two odd boulders with mineralogies significantly different from the plain&#x27;s common sediment rocks.
One rock, &quot;Bounce Rock,&quot; contains mainly pyroxene and plagioclase but no olivine. It closely resembled a part, Lithology B, of the shergottite meteorite EETA 79001, a meteorite on Earth known to have come from Mars. Bounce rock received its name by being bounced on by the airbags of &quot;Opportunity&quot;&#x27;s lander. The other rock, &quot;Marquette Island,&quot; is believed to have originated deep inside the crust of Mars. Both &quot;Bounce Rock&quot; and &quot;Marquette Island&quot; are considered to be ejecta from large crater impacts occurring off the plain at large distances from where these rocks were found by the rover.

==Geological history==

The history of geological change at Meridiani Planum fits into three epochs with distinct processes. These three eras of change at Meridiani align reasonably well with the three standard epochs for the whole planet, i.e., the Noachian, Hesperian, and Amazonian epochs.

===Noachian River Flows===

Prior to the formation of Meridiani&#x27;s defining sediments, in the wet Noachian (named for the biblical Noah) more than about ~3.7 billion years ago, liquid water was present and plentiful enough to form river channels that bought and deposited large quantities of basaltic silt to the current Meridiani region. Edgett and Parker could barely discern some of these river valleys in the &quot;Viking&quot; orbiter images from the 1970s. However, they are easy to see in thermal inertia images taken in orbit by &quot;Mars Odyssey&quot; and reproduced in Figure 13 (click on it for higher resolution). These river channels took water from the higher ground in the southeast (lower right of Figure 13) toward the northwest and down to the present-day Meridiani Planum. The river valleys seen in Figure 13 terminate abruptly as they flow into the Meridiani&#x27;s massive formation of sediments.

Current evidence points to the sloping ground (necessary for the river flows) being created by a giant tilt in the surface of Terra Meridiani Mars caused by the emergence of the enormous Tharsis Plateau and the vast volcanoes of Tharsis several thousand kilometers away.

===Formation of Today&#x27;s Sediments &amp; Embedded Spherules===

From around the late-Noachian/early-Hesperian to sometime around 3.5 billion years ago, the layered sediments deposited in the earlier Noachian epoch were transformed. This transformation probably included a significant additional deposition of high-sulfur-content material of volcanic origin. The change certainly included aqueous geochemistry that was acidic and salty, as well as rising &amp; falling water levels: Features providing evidence include cross-bedded sediments, the presence of vugs (cavities), and embedded hematite spherules that cut across sediment layers, additionally the presence of large amounts of magnesium sulfate and other sulfate-rich minerals such as jarosite and chlorides. Jarosite formation requires aqueous acidic conditions below pH 3.

Figures 14 and 15 show Microscopic Imager close-up images of the sediment rock matrix that appeared (cropped) in a prestigious paper. Figure 14 illustrates the four physical constituents of sediment outcrop: (i) the sedimentary layers containing a lot of basaltic sand particles; (ii) the embedded hematite spherules; (iii) fine-grained, sulfate-rich cement (in most parts of the outcrop); (iv) vug cavities (that are thought to be molds for crystals of, for example, hydrated sulfates). Figure 15 images a similar sediment outcrop surface to Figure 14. However, &quot;Opportunity&quot;&#x27;s Rock Abrasion Tool abraded this surface. Such abrasions showed that (a) the sediment layers are very soft and easy to cut, and (b) the hematite spherules have uniform internal structures.
The &quot;diagenetic&quot; transformation (i.e., change by water-rock interactions) to today&#x27;s sediments involved a significant shift in water flows in the region. The inflows from rivers became less and less, and in this period, the dominant water movements in the sediments became vertical movements with rising and falling aquifer levels. 
At least one model of global Martian hydrology accounts for the historical shift in water flows at Meridiani Planum. This model links Meridiani&#x27;s change in water flows to activity in the volcanic Tharsis region. With the vertical aquifer flows, it is believed that (playa) lakes repeatedly formed and disappeared as the aquifer levels rose and fell. (The dry area around Utah&#x27;s Great Salt Lake is a playa.) The &quot;Opportunity&quot; team found minerals (&quot;evaporites&quot;) that typically form when salty water evaporates; these evaporites cemented together other components of the sediment (such as basaltic particles and the spherules).

McLennan and his students constructed a geochemical model that generates hematite within a context like the Meridiani sediment. The hematite formed into spherules by concretion. The concretion process to form near spherical balls (spherules) of hematite probably occurred by diffusion of the hematite through the sedimentary rock matrix (the hematite still in the rock matrix probably fixed in place when moveable water disappeared).

The results of these transformations are still largely intact today. The main subsequent changes just affected the top layers of the Meridiani sediments (more below).

===Crater Degradation, Formation of Soils &amp; Loose Spherules===

The period of rising and falling aquifer levels ceased, and no water flowed on Meridiani Planum thereafter. Although, when this happened is poorly understood. Estimates include around 3.5 billion years ago and about 3 billion years ago. The only water left at the plain was and is bound in rocks.

Erosion with water flows in earlier eras was much faster than in this last (and present) arid epoch.
However, erosion did not stop. Other much slower erosional processes continued and became the primary agents of change to the plain. This slower change was and is driven by meteorite impacts, the wind, and gravity. Over the hard-to-grasp eon of around three billion years, meteorite impacts, and the wind formed the sandy topsoil and loose hematite spherules and sorted these into the layered soil bedforms that &quot;Opportunity&quot;&#x27;s Pancam photographed, and we can now see.

The meteorite, gravity, and wind-driven processes work like this:
* Over billions of years, meteorite impacts created many craters on the plain.
* There were enough small (5 to 30 m diameter) craters created in the eon of around three billion years to cover, on average, the whole plain once. Although, each small crater degraded and disappeared in about 25 million years or less, and only about 0.7% of the plain&#x27;s area is presently covered in small craters.
* Each meteorite impact produces large numbers of blocks of sediment material in the crater rim and as ejecta around the crater: See, for example, Concepcion Crater in Figure 10 and the tiny Granada Crater (on the right side) of Figure 9.
* Most of the initial sediment blocks project above the surrounding material (by a few centimeters or more) and are exposed to saltating sand (i.e., wind-driven, bouncing sand).
* The saltating sand erodes the soft, easy-to-erode parts of the sediment matrix in the projecting blocks.
* These blocks are either completely eroded or erode until they become smooth and no longer project into saltating sand.
* This block erosion creates dust particles and turns embedded spherules into loose spherules (more below).
* The dust particles are blown off the plain and become part of the global dust.
* The sulfates preferentially turn into dust and are transported off the plain by the wind.
* The larger basalt sand particles, spherules fragments, and hematite spherules remain in place on the plain.
* Wind, gravity, and size-sorting created the soil bedforms from the basaltic sands, spherule fragments, and spherules.
* With the aid of gravity and wind, the original (small) crater holes are gradually filled in (with material from eroded rim blocks and other local erosion material), and the plain is returned to a flat state.

Phil Christensen outlined these processes in 2004, soon after &quot;Opportunity&quot; landed. Later, more in-depth research (with more years of data from &quot;Opportunity&quot;) confirmed the above processes and added details. Christensen&#x27;s rapid assessment of the erosional processes was probably connected to his correct 2000 prediction that the plain&#x27;s surface material is soft and easy-to-erode (friable). And that prediction was made after orbiter data showed that Meridiani Planum is very smooth and that small craters degrade and disappear more rapidly than in adjoining regions.

&quot;Opportunity&quot; found that Meridiani sediments are soft and friable. More satellite and rover data showed that erosion rates on the Meridiani Planum are both very slow (relative to water-related erosion on Earth and early Mars) but also extremely fast (about 30 to 300 times faster) when compared to other arid regions of Mars (such as Gusev Crater).

Figure 17 shows hematite spherules as they turned from being embedded spherules into loose spherules. In Figure 17, right around seven blocks of eroding sediment ejecta (from the tiny Granada Crater) are rings surrounding these blocks where these rings are formed by locally high surface concentrations of loose spherules and caused by additional loose spherules eroding out of the blocks of sediment. Figure 17 is cropped from Figure 7, which was, in turn, cropped from Figure 9. Click and enlarge Figure 17 to see the high-density rings of spherules.

==Size &amp; Surface Density of Hematite Spherules (Blueberries)==

===Spherule Size===

The size of the hematite spherules varied by location along &quot;Opportunity&quot;&#x27;s traverse of Meridiani Planum. The figures below illustrate this variation. Figures 18, 19, and 20 show loose surface spherules at Eagle Crater (the rover&#x27;s landing site in January 2004), 500m northwest of Victoria Carter (August 2007), and 200m outside the rim of Endeavour crater (late July 2011). The straight-line distance between the sampling targets shown in Figures 18 and 20 is about 23 km (the rover&#x27;s route between the two targets was 33 km). Figure 20 features one of the largest spherules photographed on the plain by &quot;Opportunity&quot;&#x27;s Microscopic Imager; it is 8.3 mm in diameter.

Figure 21 shows spherule fragments (or very small spherules) in a &quot;crest ripple&quot;. These were right next to much larger spherules lying on top of smooth sandy soils and within a few meters of the trench shown in Figure 12. The top section of Figure 12 shows two crest ripples and the much larger spherules spread out between the crest ripples on top of the soils. The wide view Figure 3 also shows crest ripples as the sinuous wind-formed lines on top of the smooth sandy soil bedforms.

===Numbers of Hematite Spherules &amp; Loose Spherule Surface Density===

There are no peer-reviewed published estimates of the number of loose hematite spherules on Meridiani&#x27;s soils or embedded hematite spherules in the plain&#x27;s sediments. However, the reader can sense how mind-boggling big those numbers are with a photograph of an area of soil with a typical surface density of the hematite spheres. Such a photograph &quot;has&quot; been published.

Figures 22 and 23 are true-color and false-color versions of the photo. The spherules are easier to see in the published false-color version (Figure 23). Click on it to enlarge it. The sampling target of Figures 22 &amp; 23 had 29% coarse hematite coverage. The range of coverage among similar targets was 10% to 40%. These targets were sampled over a wide area, between Sol 70 (2004-04-04) and Sol 999 (2007-11-15).

The parts of the plain &quot;Opportunity&quot; studied are &quot;not&quot; special: Compared to the rest of Meridiani Planum, they do not have high surface hematite levels. To see this, look at the plain&#x27;s surface hematite map (Figure 1b) and the small blue line (labeled OT) indicating the route of &quot;Opportunity&quot;&#x27;s Traverse of the plain.

The mind-bogglingness of the number of loose hematite spherules hits when Figures 22 &amp; 23 are extrapolated to the plain&#x27;s whole surface area (about 150,000 km2): 150,000 km2 is close to 2/3&#x27;s the area of the main island of Japan (Honshu) and also 72% the area of the main island of the UK (Great Britain), it is also bigger than the land areas of 30 of the 50 states of the USA.

The number of embedded spherules (in the plain&#x27;s sediments) is probably much higher than the number of loose spherules (on soils). Since (1) the estimates of the erosion depth of original sediment needed to produce the loose spherules are less than 1 meter, while (2) the typical depths of the plain&#x27;s sediments are several hundred meters.

==Summary of Evidence of Water==

Many lines of evidence indicate water either at Meridiani Planum today or in the distant past. 
Before giving a short summary of the major lines of evidence already provided above, a few more are introduced.
Some rocks showed small layers (laminations) with shapes only made by gently flowing water. The first such laminations were found in a rock called &quot;The Dells.&quot; Geologists would say that the cross-stratification showed festoon geometry from transport in subaqueous ripples. Figure 24 illustrates cross-stratification, also called crossbedding.

The concentration of the element bromine in rocks was highly variable. This may be evidence of water. Bromine is very soluble and may have moved with water flows. Thin-film water frost deposition may have concentrated bromine in certain spots.

In mid-2004, thermal inertia signals (collected by the &quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot;&#x27;s TES) for &quot;light-toned outcrop&quot; (that is, outcrops of the plain&#x27;s sediments) were found all over Meridiani Planum and also over extensive adjacent regions to the west, north, and east of the plain. Noting early results from &quot;Opportunity&quot; that the outcrop showed evidence of &quot;long-term water interaction locally at the landing site&quot;, ref suggested the entire region with light-toned outcrop displayed evidence of past water.

&quot;Major Lines of Evidence for Water:&quot;

The orbiting satellite evidence includes (A) the TES spectra for surface hematite (mapped in Figure 1b) since hematite only forms in watery conditions, and (B) the orbiting neutron detector&#x27;s finding of fairly high levels of WEH over the plain and the adjacent regions (to the west, north, and east).

The deposition of sediments and the visible dried-up river valleys flowing into the plain&#x27;s sediments are both strong evidence of ancient water flows in the Meridiani region.

The stratigraphic details of plain&#x27;s sediments provide several lines of evidence for water, including cross-bedded sediments, the presence of vugs (cavities), and embedded hematite spherules that cut across sediment layers. The geochemical details of plain&#x27;s sediments provide more lines of evidence for water, including the presence of large amounts of magnesium sulfate and other sulfate-rich minerals such as jarosite as well as chlorides.

== Endeavour Crater ==

At Endeavour Crater, Opportunity investigated the Homestake Vein, the Matijevic formation containing smectites, the Shoemaker formation composed of breccia at the crater rim, the Grasberg formation composed of clastics, and much else.
&quot;Homestake Vein:&quot;
In December 2011, &quot;Opportunity&quot; had driven onto the rim of Endeavour Crater and found a white vein identified as being pure gypsum.
Tests confirmed that it contained calcium, sulfur, and water. It was formed when water carrying gypsum in solution deposited the mineral in a crack in the rock. The vein is called &quot;Homestake.&quot; It is in a zone where the sulfate-rich sedimentary bedrock of the plains meets older, volcanic bedrock exposed at the rim of Endeavour.

==North of Meridiani Planum==
A broad region north of the Meridiani plain displays layered features from orbit. 

A detailed discussion of layering with many Martian examples can be found in Sedimentary Geology of Mars.

<text>Spirit, also known as MER-A (Mars Exploration Rover – A) or MER-2, is a Mars robotic rover, active from 2004 to 2010. &quot;Spirit&quot; was operational on Mars for sols or 3.3 Martian years ( days; ). It was one of two rovers of NASA&#x27;s Mars Exploration Rover Mission managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Spirit landed successfully within the impact crater Gusev on Mars at 04:35 Ground UTC on January 4, 2004, three weeks before its twin, &quot;Opportunity&quot; (MER-B), which landed on the other side of the planet. Its name was chosen through a NASA-sponsored student essay competition. The rover got stuck in a &quot;sand trap&quot; in late 2009 at an angle that hampered recharging of its batteries; its last communication with Earth was on March 22, 2010.

The rover completed its planned 90-sol mission (slightly less than 92.5 Earth days). Aided by cleaning events that resulted in more energy from its solar panels, &quot;Spirit&quot; went on to function effectively over twenty times longer than NASA planners expected. &quot;Spirit&quot; also logged of driving instead of the planned , allowing more extensive geological analysis of Martian rocks and planetary surface features. Initial scientific results from the first phase of the mission (the 90-sol prime mission) were published in a special issue of the journal &quot;Science&quot;.

On May 1, 2009 (5 years, 3 months, 27 Earth days after landing; 21 times the planned mission duration), &quot;Spirit&quot; became stuck in soft sand. This was not the first of the mission&#x27;s &quot;embedding events&quot; and for the following eight months NASA carefully analyzed the situation, running Earth-based theoretical and practical simulations, and finally programming the rover to make extrication drives in an attempt to free itself. These efforts continued until January 26, 2010, when NASA officials announced that the rover was likely irrecoverably obstructed by its location in soft sand, 
though it continued to perform scientific research from its current location.

The rover continued in a stationary science platform role until communication with &quot;Spirit&quot; stopped on March 22, 2010 (sol ). JPL continued to attempt to regain contact until May 24, 2011, when NASA announced that efforts to communicate with the unresponsive rover had ended, calling the mission complete. A formal farewell took place at NASA headquarters shortly thereafter.

==Objectives==
The scientific objectives of the Mars Exploration Rover mission were to:

*Search for and characterize a variety of rocks and soils that hold clues to past water activity. In particular, samples sought include those that have minerals deposited by water-related processes such as precipitation, evaporation, sedimentary cementation, or hydrothermal activity.
*Determine the distribution and composition of minerals, rocks, and soils surrounding the landing sites.
*Determine what geologic processes have shaped the local terrain and influenced the chemistry. Such processes could include water or wind erosion, sedimentation, hydrothermal mechanisms, volcanism, and cratering.
*Perform calibration and validation of surface observations made by Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) instruments. This will help determine the accuracy and effectiveness of various instruments that survey Martian geology from orbit.
*Search for iron-containing minerals, and to identify and quantify relative amounts of specific mineral types that contain water or were formed in water, such as iron-bearing carbonates.
*Characterize the mineralogy and textures of rocks and soils to determine the processes that created them.
*Search for geological clues to the environmental conditions that existed when liquid water was present.
*Assess whether those environments were conducive to life.

== Mission timeline ==


&quot;Opportunity&quot; and &quot;Spirit&quot; rovers were part of the Mars Exploration Rover program in the long-term Mars Exploration Program. The Mars Exploration Program&#x27;s four principal goals were to determine if the potential for life exists on Mars (in particular, whether recoverable water may be found on Mars), to characterize the Mars climate and its geology, and then to prepare for a potential human mission to Mars. The Mars Exploration Rovers were to travel across the Martian surface and perform periodic geologic analyses to determine if water ever existed on Mars as well as the types of minerals available, as well as to corroborate data taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). Both rovers were designed with an expected 90 sols (92 Earth days) lifetime, but each lasted much longer than expected. &quot;Spirit&quot; mission lasted 20 times longer than its expected lifetime, and its mission was declared ended on May 25, 2011, after it got stuck in soft sand and expended its power reserves trying to free itself. &quot;Opportunity&quot; lasted 55 times longer than its 90 sol planned lifetime, operating for days from landing to mission end. An archive of weekly updates on the rover&#x27;s status can be found at the &quot;Opportunity&quot; Update Archive. 

=== Launch and landing ===

The MER-A (&quot;Spirit&quot;) and MER-B (&quot;Opportunity&quot;) were launched on June 10, 2003 and July 7, 2003, respectively. Though both probes launched on Boeing Delta II 7925-9.5 rockets from Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 17 (CCAFS SLC-17), MER-B was on the heavy version of that launch vehicle, needing the extra energy for Trans-Mars injection. The launch vehicles were integrated onto pads right next to each other, with MER-A on CCAFS SLC-17A and MER-B on CCAFS SLC-17B. The dual pads allowed for working the 15- and 21-day planetary launch periods close together; the last possible launch day for MER-A was June 19, 2003 and the first day for MER-B was June 25, 2003. NASA&#x27;s Launch Services Program managed the launch of both spacecraft.

&quot;Spirit&quot; successfully landed on the surface of Mars on 04:35 Spacecraft Event Time (SCET) on January 4, 2004. This was the start of its 90-sol mission, but solar cell cleaning events would mean it was the start of a much longer mission, lasting until 2010. &quot;Spirit&quot; was targeted to a site that appears to have been affected by liquid water in the past, the crater Gusev, a possible former lake in a giant impact crater about from the center of the target ellipse at . After the airbag-protected landing craft settled onto the surface, the rover rolled out to take panoramic images. These give scientists the information they need to select promising geological targets and drive to those locations to perform on-site scientific investigations. The MER team named the landing site &quot;&quot;Columbia&quot; Memorial Station,&quot; in honor of the seven astronauts killed in the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster.

On May 1, 2009 (sol ), the rover became stuck in soft sand, the machine resting upon a cache of iron(III) sulfate (jarosite) hidden under a veneer of normal-looking soil. Iron sulfate has very little cohesion, making it difficult for the rover&#x27;s wheels to gain traction.

On January 26, 2010 (sol ), after several months attempting to free the rover, NASA decided to redefine the mobile robot mission by calling it a stationary research platform. Efforts were directed in preparing a more suitable orientation of the platform in relation to the Sun in an attempt to allow a more efficient recharge of the platform&#x27;s batteries. This was needed to keep some systems operational during the Martian winter. On March 30, 2010, Spirit skipped a planned communication session and as anticipated from recent power-supply projections, had probably entered a low-power hibernation mode.

The last communication with the rover was March 22, 2010 (sol ) and there is a strong possibility the rover&#x27;s batteries lost so much energy at some point that the mission clock stopped. In previous winters the rover was able to park on a Sun-facing slope and keep its internal temperature above , but since the rover was stuck on flat ground it is estimated that its internal temperature dropped to . If &quot;Spirit&quot; had survived these conditions and there had been a cleaning event, there was a possibility that with the southern summer solstice in March 2011, solar energy would increase to a level that would wake up the rover.

&quot;Spirit&quot; remains silent at its location, called &quot;Troy,&quot; on the west side of Home Plate. There was no communication with the rover after March 22, 2010 (sol ).

It is likely that &quot;Spirit&quot; experienced a low-power fault and had turned off all sub-systems, including communication, and gone into a deep sleep, trying to recharge its batteries. It is also possible that the rover had experienced a mission clock fault. If that had happened, the rover would have lost track of time and tried to remain asleep until enough sunlight struck the solar arrays to wake it. This state is called &quot;Solar Groovy.&quot; If the rover woke up from a mission clock fault, it would only listen. Starting on July 26, 2010 (sol ), a new procedure to address the possible mission clock fault was implemented.

=== End of mission ===
JPL continued attempts to regain contact with &quot;Spirit&quot; until May 25, 2011, when NASA announced the end of contact efforts and the completion of the mission. 
According to NASA, the rover likely experienced excessively cold &quot;internal temperatures&quot; due to &quot;inadequate energy to run its survival heaters&quot; that, in turn, was a result of &quot;a stressful Martian winter without much sunlight.&quot; Many critical components and connections would have been &quot;susceptible to damage from the cold.&quot; Assets that had been needed to support &quot;Spirit&quot; were transitioned to support &quot;Spirit&#x27;s&quot; then still-active twin, &quot;Opportunity&quot;.

The primary surface mission for &quot;Spirit&quot; was planned to last at least 90 sols. The mission received several extensions and lasted about 2,208 sols. On August 11, 2007, &quot;Spirit&quot; obtained the second longest operational duration on the surface of Mars for a lander or rover at 1282 Sols, one sol longer than the Viking 2 lander. Viking 2 was powered by a nuclear cell whereas &quot;Spirit&quot; is powered by solar arrays. Until &quot;Opportunity&quot; overtook it on May 19, 2010, the Mars probe with longest operational period was Viking 1 that lasted for 2245 Sols on the surface of Mars. On March 22, 2010, &quot;Spirit&quot; sent its last communication, thus falling just over a month short of surpassing Viking 1&#x27;s operational record. An archive of weekly updates on the rover&#x27;s status can be found at the &quot;Spirit&quot; Update Archive.

==Design and construction==


&quot;Spirit&quot; (and its twin, &quot;Opportunity&quot;) are six-wheeled, solar-powered robots standing high, wide and long and weighing . Six wheels on a rocker-bogie system enabled mobility over rough terrain. Each wheel had its own motor. The vehicle was steered at front and rear and was designed to operate safely at tilts of up to 30 degrees. The maximum speed was ; , although the average speed was about . Both &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot; have pieces of the fallen World Trade Center&#x27;s metal on them that were &quot;turned into shields to protect cables on the drilling mechanisms&quot;.

Solar arrays generated about 140 watts for up to fourteen hours per sol, while rechargeable lithium ion batteries stored energy for use at night. &quot;Spirit&quot;″s onboard computer uses a 20 MHz RAD6000 CPU with 128 MB of DRAM and 3 MB of EEPROM. The rover&#x27;s operating temperature ranges from and radioisotope heaters provide a base level of heating, assisted by electrical heaters when necessary.

Communications depended on an omnidirectional low-gain antenna communicating at a low data rate and a steerable high-gain antenna, both in direct contact with Earth. A low-gain antenna was also used to relay data to spacecraft orbiting Mars.

===Science payload===

The science instruments included:

* Panoramic Camera (Pancam) – examined the texture, color, mineralogy, and structure of the local terrain.
* Navigation Camera (Navcam) – monochrome with a higher field of view but lower resolution, for navigation and driving.
* Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES) – identified promising rocks and soils for closer examination, and determined the processes that formed them.
* Hazcams, two B&amp;W cameras with 120 degree field of view, that provided additional data about the rover&#x27;s surroundings.

The rover arm held the following instruments:

* Mössbauer spectrometer (MB) MIMOS II – used for close-up investigations of the mineralogy of iron-bearing rocks and soils.
* Alpha particle X-ray spectrometer (APXS) – close-up analysis of the abundances of elements that make up rocks and soils.
* Magnets – for collecting magnetic dust particles.
* Microscopic Imager (MI) – obtained close-up, high-resolution images of rocks and soils.
* Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT) – exposed fresh material for examination by instruments on board.

&quot;Spirit&quot; was &#x27;driven&#x27; by several operators throughout its mission.

===Power===
The rover uses a combination of solar cells and a rechargeable chemical battery. This class of rover has two rechargeable lithium batteries, each composed of 8 cells with 8 amp-hour capacity. At the start of the mission the solar panels could provide up to around 900 watt-hours (Wh) per day to recharge the battery and power system in one Sol, but this could vary due to a variety of factors. In Eagle crater the cells were producing about 840 Wh per day, but by Sol 319 in December 2004, it had dropped to 730 Wh per day.

Like Earth, Mars has seasonal variations that reduce sunlight during winter. However, since the Martian year is longer than that of the Earth, the seasons fully rotate roughly once every 2 Earth years. By 2016, MER-B had endured seven Martian winters, during which times power levels drop which can mean the rover avoids doing activities that use a lot of power. During its first winter power levels dropped to under 300 Wh per day for two months, but some later winters were not as bad.

Another factor that can reduce received power is dust in the atmosphere, especially dust storms. Dust storms have occurred quite frequently when Mars is closest to the Sun. Global dust storms in 2007 reduced power levels for &quot;Opportunity&quot; and &quot;Spirit&quot; so much they could only run for a few minutes each day. Due to the 2018 dust storms on Mars, &quot;Opportunity&quot; entered hibernation mode on June 12, but it remained silent after the storm subsided in early October.

==Discoveries==
The rocks on the plains of Gusev are a type of basalt. They contain the minerals olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase and magnetite. They look like volcanic basalt, as they are fine-grained with irregular holes (geologists would say they have vesicles and vugs).
Much of the soil on the plains came from the breakdown of the local rocks. Fairly high levels of nickel were found in some soils; probably from meteorites.

Analysis shows that the rocks have been slightly altered by tiny amounts of water. Outside coatings and cracks inside the rocks suggest water deposited minerals, maybe bromine compounds. All the rocks contain a fine coating of dust and one or more harder rinds of material. One type can be brushed off, while another needed to be ground off by the Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT).

The dust in Gusev Crater is the same as dust all around the planet. All the dust was found to be magnetic. Moreover, &quot;Spirit&quot; found the magnetism was caused by the mineral magnetite, especially magnetite that contained the element titanium. One magnet was able to completely divert all dust, hence all Martian dust is thought to be magnetic. The spectra of the dust was similar to spectra of bright, low thermal inertia regions like Tharsis and Arabia that have been detected by orbiting satellites. A thin layer of dust, maybe less than one millimeter thick, covers all surfaces. Something in it contains a small amount of chemically bound water.

==Astronomy==
&quot;Spirit&quot; pointed its cameras towards the sky and observed a transit of the Sun by Mars&#x27; moon Deimos (see Transit of Deimos from Mars). It also took the first photo of Earth from the surface of another planet in early March 2004.

In late 2005, &quot;Spirit&quot; took advantage of a favorable energy situation to make multiple nighttime observations of both of Mars&#x27; moons Phobos and Deimos. These observations included a &quot;lunar&quot; (or rather phobian) eclipse as &quot;Spirit&quot; watched Phobos disappear into Mars&#x27; shadow. Some of &quot;Spirit&quot;&#x27;s star gazing was designed to look for a predicted meteor shower caused by Halley&#x27;s Comet, and although at least four imaged streaks were suspect meteors, they could not be unambiguously differentiated from those caused by cosmic rays.

A transit of Mercury from Mars took place on January 12, 2005, from about 14:45 UTC to 23:05 UTC. Theoretically, this could have been observed by both &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot;; however, camera resolution did not permit seeing Mercury&#x27;s 6.1&quot; angular diameter. They were able to observe transits of Deimos across the Sun, but at 2&#x27; angular diameter, Deimos is about 20 times larger than Mercury&#x27;s 6.1&quot; angular diameter. Ephemeris data generated by JPL Horizons indicates that &quot;Opportunity&quot; would have been able to observe the transit from the start until local sunset at about 19:23 UTC Earth time, while &quot;Spirit&quot; would have been able to observe it from local sunrise at about 19:38 UTC until the end of the transit.

==Equipment wear and failures==
Both rovers passed their original mission time of 90 sols many times over. The extended time on the surface, and therefore additional stress on components, resulted in some issues developing.

On March 13, 2006 (sol ), the right front wheel ceased working after having covered on Mars. Engineers began driving the rover backwards, dragging the dead wheel. Although this resulted in changes to driving techniques, the dragging effect became a useful tool, partially clearing away soil on the surface as the rover traveled, thus allowing areas to be imaged that would normally be inaccessible. However, in mid-December 2009, to the surprise of the engineers, the right front wheel showed slight movement in a wheel-test on sol 2113 and clearly rotated with normal resistance on three of four wheel-tests on sol 2117, but stalled on the fourth. On November 29, 2009 (sol ), the right rear wheel also stalled and remained inoperable for the remainder of the mission.

Scientific instruments also experienced degradation as a result of exposure to the harsh Martian environment and use over a far longer period than had been anticipated by the mission planners. Over time, the diamond in the resin grinding surface of the Rock Abrasion Tool wore down, after that the device could only be used to brush targets. All of the other science instruments and engineering cameras continued to function until contact was lost; however, towards the end of &quot;Spirit&quot;&#x27;s life, the MIMOS II Mössbauer spectrometer took much longer to produce results than it did earlier in the mission because of the decay of its cobalt-57 gamma ray source that has a half life of 271 days.

== Legacy and honors ==

To commemorate &quot;Spirit&quot;&#x27;s great contribution to the exploration of Mars, the asteroid 37452 Spirit has been named after it. The name was proposed by Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld who along with Cornelis Johannes van Houten and Tom Gehrels discovered the asteroid on September 24, 1960.

To honor the rover, the JPL team named an area near Endeavour Crater explored by the &quot;Opportunity&quot; rover, &#x27;Spirit Point&#x27;.

Documentary film, &quot;Good Night Oppy&quot;, about the &quot;Opportunity&quot;, &quot;Spirit&quot;, and their long missions, was directed by Ryan White, and included support from JPL and Industrial Light &amp; Magic. It was released in 2022.

==Gallery==
The rover could take pictures with its different cameras, but only the PanCam camera had the ability to photograph a scene with different color filters. The panorama views were usually built up from PanCam images. &quot;Spirit&quot; transferred 128,224 pictures in its lifetime.

<text>Opportunity, also known as MER-B (Mars Exploration Rover – B) or MER-1, and nicknamed Oppy, is a robotic rover that was active on Mars from 2004 until 2018. &quot;Opportunity&quot; was operational on Mars for sols ( on Earth). Launched on July 7, 2003, as part of NASA&#x27;s Mars Exploration Rover program, it landed in Meridiani Planum on January 25, 2004, three weeks after its twin, &quot;Spirit&quot; (MER-A), touched down on the other side of the planet. With a planned 90-sol duration of activity (slightly less than 92.5 Earth days), &quot;Spirit&quot; functioned until it got stuck in 2009 and ceased communications in 2010, while &quot;Opportunity&quot; was able to stay operational for sols after landing, maintaining its power and key systems through continual recharging of its batteries using solar power, and hibernating during events such as dust storms to save power. This careful operation allowed &quot;Opportunity&quot; to operate for 57 times its designed lifespan, exceeding the initial plan by (in Earth time). By June 10, 2018, when it last contacted NASA, the rover had traveled a distance of . 
Mission highlights included the initial 90-sol mission, finding meteorites such as Heat Shield Rock (Meridiani Planum meteorite), and over two years of exploring and studying Victoria crater. The rover survived moderate dust storms and in 2011 reached Endeavour crater, which has been considered as a &quot;second landing site&quot;. The &quot;Opportunity&quot; mission is considered one of NASA&#x27;s most successful ventures.

Due to the planetary 2018 dust storm on Mars, &quot;Opportunity&quot; ceased communications on June 10 and entered hibernation on June 12, 2018. It was hoped it would reboot once the weather cleared, but it did not, suggesting either a catastrophic failure or that a layer of dust had covered its solar panels. NASA hoped to re-establish contact with the rover, citing a recurring windy period which was forecast for November 2018 to January 2019, that could potentially clean off its solar panels. On February 13, 2019, NASA officials declared that the &quot;Opportunity&quot; mission was complete, after the spacecraft had failed to respond to over 1,000 signals sent since August 2018.

== Objectives ==
The scientific objectives of the Mars Exploration Rover mission were to:

*Search for and characterize a variety of rocks and soils that hold clues to past water activity. In particular, samples sought include those that have minerals deposited by water-related processes such as precipitation, evaporation, sedimentary cementation, or hydrothermal activity.
*Determine the distribution and composition of minerals, rocks, and soils surrounding the landing sites.
*Determine what geologic processes have shaped the local terrain and influenced the chemistry. Such processes could include water or wind erosion, sedimentation, hydrothermal mechanisms, volcanism, and cratering.
*Perform calibration and validation of surface observations made by Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) instruments. This will help determine the accuracy and effectiveness of various instruments that survey Martian geology from orbit.
*Search for iron-containing minerals, and to identify and quantify relative amounts of specific mineral types that contain water or were formed in water, such as iron-bearing carbonates.
*Characterize the mineralogy and textures of rocks and soils to determine the processes that created them.
*Search for geological clues to the environmental conditions that existed when liquid water was present.
*Assess whether those environments were conducive to life.

==Mission timeline==


&quot;Opportunity&quot; and &quot;Spirit&quot; rovers were part of the Mars Exploration Rover program in the long-term Mars Exploration Program. The Mars Exploration Program&#x27;s four principal goals were to determine if the potential for life exists on Mars (in particular, whether recoverable water may be found on Mars), to characterize the Mars climate and its geology, and then to prepare for a potential human mission to Mars. The Mars Exploration Rovers were to travel across the Martian surface and perform periodic geologic analyses to determine if water ever existed on Mars as well as the types of minerals available, as well as to corroborate data taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). Both rovers were designed with an expected 90 sols (92 Earth days) lifetime, but each lasted much longer than expected. &quot;Spirit&quot; mission lasted 20 times longer than its expected lifetime, and its mission was declared ended on May 25, 2011, after it got stuck in soft sand and expended its power reserves trying to free itself. &quot;Opportunity&quot; lasted 55 times longer than its 90 sol planned lifetime, operating for days from landing to mission end. An archive of weekly updates on the rover&#x27;s status can be found at the &quot;Opportunity&quot; Update Archive. 

===Launch and landing ===
&quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot; were launched a month apart, on June 10 and July 8, 2003, and both reached the Martian surface by January 2004. &quot;Opportunity&quot;″s launch was managed by NASA&#x27;s Launch Services Program. This was the first launch of the Delta II Heavy. The launch period went from June 25 to July 15, 2003. The first launch attempt occurred on June 28, 2003, but the spacecraft launched nine days later on July 7, 2003, due to delays for range safety and winds, then later to replace items on the rocket (insulation and a battery). Each day had two instantaneous launch opportunities. On the day of launch, the launch was delayed to the second opportunity (11:18 p.m. EDT) in order to fix a valve.

On January 25, 2004 (GMT) (January 24, 2004, PST), the airbag-protected landing craft settled onto the surface of Mars in the Eagle crater.

From its initial landing into an impact crater amidst an otherwise generally flat plain, &quot;Opportunity&quot; successfully investigated regolith and rock samples and took panoramic photos of its landing site. Its sampling allowed NASA scientists to make hypotheses concerning the presence of hematite and past presence of water on the surface of Mars. Following this, it was directed to travel across the surface of Mars to investigate another crater site, Endurance crater, which it explored from June to December 2004. Subsequently, &quot;Opportunity&quot; examined the impact site of its own heat shield and discovered an intact meteorite, now known as Heat Shield Rock, on the surface of Mars.

&quot;Opportunity&quot; was directed to proceed in a southerly direction to Erebus crater, a large, shallow, partially buried crater and a stopover on the way south towards Victoria crater, between October 2005 and March 2006. It experienced some mechanical problems with its robotic arm.

In late September 2006, &quot;Opportunity&quot; reached Victoria crater and explored along the rim in a clockwise direction. In June 2007 it returned to Duck Bay, its original arrival point at Victoria crater; in September 2007 it entered the crater to begin a detailed study. In August 2008, &quot;Opportunity&quot; left Victoria crater for Endeavour crater, which it reached on August 9, 2011.

At the rim of the Endeavour crater, the rover moved around a geographic feature named &quot;Cape York&quot;. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter had detected phyllosilicates there, and the rover analyzed the rocks with its instruments to check this sighting on the ground. This structure was analyzed in depth until summer 2013. In May 2013 the rover was heading south to a hill named &quot;Solander Point&quot;.

&quot;Opportunity&quot;″s total odometry by June 10, 2018 (sol 5111), was , while the dust factor was 10.8. Since January 2013, the solar array dust factor (one of the determinants of solar power production) varied from a relatively dusty 0.467 on December 5, 2013 (sol 3507), to a relatively clean 0.964 on May 13, 2014 (sol 3662).

In December 2014, NASA reported that &quot;Opportunity&quot; was suffering from &quot;amnesia&quot; events in which the rover failed to write data, e.g. telemetry information, to non-volatile memory. The hardware failure was believed to be due to an age-related fault in one of the rover&#x27;s seven memory banks. As a result, NASA had aimed to force the rover&#x27;s software to ignore the failed memory bank; amnesia events continued to occur, however, which eventually resulted in vehicle resets. In light of this, on Sol 4027 (May 23, 2015), the rover was configured to operate in RAM-only mode, completely avoiding the use of non-volatile memory for storage.

===End of mission===

In early June 2018, a large planetary-scale dust storm developed, and within a few days the rover&#x27;s solar panels were not generating enough power to maintain communications, with the last contact on June 10, 2018. NASA stated that they did not expect to resume communication until after the storm subsided, but the rover kept silent even after the storm ended in early October, suggesting either a catastrophic failure or a layer of dust covering its solar panels. The team remained hopeful that a windy period between November 2018 and January 2019 might clear the dust from its solar panels, as had happened before. Wind was detected nearby on January 8, and on January 26 the mission team announced a plan to begin broadcasting a new set of commands to the rover in case its radio receiver failed.

On February 12, 2019, past and present members of the mission team gathered in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)&#x27;s Space Flight Operations Facility to watch final commands being transmitted to Opportunity via the dish of the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex in California. Following 25 minutes of transmission of the final 4 sets of commands, communication attempts with the rover were handed off to Canberra, Australia.

More than 835 recovery commands were transmitted since losing signal in June 2018 to the end of January 2019 with over 1000 recovery commands transmitted before February 13, 2019. NASA officials held a press conference on February 13 to declare an official end to the mission. NASA associate administrator Thomas Zurbuchen said, &quot;It is therefore that I am standing here with a deep sense of appreciation and gratitude that I declare the &quot;Opportunity&quot; mission is complete.&quot; As NASA ended their attempts to contact the rover, the last data sent was the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Seeing You&quot; performed by Billie Holiday. Assets that had been needed to support &quot;Opportunity&quot; were transitioned to support the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover and the then-upcoming &quot;Perseverance&quot; rover.

The final communication from the rover came on June 10, 2018 (sol 5111) from Perseverance Valley, and indicated a solar array energy production of 22 Watt-hours for the sol, and the highest atmospheric opacity (tau) ever measured on Mars: 10.8.

==Design and construction==


&quot;Opportunity &quot; (and its twin, &quot;Spirit&quot;) are six-wheeled, solar-powered robots standing high, wide and long and weighing . Six wheels on a rocker-bogie system enabled mobility over rough terrain. Each wheel had its own motor. The vehicle was steered at front and rear and was designed to operate safely at tilts of up to 30 degrees. The maximum speed was ; , although the average speed was about . Both &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot; have pieces of the fallen World Trade Center&#x27;s metal on them that were &quot;turned into shields to protect cables on the drilling mechanisms&quot;.

Solar arrays generated about 140 watts for up to fourteen hours per sol, while rechargeable lithium ion batteries stored energy for use at night. &quot;Opportunity&quot;″s onboard computer uses a 20 MHz RAD6000 CPU with 128 MB of DRAM and 3 MB of EEPROM. The rover&#x27;s operating temperature ranges from and radioisotope heaters provide a base level of heating, assisted by electrical heaters when necessary.

Communications depended on an omnidirectional low-gain antenna communicating at a low data rate and a steerable high-gain antenna, both in direct contact with Earth. A low-gain antenna was also used to relay data to spacecraft orbiting Mars.

===Science payload===

The science instruments included:

* Panoramic Camera (Pancam) – examined the texture, color, mineralogy, and structure of the local terrain.
* Navigation Camera (Navcam) – monochrome with a higher field of view but lower resolution, for navigation and driving.
* Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES) – identified promising rocks and soils for closer examination, and determined the processes that formed them.
* Hazcams, two B&amp;W cameras with 120 degree field of view, that provided additional data about the rover&#x27;s surroundings.

The rover arm held the following instruments:

* Mössbauer spectrometer (MB) MIMOS II – used for close-up investigations of the mineralogy of iron-bearing rocks and soils.
* Alpha particle X-ray spectrometer (APXS) – close-up analysis of the abundances of elements that make up rocks and soils.
* Magnets – for collecting magnetic dust particles.
* Microscopic Imager (MI) – obtained close-up, high-resolution images of rocks and soils.
* Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT) – exposed fresh material for examination by instruments on board.

&quot;Opportunity&quot; was &#x27;driven&#x27; by several operators throughout its mission, including JPL roboticist Vandi Verma.

===Power===
The rover uses a combination of solar cells and a rechargeable chemical battery. This class of rover has two rechargeable lithium batteries, each composed of 8 cells with 8 amp-hour capacity. At the start of the mission the solar panels could provide up to around 900 watt-hours (Wh) per day to recharge the battery and power system in one Sol, but this could vary due to a variety of factors. In Eagle crater the cells were producing about 840 Wh per day, but by Sol 319 in December 2004, it had dropped to 730 Wh per day.

Like Earth, Mars has seasonal variations that reduce sunlight during winter. However, since the Martian year is longer than that of the Earth, the seasons fully rotate roughly once every 2 Earth years. By 2016, MER-B had endured seven Martian winters, during which times power levels drop which can mean the rover avoids doing activities that use a lot of power. During its first winter power levels dropped to under 300 Wh per day for two months, but some later winters were not as bad.

Another factor that can reduce received power is dust in the atmosphere, especially dust storms. Dust storms have occurred quite frequently when Mars is closest to the Sun. Global dust storms in 2007 reduced power levels for &quot;Opportunity&quot; and &quot;Spirit&quot; so much they could only run for a few minutes each day. Due to the 2018 dust storms on Mars, &quot;Opportunity&quot; entered hibernation mode on June 12, but it remained silent after the storm subsided in early October.

== Scientific findings ==
&quot;Opportunity&quot; has provided substantial evidence in support of the mission&#x27;s primary scientific goals: to search for and characterize a wide range of rocks and regolith that hold clues to past water activity on Mars. In addition to investigating the water, &quot;Opportunity&quot; has also obtained astronomical observations and atmospheric data.

== Legacy and honors ==
Following its launch, &quot;Opportunity&quot; was anthropomorphized by its operators: the rover was called a &quot;she,&quot; drawing from nautical tradition, and given an affectionate nickname, &quot;Oppy.&quot; One scientist, who worked with &quot;Opportunity&quot; for over a decade, attributed this to the rover&#x27;s unexpectedly long lifespan, which he called a story of &quot;an underdog beating the odds,&quot; and its &quot;familiar, almost biologically inspired shape.&quot; The media attention surrounding &quot;Opportunity&quot;&#x27;s shutdown spread this usage to the general public.

With word on February 12, 2019, that NASA was likely to conclude the &quot;Opportunity&quot; mission, many media outlets and commentators issued statements praising the mission&#x27;s success and stating their goodbyes to the rover. One journalist, Jacob Margolis, tweeted his translation of the last data transmission sent by &quot;Opportunity&quot; on June 10, 2018, as &quot;My battery is low and it&#x27;s getting dark.&quot; The phrase struck a chord with the public, inspiring a period of mourning, artwork, and tributes to the memory of &quot;Opportunity&quot;.

When the quote became widely reported, some news reports mistakenly asserted that the rover sent that exact message in English, resulting in NASA being inundated with additional questions. Margolis wrote a clarifying article on February 16, making it clear he had taken statements from NASA officials who were interpreting the data sent by &quot;Opportunity&quot;, both on the state of its low power and Mars&#x27;s high atmospheric opacity, and rephrased them in a poetic manner, never to imply the rover had sent the specific words.

Honoring &quot;Opportunity&quot;&#x27;s great contribution to the exploration of Mars, an asteroid was named Opportunity: 39382 Opportunity. The name was proposed by Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld who, along with Cornelis Johannes van Houten and Tom Gehrels, discovered the asteroid on September 24, 1960. &quot;Opportunity&quot;″s lander is &quot;Challenger Memorial Station&quot;.

On March 24, 2015, NASA celebrated &quot;Opportunity&quot; having traveled the distance of a marathon race, . The rover covered the distance in 11 years and 2 months. The JPL technicians celebrated the occasion by running a race.

A documentary film, &quot;Good Night Oppy&quot;, about the &quot;Opportunity&quot;, &quot;Spirit&quot;, and their long missions, was directed by Ryan White, and included support from JPL and Industrial Light &amp; Magic. It was released in 2022.

== Images ==
The rover could take pictures with its different cameras, but only the PanCam camera had the ability to photograph a scene with different color filters. The panorama views are usually built up from PanCam images. By February 3, 2018, &quot;Opportunity&quot; had returned 224,642 pictures.

<text>The Kumars at No. 42 is a British television sitcom. It won an International Emmy in 2002 and 2003, and won a Peabody Award in 2004. It ran for seven series totalling 53 episodes.

==Plot==
The show stars a fictional British Indian family, including Madhuri and Ashwin Kumar (played by Indira Joshi and Vincent Ebrahim), their adult son Sanjeev (played by Sanjeev Bhaskar), and Sushila, Sanjeev&#x27;s grandmother, normally referred to as Ummi (played by Meera Syal, later Bhaskar&#x27;s real-life wife). The family lives in Wembley, London, England. The show&#x27;s central premise is that Sanjeev&#x27;s parents have supported his dream of being a television presenter by having a TV studio built on what used to be their back garden. Running gags include Sanjeev&#x27;s apparent social ineptitude, Ashwin&#x27;s obsession with financial matters and his tendency to tell long stories with no real point and Ummi&#x27;s stories of her absurd exploits with her childhood friend Saraswati the bicycle (so named because of her contortionist skills). It is also a regular conceit that the guests&#x27; appearance fees are paid in Bimla&#x27;s chutney.

The show has an improvisational feel, though in reality much of the regular cast&#x27;s performance was scripted but the guest interviews were not. In the early episodes only Meera Syal improvised to any great extent though as the cast became accustomed to their characters, the improvised content increased for later episodes. Bhaskar stated in a 2009 interview, &quot;We never rehearsed the guests, and the best ones were the ones to keep the ball in the air.&quot;

==Production==
When talking about &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; for the British Book Awards, Sanjeev Bhaskar stated that he chose 42 as the house number because in the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; series 42 features prominently as the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything.

Sanjeev Bhaskar told interviewer Mark Lawson in August 2007 that the inspiration for the series was an embarrassing evening when he took a girlfriend to meet his parents. They asked her awkward questions and he wondered how they would react if he invited a famous person to his home. Ashwin and Madhuri are exaggerated versions of his own parents.

The show&#x27;s UK debut was on 12 November 2001 on BBC Two. It was produced by Hat Trick Productions and Pariah Television. Seven series of the programme have aired on BBC Two (and latterly on BBC One), with the seventh shown in 2006. In an interview for &quot;Radio Times&quot; in May 2007, Bhaskar confirmed that the show had run its course and there were no plans for any further series.

The Kumars also made a guest appearance on the 2003 Comic Relief single &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot; performed by Gareth Gates. They also starred in the video. It reached number 1 in the charts and sold more than 550,000 copies.

==International==
&quot;The Kumars at Number 42&quot; was shown in Asia (including India and Malaysia) on the Star World satellite TV channel and on SABC in South Africa. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation screened it in Australia. Its previous time slot, being right before hugely successful Australian comedy &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot;, made the programme successful there. It was very popular in New Zealand as well, where it was screened by Television New Zealand. It has been broadcast in the United States on BBC America, and in Canada on BBC Canada, a digital cable channel. It was shown in Sweden, as &quot;Curry Curry talkshow&quot;, by SVT2 in 2004, in the Netherlands on the public broadcasting foundation NPS (Nederland 3), in Switzerland on Swiss TV station DRS, and in India on Comedy Central.

In August 2002, the American network NBC entered a deal to buy the format but later dropped out.

A new version of the show was planned for Sunday evenings on Fox, restyled as a show in the 2003-04 season featuring a Latino-American family called &quot;The Ortegas&quot; and featuring Cheech Marin. However the program was dropped from Fox&#x27;s post-baseball playoffs schedule to focus the network&#x27;s schedule on the success of &quot;The O.C.&quot; at the time, and became another one of Fox&#x27;s series which were scheduled, but never made it to air. Six episodes were produced, but never aired.

The Australian version, &quot;Greeks on the Roof&quot; (featuring Greek Australians), debuted in 2003 but was soon taken off the air because of very low ratings.

ARY Digital has produced a Pakistani version of the show called &quot;Ghaffar at Dhoraji&quot; featuring a Gujarati family living in Karachi. Sony Television has produced an Indian version of the show called &quot;Batliwalla House No. 43&quot; featuring a Parsee family living in Mumbai.

In Russia, Channel One made the Armenian version of the show called &quot;Rubik Vsemogushchiy&quot; (en: &quot;Rubik Allmighty&quot;; &quot;Rubik&quot; is a short for the Armenian name &quot;Ruben&quot;). The idea of the show was that an Armenian named Rubik (played by Ruben Dzhaginyan) and his family interview the Russian stars (such as pop singers Vera Brezhneva and Anna Semenovich; TV presenters Dmitri Dibrov, Timur Rodriguez (real name Timur Yunusov), Valdis Pelsh and Sergei Svetlakov; and actors Igor Vernik and Anastasia Zavorotnyuk). There were just four episodes of the show, and it was soon taken off the air because of generally negative reviews from critics.

==Revivals==
On 1 May 2012, it was announced that a pilot for a revival of the show would be produced by Hat Trick Productions as The Kumars at No. 42B for Sky 1. The pilot was said to focus on a divorced Sanjeev and his family who now live in a flat (No. 42B) behind their Hounslow gift shop.

A 6-episode series was commissioned after a successful pilot, renamed simply to The Kumars, which started on 15 January 2014.

<text>Maumee Bay on Lake Erie is located in the U.S. state of Ohio, just east of the city of Toledo. The bay and the surrounding wetlands form most of the Maumee River basin, and in 1975 part of the area was incorporated into Maumee Bay State Park. The park is not huge, covering , but its wetlands feature some of the best bird watching in the United States. The Maumee Bay area is a popular vacation spot in the Midwest, featuring several resorts and a golf course.

<doc id="421058" wikidata="Q617214" url="?curid=421058" title="XQuartz">
<text>XQuartz is an open-source version of the X.Org X server, a display server for the X Window System (sometimes shortened to X11 or X) that runs on macOS. In 2012, it formally replaced Apple&#x27;s internal X11 app for OS X Mountain Lion (version 10.8). The name &quot;XQuartz&quot; derives from Quartz, part of the macOS Core Graphics framework, to which XQuartz connects these applications. XQuartz allows cross-platform applications using X11 for the GUI to run on macOS, many of which are not specifically designed for macOS. This includes numerous scientific and academic software projects.

== History ==

X11.app was initially available as a downloadable public beta for Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar and later included as a standard package for Mac OS X 10.3 Panther. In Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger X11.app was an optional install included on the install DVD. Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, and Mac OS X 10.7 Lion installed X11.app by default, but from OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion on Apple dropped dedicated support for X11.app, with users being directed to the open source XQuartz project (to which Apple contributes) instead.

In Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, Apple&#x27;s X11 implemented X11 protocol release 6.6 (X11R6.6). This implementation includes an XFree86 4.4 based X11 window server, Quartz rootless window manager, libraries, and basic utilities such as xterm. &quot;Rootless&quot; means that X window applications show up on the Quartz desktop, appearing like any other windowed Quartz application (that is, not in a virtual desktop contained within another window). In Mac OS X Leopard, X11 was updated to use X.Org Server (X11R7.2) rather than XFree86. The source code for X11 is available from Apple. Some source code is available under the Apple Public Source License while the bulk is licensed under the MIT License.

== Current version ==
The current version of XQuartz is a DDX (Device Dependent X) included in the X.Org Server and implements support for hardware-accelerated 2D graphics (in versions prior to 2.1), hardware OpenGL acceleration and integration with Aqua, the macOS graphical user interface (GUI). As of version 2.8.0, XQuartz does not provide support for high-resolution Retina displays to X11 apps, which run in pixel-doubled mode on high-resolution displays.

== List of versions (since 2010) ==
==See also==

*MacX, X11 support on Classic Mac OS
*XWayland, to support X application under Wayland
*XDarwin, an implementation of X for macOS that preceded XQuartz, and supports versions of macOS before 10.3 unlike XQuartz

<doc id="421066" wikidata="Q184912" url="?curid=421066" title="Line doubler">
<text>A line doubler is a device or algorithm used to deinterlace video signals prior to display on a progressive scan display.

The main function of a deinterlacer is to take an interlaced video frame which consists of 60 two-field interlaced fields of an NTSC analogue video signal or 50 fields of a PAL signal, and create a progressive scan output. 
Cathode ray tube (CRT) based displays (both direct-view and projection) are capable of directly displaying both interlaced and progressive video, and therefore the line-doubling process is an optional step to enhance picture quality. Other types of displays are fixed pixel displays, including LCD displays, plasma displays, DLP projectors, and OLED displays, which are not scanned from top left to bottom right corners and generally cannot accept an interlaced signal &quot;directly&quot;, and so require some kind of deinterlacing. Often, this is built in to the display and transparent to the user. Progressive scan DVD players also feature a deinterlacer.

Line doubling is a literal way to deinterlace an interlaced signal, although the method used may differ. Typically the use of the term &quot;line doubler&quot; refers to a simple repeat of a scanline so that the lines in a field match the lines of a frame. However, this produces a &quot;bobbing&quot; effect and has led to this method of deinterlacing being referred to as &quot;bob deinterlacing&quot;. An iteration on bob deinterlacing is to average adjacent scanlines of two frames which can produce a smoother, although blurrier, image. This technique is referred to as &quot;blend deinterlacing&quot;.

Some line doublers are capable of using the former technique in moving areas and the latter in static areas (to avoid the &quot;bob&quot; effect), which improves overall sharpness.

Even if a line doubler employs the merging method it cannot be considered an inverse telecine device if a frame rate of 60p other than the original 24p is obtained. From this aspect of view some hyped progressive scan technologies (including Pioneer&#x27;s PureCinema Progressive Scan) bearing an inverse telecine insignia are thus overstated.

Line doublers have been replaced recently by video scalers which incorporate 3:2 pulldown removal and the ability to scale the image to the various screen resolutions used on modern projectors and displays. However, line doublers such as the Open Source Scan Converter have been developed to convert signals from older video game consoles and have found popularity among retro gaming enthusiasts due to their minimal contribution to input lag.

<doc id="421068" wikidata="Q281854" url="?curid=421068" title="Prenex normal form">
<text>A formula of the predicate calculus is in prenex [[Normal form (abstract rewriting)|normal form]] (PNF) if it is written as a string of quantifiers and bound variables, called the prefix, followed by a quantifier-free part, called the matrix. Together with the normal forms in propositional logic (e.g. disjunctive normal form or conjunctive normal form), it provides a canonical normal form useful in automated theorem proving. 

Every formula in classical logic is logically equivalent to a formula in prenex normal form. For example, if formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3 are quantifier-free formulas with the free variables shown then
:formula_4
is in prenex normal form with matrix formula_5, while
:formula_6
is logically equivalent but not in prenex normal form.

== Conversion to prenex form ==

Every first-order formula is logically equivalent (in classical logic) to some formula in prenex normal form. There are several conversion rules that can be recursively applied to convert a formula to prenex normal form. The rules depend on which logical connectives appear in the formula. 

=== Conjunction and disjunction ===

The rules for conjunction and disjunction say that
:formula_7 is equivalent to formula_8 under (mild) additional condition formula_9, or, equivalently, formula_10 (meaning that at least one individual exists),
:formula_11 is equivalent to formula_12;
and 
:formula_13 is equivalent to formula_14,
:formula_15 is equivalent to formula_16 under additional condition formula_9.
The equivalences are valid when formula_18 does not appear as a free variable of formula_19; if formula_18 does appear free in formula_19, one can rename the bound formula_18 in formula_23 and obtain the equivalent formula_24.

For example, in the language of rings,
:formula_25 is equivalent to formula_26,
but
:formula_27 is not equivalent to formula_28
because the formula on the left is true in any ring when the free variable &quot;x&quot; is equal to 0, while the formula on the right has no free variables and is false in any nontrivial ring. So formula_27 will be first rewritten as formula_30 and then put in prenex normal form formula_31.

=== Negation ===

The rules for negation say that 
:formula_32 is equivalent to formula_33 
and 
:formula_34 is equivalent to formula_35.

=== Implication ===

There are four rules for implication: two that remove quantifiers from the antecedent and two that remove quantifiers from the consequent. These rules can be derived by rewriting the implication
formula_36 as formula_37 and applying the rules for disjunction and negation above. As with the rules for disjunction, these rules require that the variable quantified in one subformula does not appear free in the other subformula. 

The rules for removing quantifiers from the antecedent are (note the change of quantifiers):
:formula_38 is equivalent to formula_39 (under the assumption that formula_9),
:formula_41 is equivalent to formula_42.
The rules for removing quantifiers from the consequent are:
:formula_43 is equivalent to formula_39 (under the assumption that formula_9),
:formula_46 is equivalent to formula_42.
For example, when the range of quantification is the non-negative natural number (viz. formula_48), the statement
:formula_49
is logically equivalent to the statement
:formula_50
The former statement says that if &quot;x&quot; is less than any natural number, then &quot;x&quot; is less than zero. The latter statement says that there exists some natural number &quot;n&quot; such that if &quot;x&quot; is less than &quot;n&quot;, then &quot;x&quot; is less than zero. Both statements are true. The former statement is true because if &quot;x&quot; is less than any natural number, it must be less than the smallest natural number (zero). The latter statement is true because &quot;n=0&quot; makes the implication a tautology.

Note that the placement of brackets implies the scope of the quantification, which is very important for the meaning of the formula. Consider the following two statements:
:formula_51
and its logically equivalent statement
:formula_52
The former statement says that for any natural number &quot;n&quot;, if &quot;x&quot; is less than &quot;n&quot; then &quot;x&quot; is less than zero. The latter statement says that if there exists some natural number &quot;n&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; is less than &quot;n&quot;, then &quot;x&quot; is less than zero. Both statements are false. The former statement doesn&#x27;t hold for &quot;n=2&quot;, because &quot;x=1&quot; is less than &quot;n&quot;, but not less than zero. The latter statement doesn&#x27;t hold for &quot;x=1&quot;, because the natural number &quot;n=2&quot; satisfies &quot;x&lt;n&quot;, but &quot;x=1&quot; is not less than zero.

=== Example ===

Suppose that formula_53, formula_19, and formula_55 are quantifier-free formulas and no two of these formulas share any free variable. Consider the formula
:formula_56.
By recursively applying the rules starting at the innermost subformulas, the following sequence of logically equivalent formulas can be obtained:
:formula_56.
:formula_58,
:formula_59,
:formula_60,
:formula_61,
:formula_62,
:formula_63,
:formula_64.
This is not the only prenex form equivalent to the original formula. For example, by dealing with the consequent before the antecedent in the example above, the prenex form
:formula_65
can be obtained: 
:formula_66
:formula_67,
:formula_68,
:formula_69.
The ordering of the two universal quantifier with the same scope doesn&#x27;t change the meaning/truth value of the statement.

=== Intuitionistic logic ===

The rules for converting a formula to prenex form make heavy use of classical logic. In intuitionistic logic, it is not true that every formula is logically equivalent to a prenex formula. The negation connective is one obstacle, but not the only one. The implication operator is also treated differently in intuitionistic logic than classical logic; in intuitionistic logic, it is not definable using disjunction and negation. 

The BHK interpretation illustrates why some formulas have no intuitionistically-equivalent prenex form. In this interpretation, a proof of 
:formula_70
is a function which, given a concrete &quot;x&quot; and a proof of formula_71, produces a concrete &quot;y&quot; and a proof of formula_72. In this case it is allowable for the value of &quot;y&quot; to be computed from the given value of &quot;x&quot;. A proof of 
:formula_73
on the other hand, produces a single concrete value of &quot;y&quot; and a function that converts any proof of formula_74 into a proof of formula_72. If each &quot;x&quot; satisfying formula_53 can be used to construct a &quot;y&quot; satisfying formula_19 but no such &quot;y&quot; can be constructed without knowledge of such an &quot;x&quot; then formula (1) will not be equivalent to formula (2).

The rules for converting a formula to prenex form that do &quot;fail&quot; in intuitionistic logic are:
:(1) formula_78 implies formula_11,
:(2) formula_78 implies formula_81,
:(3) formula_82 implies formula_39,
:(4) formula_43 implies formula_39,
:(5) formula_34 implies formula_35,
(&quot;x&quot; does not appear as a free variable of formula_88 in (1) and (3); &quot;x&quot; does not appear as a free variable of formula_89 in (2) and (4)).

== Use of prenex form ==

Some proof calculi will only deal with a theory whose formulae are written in prenex normal form. The concept is essential for developing the arithmetical hierarchy and the analytical hierarchy.

Gödel&#x27;s proof of his completeness theorem for first-order logic presupposes that all formulae have been recast in prenex normal form.

Tarski&#x27;s axioms for geometry is a logical system whose sentences can &quot;all&quot; be written in universal–existential form, a special case of the prenex normal form that has every universal quantifier preceding any existential quantifier, so that all sentences can be rewritten in the form formula_90 formula_91 formula_92 formula_93 formula_94 formula_53, where formula_53 is a sentence that does not contain any quantifier. This fact allowed Tarski to prove that Euclidean geometry is decidable.

<text>The Apple Public Source License (APSL) is the open-source and free software license under which Apple&#x27;s Darwin operating system was released in 2000. A free and open-source software license was voluntarily adopted to further involve the community from which much of Darwin originated.

The first version of the Apple Public Source License was approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). Version 2.0, released July 29, 2003, is also approved as a free software license by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) which finds it acceptable for developers to work on projects that are already covered by this license. However, the FSF recommends that developers should not release new projects under this license, because the partial copyleft is not compatible with the GNU General Public License and allows linking with files released entirely as proprietary software. The license does require that if any derivatives of the original source are released externally, their source should be made available; the Free Software Foundation compares this requirement to a similar one in its own GNU Affero General Public License.

Many software releases from Apple have now been relicensed under the more liberal Apache License, such as the Bonjour Zeroconf stack. However, most OS component source code remains under APSL.

<text>Robert Stuart Fitzgerald (12 October 1910 – 16 January 1985) was an American poet, literary critic and translator whose renderings of the Greek classics &quot;became standard works for a generation of scholars and students&quot;. He was best known as a translator of ancient Greek and Latin. He also composed several books of his own poetry.

==Biography==
Fitzgerald grew up in Springfield, Illinois, and graduated from The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut. He entered Harvard in 1929, and in 1931 a number of his poems were published in &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine. After graduating from Harvard in 1933 he became a reporter for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; for a year.

Later he worked for several years for &quot;Time&quot;. In 1940, William Saroyan lists him among &quot;associate editors&quot; at &quot;Time&quot; in the play, &quot;Love&#x27;s Old Sweet Song&quot;. Whittaker Chambers mentions him as a colleague in his 1952 memoir, &quot;Witness&quot;.

In World War II, he served in the U.S. Navy in Guam and Pearl Harbor. Later he was an instructor at Sarah Lawrence and Princeton University, poetry editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot;. He succeeded Archibald MacLeish as Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard in 1965 and served until his retirement in 1981.

He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets. From 1984 to 1985 he was appointed Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress, a position now known as Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry, the United States&#x27; equivalent of a national poet laureate, but did not serve due to illness. In 1984 Fitzgerald received a L.H.D. from Bates College.

Fitzgerald is widely known as one of the most poetic translators into the English language. He also served as literary executor to Flannery O&#x27;Connor, who was a boarder at his home in Redding, Connecticut, from 1949 to 1951. Fitzgerald&#x27;s wife at the time, Sally Fitzgerald, compiled O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s essays and letters after O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s death. Benedict Fitzgerald (who co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; with Mel Gibson), Barnaby Fitzgerald, and Michael Fitzgerald are sons of Robert and Sally.

Fitzgerald was married three times. He later moved to Hamden, Connecticut, where he died at his home after a long illness.

<doc id="421074" wikidata="Q1090524" url="?curid=421074" title="Skolem normal form">
<text>In mathematical logic, a formula of first-order logic is in Skolem normal form if it is in prenex normal form with only universal first-order quantifiers. 

Every first-order formula may be converted into Skolem normal form while not changing its satisfiability via a process called Skolemization (sometimes spelled Skolemnization). The resulting formula is not necessarily equivalent to the original one, but is equisatisfiable with it: it is satisfiable if and only if the original one is satisfiable.

Reduction to Skolem normal form is a method for removing existential quantifiers from formal logic statements, often performed as the first step in an automated theorem prover. 
== Examples ==

The simplest form of Skolemization is for existentially quantified variables that are not inside the scope of a universal quantifier. These may be replaced simply by creating new constants. For example, formula_1 may be changed to formula_2, where formula_3 is a new constant (does not occur anywhere else in the formula).

More generally, Skolemization is performed by replacing every existentially quantified variable formula_4 with a term formula_5 whose function symbol formula_6 is new. The variables of this term are as follows. If the formula is in prenex normal form, then formula_7 are the variables that are universally quantified and whose quantifiers precede that of formula_4. In general, they are the variables that are quantified universally (we assume we get rid of existential quantifiers in order, so all existential quantifiers before formula_9 have been removed) and such that formula_9 occurs in the scope of their quantifiers. The function formula_6 introduced in this process is called a Skolem function (or Skolem constant if it is of zero arity) and the term is called a Skolem term.
As an example, the formula formula_12 is not in Skolem normal form because it contains the existential quantifier formula_9. Skolemization replaces formula_4 with formula_15, where formula_6 is a new function symbol, and removes the quantification over The resulting formula is formula_17. The Skolem term formula_15 contains formula_19, but not formula_20, because the quantifier to be removed formula_9 is in the scope of formula_22, but not in that of formula_23; since this formula is in prenex normal form, this is equivalent to saying that, in the list of quantifiers, formula_19 precedes formula_4 while formula_20 does not. The formula obtained by this transformation is satisfiable if and only if the original formula is.

==How Skolemization works==

Skolemization works by applying a second-order equivalence together with the definition of first-order satisfiability. The equivalence provides a way for &quot;moving&quot; an existential quantifier before a universal one. 

:formula_27
where
:formula_15 is a function that maps formula_19 to formula_4.

Intuitively, the sentence &quot;for every formula_19 there exists a formula_4 such that formula_33&quot; is converted into the equivalent form &quot;there exists a function formula_6 mapping every formula_19 into a formula_4 such that, for every formula_19 it holds that formula_38&quot;.

This equivalence is useful because the definition of first-order satisfiability implicitly existentially quantifies over functions interpreting the function symbols. In particular, a first-order formula formula_39 is satisfiable if there exists a model formula_40 and an evaluation formula_41 of the free variables of the formula that evaluate the formula to &quot;true&quot;. The model contains the interpretation of all function symbols; therefore, Skolem functions are implicitly existentially quantified. In the example above, formula_42 is satisfiable if and only if there exists a model formula_40, which contains an interpretation for formula_6, such that formula_42 is true for some evaluation of its free variables (none in this case). This may be expressed in second order as formula_46. By the above equivalence, this is the same as the satisfiability of formula_47.

At the meta-level, first-order satisfiability of a formula formula_39 may be written with a little abuse of notation as formula_49, where formula_40 is a model, formula_41 is an evaluation of the free variables, and formula_52 means that formula_39 is true in formula_40 under formula_41. Since first-order models contain the interpretation of all function symbols, any Skolem function that formula_39 contains is implicitly existentially quantified by formula_57. As a result, after replacing existential quantifiers over variables by existential quantifiers over functions at the front of the formula, the formula still may be treated as a first-order one by removing these existential quantifiers. This final step of treating formula_46 as formula_42 may be completed because functions are implicitly existentially quantified by formula_57 in the definition of first-order satisfiability.

Correctness of Skolemization may be shown on the example formula formula_61 as follows. This formula is satisfied by a model formula_40 if and only if, for each possible value for formula_63 in the domain of the model, there exists a value for formula_4 in the domain of the model that makes formula_65 true. By the axiom of choice, there exists a function formula_6 such that formula_67. As a result, the formula formula_68 is satisfiable, because it has the model obtained by adding the interpretation of formula_6 to formula_40. This shows that formula_71 is satisfiable only if formula_72 is satisfiable as well. Conversely, if formula_72 is satisfiable, then there exists a model formula_74 that satisfies it; this model includes an interpretation for the function formula_6 such that, for every value of formula_63, the formula formula_77 holds. As a result, formula_71 is satisfied by the same model because one may choose, for every value of formula_7, the value formula_80, where formula_6 is evaluated according to formula_74.

==Uses of Skolemization==
One of the uses of Skolemization is within automated theorem proving. For example, in the method of analytic tableaux, whenever a formula whose leading quantifier is existential occurs, the formula obtained by removing that quantifier via Skolemization may be generated. For example, if formula_83 occurs in a tableau, where formula_84 are the free variables of formula_85, then formula_86 may be added to the same branch of the tableau. This addition does not alter the satisfiability of the tableau: every model of the old formula may be extended, by adding a suitable interpretation of formula_6, to a model of the new formula.

This form of Skolemization is an improvement over &quot;classical&quot; Skolemization in that only variables that are free in the formula are placed in the Skolem term. This is an improvement because the semantics of tableaux may implicitly place the formula in the scope of some universally quantified variables that are not in the formula itself; these variables are not in the Skolem term, while they would be there according to the original definition of Skolemization. Another improvement that may be used is applying the same Skolem function symbol for formulae that are identical up to variable renaming.

Another use is in the resolution method for first-order logic, where formulas are represented as sets of clauses understood to be universally quantified. (For an example see drinker paradox.)

An important result in model theory is the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, which can be proven via Skolemizing the theory and closing under the resulting Skolem functions.

==Skolem theories==
In general, if formula_88 is a theory and for each formula with free variables formula_89 there is an &quot;n&quot;-ary function symbol formula_90 that is provably a Skolem function for formula_4, then formula_88 is called a Skolem theory.

Every Skolem theory is model complete, i.e. every substructure of a model is an elementary substructure. Given a model &quot;M&quot; of a Skolem theory &quot;T&quot;, the smallest substructure of &quot;M&quot; containing a certain set &quot;A&quot; is called the Skolem hull of &quot;A&quot;. The Skolem hull of &quot;A&quot; is an atomic prime model over &quot;A&quot;.

== History ==
Skolem normal form is named after the late Norwegian mathematician Thoralf Skolem.

<doc id="421077" wikidata="Q1184892" url="?curid=421077" title="Delta Force (video game)">
<text>Delta Force is a tactical first-person shooter developed and published by NovaLogic. It was released for the Windows in October 1998. &quot;Delta Force&quot; was designed to be a military simulation loosely based on the United States&#x27; Delta Force special operations army unit.

The game was a critical and commercial success and it, along with a number of other high profile FPS games at the time, helped to popularize and define the &quot;tactical shooter&quot; genre.

==Gameplay==

The player assumes the role of a Delta Force operator who takes part in military operations in various theatres, and may customize their in-game avatar during the game&#x27;s menu screen, selecting from various faces, as well as selecting a male or female operator. Objectives typically involve the elimination of a hostile presence in a region, assassinating a high-profile target, destroying military equipment or escorting POWs or civilians to an extraction point. Depending on the mission the player also needs to make it to an extraction point himself after fulfilling all other objectives. All five campaigns are available from the start and additional missions are unlocked as previous ones are completed. Sometimes multiple missions are unlocked at once and it is up to the player which order to play them in. The game features 40 missions in total, specifically taking place in Peru, Chad, Indonesia, Uzbekistan, and Novaya Zemlya.

The AI in the game varies depending on the difficulty you choose, as well as varying in spawn location from play-through to play-through. The lower the difficulty, the worse their aim is and the less they react and move around relative to the player. The higher the difficulty, the better their aim is, the faster they lock on to the player&#x27;s location, and they use more advanced tactics, such as moving in small groups and providing cover fire while the others advance.

===Equipment===
Before each mission the player is able to choose his equipment. Default loadouts differ from mission to mission but the player can exchange it without any restrictions. The inventory is based on three slots: one for the main weapon, one for extra equipment and one for a sidearm. Unlike many other shooters of the era, bullets are actual objects in the game with simulated ballistics which account for drop and time to reach targets, requiring the player to lead targets that are far enough away.

On all of the maps, there are also scattered pickups that the player can use to their advantage. The player can decide whether to turn these on or off in the settings menu. Ammo pickups refill ammo, while medical pickups restore player health (despite player health not being visible through the HUD).

===Multiplayer===
Delta Force also features LAN and online multiplayer for up to 32 players. All missions from the singleplayer campaign can be played cooperatively with additional players replacing the AI-controlled Delta Force operatives. Additionally deathmatch, king of the hill and capture the flag are available, along with team variations.

==Development==
Delta Force uses NovaLogic&#x27;s own proprietary Voxel Space engine, known from their earlier games such as the Comanche series, which uses voxels to visualise terrain while polygons are used for rendering characters, vehicles, buildings and other details. This method allowed for draw distances and terrain detail unseen in first person shooters at the time and supported the game&#x27;s attempt to simulate realistic outdoor combat at distances of up to several hundred meters. A limitation of the engine was that it did not support any form of 3D acceleration.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to video game review aggregator GameRankings. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Michael Ryan called it &quot;a very impressive game overall&quot;, particularly praising the game&#x27;s mission and sound design, albeit pointing out its outdated visuals. He also drew comparisons to &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six&quot;, released earlier the same year, but noted Delta Force&#x27;s limited preparation options compared to the latter. He also praised the multiplayer mode but noted that technical problems made it hard to play. &quot;PC Gamer&quot;″s Todd Vaughn also drew comparisons to &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; but noted &quot;Delta Force&quot;&#x27;s focus on long-distance fights and lower level of realism. He concluded: &quot;Overall, Delta Force is a surprising and welcome addition to the genre that uses just the right mix [of] action and tactics to set itself apart from the crowd.&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; wrote, &quot;Though &quot;Delta Force&quot;″s standalone play is often uninspired, the multiplayer is one of the most satisfying gaming experiences available today.&quot;

==Sequels==
The game was successful enough to receive a direct sequel, &quot;Delta Force 2&quot;, the following year and spawn a long-running series. The last game in the series was &quot;Delta Force: Xtreme 2&quot;, released in 2009. Another game titled &quot;Delta Force: Angel Falls&quot; was announced but never released due to NovaLogic&#x27;s closure in 2016.

Inspired by the popularity of Ridley Scott&#x27;s war film &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;, chronicling the Battle of Mogadishu, NovaLogic developed a &quot;Delta Force&quot; game with the same theme titled &quot;Delta Force: Black Hawk Down&quot;, which was released in 2003. Due to the rise in popularity of military-themed multiplayer shooters with vehicular combat, most notably DICE&#x27;s &quot;Battlefield&quot; series, NovaLogic also developed a multiplayer focused spin-off of the &quot;Delta Force&quot; series titled &quot;Joint Operations: Typhoon Rising&quot;, released in 2004. In 2023, a &quot;Delta Force&quot; reboot (previously known as &quot;Delta Force: Hawk Ops&quot;) was announced.

<text>Medallions (the original Polish title: &quot;Medaliony&quot;) is a book consisting of eight short stories by the Polish author Zofia Nałkowska.

The book was originally published in 1946, soon after the end of World War II. In it, Nałkowska calmly related selected stories of Nazi atrocities in Poland and the fates of their victims. Nałkowska was a member of a special committee for the investigation of Nazi crimes that took place in Poland, where she had learned facts directly from victims and witnesses.

Part of the text was published in English in the &quot;Introduction to Modern Polish Literature&quot; edited by Adam Gillon and Ludwik Krzyżanowski. A complete translation by Diana Kuprel was published by the Northwestern University Press in 2000.

<doc id="421082" wikidata="Q4786520" url="?curid=421082" title="Archibald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso">
<text>Archibald Henry Macdonald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso, (22 October 1890 – 15 June 1970), known as Sir Archibald Sinclair between 1912 and 1952, and often as Archie Sinclair, was a British politician and leader of the Liberal Party.

==Background and education==
Sinclair was born in 1890 in Caithness, Scotland. Sinclair was the son Clarence Granville Sinclair, and his American wife Mabel Sands, daughter of Mahlon Day Sands, and half-sister of Ethel Sands. His mother died shortly after his birth, and his father in 1895. He was brought up in families including those of his paternal grandfather Sir Tollemache Sinclair, 3rd Baronet, his uncle William Macdonald Sinclair, and Owen Williams, married to his aunt Nina.

Educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Sinclair was commissioned into the Life Guards in 1910. In 1912, he succeeded his grandfather as the fourth Baronet of Ulbster. He became one of the largest landowners in the United Kingdom, owning an estate of about in Caithness. His recreations included polo and flying: he was a keen aviator. At this period he made a friend of Winston Churchill.

Colin Coote in his memoirs wrote of Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;irresistible charm, allied to the face and figure of an Adonis&quot;. The handsome Sinclair was at this period thought of as a possible husband for Nellie Hozier, younger sister of Clementine Churchill.

==Military career==

Sinclair served on the Western Front during World War I, in 1915 as aide de camp to J. E. B. Seely who commanded the Canadian Cavalry Brigade. He rose to the rank of Major in the Guards Machine Gun Regiment.

After Winston Churchill resigned as First Lord of the Admiralty, Sinclair served as his second-in-command when Churchill took up command at the beginning of 1916 of the 6th Battalion of the Royal Scots Fusiliers. Churchill arranged the transfer with Douglas Haig, who turned down the request that Seely should be moved too, and also refused him Edward Spears. They were stationed in the Ploegsteert Wood sector of the Western Front.

==Working with Churchill==
From 1919 to 1921 Sinclair served as Personal Military Secretary to Churchill, when he returned to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for War, and then accompanied him to the Colonial Office as Private Secretary.

Sinclair&#x27;s duties included acting as liaison for Churchill with the Secret Intelligence Service. He had dealings with George Alexander Hill and Malcolm Wollcombe, agent in the Soviet Union for Mansfield Smith-Cumming. Stewart Menzies who had the official liaison role at the War Office was a personal friend. Sinclair collated humint and technical intelligence for Churchill, for example on Leonid Krasin. He also assisted in the delicate handling of Boris Savinkov, who was brought to London. It was Sinclair who introduced the prominent British agent Sidney Reilly to Nikolai Alekseyev, intelligence chief of the White Russian leader Alexander Guchkov.

==Political career 1922–1939==
In 1922, Sinclair entered the House of Commons as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Caithness and Sutherland, supporting David Lloyd George and defeating the incumbent Liberal supporter of H. H. Asquith. He rose through the Liberal ranks as the party shrank in Parliament, becoming Chief Whip by 1930. At this period he worked on land policy with Lloyd George, including the &quot;Tartan Book&quot; that addressed Scottish devolution.

In July 1931, a meeting took place at Sinclair&#x27;s house, where Oswald Mosley and Harold Nicolson met Churchill, Lloyd George and Brendan Bracken, to discuss a political alliance. About a month later, the Liberal Party joined the National Government of Ramsay MacDonald, with Sinclair appointed Secretary of State for Scotland. He was sworn of the Privy Council at the same time. In 1932, he, together with other Liberal ministers led by Herbert Samuel, resigned from the government in protest at the Ottawa Conference introducing Imperial Preference.

In the 1935 general election, Herbert Samuel lost his seat, and Sinclair became the Liberal Party&#x27;s leader at the head of 20 MPs. During the Abdication Crisis of 1936, his name was put forward as a possible leader of a government that might be formed if Edward VIII held onto the throne against the wishes of the Baldwin administration. Churchill came to support the King&#x27;s position, and Lord Beaverbrook entertained the idea of Sinclair as Prime Minister. Both Clement Attlee for Labour and Sinclair for the Liberals, however, in late November ruled out forming a government under those circumstances.

Sinclair consistently opposed the continental dictatorships and kept the National Liberals at arms length. He supported the League of Nations and collective security. He backed, as did Attlee, Churchill&#x27;s book &quot;Arms and the Covenant&quot;. He joined the Anti-Nazi Council of Eugen Spier, with Churchill and Violet Bonham Carter, Margaret Bondfield and Hugh Dalton. Public opinion at this point of the later 1930s by no means agreed, and John Alfred Spender attacked Sinclair in &quot;The Times&quot; on foreign policy, claiming that he, like the League of Nations Union, wished for war with the Axis Powers.

At the time of the Munich Crisis in September 1938, Sinclair was one of the anti-appeasement group who gathered around Churchill, with Leo Amery, Robert Boothby, Robert Cecil, Harold Macmillan and Harold Nicolson. During parliamentary debate over the Munich Agreement he attacked Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain for &quot;wilting&quot; to Nazi Germany and tossing &quot;justice and respect for treaties... to the winds.&quot; On a personal level, Violet Bonham Carter was a frequent guest of the Sinclairs at Dalnawillan Lodge in the Flow Country, as were Harcourt Johnstone and Lady Gwendoline Churchill, wife of Jack Churchill and Winston&#x27;s sister-in-law. Bonham Carter was a Liberal activist, close follower of Churchill, anti-appeaser and League of Nations Union member.

==Second World War==
When Churchill formed an all-party coalition government in 1940, Sinclair entered the cabinet as Secretary of State for Air. During the May 1940 British war cabinet crisis after the fall of France he sided with Churchill against Lord Halifax&#x27;s plan to seek a negotiated settlement with Nazi Germany mediated by Fascist Italy.

Sinclair&#x27;s first task was to work with the Royal Air Force in planning the Battle of Britain. Towards the end of the war, he found himself at odds with Churchill, arguing against Bomber Harris&#x27; strategy for the Bombing of Dresden and other German cities. He was not a strong political personality: Max Hastings reports that he was often regarded as the &quot;Head of School&#x27;s fag&quot; to Churchill, and as the political mouthpiece rather than the master of Air Chief Marshals Portal and Harris. However, in 1942 he did convince Churchill and his cabinet not to carry out reprisals on German villages for war atrocities such as the Lidice massacre.

Sinclair remained a minister until May 1945, when the coalition ended. In the 1945 general election, he lost his seat. His margin of defeat was narrow: he came in third place, with the victor Eric Gandar Dower having 61 votes more.

==Last years==
At the 1950 general election, Sinclair again stood for his old seat, coming second. In 1952, the year of his first stroke, he accepted elevation to the House of Lords as Viscount Thurso of Ulbster in the County of Caithness. A more serious stroke in 1959 left him largely bedridden and in a state of precarious health, until he died at his home in Twickenham in 1970.

==Family==

In 1918 Sinclair married Marigold Forbes (1897–1975), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel James Stewart Forbes and Lady Angela Forbes. They had four children:

# Catherine (1919–2007), married 1957 Kazimierz Zielenkiewicz.
# Elizabeth (1921–1994), married in 1942 Archibald Michael Lyle, son of Sir Archibald Lyle, 2nd Baronet, and was mother of Veronica Linklater.
# Robin (1922–1995), married 1952 Margaret Beaumont Robertson, and was father of John Sinclair, 3rd Viscount Thurso
# Angus John (1925–2003), married firstly in 1955 Pamela Karen Bower, daughter of Dallas Bower (dissolved 1967), secondly in 1968 Judith Anne Percy (dissolved 1992), thirdly in 1992 Kate Fry.

==Legacy==
The Southern Railway named a Battle of Britain Class Light Pacific steam locomotive &quot;Sir Archibald Sinclair&quot;. The ceremonial naming of the locomotive was performed by Sir Archibald himself at Waterloo station on 24 February 1948. The SR number of the locomotive was 21C159 and its British Railways number was 34059.

<doc id="421085" wikidata="Q426592" url="?curid=421085" title="Paraconsistent logic">
<text>Paraconsistent logic is a type of non-classical logic that allows for the coexistence of contradictory statements without leading to a logical explosion where anything can be proven true. Specifically, paraconsistent logic is the subfield of logic that is concerned with studying and developing &quot;inconsistency-tolerant&quot; systems of logic, purposefully excluding the principle of explosion.

Inconsistency-tolerant logics have been discussed since at least 1910 (and arguably much earlier, for example in the writings of Aristotle); however, the term &quot;paraconsistent&quot; (&quot;beside the consistent&quot;) was first coined in 1976, by the Peruvian philosopher Francisco Miró Quesada Cantuarias. The study of paraconsistent logic has been dubbed paraconsistency, which encompasses the school of dialetheism.

==Definition==
In classical logic (as well as intuitionistic logic and most other logics), contradictions entail everything. This feature, known as the principle of explosion or &quot;ex contradictione sequitur quodlibet&quot; (Latin, &quot;from a contradiction, anything follows&quot;) can be expressed formally as

Which means: if &quot;P&quot; and its negation ¬&quot;P&quot; are both assumed to be true, then of the two claims &quot;P&quot; and (some arbitrary) &quot;A&quot;, at least one is true. Therefore, &quot;P&quot; or &quot;A&quot; is true. However, if we know that either &quot;P&quot; or &quot;A&quot; is true, and also that &quot;P&quot; is false (that ¬&quot;P&quot; is true) we can conclude that &quot;A&quot;, which could be anything, is true. Thus if a theory contains a single inconsistency, the theory is trivial – that is, it has every sentence as a theorem.

The characteristic or defining feature of a paraconsistent logic is that it rejects the principle of explosion. As a result, paraconsistent logics, unlike classical and other logics, can be used to formalize inconsistent but non-trivial theories.

==Comparison with classical logic==
The entailment relations of paraconsistent logics are propositionally &quot;weaker&quot; than classical logic; that is, they deem &quot;fewer&quot; propositional inferences valid. The point is that a paraconsistent logic can never be a propositional extension of classical logic, that is, propositionally validate every entailment that classical logic does. In some sense, then, paraconsistent logic is more conservative or cautious than classical logic. It is due to such conservativeness that paraconsistent languages can be more &quot;expressive&quot; than their classical counterparts including the hierarchy of metalanguages due to Alfred Tarski and others. According to Solomon Feferman: &quot;natural language abounds with directly or indirectly self-referential yet apparently harmless expressions—all of which are excluded from the Tarskian framework.&quot; This expressive limitation can be overcome in paraconsistent logic.

== Motivation ==
A primary motivation for paraconsistent logic is the conviction that it ought to be possible to reason with inconsistent information in a controlled and discriminating way. The principle of explosion precludes this, and so must be abandoned. In non-paraconsistent logics, there is only one inconsistent theory: the trivial theory that has every sentence as a theorem. Paraconsistent logic makes it possible to distinguish between inconsistent theories and to reason with them.

Research into paraconsistent logic has also led to the establishment of the philosophical school of dialetheism (most notably advocated by Graham Priest), which asserts that true contradictions exist in reality, for example groups of people holding opposing views on various moral issues. Being a dialetheist rationally commits one to some form of paraconsistent logic, on pain of otherwise embracing trivialism, i.e. accepting that all contradictions (and equivalently all statements) are true. However, the study of paraconsistent logics does not necessarily entail a dialetheist viewpoint. For example, one need not commit to either the existence of true theories or true contradictions, but would rather prefer a weaker standard like empirical adequacy, as proposed by Bas van Fraassen.

==Philosophy==
In classical logic, Aristotle&#x27;s three laws, namely, the excluded middle (&quot;p&quot; or ¬&quot;p&quot;), non-contradiction ¬ (&quot;p&quot; ∧ ¬&quot;p&quot;) and identity (&quot;p&quot; iff &quot;p&quot;), are regarded as the same, due to the inter-definition of the connectives. Moreover, traditionally contradictoriness (the presence of contradictions in a theory or in a body of knowledge) and triviality (the fact that such a theory entails all possible consequences) are assumed inseparable, granted that negation is available. These views may be philosophically challenged, precisely on the grounds that they fail to distinguish between contradictoriness and other forms of inconsistency.

On the other hand, it is possible to derive triviality from the &#x27;conflict&#x27; between consistency and contradictions, once these notions have been properly distinguished. The very notions of consistency and inconsistency may be furthermore internalized at the object language level.

==Tradeoffs==
Paraconsistency involves tradeoffs. In particular, abandoning the principle of explosion requires one to abandon at least one of the following two principles:
Both of these principles have been challenged.

One approach is to reject disjunction introduction but keep disjunctive syllogism and transitivity. In this approach, rules of natural deduction hold, except for disjunction introduction and excluded middle; moreover, inference A⊢B does not necessarily mean entailment A⇒B. Also, the following usual Boolean properties hold: double negation as well as associativity, commutativity, distributivity, De Morgan, and idempotence inferences (for conjunction and disjunction). Furthermore, inconsistency-robust proof of negation holds for entailment: (A⇒(B∧¬B))⊢¬A.

Another approach is to reject disjunctive syllogism. From the perspective of dialetheism, it makes perfect sense that disjunctive syllogism should fail. The idea behind this syllogism is that, if &quot;¬ A&quot;, then &quot;A&quot; is excluded and &quot;B&quot; can be inferred from &quot;A ∨ B&quot;. However, if &quot;A&quot; may hold as well as &quot;¬A&quot;, then the argument for the inference is weakened.

Yet another approach is to do both simultaneously. In many systems of relevant logic, as well as linear logic, there are two separate disjunctive connectives. One allows disjunction introduction, and one allows disjunctive syllogism. Of course, this has the disadvantages entailed by separate disjunctive connectives including confusion between them and complexity in relating them.

Furthermore, the rule of proof of negation (below) just by itself is inconsistency non-robust in the sense that the negation of every proposition can be proved from a contradiction.
Strictly speaking, having just the rule above is paraconsistent because it is not the case that &quot;every&quot; proposition can be proved from a contradiction. However, if the rule double negation elimination (formula_1) is added as well, then every proposition can be proved from a contradiction. Double negation elimination does not hold for intuitionistic logic.

== Logic of Paradox ==
One example of paraconsistent logic is the system known as LP (&quot;Logic of Paradox&quot;), first proposed by the Argentinian logician Florencio González Asenjo in 1966 and later popularized by Priest and others.

One way of presenting the semantics for LP is to replace the usual functional valuation with a relational one. The binary relation formula_2 relates a formula to a truth value: formula_3 means that formula_4 is true, and formula_5 means that formula_4 is false. A formula must be assigned &quot;at least&quot; one truth value, but there is no requirement that it be assigned &quot;at most&quot; one truth value. The semantic clauses for negation and disjunction are given as follows:
* formula_7
* formula_8
* formula_9
* formula_10
(The other logical connectives are defined in terms of negation and disjunction as usual.)
Or to put the same point less symbolically:
* &quot;not A&quot; is true if and only if &quot;A&quot; is false
* &quot;not A&quot; is false if and only if &quot;A&quot; is true
* &quot;A or B&quot; is true if and only if &quot;A&quot; is true or &quot;B&quot; is true
* &quot;A or B&quot; is false if and only if &quot;A&quot; is false and &quot;B&quot; is false
(Semantic) logical consequence is then defined as truth-preservation:
: formula_11 if and only if formula_4 is true whenever every element of formula_13 is true.
Now consider a valuation formula_2 such that formula_3 and formula_5 but it is not the case that formula_17. It is easy to check that this valuation constitutes a counterexample to both explosion and disjunctive syllogism. However, it is also a counterexample to modus ponens for the material conditional of LP. For this reason, proponents of LP usually advocate expanding the system to include a stronger conditional connective that is not definable in terms of negation and disjunction.

As one can verify, LP preserves most other inference patterns that one would expect to be valid, such as De Morgan&#x27;s laws and the usual introduction and elimination rules for negation, conjunction, and disjunction. Surprisingly, the logical truths (or tautologies) of LP are precisely those of classical propositional logic. (LP and classical logic differ only in the &quot;inferences&quot; they deem valid.) Relaxing the requirement that every formula be either true or false yields the weaker paraconsistent logic commonly known as first-degree entailment (FDE). Unlike LP, FDE contains no logical truths.

LP is only one of &quot;many&quot; paraconsistent logics that have been proposed. It is presented here merely as an illustration of how a paraconsistent logic can work.

== Relation to other logics ==
One important type of paraconsistent logic is relevance logic. A logic is &quot;relevant&quot; if it satisfies the following condition:

: if &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; is a theorem, then &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; share a non-logical constant.

It follows that a relevance logic cannot have (&quot;p&quot; ∧ ¬&quot;p&quot;) → &quot;q&quot; as a theorem, and thus (on reasonable assumptions) cannot validate the inference from {&quot;p&quot;, ¬&quot;p&quot;} to &quot;q&quot;.

Paraconsistent logic has significant overlap with many-valued logic; however, not all paraconsistent logics are many-valued (and, of course, not all many-valued logics are paraconsistent). Dialetheic logics, which are also many-valued, are paraconsistent, but the converse does not hold. The ideal 3-valued paraconsistent logic given below becomes the logic RM3 when the contrapositive is added.

Intuitionistic logic allows &quot;A&quot; ∨ ¬&quot;A&quot; not to be equivalent to true, while paraconsistent logic allows &quot;A&quot; ∧ ¬&quot;A&quot; not to be equivalent to false. Thus it seems natural to regard paraconsistent logic as the &quot;dual&quot; of intuitionistic logic. However, intuitionistic logic is a specific logical system whereas paraconsistent logic encompasses a large class of systems. Accordingly, the dual notion to paraconsistency is called &quot;paracompleteness&quot;, and the &quot;dual&quot; of intuitionistic logic (a specific paracomplete logic) is a specific paraconsistent system called &quot;anti-intuitionistic&quot; or &quot;dual-intuitionistic logic&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;Brazilian logic&quot;, for historical reasons). The duality between the two systems is best seen within a sequent calculus framework. While in intuitionistic logic the sequent

: formula_18

is not derivable, in dual-intuitionistic logic

: formula_19

is not derivable. Similarly, in intuitionistic logic the sequent

: formula_1

is not derivable, while in dual-intuitionistic logic

: formula_21

is not derivable. Dual-intuitionistic logic contains a connective # known as &quot;pseudo-difference&quot; which is the dual of intuitionistic implication. Very loosely, can be read as &quot;&quot;A&quot; but not &quot;B&quot;. However, # is not truth-functional as one might expect a &#x27;but not&#x27; operator to be; similarly, the intuitionistic implication operator cannot be treated like &quot;. Dual-intuitionistic logic also features a basic connective ⊤ which is the dual of intuitionistic ⊥: negation may be defined as 

A full account of the duality between paraconsistent and intuitionistic logic, including an explanation on why dual-intuitionistic and paraconsistent logics do not coincide, can be found in Brunner and Carnielli (2005).

These other logics avoid explosion: implicational propositional calculus, positive propositional calculus, equivalential calculus and minimal logic. The latter, minimal logic, is both paraconsistent and paracomplete (a subsystem of intuitionistic logic). The other three simply do not allow one to express a contradiction to begin with since they lack the ability to form negations.

== An ideal three-valued paraconsistent logic ==
Here is an example of a three-valued logic which is paraconsistent and &quot;ideal&quot; as defined in &quot;Ideal Paraconsistent Logics&quot; by O. Arieli, A. Avron, and A. Zamansky, especially pages 22–23. The three truth-values are: &quot;t&quot; (true only), &quot;b&quot; (both true and false), and &quot;f&quot; (false only).

A formula is true if its truth-value is either &quot;t&quot; or &quot;b&quot; for the valuation being used. A formula is a tautology of paraconsistent logic if it is true in every valuation which maps atomic propositions to {&quot;t&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;f&quot;}. Every tautology of paraconsistent logic is also a tautology of classical logic. For a valuation, the set of true formulas is closed under modus ponens and the deduction theorem. Any tautology of classical logic which contains no negations is also a tautology of paraconsistent logic (by merging &quot;b&quot; into &quot;t&quot;). This logic is sometimes referred to as &quot;Pac&quot; or &quot;LFI1&quot;.

:formula_49

=== Excluded ===
Some tautologies of classical logic which are &quot;not&quot; tautologies of paraconsistent logic are:
:formula_50 ** no explosion in paraconsistent logic
:formula_51
:formula_52
:formula_53 ** disjunctive syllogism fails in paraconsistent logic

=== Strategy ===
Suppose we are faced with a contradictory set of premises Γ and wish to avoid being reduced to triviality. In classical logic, the only method one can use is to reject one or more of the premises in Γ. In paraconsistent logic, we may try to compartmentalize the contradiction. That is, weaken the logic so that Γ→&quot;X&quot; is no longer a tautology provided the propositional variable &quot;X&quot; does not appear in Γ. However, we do not want to weaken the logic any more than is necessary for that purpose. So we wish to retain modus ponens and the deduction theorem as well as the axioms which are the introduction and elimination rules for the logical connectives (where possible).

To this end, we add a third truth-value &quot;b&quot; which will be employed within the compartment containing the contradiction. We make &quot;b&quot; a fixed point of all the logical connectives.
:formula_61

We must make &quot;b&quot; a kind of truth (in addition to &quot;t&quot;) because otherwise there would be no tautologies at all.

To ensure that modus ponens works, we must have
:formula_62
that is, to ensure that a true hypothesis and a true implication lead to a true conclusion, we must have that a not-true (&quot;f&quot;) conclusion and a true (&quot;t&quot; or &quot;b&quot;) hypothesis yield a not-true implication.

If all the propositional variables in Γ are assigned the value &quot;b&quot;, then Γ itself will have the value &quot;b&quot;. If we give &quot;X&quot; the value &quot;f&quot;, then
:formula_63.
So Γ→&quot;X&quot; will not be a tautology.

Limitations:
(1) There must not be constants for the truth values because that would defeat the purpose of paraconsistent logic. Having &quot;b&quot; would change the language from that of classical logic. Having &quot;t&quot; or &quot;f&quot; would allow the explosion again because
:formula_64 or formula_65
would be tautologies. Note that &quot;b&quot; is not a fixed point of those constants since &quot;b&quot; ≠ &quot;t&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ≠ &quot;f&quot;.

(2) This logic&#x27;s ability to contain contradictions applies only to contradictions among particularized premises, not to contradictions among axiom schemas.

(3) The loss of disjunctive syllogism may result in insufficient commitment to developing the &#x27;correct&#x27; alternative, possibly crippling mathematics.

(4) To establish that a formula Γ is equivalent to Δ in the sense that either can be substituted for the other wherever they appear as a subformula, one must show
:formula_66.
This is more difficult than in classical logic because the contrapositives do not necessarily follow.

== Applications ==
Paraconsistent logic has been applied as a means of managing inconsistency in numerous domains, including:
* Semantics: Paraconsistent logic has been proposed as means of providing a simple and intuitive formal account of truth that does not fall prey to paradoxes such as the Liar. However, such systems must also avoid Curry&#x27;s paradox, which is much more difficult as it does not essentially involve negation.
* Set theory and the foundations of mathematics
* Epistemology and belief revision: Paraconsistent logic has been proposed as a means of reasoning with and revising inconsistent theories and belief systems.
* Knowledge management and artificial intelligence: Some computer scientists have utilized paraconsistent logic as a means of coping gracefully with inconsistent or contradictory information. Mathematical framework and rules of paraconsistent logic have been proposed as the activation function of an artificial neuron in order to build a neural network for function approximation, model identification, and control with success.
* Deontic logic and metaethics: Paraconsistent logic has been proposed as a means of dealing with ethical and other normative conflicts.
* Software engineering: Paraconsistent logic has been proposed as a means for dealing with the pervasive inconsistencies among the documentation, use cases, and code of large software systems.
* Expert system. The Para-analyzer algorithm based on paraconsistent annotated logic by 2-value annotations (PAL2v), also called paraconsistent annotated evidential logic (PAL &quot;E&quot;t), derived from paraconsistent logic, has been used in decision-making systems, such as to support medical diagnosis.
* Electronics design routinely uses a four-valued logic, with &quot;hi-impedance (z)&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t care (x)&quot; playing similar roles to &quot;don&#x27;t know&quot; and &quot;both true and false&quot; respectively, in addition to true and false. This logic was developed independently of philosophical logics.
* Control system: A model reference control built with recurrent paraconsistent neural network for a rotary inverted pendulum presented better robustness and lower control effort compared to a classical well tuned pole placement controller.
*Digital filter: PAL2v Filter Algorithm, using a paraconsistent artificial neural cell of learning by contradiction extraction (PANLctx) in the composition of a paraconsistent analysis network (PANnet), based on the PAL2V rules and equations, can be used as an estimator, average extractor, filtering and in signal treatment for industrial automation and robotics.
*Contradiction Extractor. A recurrent algorithm based on the PAL2v rules and equations has been used to extract contradictions in a set of statistical data.
* Quantum physics
* Black hole physics
* Hawking radiation
* Quantum computing
* Spintronics
* Quantum entanglement
* Quantum coupling
* Uncertainty principle

== Criticism ==
Logic, as it is classically understood, rests on three main rules (Laws of Thought): The Law of Identity (&quot;LOI&quot;), the Law of Non-Contradiction (&quot;LNC&quot;), and the Law of the Excluded Middle (&quot;LEM&quot;). Paraconsistent logic deviates from classical logic by refusing to accept &quot;LNC&quot;. However, the &quot;LNC&quot; can be seen as closely interconnected with the &quot;LOI&quot; as well as the &quot;LEM&quot;:

   &quot;LoI&quot; states that &quot;A&quot; is &quot;A&quot; (&quot;A&quot;≡&quot;A&quot;). This means that &quot;A&quot; is distinct from its opposite or negation (&quot;not A&quot;, or ¬&quot;A&quot;). In classical logic this distinction is supported by the fact that when &quot;A&quot; is true, its opposite is not. However, without the &quot;LNC&quot;, both &quot;A&quot; and &quot;not A&quot; can be true (&quot;A&quot;∧¬&quot;A&quot;), which blurs their distinction. And without distinction, it becomes challenging to define identity. Dropping the &quot;LNC&quot; thus runs risk to also eliminate the &quot;LoI&quot;.

   &quot;LEM&quot; states that either &quot;A&quot; or &quot;not A&quot; are true (&quot;A&quot;∨¬&quot;A&quot;). However, without the &quot;LNC&quot;, both &quot;A&quot; and &quot;not A&quot; can be true (&quot;A&quot;∧¬&quot;A&quot;). Dropping the &quot;LNC&quot; thus runs risk to also eliminate the &quot;LEM&quot;

Hence, dropping the &quot;LNC&quot; in a careless manner risks losing both the &quot;LOI&quot; and &quot;LEM&quot; as well. And dropping &quot;all&quot; three classical laws does not just change the &quot;kind&quot; of logic—it leaves us without any functional system of logic altogether. Loss of &quot;all&quot; logic eliminates the possibility of structured reasoning, A careless paraconsistent logic therefore might run risk of disapproving of any means of thinking other than chaos. Paraconsistent logic aims to evade this danger using careful and precise technical definitions. As a consequence, most criticism of paraconsistent logic also tends to be highly technical in nature (e.g. surrounding questions such as whether a paradox can be true). 

However, even on a highly technical level, paraconsistent logic can be challenging to argue against. It is obvious that paraconsistent logic leads to contradictions. However, the paraconsistent logician embraces contradictions, including any contradictions that are a part or the result of paraconsistent logic. As a consequence, much of the critique has focused on the applicability and comparative effectiveness of paraconsistent logic. This is an important debate since embracing paraconsistent logic comes at the risk of losing a large amount of theorems that form the basis of mathematics and physics.

Logician Stewart Shapiro aimed to make a case for paraconsistent logic as part of his argument for a pluralistic view of logic (the view that different logics are equally appropriate, or equally correct). He found that a case could be made that either, intuitonistic logic as the &quot;One True Logic&quot;, or a pluralism of intuitonistic logic and classical logic is interesting and fruitful. However, when it comes to paraconsistent logic, he found &quot;no examples that are ... compelling (at least to me)&quot;.

In &quot;Saving Truth from Paradox&quot;, Hartry Field examines the value of paraconsistent logic as a solution to paradoxa. Field argues for a view that avoids both truth gluts (where a statement can be both true and false) and truth gaps (where a statement is neither true nor false). One of Field&#x27;s concerns is the problem of a paraconsistent metatheory: If the logic itself allows contradictions to be true, then the metatheory that describes or governs the logic might also have to be paraconsistent. If the metatheory is paraconsistent, then the justification of the logic (why we should accept it) might be suspect, because any argument made within a paraconsistent framework could potentially be both valid and invalid. This creates a challenge for proponents of paraconsistent logic to explain how their logic can be justified without falling into paradox or losing explanatory power. Stewart Shapiro expressed similar concerns: &quot;there are certain notions and concepts that the dialetheist invokes (informally), but which she cannot adequately express, unless the meta-theory is (completely) consistent. The insistence on a consistent meta-theory would undermine the key aspect of dialetheism&quot;

In his book &quot;In Contradiction&quot;, which argues in favor of paraconsistent dialetheism, Graham Priest admits to metatheoretic difficulties: &quot;Is there a metatheory for paraconsistent logics that is acceptable in paraconsistent terms? The answer to this question is not at all obvious.&quot;

Littmann and Keith Simmons argued that dialetheist theory is unintelligible: &quot;Once we realize that the theory includes not only the statement &#x27;(L) is both true and false&#x27; but also the statement &#x27;(L) isn&#x27;t both true and false&#x27; we may feel at a loss.&quot; 

Some philosophers have argued against dialetheism on the grounds that the counterintuitiveness of giving up any of the three principles above outweighs any counterintuitiveness that the principle of explosion might have.

Others, such as David Lewis, have objected to paraconsistent logic on the ground that it is simply impossible for a statement and its negation to be jointly true. A related objection is that &quot;negation&quot; in paraconsistent logic is not really &quot;negation&quot;; it is merely a subcontrary-forming operator.

== Alternatives ==
Approaches exist that allow for resolution of inconsistent beliefs without violating any of the intuitive logical principles. Most such systems use multi-valued logic with Bayesian inference and the Dempster-Shafer theory, allowing that no non-tautological belief is completely (100%) irrefutable because it must be based upon incomplete, abstracted, interpreted, likely unconfirmed, potentially uninformed, and possibly incorrect knowledge (of course, this very assumption, if non-tautological, entails its own refutability, if by &quot;refutable&quot; we mean &quot;not completely [100%] irrefutable&quot;).

<doc id="421086" wikidata="Q1000116" url="?curid=421086" title="Axiom of countable choice">
<text>The axiom of countable choice or axiom of denumerable choice, denoted ACω, is an axiom of set theory that states that every countable collection of non-empty sets must have a choice function. That is, given a function formula_1 with domain formula_2 (where formula_2 denotes the set of natural numbers) such that formula_4 is a non-empty set for every formula_5, there exists a function formula_6 with domain formula_2 such that formula_8 for every formula_5.

==Applications==
ACω is particularly useful for the development of mathematical analysis, where many results depend on having a choice function for a countable collection of sets of real numbers. For instance, in order to prove that every accumulation point formula_10 of a set formula_11 is the limit of some sequence of elements of formula_12, one needs (a weak form of) the axiom of countable choice. When formulated for accumulation points of arbitrary metric spaces, the statement becomes equivalent to ACω.

The ability to perform analysis using countable choice has led to the inclusion of ACω as an axiom in some forms of constructive mathematics, despite its assertion that a choice function exists without constructing it.

===Example: infinite implies Dedekind-infinite===
As an example of an application of ACω, here is a proof (from ZF + ACω) that every infinite set is Dedekind-infinite:

Let formula_13 be infinite. For each natural number formula_14, let formula_15 be the set of all formula_14-tuples of distinct elements of formula_13. Since formula_13 is infinite, each formula_15 is non-empty. Application of ACω yields a sequence formula_20 where each formula_21 is an formula_14-tuple. One can then concatenate these tuples into a single sequence formula_23 of elements of formula_13, possibly with repeating elements. Suppressing repetitions produces a sequence formula_25 of distinct elements, where

This formula_26 exists, because when selecting formula_27 it is not possible for all elements of formula_28 to be among the formula_14 elements selected previously. So formula_13 contains a countable set. The function that maps each formula_27 to formula_32 (and leaves all other elements of formula_13 fixed) is a one-to-one map from formula_13 into formula_13 which is not onto, proving that formula_13 is Dedekind-infinite.

==Relation to other axioms==
===Stronger and independent systems===
The axiom of countable choice (ACω) is strictly weaker than the axiom of dependent choice (DC), which in turn is weaker than the axiom of choice (AC). DC, and therefore also ACω, hold in the Solovay model, constructed in 1970 by Robert M. Solovay as a model of set theory without the full axiom of choice, in which all sets of real numbers are measurable.

Urysohn&#x27;s lemma (UL) and the Tietze extension theorem (TET) are independent of ZF+ACω: there exist models of ZF+ACω in which UL and TET are true, and models in which they are false. Both UL and TET are implied by DC.

===Weaker systems===
Paul Cohen showed that ACω is not provable in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) without the axiom of choice. However, some countably infinite sets of non-empty sets can be proven to have a choice function in ZF without &quot;any&quot; form of the axiom of choice. For example, formula_37 has a choice function, where formula_38 is the set of hereditarily finite sets, i.e. the first set in the Von Neumann universe of non-finite rank. The choice function is (trivially) the least element in the well-ordering. Another example is the set of proper and bounded open intervals of real numbers with rational endpoints.

ZF+ACω suffices to prove that the union of countably many countable sets is countable. These statements are not equivalent: &quot;Cohen&#x27;s First Model&quot; supplies an example where countable unions of countable sets are countable, but where ACω does not hold.

===Equivalent forms===
There are many equivalent forms to the axiom of countable choice, in the sense that any one of them can be proven in ZF assuming any other of them. They include the following:
*Every countable collection of non-empty sets has a choice function.
*Every infinite collection of non-empty sets has an infinite sub-collection with a choice function.
*Every σ-compact space (the union of countably many compact spaces) is a Lindelöf space (every open cover has a countable subcover). A metric space is σ-compact if and only if it is Lindelöf.
*Every second-countable space (it has a countable base of open sets) is a separable space (it has a countable dense subset). A metric space is separable if and only if it is σ-compact.
*Every sequentially continuous real-valued function in a metric space is a continuous function.
*Every accumulation point of a subset of a metric space is a limit of a sequence of points from the subset.
*The Rasiowa–Sikorski lemma MAformula_39, a countable form of Martin&#x27;s axiom: in a preorder with the countable chain condition, every countable family of dense subsets has a filter intersecting all the subsets. (In this context, a set is called dense if every element of the preorder has a lower bound in the set.)

<text>Darwin Project is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle royale game developed and published by Scavengers Studio. It was released on January 14, 2020 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.

==Plot==
&quot;Darwin Project&quot; takes place in a dystopian post-apocalyptic landscape in the Northern Canadian Rockies. As preparation for an impending ice age, a new project- half science experiment, half live-entertainment- is launched. Players are dropped into an arena, initially armed with only an axe and a bow, and have to gather resources and survive along with 9 others. Players must craft items such as campfires and arrows and upgrade their weapons (axe and bow) using resources in order to survive and fight until only one player remains, winning the game.

== Gameplay ==
Ten prisoners are spawned into a snowy arena made up of seven tiles, each including different environments from tree houses to lava-filled zones and more. The game is run by the eleventh player, The Show Director, who is equipped with powers to make the game more interesting for the ten prisoners fighting for their lives. Each player can choose to play as a male or female prisoner. They are equipped with an axe, a bow and arrows. They can also choose three pieces of equipment from among bear traps, cage traps, snowballs, hooks, gliders, and tripwires. Players can use electronics that can be granted by the show director, or rewarded by getting the first kill of the game. The electronics are used to make powers for the prisoners to give them advantages in fighting or fleeing. Players can choose how to play throughout the arena by choosing different variations of builds. Builds include arrow type, the equipment used, electronic powers equipped (three per player), axe type, a cloak, and boots, all of which will also change the play style of each prisoner.

==Development==
The development team behind &quot;Darwin Project&quot; has 18 members. The game was revealed at PAX East 2017 and officially announced at Microsoft&#x27;s E3 2017 press conference. Multiple alpha and beta tests have occurred on PC.

On 24 April 2018, the game was made into an early access free-to-play title.

On 14 January 2020, the game was released on Steam, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

On 13 May 2020, Scavengers Studio announced that they would stop any further development on the game, while keeping servers opened at least up to the end of 2020.

On 20 November 2020, the studio announced that the servers in two regions (EU-Central and US-East) would stay open. Players from around the world can still play the game in these two regions.

== Reception ==

&quot;Darwin Project&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.

<doc id="421089" wikidata="Q445643" url="?curid=421089" title="Lee Byung-chul">
<text>Lee Byung-chul (; 12 February 1910 – 19 November 1987) was a South Korean businessman who founded the Samsung Group, the country&#x27;s largest chaebol (conglomerate). Lee founded Samsung in 1938, at the age of 28. He is recognized as the most successful business magnate in South Korea&#x27;s history.

==Early life and education==
Lee was born on 12 February 1910 in Uiryeong County, South Gyeongsang Province, then part of the Korean Empire. He was born the youngest son of four siblings to father Lee Chan-woo and mother Kwon Jae-lim. He was the son of a wealthy land-owning yangban family, a branch of the Gyeongju Lee clan.

He attended high school at Joongdong High School in Seoul, and in 1929, he enrolled in the Department of Political Economy at Waseda University in Tokyo but didn&#x27;t finish his studies and decided to drop out in 1931.

In 1982, Lee was awarded an honorary doctorate from Boston College.

==Career==

=== Samsung ===
Lee established a trucking business and real estate business in Daegu on 1 March 1938, which he named Samsung Trading Co, the forerunner to Samsung. Samsung means () which explains the initial corporate logos.

By 1945, Samsung was transporting goods throughout Korea and to other countries. The company was based in Seoul by 1947.

=== Korean War ===
Samsung was one of the ten largest &quot;trading companies&quot; when the Korean War started in 1950.

With the conquest of Seoul by the North Korean army, Lee was forced to relocate his business to Busan. The massive influx of U.S. troops and equipment into Busan over the next year and a half of the war proved to be highly beneficial to Lee&#x27;s trading company.

=== Federation of Korean Industries ===
In 1961, when Park Chung Hee seized power in the May 16 coup, Lee was in Japan and for some time he did not return to South Korea. Eventually, a deal was struck and Lee returned but Samsung had to give up control over the banks it acquired and follow economic directives from Park&#x27;s government.

The first step of the Federation of Korean Industries was established in August 1961. The association was founded by Samsung Group chairman Lee Byung-chul.

Later in life, Lee served as chairman of the Federation of Korean Industries and was known as the richest man in Korea.

=== Cultural and art ===
In 1965, he established the Samsung Culture Foundation to promote a broad range of programs to enrich Korean cultural life.

=== Samsung Electronics ===
In 1969, Samsung Electronics Manufacturing (renamed Samsung Electronics) and later merged with Samsung-Sanyo Electric. Samsung Electronics Manufacturing had 45 employees and about sales in 1970 and it made household electronics exclusively.

== Personal life ==
=== Death ===
After his death, Ho-Am Art Museum was opened to the public for tours. His collection of Korean art is considered one of the largest private collections in the country, featuring a number of art objects that have been designated &quot;National Treasures&quot; by the Korean government. Ho-Am is located a short distance from the Everland park, one of South Korea&#x27;s popular amusement parks (Everland is also owned by the Samsung Group).

<text>Deep image is a term coined by U.S. poets Jerome Rothenberg and Robert Kelly in the second issue of the magazine &quot;Trobar&quot; in 1961. They used the term to describe poetry written by Diane Wakoski, Clayton Eshleman, and themselves.

In creating the term, Rothenberg was inspired by the Spanish &quot;cante jondo&quot; (&quot;deep song&quot;), especially the work of Federico García Lorca and by the symbolist theory of correspondences.

In general, deep image poems are resonant, stylized and heroic in tone. Longer poems tend to be catalogues of free-standing images.

The deep image group was short-lived in the manner that Kelly and Rothenberg defined.

It was later redeveloped by Robert Bly and used by many, such as Galway Kinnell and James Wright. The redevelopment relied on being concrete, not abstract, and to let the images make the experience and to let the images and experience generate the meanings. This new style of Deep Image tended to be narrative, but was often lyrical.

<text>The Horse and His Boy is a high fantasy novel written by British author C. S. Lewis and published by Geoffrey Bles in 1954. Of the seven novels that comprise &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; (1950–1956), &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; was the fifth to be published. The novel is set in the period covered by the last chapter of &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot; during the reign of the four Pevensie children as . Though three of the Pevensies appear as minor characters in &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, the main characters are two children and two talking horses who escape from Calormen and travel north into Narnia. On their journey, they learn of the Prince of Calormen&#x27;s plan to attack Archenland, and warn the King of Archenland of the impending strike.

Like the other novels in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; was illustrated by Pauline Baynes; her work has been retained in many later editions.

==Plot summary==
Shasta is a boy who lives in southern Calormen with Arsheesh, an abusive fisherman, whom Shasta believes to be his father. A powerful nobleman demands hospitality one evening, and haggles with Arsheesh to buy Shasta as his slave. It emerges that Arsheesh is not Shasta&#x27;s father, having found him in a washed-up boat as a baby. In the stable, Bree, the nobleman&#x27;s stallion, astounds the boy by speaking. He tells Shasta that the nobleman is very cruel to his slaves, and suggests they both flee to his homeland of Narnia, from where he was captured as a foal. Shasta agrees, and they sneak away at night.

After weeks of northwards travel, during which the two companions bond, a brief chase to escape lions leads to their meeting another pair of refugees: another Narnian Talking Horse, the mare Hwin, who like Bree desires to return home, and Aravis, a young noblewoman who wants to escape a political marriage to Ahoshta, the ugly Grand Vizier. Although Shasta and Aravis immediately dislike each other, the four decide to travel together. In Tashbaan, the capital of Calormen, a party of Narnians mistake Shasta for Corin, the prince of Archenland, a Narnian ally, who has gone missing. Taken from the others, Shasta overhears the Narnians planning to escape Calormen to prevent a forced marriage between Queen Susan and Rabadash, son of the Tisroc, the Calormen ruler. Shasta escapes when Corin returns, but not before learning of a hidden route through the desert.

Meanwhile, Aravis is spotted by her friend Lasaraleen, who helps Aravis escape through the Tisroc&#x27;s garden, although she cannot understand Aravis&#x27; motives. On the way, they overhear the Tisroc discussing the Narnians&#x27; escape with Rabadash and Ahoshta. The Tisroc gives Rabadash permission to raid Archenland and Narnia to kidnap Queen Susan while High King Peter is away battling giants in the north, but notes that he cannot openly support such a raid and will renounce Rabadash if he fails. The four fugitives reunite at a necropolis where Shasta has had supernatural dreams. Pooling their information, they set out across the desert along the hidden route to warn Archenland; they are again chased by a lion, which injures Aravis. 

A hermit tends to Aravis&#x27; wounds, while Shasta carries on, on foot. He finds Lune, King of Archenland, and warns him of the raiders. He is separated from Lune in thick fog and encounters an unseen presence, who claims to have been not only the lion who injured Aravis, but also the lion who caused the four to join forces, and even the one who guided Shasta&#x27;s boat to Arsheesh. The presence disappears, and Shasta finds himself in Narnia. He again meets Corin, who is travelling southwards with the Narnian party (who escaped from Calormen successfully) to assist Archenland. The Narnians, led by King Edmund and Queen Lucy, arrive at the Archenland capital of Anvard, and defeat the Calormenes, who were unable to take the castle because of Shasta&#x27;s warning. Rabadash is captured and most of his men are killed, including Bree&#x27;s old master. In the aftermath, Aslan appears and turns Rabadash into a donkey after he refuses to accept defeat. His human form is restored when he returns to Tashbaan, but thereafter he is forbidden to travel more than ten miles from the city, on pain of permanent transformation. His reign as Tisroc is therefore very peaceful despite earning the nickname &quot;Rabadash the Ridiculous.&quot;

Lune realizes that Shasta is his son Cor, the long-lost identical twin of Prince Corin and the heir to the Archenland throne. Cor had been kidnapped as a baby in an attempt to thwart a prophecy which foretold that he would save Archenland from its greatest peril. He was lost at sea in the ensuing battle to rescue him, but Aslan made sure that the baby found his way to Arsheesh. Shasta&#x27;s warning fulfilled the prophecy. Corin is delighted that Shasta is heir, as he did not want to be king. Aravis and Cor eventually marry and rule Archenland after Lune&#x27;s death. Their son, Ram, becomes the most famous king of Archenland. Bree and Hwin found love separately after returning to Narnia and all four would reunite regularly.

==Themes and motifs==
===Divine providence===
After meeting King Lune of Archenland and warning him of the impending Calormene invasion, Shasta becomes lost in a fog and separated from the Archenlanders. While walking in the fog, he senses a mysterious presence nearby. Engaging in conversation with the unknown being, Shasta tells of his misfortunes, including twice being chased by lions. His companion, who turns out to be Aslan, responds as follows:
The incidents which Shasta perceived as misfortunes were orchestrated by Aslan, in his Divine Providence, for greater purposes.

===&quot;Narnia and the North!&quot;===
Bree and Shasta use the phrase &quot;Narnia and the North&quot; as their &quot;rallying cry&quot; as they make their escape from their life in Calormen. They are both motivated by a deep longing to find their way to their true homeland. In the setting of &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, the reader finds a departure from the landscapes, culture, and people of the Narnian realms which have become familiar in the other books. The placement of the action in the realm of Calormen helps to convey a sense of &quot;unbelonging&quot; on the part of the characters and the reader, which reinforces the motif of longing for a true home.

==Allusions and references==

The association of Cor with horses, and his twin brother Corin with boxing, recalls the traditional associations of the Spartan twins Castor and Pollux of Greek mythology.

Researcher Ruth North has noted that the plot element of a sinful human being transformed into a donkey as a punishment and then restored to humanity as an act of Divine mercy is reminiscent of &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; by Apuleius, a classic of Latin literature.

==Adaptations==
BBC Radio 4 dramatised &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, including &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, in 1998. The dramatisation is entitled &quot;The Complete Chronicles of Narnia: The Classic BBC Radio 4 Full-Cast Dramatisations&quot;.

Focus on the Family produced an audio dramatisation of &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; in 2000.

Walden Media made movie adaptations of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; and &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;. Walden Media obtained an option to make &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Horse and His Boy&quot; in the future.

In 2022, The Logos Theater, of Taylors, South Carolina, created a stage adaptation of &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, with later performances at the Museum of the Bible and Ark Encounter.

<doc id="421108" wikidata="Q2918770" url="?curid=421108" title="Shoulder-fired missile">
<text>Shoulder-fired missile, shoulder-launched missile or man-portable missile, among other variants, are common slang terms to describe high-caliber shoulder-mounted weapons systems; that is, weapons firing large, heavy projectiles (&quot;missiles&quot;), typically using the backblast principle, which are small enough to be carried by a single person and fired while held on one&#x27;s shoulder. The word &quot;&quot; in this context is used in its original broad sense of a heavy projectile, and encompasses all shells and rockets, guided or unguided (compare with guided missile). A more formal variant is simply &quot;shoulder-fired weapons system&quot; and the like.

Shoulder-launched weapons may be guided or unguided, and the systems can either be disposable, such as the Panzerfaust 1, M72 LAW, AT4, etc., or reusable, such as the Panzerfaust 2, Carl Gustaf 8.4 cm recoilless rifle, RPG-7, etc. Some systems are classified as semi-disposable, such as the Panzerfaust 3.

== Slang nicknames ==
In many instances, the name &quot;bazooka&quot; is regularly used as an informal name for shoulder mounted &quot;tube-like&quot; launchers, stemming from the actual historical shoulder-fired missile-systems named such, the famous M1 Bazooka and M20 Super Bazooka man-portable rocket launchers of World War II.

The name &quot;rocket-propelled grenade&quot; (&quot;RPG&quot;) is regularly used as an informal name for man-portable unguided rocket-launcher systems, a backronym from the Russian acronym &quot;РПГ&quot; (Ручной Противотанковый Гранатомёт, &quot;Ruchnoy Protivotankovy Granatomyot&quot;), meaning &quot;handheld anti-tank grenade launcher&quot;, the Russian term for infantry-carried anti-tank weapons, not only encompassing rocket-systems (see the RPG-2 for example).

== Description ==
=== Types ===

There are many types of shoulder-launched missile-weapons. Some systems are reloadable or semi-reusable, while others are single-use disposable systems, much in the same manner as a hand grenade. Ammunition traditionally use the backblast principle for propulsion, meaning that when fired, the propellant gases are expelled out of the back of the weapon to alleviate the reactional force exerted from the projectile moving forward.

If the weapon fires ammunition using fixed propellant charges, such as through cartridge cases on reloadable systems or a fixed container on singe-use systems, it is generally called a man-portable or shoulder-launched/fired recoilless rifle or recoilless gun, depending on if it uses a rifled or smoothbore barrel, essentially open-breech cannons. Smoothbore systems generally fire fin-stabilised munitions.

If the weapon fires rocket-propelled or rocket-assisted projectiles (booster launched), it is generally called a man-portable or shoulder-launched/fired rocket launcher or missile-system, depending on, depending on whether the ammunition is unguided or guided. Such systems typically use a small recoilless charge (a so-called booster charge) or compressed gas system to get the projectile out of the barrel and to a distance where the operator will not be hurt by the rocket&#x27;s backblast; when the rocket ignites at a safe distance, it further accelerates the projectile or at least keeps it from decelerating in its trajectory.

=== Roles ===

Shoulder-launched weapons typically fire at one of two main target types—ground targets or air targets. Weapons for use against ground targets come in a wide variety of types and sizes, with smaller, unguided weapons generally used for close range combat and larger, guided systems for longer ranges. Most of these weapons are designed mainly for anti-tank warfare, as anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) and carry one or two (a tandem-charge) high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) shaped charge warheads. However, they are also effective against structures, and many such weapons have been designed specifically for such targets.

Anti-aircraft weapons, known as man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), are small surface-to-air missiles. They usually have infrared homing and are used against helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other low-flying fixed-wing aircraft.

== History ==
Rocket-based weapons have a long history, from the black powder fire arrows used by the ancient Chinese to the Congreve rocket referenced in &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner,&quot; the national anthem of the United States. They have always been prized for the portability of their launch systems.

The earliest rocket launchers documented in imperial China launched fire arrows with launchers constructed of wood, basketry, and bamboo tubes. The rocket launchers divided the fire arrows with frames meant to keep the arrows separated, and were capable of firing multiple arrow rockets at once. Textual evidence and illustrations of various early rocket launchers are found in the 11th-century Southern Song dynasty text &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot;. The &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot; describes a portable rocket arrow carrier consisting of a sling and a bamboo tube.

Shoulder-launched rockets have a launch tube. In order to prevent the user from being burned by the exhaust, the rocket (or at least its first stage) must burn out before it leaves the tube, and if present the second stage must fire once the rocket is well clear of the launcher. Even if the operator is safe, there is a sizeable blast effect to the rear.

Also, the rocket must have a reliable ignition system. In modern systems, this is almost always a percussion cap. This system was not fully developed until the German Panzerfaust of World War II, an early one-shot design that also was the first practical recoilless antitank gun and thus used no rocket. The bazooka was an early rocket-propelled development which could be reloaded.

=== Usage ===
From their first conception during the First World War, many portable missiles have been used to give infantry a weapon effective against armored vehicles and fortified structures. The power of the shaped charge meant that the effectiveness of the weapon was not limited by a gun barrel bore nor size of weapon as for example a conventional armor-piercing shell from an artillery piece. As such these man-portable weapons could be used to equip infantry units with their own anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons.

Shoulder-launched rockets or recoilless guns are a favored anti-technical weapon. They permit otherwise lightly or poorly armed troops (e.g. militias) to destroy modern sophisticated equipment such as close air-support aircraft, helicopters, and lightly armored vehicles.

Attacks come from ambush for the element of surprise and attempt to immobilize a convoy of vehicles, then destroy its defenders, then destroy its contents, then escape before air or artillery support can arrive.

Normally, the militia will plan to have two to four shooters per attacked vehicle. Reliable attack ranges are 50 to 100 m, although attacks can succeed out to 300 m. Self-destruct ranges of common rocket weapons such as RPG-7s are about 900 m.

The usual response to such attacks is to suppress the shooters, with saturation anti-personnel fire, artillery or aerial barrages in area-denial attacks. Submunition and thermobaric weapons are often used to clear landing zones (LZ) for helicopters.

In modern counter-insurgency operations in misty, dusty or night-time situations, advanced optics such as infrared telescopes permit helicopter gunships to observe convoys from beyond human-visible range and still attack insurgents with inexpensive anti-personnel fire. This approach is more economical than area-denial. Protecting as little as 20% of the convoys rapidly depletes an area of active insurgents.

<doc id="421109" wikidata="Q253328" url="?curid=421109" title="Evelyn Keyes">
<text>Evelyn Louise Keyes (November 20, 1916 – July 4, 2008) was an American film actress. She is best known for her role as Suellen O&#x27;Hara in the 1939 film &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

==Early life==
Evelyn Keyes was born in Port Arthur, Texas, to Omar Dow Keyes and Maude Ollive Keyes, the daughter of a Methodist minister. After Omar Keyes died when she was three years old, Keyes moved with her mother to Atlanta, Georgia, where they lived with her grandparents. According to her memoir, Keyes was sexually molested by one of her brother&#x27;s friends when she was five years old. As a teenager, Keyes took dancing lessons and performed for local clubs such as the Daughters of the Confederacy.

==Film career==

A chorus girl by age 18, Keyes came out to Hollywood and was introduced to Cecil B. DeMille who in her own words &quot;signed me to a personal contract without even making a test&quot;. After a handful of B movies at Paramount Pictures, she was cast in &quot;Say It in French&quot; (1938). However, Keyes had to drop out to have an abortion and was replaced by Olympe Bradna. Later, she auditioned for the role of Scarlett O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939). Though she failed to get the part, Selznick was impressed by her Southern accent and cast her as Scarlett O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s sister Suellen in January 1939.

Columbia Pictures signed her to a contract. In 1941, she played an ingenue in &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot;. She spent most of the early 1940s playing leads in many of Columbia&#x27;s B dramas and mysteries. She appeared as the female lead opposite Larry Parks in Columbia&#x27;s blockbuster hit &quot;The Jolson Story&quot; (1946). She followed this up with an enjoyable minor screwball comedy, &quot;The Mating of Millie&quot;, with Glenn Ford. She was then in a 1949 role as Kathy Flannigan in &quot;Mrs. Mike&quot;. Keyes&#x27; last role in a major film was a small part as Tom Ewell&#x27;s vacationing wife in &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot; (1955). Keyes officially retired in 1956, but continued to act.

==Personal life==
In her autobiography &quot;Scarlett O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s Younger Sister: My Lively Life In and Out of Hollywood,&quot; Keyes described being raped by her director Andrew Stone while working on &quot;Say It in French.&quot; Keyes became pregnant and got an abortion in late 1938, which got her fired from the picture, and replaced with Olympe Branda. Only weeks later, she was cast in &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;. She married Barton Bainbridge shortly after. Bainbridge was an alcoholic, and threatened Keyes with a gun on at least one occasion. They separated and in 1940, he committed suicide with a shotgun in her car, leaving a note. Keyes wrote: &quot;The note said it was because I had left him. I never left a man again. I made them leave me.&quot;

Later, she married and divorced director Charles Vidor (1943–1945), actor/director John Huston (23 July 1946 – February 1950), and bandleader Artie Shaw (1957–1985). Keyes said of her many love affairs: &quot;I always took up with the man of the moment and there were many such moments.&quot; While married to Huston, the couple adopted a twelve-year-old Mexican child, Pablo, whom Huston had discovered while filming on location in Mexico for &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;. In her memoir, Keyes claimed that her adoptive son sexually molested her and that they lost contact after only a few years.

Keyes expressed her opinion that &quot;Mrs. Mike&quot; was her best film. Among her many love affairs in Hollywood she recounted in &quot;Scarlett O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s Younger Sister&quot;, were those with film producer Michael Todd (who left Evelyn for Elizabeth Taylor), actors Glenn Ford, Sterling Hayden, Dick Powell, Anthony Quinn, David Niven and Kirk Douglas. She had to regularly fend off Columbia Pictures studio head Harry Cohn&#x27;s advances during her career at the studio.

Keyes died of uterine cancer on July 4, 2008 at the Pepper Estates in Montecito, California, and was cremated. Half her ashes were sent to Lamar University in Port Arthur, Texas and the rest were divided among relatives and buried in a family plot at Waco Baptist Church Cemetery, Waco, Georgia, with a small tombstone bearing the epitaph &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

<text>Keep Left was a pamphlet published in the United Kingdom in 1947 by the &quot;New Statesman&quot; jointly written by Michael Foot, Richard Crossman and Ian Mikardo. It advocated a democratic socialist &quot;third force&quot; foreign policy, a socialist Europe acting independently from either the United States or the Soviet Union, against the pro-American foreign policy of Labour foreign secretary Ernest Bevin. &quot;Keep Left&quot; was a key statement of the Labour left&#x27;s dissent from the 1945-51 Labour government.

<text>Norbert Elias (; 22 June 1897 – 1 August 1990) was a Jewish German sociologist who later became a British citizen. He is especially famous for his theory of civilizing/decivilizing processes.

==Life and career==
Elias was born on 22 June 1897 in Breslau (today: Wrocław) in Prussia&#x27;s Silesia Province to Hermann Elias (1860–1940) and Sophie Elias, née Gallewski (also Galewski, 1875–1942). His father was a native of Kempen (today: Kępno) and a businessman in the textile industry. His mother was a native of the Jewish community of Breslau itself.

After passing the abitur in 1915, Norbert Elias volunteered for the German army in World War I and was employed as a telegrapher, first at the Eastern front, then at the Western front. After suffering a nervous breakdown in 1917, he was declared unfit for service and was posted to Breslau as a medical orderly.

The same year, Elias began studying philosophy, psychology and medicine at the University of Breslau, in addition spending a term each at the universities of Heidelberg (where he attended lectures by Karl Jaspers) and Freiburg in 1919 and 1920. He quit medicine in 1919 after passing the preliminary examination &quot;(Physikum)&quot;. To finance his studies after his father&#x27;s fortune had been reduced by hyperinflation, he took up a job as the head of the export department in a local hardware factory 1922. In 1924, he graduated with a doctoral dissertation in philosophy entitled &quot;Idee und Individuum&quot; (&quot;Idea and Individual&quot;) supervised by Richard Hönigswald, a representative of neo-Kantianism. Disappointed about the absence of the social aspect from neo-Kantianism, which had led to a serious dispute with his supervisor about his dissertation, Elias decided to turn to sociology for his further studies.

During his Breslau years, until 1925, Elias was deeply involved in the German Zionist movement, and acted as one of the leading intellectuals within the German-Jewish youth movement &quot;Blau-Weiss&quot; (Blue-White). During these years he got acquainted with other young Zionists like Erich Fromm, Leo Strauss, Leo Löwenthal and Gershom Scholem. In 1925, Elias moved to Heidelberg, where Alfred Weber accepted him as a candidate for a habilitation (second book project) on the development of modern science, entitled &quot;Die Bedeutung der Florentiner Gesellschaft und Kultur für die Entstehung der Wissenschaft&quot; (&quot;The Significance of Florentine Society and Culture for the Development of Science&quot;). In 1930 Elias chose to cancel this project and followed Karl Mannheim to become his assistant at the University of Frankfurt. However, after the Nazi take-over in early 1933, Mannheim&#x27;s sociological institute was forced to close. The already submitted habilitation thesis entitled &quot;Der höfische Mensch&quot; (&quot;The Man of the Court&quot;) was never formally accepted and not published until 1969 in a much elaborated form as &quot;Die höfische Gesellschaft&quot; (&quot;The Court Society&quot;).

In 1933, Elias fled to Paris. His elderly parents remained in Breslau, where his father died in 1940; on 30 August 1942 his mother was deported to Theresienstadt, and on 29 September transferred to and murdered in Treblinka. During his two years in Paris, Elias worked as a private scholar supported by a scholarship from the &quot;Amsterdam Steunfonds&quot; (Prof. Frijda&#x27;s benefit fund) and tried to gain some additional income by organizing a workshop for the production of wooden children&#x27;s toys. In 1935, he moved on to Great Britain, where he worked on his magnum opus, &quot;The Civilizing Process&quot;, until 1939, now supported by a scholarship from a relief organization for Jewish refugees. In this work, he described the Nazi&#x27;s genocide of the Jews as a &quot;decivilizing spurt&quot; of a civilization suffering from decay and a regression to barbarism. This work also contain&#x27;s Elias&#x27; body theory. Drawing from historical documents describing manners and etiquette, he identified the processes that facilitated the emergence of the modern self within a civilized body. Elias equated the term &quot;civilized&quot; with the &quot;controlled&quot; body. In 1939, he met up with his former friend and supervisor Mannheim at the London School of Economics, where he obtained a position as senior research assistant. In 1940, the LSE was evacuated to Cambridge, but when an invasion of Britain by German forces appeared imminent, Elias was detained at internment camps in Liverpool and on the Isle of Man for eight months, on account of his being German – an &quot;enemy alien&quot;. During his internment he organized political lectures and staged a drama he had written himself, &quot;Die Ballade vom armen Jakob&quot; (&quot;The Ballad of Poor Jacob&quot;) with a musical score by Hans Gál (eventually published in 1987).

Upon his release in 1941, he returned to Cambridge. Towards the end of the war, he worked for British intelligence, investigating hardened Nazis among German prisoners of war (see his essay &quot;The breakdown of civilisation&quot;, in &quot;Studies on the Germans&quot;). He taught evening classes for the Workers&#x27; Educational Association (the adult education organization), and later evening extension courses in sociology, psychology, economics and economic history at the University of Leicester. He also held occasional lectureships at other institutions of higher learning. In collaboration with a friend from Frankfurt days, the psychoanalyst S. H. Foulkes, he laid the theoretical foundations of Group Analysis, an important school of therapy, and co-founded the Group Analytic Society in 1952. He himself trained and worked as a group therapist. On Febr. 22, 1952 he was naturalized as a British citizen.

In 1954 – at the very late age of 57 – he at last gained his first secure academic post, at University College Leicester (which soon became the University of Leicester), first as lecturer and later as reader in sociology. Along with his friend Ilya Neustadt, he made a major contribution to the development of the university&#x27;s department of sociology, which became one of the largest and most influential departments in the United Kingdom. He retired in 1962, but continued to teach graduate students in Leicester until the mid-1970s. Among subsequently famous sociologists whom Neustadt and Elias appointed as colleagues at Leicester, were John H. Goldthorpe, Anthony Giddens, Martin Albrow, Sheila Allen, Joe and Olive Banks, Richard Brown, Mary McIntosh, Nicos Mouzelis and Sami Zubaida and Keith Hopkins. (Hopkins was subsequently Professor of Ancient History at Cambridge: his appointment to teach sociology in Leicester is one sign of the very broad conception Elias and Neustadt had of the discipline of sociology.) Students in the department included John Eldridge, Chris Bryant, Chris Rojek, Paul Hirst, Graeme Salaman and Bryan Wilson. From 1962 to 1964, Elias taught as professor of sociology at the University of Ghana in Legon near Accra. After his return to Europe in 1965, he spent much time as visiting professor in various German and Dutch universities, and from 1978 based himself in Amsterdam.
His reputation and popularity grew immensely after the republication of &quot;The Civilizing Process&quot; in 1969. From 1978 to 1984 he worked at the Center for Interdisciplinary Research at the University of Bielefeld from which he received an honorary doctorate in 1980. Elias was the first ever laureate of both the Theodor W. Adorno Prize (1977) and the European Amalfi Prize for Sociology and Social Sciences (1987). In 1986 the &quot;Große Verdienstkreuz&quot; of the German Federal Republic was awarded to him, and on his 90th birthday he was appointed Commander in the Order of Orange-Nassau by the Dutch queen. By 1998 an International Sociological Association worldwide survey of sociologists ranked &quot;On the Process of Civilization&quot; (revised later title) seventh among the most important books in sociology in the twentieth century. In 1990 he collected himself the Nonino prize for a &quot;Maestro del nostro tempo&quot; in Italy. Outside his sociological work he always also wrote poetry.

Elias died at his home in Amsterdam on 1 August 1990. In September 2017, a bridge in the Vondelpark, not too far from where he lived, was named after him. In Almere city a street in the &#x27;sustainable&#x27; sociologists&#x27; quarter also bears his name.

==Work==
Elias&#x27; theory focused on the relationship between power, behavior, emotion, and knowledge over time. He significantly shaped what is called process or figurational sociology. Due to historical circumstances, Elias had long remained a marginal author, until being rediscovered by a new generation of scholars in the 1970s, when he eventually became one of the most influential sociologists in the history of the field. Interest in his work can be partly attributed to the fact that his concept of large social figurations or networks of interdependencies between people explains the emergence and function of large societal structures without neglecting the aspect of individual agency. In the 1960s and 1970s, the overemphasis of structure over agency was heavily criticized about the then-dominant school of structural functionalism.

Elias&#x27; most famous work is &quot;Über den Prozess der Zivilisation&quot;, published in English as &quot;The Civilizing Process&quot; (or, more accurately in the Collected Works edition – see below – as &quot;On the Process of Civilisation&quot;). Originally published in German, in two volumes, in 1939, it was virtually ignored until its republication in 1969, when its first volume was also translated into English. The first volume traces the historical developments of the European &quot;habitus&quot;, or &quot;second nature,&quot; the particular individual psychic structures molded by social attitudes. Elias traced how post-medieval European standards regarding violence, sexual behaviour, bodily functions, table manners and forms of speech were gradually transformed by increasing thresholds of shame and repugnance, working outward from a nucleus in court etiquette. The internalized &quot;self-restraint&quot; imposed by increasingly complex networks of social connections developed the &quot;psychological&quot; self-perceptions that Freud recognized as the &quot;super-ego.&quot; The second volume of &quot;The Civilizing Process&quot; looks into the causes of these processes and finds them in the increasingly centralized Early Modern state and the increasingly differentiated and interconnected web of society.

When Elias&#x27; work found a larger audience in the 1960s, at first his analysis of the process was misunderstood as an extension of discredited &quot;social Darwinism,&quot; the idea of upward &quot;progress&quot; was dismissed by reading it as consecutive history rather than a metaphor for a social process.

Elias came to write both in English and German. Almost all his work on the sociology of knowledge and the sciences was written in English, as was his seminal work in the sociology of sport, collected in &quot;The Quest for Excitement&quot;, written by Norbert Elias with Eric Dunning, and published in 1986. Bielefeld University&#x27;s Center for Sociology of Development in 1984 invited Norbert Elias to preside over a gathering of a host of his internationally distinguished fellows who in turn wanted to review and discuss Elias&#x27; most interesting theories on civilising processes in person.

In 1983, Elias established the Norbert Elias Foundation to administer his legacy after his death. The initial members of the board of the foundation were Johan Goudsblom (Amsterdam), Hermann Korte (Münster) and Abraham van Stolk, the latter replaced after his death in 1996 by Stephen Mennell (Dublin). In 2017 a new board took over the management of the Foundation: Johan Heilbron (Rotterdam and Paris), Jason Hughes (Leicester), Adrian Jitschin (Frankfurt), and Arjan Post (Secretary, Amsterdam) 

Until he retired from the University of Leicester in 1962, Elias had published only one book, &quot;Über den Prozess der Zivilisation&quot;, and no more than a handful of articles. By the time of his death in 1990, he had published 15 books and something approaching 150 essays. He had always &quot;written&quot; a great deal, but found it very difficult ever to be satisfied with the results, and was very reluctant to release his work for publication. Still more curious, although he was such a perfectionist in his writing, he could rarely be persuaded to undertake such mundane tasks as reading and correcting the proofs. Thus, although his German works were well translated into English (for the most part by Edmund Jephcott), the original English editions contain many errors that could have been corrected by thorough proof-reading. In the early twenty-first century, therefore, the Norbert Elias Foundation entered into agreement with UCD Press, Dublin, to publish new scholarly editions of Elias&#x27;s work, running to 18 volumes.

==Collected works in English==
The new editions of Elias&#x27;s works, published by University College Dublin Press, have been carefully revised, cross-referenced and annotated (with notes especially about many historical people and events to which Elias makes reference), with a view to making them far more accessible to the reader. Especially important are the three volumes of Elias&#x27;s collected essays, many of which have not previously been published in English – or were published in such a scattered way or in obscure places that they were hitherto little known. (Other essays can also be found in &quot;Early Writings, Mozart &quot;and other volumes.)

<doc id="421119" wikidata="Q456649" url="?curid=421119" title="Maximus of Tyre">
<text>Maximus of Tyre (; fl. late 2nd century AD), also known as Cassius Maximus Tyrius, was a Greek rhetorician and philosopher who lived in the time of the Antonines and Commodus, and who belongs to the trend of the Second Sophistic. His writings contain many allusions to the history of Greece, while there is little reference to Rome; hence it is inferred that he lived longer in Greece, perhaps as a professor at Athens. Although nominally a Platonist, he is really a sophist rather than a philosopher, although he is still considered one of the precursors of Neoplatonism.

==Writings==
===The Dissertations===
There exist 41 essays or discourses on theological, ethical, and other philosophical subjects, collected into a work called &quot;The Dissertations&quot;. The central theme is God as the supreme being, one and indivisible though called by many names, accessible to reason alone:

In such a mighty contest, sedition and discord, you will see one according law and assertion in all the earth, that there is one God, the king and father of all things, and many gods, sons of God, ruling together with him.

As animals form the intermediate stage between plants and human beings, so there exist intermediaries between God and man, &quot;viz.&quot; daemons, who dwell on the confines of heaven and earth. The soul in many ways bears a great resemblance to the divinity; it is partly mortal, partly immortal, and, when freed from the fetters of the body, becomes a daemon. Life is the sleep of the soul, from which it awakes at death. The style of Maximus is superior to that of the ordinary sophistical rhetorician, but scholars differ widely as to the merits of the essays themselves.

Dissertation XX discusses &quot;Whether the Life of a Cynic is to Be Preferred&quot;. He begins with a narrative of how Prometheus created mankind, who initially lived a life of ease &quot;for the earth supplied them with aliment, rich meadows, long-haired mountains, and abundance of fruits&quot; – in other words, a Garden of Eden that resonates with Cynic ideas. It was &quot;a life without war, without iron, without a guard, peaceful, healthful unindigent&quot;.

Then, taking perhaps from Lucretius, he contrasts that Garden to mankind&#x27;s &quot;second life&quot;, which started with the division of the earth into property, which they then enclosed into fortifications and walls, and started to wear jewellery and gold, built houses, “molested the earth by digging into it for metals”, and invaded the sea and the air (killing animals, fish and birds), in what he described as a “slaughter and all-various gore, pursuing gratification of the body”. Humans became unhappy and, to compensate, sought wealth, “fearing poverty...dreading death...neglecting the care of life...They blamed base actions but did not abstain from them and “the hated to live, but dreaded to die”.

He then contrasts the two lives – that of the original Garden and of the “second life” he has just described and asks, which man would not choose the first, who “knows that by the change he shall be liberated from a multitude of evils” and what he calls “a dreadful prison of unhappy men, confined to a dreadful prison of unhappy men, confined in a dark recess, with large iron fetters round their feet, a great weight about their neck…passing their time in filth, in torment, and in weeping”. He asks, “Which of these images shall we proclaim blessed”? 

He goes on to praise Diogenes of Sinope, the Cynic, for choosing his ascetic life, but only because he avoided the often fearful fates of other philosophers – such as Socrates being condemned. But there is no mention of he himself taking up the ascetic life; rather he only talks about how the Garden would be preferable to the life mankind has made for itself. So it is unlikely he was a Cynic, but was just envious of that idealised pre-civilisation Life in the Garden.

Maximus of Tyre must be distinguished from the Stoic Claudius Maximus, tutor of Marcus Aurelius.

<doc id="421120" wikidata="Q2302752" url="?curid=421120" title="Mk 153 Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon">
<text>The Mk 153 Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW) is a smoothbore shoulder-fired rocket launcher. Primarily used as a portable assault weapon, or &quot;bunker buster,&quot; it also possesses secondary anti-armor capabilities. Developed from the Israeli B-300, the SMAW was introduced to the United States Armed Forces in 1984. While it retains similar external characteristics to the B-300, the American-redesigned SMAW features a key distinction: the integration of a 9×51mm spotting rifle, similar to the one used in the LAW 80. In fact, the SMAW’s spotting rifle and cartridges are an evolution of those developed for the LAW 80, enhancing target acquisition and improving hit probability.

The SMAW&#x27;s main purpose is to destroy bunkers, buildings, and light armored vehicles during assault operations, using high-explosive dual mode (HEDM) rockets. The SMAW can also engage armored vehicles using high-explosive anti-armor (HEAA) rockets, which has a maximum effective range of against a tank-sized target. Operations in Iraq also saw use of the SMAW-NE (Novel Explosive) rocket, a thermobaric rocket used to collapse buildings and cave openings. Within the U.S. Marine Corps, the SMAW was typically operated by Assaultmen and Combat Engineers. Each rifle company had an assault section that consisted of 13 Marines and six SMAW rocket launchers. Led by a section leader, the section was divided into three assault squads, each consisting of four Marines. Each squad was further split into two teams of two Marines, with each team equipped with one SMAW rocket launcher.
==Service history==
Serial production of the SMAW began in 1983, with the first units delivered in February 1984. By the completion of the initial contract in 1987, the U.S. manufacturer had supplied 1,828 Mk 153 launchers to the U.S. Marine Corps. The SMAW has since seen service with the U.S. Marine Corps in conflicts such as Operation Just Cause, the Gulf War, the War in Afghanistan, and the Iraq War.

During Operation Just Cause in Panama (1989), the U.S. Army recognized the need for a lightweight weapon capable of defeating bunkers, fortifications, and other fortified defensive structures. Despite this, the Army did not have a suitable weapon at the time. As a result, during Operation Desert Storm (1991), the Army had to borrow 125 Mk 153 Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapons (SMAW) from the U.S. Marine Corps. It became clear that the weapon, while effective, was too heavy and long for use by paratroopers. But, the Army&#x27;s standard M136 AT4 also proved unsuitable for bunker-busting. In response, the Army initiated the Multi-Purpose Individual Munition (MPIM) program in September 1991. This eventually lead to the adoption of the M141 BDM, a single-shot, disposable version of the Mk 153 SMAW using the same HEDM rocket.

In the early-2000s, the Mk 153 Mod 0 SMAW had a series of modifications to address several of its shortcomings. These modifications included a resleeving process for bubbled launch tubes, rewriting/drafting operator and technical manuals, a kit that will reduce environmental intrusion into the trigger mechanism, and an optical sight modification to allow the HEAA rocket to be used effectively against moving armor targets. Boresight bracket kits were also fielded that solved the loss of boresight problem between the launch tube and the spotting rifle. 

The Mk 153 SMAW has proven to be a vital asset in urban warfare, particularly during the Iraq War. In Iraq, it was extensively used in the Second Battle of Fallujah, where it demonstrated its effectiveness in destroying enemy-held buildings. Marines employed the SMAW Novel Explosive (SMAW-NE) thermobaric rocket to collapse structures and neutralize fortified positions. For instance, a single Marine reportedly leveled 12 buildings with 14 rockets in one day. The SMAW&#x27;s destructive capability significantly enhanced small-unit firepower, allowing infantry to engage entrenched enemies without relying solely on larger, less maneuverable systems like tanks. However, the SMAW-NE round lacked the penetrating power needed for certain walls in Fallujah. To overcome this, Marines would first use a High-Explosive Dual-Mode (HEDM) rocket to create a hole, then fire an NE rocket through the opening to collapse the structure. Despite occasional difficulties in wall breaching, the weapon proved to be an indispensable tool in urban assault operations.In 2023, Ukrainian forces, including the 68th Jager Brigade, used the Mk 153 SMAW in operations and training to combat Russian forces. Documented deployments showed the weapon&#x27;s role in urban combat and targeting fortified positions.

== Improvement Programs ==

===Follow-On To SMAW===
In 2002, the corps began a program to develop a successor to the SMAW system, tentatively titled &quot;Follow-On To SMAW&quot;. The contract was awarded to Lockheed Martin and Israel Military Industries (IMI); this resulted in the enhanced FGM-172 SRAW. In combat operations, it was ultimately used to augment, rather than replace, the SMAW system.

===SMAW II program===
In 2008, a replacement program was again initiated and titled the SMAW II. It was developed in tandem with a round capable of being fired from an enclosed area without ill effects on the environment and personnel. Its combined weight is — for the launcher, for the rocket. The contract was worth up to .

===SMAW II Serpent===

In 2012, Raytheon Missile Systems developed a SMAW II launcher named &quot;Serpent&quot;, and Nammo Talley developed new rounds for the Serpent. The Serpent is similar in many respects to the first SMAW launcher, except that it replaces the standard SMAW launcher&#x27;s spotting gun with more sophisticated fire control electronics. The sighting unit on the launcher is enclosed in a unique protective cage, which is also a carry handle. The development reduced the over-all weight by from the older SMAW launcher. The Serpent fires the same rounds as the standard SMAW and supports new and improved/enhanced rounds. But, the Serpent was never adopted for service, instead the USMC eventually adopted the Mk 153 Mod 2 to replace the service&#x27;s SMAW launchers by 2020.
==Variants==
=== Mk 153 Mod 0 ===

The Mk 153 Mod 0 SMAW fires rockets through an diameter launch tube. The system can fire a variety of encased rockets, such as the Mk 3 Mod 0 High-Explosive Dual Mode (HEDM) Rocket, the Mk 6 Mod 0 High-Explosive Anti-Armor (HEAA) Rocket, the Mk 7 Mod 0 Common Practice Rocket, and the Mk 80 Mod 0 Novel Explosive (NE) Rocket. The rocket encasements are loaded into the rear of the launcher, and the launch tube is constructed from a durable fiberglass-epoxy composite material with a gel coated bore.

The launcher consists of the launch tube, spotting rifle, electro-mechanical firing mechanism, mounting brackets, open battle sights and an optic mount for the Mk 42 Mod 0 day sight, RCO, AN/PVS-4 or AN/PVS-17C night sights. The system can also be aimed at night with an infrared aiming laser from the AN/PEQ-15 or AN/PEQ-16 in conjunction with night vision, since the IR laser is attached to the optic mount that can change elevation based on the range it is set to. The firing mechanism mechanically fires the spotting rifle and uses a magneto to fire the rocket. 

The spotting rifle is mounted on the right side of the launch tube and operates semi-automatically through primer actuation. When fired, the primer sets back, unlocking the breech and ejecting the spent round. The mounting brackets secure the spotting rifle to the launcher and allow for precise alignment adjustments to ensure the spotting rifle is properly aligned with the launch tube.

The 9×51mm Mk 217 Mod 0 spotting round is ballistically matched with the rocket, improving the gunner’s first-round hit probability. Spotting cartridges are stored in a six-round magazine located in the cap of the encased rocket. Each spotting round features a special 9mm projectile containing a tracer compound, which is crimped into a 7.62×51mm NATO casing, with a .22 Hornet primer.

=== Mk 153 Mod 1 ===

The Department of the Navy filed a patent application on October 30, 1995, for a design named &quot;Shoulder-launched multiple-purpose assault weapon&quot; that featured a rearrangement of the spotting rifle underneath the launch tube, with the patent officially granted and published on January 27, 1998. While it is unclear if this patent officially corresponds to the Mk 153 Mod 1, this reference includes a picture of the same design, labeled &quot;Mk 153 Mod 1 Launcher.&quot;

The rearranged spotting rifle was intended to make the weapon system more balanced and address accessibility issues found with the Mod 0, where the spotting rifle was mounted on the right side. This redesign aimed to streamline operations by centralizing the weapon&#x27;s controls and improving the gunner&#x27;s ability to reload the spotting rifle independently. It was claimed to offer improved reliability while also reducing the number of parts for easier maintenance, as well as reducing weight. There is no evidence the Mk 153 Mod 1 was ever adopted for service.

=== Mk 153 Mod 2 ===
The Mk 153 Mod 2 is an enhanced variant, featuring an electronic modular ballistic sight (MBS) in place of the 9 mm spotting system. The MBS system consists of the AN/PSQ-23A laser rangefinder and the AN/PAS-13G Light Weapon Thermal Sight (LWTS). To engage a target, the gunner first acquires the target using the thermal sight (AN/PAS-13G), which allows them to see the target in various environmental conditions. Once the target is acquired, the gunner depresses a button on the front grip to activate the laser rangefinder (AN/PSQ-23A). The rangefinder emits a laser pulse to measure the range to the target. This range data is then sent to the thermal sight, which processes the information and adjusts the reticle, displaying a chevron symbol that indicates the correct point of aim based on the range, external temperature, and selected rocket type. The gunner then aligns the chevron with the target and fires. The Mod 2 also has a reduced weight of with the MBS attached, along with other improvements, like increased pad size on the forward grip and foldable backup iron sights. The Mk 153 Mod 2 reached full operational capability (FOC) across the United States Marine Corps between 2019 and 2020.
== Rockets ==

* The Mk 3 Mod 0 Encased High-Explosive, Dual Mode (HEDM) rocket is effective against bunkers, masonry, concrete walls and light armor. It uses the Mk 420 Mod 0, a deceleration-based fuze located at the rear of the warhead, to automatically distinguish between soft targets (low deceleration) and hard targets (high deceleration). For hard targets, such as reinforced concrete walls or armored vehicles, the warhead’s aluminum casing mushrooms upon impact, increasing the contact surface area between the warhead and the target to maximize blast effects. For soft targets, the rocket employs a delayed detonation, enabling deeper penetration into structures like sandbag bunkers or buildings to maximize internal damage. The warhead is filled with Composition A-3, enhanced with powdered aluminum to increase the explosive’s energy output and overall destructive power. The HEDM round can penetrate of double-reinforced concrete walls, of brick, up to of rolled homogenous armor, or up to of wood-reinforced sandbags. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;High-Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP)&quot;, instead of HEDM, in some sources, but it clearly states &quot;Dual Mode&quot; in U.S. Marine Corps publications, on the rocket encasement, and on the rocket itself (as seen in the picture below).
* The Mk 4 Mod 0 Encased, Practice and Mk 7 Mod 0 Encased, Common Practice rockets are used in training. The warhead consists of a blue plastic projectile attached to a rocket motor similar to the HEDM rocket. The rocket contains no explosive. It does not damage a target except by kinetic energy. On impact, the plastic warhead ruptures, dispensing an inert white spotting powder.
* The Mk 6 Mod 0 Encased High-Explosive, Anti-Armor (HEAA) rocket is effective against current tanks without added armor, and uses a standoff rod on the detonator, allowing the explosive force to be focused on a small point and for maximum damage against targets. The HEAA round can penetrate up to the equivalent of of rolled homogeneous armor. The unit cost of the Mk 6 HEAA round is $25,000.
* The Mk 80 Mod 0 Encased Novel Explosive (SMAW-NE) rocket is effective against caves, buildings, and bunkers. The SMAW-NE has an enhanced-blast warhead with a charge of PBXN-113 and a slightly modified version of the dual mode fuze used by the HEDM rocket, the Mk 420 Mod 1. The Indian Head Naval Surface Warfare Center teamed with Marine Corps Systems Command and Talley Defense Systems to respond to an urgent U.S. Marine Corps need for a shoulder-launched enhanced-blast warhead in 2003. It was used in combat during both the first and second offensives in Fallujah, in 2004.
=== Backblast Area ===
As with all of these types of recoilless rocket weapons, the backblast that is created when it is fired is a primary safety concern. When the rocket is fired, the rocket propellant is expended entirely within the rocket encasement. This is the cause of the extremely loud and violent backblast. This backblast extends in a 90-meter, 60° cone to the rear of the weapon. The backblast is lethal out to and still extremely dangerous to . An assistant gunner is often used during employment of the weapon system to monitor the backblast area and clear it of fellow troops, or to notify the gunner of obstructions that could reflect the force of the backblast back at the gun team. The gunner is only cleared to launch a rocket when he hears the command &quot;Backblast area secure&quot; from his assistant gunner.

<text>The Coulomb barrier, named after Coulomb&#x27;s law, which is in turn named after physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, is the energy barrier due to electrostatic interaction that two nuclei need to overcome so they can get close enough to undergo a nuclear reaction.

==Potential energy barrier==
This energy barrier is given by the electric potential energy:
:formula_1
where
:&quot;ε&quot;0 is the permittivity of free space;
:&quot;q&quot;1, &quot;q&quot;2 are the charges of the interacting particles;
:&quot;r&quot; is the interaction radius.

A positive value of &quot;U&quot; is due to a repulsive force, so interacting particles are at higher energy levels as they get closer. A negative potential energy indicates a bound state (due to an attractive force).

The Coulomb barrier increases with the atomic numbers (i.e. the number of protons) of the colliding nuclei:
:formula_2
where &quot;e&quot; is the elementary charge, and &quot;Zi&quot; the corresponding atomic numbers.

To overcome this barrier, nuclei have to collide at high velocities, so their kinetic energies drive them close enough for the strong interaction to take place and bind them together.

According to the kinetic theory of gases, the temperature of a gas is just a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in that gas. For classical ideal gases the velocity distribution of the gas particles is given by Maxwell–Boltzmann. From this distribution, the fraction of particles with a velocity high enough to overcome the Coulomb barrier can be determined.

In practice, temperatures needed to overcome the Coulomb barrier turned out to be smaller than expected due to quantum mechanical tunnelling, as established by Gamow. The consideration of barrier-penetration through tunnelling and the speed distribution gives rise to a limited range of conditions where fusion can take place, known as the Gamow window.

The absence of the Coulomb barrier enabled the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932.

== Potential energy barrier models ==
There is keen interest in the mechanics and parameters of nuclear fusion, including methods of modeling the Coulomb barrier for scientific and educational purposes. The Coulomb barrier is a type of potential energy barrier, and is central to nuclear fusion. It results from the interplay of two fundamental interactions: the strong interaction at close-range within ≈ 1 femtometre (fm), and the electromagnetic interaction at far-range beyond the Coulomb barrier. 

The microscopic range of the strong interaction, as well as it&#x27;s odd behavior relative to other fundamental forces, present a challenge to model and no classical examples exist on the human scale. Gravitational and electrostatic forces scale with the inverse of the square of the distance between them. But at short distances, the strong force is attractive and actually &quot;increases&quot; with distance (up to about 1 fm), beyond which the interaction transitions abruptly to repulsion. A visual and tactile classroom model of this strange behavior garnered first prize at the 2023 national apparatus competition of the American Academy of Physics Teachers in Sacramento, California. The apparatus uses circular arrays of alternating antiparallel double N and single S magnets to generate asymmetric alternating N/S magnetic fields that result in strong magnetic attraction within ≈ 1cm, and weaker repulsion at a distance beyond ≈ 1cm. Instructions for how to build an inexpensive 3D printed model of the magnetic &quot;Coulomb&quot; barrier apparatus are included in a follow-on &quot;Physics Education&quot; publication. 

Magnetic and electric forces were unified within the electromagnetic fundamental force by James Clerk Maxwell in 1873 in A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism. In the case of the magnetic &quot;Coulomb&quot; barrier apparatus, a potential energy barrier arises between alternating/unequal asymmetric North/South &quot;magnetic&quot; poles, as described in a related magnetic potential energy barrier patent (US11,087,910 B2). An included method extends the phenomenon to further include the modelling of an electrostatic potential energy barrier, as well, using alternating/unequal positive and negative &quot;electrostatic&quot; charges. A potential energy barrier and fusion potential curve are shown to arise between a pair of deuterons, each modelled as a linear arrangement of six regularly-spaced up (+2/3) and down (-1/3) quark charges.

<doc id="421127" wikidata="Q1775056" url="?curid=421127" title="Jerome Rothenberg">
<text>Jerome Rothenberg (December 11, 1931 – April 21, 2024) was an American poet, translator and anthologist, noted for his work in the fields of ethnopoetics and performance poetry. Rothenberg co-founded the method of ethnopoetics with Dennis Tedlock in the late 1960s.

==Early life and education==
Jerome Rothenberg was born and raised in New York City, the son of Polish-Jewish immigrant parents, and is a descendant of the Talmudist rabbi Meir of Rothenburg. He attended the City College of New York, graduating in 1952, and in 1953 he received a Master&#x27;s Degree in Literature from the University of Michigan. Rothenberg served in the U.S. Army in Mainz, Germany, from 1953 to 1955, after which he did further graduate study at Columbia University, finishing in 1959. He lived in New York City until 1972, when he moved first to the Allegany Seneca Reservation in western New York State, and later to San Diego, California, where he was living at the time of his death.

==Career==
In the late 1950s, he published translations of German poets, including the first English translation of poems by Paul Celan and Günter Grass, among others. He also founded &quot;Hawk&#x27;s Well Press&quot; and the magazines &quot;Poems from the Floating World&quot; and &quot;some/thing&quot;, the latter with David Antin, publishing work by important American avant-garde poets, as well as his first collection, &quot;White Sun Black Sun&quot; (1960). He wrote works which he described as deep image in the 1950s and early 1960s, during that time publishing eight more collections, and the first of his extensive anthologies of traditional and modern poetry, &quot;Technicians of the Sacred: A Range of Poems from Africa, America, Asia, &amp; Oceania&quot; (1968, revised and expanded 1985). By the end of the 1960s, he had also become active in poetry performance, had adapted a play (&quot;The Deputy&quot; by Rolf Hochhuth, 1964) for Broadway production and had opened the range of his experimental work well beyond the earlier “deep image” poetry.

His works are often read and analyzed in college English classes, such as in the course, &quot;Poetry From Planet Earth,&quot; offered at Dawson College.

===Ethnopoetics and anthologies===
&quot;Technicians of the Sacred&quot; (1968), which signalled the beginning of an approach to poetry that Rothenberg, in collaboration with George Quasha, named “ethnopoetics”, went beyond the standard collection of folk songs to include visual and sound poetry and the texts and scenarios for ritual events. Some 150 pages of commentaries gave context to the works included and placed them as well in relation to contemporary and experimental work in the industrial and post-industrial West. In 1969 Rothenberg&#x27;s work was published in 0 to 9 magazine, an avant-garde publication which experimented with language and meaning-making. Over the next ten years, Rothenberg also founded, and with Dennis Tedlock, co-edited &quot;Alcheringa&quot;, the first magazine of ethnopoetics (1970–73, 1975ff.) and edited further anthologies, including: &quot;Shaking the Pumpkin: Traditional Poetry of the Indian North Americas&quot; (1972, 2014); &quot;A Big Jewish Book: Poems &amp; Other Visions of the Jews from Tribal Times to Present&quot; (revised and republished as &quot;Exiled in the Word&quot;, 1977 and 1989); &quot;America a Prophecy: A New Reading of American Poetry from Pre-Columbian Times to the Present&quot; (1973, 2012), co-edited with George Quasha; and &quot;Symposium of the Whole: A Range of Discourse Toward An Ethnopoetics&quot; (1983), co-edited with Diane Rothenberg.

Rothenberg’s approach throughout was to treat these large collections as deliberately constructed assemblages or collages, on the one hand, and as manifestos promulgating a complex and multiphasic view of poetry on the other. Speaking of their relation to his work as a whole, he later wrote of the anthology thus conceived as &quot;an assemblage or pulling together of poems &amp; people &amp; ideas about poetry (&amp; much else) in the words of others and in [my] own words.&quot;

===1970–1990===
In 1970 the first version of Rothenberg&#x27;s selected poems appeared as &quot;Poems for the Game of Silence&quot; (2000), and soon after that he became one of the poets published regularly by New Directions. Provoked by his own ethnopoetic anthologies, he began, as he wrote of it, “to construct an ancestral poetry of my own – in a world of Jewish mystics, thieves, &amp; madmen.” The first work to emerge from that, both thematically and formally, was &quot;Poland/1931&quot; (1974), described by the poet David Meltzer as Rothenberg&#x27;s “surrealist Jewish vaudeville”. Over the next two decades Rothenberg expanded this theme in works such as &quot;A Big Jewish Book&quot; and &quot;Khurbn &amp; Other Poems&quot;, the latter an approach to holocaust writing, which had otherwise been no more than a subtext in &quot;Poland/1931&quot;.

Rothenberg also re-explored Native American themes in &quot;A Seneca Journal&quot; (1978), and the relation of his work to Dada and Surrealism culminated in a further cycle of poems, &quot;That Dada Strain&quot;, in 1983. A merger of experimental sound poetry and ethnopoetics was the basis in the 1970s and 1980s of works composed by an approach that he was calling “total translation&quot;, most notably &quot;The 17 Horse Songs of Frank Mitchell&quot; translated from the Navajo language with a privileging of sonic effect alongside strict or literal meaning. Compositions such as these became centerpieces of Rothenberg&#x27;s expanding performance repertory and underlie his critical writings on the poetics of performance, many of which were gathered together in &quot;Pre-Faces &amp; Other Writings&quot; (1981). During this time and beyond it, he also engaged in a number of collaborations with musicians – Charlie Morrow, Bertram Turetzky, Pauline Oliveros, and George E. Lewis, among others – and took part, sometimes performing, in theatricalizations of his poetry: &quot;Poland/1931&quot; for The Living Theater and &quot;That Dada Strain&quot; for Westdeutscher Rundfunk in Germany and the Center for Theater Science &amp; Research in San Diego and New York. His &quot;New Selected Poems 1970-1985&quot;, covering the period since &quot;Poems for the Game of Silence&quot;, appeared in 1986.

===1990s–2010s===
In 1987, Rothenberg received his first tenured professorship at the State University of New York in Binghamton, but returned to California in 1989, where he taught for the next ten years as a professor of visual arts and literature at the University of California, San Diego. The works published since 1990 include more than fifteen books of his own poetry as well as four books of poetry in translation – from Schwitters, Lorca, Picasso, and Nezval – and a book of selected translations, &quot;Writing Through&quot;, which extends the idea of translation to practices like collage, assemblage, and appropriation. In 1994 he published &quot;Gematria&quot;. In 1995 and 1998 he published, in collaboration with Pierre Joris, the two-volume anthology-assemblage &quot;Poems for the Millennium: The University of California Book of Modern and Postmodern Poetry&quot;, and in 2000, with Steven Clay, &quot;A Book of the Book: Some Works &amp; Projections About the Book &amp; Writing&quot;.

Rothenberg published a new book of selected essays, &quot;Poetics &amp; Polemics 1980–2005&quot;, in 2008, and volume three of &quot;Poems for the Millennium&quot;, co-edited with Jeffrey C. Robinson as a nineteenth-century prequel to the first two volumes, in 2009. Numerous translated editions of his writings have appeared in French, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Portuguese, and other languages, and a complete French edition of &quot;Technicians of the Sacred&quot; appeared in 2008. 

An expanded 50th Anniversary Edition of &quot;Technicians of the Sacred&quot; appeared in 2017 and received a PEN Oakland Josephine Miles Literary Award in 2018. Charles Bernstein has written of him: “The significance of Jerome Rothenberg&#x27;s animating spirit looms larger every year. … [He] is the ultimate &#x27;hyphenated&#x27; poet: critic-anthropologist-editor-anthologist-performer-teacher-translator, to each of which he brings an unbridled exuberance and an innovator&#x27;s insistence on transforming a given state of affairs.&quot; In 2014, work from Rothenberg appeared in the second issue of &quot;The Literati Quarterly&quot;.

==Death==
Rothenberg died at his home in Encinitas, California on April 21, 2024, at the age of 92. He is survived by his wife and collaborator of 71 years, Diane.

<doc id="421129" wikidata="Q54802" url="?curid=421129" title="Cob (material)">
<text>Cob, cobb, or clom (in Wales) is a natural building material made from subsoil, water, fibrous organic material (typically straw), and sometimes lime. The contents of subsoil vary, and if it does not contain the right mixture, it can be modified with sand or clay. Cob is fireproof, termite proof, resistant to seismic activity, and uses low-cost materials, although it is very labour intensive. It can be used to create artistic and sculptural forms, and its use has been revived in recent years by the natural building and sustainability movements.

In technical building and engineering documents, such as the Uniform Building Code of the western USA, cob may be referred to as &quot;unburned clay masonry,&quot; when used in a structural context. It may also be referred to as &quot;aggregate&quot; in non-structural contexts, such as &quot;clay and sand aggregate,&quot; or more simply &quot;organic aggregate,&quot; such as where cob is a filler between post and beam construction.

==History and usage==
&quot;Cob&quot; is an English term attested to around the year 1600 for an ancient building material that has been used for building since prehistoric times. The use of this material in Iran is more than 4000 years old. The etymology of &quot;cob&quot; and &quot;cobbing&quot; is unclear, but in several senses means to &quot;beat&quot; or &quot;strike&quot;, which is how cob material is applied to a wall.

Many similar materials and methods of earthen building are used around the world, such as &quot;adobe&quot;, &quot;lump clay&quot;, &quot;puddled clay&quot;, &quot;chalk mud&quot;, &quot;wychert&quot;, &quot;clay daubins&quot;, &quot;swish&quot; (Asante Twi), &quot;torchis&quot; (French), &quot;bauge&quot; (French), &quot;bousille&quot; (French mud with moss), beaten clay-&quot;pahsa&quot; (Central Asia), and &quot;cat and clay&quot;.

Cob structures can be found in a variety of climates across the globe. European examples include:

* in England, notably in the counties of Devon and Cornwall in the West Country, and in East Anglia (where it is referred to as &quot;clay lump&quot;)
* in Wales, notably in rural Anglesey
* in Donegal Bay in Ulster and in Munster, South-West Ireland
* in Finisterre and Ille-et-Vilaine in Brittany, where many homes have survived over 500 years and are still inhabited

Some of the oldest human-made structures in Afghanistan are composed of rammed earth and cob. Cobwork (&quot;tabya&quot;) was used in the Maghreb and al-Andalus in the 11th and 12th centuries, and was described in detail by Ibn Khaldun in the 14th century.

Many old cob buildings can be found in Africa, the Middle East, and the southwestern United States like the Taos Pueblo. A number of cob cottages survive from mid-19th-century New Zealand.

Traditionally, English cob was made by mixing the clay-based subsoil with sand, straw and water using oxen to trample it. English soils contain varying amounts of chalk, and cob made with significant amounts of chalk are called &quot;chalk cob&quot; or &quot;wychert&quot;. The earthen mixture was then ladled onto a stone foundation in courses and trodden onto the wall by workers in a process known as &quot;cobbing&quot;. The construction would progress according to the time required for the prior course to dry. After drying, the walls would be trimmed and the next course built, with lintels for later openings such as doors and windows being placed as the wall takes shape.

The walls of a cob house are generally about thick, and windows were correspondingly deep-set, giving the homes a characteristic internal appearance. The thick walls provided excellent thermal mass which was easy to keep warm in winter and cool in summer. Walls with a high thermal mass value act as a thermal buffer inside the home. The material has a long life-span even in rainy or humid climates, provided a tall foundation and large roof overhang are present

Cob is fireproof, while &quot;fire cob&quot; (cob without straw or fiber) is a refractory material (the same material, essentially, as unfired common red brick), and historically, has been used to make chimneys, fireplaces, forges and crucibles. Without fiber, however, cob loses most of its tensile strength.

==Modern cob buildings==
When Kevin McCabe constructed a two-story, four bedroom cob house in England, UK in 1994, it was reputedly the first cob residence built in the country in 70 years. His techniques remained very traditional; the only innovations he made were using a tractor to mix the cob and adding sand or shillet, a gravel of crushed shale, to reduce shrinkage.

 From 2002 to 2004, sustainability enthusiast Rob Hopkins initiated the construction of a cob house for his family, the first new one in Ireland in circa one hundred years. It was a community project, but an unidentified arsonist destroyed it shortly before completion. The house, located at The Hollies Centre for Practical Sustainability in County Cork, was being rebuilt as of 2010. There are a number of other completed modern cob houses and more are planned, including a public education centre.

In 2000-01, a modern, four bedroom cob house in Worcestershire, England, UK, designed by Associated Architects, was sold for £999,000. Cobtun House was erected in 2001 and won the Royal Institute of British Architects&#x27; Sustainable Building of the Year award in 2005. The total construction cost was £300,000, but the metre (yard) thick outer cob wall cost only £20,000.

In the Pacific Northwest of the United States there has been a resurgence of cob construction, both as an alternative building practice and one desired for its form, function, and cost effectiveness. Pat Hennebery, Tracy Calvert, Elke Cole, and the Cobworks workshops erected more than ten cob houses in the Southern Gulf Islands of British Columbia, Canada.

In 2010, Sota Construction Services in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, completed construction on its new 7,500 square foot corporate headquarters, which featured exterior cob walls along with other energy saving features like radiant heat flooring, a rooftop solar panel array, and daylighting. The cob walls, in conjunction with the other sustainable features, enabled the edifice to earn a LEED Platinum rating in 2012, and it also received one of the highest scores by percentage of total points earned in any LEED category.

In 2007, Ann and Gord Baird began constructing a two-storey cob house in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, for an estimated $210,000 CDN. The home of 2,150 square feet includes heated floors, solar panels, and a southern exposure to enable passive solar heating.

Welsh architect Ianto Evans and researcher Linda Smiley refined the construction technique known as &quot;Oregon Cob&quot; in the 1980s and 1990s. Oregon Cob integrates the variation of wall layup technique which uses loaves of mud mixed with sand and straw with a rounded architectural stylism. They are experimenting with a mixture of cob and straw bale denominated &quot;balecob&quot;.

==Cob building code==
In 2019 an appendix for the International Residential Code (IRC) was approved by a vote in the public comment hearings. Appendix U of the IRC governs use of cob in load-bearing walls of single story residential structures. Based on currently available test data, the appendix limits the conditions under which cob may be used without engineering approval, such as seismic activity.

<text>The Freedom Socialist Party (FSP) is a Trotskyist and socialist feminist political party in the United States. FSP formed in 1966, when its members split from the Socialist Workers Party. FSP views the struggles of women, people of color and sexual minorities as intrinsic to the struggle of the working class. Notable FSP members include Megan Cornish, Heidi Durham, Richard S. Fraser, and Clara Fraser.

== Membership ==
FSP has branches in the United States, as well as Australia, England, Germany and New Zealand. FSP is affiliated with Radical Women, a socialist feminist organization.

== History ==

=== Background ===
The immediate forerunner of FSP was the Kirk-Kaye tendency within the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), led by Richard S. Fraser (Kirk) and Clara Fraser (Kaye) who were then married.

The Kirk-Kaye tendency primarily disagreed with SWP leadership on three points: The Kirk-Kaye tendency supported revolutionary integrationism, in contrast to the SWP&#x27;s support for Black nationalism and the Nation of Islam.
The Kirk-Kaye tendency argued that socialist feminism must be a top priority for socialist organizations. And the Kirk-Kaye tendency claimed that the SWP was undemocratic.

=== Founding ===
FSP formed in 1966, when its members split from the Socialist Workers Party. The party&#x27;s Seattle branch, with support from individuals in other cities, split off from the SWP over what it described as the SWP&#x27;s entrenched opportunism and undemocratic methods.

FSP advocated for class solidarity of Black and white workers, called for a greatly expanded understanding of and attention to women&#x27;s emancipation, and urged the anti-war movement to support the socialist, anti-colonial aims of the Vietnamese Revolution.

FSP became a pole of attraction for Seattle leftists opposed to the SWP&#x27;s internal politics and established a home at Freeway Hall. The party formed Radical Women with the dual goal of building a revolutionary socialist feminist organization and teaching women the organizational and leadership skills that were often denied to them in male-dominated organizations.

=== Subsequent history ===
In 1978, FSP joined the Committee for a Revolutionary Socialist Party (CRSP), an attempted united front of Trotskyist parties. In 1980, CRSP collapsed.

In 1989, FSP founded the United Front Against Fascism (UFAF), an anti-fascist organization that included a broad coalition of the Left, the LGBT community, labor unionists, feminists, people of color, Jews, and civil libertarians. UFAF took the lead in mobilizing against neo-Nazis in the Pacific Northwest in the 1980s and 1990s.

In 1991, the Seattle FSP ran two members for Seattle City Council, Heidi Durham and Yolanda Alaniz, who campaigned on guaranteed income for families living in poverty, community control of the police, and domestic partnership rights for same-sex couples.

In 2003, Lyndon LaRouche filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission that FSP&#x27;s &quot;Red Letter Press&quot; and its managing editor, Helen Gilbert, had violated campaign finance laws. Gilbert had issued a pamphlet critical of LaRouche&#x27;s ideology and political history. The FEC found LaRouche&#x27;s complaint to be without merit and dismissed it.

== Ideology ==
FSP is a Trotskyist revolutionary socialist organization. FSP leaders Clara Fraser and Gloria Martin hoped to build a Leninist party that is &quot;socialist-feminist&quot; in ideology and practice.

== Election results ==
FSP has fielded electoral candidates in the United States for local, state, and federal offices. FSP candidates usually run as official FSP candidates.

No FSP candidate has yet won an election.

=== Presidential elections ===
In 2016, FSP critically endorsed Jeff Mackler of Socialist Action for president.

In 2020, FSP again critically endorsed Jeff Mackler of Socialist Action for president.

In 2024, FSP declined to make a presidential endorsement and instead suggested voters spoil their ballots by writing-in &quot;free Palestine.&quot;

<doc id="421135" wikidata="Q334154" url="?curid=421135" title="Giambattista della Porta">
<text>Giambattista della Porta (; 1535 – 4 February 1615), also known as Giovanni Battista Della Porta, was an Italian scholar, polymath and playwright who lived in Naples at the time of the Renaissance, Scientific Revolution and Counter-Reformation.

Giambattista della Porta spent the majority of his life on scientific endeavours. He benefited from an informal education of tutors and visits from renowned scholars. His most famous work, first published in 1558, is entitled &quot;Magia Naturalis (Natural Magic).&quot; In this book he covered a variety of the subjects he had investigated, including occult philosophy, astrology, alchemy, mathematics, meteorology, and natural philosophy. He was also referred to as &quot;professor of secrets&quot;.

==Childhood==
Giambattista della Porta was born at Vico Equense, near Naples, to the nobleman Nardo Antonio della Porta. He was the third of four sons and the second to survive childhood, having an older brother Gian Vincenzo and a younger brother Gian Ferrante. Della Porta had a privileged childhood including his education. His father had a thirst for learning, a trait he would pass on to all of his children. He surrounded himself with distinguished people and entertained the likes of philosophers, mathematicians, poets, and musicians. The atmosphere of the house resembled an academy for his sons. The members of the learned circle of friends stimulated the boys, tutoring and mentoring them, under the strict guidance of their father.

In addition to having talents for the sciences and mathematics, all the brothers were also extremely interested in the arts, music in particular. Despite their interest, none of them possessed any sort of talent for it, but they did not allow that to stifle their progress in learning theory. They were all accepted into the Scuola di Pitagora, a highly exclusive academy of musicians.

More aware of their social position than the idea that his sons could have professions in science, Nardo Antonio raised the boys more as gentlemen than as scholars. Therefore, the boys struggled to learn to sing, as that was considered a courtly accomplishment of gentlemen. They were taught to dance, ride, perform well in tournaments and games, and dress well. The training gave della Porta, at least earlier in his life, a taste for the finer aspects of privileged living.

==Scientific disciplines==
In 1563, della Porta published &quot;De Furtivis Literarum Notis&quot;, a work about cryptography. In it, he described the first known digraphic substitution cipher. Charles J. Mendelsohn commented:


Della Porta invented a method which allowed him to write secret messages on the inside of eggs. Some of his friends were imprisoned by the Inquisition. At the gate of the prison, everything was checked except for eggs. Della Porta wrote messages on the eggshell using a mixture made of plant pigments and alum. The ink penetrated the eggshell which is semi-porous. When the eggshell was dry, he boiled the egg in hot water and the ink on the outside of the egg was washed away. When the recipient in prison peeled off the shell, the message was revealed once again on the egg white. &quot;De Furtivis Literarum Notis&quot; also contains one of the earliest known examples of music substitution ciphers.

In 1586 della Porta published a work on physiognomy, &quot;De humana physiognomonia libri IIII&quot; (1586). This influenced the Swiss eighteenth-century pastor Johann Kaspar Lavater as well as the 19th-century criminologist Cesare Lombroso. Della Porta wrote extensively on a wide spectrum of subjects throughout his life – for instance, an agricultural encyclopedia entitled &quot;Villa&quot; as well as works on meteorology, optics, and astronomy.

In 1589, on the eve of the early modern Scientific Revolution, della Porta became the first person to attack in print, on experimental grounds, the ancient assertion that garlic could disempower magnets. This was an early example of the authority of early authors being replaced by experiment as the backing for a scientific assertion. Della Porta&#x27;s conclusion was confirmed experimentally by Thomas Browne, among others.

In later life, della Porta collected rare specimens and grew exotic plants. His work &quot;Phytognomonica&quot; lists plants according to their geographical location. In &quot;Phytognomonica&quot; the first observation of fungal spores is recorded, making him a pioneer of mycology.

His private museum was visited by travellers and was one of the earliest examples of natural history museums. It inspired the Jesuit Athanasius Kircher to begin a similar, even more renowned, collection in Rome.

==Pioneering scientific society==
Della Porta was the founder of a scientific society called the &quot;Academia Secretorum Naturae (Accademia dei Segreti).&quot; This group was more commonly known as the &quot;Otiosi&quot;, (Men of Leisure). Founded sometime before 1580, the Otiosi were one of the first scientific societies in Europe and their aim was to study the &quot;secrets of nature.&quot; Any person applying for membership had to demonstrate they had made a new discovery in the natural sciences.

The &quot;Academia Secretorum Naturae&quot; was compelled to disband when its members were suspected of dealing with the occult. Della Porta was summoned to Rome by Pope Gregory XIII. Though he personally emerged from the meeting unscathed, the &quot;Academia Secretorum Naturae&quot; disbanded. Despite this incident, della Porta remained religiously devout and became a lay Jesuit brother.

Della Porta joined The Academy of the Lynxes in 1610.

==Technological contributions==

His interest in a variety of disciplines resulted in the technological advances of the following: agriculture, hydraulics, Military Engineering, instruments, and pharmacology. He published a book in 1606 on raising water by the force of the air. In 1608 he published a book on military engineering, and another on distillation.

Additionally, della Porta perfected the camera obscura. In a later edition of his &quot;Natural Magic&quot;, della Porta described this device as having a convex lens. Though he was not the inventor, the popularity of this work helped spread knowledge of it. He compared the shape of the human eye to the lens in his camera obscura, and provided an easily understandable example of how light could bring images into the eye.

Della Porta also claimed to have invented the first telescope, but died while preparing the treatise () in support of his claim. His efforts were also overshadowed by Galileo Galilei&#x27;s improvement of the telescope in 1609, following its introduction by Lippershey in the Netherlands in 1608.

In the book, della Porta also mentioned an imaginary device known as a &quot;sympathetic telegraph&quot;. The device consisted of two circular boxes, similar to compasses, each with a magnetic needle, supposed to be magnetized by the same lodestone. Each box was to be labelled with the 26 letters, instead of the usual directions. Della Porta assumed that this would coordinate the needles such that when a letter was dialled in one box, the needle in the other box would swing to point to the same letter, thereby helping in communicating.

==Religious complications==
A Catholic, della Porta was examined by the Inquisition in the years prior to 1578. He was forced to disband his &quot;Academia Secretorum Naturae&quot;, and in 1592 his philosophical works were prohibited from further publication by the Church; the ban was lifted in 1598. Porta&#x27;s involvement with the Inquisition puzzles historians due to his active participation in charitable Jesuit works by 1585. A possible explanation for this lies in Porta&#x27;s personal relations with Fra Paolo Sarpi after 1579.

==Playwright==
The 17 theatrical works that have survived from a total of perhaps 21 or 23 works comprise 14 comedies, one tragicomedy, one tragedy and one liturgical drama.

&quot;Comedies&quot;

* Lo Astrologo;
* La Carbonaria;
* La Chiappinaria;
* La Cintia;
* Gli Duoi fratelli rivali;
* La Fantesca;
* La Furiosa;
* Il Moro;
* L&#x27;Olimpia;
* I Simili;
* La Sorella;
* La Tabernaria;
* La Trappolaria;
* La Turca

&quot;Others&quot;

* La Penelope (tragicomedy);
* L&#x27;Ulisse (tragedy);
* Il Giorgio (liturgical drama)

Although they belong to the lesser-known tradition of the commedia erudita rather than the commedia dell&#x27;arte - which means they were written out as entire scripts instead of being improvised from a scenario - della Porta&#x27;s comedies are eminently performable. While there are obvious similarities between some of the characters in della Porta&#x27;s comedies and the masks of the commedia dell&#x27;arte, it should be borne in mind that the characters of the commedia erudita are uniquely created by the text in which they appear, unlike the masks, which remain constant from one scenario to another. Indeed, the masks of the improvised theatre evolved as stylised versions of recurring character types in written comedies. One of Della Porta&#x27;s most notable stock characters was the or , a gluttonous trickster whose lack of moral scruples enabled him to pull off stunts that initially might risk bringing the plot crashing down, but ended up winning the day in unexpected ways. The term was translated by John Florio in his Italian to English Dictionary first published in 1598 as . Perhaps the best example of this type is Morfeo in the comedy &quot;La Fantesca&quot;.

<text>An endoscope is an inspection instrument composed of image sensor, optical lens, light source and mechanical device, which is used to look deep into the body by way of openings such as the mouth or anus. A typical endoscope applies several modern technologies including optics, ergonomics, precision mechanics, electronics, and software engineering. With an endoscope, it is possible to observe lesions that cannot be detected by X-ray, making it useful in medical diagnosis. An endoscope uses tubes only a few millimeters thick to transfer illumination in one direction and high-resolution video in the other, allowing minimally invasive surgeries. It is used to examine the internal organs like the throat or esophagus. Specialized instruments are named after their target organ. Examples include the cystoscope (bladder), nephroscope (kidney), bronchoscope (bronchus), arthroscope (joints) and colonoscope (colon), and laparoscope (abdomen or pelvis). They can be used to examine visually and diagnose, or assist in surgery such as an arthroscopy.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Endo-&quot; is a scientific Latin prefix derived from Ancient Greek ἐνδο- (endo-) meaning &quot;within&quot;, and &quot;-scope&quot; comes from the modern Latin &quot;-scopium&quot;, from the Greek σκοπεῖν (skopein) meaning to &quot;look at&quot; or &quot;to examine&quot;.

== History ==

The first endoscope was developed in 1806 by German physician Philipp Bozzini with his introduction of a &quot;Lichtleiter&quot; (light conductor) &quot;for the examinations of the canals and cavities of the human body&quot;. However, the College of Physicians in Vienna disapproved of such curiosity. The first effective open-tube endoscope was developed by French physician Antonin Jean Desormeaux. He was also the first one to use an endoscope in a successful operation.

After the invention of Thomas Edison, the use of electric light was a major step in the improvement of endoscope. The first such lights were external although sufficiently capable of illumination to allow cystoscopy, hysteroscopy and sigmoidoscopy as well as examination of the nasal (and later thoracic) cavities as was being performed routinely in human patients by Sir Francis Cruise (using his own commercially available endoscope) by 1865 in the Mater Misericordiae Hospital in Dublin, Ireland. Later, smaller bulbs became available making internal light possible, for instance in a hysteroscope by Charles David in 1908.

Hans Christian Jacobaeus has been given credit for the first large published series of endoscopic explorations of the abdomen and the thorax with laparoscope (1912) and thoracoscope (1910) although the first reported thoracoscopic examination in a human was also by Cruise.

Laparoscope was used in the diagnosis of liver and gallbladder disease by Heinz Kalk in the 1930s. Hope reported in 1937 on the use of laparoscopy to diagnose ectopic pregnancy. In 1944, Raoul Palmer placed his patients in the Trendelenburg position after gaseous distention of the abdomen and thus was able to reliably perform gynecologic laparoscope.

Georg Wolf, a Berlin manufacturer of rigid endoscopes established in 1906, produced the Sussmann flexible gastroscope in 1911. Karl Storz began producing instruments for ENT specialists in 1945 through his company, Karl Storz GmbH.

=== Fiber optics ===

Basil Hirschowitz, Larry Curtiss, and Wilbur Peters invented the first fiber optic endoscope in 1957. Earlier in the 1950s Harold Hopkins had designed a &quot;fibroscope&quot; consisting of a bundle of flexible glass fibres able to coherently transmit an image. This proved useful both medically and industrially, and subsequent research led to further improvements in image quality.

The previous practice of a small filament lamp on the tip of the endoscope had left the choice of either viewing in a dim red light or increasing the light output – which carried the risk of burning the inside of the patient. Alongside the advances to the optics, the ability to &#x27;steer&#x27; the tip was developed, as well as innovations in remotely operated surgical instruments contained within the body of the endoscope itself. This was the beginning of &quot;key-hole surgery&quot; as we know it today.

=== Rod-lens endoscopes ===
There were physical limits to the image quality of a fibroscope. A bundle of 50,000 fibers would only give a 50,000-pixel image, and continued flexing from use breaks fibers and progressively loses pixels. Eventually, so many are lost that the whole bundle must be replaced at a considerable expense)
. Harold Hopkins realised that any further optical improvement would require a different approach. Previous rigid endoscopes suffered from low light transmittance and poor image quality. The surgical requirement of passing surgical tools as well as the illumination system within the endoscope&#x27;s tube which itself is limited in dimensions by the human body left very little room for the imaging optics. The tiny lenses of a conventional system required supporting rings that would obscure the bulk of the lens&#x27; area. They were also hard to manufacture and assemble and optically nearly useless.

The elegant solution that Hopkins invented was to fill the air-spaces between the &#x27;little lenses&#x27; with rods of glass. These rods fitted exactly the endoscope&#x27;s tube making them self-aligning and requiring of no other support. They were much easier to handle and utilised the maximum possible diameter available.

With the appropriate curvature and coatings to the rod ends and optimal choices of glass-types, all calculated and specified by Hopkins, the image quality was transformed even with tubes of only 1mm in diameter. With a high quality &#x27;telescope&#x27; of such small diameter the tools and illumination system could be comfortably housed within an outer tube. Once again, it was Karl Storz who produced the first of these new endoscopes as part of a long and productive partnership between the two men.

Whilst there are regions of the body that will always require flexible endoscopes (principally the gastrointestinal tract), the rigid rod-lens endoscopes have such exceptional performance that they are still the preferred instrument and have enabled modern key-hole surgery. (Harold Hopkins was recognized and honoured for his advancement of medical-optic by the medical community worldwide. It formed a major part of the citation when he was awarded the Rumford Medal by the Royal Society in 1984.)

== Composition ==

A typical endoscope is composed of following parts:

* A rigid or flexible tube as a body.
* A light transmission system that illuminates the object to be inpsected. For the light source, it is usually located outside the scope body. 
* A lens system that transmits the image from the objective lens to the observer, usually a relay lens system in the case of a rigid endoscope or a bundle of optical fibers in the case of a fiberoptic endoscope.
* An eyepiece which transmits the image to the screen in order to capture it. However, modern videoscopes require no eyepiece.
* An additional channel for medical instruments or manipulators (only for a multi-function endoscope, see below in &quot;Classification&quot;).

Besides, patients undergoing endoscopy procedure may be offered sedation in order to avoid discomfort.
== Clinical application ==

Endoscopes may be used to investigate symptoms in the digestive system including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, and gastrointestinal bleeding. It is also used in diagnosis, most commonly by performing a biopsy to check for conditions such as anemia, bleeding, inflammation, and cancers of the digestive system. The procedure may also be used for treatment such as cauterization of a bleeding vessel, widening a narrow esophagus, clipping off a polyp or removing a foreign object.

Health care workers can use endoscopes to review the following body parts:

* The gastrointestinal tract:
** Esophagus: chronic esophagitis, esophageal varices, esophageal hiatal hernia, esophageal leiomyoma, esophageal cancer, cardiac cancer, etc.
** Stomach and duodenum: chronic gastritis, gastric ulcer, benign gastric tumor, gastric cancer, duodenal ulcer, duodenal tumor.
** Small intestine: small intestine neoplasms, smooth muscle tumors, sarcomas, polyps, lymphomas, inflammation, etc.
** Large intestine: nonspecific ulcerative colitis, Crohn&#x27;s disease, chronic colitis, colonic polyps, colorectal cancer, etc.
* The pancreas and biliary tract:
** pancreatic cancer, cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma, etc.
* The laparoscopy:
** liver disease, biliary disease, etc.
* The respiratory tract:
** lung cancer, transbronchoscopy lung biopsy, selective bronchography, etc.
* The urinary tract:
** cystitis, bladder conjugation, bladder tumor, renal tuberculosis, renal stones, renal tumors, congenital malformations of ureter, ureteral stones, ureteral tumors, etc.
* The ear, nose and throat:
** Ear: tympanitis, inner ear deformity, etc.
** Nose: rhinitis, nasal polyp, etc.
** Throat: retropharyngeal abscess, specific infection, etc.

== Classification ==
There are many different types of endoscopes for medical examination, so are their classification methods. Generally speaking, the following three classifications are more common:

* According to functions of the endoscope: 
** single-function endoscope: A single-function endoscope refers to an observation mirror that only has an optical system with it. 
** multi-function endoscope: For a multi-functional endoscope, in addition to the function of observation, it also has at least one working channel like lighting, surgery, flushing and other functions.
* According to detection areas reached by the endoscope: 
** enteroscope
** otoscope
** colonoscope
** rhinoscope
** arthroscope
** laparoscope
** etc.
* According to rigidity of the endoscope: 
** rigid endoscope: A rigid endoscope is a prismatic optical system with advantages of clear imaging, multiple working channels and multiple viewpoints.
** flexible endoscope: A flexible endoscope is an optical-fiber-based system. Notable features of a flexible endoscope include that the lens can be manipulated by the operator to change direction, but the imaging quality is not as good as a rigid one.

== Recent developments ==

Robot assisted surgery

With the development and application of robotic systems, especially surgical robotics, remote surgery has been introduced, in which the surgeon could be at a site far away from the patient. The first remote surgery was called the Lindbergh Operation. And a wireless oesophageal pH measuring devices can now be placed endoscopically, to record ph trends in an area remotely.

Endoscopy VR simulators

Virtual reality simulators are being developed for training doctors on various endoscopy skills.

Disposable endoscopy

Disposable endoscopy is an emerging category of endoscopic instruments. Recent developments have allowed the manufacture of endoscopes inexpensive enough to be used on a single patient only. It is meeting a growing demand to lessen the risk of cross contamination and hospital acquired diseases. A European consortium of the SME is working on the DUET (disposable use of endoscopy tool) project to build a disposable endoscope.

Capsule endoscopy
Capsule endoscopes are pill-sized imaging devices that are swallowed by a patient and then record images of the gastrointestinal tract as they pass through naturally. Images are typically retrieved via wireless data transfer to an external receiver.

Augmented reality

The endoscopic images can be combined with other image sources to provide the surgeon with additional information. For instance, the position of an anatomical structure or tumor might be shown in the endoscopic video.

Image enhancement

Emerging endoscope technologies measure additional properties of light such as optical polarization, optical phase, and additional wavelengths of light to improve contrast.

== Non-medical use ==

Industrial endoscopic nondestructive testing technology

The above is mainly about the application of endoscopes in medical inspection. In fact, endoscopes are also widely used in industrial field, especially in non-destructive testing and hole exploration. If internal visual inspection of pipes, boilers, cylinders, motors, reactors, heat exchangers, turbines, and other products with narrow, inaccessible cavities and/or channels is to be performed, then the endoscope is an important, if not an indispensable instrument. In such applications they are commonly known as borescopes.

<doc id="421150" wikidata="Q2408149" url="?curid=421150" title="Son of the Beach">
<text>Son of the Beach is an American sitcom that aired from March 14, 2000, to October 1, 2002, on FX. The series is a spoof of &quot;Baywatch&quot;, with much of the comedy based on sexual double entendres, puns, innuendo and the like. A major running gag portrayed the handsome David Hasselhoff character as a balding, middle-aged, pot-bellied and out-of-shape man who is nonetheless seen by all the other characters as highly fit and attractive. Radio talk show host Howard Stern was one of the executive producers.

==Synopsis==
The show centered on the adventures of Shore Patrol Force 30 (SPF 30, a pun on the term &quot;Sun Protection Factor&quot;), led by the pasty, out-of-shape, clueless lifeguard Notch Johnson (Timothy Stack). The rest of his patrol consists of B.J. Cummings (the innocent blonde lifeguard), Jamaica St. Croix (the ghetto-raised, mix-raced lifeguard), Chip Rommel (the dumb, hunky, muscular male lifeguard who is a parody of Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Kimberlee Clark (the smart female lifeguard and of the series). Many of the plots revolved around silly action genre clichés and movie parodies, with many of the feature roles played by actors and celebrities such as Jason Alexander, Mark Hamill, Alan Thicke, Erik Estrada, Gary Coleman, John Salley, Joey Buttafuoco, Patty Hearst, Adam Carolla, Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf, George Takei, Gilbert Gottfried, Walter Koenig, Pat Morita, Anson Williams, Christopher Darden, Maureen McCormick, Lee Majors, David Arquette, Neil Patrick Harris, Musetta Vander, Angelica Bridges, Ian Ziering, RuPaul, and Dweezil Zappa.

The title is a pun on the phrase &quot;son of a bitch.&quot; Likewise, character names are rife with puns and innuendo. Porcelain Bidet, B.J. Cummings, Jamaica St. Croix (&quot;you make a saint cry&quot;), Anita Massengil, and Notch Johnson all refer to some sort of double entendre, while Chip Rommel&#x27;s name refers to the &quot;Desert Fox&quot;, further punctuating the fact that the character is German, his parents being &quot;The Rommels of Paraguay&quot; (South America was a refuge for hunted Nazis at the close of World War II). &quot;Notch&quot; and &quot;B.J.&quot; are also parodies of the names of the &quot;Baywatch&quot; characters played by David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson – Mitch and C. J. Kimberlee Clark&#x27;s name is a pun on the company Kimberly-Clark, manufacturer of paper products such as Kleenex and Kotex.

Kamisese Kapaiwai Tuimacilai Uluilakeba Mara was born on 6 May 1920, in Sawana, Lomaloma, Vanuabalavu in the archipelago of Lau, the son of &quot;Ratu&quot; Tevita Uluilakeba III, &quot;Tui Nayau&quot; and head of the chiefly Vuanirewa clan of Tubou, Lakeba and Lusiana Qolikoro from the Fonolahi Family of the Yavusa Tonga clan in Sawana. Fonolahi has lineage to the Tongan royalty and was also descended from an English missionary.

Mara&#x27;s title, &quot;Ratu&quot;, which means &quot;Chief,&quot; was hereditary; as the hereditary Paramount Chief of the Lau Islands, he held the titles of &quot;Tui Lau&quot; in 1963, and &quot;Tui Nayau kei Sau ni Vanua ko Lau&quot; in 1969. He succeeded to the &quot;Tui Nayau&quot; title in 1969, following the death of his father in 1966. He was earlier installed as &quot;Tui Lau&quot; in 1963 following the traditional consultation process between the Yavusa Tonga in Sawana, Lomaloma and the Tui Nayau his father. Though the title Tui Lau is not hereditary it has been left vacant by his cousin¹ Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna, who had died in 1958. 

&quot;Ratu&quot; Mara was first educated at Primary in Levuka (Sacred Heart Convent) than to Lau Provincial school before he left for his secondary education in an all boys boarding school in North of Tailevu (Queen Victoria School), he later moved to Marist Brothers High School Suva and Sacred Heart College, Auckland. He then attended the University of Otago in New Zealand, where he studied medicine (1942 to 1945). He never finished his medical studies, because his great-uncle and mentor, Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna (who was then regarded as Fiji&#x27;s paramount chief), seeking to groom him for future leadership of the nation, arranged for him to study history at Wadham College, Oxford in the United Kingdom. Mara was distressed to abandon his medical studies, but, dependent on Ratu Sukuna for financial support, followed his orders without question, and graduated with an MA in 1949. In 1961, he returned to the United Kingdom to pursue postgraduate study at the London School of Economics for a Diploma in Economics and Social Administration, which he was awarded in 1962. In 1973, his old alma mater, Otago University, awarded him an honorary doctorate of laws (LL.D).

Following his graduation from Oxford University, Mara returned to Fiji and had married Ro Litia Cakobau Lalabalavu Katoafutoga Tuisawau, better known as Ro Lady Lala Mara, on 9 September 1950. Her title, &quot;Ro&quot;, is also hereditary and is held by Rewan chiefs; like her husband, Ro Lala was a chief in her own right, as the &quot;Roko Tui Dreketi&quot; (Paramount Chief) of Burebasaga and Rewa. The marriage was initially opposed by some members of Mara&#x27;s family, as Ro Lala was from a rival dynasty with which the Mara clan had a history of strained relations. The marriage proved to be a happy one, however, and in stark contrast to the prevalence of divorce among many of Mara&#x27;s relatives, it lasted for more than 53 years. They had three sons and five daughters Ateca Ganilau,Koila Nailatikau Adi Asenaca kakua Mara,Finau Mara,Adi Litia Cakobau Mara Dugdale and the twins Tevita Mara and Adi Elenoa Tuilau Mara Taito two of whom have pursued political careers of their own. Their eldest son, Ratu Finau Mara, was a Cabinet Minister and parliamentary leader of the Fijian Association Party from 1996 to 1998, when he resigned to take up a diplomatic posting. Their second daughter, Adi koila Nailatikau has also followed in her father&#x27;s footsteps and has served her country as a career diplomat and politician. She was Minister for Transport and Tourism in 1999 and 2000, and served in the Fijian Senate from 2001 to 2006.

==The making of a statesman: 1950 to 1970==

After serving (from 1950) as an Administrative Officer in the Colonial Services, Mara was nominated to one of five seats on the Legislative Council reserved for ethnic Fijians in 1953. (There were ten other seats, five reserved for Indians and five for Europeans and other minorities; a further sixteen members were appointed by the colonial Governor). In 1959, Mara was appointed to the Executive Council, and in 1963 was given responsibility as Leader of Government Business and Member for Natural Resources (officially an advisor to the Governor, but in reality roughly equivalent to a modern cabinet minister). In 1964, he was received into the Great Council of Chiefs, which at that time was empowered to appoint two members to the Legislative Council. In 1966, he founded the Alliance Party, which, supported overwhelmingly by the ethnic Fijian and European communities (but not by most Indo-Fijians), won a majority of the seats in the 1966 election. In preparation for independence, the United Kingdom introduced the Westminster (Cabinet) system of government to Fiji in October 1967. The Executive Council was transformed into a modern Cabinet, and its members, who had hitherto been answerable only to the colonial Governor, were made fully responsible to the legislature. Mara was named to the new position of Chief Minister.

One problem that threatened to delay independence was the failure of ethnic Fijians and Indo-Fijians to agree on a post-independence Constitution. Ethnic Fijians, including Mara, wanted a communal franchise, with parliamentary seats reserved for the different ethnic groups, who would vote on separate electoral rolls. It was believed that this would protect indigenous Fijian rights. Mara also considered that it was in Fiji&#x27;s interests to avoid direct competition between political candidates from different ethnic groups, fearing that it would lead to social and political upheaval. Most Indo-Fijians rejected this proposal, believing that it would prevent them from obtaining a legislative majority, even though they numbered more than half of the population, and demanded that all Parliamentary seats should be elected by universal suffrage from a common voters&#x27; roll. In April 1970, Mara and Sidiq Koya, leader of the mainly Indo-Fijian National Federation Party, met in London and negotiated a compromise. Fijians and Indo-Fijians would be represented equally in the House of Representatives, with 22 seats each; a further 8 seats would be set aside for Europeans and other minorities. About half of the representatives from each ethnic group would be elected only by members of their particular race, while the other half would be elected by universal suffrage. Following this agreement, Fiji became independent on 10 October 1970.

==Prime Minister of Fiji: 1970 to 1992==

With independence, the office of Chief Minister was renamed Prime Minister, but its functions were substantially unchanged. Mara retained power in the first post-independence election of 1972. Internal divisions within the ethnic Fijian electorate led to the narrow defeat of his Alliance Party by the Indo-Fijian dominated National Federation Party (NFP) in the election of March 1977. He tendered his resignation as Prime Minister, but the NFP splintered three days later in a leadership dispute, and a constitutional crisis developed. The official representative of Queen Elizabeth, Governor-General Ratu Sir George Cakobau, ended up calling on Mara to form a new government. Although unquestionably constitutional, the Governor-General&#x27;s actions were controversial. Many Indo-Fijians were outraged at what they saw as a deliberate cynical move on his part to keep the government of Ratu Mara, his fellow-chief (and distant cousin) in power at all costs. A subsequent election to resolve the impasse in September that year, however, appeared to vindicate Cakobau, when the Alliance Party won a record 36 seats out of 52.

The Alliance Party&#x27;s majority was reduced in the 1982 election, but with 28 of the 52 seats, Mara retained power. Despite the loss of eight seats, the popular vote for the Alliance Party rose to 51.8% – an all-time record. Part of the reason for this paradox lay in the distribution of the vote: the gains in the popular vote occurred mostly because of a swing of almost 10% in the 11 &quot;communal&quot; seats reserved for, and elected exclusively by, Indo-Fijians, but 24% of the Indo-Fijian vote was insufficient to translate into parliamentary seats, and therefore did not effectively offset small but very significant losses in ethnic Fijian &quot;communal&quot; seats. It was therefore a bittersweet election for Mara.

Convinced of the need to include Indo-Fijians in the government, he proposed a &quot;government of national unity&quot; – a grand coalition with the National Federation Party. The NFP, however, rejected the offer and remained in opposition. In the election of 1987, Mara was finally defeated by a multiracial coalition led by Dr Timoci Bavadra. His retirement was to be short-lived, however. Two military coups led by Lieutenant Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka seriously undermined the social and economic stability, and the international prestige, of Fiji. Mara was recalled to head an interim administration, with a view to restoring Fiji&#x27;s international reputation and rebuilding the country&#x27;s shattered economy. In 1992, he handed over power to an elected government.

== President of the Republic: 1993 to 2000 ==

After the military coups of 1987, Fiji had severed its links with the Monarchy and become a republic, with a president and two Vice-Presidents chosen by the Great Council of Chiefs. Following his retirement as Prime Minister, Mara was elected to the Vice-Presidency in June 1992, and became Acting president soon after, when the ailing president Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau was incapacitated. He assumed the office of President officially when Ganilau died on 16 December of the following year. Modelled on the Monarchy, the presidency filled a largely honorary role, but was nevertheless vested with important reserve powers, to be used only in the event of a national crisis. 

That crisis came on 19 May 2000, with the Fiji coup of 2000. Gunmen led by George Speight forced their way into Parliament and kidnapped the Prime Minister, Mahendra Chaudhry, several Cabinet ministers, and a number of parliamentarians. Speight declared himself Prime Minister, and ordered Mara to step aside as president. Mara refused to negotiate with the plotters, and decided instead to dismiss the kidnapped government and assume emergency powers himself. His move backfired, however. In what politicians called &quot;a coup within a coup,&quot; Ratu Mara was whisked away on the naval ship Kiro on 28 May, where he was allegedly approached by a group of present and former military and police officers and ordered to suspend the Constitution. When he refused, &quot;(&quot;If the Constitution goes, I go,&quot; he defiantly declared) the group, including the army commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, former Prime Minister and 1987 Coup Leader Sitiveni Rabuka, former military commander Ratu Epeli Ganilau (a son-in-law of Mara&#x27;s), and a former Police Commissioner Isikia Savua, are alleged to have asked for, and possibly forced, Mara&#x27;s resignation. He was subsequently taken to his home island of Lakeba in the Lau Islands. For the 80-year-old president, who was seen as the father of the country and had led it, in one capacity or another, for more than 40 years, it was an anticlimactic end.

The military regime that took over appointed Ratu Josefa Iloilo, who had been Mara&#x27;s vice-president, to succeed him on 13 July 2000. After the coup had been quashed, the Supreme Court ruled on 15 November that year that Mara&#x27;s replacement was unconstitutional and ordered his reinstatement, but Mara, wishing to spare the country further constitutional trauma, officially resigned, with his resignation retroactive to 29 May 2000.

On 29 April 2001, Mara publicly accused the police chief, Colonel Isikia Savua and former Prime Minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, of instigating the coup. In what was to be his last public interview, Mara claimed that George Speight – who was then in custody and has since been convicted of treason – was only a front, Mara told Close-Up on Fiji Television that he confronted Savua and Rabuka two days after the coup about their possible involvement. &quot;I could see it in their faces,&quot;&quot; said Mara, emphatically rejecting their denials.

Mara told the programme that within half an hour of Speight&#x27;s forcible occupation of the Parliament, Rabuka had telephoned Government House (the official residence of the president) to offer to form a government.

Mara said that he was shocked to learn that the Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit of the Army had been involved in the coup. He alleged that they took George Speight to Parliament, and that their senior officers supplied them with weapons, blankets, and food. Mara also declared that the Counter Revolutionary Warfare officers who joined Speight&#x27;s coup had trained on a farm owned by Rabuka. Excerpts of this interview were broadcast on 29 April 2001; the full interview was not broadcast until 29 April 2004 – while his body was lying in state in preparation for his funeral.

Whether Mara&#x27;s resignation was in fact forced has been the subject of a police investigation since 21 May 2003, when the Police Investigations Department confirmed that they had opened an investigation into the events surrounding his departure from office. Mahendra Chaudhry, the deposed Prime Minister, has publicly supported Mara&#x27;s version of events, and has further alleged that Mara was blackmailed with a threat to kill his daughter, Tourism Minister Adi Koila Nailatikau, who was one of the hostages. Commodore Bainimarama has defended his role in the incident saying it was &quot;necessary&quot; at the time, and that Mara&#x27;s resignation was, in fact, voluntary and that he had refused offers of reinstatement. Mara&#x27;s daughter, Adi Ateca Ganilau (wife of Ratu Epeli Ganilau) appeared to support Bainimarama&#x27;s claims in a statement on 10 January 2005, saying that her father had resigned and had refused to return because he was upset by the abrogation of the Constitution. &quot;He did not agree with the abrogation of the Constitution. That was probably why he refused to return to office. It was not that the military pressured him to move out,&quot; Ganilau said. She called for a thorough investigation into the abrogation of the Constitution, and for those who were legal advisers at the time to be answerable for their actions.

Police have said they have faced &quot;many challenges&quot; in their investigation, finding many officers uncooperative. On 30 April 2004, the Fijian police said they were closely examining the recording of Mara&#x27;s last interview, in an attempt to uncover new leads. Police spokesman Mesake Koroi declared that there was a lot of hearsay and rumours in circulation that would not stand up in a court of law. &quot;Unfortunately we are hitting a brick wall in our investigations at the moment,&quot; Koroi said. On 2 May 2005, however, Commodore Bainimarama agreed to make a statement to the police about his own role in Mara&#x27;s resignation. Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes said that no charges could be brought against Commodore Bainimarama unless it could be proved that he had actually forced the president to resign. On 5 January 2006, Hughes said that Mara&#x27;s departure from the Presidency was one of seven major cases the police were still working on.

==Evaluation==

===Sugarcane industry===

Under Mara&#x27;s leadership, Fiji became a giant in sugarcane production. Between 1970 and 1987, the sugarcane crop more than doubled, from under 250,000 tonnes to 502,000. The sugar industry continues to be the mainstay of Fiji&#x27;s economy, and more than 90% of Fiji&#x27;s sugar is exported. Mara&#x27;s government led the way in negotiating special preferential marketing agreements with nations importing Fijian sugar, through the Lome Convention.

===Pine industry===

Mara also founded Fiji&#x27;s pine industry. Today, pine plantations, virtually nonexistent 40 years ago, cover close to 480 square kilometres throughout the Fiji Islands, and there is an ongoing programme to further expand area in all parts of the country. Fiji now derives more than $40 to 50 million a year in foreign exchange earnings from its forestry sector. Of this total, more than half is from pinewood chips exports. This industry now provides a substantial and increasing source of income to those in rural areas, including especially the indigenous Fijian landowners.

===International achievements and honours===

In the 1960s, Mara led a revolt by Pacific Islands delegates that brought about a restructuring of the South Pacific Commission. He also helped to launch the Pacific Islands Producers&#x27; Association and the South Pacific Forum, both associations of Pacific nations, of which Fiji was a founder member.

Yet another significant Mara achievement was his contribution to the negotiations that led to the signing of a new United Nations International Law of the Sea Convention in 1982.

On the global stage, Mara was known for his strongly pro-American views. He supported visits to Fijian ports by nuclear-armed United States warships and submarines. He was a close ally of US President Ronald Reagan. Mara was also known for his support for Taiwan. Although he did not officially recognise the Republic of China, he never hid the fact that his true sympathies lay there, and the Taipei regime, in gratitude, helped to finance the publication of his memoirs.

Over the years, Mara received many honours from around the world. In addition to his knighthood (a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE), awarded in 1969), his honours from Queen Elizabeth II included the Meritorious Service Decoration, the Officer of the Order of the British Empire (1961), Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (1983), Chancellor of the Order of Fiji, Companion of the Order of Fiji, and Knight Grand Cross of the Pian Order with Star (1995). He was also a member of the Privy Council in London beginning in 1973. Recognitions from other governments included being made a Grand Master of the Order of the National Lion in Dakar, Senegal in 1975, and the Order of Diplomatic Service Merit of South Korea in 1978. He was also a Knight of the Most Venerable Order of St John, and became Chancellor of the University of the South Pacific at Suva, which was founded with the support of his government. In 2000, &quot;Island Business&quot; Magazine named him Pacific Man of the Century, in recognition of his pivotal role in the founding of the South Pacific Forum.

===Criticisms===

There were criticisms of his leadership, too, some of which he eventually acknowledged. Many Indo-Fijians criticised him for not doing more to thwart the 1987 coups which removed an Indo-Fijian dominated administration from office, and for giving his consent to a new constitution, drafted in 1990, which guaranteed indigenous Fijian supremacy and was widely regarded as racist, even drawing comparisons from some quarters with South Africa&#x27;s apartheid system. Mara defended his role in the post-coup era of 1987 to 1992, arguing that he was doing the best he could in circumstances that he could not fully control, and that it had seemed better at the time to connive in the writing of a discriminatory constitution than to risk civil war at the hands of ethnic Fijian extremists. In 1996, he publicly apologised to the Indo-Fijian community for his role in the drafting of the 1990 Constitution. Mahendra Chaudhry, the leader of the Indo-Fijian community who in 1999 became Fiji&#x27;s first Indo-Fijian Prime Minister, said that he did not agree with, but understood, Mara&#x27;s reasons for acting as he did, and accepted his apology for having done so. Other opponents, both Indo-Fijian and ethnic Fijian, were less forgiving, however.

Sitiveni Rabuka, who led the 1987 coup, surprised many in 1999 when he claimed in an autobiography that he had carried out the coups at Mara&#x27;s behest. Mara retaliated by suing him for defamation. Mahendra Chaudhry said that he did not believe that Mara had been involved.

Not all of Mara&#x27;s critics were Indo-Fijian. George Speight, a commoner (i.e., one of non-chiefly ancestry) who led the 2000 putsch accused Mara of selling the country out to Indo-Fijians, and of working to keep power in the hands of a coalition of Fijian chiefs and Indo-Fijian businessmen, at the expense of Fijian commoners.

==Later life and death==

Following his resignation, Mara retired to his native island of Lakeba. He continued to influence politics in Fiji, where democracy was subsequently restored, through his membership of the Great Council of Chiefs, which not only advised the government but also functioned as an electoral college to choose the President of the Republic, as well as 14 of the 32 members of the Senate; at the time of his death, he was the longest-serving member of the Council. He remained Chairman of the Lau Provincial Council, a position he had held concurrently with his national offices for many years.

Mara suffered a stroke late in 2001 while visiting Port Vila, Vanuatu, with two of his longtime friends, businessmen Hari Punja and Joe Ruggiero. He died in Suva on 18 April 2004, from complications arising from the stroke. His state funeral, led by Roman Catholic Archbishop Petero Mataca, which was spread out over three days (28 to 30 April) saw an estimated 200,000 people – almost a quarter of Fiji&#x27;s total population – line the streets to pay their last respects to the man they regarded as the father of the nation, in an outpouring of public grief not seen since the death of Mara&#x27;s presidential predecessor, Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, over a decade earlier.

== Legacy ==

Even in death, Ratu Mara stirred controversy. His state funeral was by no means universally popular, even among his close supporters. Claiming to speak for many of those who had been close to the late president, Joseph Browne, who had been his official secretary, claimed that it was the &quot;height of hypocrisy&quot; to have the armed forces, still commanded by the same officers who had unceremoniously deposed Mara from the presidency four years earlier, honouring him at his funeral now.

A one-year period of mourning for the late Chief ended on 13 May 2005, with the close of a series of ceremonies that started on the 9th. Those who had been observing mourning rituals symbolically changed from black clothes into their normal attire. (Members of the Mara family, however, said that they would continue to wear black for a further three months, until the period of mourning for his wife, Adi Lala, is over). Thousands of people arrived in the chiefly village of Tubou on the island of Lakeba to take part in the &quot;vakataraisulu&quot; ritual, which lifted taboos in place for the Mara family and the people of the Lau Islands. Mara&#x27;s son, Ratu Finau Mara, who is widely expected to be named his successor as Tui Nayau, or Paramount Chief of the Lau Islands, was expected to participate in the &quot;vakataraisulu&quot; at the request of elders from Tubou and Levuka, but for undisclosed reasons, remained in Suva. In 2004, he had attended his father&#x27;s state funeral in Suva but not his private funeral in Lakeba. His younger brother, Roko Tevita Uluilakeba, was believed to be out of the country.

Addressing the Lau Provincial Council in Ratu Mara&#x27;s honour, Fiji&#x27;s current vice-president, Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi praised him as a man of vision and compassion, who hated lies and lived by the truth. He praised him as a committed Christian who practised what he preached, and who did not differentiate between people but treated all men alike whatever their race or religion. Madraiwiwi called on all Lauans to follow Mara&#x27;s example.

Another controversy was reported by the Fiji Times on 8 January 2006. His family was displeased, his daughter Adi Ateca Ganilau told the &quot;Times,&quot; that the same government that was working to release from prison persons convicted of offences related to the coup which deposed him, was also promoting an independent biography to be written by Australian academic Derrick Scarr, formerly of the Australian National University. This was contradictory, she said. &quot;On one hand they want to praise him but on the other they are working to free those people who ousted him through the Reconciliation Bill,&quot; she said, referring to controversial legislation introduced by the Fijian government in 2005, aimed at establishing a Commission empowered to propose amnesty for coup-convicts. She reiterated her previously stated opposition to the release of coup-perpetrators, saying that he father would not have stood for it if he were alive.

Jioji Kotobalavu, the chief executive officer of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department, rejected the criticism, saying that the government was not financing the book and that its involvement was limited to ensuring that Scarr had access to information sources. He considered that co-operation in the writing of the biography would be a fitting tribute to Ratu Mara, whom he called a great man. The Mara family should discuss any reservations with Scarr himself, Kotobalavu said.

== Cricket ==

Mara played two first-class matches for Fiji against Otago and Canterbury in Fiji&#x27;s 1953/54 tour of New Zealand. After scoring 44 runs against Canterbury he broke his arm, curtailing both his tour, in which he served as vice-captain, and first-class career.

In his two first-class matches Mara scored 64 runs at a batting average of 21.33, with a high score of 44. A right-arm fast-medium bowler, with the ball he took 8 wickets at a bowling average of 17.12, with best figures of 4/77.

Mara also played 8 non-first-class matches for Fiji from 1954 to 1956, with his final match for Fiji coming against the West Indies in Fiji&#x27;s famous 28 run win over them, a match in which he captained Fiji to victory.

== Personal life ==

Mara&#x27;s interests included cricket, rugby, golf, athletics, and fishing. Mara is cousins with one of Fiji&#x27;s famous cricketer&#x27;s, I.L. Bula. He was a member of the Achilles Club in London, the Defence Club in Suva, and the United Oxford and Cambridge Universities Club in the United Kingdom. Mara&#x27;s character was described as a combination of the forthright and the diplomatic, the inflexible and the dexterous, the imperious and the tolerant. He was known as a strong, imposing personality, but with an ability to forgive his opponents. A convert to Catholicism, Mara wrote of his faith: &quot;Certainly it has been the rock on which I have been able to rely in good times and in bad, and it is the lodestone of my life.&quot; He wrote an autobiography, &quot;The Pacific Way: A Memoir.&quot; Mara was survived by his wife, Adi Lala (who herself died on 20 July the same year), and by two sons and five daughters; one son predeceased him.

<text>The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) is a British child protection charity founded as the Liverpool Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (LSPCC) by Thomas Agnew on 19 April 1883. The NSPCC lobbies the government on issues relating to child welfare, and creates child abuse public awareness campaigns. Since the 1980s, the charity has had statutory powers allowing it to apply for help on behalf of children at risk. In the 1990s, the charity&#x27;s publication, &quot;Satanic Indicators&quot;, fueled panic in social workers who went and accused parents and removed children from homes when they should not have. It operates a telephone help line. The Paddington Bear character has partnered with the charity to raise funds for the charity.

==History==

=== Victorian era ===
On a trip to New York in 1881, Liverpudlian businessman Thomas Agnew was inspired by a visit to the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. On his return to Liverpool, he invited leading figures from the town to a town hall meeting and founded the Liverpool Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (LSPCC) on 19 April 1883. Similar societies were subsequently set up around the country, such as the London Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (London SPCC), founded on 8 July 1884 by Anthony Ashley-Cooper. Ashley-Cooper was the first president of the London SPCC, with Reverends Benjamin Waugh and Edward Rudolph as joint secretaries. 1st Baroness Angela Burdett-Coutts was one of the co-founder of the organisation which later became the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) in 1889 with Queen Victoria as the patron.

On 1 January 1887, the &quot;Child&#x27;s Guardian&quot;, the official magazine of the Society was launched. The magazine was modelled on the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and was designed to educate the public on the nature of cruelty to children.

After five years of campaigning by the London SPCC, Parliament passed the first ever UK law to protect children from abuse and neglect in 1889. The London SPCC was renamed the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children on 14 May 1889, because by then it had branches across Great Britain and Ireland. In the same year the Chief Commissioners of the Metropolitan and City of London Police issued instructions that all cases of cruelty to children reported to them should be handed to NSPCC to be dealt with.

The NSPCC was granted its Royal Charter on 28 May 1895 by Queen Victoria who became its first Royal Patron. It did not change its title to &quot;Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children&quot; or similar, as the name NSPCC was already well established, and to avoid confusion with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), which had already existed for more than fifty years.

=== 20th century ===
In 1901, King Edward VII and his wife Queen Alexandra became Patrons of the Society upon the death of Queen Victoria. In 1905, Reverend Benjamin Waugh retired from the Directorship of the Society, as a result of failing health, after 21 years&#x27; of service. In 1910, King George V and his wife Queen Mary became Patrons of the Society upon the death of King Edward VII.

Shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, 18 Inspectors joined the Royal Navy and a further 42 joined the Army. During the course of the war, the NSPCC inspector for Manchester was awarded the Victoria Cross. In January 1915, the NSPCC appointed its first Female Inspector. During the same War, fraudulent fundraisers were discovered to be collecting money in aid of families of those killed or injured in action. The NSPCC, therefore, avoided street collections until the War Charities Act of 1916, which introduced regulations to protect and guide collectors.

In 1919, the Prince of Wales, later to be King Edward VIII, became a Patron of the Society. In 1926 the Prince spoke on behalf of the NSPCC in a radio appeal.

In 1930, the Society reported helping its four-millionth child.

Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War the Home Secretary, Sir John Anderson, wrote to the Chairman of the Society expressing his thanks that the Society had decided to continue its work during the war. During the course of the war, the Society supported over 600,000 children, while nearly 100 of the Society&#x27;s Inspectors served in the Armed Forces.

The NSPCC&#x27;s organisation in the Republic of Ireland was taken up by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (ISPCC), founded in 1956 as a replacement for the NSPCC. Today, the NSPCC works in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and the Channel Islands.

==== 1980s ====
The NSPCC is the only UK charity which has been granted statutory powers under the Children Act 1989, allowing it to apply for care and supervision orders for children at risk. In 1983, the NSPCC launched its centenary appeal in Britain in order to &quot;establish 60 child protection teams across the country.&quot; The launch of the appeal occurred during a time when the organization was struggling because of an insufficient amount of public support and government funds. To help advertise for the NSPCC, a poster was created that highlighted the faces of two abused children, one from 1884 and the other from 1984. The message that was written along with the picture was &quot;The faces change, the bruises don&#x27;t.&quot;

==== 1990s ====
The NSPCC documented allegations of Satanic ritual abuse in 1990, with the publication of survey findings that, of 66 child protection teams in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, 14 teams had received reports of ritual abuse from children and seven of them were working directly with children who had been ritually abused, sometimes in groups of twenty. An investigation, by the British government, into SRA allegations produced over two hundred reports, of which only three were substantiated and proved to be examples of pseudosatanic abuse, in which sexual abuse was the actual motivation and the rituals were incidental.

The NSPCC also provided a publication known as &quot;Satanic Indicators&quot; to social services around the country that has been blamed for some social workers panicking and making false accusations of sexually abusing children. The most prominent of these cases was in Rochdale in 1990 when up to twenty children were taken from their homes and parents after social services believed them to be involved in satanic or occult ritual abuse. The allegations were later found to be false. The case was the subject of a BBC documentary which featured recordings of the interviews made by NSPCC social workers, revealing that flawed techniques and leading questions were used to gain evidence of abuse from the children. The documentary claimed that the social services were wrongly convinced, by organisations such as the NSPCC, that abuse was occurring and so rife that they made allegations before any evidence was considered.

In 1999, an advert released by the NSPCC &quot;warning&quot; of the risk of children being murdered by strangers was criticised as a fear-mongering fundraising tactic, as such occurrences are exceedingly uncommon.

In 2011, the NSPCC launched its All Babies Count campaign to highlight the vulnerability of babies and calling for better and earlier support for new parents. In 2012, the charity won a PRCA award for its &quot;Don&#x27;t Wait Until You&#x27;re Certain&quot; campaign that encouraged people to call the NSPCC with any worry about a child.

In November 2014, fifty Paddington Bear statues, created by various celebrities and organisations—including the NSPCC designed &quot;Patchwork Paddington&quot;—were located around London prior to the release of the film &quot;Paddington&quot;, with the statues auctioned to raise funds for the NSPCC.

In 2017, the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office fined eleven charities that breached the Data Protection Act by misusing donors’ personal data. NSPCC was fined £12,000.

In 2019, the NSPCC engaged transgender activist Munroe Bergdorf as its first LGBT+ campaigner for ChildLine. The relationship was ended controversially after what Bergdorf described as a transphobic hate campaign against her, including false allegations that she had taken part in pornographic films. The NSPCC stated that their reason was nothing to do with Bergdorf being transgender, but because she invited LGBT young people to contact her directly over social media, which was not compatible with the NSPCC&#x27;s own safeguarding policies. Over 150 NSPCC staff complained to senior management about the charity&#x27;s treatment of Bergdorf.

==Activities==
The NSPCC lobbies the government on issues relating to child welfare, and creates campaigns for the general public, with the intention of raising awareness of child protection issues. It also operates both a helpline on 0808 800 5000, for anyone concerned about a child, and Childline offering support to children themselves. Childline became a part of the NSPCC in 2006. In addition to the telephone helplines, NSPCC provides an online counselling service for children and young people at Childline.

The NSPCC runs local service centres across the UK where it helps children, young people, and families. Since 2009, the NSPCC has run a Child Protection Consultancy service aiming to make organisations safer for children. This offers training and consultancy to organisations which have contact with children, ranging from schools to sporting bodies. The charity works through local safeguarding children&#x27;s boards (LSCBs), where the police, health, social and education services and others can work together.

The charity is regularly audited and publishes its annual report and accounts as required by the Charity Commission.

In May 2021, a helpline that was launched for victims to report abuse and harassment in educational settings had taken hundreds of calls since it opened. The NSPCC received 353 calls between April 1 and May 16. Of these, 65 were referred to external agencies such as the police and children&#x27;s services.

==Research and evidence==

In 2009, the NSPCC launched a new seven year strategy. The strategy reaffirmed the society&#x27;s vision of ending cruelty to children in the UK. It was suggested that policy, influencing and campaigning work, combined with the experience of working directly with young people could help deliver this vision. Learning was to be at the core of the society&#x27;s work. The ambition was to subject all of the organisation&#x27;s direct services to an evaluation and then roll out effective interventions to mainstream service providers. In 2016 the society&#x27;s new six year strategy pledged to continue generating evidence of &#x27;what works&#x27; in preventing child sexual abuse.

In 2016, the NSPCC launched a web-based &#x27;Impact and Evidence&#x27; hub which was designed to promote and make accessible the research evidence that it produced. The hub contained sections on:

* Research and evaluation reports. 
* Information about how evaluations were carried out by the NSPCC, including information about the outcome measures used.
* A series of blog articles recounting the experiences of professionals in running research articles and producing evidence.
* Information about the organisation&#x27;s Research Ethics Committee and the process of ethical review to which research projects needed to be subject.

Research and evidence reports produced by the NSPCC include evaluations of:

* A video interaction guidance intervention with families where initial concerns about neglect have been noted.
* A therapeutic intervention for children affected by sexual abuse and their carers.
* An intervention designed to support infant mental health.
* An early intervention programme designed to enhance a mother&#x27;s relationship with her baby. 
* A parenting programme helping fathers change their behaviour after domestic abuse.
* An intervention helping mothers rebuild relationships with their children after domestic abuse.
* An intervention helping parents with drug or alcohol problems improve their parenting skills.
* An exploratory approach to working with community members to eliminate child sexual abuse.

<text>(in English, Natural Magic) is a work of popular science by Giambattista della Porta first published in Naples in 1558. Its popularity ensured it was republished in five Latin editions within ten years, with translations into Italian (1560), French, (1565) Dutch (1566) and English (1658) printed.

&quot;Natural Magic&quot; was revised and considerably expanded throughout the author&#x27;s lifetime; its twenty books (Naples 1589) include observations upon geology, optics, medicines, poisons, cooking, metallurgy, magnetism, cosmetics, perfumes, gunpowder, and invisible writing.

&quot;Natural Magic&quot; is an example of pre-Baconian science. Its sources include the ancient learning of Pliny the Elder and Theophrastus as well as numerous scientific observations made by Della Porta. 

== Author ==
Giambattista della Porta (also known as John Baptist Porta) was born in Vico Equense, Italy, between October 3rd and November 15th, 1535 and was the second of three sons. The Porta family belonged to the ancient nobility of Solerno, granting them a modest fortune until Giambattista&#x27;s father, Nardo Antonio della Porta entered the service of Emperor Charles V in 1541. This allowed the family to alternate residences between Vico Equense and Naples. The nature of Giambattista&#x27;s formal education is unknown. Only two of Giambattista&#x27;s teachers have been identified: Antonio Pisano, a royal physician in Naples, and Domenico Pizzimenti, a translator of Democritus. It is believed that he was largely self-taught with an informal education that consisted of jovial discussions of scientific and pseudoscientific topics. Giambattista began collecting &#x27;secrets of nature&#x27; when he was just fifteen. These secrets were eventually compiled and made into the twenty books of Natural Magic.

The Acadéemies of Naples were shut down in 1547 due to &#x27;political intrigue&#x27; and did not reopen until 1552, just six years before the original publication of Natural Magic. Della Porta had many friends in Naples’ most prestigious academies, and he even opened one himself sometime before 1580: Accademia dei Segreti. Academics gathered in della Porta&#x27;s home and discussed the &#x27;secrets of nature&#x27;. Later in life, della Porta became associated with Rome&#x27;s Accademia dei Lincei. He had a close relationship with its founder, Frederico Cesi and even wrote a compend of his family history. Porta&#x27;s reputation soared in the academy and he was second only to Cesi, until the enrollment of Galileo to the academy in 1611. In the same year, della Porta was entered into Oziosi in Naples, the city&#x27;s most renowned literary academy.

Natural Magic was Giambattista&#x27;s first book and the one that he is best known for. It was first published as a treatise in 1558. This treatise included four books and presented &#x27;Magiae Naturalis&#x27; as the &quot;perfection of natural philosophy and the highest science.&quot;¹ This was the basis of the twenty book edition published in 1589. It is a remarkable culmination of the credulity and curiosity of the late Renaissance, and is the basis of Giambattista&#x27;s reputation.

Della Porta did attempt to depart from the marvellous curiosities of natural magic for the study of mathematics. He was interested in optics and was a contemporary of Galileo in the development of the principles behind the telescope. In Book XVII of Natural Magic, Giambattista is the first to add a concave lens to the already invented &#x27;camera obscura&#x27;. He experimented with both convex and concave lenses in order to clarify the image of the lens and to provide a mathematical explanation for their refractive properties. Giambattista was actually theorized to have priority in the invention of the telescope, but he reveals his secondary position to Galileo in an unpublished treatise that fails to discuss anything other than his contemporary&#x27;s work.

Little is known about the marriage of Giambattista della Porta except that it produced a single daughter. Della Porta was known to have persistent ailments, often caused by anxiety. These included fevers that confined him to bed for months. Giambattista died on February 4, 1615, in Naples.

== Contents ==
In Giambattista’s preface to Natural Magic he writes, &quot;...if ever any man laboured earnestly to discover the secrets of Nature, it was I; For with all my mind and power, I have turned over the monuments of our ancestors, and if they wrote anything that was secret and concealed, that I enrolled in my catalogue of rarities.&quot; Della Porta intended to compile the secrets of nature. However, Giambattista was skeptical of the discoveries of the past and insisted on making his own through experimentation. Again in his preface he says, &quot;In our method I shall observe what our ancestors have said; then I shall show by my own experience, whether they be true or false….&quot;

Giambattista describes two different types of magic in Chapter II of Book I. The first is an evil thing having to do with spirits. He calls this sorcery. &quot;The other Magick is natural; which all excellent wise men do admit and embrace, and worship with great applause; neither is there anything more highly esteemed, or better thought of, by men of learning.&quot; This is the magic that della Porta dedicates his studies to.

<doc id="421156" wikidata="Q1052057" url="?curid=421156" title="Great crested flycatcher">
<text>The great crested flycatcher (Myiarchus crinitus) is a large insect-eating bird of the tyrant flycatcher family. It is the most widespread member of the genus &quot;Myiarchus&quot; in North America, and is found over most of the eastern and mid-western portions of the continent. It dwells mostly in the treetops and rarely is found on the ground.

==Taxonomy==
The great crested flycatcher was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the thrushes in the genus &quot;Turdus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Turdus crinitus&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;crinitus&quot; is Latin and means &quot;long-haired&quot; (from &quot;crinis&quot; meaning &quot;hair&quot;) Linnaeus based his account on the &quot;crested fly-catcher&quot; that had been described and illustrated by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his book &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as &quot;America&quot; but this was restricted to South Carolina by Outram Bangs in 1898. It is now one of 22 species placed in the genus &quot;Myiarchus&quot; that was introduced by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1844. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
Adult great crested flycatchers usually measure between in length with a wingspan of around . This bird usually weighs between . There is no sexual dimorphism. All adults are brownish on the upperparts with yellow underparts; they have a long rusty brown tail and a bushy crest. Their throat and breast are grey.

Males will sing a three-part song composed of two short whistles: a &quot;wheerreep&quot; followed by a higher-pitched &quot;whee&quot;, and a soft low &quot;churr&quot;. This song is meant to be heard by a mate at short distances, indicating periods of low disturbance and stress typically intensifying just before dawn. It is appropriately named &quot;dawn song&quot; (or twilight song).

In addition to the dawn song, great crested flycatcher also produce various calls, a series of fast ascending &quot;huit, huit, huit&quot; is given in moments of stress or excitement during interactions of between neighbours. The most characteristic sound is perhaps a single loud &quot;whee-eep&quot;, called out to communicate between mates or parents and young birds. A faster repetition of this call often signal predators in proximity to nests and young. A rapid succession of harsh-sounds rasps signals alarm or stress often heard during territorial disputes between neighbouring birds

==Distribution and habitat==
The great crested flycatcher&#x27;s habitat selection may vary slightly with different populations, but can be most often found breeding in deciduous forests and at edges of clearings and mixed woodlands. They also show a tendency to favour landscapes with open canopy, such as second growth forests or woodlands that have been subjected to selective cutting, and also appears to avoid coniferous dominant habitats such as the Canadian boreal forest.
The summer breeding ground covers all eastern, mid-eastern and parts of central United States, including Northern and Southern parts of Florida, parts of Texas, central Oklahoma, and eastern and central North Dakota. In Canada, it is limited to southern Manitoba, extreme southern portions of the St-Lawrence forest of Ontario, Quebec, northeast Nova Scotia and parts of Prince Edward Island.

Its winter range includes most of southern Mexico and the Yucatán Peninsula, and extends along the coasts of Central America. In southern peninsular Florida, Great Crested flycatcher can be found year-round. They migrate to Mexico and South America, as well as to Florida and the Caribbean.

==Behaviour==
===Food and feeding===
The great crested flycatcher is primarily an insectivore, with insects and other invertebrates making up for the majority of its diet, but will also consume small portion of small fruits and berries. Despite the &quot;flycatcher&quot; of the bird&#x27;s name, flies, along with spiders, make up only a small percentage of its diet; it prefers prey such as butterflies, moths, beetles, grasshoppers, crickets, and bees and wasps.

Great crested flycatchers will use a variety of hunting tactics, although the most common method observed is a rather passive sit-and-wait strategy. Perched in high canopies, they search in all direction often accompanied by a characteristic head bobbing. Once they have spotted a potential prey, they swoop down and will pursue if they missed on the first dive. They can also be seen abruptly braking and hovering, picking insects or small fruits off of leaves, trunks or other surfaces, sometimes crashing into the foliage in the process. Fruits and berries, when consumed are swallowed whole and the pits later regurgitated.

===Breeding===
Nest building begins as early as mid April for populations of the southern distribution, and as late as June for northern populations (i.e. Manitoba).

Great crested flycatchers are socially monogamous with chances of pairs reforming in following years, given that both members of the pair survive the winter. Pairs have been observed to attempt copulation from the beginning of nest building all the way to the hatching of young, sometimes during the nest building process; this is thought to be a strategy developed by males in order to prevent female infidelity. Mating ritual for the great crested flycatcher is described as males swooping down from a high perch in order to initiate mating with females, sometimes hovering near hideaway if female retreats, before returning to perch and repeating diving routine until mating is successful.

Although both parents will inspect potential sites, building of the nest is done almost entirely by the female, while the male closely guards its mate. Cavities that are large enough in size and opening are the preferred nesting sites, whether naturally occurring or excavated by other species (8) as well as use nesting boxes and other man-made structures. Most chosen cavities are situated between off the forest ground (11,15). The nest itself is built within 2 to 4 days and is composed mostly of vegetation and plant fibers, such as grasses, moss, leaves, but also pieces of animal fur and feathers, pieces of shed snakeskin, and artificial materials (ex: strings, tape, cloth, and plastic objects). The inner diameter ranges from 7–9 cm.

Great crested flycatchers lay a single clutch of 4-8 eggs, which are incubated on average for two weeks by the female only. After hatching, nestlings will typically spend another two weeks in the nest before fledging. During this time, nestlings are fed an insect dominated diet by both parents, although females will make more frequent visits.

<text>The Scottish Left Review is a bi-monthly magazine publication of the Scottish left. It was established in 2000 by several prominent left-wing figures, including Bob Thomson, Henry McCubbin, Jimmy Reid, Roseanna Cunningham, and John McAllion. Contributions come from members of all parties of the Scottish left and none. In 2006, it established the Scottish Left Review Press - which has published the best selling &#x27;Is there a Scottish road to socialism?&#x27; edited collection - and in 2010 it also established the Jimmy Reid Foundation.

Throughout an often difficult and challenging time for left politics in Scotland (over Tommy Sheridan, the rise of the SNP, the independence referendum and so on), the magazine has continued to hold true to its historical mission of acting as a respectful and rigorous forum for debate and discussion across the left with a view to propounding progressive politics and mapping out strategies to achieve them.

Its current editorial committee consists of Cat Boyd, academic and author Gregor Gall, Bob Thomson, Gordon Morgan, Sarah Collins, Dave Sherry, Stephen Smellie, Lilian Macer, Tommy Sheppard, Moira Craig and Bill Bonnar. The magazine was edited by Robin McAlpine from the early 2000s until mid-2014. It is now edited by Gregor Gall.

The magazine survives through a combination of pay for subscriptions for the hard copy of the magazine, advertising from unions and progressive organisation and donations from readers and supporters.

Visits to the magazine&#x27;s website run into the hundreds of thousands. For example, in January 2016, the website had 268,000 hits and 30,000 visits with a median of 5 pages read per visit. This meant readership had more than doubled in the last 3 years.

<doc id="421164" wikidata="Q1057495" url="?curid=421164" title="United National Movement">
<text>United National Movement (UNM; ) also colloquially known as the Natsebi is a liberal conservative political party in Georgia. Tina Bokuchava serves as the party&#x27;s chairman, while its honorary chairman Mikheil Saakashvili is considered the de facto leader. UNM&#x27;s electoral number is 5.

UNM was founded by Mikheil Saakashvili in 2001, in opposition to Eduard Shevardnadze&#x27;s government, rising to power following the Rose Revolution in 2003. During its nine-year rule, UNM implemented several major reforms. The government focused on rooting out corruption and crime, establishing a free market economy, pursuing a pro-Western foreign policy, and regaining territorial integrity. The latter two put it in direct conflict with Russia exploding into a full-on war in 2008 that resulted in 20% of Georgia&#x27;s territory being occupied by Russia to this day.

During its second term, accusations mounted over UNM&#x27;s alleged authoritarian tendencies with its detractors highlighting poor prison conditions, violent protest dispersals, and media and business intimidation as issues. This culminated in the Gldani prison scandal with several videos being released showing prison guards torturing, taunting, and sexually assaulting detainees. UNM subsequently lost the 2012 parliamentary election to Georgian Dream. It has since served as the main opposition party frequently criticizing the government for what it sees as its pro-Russia policies.

==History==
===Early years===
====Foundation====

Mikheil Saakashvili, the founder of United National Movement (UNM), had his start in the political party Union of Citizens of Georgia (UCG) of the president Eduard Shevardnadze. He was elected to the parliament in 1995 soon joining the team of so-called &quot;young reformers&quot; within the party led by Zurab Zhvania.

====Opposition====
By the late 90s, a rift was also growing between the &quot;young reformers&quot; and the establishment factions in CUG. The division was intensified following the 2000 presidential election. Saakashvili, who at the same time had served as the country’s justice minister, left CUG and established the opposition National Movement party, the predecessor to UNM. Zhvania, along with another prominent member of the &quot;young reformers&quot; team Nino Burjanadze also split in 2002 creating the United Democrats party.

At the same time, the government’s popularity drastically decreased being attributed to its inability to exert territorial control over the country, weak economic growth, and lack of development of public infrastructure. The 2002 local elections marked a turning point for CUG where it achieved a crushing defeat getting less than 2% in Tbilisi Sakrebulo. National Movement led by Saakashvili got a quarter of the votes in the election with him being elected the chairman of the Sakrebulo.

Despite the elections held under CUG’s rule being generally viewed as fraudulent, the scale of the fraud was described as not being enough to change the outcome of an election. This changed in 2003 parliamentary election which was widely viewed as fraudulent. Parallel voting tabulations had showed an overwhelming opposition victory despite the official results claiming otherwise. In the official results, National Movement achieved 18,74% of the vote winning 42 seats.

====Rose Revolution====
National Movement and Burjanadze-Democrats organized mass rallies in protest of the official results demanding the government either recognize the opposition&#x27;s victory or resign. Some other significant opposition forces such as Labour Party and New Rights Party chose to abstain from the protests. The opposition and the government faced off on the first session of the new parliament forcing MPs and Shevardnadze, who was delivering a speech, to leave the room. The following day, Shevardnadze made the decision to resign as president making Burjanadze, the speaker of the parliament, the new interim president. Days later, the Georgian Supreme Court declared the results as invalid. This event was later known as the Rose Revolution.

Saakashvili emerged as the clear leader from the protests, with him winning an overwhelming victory in the snap 2004 presidential election, where he ran virtually uncontested. National Movement and United Democrats later merged with them forming United National Movement. The party went on to win 66.24% in the 2004 parliamentary election.

===First term (2004-2008)===
====Government reforms====

Reforming a weak and corrupt state was a central goal of the Rose Revolution government. The salaries given out to state employees were so low, that based on the wages an employee could not theoretically survive. This led to government officials having to take bribes and engage in other corrupt practices to sustain themselves. In 2004, UNM introduced the Reform and Development Fund which raised salaries to several thousand top officials with it being funded by international donors and Georgian businesses. Salary increases were later expanded to law and military officials. This attracted a number of qualified young people to work for the government when previously they would be relegated to working abroad or for Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).

Another way UNM tried to fight corruption was through the prosecution of former major government officials for it. The officials would have to pay a large fine covering for the embezzled sums of money after which they would be let go. Most of those arrests were made in early 2004 after which the government focused on middle-level officials. This process, however, was widely criticized by international organizations, including the Council of Europe, for giving the prosecution too much arbitrary power and not following due process.

Other ways of fighting corruption included disbanding the Traffic Police, which was widely known as one of the most corrupt institutions in Georgia, and replacing it with the new Patrol Police, which enjoyed significantly more popularity. Additionally, standardized exams were introduced with them being the only way to be admitted to the Universities. The old system had been notoriously corrupt with people often being accepted based on bribes. The new system has been widely recognized as fair. In aspects where the government felt it did not have the resources to reform the corrupt institutions, it had to controversially scrap them with the likes of mandatory inspection of cars being suspended. The government further cracked down on organized crime, with it in 2005 criminalizing belonging to a criminal organization.

Another achievement of the UNM government would be its more efficient tax-collecting policy. Previously, the &quot;shadow economy&quot; accounted for 70% of the economy with the government only collecting 10% of the GDP in public revenue, the lowest in the post-Soviet states. The bigger budget allowed the government to finance spending on road repairs, repainting the façades of buildings, and the reintroduction of free medical emergency services.

UNM also implemented government reforms establishing the role of the Prime Minister and giving the President the ability to dissolve the parliament. The role of the presidency was substantially increased with the system being sometimes referred to as &quot;super-presidential&quot;. Its supporters argued that a stronger presidency was needed to more effectively push for reforms, while its critics denounced the concentration of power. Additionally, some international organizations such as the Council of Europe were critical of the reforms and pushed for the parliament to be given equal weight to the presidency.

Some progress was made in the area of democracy and human rights, although, critics highlighted systematic issues carried over from Shevardnadze’s administration. The 2004 parliamentary and presidential elections were described by OSCE-ODIHR as &quot;the most democratic since independence&quot;. In 2005, UNM passed reforms on local governance designating Rayon (district) as the singular level of local governance. However, some criticized the reforms as insufficient and as &quot;not leaving local governments enough resources to create viable institutions&quot;. The same year, UNM decriminalized defamation, making it harder to sue journalists for critical coverage. Additionally, violence against minorities was curtailed.

However, during UNM’s tenure media freedom was often criticized. In January 2005, the Council of Europe designated the country as being subject to &quot;self-censored media&quot; with it in 2006 noting that the &quot;media is financially weak and still lacks the democratic culture which would allow it to credibly perform their role of a democratic watchdog&quot;. Some additionally alleged that opposition voices were taken off the air due to government pressure. However, others saw the media legislation as being liberal and Georgian media being free to criticize the government and host its opponents. 

====Economic and social reforms====

The new government pursued economically liberal policies. Under the Shevardnadze government, Georgia already pursued free market percepts recommended by the International Monetary Fund, however, the Saakashvili administration restarted the massive privatization and accelerated all those policies. In 2004, Kakha Bendukidze, a Russian-based Georgian businessman and prominent free market advocate, was appointed by Saakashvili as a Minister of Economics. In 2004, Bendukidze notoriously said he would &quot;sell everything but Georgia’s conscience&quot; with his goal being closing down his own ministry and demolishing all economic regulation by the state.

Bendukidze implemented radical tax system reforms. Under him, a flat 12% tax rate was introduced with the overall number of taxes being reduced from 21 taxes to 6. Additionally, rapid privatization of state assets was implemented, and Georgia&#x27;s economy was opened to foreign investment and global markets with few restrictions or regulations. Supporters of Bendukidze praise the rapid economic growth and business-friendly environment that was created due to his reforms, while his detractors point out the unequal distribution of that growth among the population.

The Saakashvili administration pushed liberal social policy reforms, which put it in discord with the conservative values of the Georgian population. In 2005, the parliament took steps to take religion out of public education, passing the General Education Act, that restricted the teaching of religion in schools and the use of religious symbols in the school space for devotional purposes.

====Territorial disputes====

One of the main goals of the Rose Revolution government was restoring territorial control. Adjara, which at the time was led by the autocratic Aslan Abashidze government often defied the central Tbilisi authorities, however, unlike Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Abashidze did not desire full independence. In 2004, Abashidze was forced to flee after a series of mass public demonstrations, with Adjara returning to Tbilisi control. This was viewed as a major success for the government led by UNM.

Encouraged by the developments in Adjara, the Rose Revolution government sought to bring South Ossetia into Georgian control. Georgia and South Ossetia at the time were actively trading with each other and the people could move between the territories freely. A large part of this trade took place through the borderline Ergneti market, with it being a black market where illegal activities and smuggling had occurred. UNM believed that, as in Adjara, the crux of the problem was the defiant separatist government and that the Ossetian people would soon rise up with the help of the Georgian state to topple it. Tbilisi government closed the Ergneti market, enacted a so-called &quot;humanitarian offensive&quot; with the goal of winning over the South Ossetian people, and moved its military to the region in hopes of intimidating the Tskhinvali authorities.

The move, however, backfired with the South Ossetians growing angry at Georgia and consolidating their separatist positions. Closing the Ergneti Black Market reduced corruption, however, it also made South Ossetia economically trapped. Additionally, military skirmishes ensued resulting in the loss of life. The UNM government decided to abandon its approach recognizing it as a mistake. In January 2005, the Georgian government presented its peace plan at OSCE conference held in Ljubljana garnering Russian support, a key player in the conflict. This was viewed as a surprise considering the Georgian and Russian authorities having been at odds over the issue. Despite this minor win, the South Ossetia situation was viewed as an overall setback for the Rose Revolution government.

====2007 protests====
While Saakashvili early on enjoyed personal popularity for his youth, vigour, and international profile, allegations of human rights abuses and authoritarianism started to create an opposition movement against him. Soon UNM started to experience defections with one of the most significant ones being Irakli Okruashvili, the Defense Minister, leaving in 2007 and founding the Movement for United Georgia party. Okruashvili made accusations that the military had fallen to widespread corruption and that Saakashvili wanted to kill the opposition figure Badri Patarkatsishvili. Subsequently, this led to his arrest on extortion charges. He pled guilty, retracted the accusations, and was released on bail after which he left the country. The opposition claimed that he retracted the statements and admitted guilt based on threats and coercion.

In late 2007, The opposition subsequently organized protests with around 50,000 people gathering in front of the parliament building in Tbilisi on 2 November calling for Saakashvili&#x27;s resignation, The protests continued until November 7, when riot police were deployed to disperse the demonstration with the government enacting a 15-day nationwide state of emergency. The move received widespread criticism both locally and abroad and it was lifted the following week. Imedi TV, opposition-leaning media, was taken off air, and protestors demanded its return which took place a month later. Saakashvili called early elections, cutting his term by a year, and stepped down as president. Burjanadze, the speaker of the parliament, became the acting president.

====2008 elections====

Saakashvili was reelected in the 2008 presidential election held on 5 January narrowly winning over 50% and avoiding a second-round. 2008 parliamentary election were held on 21 May where UNM won a landslide victory getting 59.18% and once again being the single ruling party of the country. The opposition criticized the results as illegitimate with them boycotting the parliament, however, international observers largely deemed the results free and fair noting only isolated procedural violations and instances of fraud.

===Second term (2008-2012)===
====August War====
2008 saw the deterioration of relations between Russia and Georgia reaching a full diplomatic crisis by April 2008. The crisis soon evolved into a war, first between Georgia and the Russian-backed South Ossetian separatists and later directly with Russia. On 1 August 2008, the South Ossetian forces started shelling Georgian villages, with Georgia sending its army units into the conflict zone on 7 August. The Georgian army managed to quickly take control of Tskhinvali.

Russia soon falsely accused the Georgian side of committing a genocide and launched a full-scale land, air, and sea invasion of Georgia, including its undisputed territory on 8 August. Additionally, reports exist of some Russian troops illicitly crossing the Georgia–Russia border through the Roki Tunnel before the conflict broke out. Russian and separatist forces fought Georgian troops in and around South Ossetia for several days, until Georgian forces retreated. Russian and Abkhaz forces opened a second front by attacking the Kodori Gorge held by Georgia, while Russian naval forces blockaded part of the Georgian Black Sea coastline. Nicolas Sarkozy, the President of France, personally negotiated a ceasefire agreement on 12 August.

Russian forces temporarily occupied the Georgian cities of Zugdidi, Senaki, Poti and Gori. Russia recognised the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia on 26 August and the Georgian government severed diplomatic relations with Russia. Georgia additionally withdrew from Commonwealth of Independent States, a Russia dominated international organization of post-Soviet states, and called for others to do so as well. Russia mostly completed its withdrawal of troops from undisputed parts of Georgia on 8 October. The South Ossetians destroyed most ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia and were responsible for an ethnic cleansing of Georgians. The war displaced 192,000 people. While many returned to their homes after the war, 20,272 people, mostly ethnic Georgians, remained displaced as of 2014.

====Further protests and dissent====

The opposition heavily criticized Saakashvili’s handling of the war and accused him of dragging Georgia into a war it could not win. UNM suffered several defections, with Nino Burjanadze leaving the position of the speaker of the parliament and founding the opposition Democratic Movement–United Georgia party. In December 2008, the party suffered another defection with the former Prime Minister Zurab Nogaideli setting up the Movement for a Fair Georgia party. Both of the defectors criticized Saakashvili’s policies pledging a &quot;wiser approach&quot; to Russia. In April 2009, the opposition launched daily protests calling for Saakashvili’s resignation. Even though the protests died down by the end of spring, political tensions remained and the opposition held further protests towards the end of 2009. As a result of the protests, the government decided to hold early local elections in May 2010. UNM won the elections decisively getting 65.75% of the vote.

On 21 May 2011 over 10,000 people protested against Saakashvili&#x27;s government in Tbilisi and Batumi. Nino Burjanadze and her husband Badri Bitsadze emerged as the lead figures. Protesters tried to prevent a parade commemorating Georgian Independence Day. Georgian police suppressed the demonstrations with tear gas and rubber bullets. Saakashvili accused the protesters of attempting to orchestrate a government takeover using paramilitary groups.

====2012 parliamentary election====
The public discontent over Saakashvili&#x27;s presidency was high, but no opposition party managed to unite the population around its platform. This situation changed in late 2011 when Bidzina Ivanishvili, an oligarch primarily known for charity work and contributions to public projects, decided to step out of the shadow and lead the political opposition against Saakashvili by uniting the opposition and mobilizing popular support.

Ivanishvili first launched Georgian Dream in December 2011 as a movement and staged several mass demonstrations. On 21 February 2012, Ivanishvili announced the formation of a coalition of the same name, together with established political parties such as Republicans, Our Georgia – Free Democrats, and National Forum, pledging to increase welfare spending and to pursue a more pragmatic approach with Russia while maintaining a pro-Western and pro-NATO foreign policy. In subsequent months, two other opposition parties joined the coalition - the Conservative Party and Industry Will Save Georgia. Georgian Dream was transformed into a political party on 21 April 2012, being the leading party of the coalition. 

Georgian Dream held mass demonstrations around the country, with a rally held in downtown Tbilisi on 27 May 2012 having been attended by an estimated 80,000 people. Georgian Dream&#x27;s campaign surged after the Gldani prison scandal, which highlighted widespread torture in Georgian prisons under Saakashvili&#x27;s administration. In response to GD rallies that regularly attracted tens of thousands of people, the government responded by staging a rival mass event.

The six-party Georgian Dream coalition led by Ivanishvili successfully challenged UNM in the 2012 parliamentary election. It won 54.97% of the vote, while UNM received 40.34%, granting the coalition a majority of 85 seats in parliament. The remaining 65 seats went to UNM. Saakashvili conceded the loss and pledged to support the constitutional process of forming a new government, while at the same time noting his deep opposition to the coalition. This was the first democratic transfer of power in Georgia.

===First term in opposition (2012-2016)===

Soon after coming to power, the Georgian Dream coalition started persecuting UNM government officials with criminal charges ranging from embezzlement to abuse of power and torture. Former Prime Minister Vano Merabishvili, governor of Kakheti Zurab Tchiaberashvili, and Head of the Penitentiary Department Bacho Akhalaia were among the ones who were arrested. Overall more than 20,000 complaints were filed by citizens and inmates with the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office in connection to the past administration, including 4,000 cases of alleged torture or ill-treatment. In total thirty-five people were persecuted. With its reputation being tarnished, widespread calls were made by the public to ban the party altogether. The Georgian Dream coalition itself was divided over the issue with some factions supporting the move, while others such as the new chairman of parliament Davit Usupashvili preferring to persecute only specific individuals suspected of crimes.

UNM emerged as the singular opposition party in the new parliament. During this time, Georgian politics shifted towards a two-party system and was marked by a confrontation between Georgian Dream and United National Movement. This confrontation shaped the identity of the two parties, with UNM becoming a party for the people disillusioned with the Georgian Dream government, while Georgian Dream became a front for those who featured UNM&#x27;s return to power. UNM began to build its identity on being the sole party capable of challenging Georgian Dream.

In 2013 presidential election, United National Movement suffered a landslide defeat at the hands of Georgian Dream with its candidates Giorgi Margvelashvili attaining 62.12%, while the UNM candidate David Bakradze managed to only score 21.72%. Shortly after the election, Saakashvili left Georgia due to fears he would be persecuted as well. In 2014, the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office of Georgia filed criminal charges against Saakashvili. In 2018, the Tbilisi City Court sentenced him in absentia to six years in prison for ordering the beating of Valeri Gelashvili and pardoning in prior agreement the individuals tried for Sandro Girgvliani&#x27;s murder. Saakashvili continued to manage his party from abroad while accusing the Georgian government of using the legal system as a tool of political retribution.

On 5 November 2014, Free Democrats announced their withdrawal from Georgian Dream coalition which led to the government losing its majority. However, by 10 November, 12 independent majoritarian MPs, initially elected under UNM but later quitting the party following its defeat, joined the Georgian Dream coalition, which led to its number of MPs increasing to 87 in the parliament. Thus, as a result of the crisis, Georgian Dream managed to increase its representation in the parliament by four seats. Analysts saw this as unsurprising as those independent MPs were frequently voting along with the Georgian Dream coalition, despite not being official members.

Despite recruiting some new and young new and young people like Zaza Bibilashvili and Zurab Japaridze, UNM remained loyal to Saakashvili and continued to be seen as the party of the ex-president. This caused significant rifts within the party as many members thought that UNM had to break with its past to mount serious opposition to Georgian Dream. New Political Center — Girchi, led by Japaridze, was the first to break with the party doing so in May 2015, followed by New Georgia, led by Giorgi Vashadze, in May 2016. Both of the parties later joined State for the People bloc for the 2016 parliamentary election.

===Second term in opposition (2016-2020)===
====European Georgia split====

Soon after the election, where UNM received 27.11% of the proportional vote, it experienced a major party split on 12 January 2017, as a result of a conflict between Davit Bakradze, Giga Bokeria, former mayor of Tbilisi Gigi Ugulava along with their supporters, and members of the party loyal to Saakashvili. Saakashvili had rejected the party&#x27;s decision to enter parliament after the 2016 election, calling for a boycott, and had further opposed the initiative of party members to appoint a new chairman in his place. A majority of the UNM&#x27;s elected MPs (21 out of 27) defected to European Georgia (EG), leaving UNM with only six MPs in the parliament. In the 2017 local elections, UNM saw a reduction in its vote share, falling to 17.08%, however, it remained the largest opposition party. The party was heavily affected by the formation of EG, which garnered 10.4% of the vote.

====2018 presidential election====
Ahead of the 2018 presidential election, UNM formed the Strength is in Unity coalition with it nominating Grigol Vashadze as the joint presidential candidate. The alliance included UNM as well as nine other parties including For a New Georgia, Serve Georgia, the National Democratic Party, State for the People, the Christian Conservative Party, the Civil Alliance for Freedom, New Georgia, Georgia Among Leaders, and the European Democrats.

The presidential election was seen as an opportunity for UNM to achieve its first victory since its loss of power. It was nearly successful in defeating the Georgian Dream-backed independent candidate Salome Zourabichvili in the first round with Vashadze getting 37.74% of the vote compared to Zourabichvili&#x27;s 40.48%. After a stronger-than-expected performance from the opposition, Ivanishvili put together a scheme in which the debts of 600,000 Georgians would be written off and covered by his charity, in an attempt to secure Zourabichvili&#x27;s victory. It was considered &quot;an unprecedented case of vote-bribing&quot;. The government supported scheme was enough to boost Georgian Dream&#x27;s popularity and give Zourabichvili a victory in the second round. On 24 March 2019, Saakashvili stepped down as the party chairman, with him being succeeded by Vashadze. Nevertheless, Saakashvili remained the most influential figure in the party.

====Gavrilov&#x27;s Night====
The summer of 2019 set off a prolonged period of political unrest and civil discontent with Georgian Dream&#x27;s rule. On 20 June 2019, Parliament of Georgia hosted the Interparliamentary Assembly on Orthodoxy, an organization set up by the Greek parliament to unite Orthodox Christian lawmakers worldwide. With both Russia and Georgia being members of the organization, the Russian delegation arrived to take part in the session in the Georgian parliament. The session was opened with a speech from Sergei Gavrilov, a Russian lawmaker from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, whilst sitting in the chair of the Head of Parliament.

The opposition said it was a denigration of Georgian sovereignty and completely unacceptable that Gavrilov presided over a session in Georgian parliament, as a representative of the occupying power with a history of casting anti-Georgia votes. The opposition, including UNM, called for protests in front of the parliament building. That same day, a large protest took place in front of Parliament, which was violently dispersed by the orders of Interior Minister Giorgi Gakharia. It became known as Gavrilov&#x27;s Night. Georgian Dream leader Ivanishvili said the protest was legitimate, but the situation was exploited by the opposition parties to storm the parliament building, thus the police measures were necessary to prevent a coup. The protests continued for months, demanding electoral reforms, snap elections, and resignations from the ruling party. Despite some concessions from Georgian Dream, such as the resignation of the chairman of parliament and the partial electoral amendments, the protests did not stop.

====2020 parliamentary election====
By March 2020, Strength is in Unity coalition had seen an exodus of parties with only five remaining: UNM, New Georgia, Law and Justice, the European Democrats, and the Christian Conservative Party. The alliance experienced its largest setback in July 2020 after the group rejected the prime ministerial candidacy of Giorgi Vashadze. Vashadze&#x27;s New Georgia and Tako Charkviani&#x27;s Law and Justice both left to form their own electoral bloc, Strategy Aghmashenebeli.

The Strength is in Unity bloc continuously polled higher than any other opposition group and other parties sought a certain level of cooperation to avoid competition. In August, 30 opposition parties, including the SU members, signed an agreement to field joint candidates in the various majoritarian districts of Tbilisi, although SU would break the agreement by nominating Khatia Dekanoidze to run in the Isani Majoritarian District, where other parties had already nominated Giorgi Vashadze. Meanwhile, SU&#x27;s other nominees in Tbilisi (Nika Melia in Gldani and Levan Khabeishvili in Samgori) were endorsed by the 30-party group.

On September 7, Strength Is in Unity nominated former President Mikheil Saakashvili as its nominee for Prime Minister of Georgia, a controversial choice as the UNM leader was at the time in exile in Ukraine and had been convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; by Georgian courts in 2018. Nonetheless, five political parties (UNM, Progress and Freedom, State for the People, the Republican Party, and European Democrats) came together on September 15 and signed an agreement to formally recreate the SU coalition. The coalition&#x27;s electoral list was led by singer Vakhtang Kikabidze. Out of 30 majoritarian districts, four SU nominees were members of Progress and Freedom, while the other 26 were members of UNM.

===Third term in opposition (2020-2024)===
====Post-election political crisis====

Strength is in Unity won 27.1% in the parliamentary election, winning 36 seats in the national legislature and finishing second, behind Georgian Dream. In 2020 Adjaran legislative election, which was held simultaneously, it won 34% and was the only opposition group to win seats in the autonomous republic&#x27;s legislature. However, SU joined other political parties in refusing to recognize the electoral results after allegations of voter fraud surfaced, boycotting majoritarian runoffs and entering either the parliament or the Supreme Council of Adjara. However, one of its elected members in Adjara from the Republican Party broke the boycott and entered the Supreme Council on December 25.

In the aftermath of the election and the ensuing political crisis, the SU backed negotiations with Georgian Dream facilitated by the Western countries. While SU MPs formally renounced their mandates, Parliament formally rejected their suspension on February 2, which allowed for negotiations to continue. The crisis worsened when authorities arrested UNM chairman and the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the coalition Nika Melia on February 28. On March 1, 2021, EU Council President Charles Michel launched new negotiations between Georgian Dream and the opposition to put an end to the political crisis with SU being represented by Salome Samadashvili and Akaki Minashvili from UNM and Khatuna Samnidze from the Republican Party. The sides reached an agreement on April 19, although SU refused to sign the deal. This refusal proved to be controversial in the coalition with it leading to the Republican Party leaving Strength is in Unity, along with Grigol Vashadze and Salome Samadashvili, who each signed the agreement independently. Because of UNM not signing the 19 April agreement, Georgian Dream pulled out of it citing its failure &quot;to accomplish its goals&quot;.

====2021 local elections====

On 1 October, on the eve of the first round of 2021 local elections, Mikheil Saakashvili announced his return from self-imposed exile. Saakashvili went live on Facebook and called on his followers to march on the capital, Tbilisi. Some government officials initially denied Saakashvili&#x27;s arrival and said he was in Ukraine. However, the same day, Prime Minister of Georgia Irakli Garibashvili held a press briefing, announcing that Saakashvili was arrested in Tbilisi. According to the investigation, Saakashvili entered the country secretly, hiding in a semi-trailer truck loaded with milk products. He illegally crossed the state border of Georgia, bypassing the customs control.

In the first round of the election, UNM received 30.67% of the nationwide vote, with Melia, UNM&#x27;s candidate for Tbilisi mayoral election getting 34.01%. On October 14, tens of thousands of Georgians rallied in Tbilisi to demand Saakashvili&#x27;s release. In the second round of the vote, Melia received 44.39%, losing the runoff to the incumbent Kakha Kaladze. Melia however improved on the margin he got in 2014, where he also ran as UNM&#x27;s candidate for Tbilisi mayor, getting only 27.53% in the runoff.

====2024 parliamentary election====
On 2 February 2022, UNM sent a delegation to Ukraine to show solidarity amid the threat of an impending Russian invasion. Additionally, on the one year anniversary of the invasion members of the UNM party were among the delegation that went to Ukraine to express solidarity with the country. UNM supported protests held in June 2022 calling for the resignation of Garibashvili as PM and the formation of an interim technocratic government citing the government’s failure to get EU candidate status.

In January 2023, Levan Khabeishvili was elected as Chairman of UNM, defeating his predecessor Nika Melia. The party supported the Russian law protests in 2023, and then once again in 2024. The government was widely condemned for the use of excessive and disproportionate force when dispersing protests. Riot police has been accused of consistent use of violence and torture against protestors as well as opposition political figures, including against UNM Chair Levan Khabeishvili. Due to his injuries, Khabeishvili decided to resign with Tina Bokuchava taking over as the party chair. Even though law enforcement has claimed to have opened a case into the claims of the use of excessive force, no police officer has been charged yet. Additionally, the government has been accused of conducting an &quot;Intimidation Campaign&quot; against the opposition. UNM politicians have received threatening calls and their party offices have been vandalized. Their central headquarters in Tbilisi was attacked with large spears on 1 June.

Since 2021, Strength is in Unity has existed only as a parliamentary faction. On 20 July 2023, the remaining SU members and Strategy Aghmashenebeli announced the formation of a political coalition titled Victory Platform. The alliance was later renamed to Unity - To Save Georgia (which was itself altered to Unity – National Movement). On 17 August, European Georgia joined the coalition. The parties in the coalition are signatories to the Georgian Charter initiated by the president Zourabichvili that sets out goals for a possible future government.

== Ideology ==
UNM started out as a centre to centre-left party, however, after coming to power following the Rose Revolution it moved to the right. Since then, it has generally been described as a centre-right or a centre-right to right-wing party. However, in the later years some studies see the party as moving in an increasingly socially liberal and economically centrist direction. It is generally labeled a liberal, neoliberal, or liberal conservative party. It is sometimes characterized as being a liberal-right by some analysts due to the party&#x27;s liberal social and fiscal views. Due to the party&#x27;s neoliberal economic reforms and autocratic tendencies while in government its ideology has additionally been dubbed &quot;neoliberal authoritarianism&quot;. Populism is additionally attributed to the party. UNM has further been described as adhering to moderate or civic nationalism. The party is viewed as being pro-Western with a pro-European, pro-NATO, and anti-Russian foreign policy.

===Fiscal policy===
UNM’s fiscal policy is generally viewed as being right-wing and libertarian, however, over the years it has moved closer to the centre. Nevertheless, the party generally supports welfare retrenchment. It advocates for the liberalization of the national economy as well as the reduction of taxes, the public debt, and the deficit. The party supports establishing a mixed healthcare system. Saakashvili administration has been labelled “the freest market government” in the world engaging in mass privatization and deregulation. The party has been described as drawing influence from the theories of Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, and policies of Margaret Thatcher in the UK and Ronald Reagan in the US.

===Social policy===
UNM has liberal social values. It supports the strengthening of LGBT rights, legalization of soft drugs, allowing the sell of land to foreigners, and abolishing mandatory military service. The party, however, does not support green politics and the right of ethnic minorities to receive state services in their own language.

===Foreign policy===

The UNM&#x27;s foreign policy platform is strongly pro-Western and puts an emphasis on Euro-Atlantic integration. Saakashvili has aimed to align Georgia with the Western world considering it being &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;civilized&quot; as opposed to the Soviet &quot;backwardness&quot;. Saakashvili has positioned himself as a radical Westernizer.

Nowadays, the party is strongly anti-Russian, however, during its first years in government, the party tried to reconcile with Russia over the topics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, with Saakashvili visiting Vladimir Putin in Moscow numerous times to hold negotiations. Its stance changed drastically since the 2008 invasion when Russia was identified as the number one threat to Georgian national security. The party deems Russian actions against Georgia as imperialist attempts to preserve its sphere of influence in the South Caucasus, blocking Georgian integration into the EU and NATO. Based on the close relationship with the United States, Mikheil Saakashvili elaborated his vision of turning Georgia into the &quot;Israel of the Caucasus&quot;. Based on this concept, Saakashvili developed close ties with Israel under US auspices.
