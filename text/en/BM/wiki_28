<text>Viscount Hailsham, of Hailsham in the County of Sussex, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1929 for the lawyer and Conservative politician Douglas Hogg, 1st Baron Hailsham, who twice served as Lord High Chancellor of the Great Britain. He had already been created Baron Hailsham, of Hailsham in the County of Sussex, in 1928, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Hogg was the son of the merchant and philanthropist Quintin Hogg, seventh son of Sir James Hogg, 1st Baronet, whose eldest son James McGarel-Hogg, 2nd Baronet was created Baron Magheramorne in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1887.

He was succeeded by his son, Quintin Hogg, who became the second Viscount, who was also a prominent lawyer and Conservative politician. On 20 November 1963 he disclaimed his peerages under the Peerage Act 1963, so that he could be elected to the House of Commons. However, in 1970 he accepted a life peerage as Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone, of Herstmonceux in the County of Sussex, and returned to the House of Lords, and like his father served twice as Lord Chancellor of the United Kingdom. The first and second Viscounts Hailsham are the only father and son ever to both serve as Lord Chancellor.

On his death in 2001, he was succeeded in the hereditary barony and viscountcy by his son, the third Viscount. Like his father and grandfather he is a lawyer and Conservative politician and was a Member of Parliament from 1979 to 2010. The House of Lords Act 1999 had by the time of his father&#x27;s death removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords and he did not need to disclaim his peerages to remain a member of the House of Commons. Viscount Hailsham was given a life peerage in 2015 as Baron Hailsham of Kettlethorpe, of Kettlethorpe in the County of Lincolnshire. This enabled him to sit in the House of Lords. His wife Sarah Hogg, Baroness Hogg, a life peeress in her own right, is also a member of the House of Lords.

The family seat is Kettlethorpe Hall, near Kettlethorpe, Lincolnshire. The 1st Viscount, 2nd Viscount and other members of the family are buried in the churchyard at All Saints, Herstmonceux, Sussex.

==Viscounts Hailsham (1929)==
*Douglas McGarel Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham (1872–1950)
*Quintin McGarel Hogg, 2nd Viscount Hailsham (1907–2001) (disclaimed 1963) (created Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone 1970)
*Douglas Martin Hogg, 3rd Viscount Hailsham (b. 1945) (created Baron Hailsham of Kettlethorpe in 2015)

The heir apparent is the present holder&#x27;s son, the Hon. Quintin John Neil Martin Hogg (b. 1973).

<doc id="414958" wikidata="Q192694" url="?curid=414958" title="Paleobotany">
<text>Paleobotany, also spelled as palaeobotany, is the branch of botany dealing with the recovery and identification of plant remains from geological contexts, and their use for the biological reconstruction of past environments (paleogeography), and the evolutionary history of plants, with a bearing upon the evolution of life in general. A synonym is paleophytology. It is a component of paleontology and paleobiology. The prefix &quot;palaeo-&quot; or &quot;paleo-&quot; means &quot;ancient, old&quot;, and is derived from the Greek adjective , . Paleobotany includes the study of terrestrial plant fossils, as well as the study of prehistoric marine photoautotrophs, such as photosynthetic algae, seaweeds or kelp. A closely related field is palynology, which is the study of fossilized and extant spores and pollen.

Paleobotany is important in the reconstruction of ancient ecological systems and climate, known as paleoecology and paleoclimatology respectively. It is fundamental to the study of green plant development and evolution. Paleobotany is a historical science much like its adjacent, paleontology. Because of the understanding that paleobotany gives to archeologists, it has become important to the field of archaeology as a whole. primarily for the use of phytoliths in relative dating and in paleoethnobotany.

The study and discipline of paleobotany was seen as far back as the 19th century. Known as the “Father of Paleobotany”, French botanist Adolphe-Theodore Brongniart was a sufficient figure in this emergence of Paleobotany, known for his work on the relationship between the living and extinct plant life. This work not only progressed paleobotany but also the understanding of the earth and its longevity in actuality and the organic matter that existed over the earth’s timeline. Paleobotany also succeeded in the hands of German paleontologist Ernst Friedrich von Schlothiem, and Czech nobleman and scholar, Kaspar Maria von Sternberg.

== Related Sciences ==

=== Paleoecology ===
As paleobotany is the specification of fossilized plant life and the environment in which they thrived in, paleoecology is the study of all once-living organisms and the interactions held in the environments they once existed in, before becoming extinct.

Paleoecology is a similar study to that of paleontology, but paleoecology uses more methodology from the biological sciences and geological sciences rather than from an anthropological standpoint as paleontologists do. 

=== Paleopalynology ===
Paleopalynology, more commonly known as palynology, is the science and study of ancient palynomorphs: particles sized between 5 and 500 micrometers. This would be an inclusion of pollen and spores and any other micro-organic matter. Paleopalynology is simply paleobotany on a much smaller scale, the two in close association with each other. 

Similar to paleobotany, we can tell a great deal of information about the environment and biome at the time these particles existed prehistorically. These particles also help geologists identify and date the rock strata of sedimentary rocks. It is also used to find natural oils and gas within these rock layers for extraction. Besides uncovering documentation of our past environmental conditions, palynology can also tell us about animal diets, historical standings of human allergies, and reveal evidence in crime cases.

==Overview of the paleobotanical record==
Macroscopic remains of true vascular plants are first found in the fossil record during the Silurian Period of the Paleozoic era. Some dispersed, fragmentary fossils of disputed affinity, primarily spores and cuticles, have been found in rocks from the Ordovician Period in Oman, and are thought to derive from liverwort- or moss-grade fossil plants.

An important early land plant fossil locality is the Rhynie chert, found outside the village of Rhynie in Scotland. The Rhynie chert is an Early Devonian sinter (hot spring) deposit composed primarily of silica. It is exceptional due to its preservation of several different clades of plants, from mosses and lycophytes to more unusual, problematic forms. Many fossil animals, including arthropods and arachnids, are also found in the Rhynie chert, and it offers a unique window into the history of early terrestrial life.

Plant-derived macrofossils become abundant in the Late Devonian including tree trunks, fronds, and roots. The earliest tree was once thought to be &quot;Archaeopteris&quot;, which bears simple, fern-like leaves spirally arranged on branches atop a conifer-like trunk, although it is now known to be the recently discovered &quot;Wattieza&quot;.

Widespread coal swamp deposits across North America and Europe during the Carboniferous Period contain a wealth of fossils containing arborescent lycopods up to 30 m tall, abundant seed plants, such as conifers and seed ferns, and countless smaller, herbaceous plants.

Angiosperms (flowering plants) evolved during the Mesozoic, and flowering plant pollen and leaves first appeared during the Early Cretaceous, approximately 130 million years ago.

==Plant fossils==

A plant fossil is any preserved part of a plant that has long since died. Such fossils may be prehistoric impressions that are many millions of years old, or bits of charcoal that are only a few hundred years old. Prehistoric plants are various groups of plants that lived before recorded history (before about 3500 BC).

===Preservation of plant fossils===

Plant fossils can be preserved in a variety of ways, each of which can give different types of information about the original parent plant. These modes of preservation may be summarised in a paleobotanical context as follows.
#Adpressions (compressions – impressions). These are the most commonly found type of plant fossil. They provide good morphological detail, especially of dorsiventral (flattened) plant parts such as leaves. If the cuticle is preserved, they can also yield fine anatomical detail of the epidermis. Little other detail of cellular anatomy is normally preserved. 
#Petrifactions (permineralisations or anatomically preserved fossils). These provide fine detail of the cell anatomy of the plant tissue. Morphological detail can also be determined by serial sectioning, but this is both time consuming and difficult.
#Moulds and casts. These only tend to preserve the more robust plant parts such as seeds or woody stems. They can provide information about the three-dimensional form of the plant, and in the case of casts of tree stumps can provide evidence of the density of the original vegetation. However, they rarely preserve any fine morphological detail or cell anatomy. A subset of such fossils are pith casts, where the centre of a stem is either hollow or has delicate pith. After death, sediment enters and forms a cast of the central cavity of the stem. The best known examples of pith casts are in the Carboniferous Sphenophyta (&quot;Calamites&quot;) and cordaites (&quot;Artisia&quot;). 
#Authigenic mineralisations. These can provide very fine, three-dimensional morphological detail, and have proved especially important in the study of reproductive structures that can be severely distorted in adpressions. However, as they are formed in mineral nodules, such fossils can rarely be of large size.
#Fusain. Fire normally destroys plant tissue but sometimes charcoalified remains can preserve fine morphological detail that is lost in other modes of preservation; some of the best evidence of early flowers has been preserved in fusain. Fusain fossils are delicate and often small, but because of their buoyancy can often drift for long distances and can thus provide evidence of vegetation away from areas of sedimentation.

===Fossil-taxa===

Plant fossils almost always represent disarticulated parts of plants; even small herbaceous plants are rarely preserved whole. The few examples of plant fossils that appear to be the remains of whole plants are in fact incomplete as the internal cellular tissue and fine micromorphological detail is normally lost during fossilization. Plant remains can be preserved in a variety of ways, each revealing different features of the original parent plant.

Because of this, paleobotanists usually assign different taxonomic names to different parts of the plant in different modes of preservation. For instance, in the subarborescent Palaeozoic sphenophytes, an impression of a leaf might be assigned to the genus &quot;Annularia&quot;, a compression of a cone assigned to &quot;Palaeostachya&quot;, and the stem assigned to either &quot;Calamites&quot; or &quot;Arthroxylon&quot; depending on whether it is preserved as a cast or a petrifaction. All of these fossils may have originated from the same parent plant but they are each given their own taxonomic name. This approach to naming plant fossils originated with the work of Adolphe-Théodore Brongniart.

For many years this approach to naming plant fossils was accepted by paleobotanists but not formalised within the &quot;International Rules of Botanical Nomenclature&quot;. Eventually, and proposed a set of formal provisions, the essence of which was introduced into the 1952 International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. These early provisions allowed fossils representing particular parts of plants in a particular state of preservation to be placed in organ-genera. In addition, a small subset of organ-genera, to be known as form-genera, were recognised based on the artificial taxa introduced by Brongniart mainly for foliage fossils. The concepts and regulations surrounding organ- and form-genera were modified within successive codes of nomenclature, reflecting a failure of the paleobotanical community to agree on how this aspect of plant taxonomic nomenclature should work (a history reviewed by Cleal and Thomas in 2020). The use of organ- and fossil-genera was abandoned with the &quot;St Louis Code&quot;, and replaced by &quot;morphotaxa&quot;.

The situation in the &quot;Vienna Code&quot; of 2005 was that any plant taxon whose type is a fossil, except diatoms, can be described as a morphotaxon, a particular part of a plant preserved in a particular way. Although the name is always fixed to the type specimen, the circumscription (i.e. range of specimens that may be included within the taxon) is defined by the taxonomist who uses the name. Such a change in circumscription could result in an expansion of the range of plant parts or preservation states that could be incorporated within the taxon. For instance, a fossil-genus originally based on compressions of ovules could be used to include the multi-ovulate cupules within which the ovules were originally borne. A complication can arise if, in this case, there was an already named fossil-genus for these cupules. If paleobotanists were confident that the type of the ovule fossil-genus and of the cupule fossil-genus could be included in the same genus, then the two names would compete as to being the correct one for the newly emended genus. In general, there would be competing priority whenever plant parts that had been given different names were discovered to belong to the same species. It appeared that morphotaxa offered no real advantage to paleobotanists over normal fossil-taxa and the concept was abandoned with the 2011 botanical congress and the 2012 International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants.

==Fossil groups of plants==


Some plants have remained almost unchanged throughout earth&#x27;s geological time scale. Horsetails had evolved by the Late Devonian, early ferns had evolved by the Mississippian, conifers by the Pennsylvanian. Some plants of prehistory are the same ones around today and are thus living fossils, such as &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; and &quot;Sciadopitys verticillata&quot;. Other plants have changed radically, or became extinct.

Examples of prehistoric plants are:
*&quot;Araucaria mirabilis&quot;
*&quot;Archaeopteris&quot;
*&quot;Calamites&quot;
*&quot;Dillhoffia&quot;
*&quot;Glossopteris&quot;
*&quot;Hymenaea protera&quot;
*&quot;Nelumbo aureavallis&quot;
*&quot;Pachypteris&quot;
*&quot;Palaeoraphe&quot;
*&quot;Peltandra primaeva&quot;
*&quot;Protosalvinia&quot;
*&quot;Trochodendron nastae&quot;

<text>In medicine, a stent is a tube usually constructed of a metallic alloy or a polymer. It is inserted into the lumen (hollow space) of an anatomic vessel or duct to keep the passageway open. 

Stenting refers to the placement of a stent. The word &quot;stent&quot; is also used as a verb to describe the placement of such a device, particularly when a disease such as atherosclerosis has pathologically narrowed a structure such as an artery.

A stent is different from a shunt. A shunt is a tube that connects two previously unconnected parts of the body to allow fluid to flow between them. Stents and shunts can be made of similar materials, but perform two different tasks.

There are various types of stents used for different medical purposes. Coronary stents are commonly used in coronary angioplasty, with drug-eluting stents being the most common type. Vascular stents are used for peripheral and cerebrovascular disease, while ureteral stents ensure the patency of a ureter. 

Prostatic stents can be temporary or permanent and are used to treat conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia. Colon and esophageal stents are palliative treatments for advanced colon and esophageal cancer. Pancreatic and biliary stents provide drainage from the gallbladder, pancreas, and bile ducts to the duodenum in conditions such as obstructing gallstones. There are also different types of bare-metal, drug-eluting, and bioresorbable stents available based on their properties. 

The term &quot;stent&quot; originates from Charles Stent, an English dentist who made advances in denture-making techniques in the 19th century. The use of coronary stents began in 1986 by Jacques Puel and Ulrich Sigwart to prevent vessel closure during coronary surgery.

==Stent types==
===By destination organ===
====Coronary stent====
Coronary stents are placed during a coronary angioplasty. The most common use for coronary stents is in the coronary arteries, into which a bare-metal stent, a drug-eluting stent, a bioabsorbable stent, a dual-therapy stent (combination of both drug and bioengineered stent), or occasionally a covered stent is inserted.
The majority of coronary stents used today are drug-eluting stents, which release medication to prevent complications such as blood clot formation and restenosis (re-narrowing). Stenting is performed through a procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), where the cardiologist uses angiography and intravascular ultrasound to assess the blockage in the artery and determine the appropriate size and type of stent. The procedure is typically done in a catheterization clinic, and patients may need to stay overnight for observation. While stenting has been shown to reduce chest pain (angina) and improve survival rates after a heart attack, its effectiveness in stable angina patients has been debated. 

Studies have found that most heart attacks occur due to plaque rupture rather than an obstructed artery that would benefit from a stent. Statins, along with PCI/stenting and anticoagulant therapies, are considered part of a broader treatment strategy. Some cardiologists believe that coronary stents are overused, but there is evidence of under-use in certain patient groups like the elderly. Ongoing research continues to explore new types of stents with biocompatible coatings or absorbable materials.

====Vascular stent====

Vascular stents are a common treatment for advanced peripheral and cerebrovascular disease. Common sites treated with vascular stents include the carotid, iliac, and femoral arteries. Because of the external compression and mechanical forces subjected to these locations, flexible stent materials such as nitinol are used in many peripheral stents. 

Vascular stents made of metals can lead to thrombosis at the site of treatment or to inflammation scarring. Drug-eluting stents with pharmacologic agents or as drug delivery vehicles have been developed as an alternative to decrease the chances of restenosis.

Because vascular stents are designed to expand inside a blocked artery to keep it open, allowing blood to flow freely, the mechanical properties of vascular stents are crucial for their function: they need to be highly elastic to allow for the expansion and contraction of the stent within the blood vessel, they also need to have high strength and fatigue resistance to withstand the constant physiological load of the arteries, they should have good biocompatibility to reduce the risk of thrombosis and vascular restenosis, and to minimize the body&#x27;s rejection of the implant.

Vascular stents are commonly used in angioplasty, a surgical procedure that opens blocked arteries and places a stent to keep the artery open. This is a common treatment for heart attacks and is also used in the prevention and treatment of strokes. Over 2 million people receive a stent each year for coronary artery disease alone. Vascular stents can also be used to prevent the rupture of aneurysms in the brain, aorta, or other blood vessels.

====Ureteric stent====
Ureteral stents are used to ensure the patency of a ureter, which may be compromised, for example, by a kidney stone. This method is sometimes used as a temporary measure to prevent damage to a kidney caused by a kidney stone until a procedure to remove the stone can be performed. 

An ureteral stent it is typically inserted using a cystoscope, and one or both ends of the stent may be coiled to prevent movement. Ureteral stents are used for various purposes, such as temporary measures to prevent damage to a blocked kidney until a stone removal procedure can be performed, providing drainage for compressed ureters caused by tumors, and preventing spasms and collapse of the ureter after trauma during procedures like stone removal. The thread attached to some stents may cause irritation but allows for easy removal by pulling gently. 

Stents without threads require cystoscopy for removal. Recent developments have introduced magnetic retrieval systems that eliminate the need for invasive procedures like cystoscopy when removing the stent. The use of magnets enables simple extraction without anesthesia and can be done by primary care physicians or nurses rather than urologists. This method has shown high success rates across different patient groups including adults, children, and kidney transplant patients while reducing costs associated with operating room procedures.

====Prostatic stent====
Prostatic stents are placed from the bladder through the prostatic and penile urethra to allow drainage of the bladder through the penis. This is sometimes required in benign prostatic hyperplasia.

A prostatic stent is used to keep the male urethra open and allow for the passage of urine in cases of prostatic obstruction and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). There are two types of prostatic stents: temporary and permanent. Permanent stents, typically made of metal coils, are inserted into the urethra to apply constant gentle pressure and hold open sections that obstruct urine flow. They can be placed under anesthesia as an outpatient procedure but have disadvantages such as increased urination, limited incontinence, potential displacement or infection, and limitations on subsequent endoscopic surgical options. On the other hand, temporary stents can be easily inserted with topical anesthesia similar to a Foley catheter, and allow patients to retain volitional voiding. However, they may cause discomfort or increased urinary frequency.

In the US, there is one temporary prostatic stent that has received FDA approval called The Spanner. It maintains urine flow while allowing natural voluntary urination. Research on permanent stents often focuses on metal coil designs that expand radially to hold open obstructed areas of the urethra. 

These permanent stents are used for conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), recurrent bulbar urethral stricture (RBUS), or detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia (DESD). The Urolume is currently the only FDA-approved permanent prostatic stent.

==== Colon and Esophageal stents ====
Colon and esophageal stents are a palliative treatment for advanced colon and esophageal cancer.

A colon stent is typically made of flexible metal mesh that can expand and hold open the blocked area, allowing for the passage of stool. Colon stents are used primarily as a palliative treatment for patients with advanced colorectal cancer who are not candidates for surgery. They help relieve symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation, and bowel obstruction caused by tumors or strictures in the colon.

The placement of a colon stent involves endoscopic techniques similar to esophageal stenting. A thin tube called an endoscope is inserted into the rectum and guided through the colon to locate the blockage. Using fluoroscopy or endoscopic guidance, a guidewire is passed through the narrowed area and then removed after positioning it properly. The stent is then delivered over the guidewire and expanded to keep open the obstructed section of the colon. Complications associated with colon stents include perforation of the intestinal wall, migration or dislodgment of the stent, bleeding, infection at insertion site, or tissue overgrowth around it.

Colon stenting provides several benefits including prompt relief from bowel obstruction symptoms without invasive surgery in many cases. It allows for faster recovery time compared to surgical interventions while providing palliative care for patients with advanced colorectal cancer by improving quality of life and enabling better nutritional intake. However, there are potential risks associated with complications such as migration or obstruction that may require additional procedures or interventions to address these issues effectively.

==== Pancreatic and biliary stents ====

Pancreatic and biliary stents provide pancreatic and bile drainage from the gallbladder, pancreas, and bile ducts to the duodenum in conditions such as ascending cholangitis due to obstructing gallstones.

Pancreatic and biliary stents can also be used to treat biliary/pancreatic leaks or to prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis.

In the case of gallstone pancreatitis, a gallstone travels from the gallbladder and blocks the opening to the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). This causes a backup of fluid that can travel up both the bile duct and the pancreatic duct. Gallbladder stones can lead to obstruction of the biliary tree via which gallbladder and pancreas enzymes are secreted into the duodenum, causing emergency events such as acute cholecystitis or acute pancreatitis.

In conditions such as ascending cholangitis due to obstructing gallstones, these stents play a crucial role. They help in maintaining the flow of bile and pancreatic juices from the gallbladder, pancreas, and bile ducts to the duodenum1. Biliary stents are often used during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to treat blockages that narrow your bile or pancreatic ducts. In cases of malignant biliary obstruction, endoscopic stent placement is one of the treatment options to relieve the obstruction. Biliary drainage is considered effective, particularly in bile duct conditions that are diagnosed and treated early.

==== Glaucoma drainage stent ====
Glaucoma drainage stents are recent developments and have been recently approved in some countries. They are used to reduce intraocular pressure by providing a drainage channel.

=== By properties or function ===
====Bare-metal stent====
A stent graft or covered stent is type of vascular stent with a fabric coating that creates a contained tube but is expandable like a bare metal stent. Covered stents are used in endovascular surgical procedures such as endovascular aneurysm repair. Stent grafts are also used to treat stenoses in vascular grafts and fistulas used for hemodialysis.

==== Bioresorbable stent ====

A bioresorbable stent is a tube-like device made from a material that can release a drug to prevent scar tissue growth. It is used to open and widen clogged heart arteries and then dissolves or is absorbed by the body. Unlike traditional metal stents, bioresorbable stents can restore normal vessel function, avoid long-term complications, and enable natural reconstruction of the arterial wall.

Metal-based bioresorbable scaffolds include iron, magnesium, zinc, and their alloys. Magnesium-based scaffolds have been approved for use in several countries around the world and show promising clinical results in delivering against the drawbacks of permanent metal stents. However, attention has been given to reducing the rate of magnesium corrosion through alloying and coating techniques.

Clinical research shows that resorbable scaffolds offer comparable efficacy and safety profiles to traditional drug-eluting stents (DES). The Magmaris resorbable magnesium scaffold has reported favorable safety outcomes similar to thin-strutted DES in patient populations. The Absorb naturally dissolving stent has also shown low rates of major adverse cardiac events when compared to DES. Imaging studies demonstrate that these naturally dissolving stents begin to dissolve between six months to two years after placement in the artery.

==== Drug-eluting stent ====

Drug-eluting stents (DES) are specialized medical devices used to treat coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease. They release a drug that inhibits cellular growth into the blocked or narrowed arteries, reducing the risk of blockages. DES are commonly placed using percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), a minimally invasive procedure performed via catheter. These stents have shown clear advantages over older bare-metal stents, improving patient outcomes and quality of life for cardiac patients. With over 90% of stents used in PCI procedures being drug-eluting as of 2023, DES have become the standard choice for interventional cardiologists.

DES gradually release drugs that prevent restenosis and thrombosis within the treated arteries, addressing common complications associated with previous treatments. While risks such as clot formation and bleeding exist, studies have demonstrated superior efficacy compared to bare-metal stents in reducing major adverse cardiac events like heart attacks and repeat revascularization procedures. Long-term outcomes are still being studied due to their relatively recent introduction; however, DES have revolutionized the treatment of coronary artery disease by significantly improving patient outcomes and enhancing their quality of life.

==Etymology==
The currently accepted origin of the word &quot;stent&quot; is that it derives from the name of an English dentist, Charles Thomas Stent (1807–1885), notable for his advances in the field of denture-making. He was born in Brighton, England, on October 17, 1807, was a dentist in London, and is most famous for improving and modifying the denture base of the gutta-percha, creating the stent&#x27;s compounding that made it practical as a material for dental impressions. 

Others attribute the noun &quot;stent&quot; to Jan F. Esser, a Dutch plastic surgeon who in 1916 used the word to describe a dental impression compound invented in 1856 by Charles Stent, whom Esser employed to craft a form for facial reconstruction. The full account is described in the &quot;Journal of the History of Dentistry&quot;. According to the author, from the use of Stent&#x27;s compound as a support for facial tissues evolved the use of a stent to hold open various body structures.

The verb form &quot;stenting&quot; was used for centuries to describe the process of stiffening garments (a usage long obsolete, per the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;), and some believe this to be the origin. According to the Merriam Webster Third New International Dictionary, the noun evolved from the Middle English verb , shortened from &#x27;to stretch&#x27;, which in turn came from Latin , the past participle of &#x27;to stretch out&#x27;.

The first (self-expanding) &quot;stents&quot; used in medical practice in 1986 by Ulrich Sigwart in Lausanne were initially called &quot;Wallstents&quot; after their inventor, Hans Wallstén.
Julio Palmaz &quot;et al.&quot; created a balloon-expandable stent that is currently used.

== History ==
The first use of a coronary stent is typically attributed to and Ulrich Sigwart, who implanted a stent into a patient in Toulouse, France, in 1986. That stent was used as a scaffold to prevent a vessel from closing and to avoid restenosis in coronary surgery—a condition where scar tissue grows within the stent and interferes with vascular flow. Shortly thereafter, in 1987, Julio Palmaz (known for patenting a balloon-expandable stent ) and Richard Schatz implanted their similar stent into a patient in Germany.

Though several doctors have been credited with the creation of the stent, the first FDA-approved stent in the U.S. was created by Richard Schatz and coworkers. Named the Palmaz-Schatz (Johnson &amp; Johnson), it was developed in 1987.

To further reduce the incidence of restenosis, the drug-eluting stent was introduced in 2003. Research has led to general stent design changes and improvements since that time. Bioresorbable scaffolds have also entered the market, though a large-scale clinical trial showed higher acute risks compared to drug-eluding stents. As a result, the FDA issued an official warning for their use in 2013, and research on the design and performance optimisation of stents is ongoing.

<doc id="414967" wikidata="Q61335" url="?curid=414967" title="Pre-eclampsia">
<text>Pre-eclampsia is a multi-system disorder specific to pregnancy, characterized by the new onset of high blood pressure and often a significant amount of protein in the urine or by the new onset of high blood pressure along with significant end-organ damage, with or without the proteinuria. When it arises, the condition begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy. In severe cases of the disease there may be red blood cell breakdown, a low blood platelet count, impaired liver function, kidney dysfunction, swelling, shortness of breath due to fluid in the lungs, or visual disturbances. Pre-eclampsia increases the risk of undesirable as well as lethal outcomes for both the mother and the fetus including preterm labor. If left untreated, it may result in seizures at which point it is known as eclampsia.

Risk factors for pre-eclampsia include obesity, prior hypertension, older age, and diabetes mellitus. It is also more frequent in a woman&#x27;s first pregnancy and if she is carrying twins. The underlying mechanisms are complex and involve abnormal formation of blood vessels in the placenta amongst other factors. Most cases are diagnosed before delivery, and may be categorized depending on the gestational week at delivery. Commonly, pre-eclampsia continues into the period after delivery, then known as postpartum pre-eclampsia. Rarely, pre-eclampsia may begin in the period after delivery. While historically both high blood pressure and protein in the urine were required to make the diagnosis, some definitions also include those with hypertension and any associated organ dysfunction. Blood pressure is defined as high when it is greater than 140 mmHg systolic or 90 mmHg diastolic at two separate times, more than four hours apart in a woman after twenty weeks of pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia is routinely screened during prenatal care.
Recommendations for prevention include: aspirin in those at high risk, calcium supplementation in areas with low intake, and treatment of prior hypertension with medications. In those with pre-eclampsia, delivery of the baby and placenta is an effective treatment but full recovery can take days or weeks. The point at which delivery becomes recommended depends on how severe the pre-eclampsia and how far along in pregnancy a woman is. Blood pressure medication, such as labetalol and methyldopa, may be used to improve the mother&#x27;s condition before delivery. Magnesium sulfate may be used to prevent eclampsia in those with severe disease. Bed rest and salt intake have not been found to be useful for either treatment or prevention.
Pre-eclampsia affects 2–8% of pregnancies worldwide. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (which include pre-eclampsia) are one of the most common causes of death due to pregnancy. They resulted in 46,900 deaths in 2015. Pre-eclampsia usually occurs after 32 weeks; however, if it occurs earlier it is associated with worse outcomes. Women who have had pre-eclampsia are at increased risk of high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke later in life. Further, those with pre-eclampsia may have a lower risk of breast cancer.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;eclampsia&quot; is from the Greek term for lightning. The first known description of the condition was by Hippocrates in the 5th century BC.

An outdated medical term for pre-eclampsia is of pregnancy, a term that originated in the mistaken belief that the condition was caused by toxins.

==Signs and symptoms==

Edema (especially in the hands and face) was originally considered an important sign for a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. However, because edema is a common occurrence in pregnancy, its utility as a distinguishing factor in pre-eclampsia is not high. Pitting edema (unusual swelling, particularly of the hands, feet, or face, notable by leaving an indentation when pressed on) can be significant, and should be reported to a health care provider.

Further, a symptom such as epigastric pain may be misinterpreted as heartburn. Common features of pre-eclampsia which are screened for during pre-natal visits include elevated blood pressure and excess protein in the urine. Additionally, some women may develop severe headache as a sign of pre-eclampsia. In general, none of the signs of pre-eclampsia are specific, and even convulsions in pregnancy are more likely to have causes other than eclampsia in modern practice. Diagnosis depends on finding a coincidence of several pre-eclamptic features, the final proof being their regression within the days and weeks after delivery.

==Causes==
The cause of preeclampsia is not fully understood. It is likely related factors such as: 
* Abnormal placentation (formation and development of the placenta) 
* Immunologic factors
* Prior or existing maternal pathologypre-eclampsia is seen more at a higher incidence in individuals with pre-existing hypertension, obesity, or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome or those with a history of pre-eclampsia
* Dietary factors, e.g. calcium supplementation in areas where dietary calcium intake is low has been shown to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia 
* Environmental factors, e.g. air pollution

Those with long-term high blood pressure have a 7 to 8 times higher risk than those without.

Physiologically, research has linked pre-eclampsia to the following physiologic changes: alterations in the interaction between the maternal immune response and the placenta, placental injury, endothelial cell injury, altered vascular reactivity, oxidative stress, imbalance among vasoactive substances, decreased intravascular volume, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

While the exact cause of pre-eclampsia remains unclear, there is strong evidence that a major cause predisposing a susceptible woman to pre-eclampsia is an abnormally implanted placenta. This abnormally implanted placenta may result in poor uterine and placental perfusion, yielding a state of hypoxia and increased oxidative stress and the release of anti-angiogenic proteins along with inflammatory mediators into the maternal plasma. A major consequence of this sequence of events is generalized endothelial dysfunction. The abnormal implantation may stem from the maternal immune system&#x27;s response to the placenta, specifically a lack of established immunological tolerance in pregnancy. Endothelial dysfunction results in hypertension and many of the other symptoms and complications associated with pre-eclampsia. When pre-eclampsia develops in the last weeks of pregnancy or in a multiple pregnancy, the causation may in some cases, partly be due to a large placenta outgrowing the capacity of the uterus, eventually leading to the symptoms of pre-eclampsia.

Abnormal chromosome 19 microRNA cluster (C19MC) impairs extravillus trophoblast cell invasion to the spiral arteries, causing high resistance, low blood flow, and low nutrient supply to the fetus.

===Genetic factors===
Despite a lack of knowledge on specific causal mechanisms of pre-eclampsia, there is strong evidence to suggest it results from both environmental and heritable factors. A 2005 study showed that women with a first-degree relative who had a pre-eclamptic birth are twice as likely to develop it themselves. Furthermore, men related to someone with affected birth have an increased risk of fathering a pre-eclamptic pregnancy. Fetuses affected by pre-eclampsia have a higher chance of later pregnancy complications including growth restriction, prematurity, and stillbirth.

The onset of pre-eclampsia is thought to be caused by several complex interactions between genetics and environmental factors. Our current understanding of the specifically heritable cause involves an imbalance of angiogenic factors in the placenta. Angiogenesis involves the growth of new blood vessels from existing vessels, and an imbalance during pregnancy can affect the vascularization, growth, and biological function of the fetus. The irregular expression of these factors is thought to be controlled by multiple loci on different chromosomes. Research on the topic has been limited because of the heterogeneous nature of the disease. Maternal, paternal, and fetal genotypes all play a role as well as complex epigenetic factors such as whether the parents smoke, maternal age, sexual cohabitation, and obesity. Currently, there is very little understanding behind the mechanisms of these interactions. Due to the polygenic nature of pre-eclampsia, a majority of the studies that have been conducted thus far on the topic have utilized genome-wide association studies.

One known effector of pre-eclampsia is the fetal loci FLT1. Located on chromosome 13 in the q12 region, FLT1 codes for Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1, an angiogenic factor expressed in fetal trophoblasts. Angiogenic factors are crucial for vascular growth in the placenta. An FLT1 soluble isoform caused by a splice variant is sFLT1, which works as an antiangiogenic factor, reducing vascular growth in the placenta. A healthy, normotensive pregnancy is characterized by a balance between these factors. However, upregulation of this variant and overexpression of sFL1 can contribute to endothelial dysfunction. Reduced vascular growth and endothelial dysfunction manifest primarily in maternal symptoms such as renal failure, edema, and seizures. However, these factors can also lead to inadequate oxygen, nutrient, or blood supply to the fetus. Furthermore, in this loci region, several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been observed to impact the overexpression of sFL1. Specifically, SNPs rs12050029 and rs4769613&#x27;s risk alleles are linked with low red blood cell counts and carry an increased risk of late-onset pre-eclampsia.

Patau syndrome, or Trisomy 13, is also associated with the upregulation of sFLT1 due to the extra copy of the 13th chromosome. Because of this upregulation of an antiangiogenic factor, women with trisomy 13 pregnancies often experience reduced placental vascularization and are at higher risk for developing pre-eclampsia.

Beyond fetal loci, there have been some maternal loci identified as effectors of pre-eclampsia. Alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylase expression on chromosome 16 in the q12 region is also associated with pre-eclampsia. Specifically, allele rs1421085 heightens the risk of not just pre-eclampsia but also an increase in BMI and hypertension. This pleiotropy is one of the reasons why these traits are considered to be a risk factor. Furthermore, ZNF831 (zinc finger protein 831) and its loci on chromosome 20q13 were identified as another significant factor in pre-eclampsia. The risk allele rs259983 is also associated with both pre-eclampsia and hypertension, further evidence that the two traits are possibly linked.

While the current understanding suggests that maternal alleles are the main hereditary cause of pre-eclampsia, paternal loci have also been implicated. In one study, paternal DLX5 (Distal-Less Homeobox 5) was identified as an imprinted gene. Located on chromosome 7 in the q21 region, DLX5 serves as a transcription factor often linked with the developmental growth of organs. When paternally inherited, DLX5 and its SNP rs73708843 are shown to play a role in trophoblast proliferation, affecting vascular growth and nutrient delivery.

Besides specific loci, several important genetic regulatory factors contribute to the development of pre-eclampsia. Micro RNAs, or miRNAs, are noncoding mRNAs that down-regulate posttranscriptional gene expression through RNA-induced silencing complexes. In the placenta, miRNAs are crucial for regulating cell growth, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and metabolism. These placental-specific miRNAs are clustered in large groups, mainly on chromosomes 14 and 19, and irregular expression of either is associated with an increased risk of an affected pregnancy. For instance, miR-16 and miR-29 are vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and play a role in upregulating sFLT-1. In particular, the overexpression of miRNA miR-210 has been shown to induce hypoxia, which affects spiral artery remodeling, an important part of the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia.

===Risk factors===
Known risk factors for pre-eclampsia include: 
* Having never previously given birth
* Diabetes mellitus
* Endometriosis
* Obesity
* Advanced maternal age (&gt;35 years)
* Kidney disease
* Untreated hypertension
* Prior history of pre-eclampsia
* Family history of pre-eclampsia 
* Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome
* Multiple gestation
* Having donated a kidney
* Having sub-clinical hypothyroidism or thyroid antibodies
* Placental abnormalities such as placental ischemia
* Socioeconomics play a large role in the prevalence of these risk factors, and, like other processes, each risk factor plays a role in the likelihood of increased consequences (morbidity) to, and the complexity of care for, the hospitalized patient

==Pathogenesis==
Although much research into mechanism of pre-eclampsia has taken place, its exact pathogenesis remains uncertain. Pre-eclampsia is thought to result from an abnormal placenta, the removal of which ends the disease in most cases. During normal pregnancy, the placenta vascularizes to allow for the exchange of water, gases, and solutes, including nutrients and wastes, between maternal and fetal circulations. Abnormal development of the placenta leads to poor placental perfusion. The placenta of women with pre-eclampsia is abnormal and characterized by poor trophoblastic invasion. It is thought that this results in oxidative stress, hypoxia, and the release of factors that promote endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and other possible reactions.

In normal early embryonic development, the outer epithelial layer contains cytotrophoblast cells, a stem cell type found in the trophoblast that later differentiates into the fetal placenta. These cells differentiate into many placental cells types, including extravillous trophoblast cells. Extravillous trophoblast cells are an invasive cell type which remodel the maternal spiral arteries by replacing the maternal epithelium and smooth muscle lining the spiral arteries, thus causing and maintaining spiral artery dilation. This prevents maternal vasoconstriction in the spiral arteries and allows for continued blood and nutrient supply to the growing fetus with low resistance and high blood flow.

The clinical manifestations of pre-eclampsia are associated with general endothelial dysfunction, including vasoconstriction and end-organ ischemia. Implicit in this generalized endothelial dysfunction may be an imbalance of angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors. Both circulating and placental levels of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) are higher in women with pre-eclampsia than in women with normal pregnancy. sFlt-1 is an anti-angiogenic protein that antagonizes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PIGF), both of which are proangiogenic factors. Soluble endoglin (sEng) has also been shown to be elevated in women with pre-eclampsia and has anti-angiogenic properties, much like sFlt-1 does.

Both sFlt-1 and sEng are upregulated in all pregnant women to some extent, supporting the idea that hypertensive disease in pregnancy is a normal pregnancy adaptation gone awry. As natural killer cells are intimately involved in placentation and placentation involves a degree of maternal immune tolerance for a foreign placenta, it is not surprising that the maternal immune system might respond more negatively to the arrival of some placentae under certain circumstances, such as a placenta which is more invasive than normal. Initial maternal rejection of the placental cytotrophoblasts may be the cause of the inadequately remodeled spiral arteries in those cases of pre-eclampsia associated with shallow implantation, leading to downstream hypoxia and the appearance of maternal symptoms in response to upregulated sFlt-1 and sEng.

Oxidative stress may also play an important part in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. The main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the enzyme xanthine oxidase (XO) and this enzyme mainly occurs in the liver. One hypothesis is that the increased purine catabolism from placental hypoxia results in increased ROS production in the maternal liver and release into the maternal circulation that causes endothelial cell damage.

Abnormalities in the maternal immune system and insufficiency of gestational immune tolerance seem to play major roles in pre-eclampsia. One of the main differences found in pre-eclampsia is a shift toward Th1 responses and the production of IFN-γ. The origin of IFN-γ is not clearly identified and could be the natural killer cells of the uterus, the placental dendritic cells modulating responses of T helper cells, alterations in synthesis of or response to regulatory molecules, or changes in the function of regulatory T cells in pregnancy. Aberrant immune responses promoting pre-eclampsia may also be due to an altered fetal allorecognition or to inflammatory triggers. It has been documented that fetal cells such as fetal erythroblasts as well as cell-free fetal DNA are increased in the maternal circulation in women who develop pre-eclampsia. These findings have given rise to the hypothesis that pre-eclampsia is a disease process by which a placental lesion such as hypoxia allows increased fetal material into the maternal circulation, that in turn leads to an immune response and endothelial damage, and that ultimately results in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.

One hypothesis for vulnerability to pre-eclampsia is the maternal-fetal conflict between the maternal organism and fetus. After the first trimester trophoblasts enter the spiral arteries of the mother to alter the spiral arteries and thereby gain more access to maternal nutrients. Occasionally there is impaired trophoblast invasion that results in inadequate alterations to the uterine spiral arteries. It is hypothesized that the developing embryo releases biochemical signals that result in the woman developing hypertension and pre-eclampsia so that the fetus can benefit from a greater amount of maternal circulation of nutrients due to increased blood flow to the impaired placenta. This results in a conflict between maternal and fetal fitness and survival because the fetus is invested in only its survival and fitness while the mother is invested in this and subsequent pregnancies.

In pre-eclampsia, abnormal expression of chromosome 19 microRNA cluster (C19MC) in placental cell lines reduces extravillus trophoblast migration. Specific microRNAs in this cluster which might cause abnormal spiral artery invasion include miR-520h, miR-520b, and 520c-3p. This impairs extravillus trophoblast cells invasion to the maternal spiral arteries, causing high resistance and low blood flow and low nutrient supply to the fetus. There is tentative evidence that vitamin supplementation can decrease the risk.

Immune factors may also play a role.

==Diagnosis==
Testing for pre-eclampsia is recommended throughout pregnancy via measuring a woman&#x27;s blood pressure.

===Diagnostic criteria===
Pre-eclampsia is diagnosed when a pregnant woman develops:
* Blood pressure ≥140 mmHg systolic or ≥90 mmHg diastolic on two separate readings taken at least four to six hours apart after 20 weeks&#x27; gestation in an individual with previously normal blood pressure.
* In a woman with essential hypertension beginning before 20 weeks&#x27; gestational age, the diagnostic criteria are an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥30 mmHg or an increase in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥15 mmHg.
* Proteinuria ≥ or more of protein in a 24-hour urine sample or a SPOT urinary protein to creatinine ratio ≥0.3 or a urine dipstick reading of 1+ or greater (dipstick reading should only be used if other quantitative methods are not available).

Suspicion for pre-eclampsia should be maintained in any pregnancy complicated by elevated blood pressure, even in the absence of proteinuria. Ten percent of individuals with other signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia and 20% of individuals diagnosed with eclampsia show no evidence of proteinuria. In the absence of proteinuria, the presence of new-onset hypertension (elevated blood pressure) and the new onset of one or more of the following is suggestive of the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia: 
* Evidence of kidney dysfunction (oliguria, elevated creatinine levels)
* Impaired liver function (noted by liver function tests)
* Thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;100,000/microliter)
* Pulmonary edema
*Ankle edema (pitting type)
* Cerebral or visual disturbances

Pre-eclampsia is a progressive disorder and these signs of organ dysfunction are indicative of severe pre-eclampsia. A systolic blood pressure ≥160 or diastolic blood pressure ≥110 and/or proteinuria &gt;5g in a 24-hour period is also indicative of severe pre-eclampsia. Clinically, individuals with severe pre-eclampsia may also present epigastric/right upper quadrant abdominal pain, headaches, and vomiting. Severe pre-eclampsia is a significant risk factor for intrauterine fetal death.

A rise in baseline blood pressure (BP) of 30 mmHg systolic or 15 mmHg diastolic, while not meeting the absolute criteria of 140/90, is important to note but is not considered diagnostic.

=== Predictive tests ===
There have been many assessments of tests aimed at predicting pre-eclampsia, though no single biomarker is likely to be sufficiently predictive of the disorder. Predictive tests that have been assessed include those related to placental perfusion, vascular resistance, kidney dysfunction, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Examples of notable tests include:
* Doppler ultrasonography of the uterine arteries to investigate for signs of inadequate placental perfusion. This test has a high negative predictive value among those individuals with a history of prior pre-eclampsia.
* Elevations in serum uric acid (hyperuricemia) is used by some to &quot;define&quot; pre-eclampsia, though it has been found to be a poor predictor of the disorder. Elevated levels in the blood (hyperuricemia) are likely due to reduced uric acid clearance secondary to impaired kidney function.
* Angiogenic proteins such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PIGF) and anti-angiogenic proteins such as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) have shown promise for potential clinical use in diagnosing pre-eclampsia, though evidence is insufficient to recommend a clinical use for these markers.
A recent study, ASPRE, known to be the largest multi-country prospective trial, has reported a significant performance in identifying pregnant women at high risk of pre-eclampsia yet during the first trimester of pregnancy. Utilizing a combination of maternal history, mean arterial blood pressure, intrauterine Doppler and PlGF measurement, the study has shown a capacity to identify more than 75% of the women that will develop pre-eclampsia, allowing early intervention to prevent development of later symptoms. This approach is now officially recommended by the International Federation of Gynecologists &amp; Obstetricians (FIGO), However this model particularly predict pre-eclampsia with onset before 34 weeks&#x27; of gestation, while prediction of pre-eclampsia with later onset remains challenging.

* Recent studies have shown that looking for podocytes (specialized cells of the kidney) in the urine has the potential to aid in the prediction of pre-eclampsia. Studies have demonstrated that finding podocytes in the urine may serve as an early marker of and diagnostic test for pre-eclampsia.

===Differential diagnosis===

Pre-eclampsia can mimic and be confused with many other diseases, including chronic hypertension, chronic renal disease, primary seizure disorders, gallbladder and pancreatic disease, immune or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, antiphospholipid syndrome and hemolytic-uremic syndrome. It must be considered a possibility in any pregnant woman beyond 20 weeks of gestation. It is particularly difficult to diagnose when pre-existing conditions such as hypertension are present. Women with acute fatty liver of pregnancy may also present with elevated blood pressure and protein in the urine, but differ by the extent of liver damage. Other disorders that can cause high blood pressure include thyrotoxicosis, pheochromocytoma, and drug misuse.

==Prevention==
Preventive measures against pre-eclampsia have been heavily studied. Because the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia is not completely understood, prevention remains a complex issue. Some currently accepted recommendations are:

===Diet===
Supplementation with a balanced protein and energy diet does not appear to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia. Further, there is no evidence that changing salt intake has an effect.

Supplementation with antioxidants such as vitamin C, D and E has no effect on pre-eclampsia incidence; therefore, supplementation with vitamins C, E, and D is not recommended for reducing the risk of pre-eclampsia.

Calcium supplementation of at least 1 gram per day is recommended during pregnancy as it prevents pre-eclampsia where dietary calcium intake is low, especially for those at high risk. Higher selenium level is associated with lower incidence of pre-eclampsia. Higher cadmium level is associated with higher incidence of pre-eclampsia.

===Aspirin===
Taking aspirin is associated with a 1 to 5% reduction in pre-eclampsia and a 1 to 5% reduction in premature births in women at high risk. The World Health Organization recommends low-dose aspirin for the prevention of pre-eclampsia in women at high risk and recommends it be started before 20 weeks of pregnancy. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends a low-dose regimen for women at high risk beginning in the 12th week. Benefits are less if started after 16 weeks. Since 2018 the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has recommended low-dose aspirin therapy as standard preventive treatment for pre-eclampsia. There is a reported problem of its efficacy when combined with paracetamol. Supplementation of aspirin with L-Arginine has shown favourable results.

The study ASPRE, besides its efficacy in identifying women suspected to develop pre-eclampsia, has also been able to demonstrate a strong drop in the rate of early pre-eclampsia (-82%) and preterm pre-eclampsia (-62%). The efficacy of aspirin is due to screening to identify high risk women, adjusted prophylaxis dosage (150 mg/day), timing of the intake (bedtime) and must start before week 16 of pregnancy.

===Physical activity===
There is insufficient evidence to recommend either exercise or strict bedrest as preventive measures of pre-eclampsia.

===Smoking cessation===
In low-risk pregnancies, the association between cigarette smoking and a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia has been consistent and reproducible across epidemiologic studies. High-risk pregnancies (those with pregestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, history of pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy, or multifetal gestation) showed no significant protective effect. The reason for this discrepancy is not definitively known; research supports speculation that the underlying pathology increases the risk of pre-eclampsia to such a degree that any measurable reduction of risk due to smoking is masked. However, the damaging effects of smoking on overall health and pregnancy outcomes outweighs the benefits in decreasing the incidence of pre-eclampsia. It is recommended that smoking be stopped prior to, during and after pregnancy.

===Immune modulation===
Some studies have suggested the importance of a woman&#x27;s gestational immunological tolerance to her baby&#x27;s father, as the baby and father share genetics. However, more recent studies have found no evidence that this is a risk factor for pre-eclampsia or other adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Several other studies have since investigated the decreased incidence of pre-eclampsia in women who had received blood transfusions from their partner, those with long preceding histories of sex without barrier contraceptives, and in women who had been regularly performing oral sex.

Having already noted the importance of a woman&#x27;s immunological tolerance to her baby&#x27;s paternal genes, several Dutch reproductive biologists decided to take their research a step further. Consistent with the fact that human immune systems tolerate things better when they enter the body via the mouth, the Dutch researchers conducted a series of studies that confirmed a surprisingly strong correlation between a diminished incidence of pre-eclampsia and a woman&#x27;s practice of oral sex, and noted that the protective effects were strongest if she swallowed her partner&#x27;s semen. A team from the University of Adelaide has also investigated to see if men who have fathered pregnancies which have ended in miscarriage or pre-eclampsia had low seminal levels of critical immune modulating factors such as TGF-beta. The team has found that certain men, dubbed &quot;dangerous males&quot;, are several times more likely to father pregnancies that would end in either pre-eclampsia or miscarriage. Among other things, most of the &quot;dangerous males&quot; seemed to lack sufficient levels of the seminal immune factors necessary to induce immunological tolerance in their partners.

As the theory of immune intolerance as a cause of pre-eclampsia has gained prominence, women with repeated pre-eclampsia, miscarriages, or in vitro fertilization failures could potentially be administered key immune factors such as TGF-beta along with the father&#x27;s foreign proteins, possibly either orally, as a sublingual spray, or as a vaginal gel to be applied onto the vaginal wall before intercourse.

More recent studies, though, have called these concepts into question. The human body contains a placental barrier to prevent the immune cells of the mother from destroying the cells of the placenta, and no definitive link has been found between partner selection and adverse pregnancy outcomes, despite many attempts by researchers.

==Treatment==
The definitive treatment for pre-eclampsia is the delivery of the baby and placenta, but danger to the mother persists after delivery, and full recovery can take days or weeks. The timing of delivery should balance the desire for optimal outcomes for the baby while reducing risks for the mother. The severity of disease and the maturity of the baby are primary considerations. These considerations are situation specific, and management will vary with situation, location, and institution. Treatment can range from expectant management to expedited delivery by induction of labor or caesarean section. In the case of preterm delivery additional treatments including corticosteroid injection to accelerate fetal pulmonary maturation and magnesium sulfate for prevention of cerebral palsy should be considered. Important in management is the assessment of the mother&#x27;s organ systems, management of severe hypertension, and prevention and treatment of eclamptic seizures. Separate interventions directed at the baby may also be necessary. Bed rest has not been found to be useful and is thus not routinely recommended.

===Blood pressure===
The World Health Organization recommends that women with severe hypertension during pregnancy should receive treatment with anti-hypertensive agents. Severe hypertension is generally considered systolic BP of at least 160 or diastolic BP of at least 110. Evidence does not support the use of one anti-hypertensive over another. The choice of which agent to use should be based on the prescribing clinician&#x27;s experience with a particular agent, its cost, and its availability. Diuretics are not recommended for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its complications. Labetalol, hydralazine and nifedipine are commonly used antihypertensive agents for hypertension in pregnancy. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are contraindicated as they affect fetal development.

The goal of treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy is to prevent cardiovascular, kidney, and cerebrovascular complications. The target blood pressure has been proposed to be 140–160 mmHg systolic and 90–105 mmHg diastolic, although values are variable.

===Prevention of eclampsia===
The intrapartum and postpartum administration of magnesium sulfate is recommended in severe pre-eclampsia for the prevention of eclampsia. Further, magnesium sulfate is recommended for the treatment of eclampsia over other anticonvulsants. Magnesium sulfate acts by interacting with NMDA receptors.

==Epidemiology==
Pre-eclampsia affects approximately 2–8% of all pregnancies worldwide. The incidence of pre-eclampsia has risen in the U.S. since the 1990s, possibly as a result of increased prevalence of predisposing disorders, such as chronic hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.

Pre-eclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Nearly one-tenth of all maternal deaths in Africa and Asia and one-quarter in Latin America are associated with hypertensive diseases in pregnancy, a category that encompasses pre-eclampsia.

Pre-eclampsia is much more common in women who are pregnant for the first time. Women who have previously been diagnosed with pre-eclampsia are also more likely to experience pre-eclampsia in subsequent pregnancies. Pre-eclampsia is also more common in women who have pre-existing hypertension, obesity, diabetes, autoimmune diseases such as lupus, various inherited thrombophilias such as Factor V Leiden, renal disease, multiple gestation (twins or multiple birth), and advanced maternal age. Women who live at high altitude are also more likely to experience pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is also more common in some ethnic groups (e.g. African-Americans, Sub-Saharan Africans, Latin Americans, African Caribbeans, and Filipinos).

Eclampsia is a major complication of pre-eclampsia. Eclampsia affects 0.56 per 1,000 pregnant women in developed countries and almost 10 to 30 times as many women in low-income countries as in developed countries.

==Complications==
Complications of pre-eclampsia can affect both the mother and the fetus. Acutely, pre-eclampsia can be complicated by eclampsia, the development of HELLP syndrome, hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, liver damage and dysfunction, acute kidney injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Pre-eclampsia is also associated with increased frequency of caesarean section, preterm delivery, and placental abruption. Furthermore, an elevation in blood pressure can occur in some individuals in the first week postpartum attributable to volume expansion and fluid mobilization. Fetal complications include fetal growth restriction and potential fetal or perinatal death.

Long-term, an individual with pre-eclampsia is at increased risk for recurrence of pre-eclampsia in subsequent pregnancies.

===Eclampsia===
Eclampsia is the development of new convulsions in a pre-eclamptic patient that may not be attributed to other causes. It is a sign that the underlying pre-eclamptic condition is severe and is associated with high rates of perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. Warning symptoms for eclampsia in an individual with current pre-eclampsia may include headaches, visual disturbances, and right upper quadrant or epigastric abdominal pain, with a headache being the most consistent symptom. During pregnancy brisk or hyperactive reflexes are common, however, ankle clonus is a sign of neuromuscular irritability that usually reflects severe pre-eclampsia and also can precede eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate is used to prevent convulsions in cases of severe pre-eclampsia.

===HELLP Syndrome===
HELLP syndrome is defined as hemolysis (microangiopathic), elevated liver enzymes (liver dysfunction), and low platelets (thrombocytopenia). This condition may occur in 10–20% of patients with severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia and is associated with increased maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. In 50% of instances, HELLP syndrome develops preterm, while 20% of cases develop in late gestation and 30% during the post-partum period.

===Long term===
Preeclampsia predisposes for future cardiovascular disease and a history of preeclampsia/eclampsia doubles the risk for cardiovascular mortality later in life. Other risks include stroke, chronic hypertension, kidney disease and venous thromboembolism. Preeclampsia and cardiovascular disease share many risk factors such as age, elevated BMI, family history and certain chronic diseases.

It seems that pre-eclampsia does not increase the risk of cancer.

Lowered blood supply to the fetus in pre-eclampsia causes lowered nutrient supply, which could result in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and low birth weight. The fetal origins hypothesis states that fetal undernutrition is linked with coronary heart disease later in adult life due to disproportionate growth.

Because pre-eclampsia leads to a mismatch between the maternal energy supply and fetal energy demands, pre-eclampsia can lead to IUGR in the developing fetus. Infants with IUGR are prone to have poor neuronal development and in increased risk for adult disease according to the Barker hypothesis. Associated adult diseases of the fetus due to IUGR include, but are not limited to, coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cancer, osteoporosis, and various psychiatric illnesses.

The risk of pre-eclampsia and development of placental dysfunction has also been shown to be recurrent cross-generationally on the maternal side and most likely on the paternal side. Fetuses born to mothers who were born small for gestational age (SGA) were 50% more likely to develop pre-eclampsia while fetuses born to both SGA parents were three-fold more likely to develop pre-eclampsia in future pregnancies.

== Postpartum preeclampsia ==
Preeclampsia can also occur in the postpartum period or after delivery. There are currently no clear definitions or guidelines for postpartum preeclampsia, but experts have proposed a definition of new-onset preeclampsia that occurs between 48 hours after delivery up to 6 weeks after delivery.

The diagnostic criteria otherwise are essentially the same as for preeclampsia diagnosed during pregnancy. Similarly, many of the risk factors are the same, except that not having been pregnant previously does not seem to be a risk factor for postpartum preeclampsia. There are other risk factors related to the labor and/or delivery that are associated with postpartum preeclampsia like cesarean delivery and higher rates of intravenous fluids.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends blood pressure evaluation for patients who have any hypertensive disorder of pregnancy within 7–10 days after delivery. Home blood pressure monitoring may increase the likelihood of measuring blood pressure during these recommended time periods.

In general, the treatment of postpartum preeclampsia is the same as during pregnancy, including using anti-hypertensive medications to lower blood pressure and magnesium sulfate to prevent eclampsia. The same blood pressure medications that are used during pregnancy can be used in the postpartum period. There may be other medications that can be used, when there is no longer concern for the developing fetus. In general, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers all appear to be safe in lactating patients. There is no data showing that any one medication is most effective for postpartum blood pressure management. In addition, there is evidence that the use of a diuretic, furosemide, may shorten the duration of hypertension in patients with postpartum preeclampsia.

== Other animals ==
Primates can also rarely experience pre-eclampsia. In 2024, a female western lowland gorilla was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia and had a successful caesarean section.

<text>Kaman Corporation is an American aerospace company, with headquarters in Bloomfield, Connecticut. It was founded in 1945 by Charles Kaman. During the first ten years the company operated exclusively as a designer and manufacturer of several helicopters that set world records and achieved many aviation firsts.

In 1956, Kaman began to diversify as an aerospace subcontractor of McDonnell Douglas, Grumman, and others. In the mid-1960s Kaman diversified outside of the aerospace industry, using the expertise Kaman had gained in composite materials and the end of the need for skilled woodworkers to craft wooden rotor blades. Charles Kaman, a guitarist as well as an aerospace pioneer, worked with his engineers and other musicians to create the round-backed, composite-body Ovation guitar, which led to the eventual creation of Kaman Music, a major distributor and manufacturer of musical instruments and accessories.

==History==
Charles Kaman founded the company in December 1945 with $2,000 of capital and his invention of the servo-flap controlled rotor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Web.mit.edu/invent/iow/kaman.html_2003-03-18&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="414975" wikidata="Q1991865" url="?curid=414975" title="Auction catalog">
<text>An auction catalog (US spelling) or auction catalogue (British spelling) is inventory of listing of items to be sold at an auction. It is made available some time before the auction date. Auction catalogs for rare and expensive items, such as art, books, jewelry, postage stamps, furniture, wine, cars, posters, published for sales around the world, can be of interest in themselves--they will can include detailed descriptions of the items, their provenance, historical significance, photographs, and even comparative analyses and descriptive essays by subject experts. 

In some cases, auction catalogues are key documentation for rare objects that are in private collections, and make up an important part of the libraries for students of material culture, appraisers, museums, and dealers.

Each entry typically includes a &quot;lot number&quot; identifying each item uniquely, a description of the item, and either an estimated price or a &quot;reserve&quot; price below which the item will not be sold. Photographs may appear with the entry, or grouped into a separate section of the catalog; for lower value items, the textual description may be considered sufficient.

As a combined information source and &quot;sales brochure&quot;, an auction catalog must tread a fine line between accuracy and promotion. For instance, any damages or flaws must be described exactly, so that buyers cannot claim to have been deceived, but at the same time the description will typically include words playing down the bad points (as in &quot;brownish spot that does not detract from appearance&quot; or &quot;faint crease, as is common&quot;). Similarly, positive features are highlighted, such as &quot;one of only four known examples of this type&quot;, or perhaps a photograph of an item of jewelry being worn by a famous person.

Auction catalogs may be sent to favored customers without charge, but catalogs may be charged for, sometimes as much or more than other kinds of book. Important historical catalogs may be sold by bookstores, or even appear as items in book auctions.

Some time after the auction is concluded, recipients of the auction catalogs may receive a &quot;prices realized&quot; document, a bare listing of the lot numbers and the prices for which each was sold. Prices may be posted online. Some collectors annotate their copies of the catalogs, to record prices brought and even buyers&#x27; identities.

The actual physical auction catalog is limited to print runs which started in 2005 when the major auction houses created their own app. Since 2020, it is rare that you can purchase the physical auction catalog. The auction is completely cataloged online. Bidding is done online and the auction results can only be printed online. The auction houses allow users to look at past sales for getting estimates.

<doc id="414980" wikidata="Q926801" url="?curid=414980" title="Harry Ricardo">
<text>Sir Harry Ralph Ricardo (26 January 1885 – 18 May 1974) was an English engineer who was one of the foremost engine designers and researchers in the early years of the development of the internal combustion engine.

Among his many other works, he improved the engines that were used in the first tanks, oversaw the research into the physics of internal combustion that led to the use of octane ratings, was instrumental in development of the sleeve valve engine design, and invented the Diesel &quot;Comet&quot; Swirl chamber that made high-speed diesel engines economically feasible.

==Early life==
Harry Ricardo was born at 13 Bedford Square, London, in 1885, the eldest of three children, and only son of Halsey Ricardo, the architect, and his wife Catherine Jane, daughter of Sir Alexander Meadows Rendel, a civil engineer. Ricardo was descended from a brother of the famous political economist David Ricardo, a Sephardi Jew of Portuguese origin. He was one of the first people in England to see an automobile when his grandfather purchased one in 1898. He was from a relatively wealthy family and educated at Rugby School. In October 1903 he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge as a civil engineering student. Ricardo had been using tools and building engines since the age of ten.

==Marriage==
In 1911 Ricardo married Beatrice Bertha Hale, an art student at the Slade School of Art, in London. Her father, Charles Bowdich Hale, was the Ricardos&#x27; family doctor. They had three daughters, and lived most of their married life at Lancing and Edburton in West Sussex.

== Car engines ==

In 1904, at the end of his first year at Cambridge, Ricardo decided to enter the University Automobile Club&#x27;s event, which was a competition to design a machine that could travel the furthest on 1 imperial quart (1.14 L) of petrol. His engine had a single cylinder, and was the heaviest entered, but his motorcycle design won the competition, having covered a distance of . He was then persuaded to join Bertram Hopkinson, Professor of Mechanism and Applied Mechanics, researching engine performance. He graduated in 1906 and spent another year researching at Cambridge.

Ricardo is said by Percy Kidner, then co-managing director of Vauxhall, to have had a hand in the design of the Vauxhall engine designed by Laurence Pomeroy for the RAC trial of 1908.

Before graduation, Ricardo designed a two-stroke motorcycle engine to study the effect of mixture strength upon the combustion process. When he graduated, the small firm of Messrs Lloyd and Plaister expressed interest in making the engine. Ricardo produced designs for two sizes, and the smaller one sold about 50 engines until 1914, when the war halted production.

In 1909 Ricardo designed a novel two-stroke split cycle 3.3-litre engine for his cousin Ralph Ricardo, who had established a small car manufacturing company, &quot;Two Stroke Engine Company&quot;, at Shoreham-by-Sea. The engine was to be used in the &quot;Dolphin&quot; car. The cars were well made, but they cost more to make than the selling price. The company fared better making two-stroke engines for fishing boats. In 1911 the firm collapsed and Ralph departed for India. Ricardo continued to design engines for small electric lighting sets; these were produced by two companies until 1914.

Interest in the 1909 Ricardo designed split cycle Dolphin engine continues and in 2017 Ricardo PLC formed a new consortium called Dolphin-N2 to further develop the concept. 
In 2019 Dolphin N2 was purchased by FPT Industrial who claim The Recuperated Split Cycle engine has the potential to reduce fossil fuel use by up to 30% whilst simultaneously reducing air pollutants to well below any future planned legislation. 

== Tank engines ==
In 1915 Ricardo set up a new company, &quot;Engine Patents Ltd.&quot;, which developed the engine that would eventually be used in the first successful tank design, the British Mark V. The Daimler sleeve-valve engine used in the Mark I created copious amounts of smoke, which easily gave away its position. Ricardo was asked to look at the problem of reducing smoky exhaust gases and decided that a new engine was needed. Existing companies were able to fulfill the construction of such an engine but not the design, so Ricardo set himself to the task. He succeeded in designing a new six-cylinder engine with reduced smoke emissions, which was also much more powerful, and still fit into the same space as the existing one. It produced , compared with , and later modifications produced and 

By April 1917 one hundred engines were being produced a week.
A total of over 8,000 engines were put into military service, powering all of the British heavy tanks of the First World War since the Mark V. In addition, several hundred of the engines were also used in France for providing power and light to base workshops, hospitals, camps, etc.

==Aircraft engines==
In 1917 his old mentor, Bertram Hopkinson, who was now Technical Director at the Air Ministry, invited Ricardo to join the new engine research facility at the Department of Military Aeronautics, later to become the RAE. In 1918 Hopkinson was killed while flying a Bristol Fighter, and Ricardo took over his position. From that point on the department produced a string of experimental engines and research reports that constantly drove the British, and world, engine industry.

One of Ricardo&#x27;s first major research projects was on the problems of irregular combustion, known as &quot;knocking&quot; or &quot;pinging&quot;. To study the problem he built a unique variable-compression test engine. This led to the development of an octane rating system for fuels, and considerable investment into octane improving additives and refining systems. The dramatic reduction in fuel use as a result of higher-octane fuel was directly responsible for allowing Alcock and Brown to fly the Atlantic in their Vickers Vimy bombers adapted with his modifications.

==Advances in engine design==

In 1919 Ricardo was studying the phenomena affecting the combustion within the petrol engine and the diesel engine. He realised that turbulence within the combustion chamber increased flame speed, and that he could achieve this by offsetting the cylinder head. He also realised that making the chamber as compact as possible would reduce the distance that the flame had to travel and would reduce the likelihood of detonation. He later developed the induction swirl chamber, which was an attempt to achieve orderly air motion in a diesel engine, the swirl being initiated by inclined ports and accentuated by forcing the air into a small cylindrical volume. Finally he developed the compression swirl chamber for diesel engines. This design embodied intense swirl with a reasonable rate of pressure rise and good fuel consumption.

The compression swirl chamber design was called a &quot;Comet&quot; design (patented in 1931) and was subsequently licensed to a large number of companies for use in trucks, buses, tractors and cranes, as well as private cars and taxis. A Comet combustion chamber was used in the first Associated Equipment Company (AEC) diesel buses operated in 1931 by London General Omnibus Co, later part of the London Passenger Transport Board/London Transport. A later development of it featured in the world&#x27;s first volume production diesel passenger car, the 1934 Citroën Rosalie. This meant that Britain led the world in the field of high-speed diesels for road transport at that time. This advantage was lost to the United Kingdom as a result of the heavy tax imposed on diesel fuel in the budget of 1938.

Ricardo designed the 1921 T.T. Vauxhall engine which was described by Cecil Clutton in &quot;Motor Sport&quot; as a &quot;tour de force&quot; in the 1922 RAC T. T. O Payne in the Ricardo Vauxhall came 3rd, Jean Chassagne on a 1921 Grand Prix Sunbeam winning outright. The engine was later developed by Mays and Villiers, who fitted a supercharger, and was still a winner fifteen years later.

In 1922 and 1923 Ricardo published a two-volume work &quot;The Internal Combustion Engine&quot;.

Although Ricardo did not invent the sleeve valve, in 1927, he produced a seminal research paper that outlined the advantages of the sleeve valve, and suggested that poppet valve engines would not be able to offer power outputs much beyond 1500 hp (1,100 kW). A number of sleeve valve aircraft engines were developed following this paper, notably by Napier, Bristol and Rolls-Royce. Bristol produced the Perseus, Hercules, Taurus and the Centaurus, Napier produced the Napier Sabre, and Rolls-Royce produced the Eagle and Crecy, all using sleeve valves.

In 1929 Ricardo was elected Fellow of the Royal Society.

==World War II==
Ricardo&#x27;s work on the sleeve valve affected the development of British aircraft engines in the thirties and during the war. He enhanced the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine in the Mosquito by giving it an oxygen enrichment system to improve its performance.

Ricardo also assisted in the design of the combustion chambers and fuel control system of Sir Frank Whittle&#x27;s jet engine.

==Post war period==
In 1974, at the age of 89, Ricardo suffered a pelvic injury in a fall. He died six weeks later, on 18 May.
On 16 June 2005 a blue plaque was placed outside the house where Ricardo was born in Bedford Square, London. On 1 July 2010, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers bestowed an Engineering Heritage Award on Sir Harry Ricardo in recognition of his life and work as one of the foremost engineers of the twentieth century. The first internal combustion engine which Harry Ricardo designed and built as a schoolboy currently displays this Engineering Heritage plaque in the Ricardo plc company exhibition area.
==Ricardo PLC==

In 1915, Ricardo formed Engine Patents Ltd, the company which is today known as Ricardo PLC. In this year he was contacted by the Royal Naval Air Service to help with the design of a device to manoeuvre battle tanks into position aboard railway wagons. Around 8000 engines were produced to power the tanks, making this engine the UK&#x27;s first mass-produced internal combustion engine. Many more of these engines found further applications powering generators in workshops, hospitals and camps. The success of this venture yielded £30,000 in royalties and led to Ricardo being able to buy the land and set up the company on its present site in 1919.

<doc id="414984" wikidata="Q5472371" url="?curid=414984" title="Fort Wool">
<text>Fort Wool is a decommissioned island fortification located in the mouth of Hampton Roads, adjacent to the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel (HRBT). Officially known as Rip Raps Island, the fort has an elevation of 7 feet and sits near Old Point Comfort, Old Point Comfort Light, Willoughby Beach and Willoughby Spit, approximately one mile south of Fort Monroe.

Originally named Castle Calhoun or Fort Calhoun after Secretary of War John C. Calhoun, the fort was renamed after Maj. Gen. John Ellis Wool on 18 March 1862 during the American Civil War. It is noted on current nautical maps as &quot;Rip Raps&quot; and was sometimes referred to by that name during the Civil War.

Fort Wool was one of more than 40 forts developed after the War of 1812, when British forces sailed the Chesapeake Bay to burn the Capital. This program was later known as the third system of U.S. fortifications. Designed by Brigadier General of Engineers Simon Bernard, an expatriate Frenchman who had served as a general of engineers under Napoleon, Fort Wool was constructed on a shoal of ballast stones dumped as sailing ships entered Hampton&#x27;s harbor and was originally intended to have three tiers of casemates and a barbette tier with 216 muzzle-loading cannon, although it never reached this size. Only two-thirds of the fort&#x27;s bottom two tiers were completed. Fort Wool was built to maintain a crossfire with Fort Monroe, located directly across the channel, thereby protecting the entrance to the harbor.

In 1902, as a result of the Endicott Board&#x27;s findings, all of the original fort, except for eight casemates at the west end, was demolished and new fortifications were constructed. The new armament, mounted in three batteries of two 6-inch (152 mm) guns each, plus two batteries totaling six 3-inch (76 mm) guns, remained in place for decades, with modifications made from time to time. Only the six original three-inch guns remained in 1942, when two were sent to nearby Fort John Custis on Fisherman Island. A modern battery of two new long-range six-inch guns was constructed over one of the old Endicott period batteries during World War II but was never armed. The fort was decommissioned by the military in 1953.

==History==
===Design and construction===
Brigadier-General of Engineers Simon Bernard was tasked by Secretary of War John C. Calhoun to create or improve fortifications for the protection of vital U.S. ports. Bernard&#x27;s plan was to build more than forty new forts, including Fort Wool, which he had named Fort Calhoun. The fort was to have three tiers of casemates and a barbette tier with a total of 216 muzzle-loading cannon mounted, and was to be manned by a garrison of 1,000 soldiers. With four tiers, it was planned as the first &quot;tower fort&quot; of the third system, resembling the four-tier Castle Williams in New York harbor. Early plans called it &quot;Castle Calhoun&quot;. The fort was effectively a sea fort, as the island had to be built up considerably to accommodate it. The fort was planned as a shallow &quot;V&quot; shape pointing north, with rounded ends. It was to be built on a artificial island southeast of Old Point Comfort in Hampton, Virginia. Construction got underway in 1819 when crews started dumping granite boulders into the water. It took four years to bring the rock pile up to the 6-foot-tall island called for in the plans, and three more years before the foundation was ready to begin the fort&#x27;s construction.

Construction of the fort began in 1826, and after considerable delays caused by subsidence of the island, two-thirds of the first level of casemates was finally completed in 1830. Construction continued through 1834, and only half of the second tier was completed. It was then found that Fort Calhoun&#x27;s foundations had continued settling. Reports to the chief of engineers repeatedly state that the island had stabilized and construction could continue &quot;the next year&quot;. In fact, the island continues to settle in the early 21st century. A young second lieutenant and engineer in the U.S. Army, Robert E. Lee was transferred there to assist Captain Andrew Talcott, the U.S. Army engineer in charge of the construction of Fort Wool and its larger companion Fort Monroe, across the channel on the mainland. Lee was given the task of stabilizing the island as his first independent command. He found that the island would not hold the weight of the two tiers of casemates and brought more stone in to stabilize it, but the fort never reached its intended size. Lee found the stone foundation under the fort was the problem and that it could not support the weight of four tiers of the completed fort.

Work on the structure began again in 1858, but the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 brought the fort&#x27;s construction to a halt, with one complete tier and one open-top tier of casemates on about two-thirds of the designed perimeter. The south-facing &quot;gorge&quot; or back of the fort remained open.

===Civil War===

The fort was originally named after John C. Calhoun, President Monroe&#x27;s secretary of war who was a Southern politician of secessionist tendencies. In 1862 it was renamed after Maj. Gen. John Ellis Wool, a Mexican War hero and commander at Fort Monroe. The fort was armed during the Civil War, initially with only 10 guns, and fired on Confederate positions and vessels.
A long-range experimental cannon, the Sawyer gun, was installed at Fort Calhoun in mid-1861 during the Civil War. The weapon was rifled, and an illustration in an August 1861 newspaper shows it mounted on a high-angle carriage. The range of this weapon extended all the way to Sewell&#x27;s Point, more than three miles away (where the Norfolk Naval Base is now located), the site of a Confederate earthen fort with bastions and a redan and three artillery batteries totaling 45 guns. The weapon was a rifled 24-pounder (which would fire a projectile of 42–48 pounds), one of several rifled artillery pieces developed by Sylvanus Sawyer; however, none of his designs were widely adopted. A weapon of this type was tested at Fort Monroe in 1859, and two different Sawyer weapons, a 24-pounder rifle and a 3.67-inch, were used in the Siege of Richmond of 1864–65, although the 24-pounder burst at the tenth round and the 3.67-inch rifle was seldom used. The Battle of Hampton Roads took place off Sewells Point on March 8–9, 1862. USS &quot;Monitor&quot; faced CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; during the Battle of the Ironclads in 1862. The Sawyer gun also fired at &quot;Virginia&quot;, although it did no damage to the ironclad&#x27;s armor.

===Endicott batteries===
In 1885 the Endicott board met to recommend improvements to U.S. coast defenses. At Fort Wool the result was the demolition of all but a small part of the western end of the fort to make room for modern gun emplacements. Five gun batteries were constructed after 1902. Fort Wool was armed with relatively small-caliber, rapid-fire guns because Fort Monroe had numerous large-caliber weapons. The 3-inch guns were intended to defend controlled underwater minefields against minesweepers. Some of the mines (called &quot;torpedoes&quot; at the time) were stored at Fort Wool; the mines were controlled from Fort Monroe.
* Battery Ferdinand Claiborne: two guns on disappearing carriages (1908-1918)
* Battery Alexander Dyer: two guns on disappearing carriages (1908-1917)
* Battery Horatio Gates: two guns on disappearing carriages (1908-1942)
* Battery Henry Lee: four rapid-fire guns (1905-1943)
* Battery Jacob Hindman: two rapid-fire guns (1905-1946)

===World War I===

In 1917 and 1918, all but two of the six-inch guns were removed for potential use as field guns on the Western Front, along with their disappearing carriages. The remaining guns were shifted from Battery Claiborne to Battery Gates.
* Battery Horatio Gates: two guns on disappearing carriages (1908-1942)
* Battery Henry Lee: four rapid-fire guns (1905-1943)
* Battery Jacob Hindman: two rapid-fire guns (1905-1946)
* Anti-submarine nets were stretched across the harbor between Fort Wool and Fort Monroe in both world wars.

===World War II===

Battery 229 with two shielded guns on long-range carriages was constructed on a rebuilt Battery Horatio Gates from March 1943 to January 1944. The work was completed, and the shielded carriages were installed; however, the gun tubes were not mounted. On 30 September 1943, installation was completed on an SCR-296A radar to provide fire control for Battery 229. The previous 6-inch guns were scrapped in 1942–43. Battery Lee&#x27;s four 3-inch guns were transferred to Fort Story, two each in 1942 and 1943. Anti-submarine nets were stretched across the harbor between Fort Wool and Fort Monroe in both world wars.

In 1946 Battery Hindman&#x27;s pair of 3-inch guns were transferred to Fort Monroe as a saluting battery.

==Decommissioning and present==
The fort was decommissioned in 1953 and given to the Commonwealth of Virginia. In the 1950s, the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel (HRBT) was constructed next to Fort Wool, with its southern island connected to the fort by an earthen causeway. The HRBT opened to traffic in 1957. In 1967 and again in 1970, the city of Hampton developed the fort into a park, accessed by the passenger ferry &quot;Miss Hampton II&quot;. The fort can also be seen by westbound vehicles on approach to the HRBT southern tunnel, which carries Interstate 64 across the mouth of Hampton Roads.

The island, now called Rip Raps, continues to settle, and occasionally the casemates of the original fortress are off-limits for safety reasons. On 28 April 2007, a garrison flag was raised over Fort Wool for the first time. This took place during a parade of tall ships sailing past the fort, part of the 400th anniversary celebrations of the settlement of Jamestown. In 2020 the fort was converted into a bird sanctuary, and routine public access was terminated.

<text>Bugs and Thugs is a 1954 Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on March 13, 1954, and stars Bugs Bunny, with Rocky and Mugsy. The film is a semi-remake of the 1946 cartoon &quot;Racketeer Rabbit&quot;. It is also the first Warner Bros short to feature Milt Franklyn as a musical director.

In the film, Bugs mistakes the getaway car of a bank robber for a taxi and enters it uninvited, being taken hostage as a result.

==Reception==
Jerry Beck writes, &quot;A remake of director Friz Freleng&#x27;s earlier crime classic &quot;Racketeer Rabbit&quot; (1946), which featured caricatures of Edward G. Robinson and Peter Lorre as the gangsters, &quot;Bugs and Thugs&quot; is faster and funnier, has a great modern design (thanks to Hawley Pratt&#x27;s layouts), and introduces two great new foils — Rocky and Mugsy — for Bugs Bunny.&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;Bugs and Thugs&quot; is available on the following DVDs:

* &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1&quot;
* &quot;Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 3&quot;
* &quot;Looney Tunes Centerstage: Volume 2&quot;

<doc id="414986" wikidata="Q337575" url="?curid=414986" title="Richard Younger-Ross">
<text>Richard Alan Younger-Ross (born Richard Alan Ross, 29 January 1953) is a politician in England. He was the Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament (MP) for Teignbridge from 2001 to 2010, having contested the seat in 1992 and 1997, finally winning in the 2001 election. He was defeated in the redefined Newton Abbot constituency in 2010 election. In 2013 he fought and won the Devon County Council seat of Teignmouth Town, but four years later, on 4 May 2017, he lost his seat to Sylvia Russell, a Conservative, by just 22 votes.

==Early life==
Richard Younger-Ross was born in Surrey in 1953. He attended Walton County Secondary School for Boys, Brooklands Technical College in Weybridge, then Ewell Technical College. He studied at Oxford Polytechnic, now Oxford Brookes University. Before becoming a politician, he was an architectural consultant.

His first, unsuccessful, candidacy for Parliament was at Chislehurst in 1987.

==Parliamentary career==
He was a member of the Defence Select Committee and was the Lib Dem Spokesperson for Heritage.

In 2003, he voted against parliamentary approval for the invasion of Iraq.

He was a member of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee between 2005 and 2008.

In 2005, he proposed amendments to the Water Bill to create a water charge equalisation scheme to reduce the very high costs of water in the South West. This proposal is being considered by the Government following the Walker Report.

In 2006, Younger-Ross proposed a Ten Minute Rule Bill restricting Sunday trading hours in the UK for shops, arguing that without such legislation the British people would lose &quot;rhythm of life&quot; (House of Commons Debate, 24 May 2006). He is a member of the Beveridge Group.

In 2007, Younger-Ross was one of the last Liberal Democrat MPs to have the chance to question Tony Blair during Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions. Rather than asking a topical or newsworthy question, Younger-Ross chose to ask an esoteric question about disestablishmentarianism, prompting the response from Blair, &quot;I am really not bothered about that one.&quot; Also in 2007, he tabled an Early Day Motion calling for changes to the voting system of the Eurovision Song Contest, arguing that countries voted for their neighbours rather than the best songs. The UK finished second from the bottom in the 2007 contest, receiving votes only from Ireland and Malta.

In 2008 he proposed that Park Home Site owners should be &quot;fit and proper people&quot;, a proposal currently being consulted on by the Government.

==Personal life==
Younger-Ross moved to Teignmouth, Devon in 1989, with his wife, Susan Younger, whom he married in 1982 in Oxford. He is a Roman Catholic, attending a church in Teignmouth.

==Expenses==
On 16 May 2009, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; released details of several of Younger-Ross&#x27;s parliamentary expense claims. The disclosures were part of the newspaper&#x27;s wider disclosure of expenses of British Members of Parliament.

Younger-Ross was reported to have claimed more than £1200 for 5 mirrors to furnish his London flat, on which the rent was £1566 per month. A further £1475 was claimed for a single chest of drawers. These claims were submitted and approved by the Fees Office despite the fact that it was in excess of the so-called &quot;John Lewis List&quot;. It was not issued to MPs but stated that MPs should not spend more than £500 on chests of drawers or more than £300 on a mirror. The Telegraph interpreted the claims as excessive, stating that they were &quot;in clear breach of guidelines that state members must not use public funds&quot; for &quot;antique or luxury&quot; goods. When questioned on Sky TV, he apologised saying that perceptions of what was luxury depended on your background and income, &quot;clearly we have got it wrong&quot;.

On 21 March 2010, Younger-Ross was forced to apologise and pay £4,000 to Parliament after breaching commons rules over a payment he accepted relating to his second home. Younger-Ross had accepted £8,000 windfall money from the new landlord of his second home in Dolphin Square, London. In a letter to Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chairman of the Standards and Privileges Committee, Mr Younger-Ross said: &quot;I wholly accept the report and its conclusions and unreservedly apologise.&quot; MPs had been told they could accept this payment by the fees office. Many MPs profited from using the allowance to assist them buying a home, the House of Commons considered this to be acceptable although they may profit by tens of thousands of pounds on the sale of the property.

Subsequent to this, the Telegraph reported that a number of MPs had secretly requested refunds of their initially repaid expense claims after demands received from the House of Commons were lower than expected. Mr Younger-Ross received the fourth largest refund, an amount of £3,170.92, thereby effectively negating the entirety of his initial payment.

==Hunting==
Younger-Ross had a mixed voting record on hunting, rebelling against his party whips and voting against the fox hunting ban during the amendment stage of the bill and earlier abstaining on the key vote. He argued that although he disliked hunting, he would not vote for a ban which did not compensate those who had legitimately made a living from it. Two wrongs do not make a right he said.

==Penal Reform==
Younger-Ross is a member of the Howard League for Penal Reform.

<doc id="414987" wikidata="Q1234489" url="?curid=414987" title="Green Party (Brazil)">
<text>The Green Party (, PV) is a political party in Brazil. It was constituted after the military dictatorship period when limitations on party development were lifted, and, like other green parties around the world, is committed to establishing a set of policies on ensuring social equity and sustainable development. One of the party&#x27;s founding members was the journalist and former anti-dictatorship revolutionary Fernando Gabeira (a federal deputy between 1995 and 2011), Alfredo Sirkis and Carlos Minc. The founding of the Rio de Janeiro section of the Brazilian Green Party was led by a delegation from the southern Brazilian state of Santa Catarina, composed among others by Olga Maria Carvalho Luz, Luiz Henrique Gevaerd Odebrecht, Marcos Bayer, and Consuelo Luz Lins.

==Platform==

Among the main items on PV&#x27;s agenda are federalism, environmentalism, human rights, a form of direct democracy, parliamentarism, welfare, civil liberties, pacifism and marijuana legalization under specific conditions. That being said, their four main pillars are defined as ecological sustainability, grassroots democracy, social justice, and nonviolence. 

The party, however, argues to be in a position on the political spectrum that supposedly goes beyond the issue &quot;left-right&quot;, considered by its members to be anachronistic and unrealistic. Many critics also believe that the party broke the limit not to be a small party set in the context of the &quot;legends of rent&quot; (used by political parties only to be elected). This image is rejected by one of the theoreticians of the party, Tibor Rabóczkay, in the book &quot;Rethinking the Brazilian Green Party&quot;, with the argument that the going round and round between legends is so common in the big parties, as in the small ones. The author, however, acknowledges that in the effort to achieve the 5% barrier imposed by the barrier clause (&quot;law of exclusion policy&quot; in the words of Rabóczkay), the Green Party has opened its doors to politicians who are not concerned with ecological issues and consequently, tend to be amorphous benches from the green.

==History==
The Green Party was established in January 1986. It was founded by environmentalists and other activists from social movements, taking as their most expressive leaders Carlos Minc, who soon returned to the PT, Fernando Gabeira, Alfredo Sirkis, Domingos Fernandes, Jose Luiz de France Penna, and Mr. Sarney Filho.

At the last legislative elections, 3 October 2010, the party won 15 out of 513 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and no out of 81 seats in the Senate.

After Lula&#x27;s election as president of Brazil in 2002, the Green Party was assigned the Ministry of Culture, to which pop singer Gilberto Gil was appointed.

In the 2010 presidential election, the Green Party candidate Marina Silva gained 19.3% of the vote, thus contributing to Dilma Rousseff&#x27;s failure to gain 50% of the votes, making a run-off election necessary.

In the 2014 presidential election PV candidate Eduardo Jorge, who obtained 0,61% of votes, and elected 6 Deputies and 1 senator. The party voted in favor of the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff. The party later went to support president Michel Temer.

In May 2016 PV withdrew its support to Temer and went into crossbench.

For the Brazilian general election of 2018 the party formed with Sustainability Network the coalition &quot;United to transform Brazil&quot;, in support of the candidacy of Marina Silva.

In 2022, the party formed with the Workers Party and the Communist Party of Brazil to form the federation Brazil of Hope in preparation of the 2022 Brazilian general election. Also in 2022, in the upcoming presidential elections, the party supported the pre-candidacy of Lula da Silva to form the coalition Let&#x27;s go together for Brazil.

===Green Party in São Paulo===
The party is divided in the state in 21 river basins, where the capital are 4 basins – The Watershed are the regional governments of PV in the state of São Paulo. They are bringing together the municipal executive of the party. The state chairman of the party, provisionally, is Belizário Marcos and the chairman of the municipal capital is Galeão Carlos Camacho.

==Representation in government==
The party is not a major political force in the country, unlike some of its similar Europeans (such as Alliance 90/The Greens in Germany). For a long time its sole representative in Congress was the National Deputy Federal Fernando Gabeira, elected by Rio de Janeiro (1995–1998, 1999–2002; after brief period in Workers Party, Gabeira returned to PV in 2005). During twenty-eight months, beginning in 2003, the party formed the basis of support for Lula&#x27;s government, breaking up in the second half of May 2005, after stating general dissatisfaction with the environmental policies of the government. Gilberto Gil, the former Minister of Culture in Lula&#x27;s government is nonetheless a member of the party, and President of National PV is the Potiguar Jose Luiz de France Penna, which succeeded the former councilor Rio Alfredo Sirkis, a former Municipal Secretary of Environment and Municipal Secretary of Urbanism of Rio de Janeiro (also former candidate for President of the Republic by PV in 1998), in different administrations of Cesar Maia. Another ticket highlight is deputy Zequinha Sarney, of Maranhao, former Minister of the Environment in the government Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The party also differs from similar Europeans in low turnover in partisan positions and accumulation of power in the hands of relatively few people. In the meantime, it is equal to the other Brazilian political associations.

After the aggregation of votes, on 3 October 2006, the Green Party reached 3.6% of valid votes, with 3,368,560 valid votes.

In 2007, the National Convention was held in Brasília – DF, marked by legal challenges and complaints about the misuse of the Fund Partidário. Justice has come to stop the vote, guaranteed by point. Some critics of the administration of Penna in national PV were threatened with expulsion or expelled, as Paulo Moraes and Francis of Assisi (ex-pres. The PV / RJ). Complaints pass and the TSE evaluates suspend the fund of the party in 2008. Mr. Gabeira also speaks about reviewing the program&#x27;s subtitle, which has since been widely criticized in the media.

<doc id="414989" wikidata="Q430172" url="?curid=414989" title="Agathyrsi">
<text>The Agathyrsi were an ancient people belonging to the Scythian cultures who lived in the Transylvanian Plateau, in the region that later became Dacia. The Agathyrsi are largely known from Herodotus of Halicarnassus&#x27;s description of them in the 5th century BC.

== Name ==
The name is the Latinisation of the Ancient Greek name (), which was itself the Hellenized form of a Scythian name whose original form is not attested.

The linguist Alexis Manaster Ramer has reconstructed the original Scythian form of this name as &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;prospering the friend/&quot;, with the final part modified into , referring to the composite vegetal wand of Bacchus, in Greek because the ancient Greeks associated Scythian peoples with Bacchic rites.

== History ==
===Origins===
The arrival of the Agathyrsi in Europe was part of the larger process of westwards movement of Central Asian Iranic nomads towards Southeast and Central Europe which lasted from the 1st millennium BC to the 1st millennium AD, and to which also later participated other Iranic nomads such as the Cimmerians, Scythians, Sauromatians, and Sarmatians. The archaeological and historical records regarding these migrations are however scarce, and permit to sketch only a very broad outline of this complex development.

====Beginning of steppe nomadism====
The formation of genuine nomadic pastoralism itself happened in the early 1st millennium BC due to climatic changes which caused the environment in the Central Asian and Siberian steppes to become cooler and drier than before. These changes caused the sedentary mixed farmers of the Bronze Age to become nomadic pastoralists, so that by the 9th century BC all the steppe settlements of the sedentary Bronze Age populations had disappeared, and therefore led to the development of population mobility and the formation of warrior units necessary to protect herds and take over new areas.

These climatic conditions in turn caused the nomadic groups to become transhumant pastoralists constantly moving their herds from one pasture to another in the steppe, and to search for better pastures to the west, in Ciscaucasia and the forest steppe regions of western Eurasia.

====Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex====
The Agathyrsi originated as a section of the first wave of the nomadic populations who originated in the parts of Central Asia corresponding to eastern Kazakhstan or the Altai-Sayan region, and who had, beginning in the 10th century BC and lasting until the 9th to 8th centuries BC, migrated westwards into the Pontic-Caspian Steppe regions, where they formed new tribal confederations which constituted the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex.

Among these tribal confederations were the Agathyrsi in the Pontic Steppe, as well as the Cimmerians in the Caspian Steppe, and possibly the Sigynnae in the Pannonian Steppe. The archaeological and historical records regarding these migrations are however scarce, and permit to sketch only a very broad outline of this complex development.

The Agathyrsi thus corresponded to a part of the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex, to whose development three main cultural influences contributed to:
*present in the development of the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex is a strong impact of the native Bilozerka culture, especially in the form of pottery styles and burial traditions;
*the two other influences were of foreign origin:
**attesting of the Inner Asian origin, a strong material influence from the Altai, Aržan and Karasuk cultures from Central Asia and Siberia is visible in the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex of Inner Asian origin were especially dagger and arrowhead types, horse gear such as bits with stirrup-shaped terminals, deer stone-like carved stelae and Animal Style art;
**in addition to this Central Asian influence, the Kuban culture of Ciscaucasia also played an important contribution in the development of the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex, especially regarding the adoption of Kuban culture-types of mace heads and bimetallic daggers.
The Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex thus developed natively in the North Pontic region over the course of the 9th to mid-7th centuries BC from elements which had earlier arrived from Central Asia, due to which it itself exhibited similarities with the other early nomadic cultures of the Eurasian steppe and forest steppe which existed before the 7th century BC, such as the Aržan culture, so that these various pre-Scythian early nomadic cultures were thus part of a unified Aržan-Chernogorovka cultural layer originating from Central Asia.

Thanks to their development of highly mobile mounted nomadic pastoralism and the creation of effective weapons suited to equestrian warfare, all based on equestrianism, these nomads from the Pontic-Caspian Steppes were able to gradually infiltrate into Central and Southeast Europe and therefore expand deep into this region over a very long period of time, so that the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex covered a wide territory ranging from Central Europe and the Pannonian Plain in the west to Caucasia in the east, including present-day Southern Russia.

This in turn allowed the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex itself to strongly influence the Hallstatt culture of Central Europe: among these influences was the adoption of trousers, which were not used by the native populations of Central Europe before the arrival of the Central Asian steppe nomads.

===In the Pontic Steppe===

Within the western sections of the Eurasian Steppe, the Agathyrsi lived in the part of the Pontic Steppe situated on the northern shore of the Maeotian Sea, while their neighbours to the east, in the Ciscaucasian Steppe and the steppe regions to the north of the Caspian Sea were the Cimmerians, who themselves also belonged to the grouping of Iranic nomads of Central Asian origin belonging to the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex.

===Displacement of the Agathyrsi===
A second wave of migration of Iranic nomads corresponded arrival of the early Scythians from Central Asia into the Caucasian Steppe, which started in the 9th century BC, when a significant movement of the nomadic peoples of the Eurasian Steppe started after the early Scythians were expelled out of Central Asia by either the Massagetae, who were a powerful nomadic Iranic tribe from Central Asia closely related to the Scythians, or by another Central Asian people called the Issedones, thus forcing the early Scythians to the west, across the Araxes river and into the Caspian and Ciscaucasian Steppes.

This western migration of the early Scythians lasted through the middle 8th century BC, and archaeologically corresponded to the movement of a population originating from Tuva in southern Siberia in the late 9th century BC towards the west, and arriving in the 8th to 7th centuries BC into Europe, especially into Ciscaucasia, which it reached some time between and , thus following the same migration general path as the first wave of Central Asian Iranic nomads who had formed the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex.

The westward migration of the Scythians brought them to the lands of the Cimmerians, after which the Scythians settled between the Araxes river to the east, the Caucasus mountains to the south, and the Maeotian Sea to the west, in the Ciscaucasian Steppe where were located the Scythian kingdom&#x27;s headquarters.

The arrival of the Scythians corresponded to a disturbance of the development of the Cimmerian peoples&#x27; Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex, which was thus replaced over the course of to by the early Scythian culture in southern Europe, which itself nevertheless still showed links to the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex.

From their base in the Ciscaucasian Steppe, the Scythians over the course of the 8th to 7th centuries BC conquered the Pontic and Crimean Steppes to the north of the Black Sea up to the Istros river, whose mouth henceforth formed the western boundary of Scythian territory.

The conquest of their territories by the Scythians from the east pushed the Agathyrsi westwards, out of the Pontic Steppe, with the Scythians themselves replacing them as the main population of the Pontic Steppe, thus completing the process of the Scythians becoming the main dominant population of the Pontic-Steppe over the course of to . The Agathyrsi henceforth became the immediate neighbours of the Scythians to their west and the relations between these two tribes remained hostile.

===In the Balkans===
After their displacement, the Agathyrsi settled in the regions surrounding the Eastern Carpathian Mountains corresponding to the territories presently called Moldavia, Oltenia and Transylvania, although they also may have been one of the peoples who had free access to the Wallachian and Moldavian Plains along with the Scythians.

In these regions, the Agathyrsi established themselves as a ruling class over the indigenous population, who were Geto-Thracians, and intermarried with these local peoples and gradually assimilated into these local peoples&#x27; culture. And, beginning in the 6th century BC, the Agathyrsi were organising into fortified settlements, such as the ones at Stâncești and Cotnari, which acted as important centres of the Getae.

A section of the displaced Agathyrsi might also have migrated more southwards into Thrace proper, where a group of this people was located on the Haemus Mons by Stephanus of Byzantium.

====The Trausi====
Stephanus of Byzantium also suggested that a section of the Agathyrsi were present on the Rhodope Mountains by his mention that the Greeks referred to the Trausi (; , ) tribe who lived there as being Agathyrsi.

On the Rhodopes, the Trausi initially lived to the north-east of the Thracian tribe of the Bistones. By the early 2nd century BC, the Trausi had migrated to the east of the Hebrus river in the hinterland of Maroneia and Aenus, and they soon disappeared from history after being conquered by the kingdom of the Sapaei.

===Scythian influence===
In the 6th century BC, some splinter Scythian groups followed the earlier route of the nomads of the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk wave, passed through the passes of the Carpathian Mountains, and settled in the Pannonian Basin, where some of them settled in the territory of the Agathyrsi while others moved into the Pannonian Steppe and settled in the territory of the Sigynnae, and subsequently intermarried with the local populations while remaining in contact with the Pontic Steppe through trade.

These migrations and trade connections contributed to the transformation of the culture of the Agathyrsi and the Sigynnae into a more Scythian-like form.

==== Persian invasion of Scythia ====

In the late 6th century BC, the Achaemenid Persian Empire started expanding into Europe, beginning with the Persian annexation of all of Thrace, after which the Achaemenid king of kings Darius I crossed the Istros river in 513 BC and attacked the Scythian kingdom with an army of 700,000 to 800,000 soldiers, possibly with the goal of annexing it.

In response, the Scythian king Idanthyrsus summoned the kings of the peoples surrounding his kingdom to a council to decide how to deal with the Persian invasion. The Budini, Geloni and Sauromatians joined the Scythian-led alliance in resisting the Persian invasion, and Idanthyrsus led the joint forces of the Scythians and their allied neighbours in resisting the Persian invasion. Meanwhile, the Agathyrsi, Androphagi, Melanchlaeni, Neuri and Tauri refused to support the Scythians.

According to the Greek author Herodotus of Halicarnassus, during the campaign the fleeing Scythians and the Persian army pursuing them passed through the territories of the Melanchlaeni, Androphagi, and Neuri, before they reached the borders of the Agathyrsi, who refused to let the Scythian divisions to pass into their territories and find refuge there, thus forcing the Scythians to return to Scythia with the Persians pursuing them.

===Death of Ariapeithes===
At some point between and , Ariapeithes was killed by the Agathyrsian king Spargapeithes.

===Celtic immigration===
In the middle of the 5th century BC, the Hallstatt culture developed into the La Tène culture, whose people are identified with the Celts, who by the late 5th century BC were moving to the east along the upper Istros and initially settled in Transistria before moving into the Pannonian Steppe where lived the Sigynnae and later into the mountainous regions where lived the Agathyrsi. The relations between the Celtic incomers and the Iranic nomads appear to have remained peaceful, with the Celts later intermarrying with the local populations of the Pannonian Basin, thus exposing the Celts to the influence of the beliefs, practices and art styles of the steppe nomads so that motifs borrowed from and influenced by the steppe nomads started appearing in La Tène Celtic art.

Among these borrowed artistic influences were images of predatory carnivores, sometimes attacking herbivorous beasts, as well as motifs of pairs of animals facing each other, giving rise to Celtic motif of the &quot;dragon pairs&quot; which decorated the tops of Celtic sword scabbards. Another motif borrowed by Celtic art from steppe art are pairs of predatory birds around shield circular bosses, reflecting not only the mere artistic influence of the steppe nomads, but also of the borrowing by the Celts of Iranic steppe nomad belief systems expressed through the image of predatory beasts.

====Ethnogenesis of the Dacians====
The Agathyrsi were barely mentioned again in outside sources after Herodotus of Halicarnassus described them in the 5th century BC, and it is unknown for how long they were able to maintain their Agathyrsian identity. However, the Graeco-Roman author Claudius Ptolemy and an inscription from Rome, both from the middle of the 1st century AD, mentioned the Agathyrsi.

The Agathyrsi appear to have eventually become fully assimilated into the Geto-Thracian populations among whom they lived, and the Getic groups organised around the Agathyrsian fortified settlements eventually evolved into the Dacian culture, with a large part of the later Dacian people being consequently descended from the Agathyrsi. The Agathyrsi hence disappeared from history in a process typical of most Scythic peoples who back then formed the substrate of the many powerful tribal federations of the Ponto-Danubian region.

===Legacy===
The peoples of the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex of which the Agathyrsi were part of introduced the use of trousers into Central Europe, whose local native populations did not wear trousers before the arrival of the first wave of steppe nomads of Central Asian origin into Europe.

The role of the Agathyrsi as the oldest Scythic population of the Pontic Steppe was reflected in the Scythian genealogical myth of the Scythians proper, according to which Agathyrsus was the eldest of the three ancestors of the Scythian peoples born of the union of the god Targitaos and the Snake-Legged Goddess.

The displacement of the Agathyrsi by the Scythians is expressed in the genealogical myth by how the Snake-Legged Goddess banished her two eldest sons, Agathyrsus and Gelonus, from her country and instead crowned as king her youngest son, Scythes, who was the ancestor of the Scythians proper.

==Culture and society==
===Location===
====In the Pontic Steppe====
From the 9th to the late 8th or early 7th centuries BC, the Agathyrsi occupied the eastern sections of the Pontic Steppe on the northern shores of the Maeotian Sea.

The neighbours of the Agathyrsi to the east, in the Ciscaucasian Steppe and the steppe regions to the north of the Caspian Sea were the Cimmerians, who themselves also belonged to the grouping of Iranic nomads of Central Asian origin belonging to the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex and were therefore closely related to the Agathyrsi.

====In the Balkans====
At the time when the Greek historian Herodotus of Halicarnassus described them, in the 5th century BC, the Agathyrsi were living in the region which later became known as Dacia and is presently known as Transylvania, as well as in the region of the Carpathian Mountains and to their east and north of the Danube river where was located the source of the Maris river, that is in the regions corresponding to present-day Moldavia and Oltenia, and they may have been one of the peoples who had free access to the Wallachian and Moldavian Plains along with the Scythians.

The eastern neighbours of the Agathyrsi were the Pontic Scythians, while their northern neighbours were the Neuri, who were a Baltic population.

===Ethnicity===
By the time the Agathyrsi were living in the Balkans, they had become a people of mixed Scytho-Thracian origin, composed of a Geto-Thracian population with an Iranic-Scythic ruling class, as attested by how their kings, such as Agathyrsus and Spargapeithes, were Iranic.

The assimilation of the Scythic Agathyrsi into the Getic population of the areas they had settled in is attested by how their culture combined Iranic and Thracian elements.

===Social organisation===
Unlike the nomads of the Pontic Steppe, the Pannonian Basin nomads such as the Agathyrsi appear to not have possessed an elite class.

===Language===
Reflecting their Scythic origin, the names of the kings of Agathyrsi, such as Agathyrsus and Spargapeithes, were Iranic.

===Gender roles===
Herodotus of Halicarnassus claimed that the men of the Agathyrsi had their wives in common so that all of their people would be each other&#x27;s siblings and members of a single family living together without jealousy or hatred.

===Lifestyle===
====Dress====
The clothing of the Agathyrsi likely included the use of trousers, which was a typical part of steppe nomads&#x27; dress.

The Agathyrsi lived in luxury and wore gold jewellery.

====Hair dyeing====
The aristocracy of the Agathyrsi dyed their hair dark blue to distinguish themselves from the common people.

====Tattooing====
The Agathyrsi had followed Thracian customs such as tattooing, which the aristocracy of the Agathyrsi performed to distinguish themselves from the common people: the tattoos of the Agathyrsi consisted of checkered designs in blue-black ink on their faces and limbs, and their intensity, intricacy and vibrancy was proportional to their bearers&#x27; social status and the prestige of their lineage.

Tattooing was especially practised among Agathyrsi women.

====Religion====
According to Herodotus of Halicarnassus, the Agathyrsian tribe of the Trausi, who lived in southern Thrace, practised a custom which was unique among the peoples of all of Thrace: the relatives of newborns would sit around them and mourn all the misfortunes they would have to go through in life, and would celebrate with joy during funerals since they believed that death had instead brought happiness to the deceased by freeing them from the miseries of life.

====Other customs====
The Agathyrsi traditionally memorised their laws in song form.

==Archaeology==

To the early phase of the Agathyrsian presence in Transylvania belongs a cemetery from the 8th to 7th centuries BC at Stoicani.

In the 6th century BC, the populations of the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex of Central Europe came under Scythian influence, resulting in them becoming more Scythianised: the Agathyrsi thus corresponded to a local group of the Scythian culture located in Transylvania, around the valley of the Mures river, with scattered groups being present in areas of Romania and Bessarabia.

The archaeological remains of the Agathyrsi exhibited a unique character due to the absorption of Thracian elements by Iranic incomers, and consist of multiple hundred burials in the form of both cremations and inhumations: the inhumations were themselves buried in simple Scythian-type catacomb tombs, and the grave goods included Scythian-type weapon sets and jewellery from the 6th and 5th centuries BC. The pottery of the Agathyrsi was derived from traditions native to the Transylvanian region.

A related culture from the region of future Wallachia on the lower Danube was the Ferigile culture, to which belonged Scythian-type weapons, horse harnesses and pottery.

The Agathyrsi themselves corresponded to the archaeological culture which had created the fortified settlements of the Stincesti-Cotnari type in the 6th century BC. Objects found isolated or in graves in territories identifiable with the Agathyrsi are characteristic of the Scythian culture, and consist of:
*military gear such as:
**arrows,
**quivers,
**iron battle-axes,
**scale armour,
**shields;
*horse gear,
*personal accessories such as:
**bronze mirrors,
**pole-top rattles,
**bronze kettles,
**gold ornaments,
**and dress attachments.

<text>Joyce Gwendolen Quin, Baroness Quin, (born 26 November 1944), is a British Labour Party politician. She was a member of the European Parliament from 1979 to 1989, and served as the member of Parliament (MP) for Gateshead East and Washington West and for its predecessor Gateshead East from 1987 to 2005. Quin was appointed a life peer in 2006 and sat in the House of Lords until her retirement in 2024.

== Early life and career ==
Quin was educated at Whitley Bay Grammar School and Newcastle University, where she gained first-class honours in French and came top in her year. She subsequently gained an Master of Science (MSc) degree in international relations at the London School of Economics. She worked as a French language lecturer and tutor at the University of Bath and Durham University. Quin is the grand-niece of Labour Party politician Joshua Ritson (1874–1955).

She served as a member of the European Parliament for Tyne South and Wear and Tyne and Wear successively from 1979 to 1989. During her time as an MEP she served as Labour spokesperson on Fisheries from 1979 to 1984. She was a member of the Agriculture, Women&#x27;s Rights, Regional and Economic Affairs Committee. In 1979, she tabled the resolution to set up a Register of Members&#x27; Interests which was eventually accepted by the European Parliament.

== Member of Parliament ==
Quin entered the House of Commons in the 1987 election as Member of Parliament for Gateshead East. In Opposition (1987–1997) she served on the Labour front bench as a Shadow Minister for Consumer Affairs, Trade Policy, Regional Policy and Employment (dealing with the EU Social Chapter). From 1994 to 1997 she served as Shadow Europe Minister and was Deputy to Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.

After boundary changes for the 1997 general election, she represented the new Gateshead East and Washington West constituency from 1997 until she stepped down at the 2005 general election and was replaced by Sharon Hodgson. Quin served as prisons minister, Minister for Europe, and as Minister of State for Agriculture (and deputy to Cabinet Minister, Nick Brown). She asked to retire as a minister in 2001 to concentrate on her constituency interests. She had intended to stand for membership of a North East Regional Assembly on her retirement from Westminster, but the proposed body was rejected by a margin of 4–1 in a referendum in November 2004. In Parliament as a backbencher Quin was the first woman to chair the Northern Group of Labour MPs and Chaired the All-Party Group for France (Franco-British Parliamentary Group). She successfully lobbied Chancellor Gordon Brown to bring in the nationwide concessionary bus travel scheme for pensioners 

== Life peer ==
In April 2006, it was announced that Quin had been nominated for a life peerage by the Labour Party. On 30 May, she was created &quot;Baroness Quin, of Gateshead in the County of Tyne and Wear&quot;. Quin was appointed a shadow Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs minister by Harriet Harman in May 2010, and was retained in that role by Ed Miliband after his election as Leader of the Labour Party. She stood down from this position in July 2011.

In November 2007, Baroness Quin was appointed Chair of the Franco-British Council (British Section). In 2010 she was awarded &quot;Officier de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur&quot; by the French Government.

She was interviewed in 2014 as part of The History of Parliament&#x27;s oral history project.

Quin has volunteered as a Newcastle City Tourist Guide since 1976. She is President of the Northumbrian Pipers&#x27; Society (since 2009) and President of the Northumberland National Park Foundation (since 2016). Since September 2017 she has been Chair of the Strategic Board of Tyne and Wear Museums.

In 2010 Quin authored a book titled &quot;The British Constitution, Continuity and Change - An Inside View: Authoritative Insight into How Modern Britain Works&quot; 
 published by Northern Writers and is co-author of the book “Angels of the North - Notable Women of the North-East” with Moira Kilkenny, published 2018, reprinted 2019 by Tyne Bridge Publishing .

Quin retired from the House of Lords on 19 December 2024.

<text>Lawrence William Quinn (born 25 December 1956) is a British Labour Party politician, railway engineer and from 1997 to 2005 he was the member of parliament for Scarborough and Whitby.

==Early life and education==
Quinn was born in Harraby, a suburb of Carlisle, then in Cumberland. He attended Pennine Way Primary School and North Cumbria Technology College (then known as Harraby Comprehensive School) Harraby Comprehensive School. In 1979, at Hatfield Polytechnic, he gained a BSc in civil engineering.

Prior to his election to Parliament, he was a civil engineer with British Rail (1979–94) and Railtrack London North-East (1994–7), and a member of North Yorkshire County Council from 1989 to 1993.

==Parliamentary career==
From 1989 to 1993, Quinn was a Councillor on North Yorkshire County Council, serving on the Highways Committee, the Policy and Resources Committee and the Planning Committee.

He was elected to Parliament in the 1997 General Election as member of parliament for Scarborough and Whitby, as part of the Labour landslide election victory while he was not really expecting to win a normally Conservative seat which he retained in the 2001 General Election.

He sat for two terms until being ousted by Conservative candidate Robert Goodwill in the United Kingdom general election of 2005. Lawrie lost the seat by 1,245 votes. It has been suggested that votes for the local Liberal Democrat candidate, the Iraq war, and negative feeling towards Tony Blair (who visited Scarborough the day before polling day to consolidate support) resulted in the marginal loss.

Quinn is a member of the Fabian Society.

Since losing his seat he has returned to engineering, working as Tube Lines New Works Delivery Manager on secondment from Bechtel (2005 until 2007) then as the Rail Projects Delivery Manager for Bechtel based in London.

==Personal life==

<text>Archibald John Norman (born 1 May 1954) is a British businessman and politician. He is the only person to have been chairman of an FTSE 100 company and a Member of the House of Commons (MP) at the same time. From January 2010 to January 2016, Norman was the chairman of ITV plc. He succeeded Robert Swannell as chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer in September 2017.

==Early life and education==
Born the second of five sons of two doctors, Archie Norman was educated at Charterhouse, the University of Minnesota, Emmanuel College, Cambridge and (after a short period at Citigroup), at Harvard Business School, where he obtained an MBA.

==Career==

=== Business career ===
Norman joined McKinsey &amp; Company on graduation, where William Hague (future British Foreign Secretary) was one of his protégés. He was the youngest-ever partner at McKinsey aged 28. He then held directorships at Geest and Railtrack, before becoming group finance director at Britain&#x27;s then largest retailer, Kingfisher plc at 32. 

From 1991 until 1999, Norman was Chief Executive and then Chairman of Asda, the large supermarket chain, and with Allan Leighton, he is credited with turning it around, and making it the second largest in the United Kingdom, before its sale to Wal-Mart in July 1999.

In November 1999, he stepped down from the chain. In the early nineties, Norman was also chairman of The Children&#x27;s Trust, and in 1998, he was succeeded by Sir Brian Hill.

===Political career===
During the 1980s, Norman stood unsuccessfully as a Conservative candidate in council elections in Southwark, London. In 1996, on the advice of Francis Maude, Norman decided to apply for the Conservative safe seat of Tunbridge Wells, soon to be vacated by Sir Patrick Mayhew.

Norman was elected as Conservative Member of Parliament for Tunbridge Wells in England, at the 1997 General Election, with a majority of 7,506. In December 1996, Labour warned that people voting for Norman would be short-changed, as he believed that being an MP was not a full-time job.

After the heavy Conservative defeat at the 1997 election, Norman supported William Hague&#x27;s bid for leadership, becoming Chief Executive of the Conservative Party from July 1998 to June 1999. As Chief Executive he rationalised staffing at Conservative Central Office in Smith Square, sacking a third of the staff. He also proposed in a &quot;Blueprint for change&quot; plan that the election of party leader should be decided by party members, rather than MPs, and there should be a target of doubling membership.

He served as a shadow minister for the environment in 1999. From February 2000 to September 2001 he was Shadow Secretary of State for Environment, Transport and the Regions, where he was up against John Prescott on the Labour front bench.

In September 2001, after leaving the Shadow Cabinet, he founded the think tank Policy Exchange with Francis Maude. In July 2002, Norman became Chairman of Energis, having led a consortium of banks in the purchase and refinancing of the United Kingdom arm of Energis from the administrators. In October 2004, he announced his intention to step down as MP at the next general election, as he wished to pursue other interests.

In December 2004, Greg Clark was selected as the candidate to succeed him by the Conservative Party. In May 2005, Norman officially stood down as MP, prior to the general election.

In October 2016, Norman was appointed by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy as its Lead Non Executive Board Member, with Clark as Secretary of State.

===Return to business===
On leaving Parliament, Norman set up Aurigo Management, a private equity firm primarily focussed on retail/consumer industries. In February 2004, he showed interest in becoming the chairman of Sainsbury&#x27;s. In June 2005, he denied plans to take over the helm of Morrisons. In July 2007, Aurigo bought tool hire retailer HSS Hire for £310 million, from 3i. In November 2007, Norman advised Wesfarmers on the acquisition of Coles Group, and has since overseen the turnaround of Coles in Australia.

On 18 November 2009, Norman was named as the new chairman of ITV plc. In January 2016, it was announced he was to step down as chairman after six years. In July 2013, Lazard appointed him as its London chairman, as the firm worked on the privatisation of the Royal Mail. In December 2013, he was appointed chairman of Hobbycraft, replacing Simon Burke.

On 5 May 2017, it was announced Norman would succeed Robert Swannell as chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer in September 2017.

==Other==
He is on the Board of the NIESR, has an Honorary Degree from Leeds Metropolitan University, was a Director of the Judge Institute, has been elected to the Marketing Society Hall of Fame, and been voted Retailer of the Year and Yorkshire Businessman of the Year. In December 2010, he was granted the &quot;Institute of Turnaround Professional Lifetime Achievement Award&quot;. In June 2015, he teamed up with &quot;The X Factor&quot; host Simon Cowell in launching a new show, entitled &quot;The F Factor&quot;.

==Personal life==
Married with one daughter, he has homes in Yorkshire, London and the small island of Lismore on the west coast of Scotland. His interests include farming, opera, fishing and tennis. He bought a pied-à-terre in Tunbridge Wells while MP.

In July 2004, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported he owned a REVA G-Wiz to commute around London, and outside London, he drove a Volkswagen Golf.

<doc id="414999" wikidata="Q127337" url="?curid=414999" title="I Dream of Jeannie">
<text>I Dream of Jeannie is an American fantasy sitcom television series created by Sidney Sheldon and starring Barbara Eden as a beautiful but guileless 2,000-year-old genie and Larry Hagman as an astronaut with whom she falls in love and eventually marries. Produced by Screen Gems, the show originally aired for 139 episodes over five seasons, from September 18, 1965, to May 26, 1970, on NBC.

== Plot ==
In the pilot episode, &quot;The Lady in the Bottle&quot;, astronaut Captain Tony Nelson, United States Air Force, is on a space flight when his one-man capsule &quot;Stardust One&quot; comes down far from the planned recovery area, near a deserted island in the South Pacific. On the beach, Tony notices a strange bottle that rolls by itself. When he rubs it after removing the stopper, smoke spews from it and a beautiful Persian-speaking female genie materializes and surprises Tony by kissing him.

They cannot understand each other until Tony expresses his wish that &quot;Jeannie&quot; could speak English, which she then does. Then, per his instructions, she &quot;blinks&quot; and causes a recovery helicopter to show up to rescue Tony, who is so grateful he tells her she is free. But Jeannie, who has already fallen in love with Tony after being trapped for 2,000 years, re-enters her bottle and rolls it into Tony&#x27;s duffel bag so she can accompany him back home.

In an early episode, Jeannie helps to break up Tony&#x27;s engagement to his commanding general&#x27;s daughter, Melissa, who, along with the general, is never seen or mentioned again. Producer Sidney Sheldon decided against preserving the romantic triangle as a regular plot theme.

At first Tony keeps Jeannie in her bottle most of the time, but he finally relents and allows her to enjoy a life of her own. However, her life is devoted mostly to his, and most of their problems stem from either Jeannie&#x27;s love for him or her often-misguided efforts to please him. She continues in her attempts, unbothered by Tony&#x27;s obvious preference to do things for himself. Jeannie&#x27;s magical mischief—and Tony&#x27;s efforts to cover it up—constantly put him under the scrutiny of NASA&#x27;s resident psychiatrist (and Tony&#x27;s commanding officer), Colonel Dr. Alfred Bellows. A running theme throughout the series has Bellows as the only eyewitness to Jeannie&#x27;s antics while Tony (and sometimes his best friend and fellow astronaut, United States Army captain and later major, Roger Healey) are also present. Tony offers far-fetched explanations to Bellows, who then tries to prove to his superior officers that Tony is either crazy or hiding something. But his efforts typically backfire and in the end his superiors never buy them. And, after Bellows is invariably foiled, he proclaims, &quot;He&#x27;s done it to me again!&quot;

Another frequently used plot device is Jeannie&#x27;s loss of her powers when she is confined in a closed space. For example, she&#x27;s unable to leave her bottle when it is corked, and under certain circumstances the next person who removes the cork becomes her new master. A multiple-episode story arc revolves around a miniature Jeannie&#x27;s becoming trapped in a NASA safe when it&#x27;s accidentally locked.
For the first 16 episodes, Roger is unaware of Jeannie&#x27;s existence in Tony&#x27;s life, although they meet in episode 12. When Roger finds out she is a genie, he steals her bottle, thereby becoming her new master. Though Roger is good-natured he&#x27;s somewhat girl-crazy and often schemes to achieve a vain or selfish gain. He occasionally has hopes of becoming Jeannie&#x27;s master so he can exploit her powers for selfish ends, but he&#x27;s generally respectful of the relationship between Tony and Jeannie. Tony and Roger are both promoted to the rank of major late in the first season. In later seasons, Roger&#x27;s role is retconned to portray him as having known about Jeannie from the beginning (i.e., as his having been with Tony on the space flight whose touch down led to their discovering Jeannie).

Jeannie&#x27;s evil twin sister, mentioned in a second-season episode (also named Jeannie—since, as Barbara Eden&#x27;s character explains it, all female genies are named &quot;Jeannie&quot;—and also portrayed by Barbara Eden in a brunette wig), proves to be scheming and underhanded starting in the third season (as in her initial appearance in &quot;Jeannie or the Tiger?&quot;), repeatedly trying to steal Tony for herself and to make herself Tony&#x27;s real &quot;master&quot;. Her final attempt in the series comes shortly after Tony and Jeannie are married, with a ploy involving a man played by Barbara Eden&#x27;s real-life husband at the time, Michael Ansara. (In a kind of in-joke, while Jeannie&#x27;s sister pretends to be attracted to him, she privately scoffs at him.)

Early in the fifth season, Jeannie is called upon by her uncle Sully (Jackie Coogan) to become queen of their family&#x27;s native country, Basenji. Tony inadvertently gives grave offense to Basenji national pride regarding their feud with neighboring Kasja. To regain favor, Tony is required by Sully to marry Jeannie and to avenge Basenji&#x27;s honor by killing the ambassador from Kasja when he visits NASA. After Sully manages to put suspicion on Tony for various assassination attempts on the ambassador, Tony responds in a fit of anger that he is fed up with Sully and his cohorts and that he would not marry Jeannie even if she were &quot;the last genie on earth&quot;. Hearing this, Jeannie despairs, leaves Tony and returns to Basenji. With Jeannie gone, Tony realizes how deeply he loves her. He flies to Basenji to win Jeannie back. Upon their return, Tony introduces Jeannie as his fiancée. She dresses as a modern American woman in public (as she had in multiple previous episodes). This changed the show&#x27;s premise: now the object is to hide Jeannie&#x27;s magical abilities rather than her existence.

== Production ==

=== Background ===
The series was created and produced by Sidney Sheldon in response to the great success of rival network ABC&#x27;s &quot;Bewitched&quot; series, which had debuted in 1964 as the second-most watched program in the United States. Sheldon, inspired by the 1964 film &quot;The Brass Bottle&quot;, conceived of the idea for a beautiful female genie. Both &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; and &quot;Bewitched&quot; were Screen Gems productions.

When casting was opened for the role of Jeannie, producer Sidney Sheldon could not find an actress who could play the role the way that he had written it. He did have one specific rule: he did not want a blonde genie, because the similarity with the blonde witch on &quot;Bewitched&quot; would be too much. However, after many unsuccessful auditions, he called Barbara Eden&#x27;s agent. Eden had coincidently co-starred in &quot;The Brass Bottle&quot; as mortal Sylvia Kenton.

The show debuted on Saturday, September 18, 1965, at 8 pm on NBC. When NBC began broadcasting most of its prime-time television lineup in color in the fall of 1965, &quot;Jeannie&quot; was one of two programs that remained in black and white, in its case because of the special photographic effects employed to achieve Jeannie&#x27;s magic. By the second season, however, further work had been done on techniques to create the visual effects in color, which was necessary because by 1966, all prime-time series in the United States were being made in color.

Sheldon originally wanted to film season one in color, but NBC did not want to pay for the extra expenses, as the network (and Screen Gems) believed the series would not make it to a second season. Sheldon offered to pay the extra $400 an episode needed for color filming at the beginning of the series, but Screen Gems executive Jerry Hyams advised him: &quot;Sidney, don&#x27;t throw your money away.&quot;

=== Opening sequence ===
The first few episodes after the pilot (episodes two through eight) used a nonanimated, expository opening narrated by Paul Frees; the narration mentions that Nelson lived in &quot;a mythical town&quot; named Cocoa Beach in &quot;a mythical state called Florida&quot;. The remaining episodes of that first season featured an animated sequence that was redone and expanded in season two, when the show switched from black and white to color. This new sequence, used in seasons 2–5, featured a retelling of the initial meeting in the pilot episode, with Captain Nelson&#x27;s space capsule splashing down on the beach, and Jeannie dancing out of her bottle (modified to reflect its new decoration) and then kissing Nelson before the bottle sucks her back in at the end. Both original versions of the show&#x27;s animated opening sequence were created by animator Friz Freleng.

=== Setting ===
Although the series was set in and around what was then known as Cape Kennedy, Florida, and Major Nelson lived at 1020 Palm Drive in nearby Cocoa Beach, locations in California were used in place of those in Florida. The exterior of the building where he and Major Healey had offices was actually the main building at the NASA Flight Research Center (renamed as the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center in March 1976 and as the Armstrong Flight Research Center in 2014) at Edwards Air Force Base, north of Los Angeles. &quot;If you look at some of those old [episodes], it&#x27;s supposed to be shot in Cocoa Beach, but in the background you have mountains — the Hollywood Hills,&quot; Bill Daily said. In actuality, the home of Major Nelson (also used as the Anderson house in &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;, and then the home of Mr. Wilson in &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;) was filmed at the Warner Bros. Ranch, in Burbank (on Blondie Street). Many exteriors were filmed at this facility. Interior filming was done at the Sunset Gower Studios (the original Columbia Pictures studio lot) in Hollywood.

The cast and crew only made two visits to Florida&#x27;s Space Coast, both in 1969. On June 27, a parade in Cocoa Beach escorted Eden and the rest of the cast to Cocoa Beach City Hall, where she was greeted by fans and city officials. They were then taken to LC-43 at Cape Canaveral where she pressed a button to launch a Loki-Dart weather rocket. They had dinner at Bernard&#x27;s Surf, where Eden was given the state of Florida&#x27;s Commodore Award for outstanding acting. Later, the entourage went to Lee Caron&#x27;s Carnival Club, where Eden was showered with gifts and kissed astronaut Buzz Aldrin on the cheek, just two weeks before the Apollo 11 launch.
The cast and crew returned on November 25, 1969, for three days for a mock wedding of Eden and Hagman staged for television writers from around the nation (timed to the airing of the nuptials episode on December 2) at the Patrick Air Force Base Officers Club. Then-Florida Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr., attended and cut the cake for the couple.

Eden returned 27 years later, in July 1996, as a featured speaker for Space Days at the Kennedy Space Center. Cocoa Beach Mayor Joe Morgan presented her an &quot;I Dream of Jeannie Lane&quot; street sign, later installed on a short street off Florida State Road A1A near Lori Wilson Park.

On September 15, 2005, the area held a &quot;We Dream of Jeannie&quot; festival, including a Jeannie lookalike contest. Plans for one in 2004 were interrupted by Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Jeanne. However, a Jeannie lookalike contest was held in 2004, with Bill Daily attending.

On August 24, 2012, Cocoa Beach City leaders honored the show with a roadside plaque outside Lori Wilson Park.

=== Jeannie&#x27;s origin ===

In the first season, Jeannie clearly was originally a human who was turned into a genie by (as later revealed Season 1, Episode 2: &quot;My Hero?&quot;) the Blue Djinn when she refused to marry him (the term &quot;djinn&quot; is synonymous with &quot;genie&quot;). Several members of Jeannie&#x27;s family, including her parents, are rather eccentric, but none is a genie. Her mother describes the family as &quot;just peasants from the old country&quot; (Season 1, Episode 14, &quot;What House Across the Street?&quot;). The Blue Djinn was played by Barbara Eden&#x27;s first husband, Michael Ansara. In later seasons, he also played King Kamehameha (Season 3, Episode 15 &quot;The Battle of Waikiki&quot;), and Biff Jellico (Season 5, Episode 12 &quot;My Sister, the Homewrecker&quot;).

The topic of Jeannie&#x27;s originally being human is restated in season two during the episode &quot;How to be a Genie in 10 Easy Lessons&quot;. Jeannie mentions that she has a sister who is a genie, but the phrasing—&quot;she was a genie when I left Baghdad&quot;—does bring up the question of whether she, too, was born a genie. One minor subplot that lasted over multiple episodes was &quot;when&quot; Jeanie was born. In season 1, episode 5 (&quot;G.I.Jeannie&quot;), while applying for recruitment into the Air Force, Jeannie clearly states her birthday as July 1, 21 B.C. In Season 2, Episode 10 (&quot;The Girl Who Never Had a Birthday&quot;), Jeannie says she doesn&#x27;t know her birth date, setting up the two-episode plot. It was revealed by a computation by a computer (&quot;ERIC&quot;) in part 1 that Jeannie was born in 64 BC, and Roger learns the exact date, but it is not until the second episode after that two-part arc, &quot;My Master, the Great Caruso&quot;, that he is able to reveal that her birthday is April 1.

In the third season, this continuity was changed retroactively and the dialog imply Jeannie had always been a genie. All her relatives are also depicted as genies, including, by the fourth season, her mother (also played by Barbara Eden beginning in Season 4, Episode 2 &quot;Jeannie and the Wild Pipchicks&quot;). Whatever the reason for the shift in the narrative concerning her origins, this new narrative was retained for the rest of the series.

The television film &quot;I Dream of Jeannie... Fifteen Years Later&quot; (1985) has Jeannie re-stating most of her first-season origin when she tells her son, Tony Jr., that she was trapped in her bottle by an evil djinn after she refused to marry him. (No specific statement is given about whether he turned her into a genie at that time or if she had been born one.)

In a 1966 paperback novel &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, by Al Hine, writing pseudonymously as &quot;Dennis Brewster&quot;, published by Pocket Books, very loosely based on the series, Jeannie (in the book, her real name is revealed as &quot;Fawzia&quot;) and her immediate family were established in the story as genies living in Tehran hundreds of years before Tony found her bottle on an island in the Persian Gulf (instead of the South Pacific, as depicted on TV).

=== Theme music ===
The first-season theme music was an instrumental jazz waltz written by Richard Wess. Sidney Sheldon became dissatisfied with Wess&#x27;s theme and musical score. From the second season on, it was replaced by a new theme titled &quot;Jeannie&quot;, composed by Hugo Montenegro with lyrics by Buddy Kaye. Episodes 20 and 25 used a rerecorded ending of &quot;Jeannie&quot; for the closing credits with new, longer drum breaks and a different closing riff. The lyrics were never used in the show.

Songwriters Gerry Goffin and Carole King wrote a theme, called &quot;Jeannie&quot;, for Sidney Sheldon before the series started, but it was not used.

In the third and fourth seasons of the show, another instrumental theme by Hugo Montenegro was introduced that was played during the show&#x27;s campy scenes. Simply titled &quot;Mischief&quot;, the theme was heard mainly on outdoor locations, showing the characters attempting to do something such as Jeannie learning to drive, Major Nelson arriving up the driveway, a monkey walking around, or reactions to Doctor Bellows. This theme featured the accompaniment of a sideshow organ, a trombone, and electric bass. It was introduced in the first episode of season 3, &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot;.

A popular cover version of the &quot;Jeannie&quot; theme was released in 1985 in the compilation &quot;Television&#x27;s Greatest Hits: 65 TV Themes! From the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s&quot; by TVT Records. This recording was later sampled in several songs, such as DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince&#x27;s debut single &quot;Girls Ain&#x27;t Nothing but Trouble&quot; (from their 1987 debut album &quot;Rock the House&quot;), and also for the Ben Liebrand 1990 re-release of American hip-hop artist Dimples D.&#x27;s single, &quot;Sucker DJ&quot;.

DNA featuring Suzanne Vega released &quot;Tom&#x27;s Diner&quot; in 1990. A compilation album called &quot;Tom&#x27;s Album&quot; the following year included variations on the song; one of these was &quot;Jeannie&#x27;s Diner&quot; by Mark Jonathan Davis, which mashes up the Vega/DNA song with the Montenegro theme. This track was used by Nick at Nite for promos of its &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; reruns.

=== The bottle ===
Jeannie&#x27;s iconic bottle was not created for the show. The actual bottle was a special Christmas 1964 Jim Beam liquor decanter containing &quot;Beam&#x27;s Choice&quot; bourbon whiskey. It was designed by Roy Kramer for the Wheaton Bottle Company. For years, Sidney Sheldon was said to have received one as a gift and thought it would be a perfect design for the series. Several people in the Screen Gems art department also take credit for finding the bottle. Strong evidence, however, indicates first season director Gene Nelson saw one in a liquor store and bought it, bringing it to Sheldon.

Jeannie&#x27;s bottle was left in its original dark, smoke-green color, with a painted gold-leaf pattern (to make it look like an antique), during the first season. The plot description of the pilot episode in &quot;TV Guide&quot; in September 1965 referred to it as a &quot;green bottle&quot;. In that first episode, it also looked quite rough and weathered. Since the show was originally filmed in black and white, a lot of colors and patterns were not necessary. When the show switched to color, the show&#x27;s art director came up with a brightly colored purple bottle to replace the original. The later colorized version of the show&#x27;s first season tried to present that the smoked glass look of the original gold-leaf design was purple, to match the consistent look of the bottle used in the second through fifth seasons.

The first-season bottle had a clear glass stopper that Tony took from a 1956 Old Grand-Dad Bourbon bottle in his home, as the original stopper was left behind on the beach where Tony found Jeannie. In the first color episode, Jeannie returns to the beach, and her bottle is seen to have its original stopper (painted to match the bottle), presumably retrieved by her upon her return there. The rest of the TV series (and the films) used the original bottle stopper. (During some close-ups, one can still see the plastic rings that hold the cork part of the stopper in place.)

During the first season, in black and white, the smoke effect was usually a screen overlay of billowing smoke, sometimes combined with animation. Early color episodes used a purely animated smoke effect. Sometime later, a live smoke pack, lifted out of the bottle on a wire, was used.

Jeannie&#x27;s color-episodes bottle was painted mainly in pinks and purples, while the bottle for the Blue Djinn was a first-season design with a heavy green wash, and Jeannie&#x27;s sister&#x27;s bottle was simply a plain, unpainted Jim Beam bottle.

No one knows exactly how many bottles were used during the show, but members of the production have estimated that around 12 bottles were painted and used during the run of the series. The stunt bottle used mostly for the smoke effect was broken frequently by the heat and chemicals used to produce Jeannie&#x27;s smoke. In the pilot episode, several bottles were used for the opening scene on the beach; one was drilled through the bottom for smoke, and another was used to walk across the sand and slip into Tony&#x27;s pack. Two bottles were used from promotional tours to kick off the first season, and one bottle was used for the first-season production.

Barbara Eden got to keep the color stunt bottle used on the last day of filming the final episode of the series. It was given to her by her make-up woman after the show was canceled while the show was on hiatus. According to the DVD release of the first season, Bill Daily owned an original bottle, and according to the &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot; talk show, Larry Hagman also owned an original bottle.

In the penultimate episode, &quot;Hurricane Jeannie&quot;, Nelson dreams that Dr. Bellows discovers Jeannie&#x27;s secret, and that Jeannie&#x27;s bottle is broken when dropped. A broken bottle is shown on camera. This was intended to be the series&#x27; final episode and is often shown that way in syndication.

=== Multi-part story arcs ===
On several occasions, multipart story arcs were created to serve as backgrounds for national contests. During the second season, in a story that is the focus of a two-part episode and a peripheral plot of two further episodes (the &quot;Guess Jeannie&#x27;s Birthday&quot; contest began with the opening two-part episode on November 14, 1966, concluding with the name of the winner revealed after the end of the fourth episode, &quot;My Master, the Great Caruso&quot;, on December 5), it was established that Jeannie did not know her birthday, and her family members could not agree when it was, either. Tony and Roger use NASA&#x27;s powerful new computer and horoscopic guidance based on Jeannie&#x27;s traits to calculate it. The year is quickly established as 64 BC, but only Roger is privy to the exact date and he decides to make a game out of revealing it. This date became the basis of the contest. Jeannie finally forces it out of him at the end of the fourth episode: April 1.

In a third-season four-part episode (&quot;Genie, Genie, Who&#x27;s Got the Genie?&quot; January 16 – February 6, 1968), Jeannie is locked in a safe bound for the Moon. Any attempt to force the safe or use the wrong combination will destroy it with an explosive. Jeannie is in there so long that whoever opens the safe will become her master. The episodes spread out over four weeks, during which a contest was held to guess the safe&#x27;s combination. This explains why Larry Hagman is never seen saying the combination out loud: His mouth is hidden behind the safe or the shot is on Jeannie when he says it. The combination was not decided until just before the episode aired, with Hagman&#x27;s voice dubbed in. Over the closing credits, Barbara Eden announced and congratulated the contest winner, with 4–9–7 as the winning combination.

In the fourth season, a two-part episode, &quot;The Case Of My Vanishing Master&quot; (January 6–13, 1969), concerned Tony being taken to a secret location somewhere in the world, while a perfect double took his place at home. A contest was held to guess the location where Tony had been taken. Unlike earlier contests, the answer was not revealed within the story. At the end of &quot;Invisible House For Sale&quot; (February 3, 1969), a special &quot;contest epilogue&quot; had Jeannie and Tony reveal to the audience the &quot;secret location&quot;, Puerto Rico, followed by the name of the &quot;Grand Prize Winner&quot;.

== Release ==

=== Syndication ===
When reruns debuted on New York&#x27;s WPIX, &quot;Jeannie&quot; won its time period with a 13 rating and a 23 share of the audience. The series averaged a 14 share and 32 share of the audience when WTTG in Washington, DC began airing the series. It was the first off-network series to best network competition in the ratings: &quot;The big switch no doubt representing the first time in rating history that indies (local stations) have knocked over the network stations in a primetime slot was promoted by WPIX&#x27;s premiere of the off-web &quot;Jeannie&quot; reruns back to back from 7 to 8 pm.&quot;

In India, Sony Entertainment Television showed the series dubbed in Hindi in the late 1990s.
It started airing again on Zee Cafe in India in 2020.

In Italy, the series aired on Rai 1 under the name &quot;Strega per amore&quot; (&quot;Witch for Love&quot;) from 1977 until 1980, then repeated on Paramount Channel from 2020 until 2021.

In France, TF1 aired the series dubbed in French from 1993 to 1998.

=== Home media ===

==== DVD/Blu-ray ====
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has released all 5 seasons of &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; on DVD in regions 1, 2 &amp; 4 in individual season releases and complete series box sets (there were two different packaging versions for the complete series of 20 discs). The first season was made available in both the original black &amp; white and colorized editions — only the colorized version was included in the complete series releases from Sony.

On August 27, 2013, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the R1 rights to various television series from the Sony Pictures library including &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;. They rereleased the first two seasons on DVD on April 1, 2014; Mill Creek released season one in its original black-and-white format only as they currently do not have the rights to Sony’s colorized version. On October 6, 2015, Mill Creek Entertainment rereleased &quot;I Dream of Jeannie: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in region 1, though it did not port over both of the special features found on the first season of the Sony releases.
Mill Creek Entertainment released the entire series on Blu-ray, after several delays, on November 30, 2021. However, most consumers and reviewers complained that rather than true remastered HD, Mill Creek simply used an SD master upscaled to 1080i. The company has yet to admit this publicly to fans regardless of many inquires. Fortunately, the series streams in actual HD online, proving that such prints exist in the Sony vaults.

In Australia, a repackaged complete series collection was released on November 23, 2010. On November 4, 2015, a 50th anniversary edition of the complete series was released. On July 6, 2016, all five individual seasons were rereleased as well as another complete series collection, now distributed through Shock Entertainment.

<doc id="415000" wikidata="Q298933" url="?curid=415000" title="Edward Drinker Cope">
<text>Edward Drinker Cope (July 28, 1840 – April 12, 1897) was an American zoologist, paleontologist, comparative anatomist, herpetologist, and ichthyologist. Born to a wealthy Quaker family, he distinguished himself as a child prodigy interested in science, publishing his first scientific paper at the age of 19. Though his father tried to raise Cope as a gentleman farmer, he eventually acquiesced to his son&#x27;s scientific aspirations.

Cope had little formal scientific training, and he eschewed a teaching position for field work. He made regular trips to the American West, prospecting in the 1870s and 1880s, often as a member of U.S. Geological Survey teams. A personal feud between Cope and paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh led to a period of intense fossil-finding competition now known as the Bone Wars. Cope&#x27;s financial fortunes soured after failed mining ventures in the 1880s, forcing him to sell off much of his fossil collection. He experienced a resurgence in his career toward the end of his life before dying on April 12, 1897.

Though Cope&#x27;s scientific pursuits nearly bankrupted him, his contributions helped to define the field of American paleontology. He was a prodigious writer with 1,400 papers published over his lifetime, although his rivals debated the accuracy of his rapidly published works. He discovered, described, and named more than 1,000 vertebrate species, including hundreds of fishes and dozens of dinosaurs. His proposal for the origin of mammalian molars is notable among his theoretical contributions.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Edward Drinker Cope was born on July 28, 1840, the eldest son of Alfred Cope and Hannah, daughter of Thomas Edge, of Chester County, Pennsylvania. He was a distant cousin of historian Gilbert Cope. His middle name, &quot;Drinker&quot;, was his paternal grandmother&#x27;s maiden name, she being daughter of John Drinker, of Philadelphia. The Cope family were of English origin; the first to settle in America, in 1683, was Oliver Cope, a tailor formerly of Avebury, Wiltshire, who was granted two hundred and fifty acres in Delaware. The death of his mother when he was three years old seemed to have had little effect on young Edward, as he mentioned in his letters that he had no recollection of her. His stepmother, Rebecca Biddle, filled the maternal role; Cope referred to her warmly, as well as his younger stepbrother, James Biddle Cope. Alfred, an orthodox member of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), operated a lucrative shipping business started by his father, Thomas P. Cope, in 1821. He was a philanthropist who gave money to the Society of Friends, the Philadelphia Zoological Gardens, and the Institute for Colored Youth.

Edward was born and raised in a large stone house called &quot;Fairfield&quot;, whose location is now within the boundaries of Philadelphia. The of pristine and exotic gardens of the house offered a landscape that Edward was able to explore. The Copes began teaching their children to read and write while very young, and took Edward on trips across New England and to museums, zoos, and gardens. Cope&#x27;s interest in animals became apparent at a young age, as did his natural artistic ability.

Alfred intended to give his son the same education he himself had received. At age nine, Edward was sent to a day school in Philadelphia; at 12, he attended the Friends&#x27; Boarding School at Westtown, near West Chester, Pennsylvania. The school was founded in 1799 with fundraising by members of the Society of Friends (Quakers), and provided much of the Cope family&#x27;s education. The prestigious school was expensive, costing Alfred $500 in tuition each year, and in his first year, Edward studied algebra, chemistry, scripture, physiology, grammar, astronomy, and Latin. Edward&#x27;s letters home requesting a larger allowance show he was able to manipulate his father, and he was, according to author and Cope biographer Jane Davidson, &quot;a bit of a spoiled brat&quot;. His letters suggest he was lonely at the school—it was the first time he had been away from his home for an extended period. Otherwise, Edward&#x27;s studies progressed much like a typical boy—he consistently had &quot;less than perfect&quot; or &quot;not quite satisfactory&quot; marks for conduct from his teachers, and did not work hard on his penmanship lessons, which may have contributed to his often-illegible handwriting as an adult.

Edward returned to Westtown in 1855, accompanied by two of his sisters. Biology began to interest him more that year, and he studied natural history texts in his spare time. While at the school, he frequently visited the Academy of Natural Sciences. Edward often obtained bad marks due to quarreling and bad conduct. His letters to his father show he chafed at farm work and betrayed flashes of the temper for which he would later become well known. After sending Edward back to the farm for summer break in 1854 and 1855, Alfred did not return Edward to school after spring 1856. Instead, Alfred attempted to turn his son into a gentleman farmer, which he considered a wholesome profession that would yield enough profit to lead a comfortable life, and improve the undersized Edward&#x27;s health. Until 1863, Cope&#x27;s letters to his father continually expressed his yearning for a more professional scientific career than that of a farmer, which he called &quot;dreadfully boring&quot;.

While working on farms, Edward continued his education on his own. In 1858, he began working part-time at the Academy of Natural Sciences, reclassifying and cataloguing specimens, and published his first series of research results in January 1859. Cope began taking French and German classes with a former Westtown teacher. Though Alfred resisted his son&#x27;s pursuit of a science career, he paid for his son&#x27;s private studies. Instead of working the farm his father bought for him, Edward rented out the land and used the income to further his scientific endeavors.

Alfred finally gave in to Edward&#x27;s wishes and paid for university classes. Cope attended the University of Pennsylvania in the 1861 and/or 1862 academic years, studying comparative anatomy under Joseph Leidy, one of the most influential anatomists and paleontologists at the time. Cope asked his father to pay for a tutor in German and French to allow him to read scholarly works in those languages. During this period, he had a job recataloging the herpetological collection at the Academy of Natural Sciences, where he became a member at Leidy&#x27;s urging. Cope visited the Smithsonian Institution on occasion, where he became acquainted with Spencer Baird, who was an expert in the fields of ornithology and ichthyology. In 1861, he published his first paper on Salamandridae classification; over the next five years he published primarily on reptiles and amphibians. Cope&#x27;s membership in the Academy of Natural Sciences and American Philosophical Society gave him outlets to publish and announce his work; many of his early paleontological works were published by the Philosophical Society.

=== European travels ===
In 1863 and 1864, during the American Civil War, Cope traveled through Europe, taking the opportunity to visit the most esteemed museums and societies of the time. Initially, he seemed interested in helping out at a field hospital, but in letters to his father later on in the war, this aspiration seemed to disappear; instead he considered working in the American South to assist freed African Americans. Davidson suggests Cope&#x27;s correspondence with Leidy and Ferdinand Hayden, who worked as field surgeons during the war, might have informed Cope of the horrors of the occupation. Edward was involved in a love affair; his father did not approve. Whether Edward or the unnamed woman (whom he at one point intended to marry) broke off the relationship is unknown, but he took the breakup poorly. Biographer and paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn attributed Edward&#x27;s sudden departure for Europe as a method of keeping him from being drafted into the Civil War. Cope did write to his father from London on February 11, 1864, &quot;I shall get home in time to catch and be caught by the new draft. I shall not be sorry for this, as I know certain persons who would be mean enough to say that I have gone to Europe to avoid the war.&quot; Eventually, Cope took the pragmatic approach and waited out the conflict. He may have suffered from mild depression during this period, and often complained of boredom.

Despite his torpor, Edward proceeded with his tour of Europe, and met with some of the most highly esteemed scientists of the world during his travels through France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Austria, Italy, and Eastern Europe, most likely with introductory letters from Leidy and Spencer Baird. In the winter of 1863, Edward met Othniel Charles Marsh while in Berlin. Marsh, age 32, was attending the University of Berlin. He held two university degrees in comparison to Edward&#x27;s lack of formal schooling past 16, but Edward had written 37 scientific papers in comparison to Marsh&#x27;s two published works. While they would later become rivals, the two men appeared to take a liking to each other upon meeting. Marsh led Edward on a tour of the city, and they stayed together for days. After Edward left Berlin, the two maintained correspondence, exchanging manuscripts, fossils, and photographs. Edward burned many of his journals and letters from Europe upon his return to the United States. Friends intervened and stopped Cope from destroying some of his drawings and notes, in what author Url Lanham deemed a &quot;partial suicide&quot;.

=== Family and early career ===
When Cope returned to Philadelphia in 1864, his family made every effort to secure him a teaching post as the Professor of Zoology at Haverford College, a small Quaker school where the family had philanthropic ties. The college awarded him an honorary master&#x27;s degree so he could have the position. Cope even began to think about marriage and consulted his father in the matter, telling him of the girl he would like to marry: &quot;an amiable woman, not over sensitive, with considerable energy, and especially one inclined to be serious and not inclined to frivolity and display—the more truly Christian of course the better—seems to be the most practically the most suitable for me, though intellect and accomplishments have more charm.&quot; Cope thought of Annie Pim, a member of the Society of Friends, as less a lover than companion, declaring, &quot;her amiability and domestic qualities generally, her capability of taking care of a house, etc., as well as her steady seriousness weigh far more with me than any of the traits which form the theme of poets!&quot; Cope&#x27;s family approved of his choice, and the marriage took place in July 1865 at Pim&#x27;s farmhouse in Chester County, Pennsylvania. The two had a single daughter, Julia Biddle Cope, born June 10, 1866. Cope&#x27;s return to the United States also marked an expansion of his scientific studies; in 1864, he described several fishes, a whale, and the amphibian &quot;Amphibamus grandiceps&quot; (his first paleontological contribution).

During the period between 1866 and 1867, Cope went on trips to western parts of the country. He related to his father his scientific experiences; to his daughter he sent descriptions of animal life as part of her education. Cope found educating his students at Haverford &quot;a pleasure&quot;, but wrote to his father that he &quot;could not get any work done.&quot; He resigned from his position at Haverford and moved his family to Haddonfield, in part to be closer to the fossil beds of western New Jersey. Due to the time-consuming nature of his Haverford position, Cope had not had time to attend to his farm and had let it out to others, but eventually found he was in need of more money to fuel his scientific habits. Pleading with his father for money to pursue his career, he finally sold the farm in 1869. Alfred apparently did not press his son to continue farming, and Edward focused on his scientific career. He continued his continental travels, including trips to Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina. He visited caves across the region. He stopped these cave explorations after an 1871 trip to the Wyandotte Caves in Indiana, but remained interested in the subject. Cope had visited Haddonfield many times in the 1860s, paying periodic visits to the marl pits. The fossils he found in these pits became the focus of several papers, including a description in 1868 of &quot;Elasmosaurus platyurus&quot; and &quot;Laelaps&quot;. Marsh accompanied him on one of these excursions. Cope&#x27;s proximity to the beds after moving to Haddonfield made more frequent trips possible. The Copes lived comfortably in a frame house backed by an apple orchard. Two maids tended the estate, which entertained a number of guests. Cope&#x27;s only concern was for more money to spend on his scientific work.

The 1870s were the golden years of Cope&#x27;s career, marked by his most prominent discoveries and rapid flow of publications. Among his descriptions were the therapsid &quot;Lystrosaurus&quot; (1870), the archosauromorph &quot;Champsosaurus&quot; (1876), and the sauropod &quot;Amphicoelias&quot; (1878), possibly the largest dinosaur ever discovered. In the period of one year, from 1879 to 1880, Cope published 76 papers based on his travels through New Mexico and Colorado, and on the findings of his collectors in Texas, Kansas, Oregon, Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah. During the peak years, Cope published around 25 reports and preliminary observations each year. The hurried publications led to errors in interpretation and naming—many of his scientific names were later canceled or withdrawn. In comparison, Marsh wrote and published less frequently and more succinctly—his works appeared in the widely read &quot;American Journal of Science,&quot; which led to faster reception abroad, and Marsh&#x27;s reputation grew more rapidly than Cope&#x27;s.
In autumn 1871, Cope began prospecting farther west to the fossil fields of Kansas. Leidy and Marsh had been to the region earlier, and Cope employed one of Marsh&#x27;s guides, Benjamin Mudge, who was in want of a job. Cope&#x27;s companion Charles Sternberg described the lack of water and good food available to Cope and his helpers on these expeditions. Cope would suffer from a &quot;severe attack of nightmare&quot; in which &quot;every animal of which we had found trace during the day played with him at night ... sometimes he would lose half the night in this exhausting slumber.&quot; Nevertheless, Cope continued to lead the party from sunrise to sunset, sending letters to his wife and child describing his finds. The severe desert conditions and Cope&#x27;s habit of overworking himself till he was bedridden caught up with him, and in 1872, he broke down from exhaustion. Cope maintained a regular pattern of summers spent prospecting and winters writing up his findings from 1871 to 1879.

Throughout the decade, Cope traveled across the West, exploring rocks of the Eocene in 1872 and the Titanothere Beds of Colorado in 1873. In 1874, Cope was employed with the Wheeler Survey, a group of surveys led by George Montague Wheeler that mapped parts of the United States west of the 100th meridian. The survey traveled through New Mexico, whose Puerco formations, he wrote to his father, provided &quot;the most important find in geology I have ever made&quot;. The New Mexico bluffs contained millions of years of formation and subsequent deformation, and were in an area which had not been visited by Leidy or Marsh. Being part of the survey had other advantages; Cope was able to draw on fort commissaries and defray publishing costs. While there was no salary, his findings would be published in the annual reports the surveys printed. Cope brought Annie and Julia along on one such survey, and rented a house for them at Fort Bridger, but he spent more of his own money on these survey trips than he would have liked.

Alfred died December 4, 1875, and left Edward with an inheritance of nearly a quarter of a million dollars. Alfred&#x27;s death was a blow to Cope; his father was a constant confidant. The same year marked a suspension of much of Cope&#x27;s field work and a new emphasis on writing up discoveries of the previous years. His chief publication of the time, &quot;The Vertebrata of the Cretaceous Formations of the West&quot;, was a collection of 303 pages and 54 illustration plates. The memoir summarized his experiences prospecting in New Jersey and Kansas. Cope now had the finances to hire multiple teams to search for fossils for him year-round and he advised the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition on their fossil displays. Cope&#x27;s studies of marine reptiles of Kansas closed in 1876, opening a new focus on terrestrial reptiles. The same year, Cope moved from Haddonfield to 2100 and 2102 Pine Street in Philadelphia. He converted one of the two houses into a museum where he stored his growing collection of fossils. Cope&#x27;s expeditions took him across Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Montana. His initial journey into the Clarendon beds of Upper Miocene and Lower Pliocene of Texas led to an affiliation with the Geological Survey of Texas. Cope&#x27;s papers on the region constitute some of his most important paleontological contributions. In 1877, he purchased half the rights to the &quot;American Naturalist&quot; to publish the papers he produced at a rate so high, Marsh questioned their dating.

Cope returned to Europe in August 1878 in response to an invitation to join the British Association for the Advancement of Science&#x27;s Dublin meeting. He was warmly welcomed in England and France, and met with the distinguished paleontologists and archeologists of the period. Marsh&#x27;s attempts to sully Cope&#x27;s reputation had made little impact on anyone save paleontologist Thomas Henry Huxley, who according to Osborn, &quot;alone treated [Cope] with coolness&quot;. Following the Dublin meeting, Cope spent two days with the French Association for the Advancement of Science. At each gathering, Cope exhibited dinosaur restorations by Philadelphia colleague John A. Ryder and various charts and plates from geological surveys of the 1870s led by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden. He returned to London on October 12, meeting with anatomist Richard Owen, ichthyologist Albert Günther, and paleontologist H. G. Seeley. While in Europe, Cope purchased a great collection of fossils from Argentina. Cope never found time to describe the collection and many of the boxes remained unopened until his death.

=== Bone Wars ===

Cope&#x27;s relations with Marsh turned into a competition for fossils between the two, known today as the Bone Wars. The conflict&#x27;s seeds began upon the men&#x27;s return to the United States in the 1860s, although Cope named &quot;Colosteus marshii&quot; for Marsh in 1867, and Marsh returned the favor, naming &quot;Mosasaurus copeanus&quot; for Cope in 1869. Cope introduced his colleague to the marl pit owner Albert Vorhees when the two visited the site. Marsh went behind Cope&#x27;s back and made a private agreement with Vorhees: any fossils that Vorhees&#x27;s men found were sent back to Marsh at New Haven. When Marsh was at Haddonfield examining one of Cope&#x27;s fossil finds—a complete skeleton of a large aquatic plesiosaur, &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;, that had four flippers and a long neck—he commented that the fossil&#x27;s head was on the wrong end, evidently stating that Cope had put the skull at the end of the vertebrae of the tail. Cope was outraged and the two argued for some time until they agreed to have Leidy examine the bones and determine who was right. Leidy came, picked up the head of the fossil and put it on the other end. Cope was horrified since he had already published a paper on the fossil with the error at the American Philosophical Society. He immediately tried to buy back the copies, but some remained with their buyers (Marsh and Leidy kept theirs). The whole ordeal might have passed easily enough had Leidy not exposed the cover-up at the next society meeting, not to alienate Cope, but only in response to Cope&#x27;s brief statement where he never admitted he was wrong. Cope and Marsh would never talk to each other amicably again, and by 1873, open hostility had broken out between them.

The rivalry between the two increased towards the latter half of the 1870s. In 1877, Marsh received a letter from Arthur Lakes, a schoolteacher in Golden, Colorado. Lakes had been hiking in the mountains near the town of Morrison with his friend, H. C. Beckwith, looking for fossilized leaves in the Dakota sandstone. Instead, the pair found large bones embedded in the rock. Lakes wrote that the bones were &quot;apparently a vertebra and a humerus bone of some gigantic saurian.&quot; While Lakes sent Marsh some 1,500 pounds of bone, he also sent Cope some of the specimens. Marsh published his finds first, and having been paid $100 for the finds Lakes wrote to Cope that the samples should be forwarded to Marsh. Cope was offended by the slight. Meanwhile, Cope received bones from school superintendent O.W. Lucas in March 1877 from Cañon City; the remains were of a dinosaur even bigger than Lakes&#x27; that Marsh had described.

Word that Lakes had notified Cope of his finds galvanized Marsh into action. When Marsh heard from Union Pacific Railroad workers W.E. Carlin and W.H. Reed about a vast boneyard northwest of Laramie in Como Bluff, Marsh sent his agent, Samuel Wendell Williston, to take charge of the digging. Cope, in response, learned of Carlin and Reed&#x27;s discoveries and sent his own men to find bones in the area. The two scientists attempted to sabotage each other&#x27;s progress. Cope was described as a genius and what Marsh lacked in intelligence, he easily made up for in connections—Marsh&#x27;s uncle was George Peabody, a rich banker who supported Marsh with money, and a secure position at the Peabody Museum. Marsh lobbied John Wesley Powell to act against Cope and attempted to persuade Hayden to &quot;muzzle&quot; Cope&#x27;s publishing. Both men tried to spy on the other&#x27;s whereabouts and attempted to offer their collectors more money in the hopes of recruiting them to their own side. Cope was able to recruit David Baldwin in New Mexico and Frank Williston in Wyoming from Marsh. Cope and Marsh were extremely secretive as to the source of their fossils. When Henry Fairfield Osborn, at the time a student at Princeton, visited Cope to ask where to travel to look for fossils in the West, Cope politely refused to answer.

When Cope arrived back in the United States after his tour of Europe in 1878, he had nearly two years of fossil findings from Lucas. Among these dinosaurs was &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, one of the most recognizable dinosaur recreations of the time. The summer of 1879 took Cope to Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and north to Oregon, where he was amazed at the rich flora and the blueness of the Pacific Ocean. In 1879, the United States Congress consolidated the various government survey teams into the United States Geological Survey with Clarence King as its leader. This was discouraging to Cope because King named Marsh, an old college friend, as the chief paleontologist. The period of Cope&#x27;s and Marsh&#x27;s paleontological digs in the American West spanned from 1877 to 1892, by which time both men exhausted much of their financial resources.

=== Later years ===

The 1880s proved disastrous for Cope. Marsh&#x27;s close association with the Geological Survey gave him the resources to employ 54 staff members over the course of ten years. His teaching position at Yale meant he had guaranteed access to the &quot;American Journal of Science&quot; for publication. Cope had his interest in the &quot;Naturalist&quot;, but it drained him of funds. After Hayden was removed from the survey, Cope lost his source of government funding. His fortune was not enough to support his rivalry, so Cope invested in mining. Most of his properties were silver mines in New Mexico; one mine yielded an ore vein worth $3 million in silver chloride. Cope visited the mines each summer from 1881 to 1885, taking the opportunity to supervise or collect other minerals. For a while he made good money, but the mines stopped producing and by 1886 he had to give up his now-worthless stocks. The same year he received a teaching position at the University of Pennsylvania. He continued to travel west, but realized he would not be able to best Marsh in cornering the market for bones; he had to release the collectors he had hired and sell his collections. During this period, he published 40 to 75 papers each year. With the failure of his mines, Cope began searching for a job, but was turned down at the Smithsonian and American Museum of Natural History. He turned to giving lectures for hire and writing magazine articles. Each year, he lobbied Congress for an appropriation with which to finish his work on &quot;Cope&#x27;s Bible&quot;, a volume on Tertiary vertebrates, but was continually turned down. Rather than work with Powell and the survey, Cope tried to inflame sentiment against them.

At Marsh&#x27;s urging, Powell pushed for Cope to return specimens he had unearthed during his employment under the government surveys. This was an outrage to Cope, who had used his own money while working as a volunteer. In response, Cope went to the editor of the &quot;New York Herald&quot; and promised a scandalous headline. Since 1885, Cope had kept an elaborate journal of mistakes and misdeeds that both Marsh and Powell had committed over the years. From scientific errors to publishing mistakes, he had them written down in a journal he kept in the bottom drawer of his Pine Street desk. Cope sought out Marsh&#x27;s assistants, who complained of being denied access and credit by their employer and of being chronically underpaid. Reporter William Hosea Ballou ran the first article on January 12, 1890, in what would become a series of newspaper debates between Marsh, Powell, and Cope. Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds. Marsh and Powell published their own side of the story and, in the end, little changed. No congressional hearing was created to investigate Powell&#x27;s alleged misallocation of funds, while Cope and Marsh were not held responsible for any mistakes. Indirectly, however, the attacks may have been influential in Marsh&#x27;s fall from power in the survey. Due to pressure from Powell over bad press, Marsh was removed from his position for the government surveys. Cope&#x27;s relations with the president of the University of Pennsylvania soured, and the entire funding for paleontology in the government surveys was pulled.

Cope took his sinking fortunes in stride. In writing to Osborn about the articles, he laughed at the outcome, saying, &quot;It will now rest largely with you whether or not I am supposed to be a liar and am actuated by jealousy and disappointment. I think Marsh is impaled on the horns of &quot;Monoclonius sphenocerus&quot;.&quot; Cope was well aware of his enemies and was carefree enough to name a species after a combination of &quot;Cope&quot; and &quot;hater&quot;, &quot;Anisonchus cophater&quot;. Through his years of financial hardship, he was able to continue publishing papers—his most productive years were 1884 and 1885, with 79 and 62 papers published, respectively. The 1880s marked the publication of two of the best-known fossil taxa described by Cope: the pelycosaur &quot;Edaphosaurus&quot; in 1882 and the early dinosaur &quot;Coelophysis&quot; in 1889. In 1889, he succeeded Leidy, who had died the previous year, as professor of zoology at the University of Pennsylvania. The small yearly stipend was enough for Cope&#x27;s family to move back into one of the townhouses he had been forced to relinquish earlier.

In 1892, Cope (then 52 years old) was granted expense money for field work from the Texas Geological Survey. With his finances improved, he was able to publish a massive work on the &quot;Batrachians of North America&quot;, which was the most detailed analysis and organization of the continent&#x27;s frogs and amphibians ever mastered, and the 1,115-page &quot;The Crocodilians Lizards and Snakes of North America&quot;. In the 1890s, his publication rate increased to an average of 43 articles a year. His final expedition to the West took place in 1894, when he prospected for dinosaurs in South Dakota and visited sites in Texas and Oklahoma. The same year, Julia was married to William H. Collins, a Haverford astronomy professor. The couple&#x27;s ages—Julia was 28 and the groom 35—were past the conventions of Victorian marriage. After their European honeymoon, the couple returned to Haverford. While Annie moved to Haverford, as well, Cope did not. His official reason was the long commute and late lectures he gave in Philadelphia. In private correspondence, however, Osborn wrote that the two had essentially separated, though they remained on amiable terms.

Cope sold his collections to the American Museum of Natural History in 1895; his set of 10,000 American fossil mammals sold for $32,000, lower than Cope&#x27;s asking price of $50,000. The purchase was financed by the donations from New York&#x27;s high society. Cope sold three other collections for $29,000. While his collection contained more than 13,000 specimens, Cope&#x27;s fossil hoard was still much smaller than Marsh&#x27;s collection, valued at over a million dollars. The University of Pennsylvania bought part of Cope&#x27;s ethnological artifact collection for $5,500. The Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia&#x27;s foremost museum, did not bid on any of Cope&#x27;s sales due to bad blood between Cope and the museum&#x27;s leaders; as a result, many of Cope&#x27;s major finds left the city. Cope&#x27;s proceeds from the sales allowed him to rehire Sternberg to prospect for fossils on his behalf.

=== Death ===

In 1896, Cope began suffering from a gastrointestinal illness he said was cystitis. His wife cared for him in Philadelphia when she was able; at other times, Cope&#x27;s university secretary, Anna Brown, tended to him. Cope at this time lived in his Pine Street museum and rested on a cot surrounded by his fossil finds. Cope often prescribed himself medications, including large amounts of morphine, belladonna, and formalin, a substance based on formaldehyde used to preserve specimens. Osborn was horrified by Cope&#x27;s actions and made arrangements for surgery, but the plans were put on hold after a temporary improvement in Cope&#x27;s health. Cope went to Virginia looking for fossils, became ill again, and returned to his home very weak. Osborn visited Cope on April 5, inquiring about Cope&#x27;s health, but the sick paleontologist pressed his friend for his views on the origin of mammals. Word of Cope&#x27;s illness spread, and he was visited by friends and colleagues; even in a feverish condition Cope delivered lectures from his bed. Cope died on April 12, 1897, 16 weeks short of his 57th birthday.

Sternberg, still prospecting for Cope that spring, was woken by a liveryman who relayed word from Annie that Cope had died three days earlier. Sternberg wrote in his memoirs, &quot;I had lost friends before, and I had known what it was to bury my own dead, even my firstborn son, but I had never sorrowed more deeply than I did over the news.&quot; Cope&#x27;s Quaker funeral consisted of six men: Osborn, his colleague William Berryman Scott, Cope&#x27;s friend Persifor Frazer, son-in-law Collins, Horatio Wood, and Harrison Allen. The six sat around Cope&#x27;s coffin among the fossils and Cope&#x27;s pets, a tortoise and a Gila monster, for what Osborn called &quot;a perfect Quaker silence ... an interminable length of time.&quot; Anticipating the quiet, Osborn had brought along a Bible and read an excerpt from the Book of Job, ending by saying, &quot;These are the problems to which our friend devoted his life.&quot;

The coffin was loaded on a hearse and carried to a gathering at Fairfield; much of the gathering was spent in silence. After the coffin was removed, the assembled began talking. Frazer recalled that each person remembered Cope differently, and &quot;Few men succeeded so well in concealing from anyone ... all the sides of his multiform character.&quot; Osborn, intending to follow the coffin to the graveyard, was instead pulled aside by Collins and taken to the reading of Cope&#x27;s will—Osborn and Cope&#x27;s brother-in-law John Garrett were named executors. Cope gave his family a choice of his books, with the remainder to be sold or donated to the University of Pennsylvania. After debts were handled, Cope left small bequests to friends and family—Anna Brown and Julia received $5000 each, while the remainder went to Annie. Cope&#x27;s estate was valued at $75,327, not including additional revenue raised by sales of fossils to the American Museum of Natural History, for a total of $84,600. Some specimens preserved in alcohol made their way to the Academy of Natural Sciences, including a few Gordian worms.

Cope insisted through his will that no graveside service or burial be held; he had donated his body to science. He issued a final challenge to Marsh at his death: he had his skull donated to science so his brain could be measured, hoping his brain would be larger than that of his adversary; at the time, brain size was thought to be the true measure of intelligence. Marsh never accepted the challenge.

Osborn listed Cope&#x27;s cause of death as uremic poisoning, combined with a large prostate, but the true cause of death is unknown. Many believed Cope had died of syphilis contracted from the women with whom he fraternized during his travels. In 1995, Davidson gained permission to have the skeleton examined by a medical doctor at the university. Dr. Morrie Kricun, a professor of radiology, concluded no evidence of bony syphilis was found on Cope&#x27;s skeleton.

Public mentions of Cope&#x27;s death were relatively slight. The &quot;Naturalist&quot; ran four photographs, a six-page obituary by editor J. S. Kingsley, and a two-page remembrance by Frazer. The National Academy of Sciences&#x27; official memoir was submitted years later and written by Osborn. The &quot;American Journal of Science&quot; devoted six paragraphs to Cope&#x27;s passing, and incorrectly gave his age as 46. Cope was outlived by his rival Marsh, who was suffering poor health.

== Personality==
Julia assisted Osborn in writing a biography of her father, titled &quot;Cope: Master Naturalist&quot;. She would not comment on the name of the woman with whom her father had had an affair prior to his first European travel. Julia is believed to have burned any of the scandalous letters and journals Cope had kept, but many of his friends were able to give their recollections of the scandalous nature of some of Cope&#x27;s unpublished routines. Charles R. Knight, a former friend called, &quot;Cope&#x27;s mouth the filthiest, from hearsay that in [Cope&#x27;s] heyday no woman was safe within five miles of him.&quot; As Julia was the major financier behind &quot;The Master Naturalist&quot;, she wanted to keep her father&#x27;s name in good standing and refused to comment on any misdeeds her father might have committed.

Cope was described by zoologist Henry Weed Fowler as &quot;a man of medium height and build, but always impressive with his great energy and activity&quot;. To him, Fowler wrote, &quot;[Cope] was both genial and always interesting, easily approachable, and both kindly and helpful.&quot; Cope&#x27;s affability during visits to the Academy of Natural Sciences to compare specimens was later recalled by his colleague Witmer Stone: &quot;I have often seen him busily engaged in such comparisons, all the while whistling whole passages from grand opera, or else counting the scales on the back of a lizard, while he conversed in a most amusing manner with some small street urchin who had drifted into the museum and was watching in awe with eyes and mouth wide open.&quot; His self-taught nature, however, meant that he was largely hostile to bureaucracy and politics. He had a famous temper; one friend called Cope a &quot;militant paleontologist&quot;. Despite his faults, he was generally well liked by his contemporaries. American paleontologist Alfred Romer wrote that, &quot;[Cope&#x27;s] little slips from virtue were those we might make ourselves, were we bolder&quot;.

Cope was raised as a Quaker, and was taught that the Bible was literal truth. Although he never confronted his family about their religious views, Osborn writes that Cope was at least aware of the conflict between his scientific career and his religion. Osborn writes: &quot;If Edward harbored intellectual doubts about the literalness of the Bible ... he did not express them in his letters to his family but there can be little question ... that he shared the intellectual unrest of the period.&quot; Lanham writes that Cope&#x27;s religious fervor (which seems to have subsided after his father&#x27;s death) was embarrassing to even his devout Quaker associates. Biographer Jane Davidson believes that Osborn overstated Cope&#x27;s internal religious conflicts. She ascribes Cope&#x27;s deference to his father&#x27;s beliefs as an act of respect or a measure to retain his father&#x27;s financial support. Frazer&#x27;s reminiscences about his friend suggest Cope often told people what they wanted to hear, rather than his true views.

==Views==
As a young man, Cope read Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Voyage of a Naturalist&quot;, which had little effect on him. The only comment about Darwin&#x27;s book recorded by Cope was that Darwin discussed &quot;too much geology&quot; from the account of his voyage. Due to his background in taxonomy and paleontology, Cope focused on evolution in terms of changing structure, rather than emphasizing geography and variation within populations as Darwin had. Over his lifetime, Cope&#x27;s views on evolution shifted. His early views held that while Darwin&#x27;s natural selection may affect the preservation of superficial characteristics in organisms, natural selection alone could not explain the formation of genera. Cope&#x27;s suggested mechanism for this action was a &quot;steady progressive development of organization&quot; through what Cope termed &quot;a continual crowding backward of the successive steps of individual development&quot;. His beliefs later evolved to one with an increased emphasis on continual and utilitarian evolution with less involvement of a Creator. He became one of the founders of the Neo-Lamarckism school of thought, which holds that an individual can pass on traits acquired in its lifetime to offspring. Although the view has been shown incorrect, it was the prevalent theory among paleontologists in Cope&#x27;s time. In 1887, Cope published his own &quot;Origin of the Fittest: Essays in Evolution&quot;, detailing his views on the subject. He was a strong believer in the law of use and disuse—that an individual will slowly, over time, favor an anatomical part of its body so much that it will become stronger and larger as time progresses down the generations. The giraffe, for example, stretched its neck to reach taller trees and passed this acquired characteristic to its offspring in a developmental phase that is added to gestation in the womb.

Cope&#x27;s &quot;Theology of Evolution&quot; (1887) argued that consciousness comes from the mind of the universe and governs evolution by directing animals to new goals. According to Sideris (2003), &quot;[Cope] argued that organisms respond to changes in their environments by an exercise of choice. Consciousness itself, he maintained, was the principal force in evolution. Cope credited God with having built into evolution a life force that propelled organisms toward even higher levels of consciousness.&quot;

Cope&#x27;s views on human races and sex were influenced by his Lamarckian beliefs, which posited those of European ancestry as more highly evolved than nonwhite groups. In his essays on evolution, he assessed the physiognomies of three &quot;sub-species of human&quot; — termed the Negro, the Mongolian, and the Indo-European — in comparison to those of apes and human embryos, and drew the following conclusion:The Indo-European race is then the highest by virtue of the acceleration of growth in the development of the muscles by which the body is maintained in the erect position (extensors of the leg), and in those important elements of beauty, a well-developed nose and beard. It is also superior in those points in which it is more embryonic than the other races, viz., the want of prominence of the jaws and cheek-bones, since these are associated with a greater predominance of the cerebral part of the skull, increased size of cerebral hemispheres, and greater intellectual power.He believed that if, &quot;a race was not white then it was inherently more ape-like&quot;. He was opposed to blacks because of their &quot;degrading vices&quot;, believing that the &quot;inferior Negro should go back to Africa&quot; and that their &quot;poor virtue&quot; was inherent. Cope was against the modern view of women&#x27;s rights, believing in the husband&#x27;s role as protector; he was opposed to women&#x27;s suffrage, as he felt they would be unduly influenced by their husbands, and that it would lead to the retrogression of the race as women took on more &quot;masculine&quot; attributes.

== Legacy ==
In fewer than 40 years as a scientist, Cope published over 1,400 scientific papers, a record that is rivaled by few other scientists. His major works include three volumes: &quot;On the Origin of Genera&quot; (1867), &quot;The Vertebrata of the Tertiary Formations of the West&quot; (1884) and &quot;Essays in Evolution&quot;. He discovered a total of 56 new dinosaur species during the Bone Wars compared to Marsh&#x27;s 80. Although Cope is today known as a herpetologist and paleontologist, his contributions extended to ichthyology, in which he cataloged 300 species of fishes and described over 300 species of reptiles over three decades. In total, he discovered and described over 1,000 species of fossil vertebrates and published 600 separate titles. One species of Caribbean snake, &quot;Liophis juliae&quot;, he named in honor of his daughter Julia.

The salamander &quot;Dicamptodon copei&quot; , the dinosaur &quot;Drinker nisti&quot; , the lizards &quot;Alopoglossus copii&quot; , &quot;Gambelia copeii&quot; , &quot;Plestiodon copei&quot; , &quot;Sepsina copei&quot; ,&quot;Sphaerodactylus copei&quot; , the snakes &quot;Thamnophis copei&quot; , &quot;Aspidura copei&quot; , &quot;Cemophora coccinea copei&quot; , &quot;Coniophanes imperialis copei&quot; ,&quot;Dipsas copei&quot; , Cope&#x27;s gray treefrog &quot;Hyla chrysoscelis&quot; Cope, 1880, and the splash tetra genus &quot;Copella&quot; are among the many taxa named in honor of Cope. Currently, 21 fish species named &quot;copei&quot; are distributed among 11 families. Cope lent his name to the &quot;Journal of the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists&quot; (nee &quot;Copeia&quot;) from 1913 to 2020. Cope&#x27;s Pine Street home is recognized as a national landmark.

Cope&#x27;s remains are still kept as scientific specimens. His brain was donated to the American Anthropometric Society and is still preserved in alcohol at the Wistar Institute. His skull is at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. His ashes were placed at the institute with those of Leidy, while his bones were extracted and kept in a locked drawer to be studied by anatomy students. In 1907, Edward Anthony Spitzka published a paper of his analysis of six brains at the American Anthropometric Society, including Cope&#x27;s with additional analysis of Cope&#x27;s skull. In 1993, the American photographer Louie Psihoyos loaned Cope&#x27;s skull and prominently incorporated it into his book &quot;Hunting Dinosaurs&quot; (1994). Psihoyos and his assistant, John Knoebber, traveled around America with Cope&#x27;s skull, taking pictures of the skull in different places on the &quot;adventure&quot; and showing it to various modern paleontologists. Among the notable incidents during the journey was Robert T. Bakker pouring pasta into the skull to measure Cope&#x27;s brain size.

<doc id="415002" wikidata="Q16279853" url="?curid=415002" title="Murderers' Row">
<text>Murderers&#x27; Row were the baseball teams of the New York Yankees in the late 1920s, widely considered some of the best teams in history. The nickname is in particular describing the first six hitters in the 1927 team lineup: Earle Combs, Mark Koenig, Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Bob Meusel, and Tony Lazzeri.

==Etymology==
The term, which mimicked the name applied to a section of the Tombs prison in New York City, was applied to several different baseball teams before it became associated with the Babe Ruth-era Yankees. A 1905 newspaper article about the Yale baseball team notes that one of Yale&#x27;s coaches, Billy Lush, who had been an outfielder with the Cleveland Naps the year before, was &quot;a member of &#x27;Murderer&#x27;s Row,&#x27; as pitchers call the first six batters on the Cleveland list.&quot; The term was also used for the Philadelphia Phillies, the Philadelphia Athletics, and for some minor league and college teams. It was first applied to the Yankees in 1918, two years before Ruth joined the team. Ruth used the term himself in 1920 referring to the Yankees lineup, in his book, &quot;Playing the Game, My Early Years in Baseball.&quot;

==1927 Yankees==
The term was initially associated with the beginning of Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig Yankee teams in the mid-1920s, and is commonly recognized to refer specifically to the core of the 1927 Yankee hitting lineup.

Owner Jacob Ruppert is the man most often credited with building the team, although general manager Ed Barrow may have had as much to do with it. In a game of a July series against the Washington Senators the Yankees won 21–1, prompting Senators&#x27; first baseman Joe Judge to say, &quot;Those fellows not only beat you but they tear your heart out. I wish the season was over.&quot;

===Season results===
The 1927 season was particularly spectacular by baseball standards for the Yankees. After losing in the 1926 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals, they went the next year, won the A.L. pennant by 19 games, and swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in the World Series. Only five teams have won more regular season games: the 1906 Chicago Cubs and the 2001 Seattle Mariners with 116, the 1998 Yankees with 114 and the 1954 Cleveland Indians and 2022 Los Angeles Dodgers with 111. However, the 1998 Yankees, 2001 Mariners, and 2022 Dodgers played eight more games. Both the Cubs and the Indians lost in the World Series, while the Mariners lost to the Yankees in the ALCS and the Dodgers lost to the Padres in the NLDS. The 1998 Yankees went 11–2 in the playoffs, sweeping the San Diego Padres in the World Series.

The 1927 Yankees batted .307, slugged .489, scored 975 runs, and outscored their opponents by a record 376 runs. Center fielder Earle Combs had a career best year, batting .356 with 231 hits, left fielder Bob Meusel batted .337 with 103 RBIs, and second baseman Tony Lazzeri drove in 102 runs. Gehrig batted .373, with 218 hits, 52 doubles, 18 triples, 47 home runs, a then record 175 RBIs, slugged at .765, and was voted A.L. MVP. Ruth amassed a .356 batting average, 164 RBIs, 158 runs scored, walked 137 times, and slugged .772. Most notably, his 60 home runs that year broke his own record and remained the Major League mark for 34 years until Roger Maris broke it by one with 61; however, just like the 1998 Yankees and 2001 Mariners, this was done in a 162-game schedule, a fact that Commissioner Ford Frick, a close friend of Ruth, wanted noted when the single-season home run record was to be referenced.

The 1927 Yankees pitching staff led the league in ERA at 3.20, and included Waite Hoyt (22–7), tied for the league lead in wins, and Herb Pennock at 19–8. Wilcy Moore won 16 as a reliever, and three other Yankee pitchers had ERAs under 3.00 that season.

After sweeping the Pirates in the Series, the Yankees repeated the feat in 1928 by sweeping the Cardinals. They remain the only MLB franchise to sweep consecutive World Series; the Yankee teams of 1938–1939 and 1998–1999 repeated the feat.

===Hall of Fame players===
The 1927 Yankees would eventually send six players along with manager Miller Huggins and president Ed Barrow to the Baseball Hall of Fame. These were Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Hoyt, Lazzeri, Combs, and Pennock. Only the 1928 Yankees had more, with nine players (including infielder Leo Durocher, inducted based on his subsequent managerial accomplishments) along with Huggins and Barrow.

==Legacy==
The term &quot;Murderers&#x27; Row&quot; is commonly used as a descriptor for teams with formidable talent. It has also been used outside of sports, an example being the &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers anchored at Ulithi Atoll, which were also known as Murderer&#x27;s Row.

During the 2006 American League Division Series, Detroit Tigers manager Jim Leyland referred to the 2006 Yankees as &quot;Murderers&#x27; Row and Cano&quot; since the entire lineup consisted of players such as Johnny Damon, Derek Jeter, Bobby Abreu, Gary Sheffield, Hideki Matsui, Alex Rodriguez, Jason Giambi, Jorge Posada and new second baseman Robinson Canó all of whom would have multiple All-Star game appearances over their careers. Despite Leyland&#x27;s nomenclature, the team did not have the success of the original 1927 team as they were defeated by the Tigers in that series.

In 2016, ESPN announced &quot;1927: The Diary of Myles Thomas&quot;. The core of the project is a historical novel in the form of a diary of Myles Thomas, written by Douglas Alden, published along the same timeline as the events unfolded almost 90 years ago. The project was an attempt to relive the 1927 season through Myles Thomas&#x27;s diary entries, additional essays and real-time social-media components (including Twitter, etc). The diary runs the length of the full 1927 season, from April 13 through October 10, 1927.

<text>The Bisaltae () were a Thracian people on the lower Strymon river, who gave their name to Bisaltia, the district between Amphipolis and Heraclea Sintica (the modern village of Rupite, Bulgaria) on the east and Crestonice on the west. They also made their way into the peninsulas of Acte and Pallene in the south, beyond the river Nestus in the east, and are even said to have raided Cardia.
Between the 470s and 450s BC they issued large silver coins, which depict a naked horseman standing next to a horse and wearing a petasos hat, and the name of the tribe in the Parian-Thasian alphabet. These coins weighed 29 grammes each and were by far the largest of a number of similar coins issued by Macedonian and Thracian tribes in this period, numbering perhaps half a million coins (ca. 14,500 kilogrammes of silver). The source of the silver was probably a silver mine at Lake Prasias, near Mount Dysorum, which is mentioned by Herodotus. Under a separate king at the time of the Persian Wars, they were annexed by Alexander I (498 BC-454 BC) to the kingdom of Macedon. He continued to mint coinage from the silver mine at Lake Prasias, using the same coinage designs as the previous Bisaltian coinage. At the division of Macedon into four districts by the Romans after the battle of Pydna (168) the Bisaltae were included in Macedonia Prima.

Plutarch, in his &quot;Life of Perikles&quot;, says that the Athenians established a colony (&quot;cleruchy&quot;)&quot;a thousand to dwell among the Thracian tribe of the Bisaltae.&quot; This colony was meant to strengthen Athen&#x27;s hold over the wealthy region around Amphipolis, which would become a major battleground in the Peloponnesian War.

Their country was rich in figs, vines and olive trees; the silver mines in the mountain range of Dysorum brought in a talent a day to their conqueror Alexander. The Bisaltae are referred to by Virgil in connection with the treatment of the diseases of sheep. The fact that their eponym is said to have been the son of Helios and Ge points to a very early settlement in the district.

<text>Dan Norris (born 28 January 1960) is a British politician who has served as Mayor of the West of England since 2021. A member of the Labour Party, he has served as Member of Parliament (MP) for North East Somerset and Hanham since 2024, having represented Wansdyke, one of its predecessor constituencies, from 1997 to 2010.

Norris served in government as the Parliamentary-Under Secretary of State for Rural Affairs and Environment from 2009 to 2010, and an Assistant Whip from 2001 to 2003. Norris was elected to Parliament for North East Somerset and Hanham in the 2024 general election, defeating Jacob Rees-Mogg.

==Early life==
Norris was born on 28 January 1960 in London to David and June Norris. June was a Labour councillor who contested the Northavon constituency at the 1983 and 1992 general elections. David was a sales manager and social worker.

Norris was educated at Chipping Sodbury School and the University of Sussex, where he received a Master of Arts in Social Work in 1988. He worked as a teacher and child protection officer, having trained with the NSPCC.

==Before parliament==
Norris was a councillor on Bristol City Council for the Brislington West ward from 1989 to 1992 and from 1995 to 1997, and a councillor on Avon County Council from 1994 to 1996. He is a member of the GMB trade union.

==First Parliamentary career==
Norris first stood for parliament in the constituency of Northavon in 1987, losing against the Conservative incumbent, John Cope. In 1992, he was the Labour candidate for Wansdyke in Somerset, coming in second place against the Conservative incumbent, Jack Aspinwall. He contested the Wansdyke seat again in the election of 1997, and this time succeeded in taking it with a majority of 4,799, overturning a Conservative majority of 11,770 votes. Norris went on to increase his majority to 5,613 in the election of 2001.

Norris has a particular interest in child safety and regularly campaigns against child sexual abuse, having co-written a free booklet on its prevention. He also co-wrote, produced and distributed a booklet, &quot;Don&#x27;t Bully Me,&quot; giving practical advice to children across the United Kingdom on dealing with bullying.

Norris was an assistant whip for the Treasury from June 2001 to June 2003. In May 2006 he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Hain until June 2007, then PPS to Foreign Secretary David Miliband to January 2009. In the reshuffle of June 2009, Norris entered government as a minister for the first time, becoming Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Minister for Rural Affairs and Environment).

Norris had long campaigned against fox hunting, supporting the legislation outlawing it. On the final day of legal fox hunting, 28 February 2005, he was accosted by Duke of Beaufort&#x27;s Hunt supporters in an incident at Badminton which was shown live on regional television news.

The 2005 general election saw his lead over the Conservatives fall to 1,839. In changes made by the Boundary Commission for England, the Wansdyke constituency underwent moderate boundary changes and was renamed North East Somerset ahead of the 2010 election. Norris stood in the new seat but was defeated by the Conservative candidate Jacob Rees-Mogg.

==After first spell in Parliament==
Following his defeat at the 2010 general election, Norris worked for David Miliband in his unsuccessful bid for the Labour leadership. In May 2012, Norris was shortlisted to be the Labour Party candidate for the Bristol mayoral election, but did not win the selection. In 2016 he was head of operations for the Russell Group of universities, and he has run businesses. Norris was critical of Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership of the Labour Party&#x27;s handling of antisemitism, stating in an op-ed for the &quot;Bristol Post&quot;, &quot;today’s Labour leadership seems to have become highly uncomfortable in opposing racism when it is directed at Jewish people&quot;.

In 2004, Norris was appointed to the board of the Snowdon Trust, a charity that supports students with physical disabilities. Norris is an ambassador for the children&#x27;s charity Kidscape. He is a trustee of the League Against Cruel Sports, becoming chair in October 2022.

== Mayor of the West of England ==

=== Candidacy ===
Norris was selected as the Labour Party candidate on 16 November 2020, defeating Bristol councillor Helen Godwin in a vote of local members by 1,611 votes to 1,558. During the election campaign, the leader of the Labour Party Keir Starmer visited Bath to campaign with him. They were asked to leave a pub by its landlord, who opposed the use of lockdowns as part of the government&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

During the election campaign, Norris said that incumbent mayor Tim Bowles was the &quot;only metro mayor who doesn&#x27;t have more powers than when he started&quot;, and that if elected he would seek more money and powers from central government. He said he would establish a &quot;Green Recovery Fund&quot; to create 23,000 jobs by investing in &quot;home retrofitting, tree-planting, flood and drought defences, and renewable energy&quot;.

=== Mayoralty ===
Norris was elected as the mayor of the West of England in the 2021 mayoral election, a role which had previously been held by the Conservative Tim Bowles. Upon taking office, he became entitled to the style of Mayor. He credited his victory to the leadership of Keir Starmer. He said he would support North Somerset and parts of Somerset joining the combined authority, and he would seek additional funds for them.

In his first public meeting of the West of England Combined Authority (WECA), Norris vetoed a proposal supported by the leaders of the three constituent councils to spend £100,000 reviewing how the authority functions and makes decisions. At a meeting in July, Norris and the council leaders rejected most of a climate action plan that the authority had been developing since 2019 as insufficiently ambitious, and agreed to begin developing a replacement. Also in July 2021, Norris launched new schemes to support the creative and food industries in the region.

In the October 2021 budget, the UK government allocated £540 million to WECA over a five-year period for public transport improvements, to predominantly be spent on improving bus services. This included £48 million for a park and ride scheme near the M32 strategic corridor from South Gloucestershire to Bristol. The funding is from the Department for Transport&#x27;s City Region Sustainable Transport Settlements scheme.

There was a dispute between WECA members and Norris over the mayor&#x27;s powers, in particular a power to veto alternative proposals to their joint committee which included North Somerset Council. The four local authorities’ monitoring officers, who give legal advice, stated the veto could arguably amount to maladministration. On 15 October 2021, the four council leaders did not attend a WECA meeting with the mayor, which meant over £50 million of spending decisions could not be made. Norris stated &quot;I would agree that [my predecessor] gave into them, I am not prepared to do that ... I’m not really bothered about procedures or legal arguments, frankly. I’m determined to get policies through and things delivered.&quot; A former non-voting member of WECA, Vice-Chancellor of the University of the West of England Professor Steve West, was appointed as mediator in the dispute. In November 2021, after taking new legal advice, Norris agreed not to claim veto powers on decisions involving North Somerset.

In November 2021, the combined authority submitted a plan for a &quot;seamless&quot; public transport system with a single brand and payment system across buses and trains and across different operators. South Gloucestershire Council asked for funding from WECA for a pedestrianisation scheme on Thornbury&#x27;s high street, which Norris threatened to withhold unless the council further consulted residents. In the same month, Norris signed WECA up to a charter committing to support staff diagnosed with terminal illness, and urged organisations across the West of England to do likewise. He supported a strike by the University and College Union in Bristol in December 2021.

====Spatial Development Strategy====
A major responsibility of WECA and the mayor is the development of a Spatial Development Strategy (SDS), which will guide major planning decisions in the area and thus development direction. A somewhat similar Joint Spatial Plan was previously being developed by the area&#x27;s unitary authorities in a four-year process, and included building three new &quot;garden villages&quot;. In 2019, the plan was withdrawn after the Planning Inspectorate criticised it as not &quot;robust, consistent or objective&quot;. Consequently, producing a SDS for WECA to agree became a priority for the new mayor. The SDS covers the period to 2041, and was to have a 12-week public consultation before a public examination by the Planning Inspectorate in early 2023.

In March 2022, Norris stated that the region&#x27;s green belt was &quot;not fit for purpose&quot;. He argued that there should be no overall green belt area reduction, but limited changes to extend urban areas in a few places should be permitted. At the time, there was a proposal by the owners of Bristol&#x27;s Ashton Gate Stadium to build 500 homes on the neighbouring green belt as part of a &quot;sporting quarter&quot; development.

The mayor and the leader of South Gloucestershire council disputed the amount of new housing proposed in WECA&#x27;s forthcoming SDS, publication of which was deferred. In May 2022, Norris told the government that agreement of a SDS was impossible, blaming South Gloucestershire council for leaving discussions, which was denied by South Gloucestershire&#x27;s leader. Subsequently, the three councils started developing their own individual Local Plans, which Norris had described as parochial.

== Return to Parliament ==
In July 2024, Norris was elected to Parliament at the 2024 general election for North East Somerset and Hanham, which covered largely the same area as his former Wansdyke constituency, defeating Jacob Rees-Mogg in a rematch of their 2010 contest. He continued to hold the office of mayor of the West of England, although under &quot;second job&quot; rule changes implemented by the Labour Party in September 2024, he would not be able to stand for re-election as mayor in May 2025.

<text>John Douglas Naysmith (1 April 1941 – 2 July 2023) was a British Labour Co-operative politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Bristol North West from 1997 until standing down at the 2010 general election.

==Early life==
Doug Naysmith was born in Musselburgh, Scotland, and attended the local Burgh School before attending the independent George Heriot&#x27;s School in Edinburgh. He went on to study at the University of Edinburgh where he was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in Zoology before going on to complete a Doctorate in Immunology. He went on to research at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, United States.

From 1970 he worked as a research immunologist at Beecham Research Laboratory until 1972 when he became a Research Fellow at the University of Bristol, he remained at Bristol until his election to Parliament, becoming a Fellow in 1976 and a lecturer in the Pathology Department in 1981.

==Parliamentary career==
Naysmith unsuccessfully contested the seat of Bristol at the 1979 European Parliament election. He was elected to Bristol City Council in 1981 and remained a Council member until he stood down in 1998. He also served as the Chairman of the Port of Bristol Authority from 1986 until 1991. He first stood for Parliament at the 1987 General Election for Cirencester and Tewkesbury, where he was defeated by the then Secretary of State for the Environment Nicholas Ridley. He contested Bristol North West at the 1992 General Election when he lost out by a margin of just 45 votes to the sitting Conservative MP, Michael Stern.

Naysmith was elected to Parliament at the 1997 General Election defeating Stern by a substantial 11,382 votes. However, on 25 January 2007, he announced his intention to stand down at the 2010 general election due to his advancing age.

During his time in Parliament, Naysmith was largely loyal to the government. Though he abstained in the Parliamentary vote authorizing British military involvement in the Iraq War in 2003 and voted against the introduction of Foundation Hospitals, he joined with the government in voting for the introduction of top-up fees, helping Prime Minister Blair secure an extremely narrow 5 vote majority (316-311). In 2004 he voted for an outright ban on fox hunting in England and Wales, which passed the House of Commons by a substantial margin.

Naysmith took an active interest in health issues, was joint Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party Health Committee and was a member of many all party groups related to health matters. He was a long-standing member of the Socialist Health Association. Naysmith was a member of two select committees: Health and Regulatory Reform, and he campaigned successfully to persuade the Government to propose the comprehensive smoking ban which came into force in July 2007. Other political interests include ports and shipping, science, higher education and Co-operative development. He was Chair of the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee and secretary of the Parliamentary Universities Group. He was also President of mental health charity The Dementia Care Trust.

==After Parliament==
Although Naysmith stood down from Parliament at the 2010 general election, he stood as a candidate for the Labour party in the Bristol City Council local elections, winning the Avonmouth seat from the Conservatives. The number of votes cast for him and his Conservative opponent was the same and the result was decided by the returning officer drawing Naysmith&#x27;s name from a ballot box. He stood down in 2013.

Naysmith died on 2 July 2023, at the age of 82.

<doc id="415014" wikidata="Q5386775" url="?curid=415014" title="Eric Illsley">
<text>Eric Evlyn Illsley (born 9 April 1955) is a former British Labour politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Barnsley Central from 1987 until 2011. He was a Labour Party representative until suspended from the party after being charged with false accounting as part of the United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal, and then sat as an Independent. When he pleaded guilty to three counts of false accounting on 11 January 2011, he became the first sitting Member of Parliament to be convicted of a criminal offence in the scandal.
Illsley resigned from the House of Commons on 8 February 2011, following his conviction, and was sentenced to 12 months&#x27; imprisonment on 10 February 2011.

==Early life==
Illsley was born in Kendray, West Riding of Yorkshire and educated at Hunningley Lane Junior School, Barnsley&#x27;s Holgate Grammar School for Boys and the University of Leeds, where he obtained an honours degree in Law in 1977. He was an official for the NUM for ten years, including during the miners&#x27; strike of 1984–1985. In the NUM, he was a compensation officer from 1978 to 1981, assistant head of general department from 1981 to 1984, and head of general department and chief administration officer from 1984 to 1987.

==Political career==
When former Northern Ireland Secretary Roy Mason announced his retirement in October 1986, Illsley was nominated by the NUM in the selection of a Labour candidate for Barnsley Central. He was viewed as being on the left of the Labour Party while his main opponent was Ronnie Fisher, a Barnsley Borough councillor identified as a moderate. The general secretary of the Yorkshire NUM, Sam Thompson, wrote to NUM members encouraging them to attend the selection meeting in January 1987, Illsley was selected and then easily elected to the House of Commons in the general election in June 1987. He was on the frontbench while Labour were in opposition, but was a backbencher after they won power in 1997. He voted against the privatisation of the National Air Traffic Services (NATS).

On 11 March 2003, Illsley claimed in a speech to the House, regarding possible military action in Iraq: &quot;The report states that any military action must be on the basis of UN resolutions. I fully agree: as a Committee member, I stand by that statement, and believe that there must be a second resolution before any military action is taken against Iraq&quot;. One week later following failed attempts to agree a UN resolution he voted in favour of an amendment to a Government motion to prevent military action against Iraq until such a resolution was agreed. When the amendment was defeated he voted in favour of the Government motion as it had been deliberately worded to include the line &quot;offers wholehearted support to the men and women of Her Majesty&#x27;s Armed Forces now on duty in the Middle East&quot;; and a vote against the resolution was regarded as criticism of the Armed forces. He voted in favour of the introduction of identity cards in the UK.

===Expenses===
Illsley voted against a bill proposing transparency in MPs&#x27; allowances and the publication of a list of allowed expenses, otherwise known as the John Lewis List. Illsley claimed £149,700 in expenses including £90,000 staff costs.

On 19 June 2009 he was one of dozens of MPs identified by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as having made &quot;phantom&quot; claims for council tax on his parliamentary expenses, receiving thousands of pounds more than he was entitled to. He was thought to have made the highest phantom claim—over £6,000. He has claimed over £10,000 for council tax in four years although he was charged £3,966 for his Band C property in Lambeth, south London, in this period. He regularly submitted claims for £200 a month, which meant that he did not have to submit receipts.

Shortly after re-election as a Labour MP in the 2010 general election, on 19 May 2010, Illsley was charged with three counts of false accounting. He was suspended from the Labour Party and had the Labour whip withdrawn in the House of Commons. On 11 January 2011, he pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court to three charges. He was to be sentenced in February 2011 and if he received a prison sentence of more than 12 months, he would have been automatically disqualified as a member of parliament under the Representation of the People Act 1981, causing a by-election at Barnsley Central. Illsley stated his intention to resign as an MP before sentencing, and on 8 February he was formally appointed Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds, vacating his seat. A by-election followed on 3 March 2011. He was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment on 10 February 2011, and was released on 13 May 2011 after serving three months. He wore an electronic tag for the remainder of his term.

On 13 October 2011, he appeared on BBC &quot;Newsnight&quot; on which he described his inflated expenses claims as &quot;an allowance for living in London&quot;. He also revealed that he receives a Parliamentary pension, although he refused to disclose the amount.

<doc id="415016" wikidata="Q831050" url="?curid=415016" title="Blood substitute">
<text>A blood substitute (also called artificial blood or blood surrogate) is a substance used to mimic and fulfill some functions of biological blood. It aims to provide an alternative to blood transfusion, which is transferring blood or blood-based products from one person into another. Thus far, there are no well-accepted &quot;oxygen-carrying&quot; blood substitutes, which is the typical objective of a red blood cell transfusion; however, there are widely available non-blood volume expanders for cases where only volume restoration is required. These are helping doctors and surgeons avoid the risks of disease transmission and immune suppression, address the chronic blood donor shortage, and address the concerns of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and others who have religious objections to receiving transfused blood.

The main categories of &quot;oxygen-carrying&quot; blood substitutes being pursued are hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOC) and perfluorocarbon emulsions. Oxygen therapeutics are in clinical trials in the U.S. and European Union, and Hemopure is available in South Africa.

==History==
After William Harvey discovered blood pathways in 1616, many people tried to use fluids such as beer, urine, milk, and non-human animal blood as blood substitute. Sir Christopher Wren suggested wine and opium as blood substitute.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the development of modern transfusion medicine initiated through the work of Landsteiner and co-authors opened the possibility to understanding the general principle of blood group serology. Simultaneously, significant progress was made in the fields of heart and circulation physiology as well as in the understanding of the mechanism of oxygen transport and tissue oxygenation.

Restrictions in applied transfusion medicine, especially in disaster situations such as World War II, laid the grounds for accelerated research in the field of blood substitutes. Early attempts and optimism in developing blood substitutes were very quickly confronted with significant side effects, which could not be promptly eliminated due to the level of knowledge and technology available at that time. The emergence of HIV in the 1980s renewed impetus for development of infection-safe blood substitutes. Public concern about the safety of the blood supply was raised further by mad cow disease. The continuous decline of blood donation combined with the increased demand for blood transfusion (increased ageing of population, increased incidence of invasive diagnostic, chemotherapy and extensive surgical interventions, terror attacks, international military conflicts) and positive estimation of investors in biotechnology branch made for a positive environment for further development of blood substitutes.

Efforts to develop blood substitutes have been driven by a desire to replace blood transfusion in emergency situations, in places where infectious disease is endemic and the risk of contaminated blood products is high, where refrigeration to preserve blood may be lacking, and where it might not be possible or convenient to find blood type matches.

In 2023, DARPA announced funding twelve universities and labs for synthetic blood research. Human trials would be expected to happen between 2028-2030.

==Approaches==
Efforts have focused on molecules that can carry oxygen, and most work has focused on recombinant hemoglobin, which normally carries oxygen, and perfluorocarbons (PFC), chemical compounds which can carry and release oxygen.

The first approved oxygen-carrying blood substitute was a perfluorocarbon-based product called Fluosol-DA-20, manufactured by Green Cross of Japan. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1989. Because of limited success, complexity of use and side effects, it was withdrawn in 1994. However, Fluosol-DA remains the only oxygen therapeutic ever fully approved by the FDA. As of 2017 no hemoglobin-based product had been approved.

===Perfluorocarbon based===

Perfluorochemicals are not water soluble and will not mix with blood, therefore emulsions must be made by dispersing small drops of PFC in water. This liquid is then mixed with antibiotics, vitamins, nutrients and salts, producing a mixture that contains about 80 different components, and performs many of the vital functions of natural blood. PFC particles are about the size of the diameter of a red blood cell (RBC). This small size can enable PFC particles to traverse capillaries through which no RBCs are flowing. In theory this can benefit damaged, blood-starved tissue, which conventional red cells cannot reach. PFC solutions can carry oxygen so well that mammals, including humans, can survive breathing liquid PFC solution, called liquid breathing.

Perfluorocarbon-based blood substitutes are completely man-made; this provides advantages over blood substitutes that rely on modified hemoglobin, such as unlimited manufacturing capabilities, ability to be heat-sterilized, and PFCs&#x27; efficient oxygen delivery and carbon dioxide removal. PFCs in solution act as an intravascular oxygen carrier to temporarily augment oxygen delivery to tissues. PFCs are removed from the bloodstream within 48 hours by the body&#x27;s normal clearance procedure for particles in the blood – exhalation. PFC particles in solution can carry several times more oxygen per cubic centimeter (cc) than blood, while being 40 to 50 times smaller than hemoglobin.

Fluosol was made mostly of perfluorodecalin or perfluorotributylamine suspended in an albumin emulsion. It was developed in Japan and first tested in the United States in November 1979. In order to &quot;load&quot; sufficient amounts of oxygen into it, people who had been given it had to breathe pure oxygen by mask or in a hyperbaric chamber. It was approved by the FDA in 1989, and was approved in eight other countries. Its use was associated with a reduction in ischemic complications and with an increase in pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure. Due to difficulty with the emulsion storage of Fluosol use (frozen storage and rewarming), its popularity declined and its production ended in 1994.

Oxygent was a second-generation, lecithin-stabilized emulsion of a PFC that was under development by Alliance Pharmaceuticals. In 2002 a Phase III study was halted early due an increase in incidences of strokes in the study arm.

===Haemoglobin based===
Haemoglobin is the main component of red blood cells, comprising about 33% of the cell mass. Haemoglobin-based products are called haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs).

Unmodified cell-free haemoglobin is not useful as a blood substitute because its oxygen affinity is too high for effective tissue oxygenation, the half-life within the intravascular space that is too short to be clinically useful, it has a tendency to undergo dissociation in dimers with resultant kidney damage and toxicity, and because free haemoglobin tends to take up nitric oxide, causing vasoconstriction.

Efforts to overcome this toxicity have included making genetically engineered versions, cross-linking, polymerization, and encapsulation.

HemAssist, a diaspirin cross-linked haemoglobin (DCLHb) was developed by Baxter Healthcare; it was the most widely studied of the haemoglobin-based blood substitutes, used in more than a dozen animal and clinical studies. It reached Phase III clinical trials, in which it failed due to increased mortality in the trial arm, mostly due to severe vasoconstriction complications. The results were published in 1999.

Hemolink (Hemosol Inc., Mississauga, Canada) was a haemoglobin solution that contained cross-linked an o-rafinose polymerised human haemoglobin. Hemosol struggled after Phase II trials were halted in 2003 on safety concerns and declared bankruptcy in 2005.

Hemopure was developed by Biopure Corp and was a chemically stabilized, cross-linked bovine (cow) haemoglobin in a salt solution intended for human use; the company developed the same product under the trade name Oxyglobin for veterinary use in dogs. Oxyglobin was approved in the US and Europe and was introduced to veterinary clinics and hospitals in March 1998. Hemopure was approved in South Africa and Russia. Biopure filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009. Its assets were subsequently purchased by HbO2 Therapeutics in 2014.

PolyHeme was developed over 20 years by Northfield Laboratories and began as a military project following the Vietnam War. It is human haemoglobin, extracted from red blood cells, then polymerized, then incorporated into an electrolyte solution. In April 2009, the FDA rejected Northfield&#x27;s Biologic License Application and in June 2009, Northfield filed for bankruptcy.

Dextran-Haemoglobin was developed by Dextro-Sang Corp as a veterinary product, and was a conjugate of the polymer dextran with human haemoglobin.

Hemotech was developed by HemoBiotech and was a chemically modified haemoglobin.

Somatogen developed a genetically engineered and crosslinked tetramer it called Optro. It failed in a phase II trial and development was halted.

A pyridoxylated Hb conjugated with polyoxyethylene was created by scientists at Ajinomoto and eventually developed by Apex Biosciences, a subsidiary of Curacyte AG; it was called &quot;PHP&quot; and failed in a Phase III trial published in 2014, due to increased mortality in the control arm, which led to Curacyte shutting down.

Similarly, Hemospan was developed by Sangart, and was a pegylated haemoglobin provided in a powdered form. While early trials were promising Sangart ran out of funding and closed down.

===Stem cells===
Stem cells offer a possible means of producing transfusable blood. A study performed by Giarratana et al. describes a large-scale ex-vivo production of mature human blood cells using hematopoietic stem cells. The cultured cells possessed the same haemoglobin content and morphology as native red blood cells. The authors contend that the cells had a near-normal lifespan, when compared to natural red blood cells.

Scientists from the experimental arm of the United States Department of Defense began creating artificial blood for use in remote areas and transfuse blood to wounded soldiers more quickly in 2010. The blood is made from the hematopoietic stem cells removed from the umbilical cord between human mother and newborn using a method called blood pharming. Pharming has been used in the past on animals and plants to create medical substances in large quantities. Each cord can produce approximately 20 units of blood. The blood is being produced for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency by Arteriocyte. The Food and Drug Administration has examined and approved the safety of this blood from previously submitted O-negative blood. Using this particular artificial blood will reduce the costs per unit of blood from $5,000 to equal or less than $1,000. This blood will also serve as a blood donor to all common blood types.

<text>Bugsy and Mugsy is a 1957 Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. 
The short was released on August 31, 1957, and stars Bugs Bunny, with Rocky and Mugsy. Bugs discovers that two robbers are hiding out on the floor above him, and plays them off against each other. The cartoon is a remake of the 1950 &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; short &quot;Stooge for a Mouse&quot;, in which a mouse pitted Sylvester and Mike (a bulldog) against each other in the same way.

<text>Gisela Stuart, Baroness Stuart of Edgbaston (&quot;née&quot; Gschaider; born 26 November 1955) is a British-German politician and life peer who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Birmingham Edgbaston from 1997 to 2017. A former member of the Labour Party, she now sits as a crossbencher in the House of Lords.

Born and raised in West Germany, Stuart moved to the United Kingdom in 1974. Elected for Birmingham Edgbaston at the 1997 general election, she was chair of the Vote Leave Campaign Committee and was one of its most high-profile figures, along with the Conservative MPs Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. The Vote Leave campaign was successful in achieving its goal at the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum of winning a majority of votes for Leave. From 2016 to 2020, she served as chair of Vote Leave&#x27;s successor organisation, Change Britain.

After she had left Parliament, Stuart was appointed by the Conservative government as chair of Wilton Park, an executive agency of the UK Foreign Office dedicated to conflict resolution in international relations, in October 2018. She is a member of the Steering Committee of the Constitution Reform Group (CRG), a cross-party organisation chaired by Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury, which seeks a new constitutional settlement in the UK by way of a new Act of Union. The Constitution Reform Group&#x27;s new Act of Union Bill was introduced as a Private Member&#x27;s Bill on 9 October 2018.

Baroness Stuart was appointed as the First Civil Service Commissioner in March 2022.

==Early life==
Gisela Gschaider was born in Velden, Bavaria, West Germany on 26 November 1955 to Martin and Liane Gschaider. She attended the Staatliche Realschule in Vilsbiburg. After doing an apprenticeship in bookselling, she moved to the UK in 1974 in order to improve her English and to do a Business Studies course at Manchester Polytechnic. She was deputy director of the 1983 London Book Fair. Stuart subsequently relocated to the Midlands.

She graduated from the University of London with an LLB in 1993, having studied through the University of London External System. She began researching for a PhD in trust law (ownership of pension funds) at the University of Birmingham while she also lectured Law to AAT students at Worcestershire College, but did not complete her PhD and instead went into politics full-time.

In 1994, as Gisela Gschaider, Stuart contested the Worcester and South Warwickshire seat at the European elections for Labour. She lost by 1,000 votes.

==Parliamentary career==
In 1995, Stuart was selected as Labour&#x27;s parliamentary candidate for the Birmingham Edgbaston constituency. The constituency, which had once been held by former Conservative Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (1937–40), had returned only Conservative MPs for 99 years. The sitting Conservative MP at the time, Dame Jill Knight, was retiring after 31 years. On 1 May 1997, Stuart was elected as the first-ever Labour MP for the constituency, making it one of a succession of traditional Conservative seats to fall to Labour control in a landslide victory for the party. Stuart&#x27;s victory was the first televised Labour gain of the evening.

During the First Blair ministry, Stuart served on the Social Security Select Committee and in 1998 as PPS to Home Office Minister of State Paul Boateng, before joining the government in 1999 as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health. Stuart left this post in the reshuffle that followed after the 2001 election. Her election agent in that election was John Clancy, who became Leader of Birmingham City Council in 2015.

In Blair&#x27;s second ministry, Stuart was appointed as one of the UK Parliamentary Representatives to the European Convention, which was tasked with drawing up a new constitution for the European Union. In this capacity, Stuart also served as one of the thirteen members of the Convention&#x27;s Presidium – the steering group responsible for managing the business of the Convention and which drafted the text of the constitution then approved by the full Convention.

After the draft Constitution emerged, Stuart became one of the most trenchant critics of the proposal, stating that it had been drawn up by a &quot;self-selected group of the European political elite&quot; determined to deepen European integration. She subsequently expounded these views in a 2004 Fabian Society pamphlet, &quot;The Making of Europe&#x27;s Constitution&quot;. Consequently, she argued in favour of British withdrawal from the European Union, becoming one of the leading Eurosceptic figures in the Labour Party. These views were countered in a rebuttal by the European Parliamentary Labour Party spokesman on EU constitutional affairs published on-line by the Fabians and in a pamphlet published by the Labour Movement for Europe.

In October 2004, she became the only Labour MP who openly supported the re-election of George W. Bush at that year&#x27;s U.S. presidential election, arguing &quot;you know where you stand with George and, in today&#x27;s world, that&#x27;s much better than rudderless leaders who drift with the prevailing wind&quot;. She wrote that a victory for Democratic Party challenger, John Kerry, would prompt &quot;victory celebrations among those who want to destroy liberal democracies. More terrorists and suicide bombers would step forward to become martyrs in their quest to destroy the West&quot;.

Between 2001 and 2010, Stuart also served as a member of the House of Commons Select Committee on Foreign Affairs.

She retained her seat at the 2005 election but her majority was halved in both percentage and numerical terms. Despite the predictions of the pundits, Stuart went on to retain the seat at the 2010 general election, against a national tide of Labour defeat. The election resulted in the first hung parliament in 36 years, with the Conservatives having the most seats. It earned her the title of Survivor of the Year at &quot;The Spectator&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2010 Parliamentarian of the Year awards, which was presented to her by the new Conservative Prime Minister, David Cameron. She retained her seat at the 2015 election with a majority of 2,706 votes, more than double her majority from 2010. She joined the Commons Select Committee on Defence.

Stuart is a signatory of the Henry Jackson Society principles, which promote the spread of liberal democracy across the world and the maintenance of a strong military with global expeditionary reach.

She was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 2015, giving her the honorific title &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life.

Since 2015, Stuart has been a Steering Committee member of the Constitution Reform Group (CRG), a cross-party pressure group of current and former politicians, academics, constitutional law experts, former officials in Parliament and government and ordinary citizens. The CRG seeks a new constitutional settlement in the UK by way of a new Act of Union. The Constitution Reform Group&#x27;s new Act of Union Bill was introduced as a Private Member&#x27;s Bill by Lord Lisvane in the House of Lords on 9 October 2018, when it received a formal first reading. The BBC described the Bill as &quot;one to watch&quot; in that Parliament.

She announced on 19 April 2017 that she would not seek re-election at the 2017 snap general election. She was succeeded by Preet Gill, a Labour and Co-operative politician, and the first female British Sikh MP.

In 2019, Stuart announced she would vote for the Conservative Party in the 2019 general election. She remained a member of the Labour Party after the election.

In the 2019 Dissolution Honours, Stuart was given a life peerage; she initially sat as a non-affiliated peer before becoming a crossbencher.

==Vote Leave==
Stuart served as Chair of Vote Leave, the body which was designated by the Electoral Commission as the official campaign in favour of leaving the European Union in the 2016 referendum on European Union membership. Other spokespersons for Vote Leave included Conservative MPs Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. There were various other groups advocating for Leave, officially working independently of Vote Leave, including UKIP and the Labour Leave.

In the BBC&#x27;s two-hour televised debate on the EU referendum, Stuart appeared on the &quot;Leave&quot; panel, along with the Conservative MPs Andrea Leadsom and Boris Johnson.

Stuart&#x27;s own constituency of Birmingham Edgbaston voted to Remain in the EU.

After stepping down at the 2017 general election, Stuart revealed that she had pushed for an exit clause in the European Constitution, which later became Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. Article 50 allows for withdrawal from the European Union by any member state and was invoked for the first and only time by Prime Minister Theresa May on 29 March 2017.

==Outside of politics==
In 2016, Stuart became the sixth President of the Birmingham Bach Choir.

Stuart became the chair of Wilton Park, an executive agency of the UK Foreign Office dedicated to conflict resolution in international relations, on 1 October 2018. From 2020-2022 Stuart was the lead non-executive board member of the Cabinet Office. She was appointed as First Civil Service Commissioner in March 2022.

Stuart was appointed an Honorary Captain in the Royal Naval Reserve in July 2021.

In 2021, Stuart was appointed chair of the Royal Mint Advisory Committee for a term of five years from 1 March 2021 to 28 February 2026.

==Personal life==
She is a Catholic. She has two sons. She married Robert Stuart in 1980, and they divorced in 2000. She then married Derek Scott in 2010. Scott died in 2012.

<text>The Tri-Cities is the region comprising the cities of Kingsport, Johnson City, and Bristol and the surrounding smaller towns and communities in Northeast Tennessee and Southwest Virginia. All three cities are located in Northeast Tennessee, while Bristol has a twin city of the same name in Virginia.

The Tri-Cities region was formerly a single Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA); due to the U.S. Census Bureau&#x27;s revised definitions of urban areas in the early 2000s, it is now a Combined Statistical Area (CSA) with two metropolitan components: Johnson City and Kingsport–Bristol, TN–VA. However, the Tri-Cities are usually still considered one population center, which is the fifth-largest in Tennessee.

<doc id="415024" wikidata="Q57372" url="?curid=415024" title="Joachim Fest">
<text>Joachim Clemens Fest (8 December 1926 – 11 September 2006) was a German historian, journalist, critic and editor who was best known for his writings and public commentary on Nazi Germany, including a biography of Adolf Hitler and books about Albert Speer and German resistance to Nazism. He was a leading figure in the debate among German historians about the Nazi era. In recent years his writings have earned both praise and strong criticism.

==Early life and career==
Fest was born in the Karlshorst locality of Berlin, the son of Johannes Fest, a conservative Roman Catholic and staunch anti-Nazi schoolteacher who was dismissed from his post when the Nazis came to power in 1933. In 1936, when Fest turned 10, his family refused to make him join the Hitler Youth, a step that could have had serious repercussions for the family although membership became compulsory only in 1939. As it was, Fest was expelled from his school and then went to a Catholic boarding school in Freiburg im Breisgau in Baden, where he was able to avoid Hitler Youth service until he was 18.

In December 1944, when he turned 18, Fest decided to enlist in the Wehrmacht, mainly to avoid being conscripted into the Waffen-SS. His father opposed even that concession by saying that &quot;one does not volunteer for Hitler&#x27;s criminal war&quot;. His military service in the Second World War was brief and ended when he surrendered in France. After the war, he studied law, history, sociology, German literature and art history at the University of Freiburg, in Frankfurt am Main and in Berlin.

After he had graduated, he started working for the American-run Berlin radio station RIAS (Radio in the American Sector). There, from 1954 to 1961, he was the editor in charge of contemporary history and was asked to present radio portraits of the main historical personalities who had influenced the course of German history from Otto von Bismarck to the Second World War, including leading figures of the Nazi regime such as Heinrich Himmler and Joseph Goebbels. The portraits were later published as his first book, &quot;The Face of the Third Reich: Portraits of the Nazi Leadership&quot;.

In 1961, Fest was appointed editor-in-chief of television for the North German broadcasting service Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) in which he was also responsible for the political television magazine &quot;Panorama&quot;.

==Career in writing==
Fest then embarked on his biography of Adolf Hitler, published in 1973. The first major biography of Hitler since that of Alan Bullock in 1952 and the first by a German writer, it appeared at a time when the younger generation of Germans was confronting the legacy of the Nazi period. It sparked controversy among German historians, because Fest, a political conservative, rejected the then dominant view that the causes of Hitler&#x27;s rise to power had been largely economic. He instead believed that the Third Reich&#x27;s rise to power was the result of millions of Germans turning a blind eye to Hitler or actively supporting him.

Fest explained Hitler&#x27;s success in terms of what he called the &quot;great fear&quot; that had overcome the German middle classes, as a result not only of Bolshevism and First World War dislocation but also more broadly in response to rapid modernization, which had led to a romantic longing for a lost past. That led to resentment of other groups, especially Jews, which were seen as agents of modernity. It also made many Germans susceptible to a figure such as Hitler who could articulate their mood. &quot;He was never only their leader, he was always their voice... the people, as if electrified, recognised themselves in him&quot;.

In 1977, Fest directed a documentary entitled &quot;&quot;. Fest&#x27;s film, which aimed to explain why ordinary people in Germany loved Hitler, created some controversy among some critics such as the American historian Deborah Lipstadt, who wrote that by featuring extensive clips of Hitler from propaganda films and totally ignoring the Holocaust, Fest had engaged in the glorification of a murderer.

Fest served as the editorial aide for Albert Speer, Hitler&#x27;s court architect and later Minister for Munitions, while Speer worked on his autobiography, &quot;Inside the Third Reich&quot; (1970). After Speer&#x27;s death, amid controversy over the reliability of the memoirs, Fest wrote &quot;Speer: The Final Verdict&quot; (2002) in which he criticized Speer for deliberate complicity in the crimes of the Nazi regime, which Speer had successfully concealed during the Nuremberg Trials.

Fest wrote his other major work on German history, &quot;Plotting Hitler&#x27;s Death: The German Resistance to Hitler&quot; (1994), to mark the 50th anniversary of the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler. This work marked a partial reconsideration of his earlier harsh verdict on the German people. He acknowledged that many Germans had opposed the Nazi regime within the limits imposed on them by their circumstances. He maintained his view, however, most Germans had willfully refused to accept the truth about Nazism until it was too late.

In 2002, Fest published &quot;Inside Hitler&#x27;s Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich&quot;, a work that was based in part on available evidence following the opening of the Soviet archives but largely confirmed the account of Hitler&#x27;s death given in Hugh Trevor-Roper&#x27;s book &quot;The Last Days of Hitler&quot; (1947). &quot;Inside Hitler&#x27;s Bunker&quot;, along with the memoirs of Hitler&#x27;s personal secretary Traudl Junge, provided the source material for the 2004 German film &quot;Der Untergang&quot; (&quot;Downfall&quot;), the third postwar German feature film to depict Hitler directly.

==Career in journalism and criticism==
After the Hitler biography, Fest became co-editor of the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, one of the leading German newspapers based in Frankfurt am Main and an institution in the German-speaking world. From 1973 to 1993, he edited the culture section of the paper. His views were generally conservative, pessimistic and sceptical, and he was particularly critical of the left-wing views that dominated German intellectual life from the late 1960s up to the collapse of communism in 1991. He took a leading role in the &quot;Historikerstreit&quot; (historians&#x27; dispute) of 1986–89, in which he was identified with those rejecting what they saw as the left-wing hegemony in German historiography in this period.

==Reception==
Fest&#x27;s biography of Hitler has been praised for its literary qualities and described as a milestone in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany. Others have criticized it as weakly researched and too dependent on dubious testimony by Albert Speer. Fest has been accused of helping Speer create legends about his role during the war. , a retired army German officer and military historian, has described Fest&#x27;s works as an example of a class of publications that influenced German public opinion that should in retrospect be considered very problematic (in a text about German anti-Nazi resistance).

==Personal life==
Joachim Fest was lastly married to Ingrid Ascher and had two sons from a previous marriage and a daughter; all his children followed him into publishing or the media. He died at his home in Kronberg im Taunus near Frankfurt am Main in 2006, the same year that his autobiography &quot;Not Me: Memoirs of a German Childhood&quot; was published. Fest took the main title from an incident in his childhood when, at the age of ten, he and his brother were summoned to their father&#x27;s study after he had been dismissed from his post as headmaster at a school. Fest&#x27;s father asked his sons to write down and remember a maxim from the Gospel of Matthew: &quot;Etiam si omnes – ego non&quot; (Even if all others [do] – not me).

<text>Constance Ann Cryer JP (&quot;née&quot; Place; born 14 December 1939) is a British former politician who was the Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Keighley from the 1997 general election up until she stood down at the 2010 general election.

==Early life==
Born Constance Ann Place in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, she comes from a political family. Her father, Allen Place, was an activist in the Independent Labour Party, as was his mother, Dinah Place, a suffragette. Ann Cryer was educated at St John&#x27;s Primary School in Darwen and Spring Bank Secondary Modern School in the same town, before attending the Bolton Institute of Technology.

She began her career as a clerk for Imperial Chemical Industries in 1955, moving to the General Post Office as a telephonist 1960 to 1964.

==Politics==
Cryer joined the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament when she was 18 and in 1961 became the youngest serving councillor in the country.

She was selected as the prospective Labour candidate for the Keighley constituency, the seat her husband had held, from an all-women shortlist. She was elected to the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, defeating the sitting Conservative MP Gary Waller by 7,132 votes. She made her maiden speech on 16 May 1997.

When she entered parliament in 1997 she was joined by her son John who had been elected for Hornchurch; they were the only mother and son partnership in the Commons at that time, although John Cryer was out of parliament during the 2005–10 parliament.

Cryer was re-elected in the 2001 and 2005 general elections. After the 2005 general election, she was a member of the Home Affairs Select committee. She voted against the government on many occasions and was a member of the left-wing Socialist Campaign Group during her time in parliament. Cryer voted with the government to increase detention without trial to 42 days for terror suspects. She favours nuclear disarmament.

Cryer attracted media attention, and death threats, for speaking out against forced marriages, honour killings, calling on immigrants to learn to speak English before entering the country, and for being amongst the first people to talk about the issue of gangs of Asian men sexually abusing children in Yorkshire.

On 21 August 2008, Cryer announced she would not contest the next general election, due to her health, energy levels and age.

In May 2012, Cryer unsuccessfully stood as a candidate for the Ilkley ward of City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council.

<text>The National Mobilization (, MOBILIZA) is a political party in Brazil founded by politicians from the state of Minas Gerais on April 21, 1984, advocating for agrarian reform, termination of debt payments, ending of relations with the International Monetary Fund and formation of a trade bloc with other South American nations.

Due to some problems with the Brazilian Electoral Court, the PMN&#x27;s registration was ceased in January 1989. The party restarted in June of the same year. At the legislative elections in Brazil, 6 October 2002, the party won one out of 513 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and no seats in the Senate.
From 2002 to 2010, the PMN was one of the members of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&#x27;s coalition.

At the 2010 elections, the PMN won four seats in the Chamber of Deputies and won the governorship of the state of Amazonas. In the Presidential race, the party supported the coalition of José Serra.

At the 2018 elections, the PMN won three seats, without endorsing any presidential candidates. Two of them later moved to the Liberal Party, leaving only one MP.

<doc id="415034" wikidata="Q208326" url="?curid=415034" title="Body Language (Kylie Minogue album)">
<text>Body Language is the ninth studio album by Australian singer Kylie Minogue. It was released on 10 November 2003 by Parlophone. Following the commercial success of her eighth studio album &quot;Fever&quot; (2001), Minogue enlisted a diverse group of writers and producers to aid in creating a new album, including Cathy Dennis, Dan Carey, Emiliana Torrini, Johnny Douglas, and Kurtis Mantronik among others. Influenced by the musical works of the 1980s and artists like Prince and Scritti Politti, &quot;Body Language&quot; musically differs from Minogue&#x27;s previous albums, which mainly featured disco-oriented dance-pop tracks, and instead explores genres like synth-pop, electroclash, R&amp;B, and hip hop. Lyrically, the album touches upon themes of flirtation, romance, introspection and heartbreak.

Following its release, &quot;Body Language&quot; received generally favorable reviews from music critics, many of whom complimented Minogue for experimenting with new genres and the overall production of the album. Some critics, however, opined that many songs lacked catchy material and were not suitable for dancing. Commercially, &quot;Body Language&quot; peaked at number two on the albums chart of Australia and was certified double-platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). In the United Kingdom, the album peaked at number six and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).

Three singles were released from &quot;Body Language&quot;. &quot;Slow&quot; was released as the lead single in November 2003 and was a commercial success, peaking at number one on the singles charts of Australia, Denmark, Spain and the United Kingdom. &quot;Red Blooded Woman&quot; was released as the second single and reached the top five in Australia and the United Kingdom. &quot;Chocolate&quot; was released as the final single and peaked inside the top 10 in the United Kingdom. Minogue performed at a one-off concert-show titled &quot;Money Can&#x27;t Buy&quot;, on 15 November 2003 to mark the release of the album. &quot;Body Language&quot; became notable for displaying another change in Minogue&#x27;s persona and is cited as an example of her numerous &quot;reinventions&quot;. The album sold 1.5 million copies worldwide. It was reissued for the album&#x27;s twentieth anniversary, on vinyl for the first time ever, on 8 March 2024.

== Background and development ==

In October 2001, Kylie Minogue released her eighth studio album &quot;Fever&quot;. The disco and Europop-influenced dance-pop album became an international commercial success, debuting at number one on the record charts of Minogue&#x27;s native Australia and the United Kingdom. It was Minogue&#x27;s first album to be released in the United States since her second studio album &quot;Enjoy Yourself&quot; (1989), and became her biggest commercial success in the region after peaking at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. With worldwide sales over six million copies, &quot;Fever&quot; became Minogue&#x27;s highest-selling album to date. The success of the album, particularly in the US, was credited to the commercial impact of its lead single &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;, which reached number one in 40 countries. &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; sold over five million copies worldwide, becoming Minogue&#x27;s highest selling single to date and also one of the best-selling singles of all time.

Soon, Minogue began work on her ninth studio album &quot;Body Language&quot;. Aiming to create a dance-pop album inspired by electronic music from the 1980s, Minogue enlisted collaborators such as Cathy Dennis, Dan Carey, Emiliana Torrini, Johnny Douglas and Mantronix. Talking further about Scritti Politti, a British post-punk band, Minogue reminisced about her collaboration with the band&#x27;s frontman Green Gartside, who provides vocals on the track &quot;Someday&quot;, saying, &quot;To this day I haven&#x27;t met him! I left a message on his answering machine, saying, &quot;Hi, it&#x27;s Kylie! I just wanted to say thanks so much! You sound brilliant!&quot; &quot;After Dark&quot; was co-written by Dennis, who had previously co-written &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; for Minogue. Torrini, who co-wrote &quot;Slow&quot;, revealed how she was approached for writing the song, saying &quot;It was like I had just accidentally walked into the line of fire with, &quot;Hey! You There! It was all quite surreal. I still think Kylie&#x27;s people were trying to call Jamelia, and they just got the wrong number. It&#x27;d be much more funny if that is how it actually happened&quot;. The recording of &quot;Body Language&quot; took place during the summer of 2003, in London, England; Dublin, Ireland and Marbella, Spain.

==Music and lyrics==

Inspired by music from the 1980s, &quot;Body Language&quot; deviates from Minogue&#x27;s usual disco-influenced dance-pop style, evident on albums like &quot;Light Years&quot; (2000) and &quot;Fever (2001),&quot; and instead explores genres like synthpop, electroclash, club and R&amp;B. In comparison to her previous work, &quot;Body Language&quot; is a &quot;slower-burning record&quot; and begins with the song &quot;Slow&quot;, a &quot;minimal&quot; and simple track which serves as a primary example of the synthpop-styled production of the album. Adrien Begrand from PopMatters compared it to &quot;More More More&quot;, the opening track of &quot;Fever&quot;, saying &quot;In contrast to the pulsating, hi-hat driven dance beat of &quot;Fever&quot;&#x27;s &quot;More More More&quot;, &quot;Body Language&quot; gets off to a more understated start&quot;. Other synthpop songs on the album include &quot;Still Standing&quot; and &quot;Promises&quot;, which make use of &quot;buzzing, low synth lines driving the beats, and chord flourishes that sound straight out of 1984&quot;. The former track also displays influences of nu-disco and club music.

Many songs on &quot;Body Language&quot; are influenced by R&amp;B and hip hop music, two genres Minogue newly experimented with on the album. &quot;Red Blooded Woman&quot; &quot;blends the 1980s sound with an almost garage-like beat&quot; and contains a &quot;Boy! Boy!&quot; hook and &quot;la la la&quot; bridge. Critics felt its production was similar to that by American hip hop and R&amp;B producer Timbaland. Elements of funk are also present and are notably clear on tracks like &quot;Sweet Music&quot; and &quot;I Feel for You&quot;. &quot;Secret (Take You Home)&quot; received considerable coverage as it features a &quot;coquettish&quot; rap section delivered by Minogue. &quot;Body Language&quot; also contains ballads such as the quiet storm-influenced &quot;Chocolate&quot; and &quot;Obsession&quot;. Minogue&#x27;s vocal delivery on the album is mostly seductive and breathy in tone, such as in songs like &quot;Slow&quot; and &quot;Chocolate&quot;, although the track &quot;Obsession&quot; features raspy vocals.
Critics noted references and similarities to 1980s pop music throughout the album. Adrien Begrand from PopMatters found the hook of &quot;Sweet Music&quot; similar to those in songs by Prince and INXS. &quot;Still Standing&quot; was described by Helen Pidd from &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;a magnificent blend of Prince&#x27;s &quot;Kiss&quot; and Peter Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;&quot;. &quot;Red Blooded Woman&quot; contains a reference to British band Dead or Alive&#x27;s 1985 song &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)&quot;, in the line &quot;You got me spinning round, round, round, round like a record&quot;. The title of &quot;I Feel for You&quot; is the same as the 1979/1984 song by Prince and Chaka Khan, although it is not a cover of the song. &quot;Secret (Take You Home)&quot; directly refers to urban contemporary band Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam&#x27;s 1984 song &quot;I Wonder If I Take You Home&quot;, both in its title and refrain. The line of the song in which Minogue sings &quot;don&#x27;t confuse emotions with the pleasure principle&quot; also refers to American recording artist Janet Jackson&#x27;s 1987 song &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot;.

Lyrically, &quot;Body Language&quot; touches upon themes like enjoyment, flirting, sex, and &quot;partying like it&#x27;s 1987 all over again&quot;. In an interview with VH1, Minogue was asked why the lyrics on the album &quot;sound more personal than they might have been a few years ago&quot;, and she responded by saying &quot;Some of that could be just chance! I wrote lyrics that were intensely personal to me on an album a few years ago. Maybe people know me better now, and therefore, if a songwriter pitches me a song, they might tailor it [to fit me]. I get the lyrics of a tune and interpret them my way&quot;. Although the lyrics of &quot;Slow&quot; seem like an invitation to the dance floor, Minogue revealed that &quot;it&#x27;s about how time and space have a different meaning when you meet someone [you really like]&quot;. In &quot;Sweet Music&quot;, Minogue sings about the &quot;magic of the modern singer/producer partnership&quot; in lines like &quot;I think we&#x27;re on to something/Your taste it mirrors mine/So hot and in the moment&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s make this demo right&quot;. The song also makes use of double entendre in some lines. Similarly, &quot;Chocolate&quot; is &quot;packed with saccharine innuendo&quot;. &quot;Secret (Take You Home)&quot; contains various metaphors that compare flirting and sex to car racing. Ballads like &quot;Obsession&quot; deal with issues of loss and the ending of a relationship.

== Release ==
&quot;Body Language&quot; was released on 14 November 2003 in Australia, while in the United Kingdom it was released three days later. In the United States, &quot;Body Language&quot; was released on 10 February 2004. The cover art of the album, as well as other promotion shoots, show Minogue striking a pose in a black and white striped crop top, which reveals her midriff, and black pantyhose, which were worn without shoes. Her appearance is similar to that of French actress and singer Brigitte Bardot. Minogue described the promotion shoots as &quot;the perfect mix of coquette, kitten and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;, and revealed that &quot;We shot it on location in the South of France, so it was [easy to] channel the spirit of [Brigitte] Bardot. She&#x27;s a great iconic reference, particularly that period where she was working with Serge Gainsbourg&quot;. The title of the album was taken from a line from the song &quot;Slow&quot; in which Minogue sings &quot;Read my body language&quot;.

=== Singles ===

&quot;Slow&quot; was released on 3 November 2003 as the lead single from &quot;Body Language&quot;. The song garnered critical acclaim, with Minogue&#x27;s breathy and seductive vocal delivery receiving particular praise. Commercially, the single was a success. It debuted at number one on both the Australian Singles Chart and UK Singles Chart. In the latter region, it became Minogue&#x27;s seventh number one single and made her a record-holding female artist for spending the longest duration as a UK chart topper. Elsewhere, it reached number one in Denmark, Spain, and on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Songs chart. In Australia, &quot;Slow&quot; was certified platinum by the ARIA for shipments of 70,000 units. The accompanying music video for &quot;Slow&quot; was directed by Baillie Walsh and was shot in Barcelona, Spain. It features Minogue and a number of beach models performing synchronised choreography to the song while sunbathing next to the Piscina Municipal de Montjuïc swimming pool.

&quot;Red Blooded Woman&quot; was released as the second single on 1 March 2004. Critics praised its radio-friendly sound and lyrical content. The song performed well on charts, peaking at numbers four and five in Australia and the United Kingdom, respectively. An accompanying music video for the song was directed in Los Angeles by Jake Nava, and features Minogue performing dance routines in various locations.

&quot;Chocolate&quot; was released as the third and final single on 28 June 2004. It received positive reviews from critics, some of whom praised its sensual nature and breathy vocals. The song was a moderate commercial success, peaking at number six in the United Kingdom, but narrowly missing the top 10 in Australia. It became Minogue&#x27;s 27th single to peak inside the top 10 in the UK. Dawn Shadforth, who had previously directed the video for &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;, collaborated on the music video for &quot;Chocolate&quot;, which sees Minogue and a number of backup dancers performing a ballet-like dance routines as a tribute to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musicals.

=== Promotion ===

A one-off concert show was held at entertainment venue Hammersmith Apollo, London, on 15 November 2003 to mark the release of &quot;Body Language&quot;. The show was entitled &quot;Money Can&#x27;t Buy&quot; as no tickets were publicly made available for sale and only fans with invitations were allowed to attend the concert. The 75-minute-long concert cost one million pounds to set up and display manufacturer Barco was hired to provide LED displays as backdrops to Minogue&#x27;s performances. The singer wore five different costumes during the show which were designed by fashion houses like Chanel, Balenciaga, and Helmut Lang. The concert was entitled &quot;Money Can&#x27;t Buy&quot; as no tickets were made available for purchase publicly; only competition winners and guests with invitations were allowed to attend the show. 4000 seats were made available for viewing the show and while most were reserved for invited guests, some tickets were auctioned at a charity ball for the &quot;Full Stop&quot; campaign by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).

The show was directed by Minogue&#x27;s stylist and friend William Baker, with musical arrangement and choreography being handled by Steve Anderson and Michael Rooney, respectively. The setlist of the concert show was composed primarily of songs from &quot;Body Language&quot;; other songs were taken from &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; (1997), &quot;Light Years&quot;, and &quot;Fever&quot;. The show was split in four acts: &quot;Paris by Night&quot;, &quot;Bardello&quot;, &quot;Electro&quot; and &quot;On Yer Bike&quot;. &quot;Still Standing&quot; and &quot;Red Blooded Woman&quot; were performed in the first act, &quot;After Dark&quot; and &quot;Chocolate&quot; in the second, &quot;Slow&quot; and &quot;Obsession&quot; in the third, and &quot;Secret (Take You Home)&quot; in the last. The performances were recorded for inclusion in the DVD recording of the event, which was released as &quot;Body Language Live&quot; on 12 July 2004. The DVD was certified platinum and gold in Australia and the United Kingdom, respectively.

== Critical reception ==
At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, &quot;Body Language&quot; received an average score of 62 based on 17 reviews which indicates &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;. Chris True from AllMusic complimented Minogue for expanding her &quot;horizons&quot; and felt that the album was consistent and worked as a &quot;piece&quot;, calling it &quot;stylish without being smarmy, retro without being ironic&quot;. He favoured the overall production of the album and praised Minogue for displaying a &quot;sense of class&quot;, which he felt was lacking in the work of female artists like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Madonna; he concluded by labelling &quot;Body Language&quot; a &quot;near perfect pop record&quot; and &quot;what may well be the best album of her [Minogue&#x27;s] career&quot;. Keith Caulfield from &quot;Billboard&quot; was also positive in his review and complimented Minogue for selecting a talented creative team, saying, &quot;The sexy, solid set is glued together by danceable beats and Minogue&#x27;s knack for picking great songs and producers.&quot; &quot;The Irish Times&quot; review of the song called the album a &quot;worthy successor to 2001&#x27;s smash hit &quot;Fever&quot;, a supremely danceable collection of electro-pop songs that&#x27;s clearly in thrall to the 80s&quot; and complimented Minogue&#x27;s versatile vocal delivery.

Ethan Brown from &quot;New York&quot; was greatly impressed by opening track &quot;Slow&quot;, and commented that most of the songs on the album &quot;mimic its sound, none of the other songs on Body Language comes close to the achievement of &quot;Slow&quot;&quot;. Sal Cinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; felt &quot;Body Language&quot; was a better album than &quot;Fever&quot;, calling it &quot;less immediate and more experimental, a midway point between the alternative/electronica of 1997&#x27;s &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; and Minogue&#x27;s more mainstream post-millennium work&quot;, and praised it for being cohesive. He also complimented Minogue&#x27;s &quot;willingness to try something new – even if it&#x27;s within the confines of dance-pop – is what&#x27;s made her an international sensation 15 years running&quot;. Rob Sheffield from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; favoured the sensual nature of the album, calling it &quot;fantastic&quot; and that &quot;At thirty-five, she&#x27;s ten times hotter than she was ten years ago – on &quot;Body Language&quot;, Kylie Minogue definitely sounds like she has a few more tricks stored on her hard drive than Britney [Spears] or Christina [Aguilera]&quot;.

Chris Willman from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called it Minogue&#x27;s &quot;Madonna-meets-Mirwais move&quot; and felt that her exploration of new genres is &quot;ludicrously enjoyable&quot;, although he opined that the album was &quot;synthetic&quot; and &quot;all &quot;Body&quot; [sic] no soul&quot;. Helen Pidd from &quot;The Guardian&quot; favoured the blend of 1980s musical styles on the album, but felt that it lacked danceable songs, saying &quot;Problem is, as with the majority of other tracks – including, most disappointingly, the Dennis-penned &quot;After Dark&quot; – you would be hard pushed to dance to it, which could well be &quot;Body Language&quot;&#x27;s downfall&quot;. John Robinson from &quot;NME&quot; gave &quot;Body Language&quot; an overall positive review and called it &quot;an extremely tastefully done, soulful modern r&#x27;n&#x27;b record&quot;, but felt that it &quot;fails to live up to its predecessor [&quot;Fever&quot;]&quot;. Likewise, Adrien Begnard from &quot;PopMatters&quot; felt that &quot;Body Language&quot; lacked the &quot;undeniably catchy&quot; material which was present in &quot;Fever&quot;, but praised the overall production and the first half of the album; he concluded that &quot;Even though &quot;Body Language&quot; is a bit of a misstep for Minogue, there&#x27;s a sense of class to it&quot; and that &quot;Britney [Spears] could learn a thing or two&quot;. The &quot;Spin&quot; review of the album commented that Minogue &quot;wears the &#x27;80s well&quot; and praised the dance-oriented songs on the track listing, although they criticised the ballads and pointed out that &quot;[at times] Minogue&#x27;s vocals are so over-processed that they barely seem to exist at all&quot;. On the other hand, Andy Battaglia from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; opined that the ballads &quot;work&quot; and concluded that &quot;&quot;Body Language&quot; shows Minogue as a surprisingly impressive presence in spurts, but she sounds better with her pleasure engine revving at full purr&quot;.

== Commercial performance ==
Although &quot;Body Language&quot; was not as much of a commercial success as &quot;Fever&quot;, it performed well nonetheless. In Minogue&#x27;s native Australia, &quot;Body Language&quot; entered and peaked at number two on the albums chart and spent a total of 18 weeks on the chart. The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) certified the album double-platinum for shipping 140,000 units in the country. In the United Kingdom, the album entered and peaked at number six on the UK Albums Chart with first week sales of 68,866 units. It remained inside the top 10 for one week, and for two weeks in the top 20. In total, it stayed on the chart for 30 weeks. &quot;Body Language&quot; was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 28 November 2003, and had sold 398,035 copies by December 2007.

Elsewhere, &quot;Body Language&quot; peaked at number 23 on the Austrian Albums Chart and was certified gold by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) for selling 7,500 units. In the Dutch-speaking Flanders region of Belgium, it peaked at number 10 on the Ultratop chart and spent a total of 17 weeks on the chart. It became Minogue&#x27;s first album to reach the top 10 in the region. &quot;Body Language&quot; entered and peaked at number eight on the Swiss Albums Chart, and spent a total of 17 weeks on the chart. In this region, the IFPI certified it gold for selling 20,000 units. In the United States, &quot;Body Language&quot; debuted at number 42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart with &quot;meager&quot; first-week sales of 43,000 units. According to Nielson SoundScan, &quot;Body Language&quot; had sold 177,000 units in the US as of March 2011. The album sold 1.5 million copies worldwide.

== Legacy ==

In 2004, Minogue was nominated for &quot;Best Female Artist&quot; at the 18th Annual Australian Recording Industry Association Music Awards and &quot;Body Language&quot; was nominated for &quot;Best Pop Release&quot;. At the 2004 Brit Awards, the singer received her third-consecutive nomination for &quot;Best International Female Solo Artist&quot;. At the 47th Grammy Awards ceremony held in the year 2005, lead single &quot;Slow&quot; was nominated for &quot;Best Dance Recording&quot;, and in 2012, Minogue picked the song as her all-time favourite song from her 25 years in music.

Following its release, &quot;Body Language&quot; was considered to be an example of Minogue&#x27;s constant &quot;reinventions&quot;. During this period, Minogue was often referred to as &quot;Bardot Kylie&quot; due to the Brigitte Bardot-inspired look she sported on the cover, and &quot;Body Language&quot; was seen as a step forward from the &quot;slick, minimalist and postmodern&quot; image she had adopted during the release of &quot;Fever&quot;. Chris True from AllMusic regarded the album as &quot;another successful attempt [by Minogue] at broadening her sound (with electro and hip-hop for instance) and winning more fans&quot;. Later in his review of Minogue&#x27;s tenth studio album &quot;X&quot; (2007), he remarked that &quot;By the time of 2004&#x27;s &quot;Body Language&quot;, Kylie Minogue was seemingly unassailable, with three hit albums, a number of hit singles, and a recharged career that only a few years before had seemed precarious at best&quot;.

In 2006, Larissa Dubecki from &quot;The Age&quot; commented that &quot;Kylie has beaten her early detractors by inhabiting almost a dozen identities, from the &quot;singing budgie&quot; who emerged from &quot;Neighbours&quot; to score her first hit single with a cover of the Little Eva classic &quot;Locomotion&quot; in 1987, to the 1960s ingenue of her most recent album, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Body Language&quot;&quot;. In 2020, Sal Cinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; ranked &quot;Body Language&quot; as the second best album of Minogue&#x27;s career. He praised the singer for exploring new genres and presenting a &quot;smooth, sleek, and understated&quot; album, which he described as an &quot;anomaly&quot; in Minogue&#x27;s discography. Mark Elliott from the website Dig! called it &quot;pleasingly experimental&quot;, noting that &quot;Body Language&quot; has come to be regarded as &quot;one of the most interesting and ultimately rewarding entries among the best Kylie Minogue albums&quot;. Similarly, writing for its twentieth anniversary, Quentin Harrison of Albumism opined that it is &quot;one of the subtlest and most creatively defiant vehicles within her canon&quot;.

<text>Yvette Cooper (born 20 March 1969) is a British politician who has served as Home Secretary since July 2024. A member of the Labour Party, Cooper has been member of parliament (MP) for Pontefract, Castleford and Knottingley, previously Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford, since 1997.

First elected to Parliament at the 1997 general election, Cooper was a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in three departments under Prime Minister Tony Blair from 1999 to 2005. She was promoted to Minister of State for Housing and Planning in 2005, and was retained in the role when Gordon Brown was appointed prime minister in 2007. In 2008, she joined Brown&#x27;s Cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, before being promoted to Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in 2009. Following Labour&#x27;s defeat at the 2010 general election, Cooper served in Ed Miliband&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Foreign Secretary from 2010 to 2011. In 2011, her husband Ed Balls was promoted to Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer; Cooper replaced Balls as shadow home secretary and served until Labour lost the 2015 general election.

On 13 May 2015, Cooper announced she would run to be Leader of the Labour Party in the leadership election following the resignation of Miliband. Cooper came third with 17.0% of the vote in the first round, losing to Jeremy Corbyn. Cooper subsequently resigned as shadow home secretary in September 2015. Cooper was the chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee from 2016 to 2021. As a backbencher, Cooper repeatedly sought to extend Article 50 to delay Brexit. She became shadow home secretary again in Starmer&#x27;s shadow cabinet in November 2021.
Following Labour&#x27;s victory in the 2024 general election, Cooper returned to government and was appointed home secretary by Prime Minister Keir Starmer in his ministry. She faced her first major domestic event, the riots across the country following the Southport stabbing, three weeks into her tenure.

==Early life and education==
Yvette Cooper was born on 20 March 1969 in Inverness, Scotland. Her father is Tony Cooper, former general secretary of the Prospect trade union, a former non-executive director of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and a former chairman of the British Nuclear Industry Forum. He was also a government adviser on the Energy Advisory Panel. Her mother, June, was a maths teacher.

She was educated at Eggar&#x27;s School, a comprehensive school in Holybourne, and Alton College, both in Alton, Hampshire. She read philosophy, politics and economics (PPE) at Balliol College, Oxford, and graduated with a first-class honours degree. She won a Kennedy Scholarship in 1991 to study at Harvard University, and completed her postgraduate studies with an MSc in economics at the London School of Economics.

==Early career==
Cooper began her career as an economic policy researcher for Shadow Chancellor John Smith in 1990 before working in Arkansas for Bill Clinton, nominee of the Democratic Party for President of the United States, in 1992. Later that year, she became a policy advisor to then Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Harriet Harman.

At the age of 24, Cooper developed chronic fatigue syndrome, from which she took a year to recover. In 1994 she moved to become a research associate at the Centre for Economic Performance. In 1995, she became the chief economics correspondent of &quot;The Independent&quot;, remaining with the newspaper until her election to the House of Commons in 1997.

==Parliamentary career==
Cooper was selected as the Labour candidate to contest Pontefract and Castleford at the 1997 general election. She was elected as MP for Pontefract and Castleford with 75.7% of the vote and a majority of 25,725. Cooper made her maiden speech in the Commons on 2 July 1997, speaking about her constituency&#x27;s struggle with unemployment. She served for two years on the Education and Employment Select Committee.

===Blair and Brown government: 1999–2010===
In 1999, she was promoted as Parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Department of Health. As a health minister, Cooper helped implement the Sure Start programme. In this post, she was also the first British government minister in history to take maternity leave.

At the 2001 general election, Cooper was re-elected as MP for Pontefract and Castleford with a decreased vote share of 69.7% and a decreased majority of 16,378.

In 2003, she became Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Regeneration in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister with the responsibility of coalfield regeneration. Following the 2005 general election she was promoted to Minister, as Minister of State for Housing and Planning based in the Department for Communities and Local Government from 2006.

Cooper was again re-elected at the 2005 general election with a decreased vote share of 63.7% and a decreased majority of 15,246.

After Gordon Brown became prime minister, Cooper was invited to attend cabinet meetings as Housing Minister. Shortly after taking the job, she was required to introduce the Home Information Pack (HIPs) scheme. According to Conservative columnist Matthew Parris, Cooper conceived HIPs, but avoided direct criticism for its problems because of her connection with Brown. In July 2007, Cooper announced in the House of Commons that &quot;unless we act now, by 2026 first-time buyers will find average house prices are ten times their salary. That could lead to real social inequality and injustice. Every part of the country needs more affordable homes – in the North and the South, in urban and rural communities&quot;.
In 2008, Cooper became the first woman to serve as Chief Secretary to the Treasury where she was involved with taking Northern Rock into public ownership. As her husband, Ed Balls, was already a cabinet minister, her promotion meant that the two became the first married couple ever to sit in the cabinet together.

In 2009, Cooper was appointed as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and took over leading on the Welfare Reform Act 2009 which included measures to extend the use of benefit sanctions to force unemployed people to seek work. Many campaigners – including the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) – urged Cooper to rethink Labour&#x27;s approach, arguing instead that increasing support for job seekers was vital to eradicating child poverty.

====Allegations over expenses====

In May 2009, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Cooper had changed the designation of her second home twice in two years. Following a referral to the parliamentary standards watchdog, Cooper and her husband Ed Balls were exonerated by John Lyon, the Standards Commissioner. He said they had paid capital gains tax on their homes and were not motivated by profit. Cooper and Balls bought a four-bedroom house in Stoke Newington, North London, and registered this as their second home (rather than their home in Castleford, West Yorkshire); this qualified them for up to £44,000 a year to subsidise a reported £438,000 mortgage under the Commons Additional Costs Allowance, of which they claimed £24,400. An investigation in MPs&#x27; expenses by Sir Thomas Legg found that Cooper and her husband had both received overpayments of £1,363 in relation to their mortgage. He ordered them to repay the money.

===Miliband Shadow Cabinet: 2010–2015===
Prior to the 2010 general election, Cooper&#x27;s constituency of Pontefract and Castleford was abolished, and replaced with Normanton, Pontefract, and Castleford. At the election, Cooper was elected as MP for Normanton, Pontefract, and Castleford with 48.1% of the vote and a majority of 10,979. Following Labour&#x27;s defeat at the general election, Cooper and her husband Ed Balls were both mentioned in the press as a potential leadership candidates when Gordon Brown resigned as Leader of the Labour Party.

Before Balls announced his candidacy, he offered to stand aside if Cooper wanted to stand, but Cooper declined for the sake of their children, stating that it would not be the right time for her. She later topped the 2010 ballot for places in the Shadow cabinet, and there was speculation that the newly elected Labour Leader Ed Miliband would appoint her Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer. She instead became Shadow Foreign Secretary.

When Alan Johnson resigned as Shadow Chancellor on 20 January 2011, Cooper was appointed Shadow Home Secretary. Her husband, Ed Balls, replaced Johnson as Shadow Chancellor. Cooper also served as Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities from October 2010 to October 2013.

====Shadow home secretary: 2011–2015====
On 20 January 2011, Cooper took the position of shadow home secretary amidst a shadow cabinet reshuffle. In this position, Cooper shadowed Theresa May at the Home Office. She labelled the government&#x27;s vans displaying posters urging illegal immigrants to go home a &quot;divisive gimmick&quot; in October 2013.

In February 2013, she was assessed as one of the 100 most powerful women in the United Kingdom by &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; on BBC Radio 4, although not in the top 20.

In 2013, she proposed the appointment of a national commissioner for domestic and sexual violence. She spoke at the Labour Party Conference in 2014 about eastern Europeans who were mistreated by employers of migrant labour.

Cooper was strongly critical of cuts to child tax credit announced by George Osborne in the July 2015 Budget; she authored the following statement in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;:
===2015 Labour leadership election===
At the 2015 general election, Cooper was re-elected as MP for Normanton, Pontefract, and Castleford with an increased vote share of 54.9% and an increased majority of 6.7%. Following the election and Ed Miliband&#x27;s resignation, she was nominated as one of four candidates for the Labour leadership. Cooper was nominated by 59 MPs, 12 MEPs, 109 CLPs, two affiliated trade unions and one socialist society. &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper endorsed Cooper as the &quot;best placed&quot; to offer a strong vision and unite the party while the &quot;New Statesman&quot;&#x27;s endorsement praised her experience. Former prime minister Gordon Brown publicly endorsed Cooper as his first choice for leader, as did former home secretary Alan Johnson.

During the campaign, Cooper supported reintroducing the 50p income tax rate and creating more high-skilled manufacturing jobs. She proposed the introduction of a living wage for social care workers and the construction of 300,000 houses every year. Cooper disagreed that Labour spent too much whilst in government.

=== Backbencher: 2015–2021===

Following the 2015 Labour Party leadership election, Cooper returned to the back benches, after nearly 17 years on the front bench. Building on her existing work on the European refugee crisis, Cooper was appointed chair of Labour&#x27;s refugee taskforce, working with local authorities, community groups and trade unions to develop a sustainable and humanitarian response to the crisis. She spoke about the issue at Labour&#x27;s annual conference in 2016.

She supported Owen Smith against Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 leadership election.

Following a vote of MPs on 19 October 2016, Cooper was elected chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, gaining more votes than fellow candidates, Caroline Flint, Chuka Umunna and Paul Flynn. As chair, Cooper launched a national inquiry into public views on immigration and, after an emergency inquiry into the Dubs scheme for child refugees, criticised the government&#x27;s decision to end the programme in February 2017.

At the snap 2017 general election, Cooper was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 59.5% and a decreased majority of 14,499.

Cooper was critical of the May government&#x27;s infrastructure plans&#x27; focus on big cities, and was formerly the chair of Labour Towns, a group of Labour MPs, councillors and mayors of towns seeking to promote investment in them – publishing a town manifesto in 2019.

She is a member of Labour Friends of Israel.

She was again re-elected at the 2019 general election, with a decreased vote share of 37.9% and a decreased majority of 1,276.

====Brexit====

During the Brexit process, Cooper consistently fought against a no-deal Brexit, tabling one of the main amendments in January 2019; others to table amendments were Caroline Spelman, Graham Brady, Rachel Reeves, Dominic Grieve and Ian Blackford.

In April, Cooper tabled a private members&#x27; bill, again with the intended effect of preventing a &quot;no-deal&quot; Brexit. The Bill was voted to be discussed as an important bill using processes often used for issues of national security. MPs voted 312 to 311 in favour of allowing her bill to be fast-tracked, and it was made law on 8 April 2019.

===Starmer Shadow Cabinet: 2021–2024===
Cooper was reappointed as shadow home secretary on 29 November 2021 by Keir Starmer, replacing Nick Thomas-Symonds in a shadow cabinet reshuffle.

Following allegations that Suella Braverman had breached the ministerial code by sending secure information with her private email, Cooper asked for possible security implications to be investigated. She wrote to Simon Case &quot;I am urging you and the Home Office to now urgently undertake such an investigation [into possible security breaches] as the public has a right to know that there are proper secure information procedures in place to cover the person who has been given charge of our national security.&quot; Cooper said that it raised doubts about the Prime Minister&#x27;s judgement. She also added that people need to be able to trust the home secretary with highly sensitive information and national security. Cooper said that the Conservative Party lacked ethics and adequate standards.

=== Home secretary: 2024–present ===
Due to the 2023 periodic review of Westminster constituencies, Cooper&#x27;s constituency of Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford was abolished, and replaced with Pontefract, Castleford and Knottingley. At the 2024 general election, Cooper was elected to Parliament as MP for Pontefract, Castleford and Knottingley with 47.5% of the vote and a majority of 6,630.

Following Labour&#x27;s victory in the general election, Cooper was appointed home secretary by Starmer in his government on 5 July. On 7 July, after Starmer confirmed that the Rwanda asylum plan had been scrapped, Cooper announced that the Border Security Command would be established in order to help reduce small boat crossings across the English channel.

Following the 2024 Southport stabbing, in which three young girls were killed, Cooper stated that she was concerned by the incident and described the emergency services&#x27; response as courageous. Cooper additionally visited Southport the following morning to lay flowers and meet officials and community leaders. Starmer also visited the same day and laid flowers at the scene, and was heckled by some members of the public. Cooper later condemned the riots across England and Northern Ireland following the stabbing. After Axel Rudakubana&#x27;s guilty plea on 20 January 2025, Cooper announced a public inquiry, stating that the victims&#x27; families &quot;needed answers about what had happened leading up to the attack&quot;. This was followed by Starmer&#x27;s promise to overhaul terrorism laws to reflect the type of non-ideological killings characterised by individuals like Rudakubana, stressing the threat from “acts of extreme violence perpetrated by loners, misfits, young men in their bedroom, accessing all manner of material online, desperate for notoriety, sometimes inspired by traditional terrorist groups, but fixated on that extreme violence, seemingly for its own sake”. Significant attention was drawn to the anti-radicalisation Prevent programme for failing to accept referrals of Rudakubana on the basis of him lacking a terrorist ideology. Although an emergency review found that Prevent had followed correct procedures on each referral, Cooper concluded “that too much weight was placed on the absence of ideology” in the programme. Cooper announced that there would be a review on the threshold at which Prevent intervenes, with senior lawyer David Anderson being assigned by Starmer as the Independent Prevent Commissioner to perform the review.

The new office of Border Security Commander was established, whose remit would be to lead the new command and its members. The command was launched by Cooper on 7 July 2024. The command would be funded by money previously earmarked for the Rwanda plan and would be responsible for coordinating the activities of Immigration Enforcement, MI5, the Border Force and the National Crime Agency in tackling smuggling gangs which facilitate illegal migrant crossings over the English Channel. A team in the Home Office was tasked with setting out the remit of the command, as well as its governance structure and its strategic direction. Martin Hewitt was appointed to the role of Border Security Commander in September 2024, by the Home Secretary.

In November 2024, Cooper voted in favour of the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, which proposes to legalise assisted suicide.

==Personal life==

Cooper married Ed Balls on 10 January 1998 in Eastbourne. Her husband was Economic Secretary to the Treasury in the Tony Blair government and Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families under Gordon Brown, then in opposition was Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer and a candidate in the 2010 Labour Party leadership election. The couple have two daughters and one son.

Cooper has published two books, entitled &quot;She Speaks: The Power of Women&#x27;s Voices&quot; and &quot;She Speaks: Women&#x27;s Speeches That Changed the World, from Pankhurst to Greta&quot;, released in November 2019 and October 2020, respectively.

<text>Jeremy Bernard Corbyn (; born 26 May 1949) is a British politician who has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Islington North since 1983. Now an independent, Corbyn had been a member of the Labour Party from 1965 until his expulsion in 2024, and remains a member of the Socialist Campaign Group parliamentary caucus. He served as Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Labour Party from 2015 to 2020. Corbyn identifies ideologically as a socialist on the political left.

Born in Chippenham, Wiltshire, Corbyn joined the Labour Party as a teenager. Moving to London, he became a trade union representative. In 1974, he was elected to Haringey Council and became Secretary of Hornsey Constituency Labour Party until elected as the MP for Islington North in 1983. His activism has included Anti-Fascist Action, the Anti-Apartheid Movement, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and advocating for a united Ireland and Palestinian statehood. As a backbencher, Corbyn routinely voted against the Labour whip, including New Labour governments. A vocal opponent of the Iraq War, he chaired the Stop the War Coalition from 2011 to 2015, and received the Gandhi International Peace Award and Seán MacBride Peace Prize. Following Ed Miliband&#x27;s resignation after the party had lost the 2015 general election, Corbyn won the 2015 party leadership election to succeed him. The Labour Party&#x27;s membership increased sharply, both during the leadership campaign and following his election.

Taking the party to the left, Corbyn advocated renationalising public utilities and railways, a less interventionist military policy, and reversals of austerity cuts to welfare and public services. Although he had sometimes been critical of the European Union (EU), he supported the Remain campaign in the 2016 EU membership referendum. After Labour MPs sought to remove him in 2016 through a leadership challenge, he won a second leadership contest against Owen Smith. Despite hostile treatment from the media, in the 2017 general election Corbyn led Labour to increase its vote share by 10 percentage points to 40 per cent, their largest rise since the 1945 general election. During his tenure as leader, Corbyn was criticised for the antisemitism within the party. He condemned antisemitism and apologised for its presence, while his leadership saw a strengthening of disciplinary procedures regarding hate speech and racism. In 2019, after deadlock in Parliament over Brexit, Corbyn endorsed holding a referendum on the withdrawal agreement, with a personal stance of neutrality. In the 2019 general election, Labour&#x27;s vote share fell to 32 per cent, leading to a loss of 60 seats, leaving it with 202, its fewest since the 1935 general election. Corbyn remained Labour leader for four months while the leadership election to replace him took place. His resignation as Labour leader formally took effect in April 2020 following the election of Keir Starmer, who led the party to victory at the next general election in 2024 with a vote share of 34 per cent.

After asserting that the scale of antisemitism had been overstated for political reasons, Corbyn was suspended from the party in 2020. In May 2024, after the 2024 general election had been called, Corbyn was not allowed to stand as a Labour candidate for his constituency, and subsequently announced he would stand as an independent candidate for Islington North; he was then expelled from Labour. He won re-election with a majority of 7,247.

==Early life==
Jeremy Bernard Corbyn was born on 26 May 1949 in Chippenham, Wiltshire, the son of mathematics teacher Naomi Loveday (née Josling; 1915–1987) and electrical engineer and power rectifier expert David Benjamin Corbyn (1915–1986). He has three elder brothers; one of them, Piers Corbyn (born 1947), is a weather forecaster who later became known as a climate change denier and anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist. For the first seven years of his life, the family lived in Kington St Michael, Wiltshire. His parents were Labour Party members and peace campaigners who met in the 1930s at a committee meeting in support of the Spanish Republic at Conway Hall during the Spanish Civil War.

When Corbyn was seven, the family moved to Pave Lane, Shropshire, where his father bought Yew Tree Manor, a 17th-century farmhouse which was once part of the Duke of Sutherland&#x27;s Lilleshall estate. Corbyn attended Castle House School, an independent preparatory school near Newport, Shropshire, before becoming a day student at Newport&#x27;s Adams Grammar School at the age of 11.

While still at school, Corbyn became active in the League Against Cruel Sports and the Labour Party Young Socialists within The Wrekin. He joined the Labour Party at the age of 16. He achieved two A-Levels at grade E, the lowest possible passing grade, before leaving school at 18. Corbyn joined the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in 1966 while at school and later became one of its three vice-chairs and subsequently vice-president. Around this time, he also campaigned against the Vietnam War.

After school, Corbyn worked briefly as a reporter for the local &quot;Newport and Market Drayton Advertiser&quot; newspaper. Around the age of 19, he spent two years doing Voluntary Service Overseas in Jamaica as a youth worker and geography teacher. He subsequently visited Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay throughout 1969 and 1970. While in Brazil, he participated in a student demonstration in São Paulo against the Brazilian military government. He also attended a May Day march in Santiago, where the atmosphere around Salvador Allende&#x27;s Popular Unity alliance which swept to power in the Chilean elections of 1970 made an impression on him: &quot;[I] noticed something very different from anything I had experienced... what Popular Unity and Allende had done was weld together the folk tradition, the song tradition, the artistic tradition and the intellectual tradition&quot;.

==Early career and political activities==
Returning to the UK in 1971, Corbyn worked as an official for the National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers. He began a course in Trade Union Studies at North London Polytechnic but left after a year without a degree after a series of arguments with his tutors over the curriculum. He worked as a trade union organiser for the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE) and Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, where his union was approached by Tony Benn and &quot;encouraged ... to produce a blueprint for workers&#x27; control of British Leyland&quot;; the plans did not proceed after Benn was moved to a different Department.

Corbyn was appointed a member of a district health authority and in early 1974, at the age of 24, he was elected to Haringey Council from South Hornsey ward. After boundary changes in 1978 he was re-elected in Harringay ward as councillor, remaining so until 1983. As a delegate from Hornsey to the Labour Party Conference in 1978, Corbyn successfully moved a motion calling for dentists to be employed by the National Health Service (NHS) rather than as private contractors. He also spoke in another debate, describing a motion calling for greater support for law and order as &quot;more appropriate to the National Front than to the Labour Party&quot;.

Corbyn became the local Labour Party&#x27;s agent and organiser, and had responsibility for the 1979 general election campaign in Hornsey.

Around this time, he became involved with the &quot;London Labour Briefing&quot;, where he was a contributor. Described by &quot;The Times&quot; in 1981 as &quot;&quot;Briefing&quot;″s founder&quot;, &quot;The Economist&quot; in a 1982 article named Corbyn as &quot;&quot;Briefing&quot;″s general secretary figure&quot;, as did a profile on Corbyn compiled by parliamentary biographer Andrew Roth in 2004, which states that he joined the editorial board as General Secretary in 1979. Michael Crick, in the 2016 edition of his book &quot;Militant&quot;, says that Corbyn was &quot;a member of the editorial board&quot;, as does Lansley, Goss and Wolmar&#x27;s 1989 work &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Municipal Left&quot;. Corbyn said in 2017 that these reports were inaccurate, telling Sophy Ridge: &quot;I read the magazine. I wrote for the magazine. I was not a member of the editorial board. I didn&#x27;t agree with it.&quot;

He worked on Tony Benn&#x27;s unsuccessful deputy leadership campaign in 1981. Corbyn was keen to allow former International Marxist Group member Tariq Ali to join the party, despite Labour&#x27;s National Executive having declared him unacceptable, and declared that &quot;so far as we are concerned ... he&#x27;s a member of the party and he&#x27;ll be issued with a card.&quot; In May 1982, when Corbyn was chairman of the Constituency Labour Party, Ali was given a party card signed by Corbyn; in November, the local party voted by 17 to 14 to insist on Ali&#x27;s membership &quot;up to and including the point of disbandment of the party&quot;.

In the July 1982 edition of &quot;Briefing&quot;, Corbyn opposed expulsions of the Trotskyist and entryist group Militant, saying that &quot;If expulsions are in order for Militant, they should apply to us too.&quot; In the same year, he was the &quot;provisional convener&quot; of &quot;Defeat the Witch-Hunt Campaign&quot;, based at Corbyn&#x27;s then address. The Metropolitan Police&#x27;s Special Branch monitored Corbyn for two decades, until the early 2000s, as he was &quot;deemed to be a subversive&quot;. According to the Labour Party, &quot;The Security Services kept files on many peace and Labour movement campaigners at the time, including anti-Apartheid activists and trade unionists&quot;.

==Parliamentary backbencher (1983–2015)==

===Labour in opposition (1982–1997)===
Corbyn was selected as the Labour Party candidate for the constituency of Islington North, in February 1982, winning the final ballot for selection by 39 votes against 35 for GLC councillor Paul Boateng, who in 1987 became one of the first three Black British Members of Parliament (MP). At the 1983 general election he was elected MP for the constituency, defeating the Independent Labour incumbent Michael O&#x27;Halloran, and immediately joined the socialist Campaign Group, later becoming secretary of the group.

Shortly after being elected to Parliament, he began writing a weekly column for the left-wing &quot;Morning Star&quot; newspaper. In May 2015, he said that &quot;the &quot;Star&quot; is the most precious and only voice we have in the daily media&quot;. In February 2017, the &quot;Morning Star&quot; said of Corbyn: &quot;He has been bullied, betrayed and ridiculed, and yet he carries on with the same grace and care he always shows to others – however objectionable their behaviour and treatment of him might be.&quot;

In 1983, Corbyn spoke on a &quot;no socialism without gay liberation&quot; platform and continued to campaign for LGBT rights.

He was a campaigner against apartheid in South Africa, serving on the National Executive of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, and was arrested in 1984 while demonstrating outside South Africa House, leading, decades later, to a viral image of Corbyn being arrested circulated by supporters on social media. This was as a member of the City of London Anti-Apartheid Group (CLAAG) who carried out a &quot;non-stop picket&quot; for 1,408 days to campaign for Nelson Mandela&#x27;s release from prison. The Anti-Apartheid Movement did not support this protest, as they had agreed not to demonstrate within 30 feet of the embassy, and the picket failed to gain support from the London ANC; Mandela&#x27;s failure to respond to CLAAG following his release from prison in 1990 is frequently described as a &#x27;snub&#x27;.

He supported the 1984–85 miners&#x27; strike. In 1985, he invited striking miners into the gallery of the House of Commons; they were expelled for shouting: &quot;Coal not dole&quot;. At the end of the strike Corbyn was given a medallion by the miners in recognition of his help.

In 1985, he was appointed national secretary of the newly launched Anti-Fascist Action.

During the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; in 1984, Conservative MP Terry Dicks said that so-called Labour &quot;scruffs&quot; (such as Corbyn, who at this time was known for wearing an old polo-necked sweater to the Commons) should be banned from addressing the House of Commons unless they maintained higher standards. Corbyn responded, saying that: &quot;It&#x27;s not a fashion parade, it&#x27;s not a gentleman&#x27;s club, it&#x27;s not a bankers&#x27; institute, it&#x27;s a place where the people are represented.&quot;

In 1990, Corbyn opposed the poll tax (formally known as the Community Charge) and nearly went to jail for not paying the tax. He appeared in court the following year as a result.

Corbyn supported the campaign to overturn the convictions of Jawad Botmeh and Samar Alami for the 1994 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in London which argued that there was insufficient evidence to tie them to the act, along with Amnesty International, Unison and a number of journalists and other MPs. Botmeh and Alami had admitted possessing explosives and guns but denied they were for use in Britain. The convictions were upheld by the High Court of Justice in 2001 and by the European Court of Human Rights in 2007.

Corbyn sat on the Social Security Select Committee from 1992 to 1997.

====Irish politics====
A longstanding supporter of a united Ireland, in the 1980s Corbyn met Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams a number of times. Corbyn consistently stated that he maintained links with Sinn Fein in order to work for a resolution to the armed conflict. According to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Corbyn was involved in over 72 events connected with Sinn Féin or other pro-republican groups during the period of the IRA&#x27;s paramilitary campaign.

Corbyn met Adams at the 1983 and 1989 Labour conferences (facilitated by pro-IRA Red Action) and in 1983 at Westminster, along with a number of other Labour MPs. In 1984, Corbyn and Ken Livingstone invited Adams, two convicted IRA volunteers and other members of Sinn Féin to Westminster. He was criticised by the Labour Party leadership for the meeting, which took place two weeks after the IRA&#x27;s bombing of the Conservative Party leadership that killed five people.

During the 1980s he campaigned on behalf of the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six, who were wrongly convicted of responsibility for IRA bombings in England in the mid-1970s. In 1986, Corbyn was arrested with 15 demonstrators protesting against what they saw as weak evidence and poor treatment during the trial of a group of IRA members including Patrick Magee, who was convicted of the Brighton hotel bombing and other attacks. After refusing police requests to move from outside the court, Corbyn and the other protesters were arrested for obstruction and held for five hours before being released on bail, but were not charged.

In 1987, Corbyn attended a commemoration by the Wolfe Tone Society in London for eight IRA members who were killed by Special Air Service soldiers while attacking a Royal Ulster Constabulary police station in Loughgall, County Armagh. At the commemoration, he told his fellow attendees that &quot;I&#x27;m happy to commemorate all those who died fighting for an independent Ireland&quot; and attacked the British government&#x27;s policies in Northern Ireland, calling for all British troops to be withdrawn from the region. Corbyn subsequently said that he had attended the event, which included a minute of silence for the eight IRA members, to &quot;call for a peace and dialogue process&quot;.

He voted against the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, saying &quot;We believe that the agreement strengthens rather than weakens the border between the six and the 26 counties, and those of us who wish to see a United Ireland oppose the agreement for that reason.&quot;

In the early 1990s, MI5 opened a file on Corbyn to monitor his links to the IRA.

In 1994, Corbyn signed a Commons motion condemning the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings, which killed 21 people.

A short time after IRA plans to bomb London were foiled in 1996, Corbyn invited Adams to the House of Commons for a press conference to promote Adams&#x27; autobiography, &quot;Before the Dawn&quot;. Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam and Labour leader Tony Blair condemned the invitation, with Mowlam arguing that it was detrimental to the peace process, and Blair threatening disciplinary action. Adams cancelled the event, to save further embarrassment to Corbyn and to avoid negative publicity.

In 1998, he voted for the Good Friday Agreement, saying he looked forward to &quot;peace, hope and reconciliation in Ireland in the future.&quot;

In 2017, Corbyn said that he had &quot;never met the IRA&quot;, although Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott later clarified that although he had met members of the IRA, &quot;he met with them in their capacity as activists in Sinn Fein&quot;.

===Labour in government (1997–2010)===

Between 1997 and 2010, during the New Labour governments, Corbyn was the Labour MP who voted most often against the party whip, including three-line whip votes. In 2005 he was identified as the second most rebellious Labour MP of all time during the New Labour governments. He was the most rebellious Labour MP in the 1997–2001 Parliament, the 2001–2005 Parliament and the 2005–2010 Parliament, defying the whip 428 times while Labour was in power. &quot;Jacobin&quot; described him as &quot;a figure who for decades challenged them [Labour Party elites] from the backbench as one of the most rebellious left-wing members of parliament&quot;.

Corbyn has called for Tony Blair to be investigated for alleged war crimes during the Iraq War. In July 2016, the Chilcot Report of the Iraq Inquiry was issued, criticising Blair for joining the United States in the war against Iraq. Subsequently, Corbyn – who had voted against military action against Iraq – gave a speech in Westminster commenting: &quot;I now apologise sincerely on behalf of my party for the disastrous decision to go to war in Iraq in March 2003&quot; which he called an &quot;act of military aggression launched on a false pretext&quot; something that has &quot;long been regarded as illegal by the overwhelming weight of international opinion&quot;. Corbyn specifically apologised to &quot;the people of Iraq&quot;; to the families of British soldiers who died in Iraq or returned injured; and to &quot;the millions of British citizens who feel our democracy was traduced and undermined by the way in which the decision to go to war was taken on.&quot;

Corbyn sat on the London Regional Select Committee from 2009 to 2010.

==== Stop the War Coalition and anti-war activism ====

In October 2001, Corbyn was elected to the steering committee of the Stop the War Coalition, which was formed to oppose the War in Afghanistan which started later that year. In 2002, Corbyn reported unrest : &quot;there is disquiet...about issues of foreign policy&quot; among some members of the Labour party. He cited &quot;the deployment of troops to Afghanistan and the threat of bombing Iraq&quot; as examples. He was vehemently opposed to Britain&#x27;s involvement in the Iraq War in 2003, and spoke at dozens of anti-war rallies in Britain and overseas. He spoke at the February anti-Iraq War protest which was said to be the largest such protest in British political history. At the same time, he expressed support for the Iraqi insurgency and the Palestinian intifada when he signed the second Cairo Declaration in December 2003, which said &quot;The Iraqis themselves are now engaged in a titanic struggle to rid their country of occupying forces. The Palestinian intifada continues under the most difficult circumstances. The US administration threatens Iran and other countries on a daily basis. Now is the time to draw together the forces of resistance in the Arab world and from around the globe.&quot;

In 2006, Corbyn was one of 12 Labour MPs to support Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party&#x27;s call for a parliamentary inquiry into the Iraq War. He was elected chair of the coalition in succession to Andrew Murray in September 2011, but resigned once he became Leader of the Labour Party in September 2015.

====Parliamentary groups and activism====
Corbyn is a member of a number of Parliamentary Trade Union Groups: he is sponsored by several trade unions, including UNISON, Unite and the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers. He is a supporter of the Unite Against Fascism pressure group. Corbyn was chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on the Chagos Islands, chair of the APPG on Mexico, Vice-Chair of the APPG on Latin America and vice-chair of the APPG on Human Rights. He has advocated for the rights of the forcibly removed Chagossians to return to the British Indian Ocean Territory.

Corbyn appeared on a call-in show on Press TV, an Iranian government television channel, several times between 2009 and 2012. He was criticised for appearing on the channel in light of Iran executing and imprisoning homosexuals, as well as Corbyn not questioning contributors who called the BBC &quot;Zionist liars&quot; and described Israel as a &quot;disease&quot;. Corbyn said in response that he used the programme to address &quot;human rights issues&quot; and that his appearance fee was &quot;not an enormous amount&quot; and was used to help meet constituency office costs. Corbyn&#x27;s final appearance was six months after the network was fined by Ofcom for its part in filming an interview with Maziar Bahari, an Iranian journalist, saying the interview had been held under duress and after torture.

===Labour in opposition (2010–2015)===
In the 2010 Labour Party leadership election, Corbyn supported Diane Abbott in the first round in which she was eliminated; thereafter, he supported Ed Miliband.

Corbyn was one of 16 signatories to an open letter to Ed Miliband in January 2015 calling for Labour to make a commitment to opposing further austerity, to take rail franchises back into public ownership, and to strengthen collective bargaining arrangements.

Corbyn sat on the Justice Select Committee from 2010 to 2015. Before becoming party leader Corbyn had been returned as member of Parliament for Islington North seven times, gaining 60.24% of the vote and a majority of 21,194 in the 2015 general election.

=== Leadership elections ===
Following the Labour Party&#x27;s defeat at the general election on 7 May 2015, Ed Miliband resigned as its party leader, triggering a leadership election. Corbyn decided to stand as a candidate, having been disillusioned by the lack of a left-wing voice, and said to his local newspaper, &quot;The Islington Tribune&quot;, that he would have a &quot;clear anti-austerity platform&quot;. He also said he would vote to scrap the Trident nuclear weapons system and would &quot;seek to withdraw from Nato&quot;. He suggested that Britain should establish a national investment bank to boost house-building and improve economic growth and lift wages in areas that had less investment in infrastructure. He would also aim to eliminate the current budget deficit over time and restore the 50p top rate of income tax. He added: &quot;This decision is in response to an overwhelming call by Labour Party members who want to see a broader range of candidates and a thorough debate about the future of the party. I am standing to give Labour Party members a voice in this debate&quot;. He indicated that, if he were elected, policies that he put forward would need to be approved by party members before being adopted and that he wanted to &quot;implement the democratic will of our party&quot;. The other candidates were Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham and Shadow Care Minister Liz Kendall. Several who nominated Corbyn later said they had ensured he had enough votes to stand, more to widen the political debate within the party than because of a desire or expectation that he would win.

At the Second Reading of the Welfare Reform and Work Bill in July 2015, Corbyn joined 47 Labour MPs to oppose the Bill, describing it as &quot;rotten and indefensible&quot;, whilst the other three leadership candidates abstained under direction from interim leader Harriet Harman. In August 2015, he called on Iain Duncan Smith to resign as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions after it was reported that thousands of disabled people had died after being found fit to work by Work Capability Assessments (instituted in 2008) between 2011 and 2014, although this was challenged by the government and by FullFact who said that the figure included those who had died and therefore their claim had ended, rather than being found fit for work.

Corbyn rapidly became the frontrunner among the candidates and was perceived to benefit from a large influx of new members. Hundreds of supporters turned out to hear him speak at the hustings across the nation and their enthusiastic reception and support for him was dubbed &quot;Corbynmania&quot; by the press. Membership numbers continued to climb after the start of his leadership. In addition, following a rule change under Miliband, members of the public who supported Labour&#x27;s aims and values could join the party as &quot;registered supporters&quot; for £3 and be entitled to vote in the election. There was speculation that the rule change would lead to Corbyn being elected by registered supporters without majority support from ordinary members. He was elected party leader in a landslide victory on 12 September 2015 with 59.5% of first-preference votes in the first round of voting. He would have won in the first round with 51% of votes, even without &quot;£3 registered supporters&quot;, having gained the support of 49.6% of full members and 57.6% of affiliated supporters. His 40.5% majority was a larger proportional majority than that attained by Tony Blair in 1994. His margin of victory was said to be &quot;the largest mandate ever won by a party leader&quot;.

An internal Labour Party report, entitled &quot;The work of the Labour Party&#x27;s Governance and Legal Unit in relation to antisemitism, 2014–2019&quot;, was leaked to the media in April 2020. The report stated that during the 2015 and 2016 leadership contests, staff members at Labour party headquarters looked for ways to exclude from voting members who they believed would vote for Corbyn. The staff members referred to this activity as &quot;trot busting&quot;, &quot;bashing trots&quot; and &quot;trot spotting&quot;.

==== Corbynmania ====

Corbyn was initially viewed as a token candidate for the left wing of the party and not expected to win. However, many new, young party members, who had joined after the membership fee had been reduced to £3, were attracted by what they saw as Corbyn&#x27;s authentic, informal style and radical policies. Hundreds of supporters turned out to hear him speak at the hustings across the nation and their enthusiastic reception and support for him was dubbed &quot;Corbynmania&quot; by the press.

Jonathan Dean characterised Corbynmania as a political fandom, comparable with the enthusiastic followings of popular media stars and other modern politicians such as Bernie Sanders and Justin Trudeau. Specific features included use of the #jezwecan hashtag, attendance at rallies and the posting of pictures such as selfies on social media. Artistic, merchandising and other activity consolidated and spread this fannish enthusiasm. This included a &quot;Jeremy Corbyn for Prime Minister&quot; (JC4PM) tour by celebrities such as Charlotte Church, Jeremy Hardy and Maxine Peake; a Corbyn superhero comic book; mash-ups and videos. Many of Corbyn&#x27;s supporters felt he possessed personal qualities such as earnestness and modesty leading them to develop a sense of emotional attachment to him as individual. These were seen as cultish by critics such as Margaret Beckett who said in 2016 that the Labour Party had been turned into the &quot;Jeremy Corbyn Fan Club&quot;.

A chant of &quot;Oh, Jeremy Corbyn&quot; was adopted as an anthem or chorus by his supporters. Sung in the style of a football chant to the tune of a riff from &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; by The White Stripes, it attracted special attention at the Glastonbury Festival 2017, where Corbyn appeared and spoke to the crowds. Labour&#x27;s weaker-than-expected performance in the 2018 local elections led to suggestions that Corbynmania had peaked.

==Leadership of the Labour Party (2015–2020)==
=== First term as Leader of the Opposition (2015–2017) ===

After being elected leader, Corbyn became Leader of the Official Opposition and shortly thereafter his appointment to the Privy Council was announced. In Corbyn&#x27;s first Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions session as leader, he broke with the traditional format by asking the Prime Minister six questions he had received from members of the public, the result of his invitation to Labour Party members to send suggestions, for which he received around 40,000 emails. Corbyn stressed his desire to reduce the &quot;theatrical&quot; nature of the House of Commons, and his début was described in a &quot;Guardian&quot; editorial as &quot;a good start&quot; and a &quot;long overdue&quot; change to the tone of PMQs. He delivered his first Labour Party Conference address as leader on 29 September 2015. Party membership nearly doubled between the May 2015 election and October 2015, attributed largely to the election as leader of Corbyn.

In September 2015 an unnamed senior serving general in the British Army stated that a mutiny by the Army could occur if a future Corbyn government moved to scrap Trident, pull out of Nato or reduce the size of the armed forces. The general said &quot;the Army just wouldn&#x27;t stand for it. The general staff would not allow a prime minister to jeopardise the security of this country and I think people would use whatever means possible, fair or foul to prevent that. You can&#x27;t put a maverick in charge of a country&#x27;s security&quot;.

In July 2016, a study and analysis by academics from the London School of Economics of national newspaper articles about Corbyn in the first months of his leadership of Labour showed that 75% of them either distorted or failed to represent his actual views on subjects.

=== 2017 general election ===

The Labour campaign in the 2017 general election focused on social issues such as health care, education and ending austerity. Corbyn&#x27;s election campaign was run under the slogan &quot;For the Many, Not the Few&quot; and featured rallies with a large audience and connected with a grassroots following for the party, including appearing on stage in front of a crowd of 20,000 at the Wirral Live Festival in Prenton Park.

Although Labour started the campaign as far as 20 points behind, and again finished as the second largest party in parliament, it increased its share of the popular vote to 40%, resulting in a net gain of 30 seats and a hung parliament. This was its greatest vote share since 2001. It was the first time Labour had made a net gain of seats since 1997, and the party&#x27;s 9.6% increase in vote share was its largest in a single general election since 1945. This was partly attributed to the popularity of its 2017 Manifesto that promised to scrap tuition fees, address public sector pay, make housing more affordable, end austerity, nationalise the railways and provide school students with free lunches.

=== 2019 general election and resignation ===
In May 2019, Theresa May announced her resignation and stood down as prime minister in July, following the election of her replacement, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Corbyn said that Labour was ready to fight an election against Johnson.

The 2019 Labour Party Manifesto included policies to increase funding for health, negotiate a Brexit deal and hold a referendum giving a choice between the deal and remain, raise the minimum wage, stop the pension age increase, nationalise key industries, and replace universal credit. Due to the plans to nationalise the &quot;big six&quot; energy firms, the National Grid, the water industry, Royal Mail, the railways and the broadband arm of BT, the 2019 manifesto was widely considered as the most radical in several decades, more closely resembling Labour&#x27;s politics of the 1970s than subsequent decades.

During the campaign for the upcoming general elections, Corbyn was accused by the Hindu Council UK of promoting anti-Hindu sentiments following his disparaging comments on the caste system &amp; his condemnation of the Hindu-right wing Bharatiya Janata Party led Indian government&#x27;s revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. Many Hindus living in the UK saw Corbyn&#x27;s attitude towards Hindus to be heavily influenced by Pakistani Muslim leaders of his party, with whom he shared a common pro-Palestinian stance.

The 2019 general election was the worst defeat in seats for Labour since 1935, with Labour winning just 202 out of 650 seats, their fourth successive election defeat. At 32.2%, Labour&#x27;s share of the vote was down around eight points on the 2017 general election and is lower than that achieved by Neil Kinnock in 1992, although it was higher than in 2010 and 2015. In the aftermath, opinions differed to why the Labour Party was defeated to the extent it was. The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell largely blamed Brexit and the media representation of the party. Tony Blair argued that the party&#x27;s unclear position on Brexit and the economic policy pursued by the Corbyn leadership were to blame.

Following the Labour Party&#x27;s unsuccessful performance in the 2019 general election, Corbyn conceded defeat and stated that he intended to step down as leader following the election of a successor and that he would not lead the party into the next election. Corbyn himself was re-elected for Islington North with 64.3% of the vote share and a majority of 26,188 votes over the runner-up candidate representing the Liberal Democrats, with Labour&#x27;s share of the vote falling by 8.7%. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the results as a &quot;realignment&quot; of UK politics as the Conservative landslide took many traditionally Labour seats in England and Wales. Corbyn insisted that he had &quot;pride in the manifesto&quot; that Labour put forward and blamed the defeat on Brexit. According to polling by the Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft, Corbyn was himself a major contribution to the party&#x27;s defeat. Corbyn remained Labour leader for four months while the leadership election to replace him took place. His resignation as Labour leader formally took effect in April 2020 following the election of Keir Starmer.

== Post-leadership ==
=== EHRC report and suspension ===

Allegations of antisemitism within the party grew during Corbyn&#x27;s leadership. Incidents involving Naz Shah in 2014 and Ken Livingstone in 2016 resulted in their suspension from party membership pending investigation. In response, Corbyn established the Chakrabarti Inquiry, which concluded that while the party was not &quot;overrun by anti-Semitism or other forms of racism&quot;, there was an &quot;occasionally toxic atmosphere&quot; and &quot;clear evidence of ignorant attitudes&quot;.

In 2017, Labour Party rules were amended to categorize hate speech, including antisemitism, as a disciplinary matter. In 2018, Corbyn faced scrutiny for his response in 2012 to an allegedly antisemitic mural and for his association with Facebook groups, mainly pro-Palestinian, containing antisemitic posts. Labour&#x27;s National Executive Committee (NEC) adopted a definition of antisemitism, for disciplinary purposes, in July of that year, aligning with the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) Working Definition, with modified examples related to criticism of Israel. In September 2018, the NEC incorporated all 11 IHRA examples, unamended, into the party&#x27;s code of conduct. In May 2019, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) launched an inquiry into whether Labour had &quot;unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish&quot;. After asserting that the scale of antisemitism had been overstated for political reasons, Corbyn was suspended from the party in 2020.

The Forde Report, written by lawyer Martin Forde in response to the dossier that was leaked in April 2020 (&quot;The work of the Labour Party&#x27;s Governance and Legal Unit in relation to antisemitism, 2014–2019&quot;), was released on 19 July 2022, stating that: &quot;[R]ather than confront the paramount need to deal with the profoundly serious issue of anti-Semitism in the party, both factions treated it as a factional weapon.&quot; It also described senior Labour staff as having displayed &quot;deplorably factional and insensitive, and at times discriminatory, attitudes&quot; towards Corbyn and his supporters, and detailed concerns by some staff about a &quot;hierarchy of racism&quot; in the party which ignored Black people. The report also expressed regret that Corbyn himself did not engage with the authors&#x27; request to interview him.

Responding to this, Corbyn&#x27;s former advisor Andrew Fisher wrote: &quot;Forde confirms that reflection is necessary. Cultural change requires painstaking work, not glib assertions of change.&quot; Corbyn himself stated that report &quot;calls into question the behaviour of senior officials in the party, in particular during the 2017 election&quot; and that &quot;wrongs must be righted&quot;.

===Peace and Justice Project===
On 13 December 2020, Corbyn announced the Project for Peace and Justice. Corbyn launched the project on 17 January 2021, and its affiliates include Christine Blower, Len McCluskey and Zarah Sultana. Rafael Correa said that he &quot;welcome[d] the creation&quot; of the project.

===Stop the War Coalition statement on Ukraine crisis===

On 18 February 2022, in the week before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Corbyn alongside 11 Labour MPs cosigned a statement from the Stop the War Coalition opposing any war in Ukraine. The statement said that &quot;the crisis should be settled on a basis which recognises the right of the Ukrainian people to self-determination and addresses Russia&#x27;s security concerns&quot;, that NATO &quot;should call a halt to its eastward expansion&quot;, and that the British government&#x27;s sending of arms to Ukraine and troops to eastern Europe served &quot;no purpose other than inflaming tensions and indicating disdain for Russian concerns&quot;. The statement&#x27;s authors also said that they &quot;refute [sic] the idea that NATO is a defensive alliance&quot;.

On the evening of 24 February, the first day of the invasion, Labour chief whip Alan Campbell wrote to all 11 Labour MPs who had signed the statement, requesting that they withdraw their signatures. All 11 agreed to do so the same evening. Corbyn and fellow former Labour independent MP Claudia Webbe did not withdraw their signatures from the statement, though David Lammy urged Corbyn to do so.

===Expulsion from the Labour Party and 2024 general election===
Media speculation that Corbyn would contest the 2024 general election as an Independent was reported in October 2023. Despite &quot;unanimous support&quot; from his Constituency Labour Party (CLP), Corbyn was not permitted to stand as a Labour parliamentary candidate. After announcing on 24 May 2024 that he would stand as an independent parliamentary candidate for Islington North, he was fully expelled from the Labour Party. He was endorsed by Mick Lynch of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers.

Corbyn responded to Keir Starmer&#x27;s claim of knowing the party would lose the 2019 election by saying &quot;Well, he never said that to me, at any time. And so I just think rewriting history is no help. It shows double standards, shall we say, that he now says he always thought that but he never said it at the time or anything about it. He was part of the campaign. He and I spoke together at events and I find it actually quite sad.&quot;

Leading members of the Islington North CLP resigned in order to support Corbyn, while also criticising the manner in which Nargund was selected as Islington North&#x27;s candidate. Corbyn was comfortably re-elected as an independent, even as Labour won a landslide victory in the general election. His majority over Nargund was over 7,000.

==Policies and views==
Corbyn self-identifies as a socialist. He has also been referred to as a &quot;mainstream [Scandinavian] social democrat&quot;. He advocates reversing austerity cuts to public services and some welfare funding made since 2010, as well as renationalisation of public utilities and the railways. A longstanding anti-war and anti-nuclear activist, he supports a foreign policy of military non-interventionism and unilateral nuclear disarmament, and has been a prominent activist for Palestinian solidarity throughout the Gaza–Israel conflict. Writer Ronan Bennett, who formerly worked as a research assistant to Corbyn, has described him as &quot;a kind of vegan, pacifist idealist, one with a clear understanding of politics and history, and a commitment to the underdog&quot;.

In 1997, the political scientists David Butler and Dennis Kavanagh described Corbyn&#x27;s political stance as &quot;far-left&quot;. Corbyn has described Karl Marx as a &quot;great economist&quot; and said he has read some of the works of Adam Smith, Marx and David Ricardo and has &quot;looked at many, many others&quot;. However, some have argued that Corbyn is less radical than previously described: for example, the journalist George Eaton has called him &quot;Keynesian&quot;. In 2023, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that most of the tax policies in Corbyn&#x27;s 2019 general election manifesto had been implemented by the winning Conservative government, including a higher corporation tax, a windfall tax on oil companies, a reduction in annual tax allowances on dividend income, raising income tax on high earners, and introducing a digital services tax on online retailers.

Corbyn named John Smith as the former Labour leader whom he most admired, describing him as &quot;a decent, nice, inclusive leader&quot;. He also said he was &quot;very close and very good friends&quot; with Michael Foot.

==Media coverage==
Analyses of domestic media coverage of Corbyn have found it to be critical or antagonistic. In July 2016, academics from the London School of Economics published a study of 812 articles about Corbyn taken from eight national newspapers around the time of his Labour leadership election. The study found that 75 percent of the articles either distorted or failed to represent his actual views on subjects. The study&#x27;s director commented that &quot;Our analysis shows that Corbyn was thoroughly delegitimised as a political actor from the moment he became a prominent candidate and even more so after he was elected as party leader&quot;.

Another report by the Media Reform Coalition and Birkbeck College in July 2016, based on 10 days of coverage around the time of multiple shadow cabinet resignations, found &quot;marked and persistent imbalance&quot; in favour of sources critical to him; the &quot;International Business Times&quot; was the only outlet that gave him more favourable than critical coverage.

In August 2016, a YouGov survey found that 97% of Corbyn supporters agreed that the &quot;mainstream media as a whole has been deliberately biasing coverage to portray Jeremy Corbyn in a negative manner&quot;, as did 51% of the general &quot;Labour selectorate&quot; sample.

In May 2017, Loughborough University&#x27;s Centre for Research in Communication and Culture concluded that the media was attacking Corbyn far more than May during nine election campaign weekdays examined. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Daily Express&quot; praised Theresa May for election pledges that were condemned when proposed by Labour in previous elections.

In February 2018, Momentum reported that attacks on Corbyn in the press were associated with increases in their membership applications. In September 2019, Labour leaders argued that traditional mainstream media outlets showed bias.

In December 2019, a study by Loughborough University found that British press coverage was twice as hostile to Labour and half as critical of the Conservatives during the 2019 general election campaign as it had been during the 2017 campaign.

In an interview with &quot;Middle East Eye&quot; in June 2020, Corbyn described the media&#x27;s treatment of himself while he was Labour leader as obsessive and &quot;at one level laughable, but all designed to be undermining&quot;. He said that the media coverage had diverted his media team from helping him pursue &quot;a political agenda on homelessness, on poverty in Britain, on housing, on international issues&quot; to &quot;rebutting these crazy stories, abusive stories, about me the whole time&quot;. He said he considered suing as a result of media treatment but was guided by advice from Tony Benn, who told him, &quot;Libel is a rich man&#x27;s game, and you&#x27;re not a rich man [...] Go to a libel case – even if you win the case, you&#x27;ll be destroyed financially in doing so&quot;.

==Personal life==

Corbyn lives in the Finsbury Park area of London. He has been married three times and divorced twice, and has three sons with his second wife. In 1974, he married his first wife, Jane Chapman, a fellow Labour Councillor for Haringey and now a professor at the University of Lincoln. They divorced in 1979. In the late 1970s, Corbyn had a brief relationship with Labour MP Diane Abbott.

In 1987, Corbyn married Chilean exile Claudia Bracchitta, granddaughter of Ricardo Bracchitta (Consul-General of Spain in Santiago), with whom he has three sons. He missed his youngest son&#x27;s birth as he was lecturing National Union of Public Employees members at the same hospital. Following a difference of opinion about sending their son to a grammar school (Corbyn opposes selective education), they divorced in 1999 after two years of separation, although Corbyn said in June 2015 that he continues to &quot;get on very well&quot; with her. His son subsequently attended Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s School, which had been his wife&#x27;s first choice. Their second son, Sebastian, worked on his leadership campaign and was later employed as John McDonnell&#x27;s Chief of Staff.

Corbyn&#x27;s second-eldest brother, Andrew, who was a geologist, died of a brain haemorrhage while in Papua New Guinea in 2001. Corbyn escorted the body from Papua New Guinea to Australia, where his brother&#x27;s widow and children lived.

In 2012, Corbyn went to Mexico to marry his Mexican partner Laura Álvarez, who runs a fair trade coffee import business that has been the subject of some controversy. A former human rights lawyer in Mexico, she first met Corbyn shortly after his divorce from Bracchitta, having come to London to support her sister Marcela following the abduction of her niece to America by her sister&#x27;s estranged husband. They contacted fellow Labour MP Tony Benn for assistance, who introduced them to Corbyn, who met with the police on their behalf and spoke at fundraisers until the girl was located in 2003. Álvarez then returned to Mexico, with the couple maintaining a long-distance relationship until she moved to London in 2011. Álvarez has described Corbyn as &quot;not very good at house work but he is a good politician&quot;. They had a cat called El Gato (&quot;The Cat&quot; in Spanish). Corbyn had previously owned a dog called Mango, described by &quot;The Observer&quot; in 1984 as his &quot;only constant companion&quot; at the time.

===Personal beliefs and interests===
When interviewed by &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; in December 2015, Corbyn refused to reveal his religious beliefs and called them a &quot;private thing&quot;, but denied that he was an atheist. He has said that he is &quot;sceptical&quot; of having a god in his life. He compared his concerns about the environment to a sort of &quot;spiritualism&quot;. Corbyn has described himself as frugal, telling Simon Hattenstone of &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;I don&#x27;t spend a lot of money, I lead a very normal life, I ride a bicycle and I don&#x27;t have a car.&quot; He has been a vegetarian for nearly 50 years, after having volunteered on a pig farm in Jamaica when he was 19, and stated in April 2018 that he was considering becoming a vegan. Although he has been described in the media as teetotal, he said in an interview with the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; that he does drink alcohol but &quot;very, very little&quot;.

Corbyn is a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Cycling. He enjoys reading and writing, and speaks fluent Spanish. He supports Arsenal F.C., which is based in his constituency, and has signed parliamentary motions praising the successes of its men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams. In 2015 Corbyn supported a campaign for the club to pay its staff the London Living Wage. Corbyn is an avid &quot;drain spotter&quot; and has photographed decorative drain and manhole covers throughout the country.

Corbyn co-edited with Len McCluskey the anthology &quot;Poetry for the Many&quot;, published in November 2023 by OR Books.

===Interview under police caution===

On 19 January 2025, Corbyn, alongside former Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer John McDonnell, agreed to be interviewed under caution by police following a pro-Palestinian rally in central London. The Metropolitan Police said they witnessed a &quot;deliberate effort, including by protest organisers&quot; to breach conditions that had been imposed on the event. However, it is unclear as to the specific reasons as to why Corbyn was invited to an interview.

== Awards and recognition ==
In 2013, Corbyn was awarded the Gandhi International Peace Award for his &quot;consistent efforts over a 30-year parliamentary career to uphold the Gandhian values of social justice and non‐violence&quot;. In the same year, he was honoured by the Grassroot Diplomat Initiative for his &quot;ongoing support for a number of non-government organisations and civil causes&quot;. Corbyn has won the Parliamentary &quot;Beard of the Year Award&quot; a record six times, as well as being named as the Beard Liberation Front&#x27;s &quot;Beard of the Year&quot;, having previously described his beard as &quot;a form of dissent&quot; against New Labour.

In 2016, Corbyn was the subject of a musical entitled &quot;Corbyn the Musical: The Motorcycle Diaries&quot;, written by journalists Rupert Myers and Bobby Friedman.

In 2017 the American magazine &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; named Corbyn in its Top 100 Global Thinkers list for that year &quot;for inspiring a new generation to re-engage in politics&quot;. In December 2017 he was one of three recipients awarded the Seán MacBride Peace Prize &quot;for his sustained and powerful political work for disarmament and peace&quot;. The award was announced the previous September.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media is an honor presented to a composer (or composers) for an original score created for a film, TV show or series, or other visual media at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by The Recording Academy of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

It has been awarded since the 2nd Annual Grammy Awards in 1959. The first recipient was American composer and pianist Duke Ellington, for the soundtrack to the 1959 film &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot;. Originally known as the Grammy Award for Best Sound Track Album – Background Score from a Motion Picture or Television, the award is currently (2025) known as the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media (Includes Film and Television. Until 2001, the award was presented to the composer of the music alone. From 2001 to 2007, the music producer(s) and sound engineer/mixer(s) shared the award. In 2007, the award reverted to a composer-only award. John Williams holds the record for most wins and nominations for the award, with eleven wins out of thirty-four nominations. Austin Wintory&#x27;s nomination for &quot;Journey&quot; at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards was the only time that a video game was nominated in this category before the new category of [[Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media]] was created in 2022.

<doc id="415045" wikidata="Q373895" url="?curid=415045" title="Betty White">
<text>Betty Marion Ludden ( White; January 17, 1922December 31, 2021) was an American actress and comedian. A pioneer of early television with a career spanning almost seven decades, she was noted for her vast number of television appearances, acting in sitcoms, sketch comedy, and game shows. 

White produced and starred in the series &quot;Life with Elizabeth&quot; (19531955), thus becoming the first woman to produce a sitcom. After moving from radio to television, she became a staple panelist of American game shows such as &quot;Password&quot;, &quot;Match Game&quot;, &quot;Tattletales&quot;, &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot;, and &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot;. Dubbed &quot;the first lady of game shows&quot;, she became the first woman to receive the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host for the show &quot;Just Men!&quot; in 1983. She then became more widely known for her guest and recurring appearances on shows such as &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;, &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Boston Legal&quot;.

White&#x27;s biggest roles include Sue Ann Nivens on the CBS sitcom &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; (1973–1977), Rose Nylund on the NBC sitcom &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; (1985–1992), and Elka Ostrovsky on the TV Land sitcom &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; (2010–2015). She had a late career resurgence when she starred in the romantic comedy film &quot;The Proposal&quot; (2009) and hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; the following year, garnering her a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. The 2018 documentary &quot;Betty White: First Lady of Television&quot; detailed her life and career.

For her lengthy work in radio, television, and film, White twice earned the Guinness World Record for the longest TV career by a female entertainer in both 2014 and 2018. She received various awards and nominations, including seven Emmy Awards, three Screen Actors Guild Awards, and a Grammy Award. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1995.

==Early life==
Betty Marion White was born in Oak Park, Illinois, on January 17, 1922. She later clarified that &quot;Betty&quot; was her legal name and not a shortened version of &quot;Elizabeth&quot; as some people had assumed. She was the only child of housewife Christine Tess (née Cachikis) and lighting company executive Horace Logan White. Her father was from Michigan. White&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Greek, her paternal grandfather was Danish, both of her grandmothers were Canadians of English descent, and her other ancestry included Welsh. When she was one year old, her family moved to Alhambra, California, and later to Los Angeles during the Great Depression. To make extra money, her father built crystal radios and sold them wherever he could. Since it was the height of the Depression and hardly anyone had a sizable income, he would trade the radios for other goods, which sometimes included dogs.

White was educated in Beverly Hills, where she attended Horace Mann Elementary School and Beverly Hills High School, graduating from the latter in 1939. Her interest in wildlife was sparked by family vacations to the Sierra Nevada. She initially aspired to become a forest ranger, but was unable to do so because women were not allowed to serve as rangers at the time. She instead pursued an interest in writing; she wrote and played the lead in a graduation play at Horace Mann School and discovered her interest in performing. Inspired by her idols Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, she decided to pursue a career as an actress.

One month after White graduated from high school, she and a classmate sang songs from &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; on an experimental television show, at a time when the medium of television itself was still in development. She found work as a model, and her first professional acting job was at the Bliss Hayden Little Theatre. After the U.S. entered World War II in 1941, she volunteered for the American Women&#x27;s Voluntary Services. Her assignment included driving a PX truck with military supplies to the Hollywood Hills. She also participated in events for troops before they were deployed overseas. Commenting on her wartime service, she later said that it was &quot;a strange time and out of balance with everything&quot;.

== Career ==
=== 1951–1969: Early career and breakthrough ===

After the war, White made the rounds to movie studios looking for work, but was turned down because she was &quot;not photogenic&quot;. She started to look for radio jobs, where being photogenic did not matter. Her first radio jobs included reading commercials and playing bit parts, and sometimes even doing crowd noises. She made about five dollars a show. She would do just about anything, like singing on a show for no pay. She appeared on shows such as &quot;Blondie&quot;, &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot;, and &quot;This Is Your FBI&quot;. She was then offered her own radio show, called &quot;The Betty White Show&quot;.
In 1949, she began appearing as co-host with Al Jarvis on his daily live television variety show &quot;Hollywood on Television&quot;, originally called &quot;Make Believe Ballroom&quot;, on KFWB and then on KLAC-TV (now KCOP-TV) in Los Angeles.

White began hosting the show by herself in 1952 after Jarvis&#x27;s departure, spanning five and a half hours of live ad lib television six days per week, over a continuous four-year span. In all of her various variety series over the years, White would sing at least a couple of songs during each broadcast. In 1951, she was nominated for her first Emmy Award as &quot;Best Actress&quot; on television, competing with Judith Anderson, Helen Hayes, and Imogene Coca; the award went to Gertrude Berg. At this point, the award was for body of work, with no shows named in nominations.

==== &quot;The Betty White Show&quot; (1952–1954) ====
From 1952 to 1954, White hosted and produced her own daily talk/variety show, &quot;The Betty White Show&quot;, first on KLAC-TV and then on NBC (her first television, but second show to feature that title). Like her sitcom, she had creative control over the series, and was able to hire a female director. In a first for American network variety television, her show featured an African-American performer, but the show faced criticism for the inclusion of tap dancer Arthur Duncan as a regular cast member. The criticism followed when NBC expanded the show nationally. Local Southern stations in the Jim Crow era threatened to boycott unless Duncan was removed from the series. In response, White said &quot;I&#x27;m sorry. Live with it&quot;, and gave Duncan more airtime. Initially a ratings success, the show repeatedly changed time slots and suffered lower viewership. By the end of the year, NBC quietly cancelled the series.

==== &quot;Life with Elizabeth&quot; (1953–1955) ====
In 1952, the same year that she began hosting &quot;Hollywood on Television&quot;, White co-founded Bandy Productions with writer George Tibbles and Don Fedderson, a producer. The trio worked to create new shows using existing characters from sketches shown on &quot;Hollywood on Television&quot;. White, Fedderson, and Tibbles created the television comedy &quot;Life with Elizabeth&quot;, with White portraying the title character. The show was originally a live production on KLAC-TV in 1951, and won White a Los Angeles Emmy Award in 1952. &quot;Life with Elizabeth&quot; was nationally syndicated from 1953 to 1955, allowing White to become one of the few women in television with full creative control in front of and behind the camera. The show was unusual for a sitcom in the 1950s because it was co-produced and owned by a twenty-eight-year-old woman who still lived with her parents. White said they did not worry about relevance in those days, and that usually the incidents were based on real-life situations that happened to her, Del Moore (who played Alvin), and the writer. White also performed in television advertisements seen on live television in Los Angeles, including a rendition of the &quot;Dr. Ross Dog Food&quot; advertisement at KTLA during the 1950s. She guest-starred on &quot;The Millionaire&quot; in the 1956 episode &quot;The Virginia Lennart Story&quot;, as the owner of a small-town diner who receives an anonymous gift of $1 million.

Following the end of &quot;Life with Elizabeth&quot;, she appeared as Vicki Angel on the ABC sitcom &quot;Date with the Angels&quot; from 1957 to 1958. As originally intended, the show, loosely based on the Elmer Rice play &quot;Dream Girl&quot;, would focus on Vicki&#x27;s daydreaming tendencies. However, the sponsor was not pleased with the fantasy elements and was pressured to have them eliminated. &quot;I can honestly say that was the only time I have ever wanted to get out of a show&quot;, White later said. The sitcom was a critical and rating disaster, but ABC would not allow White to break her contractual agreement and required her to fill the remaining thirteen weeks in their deal. Instead of a retooled version of the sitcom, White rebooted her old talk/variety show, &quot;The Betty White Show&quot;, which aired until her contract was fulfilled.

The sitcom did give White some positive experiences: she first met Lucille Ball while working on it, as both &quot;Date With the Angels&quot; and &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; were filmed on the same Culver Studios lot. The two quickly struck up a friendship over their accomplishments in taking on the male-dominated television business of the 1950s. They relied on one another through divorce, illness, personal loss, and even competed against one another on various game shows. In July 1959, White made her professional stage debut in a week-long production of the play, &quot;Third Best Sport&quot;, at the Ephrata Legion Star Playhouse in Ephrata, Pennsylvania.

==== Game and talk show appearances ====
By the 1960s, White was a staple of network game shows and talk shows: including both Jack Paar&#x27;s and later Johnny Carson&#x27;s tenure on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. She made many appearances on the hit &quot;Password&quot; show as a celebrity guest from 1961 through 1975. She married the show&#x27;s host, Allen Ludden, in 1963. She subsequently appeared on the show&#x27;s three updated versions, &quot;Password Plus&quot;, &quot;Super Password&quot;, and &quot;Million Dollar Password&quot;. White made frequent game show appearances on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; (starting in 1955), &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; (in 1961, 1990, and 2015), &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; (in 1972–73), &quot;Match Game&quot; (1973–1982), and &quot;Pyramid&quot; (starting in 1982). She made her feature film debut as fictional Kansas Senator Elizabeth Ames Adams in the 1962 drama &quot;Advise &amp; Consent&quot;; in 2004, on talk show &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;, host Brian Lamb remarked on White&#x27;s longevity as an actress besides the fact she was playing a strong female senator in 1962. He and Donald A. Ritchie noted that viewers would have seen the Senator Adams character to reflect Margaret Chase Smith. In 1963, White starred in a production of &quot;The King and I&quot; at the St. Louis Municipal Opera Theatre, with Charles Korvin co-starring as the king.

NBC offered her an anchor job on their flagship breakfast television show &quot;Today&quot;. She turned the offer down because she did not want to move permanently to New York City (where &quot;Today&quot; is produced). The job eventually went to Barbara Walters. Through the 1950s and 1960s, White began a nineteen-year run as hostess and commentator on the annual Rose Parade broadcast on NBC (co-hosting with Roy Neal and later Lorne Greene), and appeared on a number of late-night talk shows, including Jack Paar&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and various other daytime game shows.

===1973–1992: Established star ===
==== &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; (1973–1977) ====

White made several appearances in the fourth season (1973–74) of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, as the &quot;man-hungry&quot; Sue Ann Nivens. &quot;We need somebody who can play sickeningly sweet, like Betty White&quot;, Moore suggested at a production meeting, which resulted in the casting of White herself. Although considering the role a highlight of her career, White described the character&#x27;s image as &quot;icky sweet&quot;, feeling she was the very definition of feminine passivity, owing to the fact she always satirized her own persona onscreen in just such a way. &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; producers made Sue Ann Nivens a regular character and brought White into the main cast starting with the fifth season, after Valerie Harper, who played Rhoda Morgenstern, left the program. A running gag was how Sue Ann&#x27;s aggressive, cynical personality was the complete opposite of her relentlessly perky TV persona on the fictional WJM-TV show, &quot;The Happy Homemaker&quot;. White won two Emmy Awards back-to-back, in 1975 and 1976, for her role in the hugely popular series.

Mary Tyler Moore and her husband Grant Tinker were close friends with White and her husband Allen Ludden. In a 2010 The Interviews: An Oral History of Television interview, Moore explained that producers, aware of Moore and White&#x27;s friendship, were initially hesitant to audition White for the role, for fear that if she did not work out, it would create awkwardness between the two.

In 1975, NBC replaced White as commentator hostess of the Tournament of Roses Parade, feeling that she was identified too heavily with rival network CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;. White admitted to &quot;People&quot; that it was difficult &quot;watching someone else do my parade&quot;, although she would soon start a ten-year run as hostess of the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade for CBS. Following the end of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; in 1977, White was offered her own sitcom on CBS, her fourth, entitled &quot;The Betty White Show&quot; (the first of the name running a quarter century earlier), in which she co-starred with John Hillerman and former &quot;Mary Tyler Moore&quot; co-star Georgia Engel. Running up against &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; in its timeslot, the ratings were poor and it was canceled after one season.

White appeared several times on&quot; The Carol Burnett Show&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; appearing in many sketches, and began guest-starring in a number of television movies and television miniseries, including &quot;With This Ring&quot;, &quot;The Best Place to Be&quot;, &quot;Before and After&quot;, and &quot;The Gossip Columnist&quot;. In 1983, White became the first woman to win a Daytime Emmy Award in the category of &quot;Outstanding Game Show Host&quot;, for the NBC entry &quot;Just Men!&quot; Due to the amount of work she did on them, she was deemed the &quot;First Lady of Game Shows&quot;.

==== &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; (1985–1992) ====
From 1983 to 1984, White had a recurring role playing Ellen Harper Jackson on the series &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;, along with future &quot;Golden Girls&quot; co-star Rue McClanahan. White had originated this character in a series of sketches on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; in the 1970s. In 1985, White scored her second signature role and the biggest hit of her career as the St. Olaf, Minnesota native Rose Nylund on &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;. The series chronicled the lives of four widowed or divorced women in their &quot;golden years&quot; who shared a home in Miami. &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, which also starred Bea Arthur, Estelle Getty, and Rue McClanahan, was immensely successful and ran from 1985 through 1992. White won one Primetime Emmy Award, for &quot;Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series&quot;, for the first season of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; and was nominated in that category every year of the show&#x27;s run (Getty was also nominated every year, but in the supporting actress category).

White had a strained relationship with her &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; co-star Bea Arthur on and off the set of their television show, commenting that Arthur &quot;was not that fond of me&quot; and that &quot;she found me a pain in the neck sometimes. It was my positive attitude – and that made Bea mad sometimes. Sometimes if I was happy, she&#x27;d be furious.&quot; After Arthur&#x27;s death in 2009, White said, &quot;I knew it would hurt, I just didn&#x27;t know it would hurt this much.&quot; Despite their differences, &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; was a positive experience for both actresses and they had great mutual respect for the show, their roles, and the achievements made as an ensemble cast.

White was originally offered the role of Blanche in &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, and Rue McClanahan was offered the role of Rose (the two characters being similar to roles they had played in &quot;Mary Tyler Moore&quot; and &quot;Maude&quot;, respectively). Jay Sandrich, the director of the pilot, suggested that since they had played similar roles in the past, they should switch roles, Rue McClanahan later said in a documentary on the series. White originally had doubts about her ability to play Rose, until Sandrich explained to her that Rose was &quot;terminally naive&quot;. White says &quot;if you told Rose you were so hungry you could eat a horse, she&#x27;d call the ASPCA.&quot;

&quot;The Golden Girls&quot; ended in 1992 after Arthur announced her decision to depart the series. White, McClanahan, and Getty reprised their roles as Rose, Blanche, and Sophia in the spin-off &quot;The Golden Palace&quot;. The series was short-lived, lasting only one season. In addition, White reprised her Rose Nylund character in guest appearances on the NBC shows &quot;Empty Nest&quot; and &quot;Nurses&quot;, both set in Miami.

=== 1993–2009: Continued roles ===
After &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; ended, White guest-starred on a number of television programs including &quot;Suddenly Susan&quot;, &quot;The Practice&quot;, and &quot;Yes, Dear&quot; where she received Emmy nominations for her individual appearances. She won an Emmy in 1996 for &quot;Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series&quot;, appearing as herself on an episode of &quot;The John Larroquette Show&quot;. In that episode, titled &quot;Here We Go Again&quot;, a parody on &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, a diva-like White convinces Larroquette to help write her memoir. At one point, &quot;Golden Girls&quot; co-stars McClanahan and Getty appear as themselves. Larroquette is forced to dress in drag as Bea Arthur, when all four appear in public as the &quot;original&quot; cast members. White also appeared in films such as &quot;Lake Placid&quot; (1999) and &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; (2003) during this time.

In December 2006, White joined the soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; in the role of Ann Douglas (where she would make 22 appearances), the long-lost mother of the show&#x27;s matriarch, Stephanie Forrester, played by Susan Flannery. She also began a recurring role in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Boston Legal&quot; from 2005 to 2008 as the calculating, blackmailing gossip-monger Catherine Piper, a role she originally played as a guest star on &quot;The Practice&quot; in 2004.

White appeared several times on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; appearing in many sketches and returned to &quot;Password&quot; in its latest incarnation, &quot;Million Dollar Password&quot;, on June 12, 2008, (episode #3), participating in the Million Dollar challenge at the end of the show. On May 19, 2008, she appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, taking part in the host&#x27;s &quot;Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; reunion special alongside every surviving cast member of the series.
Beginning in 2007, White was featured in television commercials for PetMed Express, highlighting her interest in animal welfare.

==== &quot;The Proposal&quot; (2009) ====

In 2009, White starred in the romantic comedy &quot;The Proposal&quot; alongside Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Also in 2009, the candy company Mars, Incorporated launched a global campaign for their Snickers bar; the campaign&#x27;s slogan was: &quot;You&#x27;re not you when you&#x27;re hungry&quot;. White appeared, alongside Abe Vigoda, in the company&#x27;s advertisement for the candy during the 2010 Super Bowl XLIV. The advertisement became popular, and won the top spot on the Super Bowl Ad Meter.

===2010–2021: Career resurgence===

Following the success of the Snickers advertisement, a grassroots campaign on Facebook called &quot;Betty White to Host SNL (Please)&quot; began in January 2010. The group was approaching 500,000 members when NBC confirmed on March 11, 2010, that White would in fact host &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on May 8. The appearance made her, at age 88, the oldest person to host the show, beating Miskel Spillman, the winner of &quot;SNL&quot;″s &quot;Anybody Can Host&quot; contest, who was 80 when she hosted in 1977. In her opening monologue, White thanked Facebook and joked that she &quot;didn&#x27;t know what Facebook was, and now that I do know what it is, I have to say, it sounds like a huge waste of time.&quot; The appearance earned her a 2010 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. White and Jean Smart are the only actresses to have wins in all three comedy Emmy categories. 
==== &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; (2010–2015) ====

In June 2010, White took on the role of Elka Ostrovsky, the house caretaker on TV Land&#x27;s original sitcom &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; along with Valerie Bertinelli, Jane Leeves, and Wendie Malick. &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; was TV Land&#x27;s first attempt at a first-run scripted comedy (the channel has rerun other sitcoms since its debut). White was only meant to appear in the pilot of the show but was asked to stay on for the entire series. In 2011, she was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series&quot; for her role as Elka, but lost to Julie Bowen for &quot;Modern Family&quot;. The series ran for six seasons, a total of 128 episodes, with the hour-long final episode airing on June 3, 2015.

White also starred in the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; presentation of &quot;The Lost Valentine&quot; on January 30, 2011 (this presentation garnered the highest rating for a &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; presentation in the previous four years and according to the Nielsen Media Research TV rating service won first place in the prime time slot for that date), and from 2012 to 2014, White hosted and executive produced &quot;Betty White&#x27;s Off Their Rockers&quot;, in which senior citizens play practical jokes on the younger generation. For this show, she received three Emmy nominations.
A Betty White calendar for 2011 was published in late 2010. The calendar features photos from White&#x27;s career and with various animals. She also launched her own clothing line on July 22, 2010, which features shirts with her face on them. All proceeds go to various animal charities she supported.

White&#x27;s success continued in 2012 with her first Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Recording for her bestseller &quot;If You Ask Me&quot;. She also won the UCLA Jack Benny Award for Comedy, recognizing her significant contribution to comedy in television, and was roasted at the New York Friars Club. A television special, &quot;Betty White&#x27;s 90th Birthday Party&quot;, aired on NBC a day before her birthday on January 16, 2012. The show featured appearances of many stars whom White worked with over the years as well as a message from then sitting president Barack Obama. In January 2013, NBC once again celebrated White&#x27;s birthday with a TV special featuring celebrity friends, including former president Bill Clinton; the special aired on February 5.

On February 15, 2015, White made her final appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; when she attended the &quot;40th Anniversary Special&quot;. She participated in &quot;The Californians&quot; sketch alongside members of the current &quot;SNL&quot; cast as well as Bill Hader, Taylor Swift and Kerry Washington. In the memorable sketch White ends up kissing Bradley Cooper.

On August 18, 2018, White&#x27;s career was celebrated in a PBS documentary called &quot;Betty White: First Lady of Television&quot;. The documentary was filmed over a period of ten years, and featured archived footage and interviews from colleagues and friends. In 2019, White appeared in Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story 4&quot;, providing the voice of Bitey White, a toy tiger that was named after her. The other toys she shared a scene with were named and played by Carol Burnett, Carl Reiner, and Mel Brooks. White commented that &quot;It was wonderful the way they incorporated our names into the characters ... And I&#x27;m a sucker for animals, so the tiger was perfect!&quot;

====&quot;Betty White: A Celebration&quot; (2022)====

In December 2021, before White&#x27;s death, it was announced that a new documentary-style film about her, &quot;Betty White: A Celebration&quot; would be released in U.S. theatres on what would have been her 100th birthday, January 17, 2022. It features a cast of friends including Ryan Reynolds, Tina Fey, Robert Redford, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, Jay Leno, Carol Burnett, Craig Ferguson, Jimmy Kimmel, Valerie Bertinelli, James Corden, Wendie Malick, and Jennifer Love Hewitt. In addition to the planned documentary, &quot;People&quot; magazine featured her as the cover story of its January 10, 2022, newsstand publication and a separate commemorative edition to celebrate the anticipated milestone, which were released days before her death.

Following White&#x27;s death, producers Steve Boettcher and Mike Trinklein of the event distributors Fathom Events announced in a Facebook post that the pre-filmed production would be going ahead as scheduled.

==Achievements and honors==
White won five Primetime Emmy Awards, two Daytime Emmy Awards (including the 2015 Daytime Emmy for Lifetime Achievement), and received a Los Angeles Emmy Award in 1952. White was the first woman to have received an Emmy in all performing comedic categories, and also holds the record for longest span between Emmy nominations for performances—her first was in 1951 and her last was in 2014, a span of over 60 years. In 2015, she received the Lifetime Achievement Daytime Emmy. She also won three American Comedy Awards (including a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1990), and two Viewers for Quality Television Awards. She was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1995 and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at Hollywood Boulevard alongside the star of her late husband Allen Ludden. In 2009, White received the TCA Career Achievement Award from the Television Critics Association.
In 1955 she was named the honorary Mayor of Hollywood. White was the recipient of The Pacific Pioneer Broadcasters Golden Ike Award and the Genii Award from the Alliance for Women in Media in 1976. The American Comedy Awards awarded her the award for Funniest Female in 1987 as well as the list of lifetime achievement awards in 1990.

The American Veterinary Medical Association awarded White with its Humane Award in 1987 for her charitable work with animals. The City of Los Angeles further honored her for her philanthropic work with animals in 2006 with a bronze commemorative plaque near the Gorilla Exhibit at the Los Angeles Zoo. The City of Los Angeles named her &quot;Ambassador to the Animals&quot; at the dedication ceremony.

In September 2009, the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) announced plans to honor White with the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award at the 16th Screen Actors Guild Awards. Actress Sandra Bullock presented White with the award on January 23, 2010, at the ceremony, which took place at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. She was a Kentucky Colonel. In 2009, White and her &quot;Golden Girls&quot; cast mates Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan, and Estelle Getty were awarded Disney Legends awards. White was inducted into the California Hall of Fame in December 2010. In 2010, she was chosen as the Associated Press&#x27;s Entertainer of the Year.

On November 9, 2010, the USDA Forest Service, along with Smokey Bear, made White an honorary forest ranger, fulfilling her lifelong dream. White said in previous interviews that she wanted to be a forest ranger as a little girl but that women were not allowed to do that then. When White received the honor, more than one-third of Forest Service employees were women.

In January 2011, White received a SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series for her role as Elka Ostrovsky in &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;. The show itself was also nominated for an award as Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series, but it lost to the cast of &quot;Modern Family&quot;. She won the same award again in 2012 and later received a third nomination.

In October 2011, White was awarded an honorary degree and a white doctor&#x27;s coat by Washington State University at the Washington State Veterinary Medical Association&#x27;s centennial gala in Yakima, Washington.

A 2011 poll conducted by Reuters and Ipsos revealed that White was considered the most popular and most trusted celebrity among Americans, beating the likes of Denzel Washington, Sandra Bullock, and Tom Hanks.

In 2017, after 70 years in the industry, White was invited to become a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. At age 95, this made her the oldest new member at the time.

In 2025, the United States Postal Service unveiled a new stamp that features White on it. It is a Forever stamp and features White with the words &quot;Forever USA&quot; under her.

==Personal life==

While volunteering with the American Women&#x27;s Voluntary Services, White met Air Force P-38 pilot Dick Barker. After the war, they were married in 1945 and moved to Belle Center, Ohio, where Barker owned a chicken farm; he wanted to embrace a simpler life, but White did not enjoy doing so. They returned to Los Angeles and divorced within a year. She married Hollywood talent agent Lane Allen in 1947, and they divorced in 1949 because he wanted to start a family but she wanted to focus on her career rather than having children.

On June 14, 1963, White married television host Allen Ludden, whom she had met as a celebrity guest on his game show &quot;Password&quot; in 1961. Her legal name was changed to Betty Marion Ludden. He proposed to her at least twice before she accepted, and they remained married until he died from stomach cancer in Los Angeles on June 9, 1981. The couple appeared together in an episode of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; featuring Felix&#x27;s and Oscar&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Password&quot;.

Writer John Steinbeck was in White and Ludden&#x27;s group of high-profile friends, and White wrote about the friendship in her 2011 book &quot;If You Ask Me (And of Course You Won&#x27;t)&quot;. Ludden had attended the same school as actress Elaine Anderson (Steinbeck&#x27;s future wife) and Steinbeck later gave an early draft of his Nobel Prize in Literature acceptance speech to Ludden as a birthday gift. The couple also had a close friendship with blind musician and motivational speaker Tom Sullivan, whom they had met in 1968 while Sullivan was singing in a small club at the same time that White and Ludden were performing in a play on Cape Cod. White and Sullivan co-wrote a book, &quot;Leading Lady&quot;, about Sullivan&#x27;s first seeing eye dog, who lived with White after being retired.&lt;ref name=&quot;people/white-friend-sullivan&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

White and Ludden had no children together, though she was the stepmother of his three children with Margaret McGloin Ludden, who had died of cancer in 1961. During an interview on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, she was asked why she never remarried after Ludden&#x27;s death. She replied, &quot;Once you&#x27;ve had the best, who needs the rest?&quot; When asked by James Lipton on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; in 2010 what she would like God to say to her if Heaven exists, she replied, &quot;Come on in, Betty. Here&#x27;s Allen.&quot;

White attended the Unity Church, part of the New Thought movement.

==Death==
On December 25, 2021, White suffered a stroke.&lt;ref name=&quot;hollywoodreporter/1235072921&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of December 31, she died in her sleep at her home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles at the age of 99. Her remains were cremated.

White&#x27;s death was met with statements of sympathy and tributes from many people and organizations around the world. The United States Army released a statement, as White had volunteered with the American Women&#x27;s Voluntary Services during World War II. The Martin Luther King Jr. Center also offered their condolences and praised White for her early support of racial equality. There were additional tributes from numerous media organizations, entertainers, political commentators, sports teams, politicians, and other public figures. White&#x27;s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was flooded with flowers and tributes within hours of the announcement of her death.

White&#x27;s two California homes in Brentwood and Carmel were sold in April and June 2022 respectively, with her personal belongings sold at auction that September and the proceeds donated to several charities. Her estate also donated a substantial portion of her television memorabilia to the National Comedy Center, including wardrobe pieces, annotated notes, and five of her Emmy Awards.

== Causes and advocacy ==
===Animal welfare===
White was a pet enthusiast and animal welfare advocate, who worked with organizations including the Los Angeles Zoo Commission, The Morris Animal Foundation, African Wildlife Foundation, and Actors and Others for Animals. Her interest in animal welfare began in the early 1970s while she was producing and hosting the syndicated series &quot;The Pet Set&quot;, which spotlighted celebrities and their pets. As of 2009, White was the president emerita of the Morris Animal Foundation, where she served as a trustee of the organization beginning in 1971. She was a member of the board of directors of the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association since 1974. Additionally, White served the association as a Zoo Commissioner for eight years.

According to the Los Angeles Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden&#x27;s &quot;ZooScape&quot; member newsletter, White hosted &quot;History on Film&quot; from 2000 to 2002. White donated nearly $100,000 to the zoo in the month of April 2008 alone. White served as a judge at the 2011 American Humane Hero Dog Awards ceremony.

White served as a judge alongside Whoopi Goldberg and Wendy Diamond for American Humane&#x27;s Hero Dog Awards on the Hallmark Channel on November 8, 2011.

===Racial equality===
In 1954, as &quot;The Betty White Show&quot; became national across the United States, White was criticized by many in the Southern states for having Arthur Duncan, a Black tap dancer, on her variety show and was asked to remove him. In the 2018 documentary &quot;Betty White: First Lady of Television&quot;, White recalled threats to take the show off-air &quot;if we didn&#x27;t get rid of Arthur, because he was Black.&quot; She refused, saying &quot;he stays, live with it&quot;.

In 2017, sixty-three years after the show was canceled, Duncan appeared as a surprise guest on the series premiere of the reality talent series &quot;Little Big Shots: Forever Young&quot;, where he performed and reunited with White, later thanking her again for her support.

===LGBT rights===
A supporter and advocate of LGBT rights, White said in 2010, &quot;If a couple has been together all that timeand there are gay relationships that are more solid than some heterosexual onesI think it&#x27;s fine if they want to get married. I don&#x27;t know how people can get so anti-something. Mind your own business, take care of your affairs, and don&#x27;t worry about other people so much.&quot; In a 2011 interview, she revealed that she always knew her close friend Liberace was gay and that she sometimes accompanied him to premieres to help him hide it.

== Discography ==
In September 2011, White teamed up with English singer Luciana to produce a remix of her song &quot;I&#x27;m Still Hot&quot;. The song was released digitally on September 22 and the video later premiered on October 6. It was made for a campaign for a life settlement company, The Lifeline Program, and it is her only commercial single to date, peaking at number 1 on the Dance Club Songs chart. White also covered songs on her live television shows, such as &quot;Nevertheless I&#x27;m in Love with You&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Good Day&quot;, &quot;Getting to Know You&quot; and &quot;A &#x27;No&#x27; That Sounds like &#x27;Yes&#x27;&quot;.

==Filmography==
==Bibliography==
White published several books. In August 2010, she entered a deal with G.P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons to produce two more books, the first of which, &quot;If You Ask Me (And of Course You Won&#x27;t)&quot;, was released in 2011. In February 2012, White received a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Recording for the audio recording of the book.

<text>A postage stamp booklet (also called stamp book) is a booklet made up of one or more small panes of postage stamps in a cardboard cover. Booklets are often made from sheets especially printed for this purpose, with a narrow selvage at one side of the booklet pane for binding. From the cutting, the panes are usually imperforate on the edges of the booklet. Smaller and easier to handle than a whole sheet of stamps, in many countries booklets have become a favored way to purchase stamps.

== History ==
Booklets of telegraph stamps are known to have been issued by the California State Telegraph Company in 1870, and by Western Union in 1871, and on 14 October 1884 an A.W. Cooke of Boston received Patent 306,674 from the United States Patent Office for the idea of putting postage stamps into booklets.

Luxembourg was the first country to issue booklets, in 1895, followed by Sweden in 1898, the United States in 1900 and Great Britain in 1904. The idea became popular and quickly spread around the world.

== Production ==
Originally booklets were produced manually, by separating sheets into smaller panes and binding those. These are not distinguishable from the sheet stamps. Later, the popularity of booklets meant that it was worthwhile to produce booklet panes directly; printing onto large sheets, then cutting into booklet panes each with a small number of stamps, and perforating between the stamps of each pane. Such sheets, in fact, were created to produce the earliest United States booklets, printed from special plates that yielded sheets of 180 or 360 stamps for cutting into panes of six stamps each. (Normal sheets containing 400 stamps were deemed unusable for booklets because they could not be cut into six-stamp panes without leaving waste.) Booklet stamps so produced usually have one, two, or three straight edges (although some booklet panes have been printed three stamps across, and the middle stamps will have perforations all around). The first two U. S. booklet issues (1900 and 1903) offered only stamps denominated at the normal letter rate (2¢), but in 1907 booklets were introduced containing 1¢ stamps suitable for post cards.

Some countries, such as Sweden, routinely issue a single stamp design in coils, booklets, and sheets. The complete stamp collection will contain examples of each of these. Some collectors specialize in collecting the booklets themselves, or whole panes from a booklet; these often sell at a premium over the equivalent number of stamps. The oldest types of booklets were not much noticed at the time, nearly all used for postage, and intact booklets are quite rare today.

<text>Thomas Galloway Dunlop du Roy de Blicquy Galbraith, 2nd Baron Strathclyde, (born 22 February 1960), known informally as Tom Strathclyde, is a British Conservative politician. Lord Strathclyde served in the political role of Leader of the House of Lords from the 2010 general election until January 2013 and as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, having been Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords (1998–2010). As of 2025, he is the most recent hereditary peer to serve as Leader of the Lords.

==Biography==
Thomas Galbraith was born in Glasgow, the son of Conservative politician Tam Galbraith and his Belgian wife Simone du Roy de Blicquy. His father was MP for Glasgow Hillhead from 1948 until his death in 1982. Galbraith succeeded to the barony in 1985 at the age of 25, following the death of his grandfather Thomas Galbraith, 1st Baron Strathclyde. He contested the Merseyside East constituency in the 1984 European election.

==Education==

Galbraith was educated at Sussex House School, in London, and Wellington College near Sandhurst, Berkshire. He attended the University of East Anglia, where he graduated in 1982 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in modern languages and European studies. He also studied at Aix-Marseille University.

==House of Lords==
Strathclyde entered the House of Lords in 1986, becoming a Junior Whip in 1988, then Minister for Tourism in 1989. Between 1990 and 1992, he was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in the Scottish Office. He then served in the Department of the Environment and the Department of Trade and Industry, before being appointed the Conservative Party Chief Whip in the House of Lords in 1994, succeeding Lord Ullswater. The next year, he was sworn of the Privy Council.

In 1998 Strathclyde, along with the Conservative front bench in the Lords, threatened to tender his resignation if the party refused to accept a proposed compromise plan for reform of the Lords that had been negotiated with the Labour Party by Lord Cranborne, the Conservatives&#x27; leader in the Lords, unbeknown to the Leader of the Opposition (in the Commons) William Hague, and to his annoyance. Hague, however, accepted the proposals, dismissing Cranborne for the conduct in negotiations, and Strathclyde was appointed to succeed him. Under his leadership, the House of Lords Act 1999 passed: under this, Strathclyde was elected by other peers as one of the 92 hereditary peers to remain in the House of Lords.

He won Channel 4 Peer of the Year 2000, and Spectator Peer of the Year 2004.

When the Conservatives formed a coalition government under David Cameron in May 2010, Strathclyde became Leader of the House of Lords and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, with a seat in the Cabinet.

On 7 January 2013, Strathclyde announced that he would be stepping down as Leader of the House of Lords, and resigning from the Cabinet with immediate effect, to pursue a second business career. He was succeeded by Lord Hill of Oareford. He was subsequently appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour for his services to the Lords.

==Marriage and children== 
Strathclyde married Jane Skinner, elder daughter of John Skinner, in 1992. They have three daughters:

* The Hon. Elizabeth Ida Skinner Galbraith (born 1 December 1993)
* The Hon. Annabel Jane Simone Skinner Galbraith (born 15 May 1996)
* The Hon. Rose Marie Louise Skinner Galbraith (born 27 January 1999)

The family lives in Westminster and at the Galbraith family estate in Mauchline, Ayrshire.

As Strathclyde has no sons, the heir presumptive to the peerage is his younger brother, the Hon. Charles William du Roy de Blicquy Galbraith (born 1962).

==Outside interests==
Lord Strathclyde is a governor of Wellington College, Berkshire. He received an Honorary Doctorate of Civil Law from the University of East Anglia in July 2018.

He is a director of Auchendrane Estates Ltd, a landowning company in Scotland. His wealth is estimated at £10m.

He was a non-executive director on the board of Trafigura&#x27;s hedge-fund arm, Galena Asset Management, from 2004 until 2009. Trafigura defended court actions during the 2006 Ivory Coast toxic waste dump scandal and &quot;The Guardian&quot; suggested his appointment may be an attempt to de-toxify the Dutch company globally.

<text>The Unmentionables is a 1963 Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on September 7, 1963, and stars Bugs Bunny.

==Plot==
Against the backdrop of the Roaring Twenties, characterized by jazz, evolving fashion trends, lively dance soirées, and rampant mobster activity, Bugs, under the guise of Agent Elegant Mess, is tasked by his superior to penetrate the criminal underworld of Chicago.

During his journey, Bugs encounters the notorious duo Rocky and Mugsy, who apprehend and attempt to dispose of him in Lake Michigan, employing the notorious &quot;concrete shoes&quot; method. However, Bugs resourcefully utilizes a pipe as a snorkel to evade peril.

Subsequently, Bugs disrupts Rocky&#x27;s birthday celebration by cleverly infiltrating the event disguised as a flapper, ultimately exposing himself and orchestrating Rocky&#x27;s arrest under the guise of a police inspector. Despite Rocky&#x27;s resistance, Bugs ingeniously employs a carrot, which conceals a surprising mechanism, to subdue the criminals.

A pursuit ensues, culminating in a confrontation within the confines of an ACME Cereal Factory. Through cunning manipulation of the factory&#x27;s machinery, Bugs successfully incapacitates Rocky and Mugsy, leading to their apprehension and subsequent sentencing to twenty years of labor at Juliet Prison.

In a comedic twist, Bugs finds himself inadvertently shackled with his adversaries, having misplaced the keys to their restraints.

==Production notes==
&quot;The Unmentionables&quot; parodies the television crime drama series&quot;The Untouchables&quot;. Ralph James delivers an impression of Walter Winchell&#x27;s frenetic narration, a distinctive feature of the show.

Notably, this production marked a departure from the convention of crediting Mel Blanc alone for voice roles in Warner Bros. cartoons, as Ralph James received credit for his contribution. Conversely, Julie Bennett&#x27;s voice work went uncredited in this instance.

<doc id="415056" wikidata="Q17163118" url="?curid=415056" title="Classic RISC pipeline">
<text>In the history of computer hardware, some early reduced instruction set computer central processing units (RISC CPUs) used a very similar architectural solution, now called a classic RISC pipeline. Those CPUs were: MIPS, SPARC, Motorola 88000, and later the notional CPU DLX invented for education.

Each of these classic scalar RISC designs fetches and tries to execute one instruction per cycle. The main common concept of each design is a five-stage execution instruction pipeline. During operation, each pipeline stage works on one instruction at a time. Each of these stages consists of a set of flip-flops to hold state, and combinational logic that operates on the outputs of those flip-flops.

==The classic five stage RISC pipeline==
===Instruction fetch===
The instructions reside in memory that takes one cycle to read. This memory can be dedicated to SRAM, or an Instruction Cache. The term &quot;latency&quot; is used in computer science often and means the time from when an operation starts until it completes. Thus, instruction fetch has a latency of one clock cycle (if using single-cycle SRAM or if the instruction was in the cache). Thus, during the Instruction Fetch stage, a 32-bit instruction is fetched from the instruction memory.

The program counter (PC) is a register that holds the address that is presented to the instruction memory. The address is presented to instruction memory at the start of a cycle. Then during the cycle, the instruction is read out of instruction memory, and at the same time, a calculation is done to determine the next PC. The next PC is calculated by incrementing the PC by 4, and by choosing whether to take that as the next PC or to take the result of a branch/jump calculation as the next PC. Note that in classic RISC, all instructions have the same length. (This is one thing that separates RISC from CISC ). In the original RISC designs, the size of an instruction is 4 bytes, so always add 4 to the instruction address, but don&#x27;t use PC + 4 for the case of a taken branch, jump, or exception (see delayed branches, below). (Note that some modern machines use more complicated algorithms (branch prediction and branch target prediction) to guess the next instruction address.)

===Instruction decode===
Another thing that separates the first RISC machines from earlier CISC machines, is that RISC has no microcode. In the case of CISC micro-coded instructions, once fetched from the instruction cache, the instruction bits are shifted down the pipeline, where simple combinational logic in each pipeline stage produces control signals for the datapath directly from the instruction bits. In those CISC designs, very little decoding is done in the stage traditionally called the decode stage. A consequence of this lack of decoding is that more instruction bits have to be used to specifying what the instruction does. That leaves fewer bits for things like register indices.

All MIPS, SPARC, and DLX instructions have at most two register inputs. During the decode stage, the indexes of these two registers are identified within the instruction, and the indexes are presented to the register memory, as the address. Thus the two registers named are read from the register file. In the MIPS design, the register file had 32 entries.

At the same time the register file is read, instruction issue logic in this stage determines if the pipeline is ready to execute the instruction in this stage. If not, the issue logic causes both the Instruction Fetch stage and the Decode stage to stall. On a stall cycle, the input flip flops do not accept new bits, thus no new calculations take place during that cycle.

If the instruction decoded is a branch or jump, the target address of the branch or jump is computed in parallel with reading the register file. The branch condition is computed in the following cycle (after the register file is read), and if the branch is taken or if the instruction is a jump, the PC in the first stage is assigned the branch target, rather than the incremented PC that has been computed. Some architectures made use of the Arithmetic logic unit (ALU) in the Execute stage, at the cost of slightly decreased instruction throughput.

The decode stage ended up with quite a lot of hardware: MIPS has the possibility of branching if two registers are equal, so a 32-bit-wide AND tree runs in series after the register file read, making a very long critical path through this stage (which means fewer cycles per second). Also, the branch target computation generally required a 16 bit add and a 14 bit incrementer. Resolving the branch in the decode stage made it possible to have just a single-cycle branch mis-predict penalty. Since branches were very often taken (and thus mis-predicted), it was very important to keep this penalty low.

===Execute===
The Execute stage is where the actual computation occurs. Typically this stage consists of an ALU, and also a bit shifter. It may also include a multiple cycle multiplier and divider.

The ALU is responsible for performing Boolean operations (and, or, not, nand, nor, xor, xnor) and also for performing integer addition and subtraction. Besides the result, the ALU typically provides status bits such as whether or not the result was 0, or if an overflow occurred.

The bit shifter is responsible for shift and rotations.

Instructions on these simple RISC machines can be divided into three latency classes according to the type of the operation:

* Register-Register Operation (Single-cycle latency): Add, subtract, compare, and logical operations. During the execute stage, the two arguments were fed to a simple ALU, which generated the result by the end of the execute stage.
* Memory Reference (Two-cycle latency). All loads from memory. During the execute stage, the ALU added the two arguments (a register and a constant offset) to produce a virtual address by the end of the cycle.
*Multi-cycle Instructions (Many cycle latency). Integer multiply and divide and all floating-point operations. During the execute stage, the operands to these operations were fed to the multi-cycle multiply/divide unit. The rest of the pipeline was free to continue execution while the multiply/divide unit did its work. To avoid complicating the writeback stage and issue logic, multicycle instruction wrote their results to a separate set of registers.

===Memory access===

If data memory needs to be accessed, it is done in this stage.

During this stage, single cycle latency instructions simply have their results forwarded to the next stage. This forwarding ensures that both one and two cycle instructions always write their results in the same stage of the pipeline so that just one write port to the register file can be used, and it is always available.

For direct mapped and virtually tagged data caching, the simplest by far of the numerous data cache organizations, two SRAMs are used, one storing data and the other storing tags.

===Writeback===

During this stage, both single cycle and two cycle instructions write their results into the register file.
Note that two different stages are accessing the register file at the same time—the decode stage is reading two source registers, at the same time that the writeback stage is writing a previous instruction&#x27;s destination register. 
On real silicon, this can be a hazard (see below for more on hazards). That is because one of the source registers being read in decode might be the same as the destination register being written in writeback. When that happens, then the same memory cells in the register file are being both read and written the same time. On silicon, many implementations of memory cells will not operate correctly when read and written at the same time.

==Hazards==

Hennessy and Patterson coined the term &quot;hazard&quot; for situations where instructions in a pipeline would produce wrong answers.

===Structural hazards===

Structural hazards occur when two instructions might attempt to use the same resources at the same time. Classic RISC pipelines avoided these hazards by replicating hardware. In particular, branch instructions could have used the ALU to compute the target address of the branch. If the ALU were used in the decode stage for that purpose, an ALU instruction followed by a branch would have seen both instructions attempt to use the ALU simultaneously. It is simple to resolve this conflict by designing a specialized branch target adder into the decode stage.

===Data hazards===

Data hazards occur when an instruction, scheduled blindly, would attempt to use data before the data is available in the register file.

In the classic RISC pipeline, Data hazards are avoided in one of two ways:

====Solution A. Bypassing====

Bypassing is also known as operand forwarding.

Suppose the CPU is executing the following piece of code:

SUB r3,r4 -&gt; r10 ; Writes r3 - r4 to r10
AND r10,r3 -&gt; r11 ; Writes r10 &amp; r3 to r11

The instruction fetch and decode stages send the second instruction one cycle after the first. They flow down the pipeline as shown in this diagram:

In a &quot;naive pipeline&quot;, without hazard consideration, the data hazard progresses as follows:

In cycle 3, the codice_1 instruction calculates the new value for codice_2. In the same cycle, the codice_3 operation is decoded, and the value of codice_2 is fetched from the register file. However, the codice_1 instruction has not yet written its result to codice_2. Write-back of this normally occurs in cycle 5 (green box). Therefore, the value read from the register file and passed to the ALU (in the Execute stage of the codice_3 operation, red box) is incorrect.

Instead, we must pass the data that was computed by codice_1 back to the Execute stage (i.e. to the red circle in the diagram) of the codice_3 operation &quot;before&quot; it is normally written-back. The solution to this problem is a pair of bypass multiplexers. These multiplexers sit at the end of the decode stage, and their flopped outputs are the inputs to the ALU. Each multiplexer selects between:
# A register file read port (i.e. the output of the decode stage, as in the naive pipeline): arrow
# The current register pipeline of the ALU (to bypass by one stage): arrow
# The current register pipeline of the access stage (which is either a loaded value or a forwarded ALU result, this provides bypassing of two stages): arrow. Note that this requires the data to be passed &quot;backwards&quot; in time by one cycle. If this occurs, a bubble must be inserted to stall the codice_3 operation until the data is ready.

Decode stage logic compares the registers written by instructions in the execute and access stages of the pipeline to the registers read by the instruction in the decode stage, and cause the multiplexers to select the most recent data. These bypass multiplexers make it possible for the pipeline to execute simple instructions with just the latency of the ALU, the multiplexer, and a flip-flop. Without the multiplexers, the latency of writing and then reading the register file would have to be included in the latency of these instructions.

Note that the data can only be passed &quot;forward&quot; in time - the data cannot be bypassed back to an earlier stage if it has not been processed yet. In the case above, the data is passed forward (by the time the codice_3 is ready for the register in the ALU, the codice_1 has already computed it).

====Solution B. Pipeline interlock====

However, consider the following instructions:

LD adr -&gt; r10
AND r10,r3 -&gt; r11

The data read from the address codice_13 is not present in the data cache until after the Memory Access stage of the codice_14 instruction. By this time, the codice_3 instruction is already through the ALU. To resolve this would require the data from memory to be passed backwards in time to the input to the ALU. This is not possible. The solution is to delay the codice_3 instruction by one cycle. The data hazard is detected in the decode stage, and the fetch and decode stages are stalled - they are prevented from flopping their inputs and so stay in the same state for a cycle. The execute, access, and write-back stages downstream see an extra no-operation instruction (NOP) inserted between the codice_14 and codice_3 instructions.

This NOP is termed a pipeline &quot;bubble&quot; since it floats in the pipeline, like an air bubble in a water pipe, occupying resources but not producing useful results. The hardware to detect a data hazard and stall the pipeline until the hazard is cleared is called a pipeline interlock.

A pipeline interlock does not have to be used with any data forwarding, however. The first example of the codice_1 followed by codice_3 and the second example of codice_14 followed by codice_3 can be solved by stalling the first stage by three cycles until write-back is achieved, and the data in the register file is correct, causing the correct register value to be fetched by the codice_3&#x27;s Decode stage. This causes quite a performance hit, as the processor spends a lot of time processing nothing, but clock speeds can be increased as there is less forwarding logic to wait for.

This data hazard can be detected quite easily when the program&#x27;s machine code is written by the compiler. The Stanford MIPS machine relied on the compiler to add the NOP instructions in this case, rather than having the circuitry to detect and (more taxingly) stall the first two pipeline stages. Hence the name MIPS: Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages. It turned out that the extra NOP instructions added by the compiler expanded the program binaries enough that the instruction cache hit rate was reduced. The stall hardware, although expensive, was put back into later designs to improve instruction cache hit rate, at which point the acronym no longer made sense.

===Control hazards===

Control hazards are caused by conditional and unconditional branching. The classic RISC pipeline resolves branches in the decode stage, which means the branch resolution recurrence is two cycles long. There are three implications:

* The branch resolution recurrence goes through quite a bit of circuitry: the instruction cache read, register file read, branch condition compute (which involves a 32-bit compare on the MIPS CPUs), and the next instruction address multiplexer.
* Because branch and jump targets are calculated in parallel to the register read, RISC ISAs typically do not have instructions that branch to a register+offset address. Jump to register is supported.
* On any branch taken, the instruction immediately after the branch is always fetched from the instruction cache. If this instruction is ignored, there is a one cycle per taken branch IPC penalty, which is adequately large.

There are four schemes to solve this performance problem with branches:

* Predict Not Taken: Always fetch the instruction after the branch from the instruction cache, but only execute it if the branch is not taken. If the branch is not taken, the pipeline stays full. If the branch is taken, the instruction is flushed (marked as if it were a NOP), and one cycle&#x27;s opportunity to finish an instruction is lost.
* Branch Likely: Always fetch the instruction after the branch from the instruction cache, but only execute it if the branch was taken. The compiler can always fill the branch delay slot on such a branch, and since branches are more often taken than not, such branches have a smaller IPC penalty than the previous kind.
* Branch Delay Slot: Depending on the design of the delayed branch and the branch conditions, it is determined whether the instruction immediately following the branch instruction is executed even if the branch is taken. Instead of taking an IPC penalty for some fraction of branches either taken (perhaps 60%) or not taken (perhaps 40%), branch delay slots take an IPC penalty for those branches into which the compiler could not schedule the branch delay slot. The SPARC, MIPS, and MC88K designers designed a branch delay slot into their ISAs.
* Branch Prediction: In parallel with fetching each instruction, guess if the instruction is a branch or jump, and if so, guess the target. On the cycle after a branch or jump, fetch the instruction at the guessed target. When the guess is wrong, flush the incorrectly fetched target.

Delayed branches were controversial, first, because their semantics are complicated. A delayed branch specifies that the jump to a new location happens &quot;after&quot; the next instruction. That next instruction is the one unavoidably loaded by the instruction cache after the branch.

Delayed branches have been criticized as a poor short-term choice in ISA design:
* Compilers typically have some difficulty finding logically independent instructions to place after the branch (the instruction after the branch is called the delay slot), so that they must insert NOPs into the delay slots.
* Superscalar processors, which fetch multiple instructions per cycle and must have some form of branch prediction, do not benefit from delayed branches. The Alpha ISA left out delayed branches, as it was intended for superscalar processors.
* The most serious drawback to delayed branches is the additional control complexity they entail. If the delay slot instruction takes an exception, the processor has to be restarted on the branch, rather than that next instruction. Exceptions then have essentially two addresses, the exception address and the restart address, and generating and distinguishing between the two correctly in all cases has been a source of bugs for later designs.

==Exceptions==

Suppose a 32-bit RISC processes an ADD instruction that adds two large numbers, and the result does not fit in 32 bits.

The simplest solution, provided by most architectures, is wrapping arithmetic. Numbers greater than the maximum possible encoded value have their most significant bits chopped off until they fit. In the usual integer number system, 3000000000+3000000000=6000000000. With unsigned 32 bit wrapping arithmetic, 3000000000+3000000000=1705032704 (6000000000 mod 2^32). This may not seem terribly useful. The largest benefit of wrapping arithmetic is that every operation has a well defined result.

But the programmer, especially if programming in a language supporting large integers (e.g. Lisp or Scheme), may not want wrapping arithmetic. Some architectures (e.g. MIPS), define special addition operations that branch to special locations on overflow, rather than wrapping the result. Software at the target location is responsible for fixing the problem. This special branch is called an exception. Exceptions differ from regular branches in that the target address is not specified by the instruction itself, and the branch decision is dependent on the outcome of the instruction.

The most common kind of software-visible exception on one of the classic RISC machines is a &quot;TLB miss&quot;.

Exceptions are different from branches and jumps, because those other control flow changes are resolved in the decode stage. Exceptions are resolved in the writeback stage. When an exception is detected, the following instructions (earlier in the pipeline) are marked as invalid, and as they flow to the end of the pipe their results are discarded. The program counter is set to the address of a special exception handler, and special registers are written with the exception location and cause.

To make it easy (and fast) for the software to fix the problem and restart the program, the CPU must take a precise exception. A precise exception means that all instructions up to the excepting instruction have been executed, and the excepting instruction and everything afterwards have not been executed.

To take precise exceptions, the CPU must &quot;commit&quot; changes to the software visible state in the program order. This in-order commit happens very naturally in the classic RISC pipeline. Most instructions write their results to the register file in the writeback stage, and so those writes automatically happen in program order. Store instructions, however, write their results to the Store Data Queue in the access stage. If the store instruction takes an exception, the Store Data Queue entry is invalidated so that it is not written to the cache data SRAM later.

==Cache miss handling==

Occasionally, either the data or instruction cache does not contain a required datum or instruction. In these cases, the CPU must suspend operation until the cache can be filled with the necessary data, and then must resume execution. The problem of filling the cache with the required data (and potentially writing back to memory the evicted cache line) is not specific to the pipeline organization, and is not discussed here.

There are two strategies to handle the suspend/resume problem. The first is a global stall signal. This signal, when activated, prevents instructions from advancing down the pipeline, generally by gating off the clock to the flip-flops at the start of each stage. The disadvantage of this strategy is that there are a large number of flip flops, so the global stall signal takes a long time to propagate. Since the machine generally has to stall in the same cycle that it identifies the condition requiring the stall, the stall signal becomes a speed-limiting critical path.

Another strategy to handle suspend/resume is to reuse the exception logic. The machine takes an exception on the offending instruction, and all further instructions are invalidated. When the cache has been filled with the necessary data, the instruction that caused the cache miss restarts. To expedite data cache miss handling, the instruction can be restarted so that its access cycle happens one cycle after the data cache is filled.

<doc id="415058" wikidata="Q796469" url="?curid=415058" title="BMW 1 Series (E87)">
<text>The first generation of the BMW 1 Series consists of the BMW E81 (3-door hatchback), BMW E82 (coupe), BMW E87 (5-door hatchback) and BMW E88 (convertible) compact cars. The E81/E82/E87/E88 generation was produced from 2004 until 2013 and is sometimes collectively referred to as the E8x. The E8x replaced the 3 Series Compact as the entry-level models of the BMW range.

The chassis has an aluminum multi-link suspension, and a rear-wheel drive layout with a longitudinally-mounted engine giving 50:50 weight balance, which was a rare configuration for a hatchback as most cars in this market segment use front-wheel drive. The engines available were four-cylinder turbo-diesel, four-cylinder naturally aspirated petrol, six-cylinder naturally aspirated petrol and six-cylinder turbocharged petrol (the latter only available on coupe and convertible models).

The highest performance trim is the 1 Series M Coupé which was powered by the BMW N54 turbocharged inline-six engine mated to a six-speed manual transmission. It was produced in only the coupe body style and is considered the predecessor to the BMW M2.

Following the introduction of the F20/F21 1 Series in 2011, the E81/E87 hatchback models began to be phased out, while the E82/E88 coupes and convertibles remained in production until 2013, when they were replaced by the F22/F23 2 Series models.

== Development and launch ==
Initially, BMW considered adopting the Rover R30 design program into the upcoming 1 Series; however, it was eventually decided to develop the E8x alongside the E90 3 Series. The E8x shares approximately 60% of components with the E90, including front and rear suspension, structure, chassis, engines, drivetrain, hardware and electronic elements.

The 1 Series was developed under design director Chris Bangle, At the 2002 Geneva Motor Show, the &quot;CS1 Concept&quot; previewed the 1 Series design. with Christopher Chapman leading the exterior design for the hatchback models.

The first 1 Series production models – in the E87 five-door hatchback body style – were launched at the Paris Motor Show in September 2004.

In May 2005, in a commercial for the 1 Series Hatchback, Kermit the Frog was shown driving a BMW 1 Series around in a desert making figure-eights, showcasing the car&#x27;s agility.

In 2012, a number of 1 Series vehicles were stolen in the United Kingdom, due to thieves programming a blank key fob to start the car through the on-board diagnostics (OBD) connection. This security flaw was later patched, for both existing vehicles and new cars produced since.

=== Model year changes ===
====2007====
In March 2007, the E87 five-door hatchback received a facelift (also called LCI). Changes included the N43 four-cylinder engine replacing the N45 and N46 engines, various changes to improve fuel economy (marketed as &quot;EfficientDynamics&quot;), electric power steering replacing the traditional hydraulic power steering, revised bumpers and interior changes.

In May 2007, the E81 three-door hatchback models were released.

In November 2007, the E82 coupe models were released, followed by the E88 convertible models soon after.

==== 2010 ====
In 2010 (2011 Model Year), the E82 coupé and E88 convertible models received a facelift. Changes included headlights and taillight revisions, new front/rear bumpers and minor revisions to the interior. For the 135i model, the N55 engine replaced the N54. Even though many engines are the same, the facelifted 1 Series fuel consumption is slightly higher in some models such as the 123d, and slightly lower in some models such as the 120i.


== Body styles ==
Reviews of the 1 Series&#x27; exterior styling were mixed, with the unusual proportions of the hatchback model often receiving criticism.

=== 5-door hatchback (E87) ===
The 1 Series was launched globally in September 2004 as the E87 five-door hatchback.

The E87 was produced from 2004 until 2011, with the model range consisting of the 116i, 116d, 118i, 118d, 120i, 120d, 123d and 130i. Kerb Weight: 1340 kg (2954 lbs.).
=== 3-door hatchback (E81) ===
The E81 three-door hatchback models were produced from July 2007 until 2012.

As per the five-door body style, the model range consisted of the 116i, 116d, 118i, 118d, 120i, 120d, 123d and 130i. The overall length is the same as the five-door models, and the kerb weight is lighter.
=== 2-door coupe (E82) ===
The 1 Series Coupé (E82) was unveiled in 2007 at the Frankfurt Motor Show and went on sale on 24 November 2007.

The model range consisted of the 118d, 118i, 120i, 120d, 123d, 125i, 125se, 128i, 135i, 135is, and the M Coupé. In North America, the E82 went on sale in October 2007 with the 128i and the 135i models. The E82 was produced until August 2013.
=== 2-door convertible (E88) ===
The E88 convertible models were produced from 2007 until June 2013. The model range consisted of the 118d, 118i, 120i, 120d, 123d, 125i, 128i, 135i, and 135is.

The E88 uses a fabric roof (unlike the E93 3 Series convertible, which uses a folding metal roof).
== Engines ==
The factory specifications are as follows:

===Petrol===
In most countries, the 135i is the top model of the E82/E88 coupe/convertible range (excluding the limited production 1M Coupe). From 2007 to 2010, the 135i was powered by the N54 twin-turbo 3.0-litre engine with a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. From 2010, the 135i engine was upgraded to the N55 single-turbo 3.0-litre engine with a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. The differential fitted to the 135i uses double-helical ball bearings, which operate at a lower temperature and reach operating temperature quicker, due to a reduction of fluid required in the differential. The 135i brakes are 6-piston front calipers and 2-piston rear calipers, with disk sizes of 338 mm and 324 mm respectively.

Another E82/E88 coupe/convertible trim sold only in the United States and Canada was the 128i, which was powered by a version of the 3.0 litre BMW N52 inline-6 engine.

The 130i is the top model of the E81/E87 hatchback range and was released in September 2004. It is powered by the N52 3.0-litre naturally aspirated engine and transmission choices were a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic.

===Diesel===
=== Transmissions ===
In early 2006, the 5-speed manual transmission was phased out in favour of the 6-speed Getrag GS6 gearbox.

Several 6-speed automatic transmissions were used- the ZF 6HP for the 135i, GM 6L50 for the 128i, and GM 6L45 for 116i. A 7-speed Getrag dual-clutch transmission (&quot;DCT&quot;) was available for the 135i model from 2010.

=== BMW Performance upgrades ===
BMW offered a &quot;performance power kit&quot; in two stages for the N55 engine. Stage 1 included an ECU remap with a power boost from 225 kW to 240 kW and 30Nm of extra torque – now peaking at 430Nm. If installed in an automatic 335i or 135i the torque peak is bumped up by another 20Nm to 450Nm. 

Stage 2 added some additional engine cooling through an additional supplementary radiator and larger cooling fan.
Other upgrade options included a modified rear bumper and performance rear muffler. These options were all included as standard on the US spec 135iS.

==Special editions==
=== 1 Series M Coupé ===
The BMW 1 Series M Coupé (often referred to as the &quot;1M&quot;) is the high-performance model of the E82 coupe range, sold under the BMW M performance sub-brand. While BMW naming convention would have called the car the &quot;M1&quot;, an alternate name was chosen to avoid confusion with the BMW M1 supercar from the 1970&#x27;s.

At the 2007 Tokyo Auto Show, BMW unveiled the &quot;1 Series tii Concept&quot;, which was thought to be a preview of the M version of the 1 Series. However, the eventual 1M model appeared four years later and with significant differences, such as an engine with six-cylinders instead of four.

The 1M was BMW M&#x27;s second turbocharged engine (after the S63 V8 which debuted in the X6M). The BMW N54 fitted to the 1M was originally being used in the &quot;E89 Z4 sDrive35is&quot; and has rated outputs of at 5,900 rpm and from 1,500 to 4,500 rpm. An additional is produced during overboost taking overall peak torque to . The sole transmission available was a six-speed manual.

The front and rear track widths were widened by and respectively and a limited-slip differential was used. As a result, the overall width is . The curb weight is .

Initial plans were to limit production of the 1M Coupe to 2,700 units, but the final production total was 6,309.

The 1M Coupe placed third in the &quot;Evo Magazine&quot; 2011 Car of the Year awards. It also featured on &quot;Top Gear&quot; on 26 June 2011 and recorded a time of 1:25.0 around the Top Gear test track under damp conditions and received &quot;Richard Hammond&#x27;s Car of the Year 2011&quot; award in the &quot;Top Gear&quot; magazine.

=== ActiveE electric car trial ===

The &quot;BMW ActiveE&quot; was an electric car based on the E82 coupe that was produced in small quantities for demonstration and testing purposes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rated the range as and the energy consumption as 33 kW·h per . The cars were leased to customers for two years, following which they were taken off the road. A total of 1,100 vehicles were produced, with 700 of these being delivered to U.S. customers beginning in January 2012.

=== Motorsports ===

In 2006, a BMW 120d modified with a BMW customer racing kit entered by &quot;Schubert Motors&quot; placed 5th at the Nurburgring 24 Hours in a field of 220 cars.

Beric Lynton won the 2014 Australian Production Car Championship driving a BMW 1M.

In 2019, the UK based 750 Motor Club introduced a one make mini endurance series using the 2004-2006 116i car. Modified from factory production specifications with a coil over suspension kit, reworked motorsport exhaust and re-programmed ECU the cars race in a 90-minute multiple driver format. For 2020, the series attracted regular grids of over 25 cars with more than 50 cars having been built by both privateers and professional teams. 
=== BMW 135is (United States and Canada) ===
The 135is coupe and convertible model was sold only for the 2013 model year in the United States and Canada. In other markets, the next generation F20 1 Series had replaced the E82/E88 by this stage, with the top-of-the-line M135i sharing the same engine as the 135is.

The 135is is powered by an upgraded version of the N55 engine which produces and , an additional 20 hp and 17 lb-ft of torque over the 135i. Other upgrades include sports suspension, an M Sport body kit, and 18-inch wheels.

==Production and sales==
The 1 Series was built in Regensburg and Leipzig, Germany.

The E8x accounted for nearly one-fifth of the total BMW sales in 2008.

<doc id="415060" wikidata="Q10672913" url="?curid=415060" title="Socialist Campaign Group">
<text>The Socialist Campaign Group, also simply known as the Campaign Group, is a UK parliamentary caucus of the Labour Party including Members of Parliament in the House of Commons. The group also includes some MPs who formerly represented Labour in Parliament but have had the whip withdrawn or been expelled from the party.

The group was formed in 1982 following the 1981 Labour deputy leadership election when a number of soft left MPs, led by Neil Kinnock, refused to back Tony Benn&#x27;s campaign, leading a number of left-wing Benn-supporting MPs to split from the Tribune Group to form the Campaign Group. It was at a meeting of the Campaign Group in 2015 that the decision was taken that Jeremy Corbyn would contest for the leadership of the Labour Party. The Campaign Group maintains close links with Momentum.

== Origins ==

The Socialist Campaign Group was founded in 1982 due to a disagreement within the Labour left, traditionally organised around the Tribune Group, about whom to back in the 1981 Labour Party deputy leadership election. Tony Benn&#x27;s decision to challenge Denis Healey for the Deputy Leadership of the Labour Party in 1981 was heavily criticised by Labour&#x27;s leader Michael Foot, who had long been associated with the Labour left and Tribune Group. Tribune Group member and future Labour leader Neil Kinnock led a number of Labour MPs to support John Silkin in the deputy leadership election and abstain in the run-off between Healey and Benn. This sowed the seeds for a split in the left between a &quot;soft left&quot; supportive of Foot&#x27;s leadership and a dissenting &quot;hard left&quot; organised principally around Benn.

The Campaign Group would go on to back Eric Heffer and Michael Meacher in their unsuccessful bids for the leadership and deputy leadership in 1983. The Campaign Group subsequently organised itself around opposition to the direction the party took under the leadership of Kinnock and his successors. An advertisement in &quot;Tribune&quot; (24 April 1983) gave the membership of the Campaign Group as: Norman Atkinson, Tony Benn, Ron Brown, Dennis Canavan, Bob Cryer, Don Dixon, Martin Flannery, Stuart Holland, Bob Litherland, Joan Maynard, Willie McKelvey, Andy McMahon, Bob McTaggart, Michael Meacher, Bob Parry, Reg Race, Allan Roberts, Ernie Roberts, Dennis Skinner, and John Tilley.

== Activities and campaigns ==

=== During Kinnock&#x27;s leadership of the Party ===
Neil Kinnock was hostile to the Campaign Group. He pursued a &quot;carrot and stick&quot; approach to undermining the Campaign Group by promoting MPs who were willing to leave the Campaign Group and renounce their previously held views and by isolating those who remained members.
==== 1984–85 miners&#x27; strike ====
During the 1984–85 miners&#x27; strike, MPs from the Socialist Campaign Group took action to support the striking miners by visiting picket lines and raising money to be donated to the miners&#x27; relief centres. This put pressure on the Labour Party leadership to support the strike, something Neil Kinnock resisted until 10 months after the start of the strike. Members of the Socialist Campaign Group also led a &quot;direct action protest&quot; in the House of Commons by refusing to sit down in order to force a debate on the strike.

==== Anti-poll tax campaign ====

In 1989, the third Conservative Government of Margaret Thatcher announced plans to introduce a flat-tax to fund local Government. The planned tax became known as the poll tax and was thought by many to be intended to save the rich money and move the expenses onto the poor.

Only 15 Labour MPs supported the Anti Poll Tax Federation. Socialist Campaign Group MPs made up a significant number of these including Tony Benn, who gave his full support to the campaign and spoke at the 200,000 strong anti-Poll Tax demonstration in Trafalgar Square, and Jeremy Corbyn who appeared at Highbury Magistrates&#x27; Court in 1991 for not paying his poll tax bill of £481. Corbyn was in court alongside 16 other Islington residents all opposing the levy on grounds other than inability to pay. He told &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper &quot;I am here today because thousands of people who elected me just cannot afford to pay.&quot;

The scale of public opposition in both polls and in the streets have been identified as one of the key causes of the end of Thatcher&#x27;s premiership. Labour historians have identified the campaign against the Poll Tax as a &quot;huge victory&quot; for the Labour left who campaigned in alliance with the extra-parliamentary socialist left &quot;against one of the most reactionary pieces of legislation dreamt up in the modern age&quot;. Tony Benn described the relationship of the campaign against the Poll Tax with the Labour Party:

=== During the New Labour years ===
Following the 1997 General Election, 7% of Labour MPs were members of the Campaign Group.

Tony Blair enthusiastically carried on Kinnock&#x27;s attempts to &quot;delegitimise the left&quot;. He sought to reduce the number of left-wing Labour MPs by centralising control of candidate selections and used &quot;open shortlists in a fast and loose way, mainly to ensure that left candidates are excluded or defeated.&quot; Labour Party historian Alex Nunns described how &quot;Left-wing hopefuls, like Christine Shawcroft or Mark Seddon, were stopped at all costs. Party workers were tasked with personal lobbying for the leadership&#x27;s preferred choice, or were even told to chase up certain postal votes but not others.&quot;

Blair&#x27;s strategist Peter Mandelson reportedly described wanting the parliamentary left to become &quot;a sealed tomb&quot;. Alan Simpson, a member of the Campaign Group during the New Labour years, described it as &quot;the only bolt-hole of real political thought that I found throughout my parliamentary years ... they were the MPs you would always find on picket lines, at trade union and social movement rallies, on anti-war marches and at the forefront of campaigns to restore rather than exploit the planet.&quot;

==== Opposition to single parent benefit cuts ====
Under Blair, the Labour government introduced plans to cut lone parent benefit, a measure which members of the Campaign Group believed would disproportionately harm women. The cut was brought in by Harriet Harman, Secretary of State for Social Security, who championed the cut despite the majority of people affected being women and children who were already poor. Backbench Labour MPs, led by the Campaign Group, opposed these plans, speaking and voting against them in Parliament. Blair ally Patricia Hewitt was alleged to have described the rebellion as a &quot;conspiracy organised by the Socialist Campaign Group&quot;

47 Labour MPs voted against the proposals including Campaign Group members Ken Livingstone, Ronnie Campbell, Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, Ann Cryer, Alan Simpson, John McDonnell, Dennis Skinner, Audrey Wise, and Diane Abbott. Despite the scale of the opposition from Labour MPs and campaigners, Harman continued to implement the cuts. She was sacked from Cabinet the following year.

==== Opposition to the Iraq War and founding the Stop the War Coalition ====

The Stop the War Coalition was founded in the weeks following 9/11, when George W. Bush announced the &quot;War on terror&quot;, and has since campaigned to oppose and end the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and elsewhere. Socialist Campaign Group MPs Jeremy Corbyn and Tam Dalyell, along with Tony Benn, (who had been in the Socialist Campaign Group until he stood down as an MP at the 2001 General Election) were among the most high profile of the initial sponsors of the Stop the War Coalition at the meeting on 21 September 2001, along with figures such as Tariq Ali, Harold Pinter, Andrew Murray and Lindsey German, who became the convenor of Stop the War.

The Coalition organised what is widely thought to be the largest demonstration in British history, when on 15 February 2003, over a million people marched against the Iraq War. Campaign Group MP Alan Simpson launched Labour Against The War to coordinate parliamentary opposition to Tony Blair&#x27;s decision to follow George W. Bush in invading Iraq. Although Blair was able to win these votes with the support of Conservative MPs, 139 Labour MPs voted against his plans for war, one of the largest rebellions ever seen in the Commons.

==== Opposition to academisation ====
In 2005, Blair&#x27;s government announced plans to encourage every school to become an independent self-governing trust. These schools would, like academies, determine their own curriculum and ethos, appoint the governing body, control their own assets, employ their own staff and set their own admissions policy. These plans were described as intending to &quot;all but abolish local authority involvement in state schools&quot; and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott argued that it would &quot;condemn a generation of poorer children to ghettos of collapsing schools&quot;.

14 Campaign Group MPs, working with other Labour backbenchers, sought to block the plans by proposing an alternative plan for education. John McDonnell, then Chair of the Socialist Campaign Group, argued &quot;Our sincere hope is that the prime minister desists from relying upon a [David] Cameron coalition to force his education policies through in the face of this overwhelming opposition within the parliamentary Labour party.&quot; With Tory support, the reforms were eventually passed by 422 to 98 votes; however, this was the largest rebellion a Labour government had ever suffered at the third reading of a Bill.

=== Reform 2019–present ===
While Corbyn was party leader, from 2015 to 2019, Socialist Campaign Group activity reduced as many members joined the shadow cabinet. The rule that shadow cabinet MPs could not be group members caused difficulties, and this rule was removed, allowing the group to recover to 23 members by 2019.

In January 2020, the Socialist Campaign Group was reformed. It supported Rebecca Long-Bailey for Leader and Richard Burgon for Deputy Leader in the 2020 Labour Party leadership election, which was won by Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner, respectively. In October 2020, the Socialist Campaign Group produced a pamphlet called &quot;Winning the Future&quot;, which proposed solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Labour leadership elections ==
There have been nine Labour leadership elections since the formation of the Socialist Campaign Group: 1983, 1988, 1992, 1994, 2007, 2010, 2015, 2016, and 2020.

=== 1983 leadership election ===

The Campaign Group backed Eric Heffer and Michael Meacher in their unsuccessful bids for the leadership and deputy leadership in 1983. Tony Benn could not stand because he was not currently in Parliament at the time, having just lost his seat.

=== 1988 leadership election ===

During his time as Leader Neil Kinnock moved the Labour party to adopt centrist politics. In the 1987 general election, Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Conservatives won a landslide victory and were nearly 12% ahead of Labour in the popular vote. Following this defeat Kinnock introduced a Policy Review, which many on the left thought would lead to an abandonment of the party&#x27;s commitment to Clause IV, public ownership and the transformation of society. At a meeting of the Campaign Group following this election defeat, it was agreed that Tony Benn should stand against Kinnock in a leadership election, although Benn himself was reluctant to run. The decision to run led to a number of MPs leaving the Campaign Group including Clare Short, Margaret Beckett, Jo Richardson and Joan Ruddock.

Labour&#x27;s electoral college was weighted 40% to affiliated unions, 30% to Constituency Labour Parties (CLPs) and 30% to MPs in the Parliamentary Labour Party. Benn secured only 11.4% of the vote (17.2% of MPs, 19.6% of CLPs and 0.2% of affiliated unions). The scale of this defeat was a surprise to Benn, in particular the decline in support from CLPs since the 1983 election, and strengthened Kinnock&#x27;s position, which he used to take the party further towards centrism. Following this election, the party rules were changed to quadruple the number of MPs required to nominate a candidate to launch a leadership challenge from 5% to 20% (lowered in 1993 to 12.5% for elections where the incumbent had resigned).

=== 1992 leadership election ===

Neil Kinnock resigned just three days after he lost his second general election, and tried to persuade candidates other than John Smith to stand aside so as to avoid a contest. Rules introduced following Tony Benn&#x27;s 1988 leadership challenge meant that candidates would have to secure nominations from 55 MPs to make it onto the ballot paper. Three candidates sought nominations: John Smith, the favourite, regarded as being &quot;from the right&quot; of the party, Bryan Gould, from the &quot;centre-left&quot; and Ken Livingstone, the Campaign Group candidate.

Bernie Grant sought nominations as the Campaign Group candidate for Deputy Leader. John Prescott, Ann Clywd and Margaret Beckett were the other deputy leadership contenders. It quickly became clear that the 20% nomination threshold risked eliminating all candidates except Smith.

To avoid this party officials changed the rules mid-contest, at the suggestion of Gould, to allow MPs who had already nominated a candidate to withdraw and support another instead. This ensured that Gould received enough nominations to ensure a contest between him and Smith, and that Ken Livingstone and Bernie Grant were kept off the ballot. Margaret Beckett described this change as &quot;unprecedented&quot;. John Smith won the electoral college vote against Gould with 91% of the vote.

=== 1994 leadership election ===

No candidate from the Campaign Group ran in the 1994 leadership election and the group did not endorse a candidate. However, Margaret Beckett, who had been a member of the Campaign Group until 1988, was nominated by 18 Campaign Group MPs, with 5 nominating John Prescott. Beckett&#x27;s campaign was supported due to her position that Tory anti-union laws should be repealed and that anti-union changes to the party constitution should stop. No Campaign Group MPs backed Tony Blair, who went on to win the contest.

=== 2007 leadership election ===
In 2007, only 24 of 353 Labour MPs were members of the Socialist Campaign Group and party rules required nominations from 45 MPs (12.5% of the Parliamentary Labour Party) to make it onto the ballot paper.

Both John McDonnell, then Chair of the Campaign Group, and Michael Meacher, a member of the Campaign Group, sought nominations to run against Gordon Brown. Both McDonnell and Meacher agreed that whichever of them had the support of fewer Labour MPs at the point of Tony Blair&#x27;s resignation would withdraw from the campaign and support the other. However, although Meacher gave his support to McDonnell following Blair&#x27;s resignation not all of his supporters switched allegiance, leaving McDonnell short of the nominations required and leading to Gordon Brown becoming leader unopposed.

As part of his campaign, John McDonnell published his manifesto as a book entitled &quot;Another World Is Possible: A Manifesto for 21st Century Socialism.&quot;

=== 2010 leadership election ===
In 2010 nominations from 33 MPs (12.5% of the Parliamentary Labour Party) were required to make it onto the ballot paper. Socialist Campaign Group MPs John McDonnell and Diane Abbott both sought nominations to run; however, McDonnell withdrew from the race after it became clear he would not receive sufficient nominations, and instead supported Abbott to give her the best chance of making it onto the ballot. Abbott, the first black woman to ever contest the Labour leadership, secured the necessary 33 nominations after being &#x27;lent&#x27; nominations from a number of MPs who were not supporting her campaign but wanted to ensure that the contest was not exclusively white and male. It has been suggested that this practice of lending nominations to left candidate to widen the scope of debate &quot;set a precedent&quot; for Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s run for Leadership in 2015.

Despite beating both Andy Burnham and Ed Balls in total number of first preference votes cast (35,259 individual first preferences for Abbott compared to 28,772 for Burnham and 34,489 for Balls), Abbott was eliminated in the first round of voting, as she received fewer votes from MPs, and Ed Miliband went on to win the leadership election.. Abbott secured the first-preference votes of 7 MPs: Diane Abbott, Katy Clark, Jeremy Corbyn, Kelvin Hopkins, John McDonnell, Linda Riordan and Mike Wood.

=== 2015 leadership election ===
The 2015 leadership election was the first held under new rules introduced by Ed Miliband following the Collins Review which recommended moving to a one-member one vote (OMOV) system. This reduced the previous weighting in favour of MPs and Trade Unions. The Blairite wing of the Labour Party (including Blair himself) celebrated this reform, believing that the changes would mean that &quot;the next Labour leader will be a Blairite&quot;. At a meeting of the Socialist Campaign Group on 3 June it was decided that, with McDonnell and Abbott both ruling themselves out after having stood previously, Jeremy Corbyn should be the left&#x27;s candidate for leader. Corbyn was immediately nominated by Campaign Group MPs including John McDonnell (who became chair of his campaign), Diane Abbott, Ronnie Campbell, Kelvin Hopkins, Michael Meacher, Dennis Skinner, Richard Burgon, Clive Lewis and Cat Smith.

The campaign quickly mobilised grassroots Labour members and activists to pressure MPs to nominate Corbyn, even if they disagreed with him, in order to ensure a proper debate about the future of the Labour Party. Two minutes before the deadline Corbyn reached the threshold of 35 nominations, having been &#x27;lent&#x27; nominations from MPs who did not support him but were persuaded to nominate him by grassroots members and Campaign Group MPs. Margaret Beckett was one of those who nominated Corbyn despite disagreeing with him, and later described herself as a &quot;moron&quot; for doing so. Immediately following his success in getting on the ballot Corbyn attended a protest against the treatment of women detained at Yarls Wood Detention Centre and against the 13-year detention by the US of British resident Shaker Aamer in Guantanamo Bay without charge.

Corbyn outlined an anti-austerity domestic agenda and an international agenda opposed to military intervention. He campaigned on issues with wide popular support that had been outside of the political mainstream for many years, including rail re-nationalisation, free higher education, regional investment and a higher minimum wage. On 12 September 2015 Corbyn was elected Leader of the Labour Party in a landslide victory, with 59.5% of first-preference votes.

=== 2016 leadership election ===

During the 2016 referendum Corbyn led Labour in campaigning to remain. Corbyn spoke at 15 rallies from London to Hastings to Aberdeen, reached more than 10 million people with his Remain messages on social media, made six statements in the Commons and put forward Remain arguments during interviews on Sky, BBC, ITV and Channel 4. Analysis from academics at Loughborough University found that the BBC had excluded Labour voices during the campaign and instead covered the campaign as a Conservative Party civil war.

When the result of the referendum was announced Corbyn&#x27;s opponents on the right and centre of the Parliamentary Labour Party sought to trigger a leadership election on the grounds that they did not think he had campaigned sufficiently vigorously for Remain. MPs hostile to Corbyn leaked internal emails to the BBC which showed that Corbyn&#x27;s team had resisted moves to pursue a more hostile line on immigration and suggested that this was evidence that Corbyn had sought to &quot;sabotage&quot; the remain campaign. Anti-Corbyn MPs had been briefing the media &quot;for months to &quot;expect movement&quot; against Corbyn on 24 June&quot;, suggesting that the opposition to Corbyn was not primarily motivated by his actions during the referendum. In the days following the referendum a number of Corbyn&#x27;s critics resigned from the Shadow Cabinet and the parliamentary party passed a vote of no confidence in Corbyn by 172 votes against to 40 for. Corbyn promoted a number of Campaign Group MPs to fill his Shadow Cabinet including Richard Burgon, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Grahame Morris and Clive Lewis, and with their support along with that of other left wing MPs and the mobilisation of members by Momentum Corbyn refused to resign. Owen Smith secured the required nominations to run against him. Corbyn&#x27;s opponents in the National Executive Committee were alleged by Robert Peston to have sought to fix the results, by increasing the fee for becoming a registered supporter from £3 to £25 and excluding from voting the 130,000 new members who had joined in the previous 6 months.

On 24 September 2016, Corbyn was re-elected Leader of the Labour Party in another landslide victory, increasing his share of the vote from 59.5% to 61.8%.

=== 2020 leadership election ===
Following the 2019 general election, the Socialist Campaign Group reformed for 2019–2024. Campaign Group members Rebecca Long-Bailey and Richard Burgon ran for leader and deputy leader of the Labour Party, respectively. Both were defeated by Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner, respectively.

== Views ==
Although the Campaign Group did not require members to adhere to a particular set of policies, the group did occasionally set out statements of principle. The February 1988 edition of Campaign Group News included &quot;The Aims and Objectives of the Labour Party&quot; a statement agreed by the Campaign Group of Labour MPs and circulated &quot;to provide a focus for political discussion and education within the party ... and to be the basis of our long-term political work&quot;. The statement set out the ideological basis for Benn&#x27;s 1988 campaign to be Labour leader. The document outlines a socialist, internationalist, and democratic agenda and starts by listing the rights that members thought out to be fought for:
== Campaign Group News ==

First published in March 1986, &quot;Socialist Campaign Group News&quot; was the monthly magazine of the Campaign Group. The paper published articles by Campaign Group MPs alongside left wing Labour Party activists and trade unionists. Issues regularly covered included: women&#x27;s liberation, Black Sections, international liberation struggles, internal Labour Party democracy and elections, reports from the National Executive Committee, proposed resolutions for Labour Party Conference, socialist economic policy, disabled people&#x27;s rights, Northern Ireland and the Conservative Party.

 the editorial board was Jim Mortimer (chair), Diane Abbott MP, Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn MP, Anni Marjoram, Bill Michie MP and Pete Willsman. A website of the same name, providing electronic versions of some of the articles in the printed edition and lists of Campaign Group MPs, was run from 1999 to 2010.

<text>David Linsay Willetts, Baron Willetts, (born 9 March 1956) is a British politician and life peer. From 1992 to 2015, he was the Member of Parliament representing the constituency of Havant in Hampshire. He served as Minister of State for Universities and Science from 2010 until July 2014 and became a member of the House of Lords in 2015. He was appointed chair of the UK Space Agency&#x27;s board in April 2022. He is president of the Resolution Foundation.

==Education==

Willetts was educated at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham. He then studied philosophy, politics and economics at Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated with a first-class degree.

==Policy researcher==
Having served as Nigel Lawson&#x27;s private researcher, Willetts took charge of the Treasury monetary policy division at 26 before moving over to Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Policy Unit at 28. He subsequently took over the Centre for Policy Studies, aged 31.

Paul Foot wrote in &quot;Private Eye&quot; that in a 1993 document called &quot;The Opportunities for Private Funding in the NHS&quot;, published by the Social Market Foundation and financed by private healthcare company BUPA, Willetts provided the &quot;intellectual thrust&quot; for private finance initiatives (PFIs) in the National Health Service.

==First period in government==

Aged 36, Willetts entered Parliament in 1992 as the MP for Havant. He quickly established himself in Parliament, becoming a Whip, a Cabinet Office Minister, and then Paymaster General in his first term (when that role was split between the Cabinet Office and HM Treasury as a policy co-ordination role). During this period Willetts gained &quot;Two Brains&quot; as a nickname, a monicker reportedly coined by &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; former political editor Michael White. However, Willetts was forced to resign from the latter post by the Standards and Privileges Committee over an investigation into Neil Hamilton in 1996, when it found that he had &quot;dissembled&quot; in his evidence to the Committee over whether pressure was put onto an earlier investigation into Hamilton.

==Shadow Cabinet==
Despite the resignation, Willetts was able to return to the shadow front bench a few years later while William Hague was Leader of the Opposition, initially serving in the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Education Secretary before becoming Shadow Social Security (later Shadow Work and Pensions) Secretary. He carved out a reputation as an expert on pensions and benefits. Since leaving the DWP post, he has been recruited as an external consultant by the actuaries Punter Southall.

Following the 2005 election, he served as Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in the Shadow Cabinet under Michael Howard. In August 2005, after ruling out running for leader owing to a lack of support, commentators speculated that he was gunning for the post of Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer and would cut a deal with either David Davis or David Cameron. On 15 September he confirmed his support for Davis, at that time the bookies&#x27; favourite. Willetts, a centrist moderniser, went to ground following the announcement of the Davis tax plan since it was widely speculated that he disagreed with the seemingly uncosted and widely derided tax plan and found it impossible to defend. Davis then lost the candidacy race to Cameron.

Following Cameron&#x27;s win, Willetts was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Education and Skills in Cameron&#x27;s first Shadow Cabinet in December 2005, the role Cameron had vacated, later becoming Shadow Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills. His title became Shadow Minister for Universities and Skills since Gordon Brown&#x27;s merger of the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform into the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in June 2009.

On 19 May 2007, Willetts made a controversial speech on grammar schools in which he defended the existing Conservative Party policy of not reintroducing grammar schools. The speech received a mixed reception. The analysis was applauded by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;. However, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; was strongly critical of the speech, which was unpopular with some Conservative Party activists. The speech was made more controversial when David Cameron weighed into the argument, backing Willetts&#x27; speech and describing his critics as &quot;delusional&quot;, accusing them of &quot;splashing around in the shallow end of the educational debate&quot; and of &quot;clinging on to outdated mantras that bear no relation to the reality of life&quot;.

The Department for Education and Skills was abolished by the new Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, who established two new departments. On 2 July 2007, Cameron reshuffled Willetts down to the junior of the two departments: the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills.

==Second period in government==
Following the 2010 general election, Prime Minister David Cameron appointed Willetts as the Minister of State for Universities and Science.

===Feminism claim===
In June 2011, Willetts said during the launch of the Government&#x27;s social mobility strategy that movement between the classes had &quot;stagnated&quot; over the past 40 years, and Willetts attributed this partly to the entry of women into the workplace and universities for the lack of progress for men. &quot;Feminism trumped egalitarianism&quot;, he said, adding that women who would otherwise have been housewives had taken university places and well-paid jobs that could have gone to ambitious working-class men. He went on to say that, &quot;One of the things that happened over that period was that the entirely admirable transformation of opportunities for women meant that with a lot of the expansion of education in the 1960s, &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s, the first beneficiaries were the daughters of middle-class families who had previously been excluded from educational opportunities [...] And if you put that with what is called &#x27;assortative mating&#x27; – that well-educated women marry well-educated men – this transformation of opportunities for women ended up magnifying social divides. It is delicate territory because it is not a bad thing that women had these opportunities, but it widened the gap in household incomes because you suddenly had two-earner couples, both of whom were well-educated, compared with often workless households where nobody was educated&quot;.

===Tuition fees and student loan debts===
As the minister responsible for universities, Willetts was an advocate and spokesperson for the coalition government&#x27;s policy of increasing the cap on tuition fees in England and Wales from £3,225 to £9,000 per year.

In November 2013, Willetts announced the sale of student loans to Erudio Student Loans – a debt collection consortium – removing £160m from public debt but ignoring the implications for former students.

===Peerage and further ventures===
In July 2014, Willetts announced that he would not contest the next general election, saying that &quot;after more than 20 years the time has come to move onto fresh challenges.&quot; In October 2014, Willetts was appointed a visiting professor at King&#x27;s College London. It was announced that he was to be a life peer in the 2015 Dissolution Honours and was created Baron Willetts, of Havant in the County of Hampshire, on 16 October 2015. In June 2015, Willetts was appointed executive chair of the think tank the Resolution Foundation. In May 2018 he was elected a Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society. In February 2022 he was appointed a director of the Synbioven investment fund, and in April 2022 he was appointed chair of the board of the UK Space Agency.

===Brexit===
In December 2018, Willetts was one of the signatories of a statement by some senior Conservatives calling for a second referendum over Brexit. This stated, &quot;If we are to remain a party of government, it is absolutely critical that we increase our support among younger generations. To do this, we must listen to and engage with their concerns on Brexit. They voted overwhelmingly to Remain in the European Union in 2016 – and since then have become even stronger in their views. Since the referendum, nearly 2 million young people are now of voting age. Of those in this group who are certain to vote, an astounding 87% support the United Kingdom staying in the European Union. If we do not hear their voices, who could blame them for feeling excluded and powerless on this most vital issue. The truth is that if Brexit fails this generation, we risk losing young people for good. Our party&#x27;s electoral future will be irrevocably blighted.&quot; In early 2019, he co-founded the group Right to Vote.

==Free votes record==
According to the Public Whip analyses, Willetts was strongly in favour of an elected House of Lords and was strongly against the ban on fox hunting. TheyWorkForYou additionally records that, amongst other things, Willetts was strongly in favour of the Iraq War, strongly in favour of an investigation into it, moderately against equal gay rights, and very strongly for replacing Trident.

==Other interests==
Following his decision to stand down at the 2015 General Election, Willetts joined the Resolution Foundation in Summer 2015. He Chaired the Foundation&#x27;s Intergenerational Commission between 2016 and 2018, and is now President of the Resolution Foundation, along with its Intergenerational Centre. He is currently a visiting professor at King&#x27;s College London where he works with the Policy Institute at King&#x27;s, a visiting professor at the Cass Business School, a board member of the Institute for Fiscal Studies and a visiting fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford. On 9 February 2018, the University of Leicester announced they had elected David Willetts as successor to Bruce Grocott to become their new chancellor.

Willetts is the author of several books on conservatism, including &quot;Why Vote Conservative&quot; (1996) and &quot;Modern Conservatism&quot; (1992), as well as numerous articles. He was a founding signatory in 2005 of the Henry Jackson Society principles, advocating a proactive approach to the spread of liberal democracy across the world, including when necessary by military intervention. He is an honorary member of Conservative Friends of Poland.

==Civic conservatism==

Willetts has pioneered the idea of &quot;civic conservatism&quot;. This is the idea of focusing on the institutions between the state and individuals as a policy concern (rather than merely thinking of individuals and the state as the only agencies) and is one of the principles behind the increasing support in the Conservative Party&#x27;s localist agenda and its emphasis on voluntary organisations. During an interview with &quot;The Spectator&quot;, he was referred to as &#x27;the real father of Cameronism&#x27;.

Fourteen years after the publication of &quot;Civic Conservatism&quot; Willetts gave the inaugural Oakeshott Memorial Lecture to the London School of Economics in which he made an attempt to explain how game theory can be used to help think about how to improve social capital. The lecture was described by the Times as &quot;an audacious attempt by the Conservative Party&#x27;s leading intellectual to relate a new Tory narrative&quot;.

Civic conservatism, like free market economics, proceeds from deep-seated individual self-interest towards a stable cooperation. It sets the Tories the task not of changing humanity but of designing institutions and arrangements that encourage our natural reciprocal altruism.

==Personal life==
Willetts is married to artist Sarah Butterfield. The couple have one daughter, born 1988, and one son, born 1992. His wealth in 2009 was estimated at £1.9m.

==Honours==
Willetts was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 2010, giving him the honorific title &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; and after ennoblement the post nominal letters &quot;PC&quot; for life.

<doc id="415062" wikidata="Q7504268" url="?curid=415062" title="Shropshire Union Canal">
<text>The Shropshire Union Canal, sometimes nicknamed the &quot;Shroppie&quot;, is a navigable canal in England. The Llangollen and Montgomery canals are the modern names of branches of the Shropshire Union (SU) system and lie partially in Wales.

The canal lies in the counties of Staffordshire, Shropshire and Cheshire in the north-west English Midlands. It links the canal system of the West Midlands, at Wolverhampton, with the River Mersey and Manchester Ship Canal at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, distant.

The &quot;SU main line&quot; runs southeast from Ellesmere Port on the River Mersey to the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal at Autherley Junction in Wolverhampton. Other links are to the Llangollen Canal (at Hurleston Junction), the Middlewich Branch (at Barbridge Junction), which itself connects via the Wardle Canal with the Trent and Mersey Canal, and the River Dee (in Chester). With two connections to the Trent and Mersey (via the Middlewich Branch and the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal) the SU is part of an important circular and rural holiday route called the Four Counties Ring.

The SU main line was the last trunk narrow canal route to be built in England. It was not completed until 1835 and was the last major civil engineering accomplishment of Thomas Telford.

The name &quot;Shropshire Union&quot; comes from the amalgamation of the various component companies (Ellesmere Canal, Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, Montgomeryshire Canal) that came together to form the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company. The main line between Nantwich and Autherley Junction was almost built as a railway although eventually it was decided to construct it as a waterway.

== Route ==
=== Wirral Line ===
The canal starts from Ellesmere Port on the River Mersey traversing the Wirral peninsula to Chester. This stretch, which was completed in 1797, was originally part of the unfinished Ellesmere Canal. The industrial waterway was intended to connect the Port of Liverpool on the River Mersey to the River Severn at Shrewsbury via the North East Wales Coalfields. However, only eight years after the completion of the contour canal between Netherpool and Chester, the proposed project became uneconomical. This meant the planned mainline from Chester to Trevor Basin near Wrexham was never constructed. Instead the northern Wirral section was joined to the pre-existing Chester Canal; eventually becoming part of the network Shropshire Union.

Although the Ellesmere Canal was not completed as intended, the central section of the Ellesmere Canal was built. These sections now form part of the waterways: Llangollen Canal and Montgomery Canal. Both are actually branches of the Shropshire Union mainline, although in modern times they are considered to be separate canals.

=== Chester Canal ===
In Chester, from the top of the arm leading down to the Dee, the SU follows the old Chester Canal built in 1772 to connect Chester and Nantwich. The canal passes alongside the city walls of Chester in a deep, vertical red sandstone cutting. After Chester, there are only a few locks as the canal crosses the nearly flat Chester Plain, passes Beeston Castle, and the junctions at Barbridge and Hurleston and arrives at Nantwich basin, the original terminus of the Chester Canal.

The two junctions on this stretch are very important links in the English and Welsh connected network.
* At Barbridge, the Middlewich Branch of the SU goes northeast to Middlewich on the Trent and Mersey Canal (via the tiny Wardle Canal). This was the original planned main line of the Chester Canal, but was in fact built much later than the Nantwich stretch.
* At Hurleston, the old Ellesmere canal from Llangollen and Montgomery made a connection from Frankton Junction eastwards to the old Chester Canal after it was realised that the planned main line from Trevor to Chester along the Dee was never going to be built. This canal eventually merged with the Chester Canal and became the Llangollen Branch of the Shropshire Union. These waters are now known as the Llangollen Canal and (south from Frankton Junction, and still being restored) the Montgomery Canal.

=== Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal ===
The odd angle between Nantwich basin and the next stretch of the SU shows that the journey southwards is on a newer (and narrow) canal originally constructed as the narrow Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal to connect Nantwich, at the end of the Chester Canal, to the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal at Autherley Junction, near Wolverhampton. An important lost link can be seen at Norbury Junction, where a branch (1841) ran south-west through Newport to connect with the Shrewsbury Canal at Wappenshall Junction.

After Nantwich basin, a long sweeping embankment incorporating an aqueduct carries the canal across the main A534 Nantwich-Chester road. The canal then has to climb out of the Cheshire Plain by means of a flight of 15 locks at Audlem. The canal passes through the eastern suburbs of the town of Market Drayton in Shropshire. The canal then passes through Tyrley Locks and enters the Woodseaves Cutting (named after Woodseaves (Shropshire) but also known as Tyrley Canal Cutting), the longest cutting on any canal in Britain. It is about 2.7 km long and up to about 21.3m deep. Further south there are substantial lengths of embankment through the Staffordshire village of Knighton. There is an aqueduct south of Norbury Junction and deep cuttings at Loynton near Woodseaves (Staffordshire) and Grub Street.

The canal then continues as the Shelmore Embankment. Repeated soil slippage during construction meant that this was the last part of the B&amp;L Junction Canal to be opened to traffic. The lengthy embankment is equipped with flood gates at both ends to prevent loss of water should the canal be breached in this area. During World War II these locks were kept closed at night because of the risk of bomb damage.

At Gnosall the canal enters the Cowley Tunnel. Originally the tunnel was planned to be long, but after the rocky first , the ground was unstable, and the remaining length was opened out to form the present narrow and steep-sided Cowley Cutting.

At Wheaton Aston, the canal climbs its last lock to reach the summit level, fed by the Belvide Reservoir just north of Brewood. North of the reservoir, the canal passes by Stretton Aqueduct over Watling Street (the A5 road).

The SU terminates at Autherley Junction on the Staffs and Worcester Canal. Immediately before the junction is a very shallow stop lock built to prevent the loss of water to the new rival canal from the preexisting Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. Unusually, the B&amp;L Junction canal&#x27;s summit level was designed to be a few inches lower than the older canal, so the newer canal gains a small amount of water each time the lock is cycled (the reverse of the practice usually insisted on by canal companies as a condition for not opposing the construction of a newer one).

=== Onward links ===
The link with the Staffs and Worcester provides a choice of onward journeys:
* Northwards, the S&amp;W meets the Trent and Mersey at Great Haywood junction – allowing journeys east to the Leicester Branch of the Grand Union Canal (or the Trent) or north to the Potteries, Manchester, and the Pennines.
* Southwards, Aldersley Junction is only a mile away, connecting to the BCN Main Line of the Birmingham Canal Navigations (the maze of canals between Wolverhampton and Birmingham) and onwards to the Grand Union Canal main line and London.
* Beyond Aldersley, the S&amp;W is a very popular holiday route down to the River Severn at Stourport.

== Formation of the &quot;Shropshire Union&quot; company ==
The Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company was formed in 1846. The Ellesmere and Chester canals had amalgamated in 1813, and the absorption of the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal by the Ellesmere and Chester Company was authorised by an Act of Parliament passed in 1845. A further Act, passed in 1846, changed the name of the company to the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company and authorised the acquisition of the Shrewsbury Canal and other canals in the east Shropshire network (linking modern-day Telford with the River Severn to the south at Coalport). Then (in 1847), the latter was taken over by the London and North Western Railway Company, which allowed the Shrewsbury Canal and the branch from Norbury Junction to decline.

== 1945 bank failure ==
On 7 September 1945, the bank of the Llangollen branch of the canal failed near , Denbighshire. Escaping water washed away a section of the trackbed of the Ruabon to Barmouth railway line. A Great Western Railway mail and freight train was derailed, killing one person and injuring two others. The train&#x27;s consist was entirely destroyed in the ensuing fire, with the exception of a brake van.

== 2018 bank failure ==
A section of northern bank of the canal failed on 16 March 2018 at an aqueduct over the River Wheelock, near Middlewich, leaving 15 to 20 boats stranded on a stretch between Wardle Lock and Stanthorne Lock. One boat close to the deep hole had to be evacuated, and minor damage to one local&#x27;s garden was recorded. According to the Canal and River Trust, the breach was caused by a member of the public leaving open a paddle gate on a lock, allowing water into the section of the canal, and causing it to overflow. After emergency repairs costing £3 million, the Middlewich branch of the canal reopened on 21 December 2018.

== Restoration ==
To promote the interest in, use of, and restoration of parts of the Shropshire Union Canal, the Shropshire Union Canal Society was formed. Today their main restoration activities are on the Montgomery Canal, which is slowly being restored into Wales.

The canal in Chester is promoted by Chester Canal Heritage Trust.

<text>The River Dee (, ) is a river flowing through North Wales, and through Cheshire, England, in Great Britain. The length of the main section from Bala to Chester is , and it is largely located in Wales. The stretch between Aldford and Saltney is within England, and two other sections form the border between the two countries.

The river rises on Dduallt in Snowdonia and flows east through Bala Lake, Corwen, and Llangollen. It turns north near Overton-on-Dee and forms part of the England–Wales border before fully entering England north-east of Wrexham. It flows through Chester then re-enters Wales; the final section is canalised and discharges to the Irish Sea via an estuary long. 

==History==
The River Dee was the traditional boundary of the Kingdom of Gwynedd in Wales for centuries, possibly since its founding in the 5th century. It was recorded in the 13th century (in mainstream Middle English orthography, lacking the letters v and w) as &quot;flumen Dubr Duiu&quot;; the name appears to derive from the Brythonic &quot;dēvā&quot;: &quot;River of the Goddess&quot; or &quot;Holy River&quot;. The river is personified as the war and fate goddess Aerfen.

The river name inspired the name of Roman fortress &quot;Deva Victrix&quot;.

It is the only river in the UK to be subject to a Water Protection Zone along its whole length down to Chester weir.

==Statistics==
The total catchment area of the River Dee down to Chester Weir is . The estimated average annual rainfall over the catchment area is , yielding an average flow of 37 m3/s.
The larger reservoirs in the catchment area are:
*Bala Lake (): 
*Llyn Brenig: 
*Llyn Celyn: 

==Catchment==
===Natural course===


==== Source to Corwen ====
The River Dee has its source on the slopes of Dduallt above Llanuwchllyn in the mountains of Snowdonia in Meirionydd, Gwynedd, Wales. Between its source and Bala Lake the river is known by its Welsh name, &quot;Afon Dyfrdwy&quot;. Legend tells that the waters of the river pass through Bala Lake and emerge undiluted and unmixed at the outflow. On leaving Bala the river meets its confluence with Afon Tryweryn and passes through the Bala sluice gates, part of the Dee Regulation System protecting communities further downstream from severe flooding. Skirting the village of Llanfor, the path of the river takes it past Llandderfel and under the Grade II listed Pont Fawr bridge. The river trends generally northeast through the Vale of Edeyrnion, shadowed by the B4401 Bala to Cynwyd road. Leaving Gwynedd and entering Denbighshire the Dee flows beneath other historic bridges at Llandrillo and Cynwyd before arriving at the town of Corwen. 

==== Corwen to Llangollen ====
From here the river passes the Iron Age hillfort of Caer Drewyn and enters the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley AONB. Through its forested valley the course takes it through Carrog, Glyndyfrdwy and Llantysilio, with the Llangollen Railway following the river on its route between Llangollen and Corwen.

At Berwyn the river passes over the manmade Horseshoe Falls, before picking up speed on a downhill gradient past the Chain Bridge Hotel and its historic pedestrian bridge. First built in 1814, and later refurbished by Henry Robertson in 1870, it was considered a marvel of early suspension bridge design. In 1928 the original bridge was destroyed by severe flooding and was rebuilt in its current form from original parts in 1929. The course of the river then takes it through Llangollen and under its 16th-century, Grade I listed bridge. The bridge is also a Scheduled Ancient Monument and considered one of the Seven Wonders of Wales. 

==== Llangollen to Bangor-on-Dee ====
On leaving Llangollen the river continues east, to the south of the Carboniferous Limestone exposures of Eglwyseg Rocks () and Trevor Rocks. Overlooking the river here is the medieval Castell Dinas Brân, a ruined fortress abandoned by John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey in 1282. The river then enters Wrexham County Borough, passing south of Trevor and under Thomas Telford&#x27;s Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, of 1805, which carries the Llangollen Canal overhead.

Less than a mile east of the aqueduct at Cefn Mawr, the river is crossed by the Cefn Mawr Viaduct, built in 1848 by Thomas Brassey and carrying the Shrewsbury to Chester railway line over the Dee. Beyond this point the river forms the boundary between Wrexham County Borough in Wales and Shropshire in the West Midlands of England. Passing Chirk and the confluence with the River Ceiriog, the river begins to trace gentle meanders on the level ground at the beginning of the Cheshire Plain. The course continues past Erbistock on the Welsh side, and the 5th-century earthwork of Wat&#x27;s Dyke on the English, before passing wholly into Wales at Overton bridge. A couple more miles downstream is Bangor-on-Dee, known for its racecourse and its bridge. Until 1974 this area was part of an exclave of historic Flintshire known as English Maelor (). 

==== Bangor to Eaton ====
The Dee continues to meander past Worthenbury where it is joined by the River Clywedog. At this point the border between Wrexham and Cheshire West and Chester follows the course of the river. It passes the Cheshire village of Crewe by Farndon, before cutting between Holt in Wales and Farndon in England beneath the 14th-century, Grade I listed Farndon Bridge.

One of the major tributaries of the Dee, the River Alyn (), crosses the Carboniferous Limestone from Mynydd Helygain (a.k.a. Halkyn Mountain) and runs down through the Loggerheads area before making its confluence north of Holt. Throughout the length of the Alyn there are numerous swallow holes and caverns and during the summer months long stretches of the river bed run dry. These caves include Ogof Hesp Alyn and Ogof Hen Ffynhonnau. A significant part of this lost flow reemerges in the Milwr Tunnel, a manmade tunnel, entering the west bank of the Dee estuary and carrying 12 million imperial gallons per day (600 L/s). This tunnel was originally constructed to drain metal mines in Halkyn Mountain. Once the main River Dee approaches the Cheshire border and the Carboniferous Coal Measures, it turns sharply northwards before meandering up to Chester. This long stretch of the river drops in height by only a few feet. The rich adjoining farmland has many remnants of abandoned coal workings and deep clay pits used to make bricks and tiles. A number of these pits are now being used as landfill sites for domestic and commercial waste. Approaching Churton and Aldford, the river crosses entirely into England, and passes the grand country house of Eaton Hall, seat of the Duke of Westminster. 

==== Eaton to Chester ====
The river then continues past the village of Eccleston and beneath the A55 North Wales Expressway, tracing northwards past the Roman Eaton Road to the Chester suburbs of Huntington and Handbridge before reaching the centre of Chester. In the city centre the river passes and around the Earl&#x27;s Eye(s) meadow at Queen&#x27;s Park. In this vicinity, the riverside is used as a recreation area with a bandstand, benches and boat cruises, being crossed by four bridges. The first is the Queen&#x27;s Park Suspension Bridge, which forms the only exclusively pedestrian footway across the river in Chester. The second is the Old Dee Bridge, a road bridge and by far the oldest bridge in Chester, being built in about 1387 on the site of a series of wooden predecessors which dated originally from the Roman period.

Above the Old Dee Bridge is Chester Weir, which was built by Hugh Lupus to supply power to his corn mills. Throughout the centuries the weir has been used to power corn, fulling, needle, snuff and flint mills. The same weir was used as part of a hydroelectric scheme in 1911 with the help of a small generator building which is still visible today, used as a pumping station for water since 1951. However the first water pumping station here was set up in 1600 by John Tyrer who pumped water to a square tower built on the city&#x27;s Bridgegate. It was destroyed in the Civil War but an octagonal tower built in 1690 for the same purpose lasted until the gate was replaced with an arch in the mid-18th century.

On this weir is a fish pass and fish counting station to monitor the numbers of salmon ascending the river, and also a weirgate for navigating the weir at spring tides. A little further downstream stands the Grosvenor Bridge (designed by architect Thomas Harrison of Chester), which was opened in 1833 to ease congestion on the Old Dee Bridge. This bridge was opened by Princess Victoria five years before she became Queen.

The other side of the Grosvenor Bridge is the Roodee, Chester&#x27;s racecourse and the oldest course in the country. This used to be the site of Chester&#x27;s Roman harbour until, aided by the building of the weir, the River Dee silted up to become the size it is today. The only curiously remaining reminder of this site&#x27;s maritime past is a stone cross which stands in the middle of the Roodee which exhibits the marks of water ripples. To the end of the Roodee the river is crossed by Chester&#x27;s fourth bridge which carries the North Wales Coast railway line, before leaving Chester. This was the scene of one of the first serious railway accidents in the country, the Dee bridge disaster.

===Canalised section===

West of Chester, the river flows along an artificial channel excavated by the between 1732 and 1736. The work was planned and undertaken by engineers from the Netherlands and paid for by local merchants and Chester Corporation. It was an attempt to improve navigation for shipping and reduce silting. Chester&#x27;s trade had declined steadily since the end of the 17th century as sediment had prevented larger craft reaching the city, spelling the end for the Port of Chester.

After four years&#x27; work, the river was diverted from its meandering natural course which passed Blacon, Saughall, Shotwick Castle, Burton and Parkgate and up the west shore of Wirral. Instead, the new canalised section followed the coast along northeast Wales. During this time, Sealand and Shotton were reclaimed from the estuary. Land reclamation in this area continued until 1916. The river&#x27;s natural course can still be determined by following the bank and low bluffs that mark the western edge of the Wirral Peninsula.

The manmade channel, which runs in a straight line for , passes into Wales and Flintshire at Saltney. On the west shore is Hawarden Airport and the large Airbus factory at Broughton. This region is known as Deeside and contains several heavy industries. From here the Dee passes beneath three road bridges. The first two are adjacent to each other at Queensferry. They are a 1960s fixed-arch bridge carrying the A494 Queensferry to Dolgellau trunk road and its predecessor the Jubilee Bridge, which is a rolling bascule bridge completed in 1926. The third crossing, and the most recent, is at Connah&#x27;s Quay. The Flintshire Bridge is a fixed cable-stayed bridge that opened in 1999.

Between the second and third road bridges is Hawarden railway bridge at Shotton, originally constructed as a swing bridge but now never opened. It carries the to Borderlands Line over the river. station serves the Deeside Industrial Park, Deeside Power Station and the works at Dee Marsh.

A footbridge replaced the passenger ferry at Saltney in the 1970s.

===Estuary===

Beyond Connah&#x27;s Quay the river opens out into the Dee Estuary, forming the northeasternmost section of the North Wales coast and the western coast of the Wirral. Towns along the coast include Flint, Holywell and Mostyn on the Welsh side and Neston, Parkgate, Heswall, West Kirby and Hoylake on the Wirral side. South of Bagillt and Parkgate the Dee Estuary forms the boundary between the local authority areas of Flintshire and Cheshire West and Chester. Northwards it forms the boundary with the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral in Merseyside, North West England. The estuary continues to widen until finally entering the Irish Sea and Liverpool Bay between the northernmost point of mainland Wales, Point of Ayr at Talacre, Flintshire and Hilbre Point, near Hoylake and West Kirby in Wirral, Merseyside. Hilbre Island, part of Wirral, straddles the mouth of the estuary at this point. The waters of the Dee then converge with those of the River Mersey and Ribble, producing a notable drop in salinity and increase in sediment which can be tracked a considerable distance along the Sefton and Lancashire coasts.

The estuary is hugely important for birdlife and has been designated both as an SSSI and as a Ramsar site accordingly. Its value lies in the huge expanses of mud which are exposed between tides and the extensive saltmarsh developed on both sides but principally on the right bank north and south of Neston.

The estuary owes its origins to the scouring of a broad channel through the Triassic sandstones and Carboniferous mudstones by glacial ice during successive ice ages to form an iceway. The channel continues inland south of Chester but its higher reaches have long since been infilled with sand, gravel and mud. The process of infilling by mud continues to the present day as the rapid growth of the saltmarsh in the last century testifies, pushing the high tide line further out into the estuary.

==Uses==

===Industry===
Large parts of the catchment are devoted to agriculture and there a number of abstractions made from the river for summer irrigation. The volumes involved are not however significant.

From Chirk downstream, the river valley has supported a wide range of industries that were initially drawn to the area by the presence of coal mines and later by the deep deposits of Carboniferous clays used to make bricks and tiles.

The coal industry in particular gave rise to a number of chemical industries some of which survive to this day and which both take water from the river and discharge their cleaned up effluent back into the river. Industries in the valley include commercial chemicals manufacture, wood chip and MDF fabrication, cocoa milling, fibreglass manufacture, waste disposal (in old clay pits) and a great variety of smaller industries concentrated around Wrexham. The main impact on the river of these industries is their thirst for a dependable good quality water supply.

Previously the wings for the Airbus A380, which were made at Airbus&#x27;s manufacturing factory in Broughton, were taken downriver by barge to the Port of Mostyn because they were too large to be shipped in an Airbus Beluga. However, the dredging of the river for the barge may be responsible for a weakening of the tidal bore.

===Abstractions===
There are a number of direct water abstractions upstream of Chester by three water companies and by the canal. The size of the abstraction is very large compared to the summer flow and the flow in the river is very highly regulated through the use of reservoirs to store water in the winter and release it in the summer. The whole system is managed as the Dee Regulation Scheme.
Below Chester water is also abstracted as cooling water by the gas-fired power station at Connah&#x27;s Quay. Process and cooling water is also abstracted for the paper mill and power station at Shotton.

===Water sport===
The Dee used to be a popular whitewater kayaking and touring river (particularly the grade III/IV whitewater section upstream of Llangollen). It stays high after rain for longer than most British rivers and is paddleable year-round (thanks to the Dee Regulation Scheme). Canoeing used to be allowed on about twelve weekends per year, and tens of thousands of canoeists descended on Llangollen for recreational paddling (several Dee tours were held every winter), slalom competitions, and wild water races.

In 2003, negotiations with the angling associations owning fishing rights on the Dee broke down. The anglers wanted to restrict the numbers of paddlers on the river when paddling was allowed but the Welsh Canoe Association wanted to renew the previous agreement. In November 2004, a protest about the lack of access on the Dee, and to rivers across England and Wales, was held in Llangollen. Following the failure of the access agreement, the Welsh Canoeing Association advises canoeists to use their own judgement about using the river, which in practice means many canoeists use the river at will from the numerous access points along its banks.

Canoeing is permitted on one 100 m long rapid, 1 km upstream of Llangollen. Wildwater and slalom races are still held at Serpent&#x27;s Tail rapid upstream of Llangollen.

A major tributary of the Dee, the River Tryweryn, supports a wide range of water sports and hosts the Canolfan Tryweryn - the national white water centre for Wales.

Each July the Chester Raft Race is held on the Dee in aid of charity.

The Deva (Chester) Triathlon uses the Dee for the swim leg of the race.

The rowing clubs on the Dee are Royal Chester Rowing Club (hosting also Chester University Rowing Club) and Grosvenor Rowing Club. King&#x27;s School Rowing Club and Queens Park High School are school-dedicated rowing clubs. All these share the slightly meandering Chester/lower reach above the weir.

===Fishing===
The river has been famed as a mixed fishery with salmon and trout fishing, mostly in the upper waters and a good coarse fishery in the lower reaches. A major pollution incident in the middle reaches in the late 1990s did extensive damage to the fishery from which it is now largely recovered.
==Site of Special Scientific Interest==
Afon Dyfrdwy (River Dee) is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in the preserved county of Clwyd, along the River Dee, as is the nearby River Dee (England) SSSI in England. The Dee Cliffs at Farndon, Cheshire, are designated as a separate SSSI, as are the Dee Marshes on the northern (English) side of the estuary.

The river has been designated as a Special Area of Conservation because of its role as a habitat for Atlantic salmon and floating water plantain.
